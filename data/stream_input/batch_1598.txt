B008MEM24S|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!  It's just like Where's My Water but easyer.  It helped teach my mom how to play Where's My Water. It's TOTALLY worth the money.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Not sure what everyone is fussing about. This app works GREAT!! It has everything you want/need and it functions perfectly. DEFINITELY recommend this as an excellent weather resource!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|When I first got the game it was fun. Then when I was moving my bowling alley it went of the edge of my village so I have to buy the part of land that its on to get it back &gt;:(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I was not going to read this series of books because I thougt it would be a book of smut.  When all my friends were raving about the books I decided to see what they were talking about.  I must say I thourghly enjoyed the books amd was pleasantly surprised to see it was a love story.  When people asked me what I thought I told them it was a love story that they sould read.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|I have all four of the books.  The story is quite interesting and I especially like his treatment of magic.  Of all the books, I enjoyed Brisingr the most.  A great read.<br />Rick
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Not what I thought at all...super faced paced book and I read it in hours. I was so impressed with the true to life character developments. They were so strong and compelling which is hard to do so quickly and Colleen really pulled it off. The poetry in this book was amazing. I was impressed that the author could write so well and add poetry in such an amazing way. Everything about the plot was so emotional and overwhelming at time. I cried, I laughed and I sighed. This book was incredible and I didn't want it to stop. Life, Love & Death...it all happens. I am excited for book two...
B00005A0B7|5.0|Man, they don't make 'em like this anymore.  I've wanted this album for years and finally got the LP.  What a great piece of Memphis soul by a pair of Stax legends.  I'm just getting back into LP's but this is the rich sound I think I came back for.  A super price too.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie adaptation is closer to the book than a lot of movie adaptations I have recently seen.  There are a few minor things that are left out (such as some of the extra technology things in the capital like automatic food and the super shower).  However, the main plot points from the book are included and mostly with great detail.  They did stay away from making it too violent, which I am assuming was to make it appropriate for a wider-range of viewers.  For viewers that are hoping for a violent war movie, you will likely be disappointed.  For those that are more interested in the storyline than the actual violence, you will enjoy this adaptation.  There are some violent scenes that may not be appropriate for young children, but I would say it is appropriate for older children (10+) that are allowed to watch other movies with violet moments (such as Harry Potter).  This is definitely more mature than the Harry Potter films, but could appeal to the same demographic of upper elementary and middle school children, while still appealing to adults.  I highly recommend this movie as a fan of the unique novels.
B004SKQAJI|4.0|Saw Michael in London years ago doing both Riverdance and Lord of the Dance and was quite dismayed when he went quiet and disappeared off the scene....but now the boy is back ! I've seen every incarnation of LOTD and found this one to be more glitzy. Was a tad disappointed to see a couple of sequences deleted from the show BUT it was good to see Michael still keeping his hand (feet) in !!
1597801585|3.0|The Wind Up Girl, is an adult dystopian novel based in a future Bangkok.  Let me start with what I did not particularity like.  This novel received many awards, including the Hugo award for best novel in 2010, and though I do not argue with the decision, I do not agree either.  The title made me think the novel would be centered around Emiko, the wind up girl, it really was not.  The focus of the book was wide ranging around several individuals.  I usually dive into and love dark sci-fi, dystopian, but I was left on the outside looking in on this one.  The book itself honestly took me almost three months to read. I had to keep putting it down because I just didn't seem to care what happened.  I found no connection to any of the characters.  I have also read Ship Breakers, a dystopian YA novel written by Bacigalupi and had the same problem with that book as this one where I had a hard time understanding this future that he creates.  All dystopian novels can have this problem, with names being made up and places changing.  It took me about one third of the way into the book to understand the calorie/currency based government.  Without serious spoilers, I do have to mention that the book did not seem to come to a complete ending, leaving many questions hanging.<br />What I did like was world he created (once I understood it completely).  It is a disturbing view of a possible future of corporate greed running rapid, humans struggling to survive, and genetically modified food that kills millions.  I really loved the \\"cheshire\\" cats that were genetically modified and became like rats in the alleys.  They set a great tone for the desperation of the city streets.<br />This just isn't a book I read over again. I will put it away and if anyone asks, I will honestly tell them, yes read it, but don't have high expectations.<br />Other Hugo awards I would recommend: The Graveyard Book, by Neil Gaiman - Dune, by Frank Herbert, and Enders Game by Orson Scott Card.<br /><br />Thisis my honest review - Joanna NorCalBookBlog
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|LOts of Fun.  Love playing Nerf guns with my boys and the Semi automatic action of this gun is lots of fun.  Gun assembles very easily and seems to be somewhat durable.  The gun comes with four clips and 24 darts.  The box says the gun can shoot up to (which hold just six darts)144 bullets but that is where the money part comes in. You have to buy 8 of the 18 shot clips which are $10+ apiece. They do have the hail fire mission kit which has 4 more 6shot clips for $15+ which would bring you to a total of 48 shots.  Overall lots of fun but you really need the extra for the whole experience of playing with the gun.  Also only works with the clip system darts.
0525953728|5.0|I will keep this very simple...THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!  It has not been filtered out by anyone with a political agenda...A very well written account of the events that day...and a very quick read at that!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is really great. I've been watching my freinds play this for so long on their Ipods! I was overjoyed when I saw it for Kindle Fire!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Such badly written rubbish I have never read before. I bought it because of all the hype, and I knew from the beginning it would be hard to stick. The heroine is dreadful, she's a disgrace to women and Mr Grey is so rude, I wouldn't touch him with yours. I said I'll stick it out till the first rudey bit, which was possibly the least sexy thing I've ever read, so I switched off my kindle and asked my boyfriend to send me a rude email instead, much better. Save your money ladies

B000063Y8F|5.0|Heavy-duty garlic press: can put in 1 or 2 UNPEELED garlic cloves, give it a squeeze & out pops finely minced garlic! No more papery peels all over your fingers & kitchen.  Also, the inside opens up for easy rinsing under the tap (but it all still stays attached so no loose parts).  Will definitely be using more garlic in my cooking; this makes it so easy to use fresh garlic!  Great gift for yourself and other cooks.
B001VNB54A|4.0|My copy of the Pacific does not have the Tom Hanks narration at the beginning.  Is this normal?  Did anyone else have this problem?
1451608659|4.0|First off- why didn't I give the book 5 stars if I enjoyed it so much? Well, the writing itself is very simple and conversational. I typically prefer a little bit more complexity but I was able to get past that because this is a story that sucks you in.<br /><br />I was a young girl when Dominique was helping the US win gold at the 1996 Olympics. I remember just loving her. Her routines had so much spunk and she seemed to radiate positivity. At the time there was a brief biography of her that was geared toward school-age children. It was very light and sweet. When I picked up Off Balance I had no idea that Dominique competed at the Olympics in the face of a lot of personal turmoil. From a cruel coach to a loveless and at times violent father, it amazes me that a little girl was able to withstand the negativity and not just survive but actually thrive. Through all her struggles, she never blames the sport (which I appreciated). Rather, she blames those around her who took her hobby and used it to turn her into a machine.<br /><br />Her story is at times heartbreaking. You can't miss the sad irony of wondering if her sister (who was born without legs and given up for adoption) had a much happier childhood than the daughter/star gymnast their parents kept.<br /><br />This is very moving story and just goes to show how one's attitude plays such a huge role in life. I never would have guessed at all of Dominique's struggles from just seeing her perform and interact with the media. I also found her critique of the state of women's gymnastics in the US (especially in regard to the Olympic selection and training process) to be valid and a worthy talking point. I absolutely recommend this book for a quick and fascinating read.
0618871713|5.0|Alison Bechdel's life story lives up to the saying, \\"You can't make this stuff up.\\" Growing up lesbian in a small town had to be bad enough, but growing up the daughter of a closeted gay funeral home director who jumped in front of an oncoming truck...well, you can't make this stuff up. Even if you are not familiar with Bechdel's fabulous comic Dykes to Watch Out For, you'll be sucked into this graphic novel that tells the story of her family life and how she discovered her dad's secret life. Gay or not, anyone who has been a teenager will relate to her memories of dealing with adolescence, sex and self-image. Bechdel incorporates snippets from her childhood diaries and her dad's letters and photos into the comic strip. I would have liked to know more about her mom, but that is not the focus of this book since (at the time she writes about) she did not know her mom's side of the story either. I read this book in one sitting and could not put it down....it was like being inside someone's head (someone very smart and funny).
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app! It has very accurate weather readings and works well on my Kindle Fire. I love it more than Weatherbug!! I encourage you to download this app!

B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is my favorite of the Avengers silhouettes. The most intelligent female supporting role falls for the most godly hero. All the acting is spot on. The sound is mind blowing. The CGI is flawless.
0553801473|5.0|This book continues George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series with extravagant and satisfying grace.  It's at least as good as the first four books.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|\\"Pain demands to be felt...\\"<br /><br />I am adding a new shelf after reading this book....Books that make you literally cry.<br /><br />I was sobbing!!<br /><br />This is about a group of friends that have one major thing in common...they all have cancer. Hazel is a 16 year old girl who has to depend on a oxygen tank for the rest of her life. She attends a cancer support group where she meets Augustus. Gus is an amazing boy who is now healthy because they cut off his leg to prevent the cancer from spreading. He is full of life, witty, good looking...and he is amazed by Hazel. He stares at her the first time he sees her though the entire support group meeting. They become friends and develop their relationship to more...they are witty and I found myself laughing at their dialogue. They are friends with Issac, another cancer patient, who had to have his eyes removed....can't these kids catch a break.<br /><br />The ending is hurtful!! My heart hurt. I just couldn't deal with how when cancer progresses...changes a person much. Their spirit dies long before their body does...it was like a completely different person.<br /><br />I don't think I can re-read this book because I can't go through that again but I recommend everyone read it once!!
B000089RVX|5.0|There are enough long in depth detailed reviews of this record so i'll spare you a long page after page rant.<br />The short version: This is a killer debut and amy lee is, well honestly their aren't words to describe her.  The combination of her voice and lyrics hits you in the deepest parts of your heart and soul, yes this record made me cry, it gets that emotional.  It should also be noted that although this primarily is a \\"metal\\" album, there are a good amount of classical influences textured in everywhere.  Do yourself a favor, get this album
B007SYWFRM|5.0|we uee the game for many learning activities... from placing animals of similar species together to using math to accommodate the bonus decorations to gain the most coins... and it's FUN!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I've loved this movie nearly all my life. (According to my parents) I know every word. It's a very unique movie with great music. For a long time, I only had the VHS. It was definitely time to upgrade, and the Blu-ray version is beautiful.

B000YXMMAO|3.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time and the quality of the vinyl is impeccable.  I had originally bought the album the day it came out with the pay-what-you-want deal.  However, I had lost the mp3 files at some point and I had been craving to listen to this album again.  I was hoping that this would come with a download card as well so I could also enjoy the album on the go.  If you just want the vinyl, then this is the perfect option.  If you are looking for a download card, beware that this does not contain one.
B005KELW26|4.0|It is exactly as advertised but nicer!  I would have given it five stars BUT the magnetic flap kind of gets in my way.  I adore the color, the texture and it is perfect for my Kindle Fire.  I would highly recomment it.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I saw this group perform on Tonight show...I was sucked in by \\"Little Talks\\". After checking them out online, I bought their CD. Let me just say...they are a unique group that puts out some great songs. No duds in this album. \\"Little Talks\\" probably still my favorite, but several more are close. At first, the girl singers voice seemed a bit strange...kinda weird the way she chopped her words...thought maybe it was an Icelandic thing...??<br />But, the more I listened the more I started to appreciate her uniqueness. I think all the songs where the guy singer and her go back and forth are my favorites. Their voices create a kind of Synergy where together they are quite amazing. I have continued to listen to this CD over and over and I have yet to tire of it...which is a key for me as to how good the music is...I did the same thing with the last CD from Coldplay. Before you think I'm a music lightweight...my favorite musician is Neil Young...so, my street cred is legit...:)<br />I think the criticism from those saying all the songs sound the same is lame...they don't...there is a quality and a theme to the songs, but this is a CD...think Beatles Sgt. Pepper's album...themes are a good thing.<br />I will be waiting to see how their next CD plays out...hope they stand the test of time...

0446541478|5.0|This book illustrates why the Jews, when you consider the lengthy list of their towering achievements, are so far ahead of everybody else in the world.  This book just blew me away!<br /><br />Consider this: If the Israelis laid down their arms, how long would it be before they were attacked?  Immediately!  But if Hezbollah and the Arabs laid down their arms, what would the Israelis do?  Nothing!<br /><br />Consider that beyond the comparatively huge number of Israeli start-up companies listed on NASDAQ, and the huge disparity in patents registered in contrast with other countries both near and far, that Israel is the only country in the world with a receding desert.  Unbelievable!<br /><br />It strikes me as ridiculous that intellectual frauds (and heroes of the political left) like Noam Chomsky can be so critical of Israel when all he does is rub grievances and create dissent, while  Israel creates prosperity and surplus for everyone, far in excess of their numbers.<br /><br />The 'Left' is truly \\"missing a chip.\\"

B0012GVKVY|5.0|I've read I Robot and while this is not that book it's a fun action film with clever sci-fi elements. But Alan Tudyk's Sonny is the heart of this story.  I'm a big Tudyk fan.  And of course I had to have in Blu-ray and this looks great.

B00005YU1O|5.0|Very happy with the service, received the movie in two days (YAY AMAZON PRIME) furthermore, the film is amazing, I can't express that enough.  AMAZING. If you are into philosophy, and actually have an IQ worth keeping around, you'll get all the little paradoxes, nuances, and ruminations that the film explores about life.

B0052GACNM|5.0|After listening to Tony Bennett's Duets CD it became impossible not to try Duets II even though I doubted he could improve on it; my doubts were completely unjustified:  Lady Gaga's The Lady is a Tramp and Amy Winehouse with Body and Soul would make this CD a bargain at twice Amazon's price.  Fifteen more great artists and song make four times would still be a steal!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|You may as well order all 3 cuz you will want them.  They keep you reading and wanting more. The first one ends in such a way that you have to order the second. Don't usually go for romance novels, but was halfway thru the second book before I realized that this was a ( hot hot hot) romance novel. Go ahead, you know you want to, order them now.
0756407125|5.0|I'm absolutely intimated at the level of cleverness and whit that Patrick Rothfuss has ingratiated into this second installation of the King-killer Chronicles.  Not only is he a talented story weaver, but these two novels are filled with such knowledge, whit, and character development that it would make any fantasy nerd blush.  I did quite a few times, actually.<br /><br />If you love a simple story with the regular fantasy formula, this isn't a tale for you.  However, if you love a good puzzle, an over-abundance of science, history, philosophy, mythology, magic - well, a dire thirst for cleverness, then this is a must read.  Yet, the genius of Rothfuss is not in the level of intelligent ingredients he weaved into this tale - it's that he makes his work of art look easy.<br /><br />I love Kvothe, not for his genius, his quick wit, or his talent with music and magic, but for his fallibility, his naivety, and his ignorant innocence.  Most of all, I love his drive, his hope, his bravery in the face of adversity, his failures and weaknesses - and despite his confessions, I love his desire for justice.  These might be all the traditional elements of a fantasy hero that have been written out thousands of times before, but what makes that formula great is the fact it works.  Rothfuss, along with a few other authors I've read lately like Michael J. Sullivan, Anthony Ryan, and R.T. Kaelin, really have learned the secret to good character development.<br /><br />In a story about heroes, it's not always what must be done, or the powers they have, that make them great, but who they must become as a person in order to fulfill their destiny.  The process from discovering destiny - to the point of fulfilling it - that is the story.  In the King-Killer Chronicles, The Name of the Wind, Kvothe is introduced at the height of his innocence and the beginning of his thirst for knowledge and wonder of the universe around him.  He is full of all the awe, wonder, and wild-eyed amazement of childhood as he steps lightly onto the path of his destiny.  Then, controversy and adversity descends upon him with the murder of his parents and the introduction of the Chandrian, disrupting that innocence, and introducing him to the path of development of his character.  In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe begins to grow up and face the hard realities of his decisions, life and what lay ahead for him.  THIS is what I love about his series.  Rothfuss doesn't tell us a story, he allows Kvothe to reveal it to us in a slow development that involves all emotion and intellect.  The result:  readers become emotionally and intellectually invested, rooting for the hero because of the hero, not the quest.<br /><br />It is this formula that I'm discovering and loving in the epic fantasies I've read lately.  I hope I can apply it to my own stories, and with authors like Rowling, Rothfuss, Sullivan, Kaelin and Sanderson, I think I've got some great inspirations to use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series, and I want to again thank Michael J. Sullivan for his recommendation.<br /><br />Till next time,<br />~T.L. Gray<br />Author of the Arcainian Serieschildhood as he steps lightly onto the path of his destiny.

Sullivan for his recommendation.<br /><br />Till next time,<br />~T.L. Gray<br />Author of the Arcainian Series
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I remember every October first watching this movie with my mother in our opening of Halloween month, (great tradition, everyone should do it! Where you have a day at the beginning of the month where you watch Halloween movies, eat some early candy and pick out your costume and have the whole month to make it!) and as a kid it scared the pee out of me! But as I got older I really started to get the jokes and it was less scary and far more enjoyable and now as an adult I love it!<br /><br />The transfer to blu-ray was excellent! The picture is brighter and crisper, and the sound is ten fold better! My one beef with the whole thing is that there is no freaking bonus features! But for the price, getting a blu-ray and DVD of a great movie I can't complain!<br /><br />All in all the movie is just as awesome as I remember it being! I would highly recommend this movie for everyone! Now go get you some popcorn put some candy corn and m&m's in it and pop in this bad girl and watch it with your loved ones!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the TV series \\"Shark Tank.\\" This was an interesting personal insight into how Cuban acquired his success. Other reviewers have slammed the book for being a rehash of Cuban's blog, but since I don't follow the blog, the content was all fresh to me. Very interesting success story.

B0085KGHI6|4.0|This DVD is over all a very entertaining glimpse of a very special night in music history. Being from Chicago I was especially interested in seeing this.<br />I was at the Rolling Stones show in Chicago & wondered where they all went after the show that night. I guess we all know now! Wish I had been there!
0385360185|1.0|I'd had the paperback version of this and I admit fully that I'd bought books two and three shortly after I started reading book one. FSoG isn't exactly Shakespeare, but it has a really fun campy quality to it that I truly enjoyed. Then came book two, which had some fun parts but was sort of overly long and more than a little dull at points. Now I've finished book three and I can safely say that books two and three should've been condensed and mixed into one book. This was really the weakest one of the bunch. It's not helped by the fact that Random House chose the worst narrator possible for this.<br /><br />Where to start with what went wrong with this book? There's a lot of repetition in this book. I know that James might've been writing this in installments and as such, wasn't as aware of how many times she used the same phrases in this book. The constant \\"Oh my\\" and \\"Mr/s Grey\\" was pretty annoying to the point where I literally had to switch off the audio book because I was ready to toss my iPod onto the ground in frustration. The many slow and plodding parts of the book are further enhanced by it being spoken because it makes it that much more noticeable. There's some decent enough ideas here, I guess, but I don't think that we needed over 500 pages to tell them. It's overkill. There's only so many times we need to go through the whole \\"Yaargh, I want to bang Christian so badly and he wants to bang me, oh now he's all freaky control freak\\" thing.<br /><br />Then there's Christian. I know that this is all new for him and that he might go into protective overdrive as a husband, but he turned into a snarling neanderthal in this book. I lost a lot of respect for Ana, that she kept putting up with him and making excuses for his attitude. No matter how bad his childhood was, that's not an excuse for his actions and I got frustrated that it took so long for Ana to finally start saying \\"get over it and move on\\". Even then she kept doing this \\"oh gee, I guess that all of this is because you were abused/neglected as a kid so it's all OK\\". She caved too many times and in situations where she shouldn't have. The repetition of these scenes made all of this that much more annoying.<br /><br />This all might have been easily overlooked if not for the very, VERY poor choice of Becca Battoe as the narrator. Bluntly put, Battoe narrates everything in the same tone of voice with little to no alteration in her vocal patterns. She might have a pleasant and even voice, but you shouldn't use the same tone to narrate a sex scene and a bracelet purchasing scene. It makes everything boring. The narrator also makes Ana seem like a moronic bimbo. I never thought that Ana was Mommy's Little Mensa Maid, but I never really thought that she was as vapid as Battoe makes her sound. Add on the incredibly poor accents and Battoe pretty much strikes out on everything. Especially the sex scenes. I could forgive the other failings, but if you're going to read a sex scene then at least try to make it hot. I blame part of this on Random House because from what I can see, Battoe has never narrated anything with this sort of content in it. If I hadn't googled her, I'd have sworn that this was her first audiobook, but no- she frequently narrates children and YA books. I really felt that Battoe's narration was what put the final nail in this coffin and I can't help but feel that if Random House had gone with a narrator that is specifically experienced in narrating sex (Tavia Gilbert is amazing), the book would have been dramatically improved. I honestly for the life of me can't figure out why they chose Battoe. I think I'd rather have listened to Gilbert Godfried narrate this. Harsh, but I've listen to enough top notch narrations to know that this was a particularly poor job.<br /><br />If you want to read this, skip the audiobook and go for the paper version. You'll still run into the problems of a lagging plot and overly repetitious scenes but you'll be spared Battoe's narration. I'm really glad that I got this through my local library rather than purchased it because this really was awful. If you must get this, get it through the library. I'd give this two stars except that Battoe really spoiled the narration for me.<br /><br />1 out of 5 starstoe's narration.

B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Greedy Spiders 2 is a cute game and is quite challenging as you get into higher levels. The graphics are nice and works perfectly on Kindle fire.<br /><br />The controls are simple to use and there is total of 144 levels for fun. As you start playing you will notice that this is more of a \\"strategy\\" based game more or less like [[ASIN:B007UQ9NK0 Burn The Rope +]]. There can be situations wherein you may have to freeze spiders as they work in a team to trap you. I personally hate spiders so virtually I feel better when I win. It is child friendly game and if your child loves to play with bugs and spiders this game will definitely keep them engaged for a long time.<br /><br />The game does have access to internet and shows video via you-tube, The permissions need full internet access and view the network state.<br /><br />It is good game nonetheless. Worthy of 99C!<br /><br />Have fun!

1439102430|2.0|I loved her first books.  I really did.  And then after she started working on the TV show, her books started to suck.  Yup, I'm saying it.  They started to suck.  And even though her last book showed a hint of the old novels, this one is probably one of the worst I've read.<br /><br />This is from my review of her last book, Flash and Bones:<br /><br />\\"My only issue is that Tempe always ends up in danger at the end of each book and has to be rescued. After awhile, you would think that the police would insert a tracking device under her skin, because they know if she is working on a case, she will end up kidnapped.\\"<br /><br />Hey, guess what happens in this book?  No, you'll never guess.  Nope, I'm just going to tell you.  It ends like every other Tempe Brennan novel:  She gets kidnapped at the end and has to be rescued.  And NO, I did not just ruin it for you because THAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF EVERY KATHY REICHS BOOK.<br /><br />We're back in Canada for this one.  It starts out promising, as Tempe has just found three dead babies in an apartment.  I'm intrigued, I'm ready to go.  Andrew Ryan is along for the ride.  Yup, getting excited to solve this mystery with them.  And then, it all falls apart.  Characters are added, but you don't care about them.  They're bad guys who you never actually talk to - they're spoken to off of the page.  The new detective with whom Tempe has a past is a jerk and there are no redeeming qualities, even though Reichs tries to point them out.<br /><br />We do learn a little about diamond mining and the native population of Canada.  But all it made me feel was sad and cold.  I don't feel like learning more about either subject, which is sad because I'm sure that they're both fascinating when they're not presented as the backdrop to a crappy story.<br /><br />I just wanted it to be over.  It was not a pleasurable read at all.<br /><br />I do have a suggestion for Ms. Reichs:  Start a new storyline with Tempe's daughter, Katy.  Take her through the learning process of whatever career she's going to choose.  Throw in some crime.  Have Katy and Tempe work together.  Do SOMETHING because what you're writing is not working.<br /><br />Bad.  Just bad.through the learning process of whatever career she's going to choose.  Throw in some crime.

0385742886|4.0|This series has improved with each book. This may be because I am already familiar with the world and, for the original trilogy, the characters.<br /><br />One thing I liked going into this book was that most, if not all, the characters were probably going to die. There is a lot of violence in this novel. I don't mean, just fist-to-fist combat. Those infected with what becomes known as The Flare are brutal. Children are fighting over dead bodies. Others are eating each other alive. Many try to kill themselves. Dashner did a nice job portraying the brutality of this Apocalyptic world.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the Prologue and the Epilogue. They both connected this prequel to the original trilogy. I am unsure if something was inferred as to one of the characters that may have survived (Do we already know this person older?). If you have read the book already and understand what I'm talking about, did you think this as well?<br /><br />The technology in this prequel was more believable to me than in the original trilogy. The only crazy, out there piece of technology was the flat trans, which is like a Transporter from Star Trek. There is also a gun that utilizes the same technology.<br /><br />I liked the way there were two different time lines being told through dreams. I also liked that within these stories, some characters had already died in one while they were still alive in the dreams of the past.<br /><br />This was a really good survival/adventure story. Each of the members of the group were interesting and had their own styles or surviving. This is definitely a Young Adult novel for boys (as in, boys will like this more than most YA, but girls will enjoy this book as well).<br /><br />If you enjoy Post Apocalyptic Survival/Adventure stories or have read The Maze Runner trilogy, this is a must read. If you know a middle grade boy reader, these books would make an excellent present. I give this novel a 4/5.<br /><br />-PAUL
0345522478|4.0|Hounded is a truly interesting book.  The concept is one that has both been done to death before, and yet I have never seen it executed the way it was in this book.  The basic premise is that the main character is a 2100 year old druid living in the modern day era.  Turns out that we don't actually live alone, and instead there is actually a rather large paranormal community surrounding us that we don't notice.  This is not a new idea at all, and has been done almost to perfection a-la Dresden Files.<br /><br />That being said, there really aren't any other books that capture the lightheartedness that Hearne presents in the book.  Yes, there is tension.  Atticus faces some of the typical problems that you would expect the last druid to face as well as some problems you would not expect.  His dog provides absolutely golden comedic relief, and there is a refreshing array of characters that are either not clich&eacute; or are clich&eacute;d but put into a proper perspective and not annoying to read.<br /><br />That being said, the book is far from perfect.  Atticus is said not to be one of the stronger players in the game, and yet he escapes from practically every situation with little damage and minor repercussions.  In some instances this is believable since he is just older, wiser, and more powerful than his foes.  In others it is somewhat suspect since the book spends long portions of time explaining how he has been running his whole life so as to avoid angering higher powers and avoiding confrontations.  Then, all of a sudden he is a battle expert who is taking on those that frightened him so badly?<br /><br />I'm not saying that he should get his ass kicked all the time the way that some other main characters in series do.  He is after all one of the most elder beings in the books, but at the same time some balance and true struggle should be given to balance things out.<br /><br />There is also a lack of character depth in the book.  This is most likely due to how short the book is, and the lack of ability to flesh them out.  It is a detriment to the book though.  While I found it a lot of fun to read, at no point was I truly attached to the characters the way I am in some other series.  If someone got killed off here or there I would have found myself kind of shrugging and saying whatever.  There are a few exceptions to this rule, but with all the characters that are introduced there should most certainly be more characters that I feel involved with.<br /><br />All that being said though, it is an enjoyable read and that's how I rate stories.  I do not think it will be up for any awards the way it is currently written, but I do think that it will provide a lot of fun for those that enjoy this type of story.  It reminded me a bit of a mix of the Bartimaeus Trilogy and Dresden Files.  You can also tell where some of Butcher's writing style has probably influenced Hearne because at times they are very similar.  In some instances it works, in others it falls a bit flat.<br /><br />Overall I would give this about a 3.8/5, rounded up to a 4.ow short the book is, and the lack of ability to flesh them out.

0061692042|1.0|Boring book that plodded along.  Excruciating plot details that went nowhere. For instance, why did Berner seem sick the morning they were planning to go to Seattle?  I thought perhaps she was pregnant, but no, that plot detail just fizzled.  A shocking incest scene that was completely unnecessary except for making the narrator appear to have severe mental problems.  What kind of 15 year old thinks nothing of sleeping with his twin sister?!  And then we are supposed to believe he really is perfectly sane and is capable of being a school teacher?  There are only 2 main plot points and the author tells us about them both chapters before they finally occur.  There's no suspense, it was just so slow and boring.  I was surprised when the narrator mentioned he had been in Canada for only 6 weeks, it felt like forever.  I can't believe all of the hype about his book, I was severely disappointed.

0061914177|4.0|Imagine a world where you wake up every day and instead of dreading the day ahead your job aligns perfectly with your passion.  You feel what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls \\"flow\\" as you go about making your living.  Gary Vaynerchuk, the wine aficionado behind the hugely successful site winelibrarytv.com, wants you to have that life and he wrote Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion to help you get there.<br /><br />Vaynerchuk argues that following your passion to build what he calls your \\"personal brand\\" and generating great content using the power and influence of the internet can enable anyone to build a community that can eventually be monetized to make the life of your dreams.  Like a tech-savvy Tony Robbins, Vaynerchuk paints a picture of success and riches we all dream of, but is his story of success easy enough to replicate in our own lives?<br /><br />Using catchy aphorisms like \\"skills are cheap, passion is priceless\\", \\"be authentic, be yourself\\" and \\"the only difference is passion and hustle\\" the author is like a life-coach on steroids, screaming in our ears to seize the moment, our passion and our life.<br /><br />He provides plenty of useful tips as starting points to begin to build our empire, but don't expect specific strategies on building your internet domain.  Rather use this book as motivation when things are down and your spirit is sagging.  Vaynerchuk points the reader in the right direction, but like most things in life his useful advice amounts to little if not followed by action on the would-be entrepreneur's part.<br /><br />Near the start of the book Vaynerchuk says:  Love your family, Work superhard and Live your passion.  Sound advice to begin any book on entrepreneurship, and using those three admonitions plus the clear steps he provides will put anyone one step closer to success in any online venture.

0743455967|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Stephen King -- mostly because I am easily frightened -- but I have enjoyed some of his non-frightening books such as The Stand.  However, I bought this book because am always looking for resources on writing, and this book received good reviews.  In the beginning, Stephen King shares how he was drawn to writing, his methodology for writing, and simply tips about what works for him and what has worked for his students.  The second part of the book is about a near-death experience that he had and how writing was one of the keys to his recovery.  I found it to be a valuable and inspirational book, as it encourages anyone with a passion to write to do so, and explains how writing should be integral to a writers life.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|Overall, 'Deathly Hallows pt 2' was still one of the better Harry Potter movies. While I know people thought 'part 1' was bleaker, that actually ranked up there as  my favorite. I like part 1 better than part 2.<br /><br />First off - there was nothing at all wrong with the cinematography, the music, the costumes, lighting or acting. I rather enjoyed the music a lot - and said so even two minutes in.<br /><br />All the actors did an excellent job - the \\"kids\\" on up. Daniel Radcliffe did a great job in his last outing (except for one horribly stiff line that took me back to how bad he was in the first two movies), and as much as Rupert Grint and Emma Watson had to do with last movie, their parts seemed diminished with this one. That is understandable considering the story arc.<br /><br />It was great seeing that all the Hogwart students were back this time - if you remember last, there was no school in that movie, however, I liked seeing Neville and Seasmus.  But the adult actors did a great job,  and I'm always a big fan of Alan Rickman's Snape, so I can't complain about his performance. You never can - he always hits it out of the ballpark. Ditto with Maggie Smith. Ralph Finnes did an outstanding job.<br /><br />Don't blink or you'll miss Emma Thompson's four seconds and the guy who played Ron's dad.<br /><br />The movie was really good, but still lacking.  My opinion of course.<br /><br />With all the other movies, I heard people complain about what was missing from the books, which is not unusual for any movie adaptation - and usually those gaps didn't affect me or how I thought the movie turned out. This time, it did.<br /><br />One part was material that was missing. With one sentence - one! - they skipped about 70 pages of the book, all having do do with Dumbledore and his relationship with his family and one Gellert Grindelwald. It was big point in the book about the search for the Deathly Hallows and the grasp for their power. ....and that whole implied gay thing.<br /><br />Neville also mentions the Carrows and needing to watch out for them, and while I saw their names in the credits, I'd almost dare you to pick out which scene they were in.<br /><br />There was another part missing for me as well:  the passion. (and there are spoilers if you have not read the book.)<br /><br />I wasn't looking for gratuitous violence, but all the talk of this being a big battle movie, I did kind of think you'd see the deaths of Fred, Remus and Tonks.  It was all after the fact and barely a blip. Where was the connection to their deaths after having been with Fred for 10 years and the other two for the last few?  A few seconds of film to show Ron's reaction to his brother's death didn't really tie me to that emotion.  I think it was a missed opportunity to put some heart into it all. The director does it (to a degree) with Harry and his parents and Sirius, but they don't really allow it with others.<br /><br />And I wanted and needed more of an exciting demise of Bellatrix LeStrange. Maybe I read the scene with a different sense than was conveyed in the movie.  Her fight scene with Molly Weasley was way underplayed....and done much better on Julie Walter's part than Helena Bonham Carter's. Still, it seemed like playing with their wands as opposed to vengence on either of their parts. Actually, it must have taken Bonham Carter longer to get into make-up than she was in all of this film.  (Side note:  I did enjoy Hermione's voice coming out of her as she tried to portray Bellatrix early in the movie, but there was a flaw with that when going to Gringotts - I'll let you see if you catch it.)<br /><br />Going back to Neville, and again, maybe I read it with a different perspective, but the killing of the snake was just 'meh' here. I remember rereading it several times to make sure that Neville, not Harry, was in some ways the actual hero of the day.<br /><br />The last point was the epilogue. There was a point in the book that described Malfoy at the train station that should have been more poignant. It wasn't.....at least for me. Malfoy was shown for all of 0.04 seconds. The shot conveyed nothing.<br /><br />For all the hoo-hah about having to reshoot that epilogue, my first thought was - 'wow, how bad was the first version?\\"  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't tear inducing or anything.alfoy at the train station that should have been more poignant.

0316017930|4.0|I chose to read this book for my summer reading. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the book because of the subtitle \\"The Story of Success\\". The subtitle had me believing that success was just a one way street and that Outliers was a book on simply how to reach success. After reading Outliers, my view on success and reaching it has transformed. This book has enlightened me on the topic of success; Outliers refutes the typical belief of being \\"largely responsible for our own success\\" as he tells the story of Bill Gates.<br /><br />Gladwell uses Bill Gates story to prove his belief that there is no such thing as a self-made man. When one looks into Bill Gates' upbringing, it is clear that Gates was given the opportunity to succeed when his high school had installed a computer terminal which was rare at the time. Gladwell also included that the year Gates was born had something to do with his success; the fact that Gates was born in a specific time frame gave him the advantage in the computer industry. Gladwell continues stating that \\"The perfect age to be in 1975...is old enough to be a part of the coming revolution but not so old that you missed it. Ideally, you want to be twenty or twenty-one...born in 1954 or 1955.\\" Gates was born in 1955.<br /><br />Another intriguing story that caught my eye was the account of the Avianca flight and how it is commonly used to demonstrate the necessity of communication when flying a plane. More specifically, the necessity of being more direct and clear. The case of First officer Klotz and Captain Caviedes is the epitome of mitigation resulting in harsh consequences. As Gladwell puts it, \\"...Klotz was engaging in...'mitigated speech,' which refers to any attempt to downplay or sugar coat the meaning of what is being said.\\" This section of the book really caught my attention because I am interested in flying planes so this is something I'll keep in mind for my future. Although flying a plane may not seem so similar to running a business or other careers, the concept of adequate communication is highly applicable to any career.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in becoming successful. Outliers has changed my perspective on success for the better.

B008CYDDWI|3.0|One of the more frustrating blu rays that I've ever purchased.<br /><br />I have had the DVD version of the film for a few years, and had gotten the DVD from my collection and was comparing the features listed on the backs of both boxes. I put the blu ray in and settled in to see what kind of improvement in picture and sound quality that the blu ray was going to have.<br /><br />When the film started, I actually had to get up and make sure that I had, in fact, inserted the blu ray into my player, and not my old DVD version. I literally could not tell a difference in quality. This went on for a few minutes, and then the picture became very clear and had a slight improvement in quality...then it went back to DVD quality. I am about 45 minutes into the film and it keeps doing this. It honestly looks like an upscaled DVD in image quality.<br /><br />After only 45 minutes, however, I have seen enough scratches and specks in the film to tell myself that this was not worth upgrading to blu ray from DVD. It doesn't appear that the film was restored or remastered for a blu ray release. The only thing I can really say that I noticed is that it seems to be a bit brighter than the DVD, which isn't necessarily a good thing because it makes the low budget makeup effects stand out more...you can see where the makeup stops and the real flesh begins.<br /><br />The blu ray has nothing additional in the line of extras from the DVD that I already had, and the sound and picture quality are not enough of a difference to warrant an upgrade. If you have the special edition DVD that was released by Anchor Bay, this really is no improvement. If you have the Millennium Edition DVD that was put out prior to the Anchor Bay release, it has features that were not carried over to the blu ray.
B00003CXB6|3.0|The differences between the movie and the book are numerous and objectionable. If you only watch the movie and do not read the book, you will be missing quite a lot. That said, I still believe the movie is worth watching. As far as interest, the book contains the more interesting story, to be sure. While I do like the character of Ian Malcolm overall, given the events of the first movie, there are items with which to take task in this movie. Without revealing anything, I cannot really say any more on this point. The movie gets to the action much quicker than the book. There are plenty of dinosaurs to be found. Some absurd aspects are present. Regardless, I recommend the movie as it is still an exciting and compelling story.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I am over 40 and bought this book because John Green has been on my radar since Looking for Alaska and because I enjoy tuning in to his vlog brothers posts from time to time. The first half of this book was engaging. I liked Hazel's voice and her perspective on living with cancer. She is honest and sarcastic and it seemed real. I've not really read anything from that unusual a perspective before. The whole book is good, but I was more into the first half than the second.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|I love this game and the gameplay so much I wish I could play it every day I like it
B008MG1E4A|1.0|For all the hoppla this book has gotten it is not very informative beyond what you can see/surmise from other sources. While one should never discount the heroism and sacrifice made by those who serve/served this book falls way short of the leaked expectations. Also, just because others revealed information is no reason for him to dishonor those who kept their oaths to not do so.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really keeps me in mind of when I need a charge. Nice looking on the screen too, and customizability allows for a status for whatever tasks you're working on.
0060987464|5.0|The long hard road out of hell gives you a look into the demented mind of Brian Warner and his long hard journey through life to transforming into the controversial Marilyn Manson. Intelligently written and edgy allowing readers to delve into his deepest psyche. Highly entertaining as well as fascinating this book gave me a better understanding of his character. A must read!
B0053KWDES|5.0|After being lied to by a sales rep at a BOSE factory store about the AE2 Headphones on display being amplified (Sales man said they weren't, o yeah they were) I got home with my Motorola Razr Maxx and was super disappointed in the sound output from the AE2 and Razr Combo, I went in search of a Headphone amp. Thinking I was going to have to homebrew one I ran across the Fiio Product line. After some research I decided I would give it a shot. WOW, Best money ever spent on a portable audio product. I highly recommend anyone with a pair of Bose AE2s to get this amp; it really powers these headphones nicely. Very nice sound quality and I'm not even using a EQ setting. I can't hear any clipping and a very comfortable listening level. I plan on connecting this to a signal generator and doing a full electrical review, but I'm very impress at this point.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|I highly recommend this especially if you have a media room with powerful sound.  This DVD took me back to the same concert I witnessed in person 2 years earlier.  Awesome.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best Stephen King novels I've ever read. And I hope people don't run away from it because it's \\"Stephen King\\"--it's not a horror novel. It's just really really good.
B008GX2YQQ|5.0|I need to start by saying I'm an AC fan boy; and I gave it a 5/5 because of that.  But it should be a 4 1/2 or even maybe a 4.  Why?<br />1.  The over filtered vocals take away from the brilliance of Avey and Panda.<br />2.  I love when both Avey and Panda sing together and I was hoping for more of that on this album but not so (Amanita is an exception - they do but the filters on the voices again prevent a clear distinction).<br />3.  and I don't really care for Father time, Monkey riches, and Mercury man... and since I skip these songs, I can't really say that this album is a 5 but at the same time it's not a 4... so round up.<br /><br />I think the biggest thing I get from this album is that it really does a great job of making MPP seem old.  WOW.  Really.  MPP old!<br /><br />So in conclusion AC have moved forward at light speed and have detached themselves from previous work.  I applaud them for that and can't wait for what's coming next.
0525953728|5.0|I, like many Americans, were anxiously awaiting the release of the book yesterday and I finished it this afternoon. I am also a 70% (mainly PTSD) disabled OEF & OIF Veteran (Airborne Infantry) and am so thankful that Mr. Owen published his firsthand account of what happened. People might not like the idea of a Team 6 member disclosing certain aspects of this landmark mission but I am very happy that I now know what exactly took place.<br /><br />However, reading this book was therapeutic for me and provided me with a much broader sense of closure than what was provided to me by the President on the night UBL was taken out. While these guys were on a different planet than I was from a militaristic standpoint, I could feel the anxiety and emotions and could easily relate. So many Americans and families have sacrificed so much and they deserve to know what happened. They need to know that they didn't lose their loved ones in vain. I, myself, needed to know that I didn't lose buddies for nothing. This might not be the book review people might be looking for but for me the book was the single, most important book I have ever read. I am relieved that I now have a picture painted of the raid and that will help me sleep a little better tongight.

030758836X|1.0|I have to say I was loving this book, I could picture it being a great movie. That was until I got to the last section. The ending of this book is so awful, I could think of at least 6 different ways it could have easily went that would have been better!

0857687751|3.0|This is pretty much Hogwarts a History, but about the films. Fans of the movies and films will enjoy this coffee-table worthy book filled with page after page of quotes from the cast and crew, interspersed with fantastic never-before-seen photos of the production process. I feel like you really don't need to be a film buff to enjoy this. There are interviews with major and minor actors, and some crew members I never even knew existed. The thought and work that went in to creating most every seen, and unseen, detail is discussed. It would have been impossible to document each detail in one volume, but this does a fantastic job of covering as much ground as possible.<br /><br />The first portion details the production of each movie, which honestly changed my perspective on some artistic changes and script cuts that were made. I feel like Alfonso Cuaron was finally vindicated in this text. Most every directorial decision was given a chance to argue its point. The next part of the book is broken down to explain in detail the characters, locations, creatures and props that figured prominently in the series. I was really happy with what was provided (from art during the pre-visualization process to the final models), though I'll always wish there was a book dedicated to each and every costume in the series.<br /><br />I highly suggest any fan take a moment to read this at some point, it'll make you notice aspects of the movies you never paid an inch of attention to before.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|The DVD is not long but is great. To hear him sing with so much younger and to hear their comments. Well I've bought 6 of these and everyone given one says the same to me.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Firstly, author, Mark Owen, is a five-star hero.  My three-star rating of the book should not take away from that fact.  This is the only story of the UBL raid as told by someone who was boots-on-ground.  The hype surrounding the pre-release is completely unfounded; there are no politically scathing illuminations or resentment against the \\"establishment\\"  within these pages.<br /><br />Secondly, three-stars is not a bad rating; I recommend this book for people who enjoy reading about the professional life of Navy SEALS, but there are volumes of books written about this subject.  The story of the UBL raid was secondary to the professional story of a post 9/11 Navy SEAL.  In a way, I believe Mark Owen was trying to get that very point across; aside from the immense, historical significance, the mechanics of the UBL raid was essentially like the hundreds of other raids in which he was involved.  Furthermore, Mark Owen acknowledges that many other Navy SEALS were just as qualified to accomplish the mission, but he happened to be in the senior position at the time.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|5 Star read. This book takes me back to the Twin Peaks episodes. Could human kind become 2nd on the food chain?
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Not only was this movie just plain stupid, it was too easy to guess what was about to happen. I didn't connect with any of the characters and the killing was largely useless. Also, the long, drawn out crying bit in the middle had me rolling my eyes.
B004LWZW6U|5.0|I dont think people understand that movies such as this are made to be bad and cheezy which is what makes it so good. I MEAN THEY BROUGHT THE HOFF INTO IT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! AT A WATERPARK! TO BE A LIFE GAURD! I know a lot of people are being so critical because they want to be a critic or whatever. But just know what the people who created the movie were shooting for as an overall product before criticizing. It is a great movie for what they were looking to accomplish. With all that being said, if your looking for a movie that is serious with great acting and an awesome plot and likely to win an academy award, this movie is not for you. If you are someone looking for a good laugh, like movies intentionally made to be cheezy, its a goldmine. All the \\"Critics\\" are just too opinionated.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Saw it four times in the theater, loved it every single time. Buying this and giving it as gifts to anyone that doesn't already own it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read the 'spin'and thought I would try the product - hum... I am now really weary of 'spin' and will definitely 'try before I buy' in future. This is a story or sexual romp through the author's mind following a long and and indepth trip to a sex/porn shop. The storyline is extremely obvious with sexual exploitation as the main theme with a juxtaposing of personalities.<br /> I certainly will not be recommending this book nor reading any follow-up books by this author.
B001FW58D6|4.0|This is how all series should start. It was strong, fast paced and kept me guessing and wanting more. More TV should be like this.
0307887448|5.0|While most of the book revolves around virtual reality and gaming, being a gamer is not a prerequisite for enjoying this book.<br /><br />It's a well-written, engaging story and (I think) almost anyone will enjoy it. Enjoyment levels probably skyrocket for those of us with an appreciation of '80s pop culture, deep web experience, and a penchant for digital gadgetry. The author sprinkles geeky references throughout the book and each one is a delight.<br /><br />The book also includes heavy references to geekery outside of my interests, like anime, Monty Python (blasphemy, I know!), gaming (though I did play a lot of Adventure as a kid), Rush, Dungeons & Dragons, etc. But, *not* having an appreciation for -- or a strong interest in -- those things didn't dampen my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the writer's portrayal of the complex emotional bonds that one can form online, without making them seem exotic or odd. As a person who has formed many such bonds (in fact, I met my husband through my blog many years ago), it was refreshing to see these relationships presented in a relatable, understandable way. If anything, I think the book may help some non-geeks understand how and why some of us enjoy connecting with each other in digital channels in addition to in-person ones.<br /><br />There's also some good social commentary woven throughout, which was insightful, but not too heavy-handed. And his vision of the future? It all felt like something that could happen. And perhaps might.<br /><br />Based on reading the author's acknowledgements, it sounds like a film is already in the works -- which is not at all surprising. As I read it, I can picture the movie (and I'm totally going to buy advance tickets). I have one message for the film studio that takes this on: DON'T MESS IT UP.<br /><br />I had a few minor nitpicks with this book, but they couldn't justify me giving this book any less than 5 stars. Read it!
B0074JODP8|5.0|This concert by Joe Bonamassa cannot be described with words; you're just gonna hafta see and listen. Bonamassa is not an extraordinary blues guitarist, not an extraordinary rock guitarist, not an extraordinary jazz guitarist - he's just extraordinary. He plays and sings the blues in a way that makes you feel it in your gut and in your head, and Joe's surrounded himself with a top-rank trio of musicians who complement and enhance his dynamic performance. Wrapped up in exemplary production, this DVD is superb. So darken the room, don your headphones, keep your eyes open, and press Play...

0452295548|3.0|I admire the author for her courage in facing a devasting illness.  Her stroke could have destroyed her mind and life, but this smart lady and her mother worked on healing her mind.  She had a potential dangerous operation and a slow steady recovery, this smart lady recovers the functions of first her right side of her brain, then eventually the left side of her brain.<br /><br />There is a lot of stuff in this short book that is fluff.  I think the author shows a lot of right side feelings in this book, showing insights that might have meaning to her.  It distracts from the story.  However, this is a story that must be told since strokes are a major illness in our society.<br /><br />I think this is an OK read, and definitely should be read by family of stroke survivors.  It shows that brain damage can heal.

1476712042|4.0|I have read this book several times in the months since I purchased it. I love the story!! I definitely recommend it! It's not exactly realistic, but it's good escapism. It drove me a bit crazy, that even when it wasn't necessarily appropriate, Travis always called Abby by her nickname. Those are such minor things though. I see myself reading this one over and over for years to come.

034580404X|5.0|What can I say? Buying the Trilogy was the best thing I could have done. It was well worth the money and getting the paperbacks was a great value. The quality of the books are nice and I like the size of each book. Easy to handle and comfy on your lap while reading. If you are thinking about reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" then you most definitely should go ahead and purchase the trilogy. You WON'T be disappointed!!! Happy reading!

Seller and Amazon gets a 5 star but the product only gets a 2 star.  The m4 mag pouches are smaller than spec and it was tight getting the Tapco mag out.  You almost don't need the bungee retainer cords.  Mag pouches worked better using metal mags though.  I'm trying to convince myself that this will work but i may have to return this one.

0345525558|4.0|I loved this book. It was so clever how the author used the Victorian flower meanings to tell the story. It made me want to learn what flowers mean. I enjoyed the realness of the characters too.
B0053O89JM|4.0|The main issue I had with season 7 was the same issue I had with the first part of this season. The writers began focusing so much on the stories of the main characters, that they didn't spend time on the cases. Instead, the cases seemed to be an afterthought, just tacked on to keep the long time faithfuls (like myself) on board. Though this season wasn't the train wreck season 4 was, we do get back on track somewhat, as long as you can suspend your belief somewhat.<br /><br />I'll explain that last statement. A doctor has a nervous breakdown, does to prison, and is out on parole. How is it possible to renew your medical license at that point? While still on parole? I understand that the hospital made a deal with the prison, but the American Medical Association wouldn't have allowed that. Not to mention malpractice insurance nightmares. And when House has the new girl on board, she starts actually assisting and doing procedures while not being officially employed by the hospital (which means legally she would have to be a resident or employee and have malpractice insurance). But the series has never really been authentic in those aspects, though the cases tend to be more realistic, and often based on real life medical facts. The space age lung machine? It's real. Though it's a dome shape, not square. I guess they had to do square to keep from having the film crew reflected in the dome.<br /><br />The first two episodes are tortuous for a long time House fan. They tend to be off in the more 'mainstream' drama realm. Hugh Laurie even seems to be phoning it in during these first couple. And once House is practicing again, we see the constant threat of 'go back to jail'. It gets kind of off putting. Once he loses the ankle bracelet I wanted to scream with relief. But even then we still get Foreman and others threatening House every 10 minutes or so.<br /><br />Taub gets more interesting in this season, which is great since I've always kind of liked him. We also get two new doctors, one annoys me nonstop (Adams - not a good replacement for Olivia Wilde - sorry), the other is more realistic as a doctor (Park - aka Bookie Monster - you'll see). There is an incident with Chase about midway through, and I was really kind of put off by that story arc (again going with the more mainstream drama events). It never quite gets melodramatic though. Not Gray's Anatomy area anyway.<br /><br />It's fitting end to the series, and though it has it's ups and downs, it still resembles the show it started as, which is uncommon nowadays. Though seasons 1 - 3 were rock solid, seasons 5 - 8 have been good, though not without their ups and downs. This series is still more realistic in the medical cases than ER was or Gray's Anatomy.<br /><br />Understandably shows tend to get more involved with their characters as the series progresses. It is the only reason I find seasons 1 -3 better than the rest. Still great drama, but just a little too much personal 'drama' in later seasons.<br /><br />Oh, and the constant Ford promos get very irritating. When a character says \\"Hey, don't take these corners that fast\\" and the other answers \\"It's okay with this car's new something something handling system,\\" yeah, it's lame. Or the zoom in on the dashboard of Wilson's Ford. And always a big shot of the Ford logo. These scenes are unnecessary and actually serve to put a big brake on the flow. So much that each time I was tempted to turn off the show.<br /><br />----<br /><br />There are a few nice special features at the end of the series worth watching. There is a little video montage by Laurie which is quite fun.new doctors, one annoys me nonstop (Adams - not a good replacement for Olivia Wilde - sorry), the other is more realistic as a doctor (Park - aka Bookie Monster - you'll see).

0525953728|5.0|Most books written by former SEALS tend to be written by men full of themselves, promoting themselves. The author of \\"No Easy Day\\" is a welcome change. He is modest. He credits his teammates with as much or more than he credits himself. You sense the team is just that, a team. And it's not about one person but the team. The author has been ostracized by his teammates and the military. Team Six and other special ops have a code of silence, which the author broke. So he wrote this book at great personal risk and at great personal cost. Of course, he's not the first SEAL to write a book about his service.<br /><br />Unlike other SEALS I've read, this man actually credits a woman with much of the success of this special mission. She is a woman who has worked on it for ten years right down to the smallest detail. The author says she put in all the years of work and the SEALS just carried out the mission -- finished the job. Few men, especially SEALS, would give a woman credit for anything of that nature.<br /><br />Of course, in truth, it takes more than a small group to accomplish a mission like this. It takes people working behind the scenes using intelligence. But aside from all that, the story told in the pages of this book is a gripping story and you know going in that it's THE true story. This is the man who was at the front of the charge. He is the one who took the all-important photos and one of the men who took the DNA.<br /><br />The author tells us that Bin Laden was a coward. He had two guns. And yet, we read, \\"They were both empty. He hadn't even prepared a defense. He had no intention of fighting. He asked his followers for decades to wear suicide vests or fly planes into buildings, but didn't even pick up his weapon. In all of my deployments, we routinely saw this phenomenon.

0062060562|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. To its credit, I did find myself looking forward to reading it and foregoing sleep in order to find out what would happen next. But this was despite the fact that I found myself kind of hating it, hoping that the story would redeem itself in the end, which it did not. First, the idea is not original (See: \\"Memento\\" and \\"50 First Dates\\") and proceeds to become less and less plausible as this woman with a horrific brain injury suddenly starts remembering things decades after her accident just because she's writing in a journal. I call shenanigans. If her memory is so damaged, writing in a journal wouldn't make such a drastic difference, especially not so many years later. And the \\"twist\\" is predictable, uninteresting, and doesn't even make much sense. Worst of all is the writing. For some reason, I got the impression that the author was actually trying really hard to be poetic and thought he was succeeding when, in fact, the writing was bland and even, at times, annoying. I don't understand how a mediocre book could garner such glowing reviews. In my opinion, the only truly positive quality this book possesses is the inherent mystery, but even that turns out to be unsatisfying.
B007QJBJ76|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie because it is a John Carpenter film. I was very surprised to read such rave reviews of it because I found it to be dull.<br /><br />Nothing interesting, suspenseful or scary happened by 36 minutes in; still nothing 51 minutes in. Sixteen minutes away from the end of the movie: these scenes somewhat held my interest, but I attribute this to 1) it was the middle of the night when nothing else was on and 2) I wanted some sort of validation that I hadn't wasted the past hour plus of my time.<br /><br />I gave the film 2 stars instead of 1 because of the cast - both Jamie Lee Curtis and another Halloween (78) cast member star in this, as well as two cast members from the classic Creepshow movies PLUS Janet Lee. I suppose for the 80's, this movie has a leg up on other 80's movies in most genres of its time. The plot itself isn't horrible, but it could have executed better...and in a lot less time!<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a suspenseful/scary movie - I recommend 'Halloween,' 'The Orphanage,' and 'Paranormal Activity 2'.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The author is an unintentional genius.  Seriously.  Don't we all wish we thought of it?  Slap together a repetitive, boring story about an insecure girl who tries to have a backbone and a male lead that is straight out of every cliche ever - with a modern twist that requires sexual deviation of some kind -  and Voila!  Super success and a now rich E.L. James.  Magic combination?  Gullible readers?  Manipulation by the publishing world?  The disintegration of higher literary expectations or the result of a sub-par high school English curriculum?  I don't know.  I don't understand why this story has taken off.  I really don't.<br /><br />This book was: Really really repetitive and the occasional use of a thesaurus was obvious and awkward.  Author attempts to write kinky sex but didn't really go outside the box much.  The author thinks readers are obtuse, just as thickheaded as can be.  So she hits us over the head with her theme.  Hard.  No perception is necessary by the reader.  No inference expected.  But just in case you don't understand her in-your-face theme - Mr. Grey has gray eyes and he's all sorts of Fifty Shades of gray.<br /><br />And Ana and Christian, our insubstantial characters?  Well.  Ana's 21.  A college grad.  But never had an orgasm and is a virgin.  She will orgasm repeatedly throughout the book.  Of course, she's also very attractive but doesn't know it, has guys flocking to her and never gets it.  And she's a klutz who says what she doesn't think and thinks what she won't say.  Christian's 26.  A billionaire.  A concert pianist.  He's a regular dark Adonis who charms everyone.  But, poor guy was adopted at age 4 into a super wealthy family.  And suffered somehow, mysteriously and won't speak of it in any details.  So, yes, he's rich, beautiful, talented and mysterious, sad and messed up (I suspect his painful past is as cliche as he is).  Enter BDSM.<br /><br />And Ana, the fool, though she calls him a stalker and lets him \\"punish\\" her for silly, petty things like eye rolling, doesn't get \\"it\\" until he literally beats her with a belt.  Then she finally shows some grit and leaves him.  But since there's two more books in the series, I'll say she runs right back to him before too long.<br /><br />If you are undecided, don't feel pressured into reading it.  It may hold some guilty entertainment value but it won't be worth what you put into it.  If you really want to know what all the hoopla's about anyway, I recommend borrowing it instead of buying.  And if you read through some of the reviews you will note the occasional reference to and comparison with Twilight.  It hurts me to say it, but Twilight is better, the author even more of a successful genius, too.  Maybe that will help you decide.

B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This little app is terrific. The concept of having different colored notebooks that you title and keep your lists or concepts in, is ingenious.  The normal \\"notes\\" apps work ok for me but I truly appreciate being able to approach things long term in a mini volume so to speak .... because it has not stood the test of time, (have not had it that long) I can't mark it higher, but otherwise it is a great app. There are probably different types, but my Android version works fine.

B00340ESIS|4.0|Save the Cat was recommended to me over a year ago by a friend who had read my book and thought it would be a great screenplay. Given that STC is a classic must-read in the script writing genre, he thought it might inspire me to rework mine for the big screen. Little did he know that his recommendation would have me on the verge of tears. Forget script writing, this book is a must read for writers period. By the end of the first chapter I could see pretty much every fatal flaw in the the novel I'm currently working on. By the end of the third chapter, I'd identified a few more and was reading while lying in the foetal position, sobbing quietly. Fortunately from there on in things started to pick up. Yes I could see what was wrong, but I could also see how to fix it.<br /><br />This is a great read for writers, and for movie goers who have an interest in deconstructing films. Interested to know what Point Break and Fast Five have in common? (Hint: They're exactly the same movie just with cars instead of surfboards) then this is the book for you. Oh and if you liked The Avengers, you should read this book and find out why!
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book and its portrayal of Nick and Amy's marriage.  Without giving anything away, the villain in this book is incredible.  Others seem to have a problem with the ending, but I thought it was great -- very thought provoking and not what I had been expecting.  This was a wonderful read.
B004LROMWU|3.0|This series shows a great deal of promise, the ideas and setting are excellent as are the creature designs. My only gripe is with character development or rather, lack thereof. The lead experiences little to no real personal growth for over 9 episodes, nor does the female lead. They might have an emotional outburst, but it doesn't -change- anything about the way they behave later (see House for a great example of how people change because of events). Philosophical and emotional speeches abound, and in most cases the main characters tend to be absorbed into the community minded fluffiness that might make for a great group of people to live in, but not a great show to watch as it feels very dated. I found myself walking away from the screen to do stuff around the house because there was frequently very little tension, and I didn't particularly care about anyone. With the exception of (SPOILER) the son who had been harnessed by the aliens and was struggling with the changes he was experiencing (very well acted too).
0553801473|2.0|I wasn't more than forty pages into this latest failure of GRMM,s, when I realised how repetitive and lacking of story advancement it was. It is so full of loose ends, a professional seamstress could tie them up. Martins problem is he no longer controls the story, the story is controlling him. He appears to be writing whatever garbage pops into his head, to fill pages and hopefully find a conclusion, one where he can pick it up for the continuance, \\"Winds\\".<br />I'd like to know if the timeleine of \\"The Winds of Winter\\", will be before Dance with Dragons, because in the main part of the book, DWD, a raven arrives from Lord Ramsey, advising that Stannis and his army have been wiped out, but in the first pages of Winds, we have Stannis back planning his attack on Winterfell. If a boring book that you can skip every second line interests you, buy it, otherwise give it a BIG miss. Everything that needed to be said in the storyline, was said in the first three books.<br />Will I buy \\"Winds\\", no way, I might venture to the libary and take it out, just to see if he can put an end to this horrific saga.<br />I awarded it two stars on the basis, one for content and story, and one for length. 1099 pages plus the epilogue a total of 1117, a mammoth effort of writing in circles.
0345803485|1.0|Had to force myself to finish reading this book only because I paid the $10 for it.  What an idiot I am.  I am really not sure what everyone who drools over this book gets all excited about.  I am actually very curious as to what other authors/books these fans read, it sure as heck can't be anything that I enjoy!  (No offense)  It sounds like what a 16yo would write if she imagined BDSM.  There are a lot better erotica writers out there...that know how to write.

B006Y9BVRM|4.0|I wanted a solar quartz watch because I got tired of my worthless high-end automatics.  I have a stainless Daytona, an Explorer II, among others.  My father always liked Seiko when I was a kid, so I got this watch.  It is big and bulky and I didn't care for the band at all, so I replaced it.  It works great, and I think it's good looking.  I'm very pleased with the watch.  I does everything my Daytona does, and also has the date which my Daytona doesn't.  I bought this watch at the same time I got a white ceramic technoMarine for my wife.  Now that watch blows my Seiko, and my Rolexes, out of the water, so my enthusiasm for this watch has been tempered because of jealousy.

1452110581|5.0|I puchased this book for my wife who adores all cats. Ok, I also purchased it because I adore the four cats that enrich our lives by just being around. We receieved it yesterday, hunkered down on the couch last night, and read the poems aloud to one another. It was truly delightful, we laughed and laughed. We tried to figure out which of our four would have been most likely to pen each particular entry.If you live cats, this book is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Also the book arrived before promised and very well packaged. Good deal all around.

0525953728|1.0|Those of us who have had the honor of serving this fine country in the Special Operations community understand the need for secrecy. Any former operator that publishes details of covert, classified or special operations missions is a square one sell out. A self serving individual counting his ill begotten monetary gains, does so on the graves of the true heros. Any person that puts his own needs over those of his Brothers and Sisters in arms, has shamed himself and the fine memory of the fallen, past present and future. There is no pressing need to know, other than the fact that Osama Bin Laden is dead. The many un-named units involved in Neptune Spear have not contacted Hollywood and retained a publisher to glorify themselves. Fortunately, none of those personel have broken the honor code, the NDA's they signed, security clearance be damned, and put it in writting for the sake of a cheap buck. To \\"Mr. Owen\\": there is NO EASY WAY to get ahead in life, but honesty and hard work. You have taken a short cut that will lead you nowhere. Honor must be earned, but is not guaranteed by future actions. Your's is now gone. Forever.

B003102JDM|3.0|I've always said that The Coen Brothers were hit or miss with me.  They have some films that I absolutely adore and then there are a few that just leave me scratching my head.  The cult status for `A Serious Man' is one that leaves me, well, a tad dumfounded.  I don't really see the massive appeal, despite actually really liking a few aspects of the film (namely, Michael Stuhlbarg's tremendous performance).<br /><br />The film opens with a Jewish family killing a ghost and then moves right into a Jewish professor in 1967 Minnesota struggling with a slew of familial problems.  Yeah, I'm still trying to understand the point of the film's opening.  From there we learn of Professor Gopnik's wife's infidelity, his son's weed usage and his daughter's intentions for a nose job.  We learn of his brother's annoyance on others and the fact that he has not only a gambling problem but certain questionable activities.  We learn of his neighbor's apparent racism and their feud over land and we learn of his moral objections over a student's bribe.  All of this is well and fine except that Gopnik is such a push over that he's completely walked all over by everyone in his life to the point of paying for the funeral of his wife's lover.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />I'm not saying that `A Serious Man' is a bad film, because it isn't, but it isn't a great one either.  If just doesn't say much, in my opinion, and the writing seems almost lazy in some respects, which may have actually been the intention.  The ambiguousness of the film's open and close (both of which seem a tad disjointed, the opening more than a tad actually) also hurt the film's overall appeal because it feels uneven and unfocused.  I'm not really quite sure WHAT the Coens wanted to say, so I'm not sure the film says anything at all.<br /><br />That being said, Michael Stuhlbarg commands with a perfected frazzling of his nerves and delivers a performance that I was not expecting.  He understands the black comedy aspects of the film and delivers in spades.  Outside of Stuhlbarg though, this film just doesn't stack up.ects of the film and delivers in spades.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay is the last of a trilogy. It, as the two other novels in the trilogy, is an easy read and is a \\"page turner\\".

B003QTSMXE|5.0|WALL-E is By far one of my favorite Disney-Pixar movies EVER. I remember loving disney movies as a child and now i can love them as a young adult because of movies like this.<br /><br />The Beginning Shows a Very cute little robot doing what he was Intended for, cleaning our garbage consumed planet. as the movie goes on you come to see WALL-E is the only Robot that has survived and has adapted a very smart intelect. The simplicity of his innocence is prominent throughout the entire movie. HIs best friend is a cockaroach and he lives in an old machine that is decorated with his personality. Lights, Toys and various memrobelia that he himself finds simple when in reaity are some of the most history changing things like rubics cubes and video games.<br /><br />A look into his daily routine shows he is just like the rest of us, wakes up sleepy and gets ready for the day. which is absolutly adorable.<br /><br />The graphics are a 10, stunning color and animation steal he show. The movie also has a bigger meaning. Like taking care of our planet, eating healthy and going back to our roots as people before fast food and takeout existed.<br /><br />WALL-E is an amazin movie for kids and adults of all kind and touches a spot on your heart that no other disney movie has ever achived. You just want to take wall-e home with you.<br /><br />This is definitly a movie to buy on dvd and keep forever.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a naturalized American citizen who has resided in New York City for over two dozen years including 9/11 and its aftermath, as someone who attended high school mere blocks from the World Trade Center and lost a high school classmate when those towers came tumbling down, I bought No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden mainly to read an eyewitness account of how the mission to kill Bin Laden was successfully accomplished.<br /><br />When I started reading this ebook, however, I realized that the author, pen named Mark Owen, offers a lot more in his book than what the title suggests.  He prefaces his book by stating his desire that his book will inspire a young reader to follow in the author's footstep to become a Navy SEAL, as the author was so similarly inspired a lifetime ago.  Indeed, Mark Owen offers an honest and unvarnished look at the lifestyle of a member of the armed forces, the intense training and the personal sacrifices involved, and the rewards including personal satisfaction of service to our nation.  No Easy Day provides the kind of information that our kids should have before deciding whether or not to enlist for military service, and should be considered a valuable resource in that regard.<br /><br />Furthermore, the death of Osama Bin Laden is a major event in the modern day history of America, and therefore No Easy Day would make a wonderful reading assignment for an American history course in high school or college.<br /><br />Finally, No Easy Day provides a fresh perspective of the events leading up to and including the execution of the mission to hunt for Osama Bin Laden, regardless of the motive of the author in writing this book.  The stories of courage and patriotism and dedication of the men and women who were involved in this mission, as found within the pages of No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama Bin Laden, provide inspiration to the American public at large.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|When I accidently stumbled on this book earlier in the year I was rather skeptical, however the reviewers had given it a solid write up and it just seemed to make sense. What sold me on it was being able to grab \\"Muscle Myths\\" by the same author for free and realizing that Bigger Leaner Stronger was going to be awesome.<br /><br />First off, I am in my late 40s and have been overweight since about 18 years old. I have never been overly fit and in recent years things became bad. February 2012 I was tipping the scales at 255lbs and staring down the barrel of a 42\\" pair of jeans. I started following the program in March and haven't looked back.<br /><br />Here we are in September 2012 and I am fitting easily into 36\\" jeans and with 35lbs of weight lost. I'm fitter, healthier and with better muscle definition than in my entire life and I am easily stronger than I've been in 20+ years. Not only that my Suit Jacket fitting has dropped from 46 to 44 (a real surprise) and I sleep better with more energy than before.<br /><br />What I like about this book:<br />The author doesn't insist you buy a ton of supplements or Ugandan Bull Shark Testosterone (I am well aware Uganda is land-locked, this is an attempt at humor. Mock now and repent at your leisure). In fact only a couple of supplements are discussed and no specific vendor or purveyor is mentioned.<br /><br />Almost all the exercises can be done at home, no need to sign up for Platinum Gym, Ultra-Diamond 5 year commitment package with personal trainer. Unless you happen to have a gym membership of some description or working out at home is not possible in which case, knock yourself out.<br /><br />It works!<br /><br />The first part of the book is crucial as it deals with ensuring that the Author and the reader have a common frame of reference for everything. It's a review piece for some, but for me it really helped me understand what I should be eating, when and (very important this) why.<br /><br />What I will say before getting to grips with getting on the program: GO GET A PHYSICAL! Guys, if you are squeamish about going to the Doctor and can't see why you would get checked out, get over yourselves and just go; it will be worth the effort.<br /><br />Getting a physical means you get your weight, blood pressure, blood work etc. mapped out before you start and thereby you know, precisely, where you WERE before you started.<br /><br />It also means you get a chance for any underlying health issues taken care of (I had a lump in foot removed that I didn't even know could be a problem!) and it also means when you go back for your yearly physical you'll have absolute proof things are improving.<br /><br />This program does not require huge amounts of time but is NOT something that is 5 minutes a day either. There will be some sacrifice and you will have to carve out some time in your day, but it is also not onerous.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor; get this book. Read it, understand it and internalize what foods work and what foods don't and, critically, WHY they don't work.re getting to grips with getting on the program: GO GET A PHYSICAL!

B005FITIGO|3.0|Before I saw this movie, I thought it had a lot going for it. Being about the financial crisis of 2008, it sounded like it would have a good story, a good plot. It had a strong cast of actors - Stanley Tucci, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany.<br /><br />After watching the movie, I felt it still had a strong cast of actors. But the story was a bit of a letdown. At the end of the movie, I sat there for a good five minutes trying to figure out how exactly I felt about this movie. It started out strong and fast-paced - it had me hooked into the story. Then about halfway through, it just seemed to fall apart. The pace slowed down, and the story became bland and kind of dull. It felt muddled with all the characters in there. And Penn Badgley's character seemed kind of pointless. His character showed the idealistic, naive kid who wanted to work in the financial market all his life. But really, it just felt like one character too many for the story. By no means was this a terrible movie - I liked it despite its flaws. But it's not the best movie out there either.

I watched this film many years ago before I'd even seen Baz's R&J, and to be honest I thought I'd hate it - I just couldn't be bothered to turn the TV off (sad but true). However, itt soon had me in its grasp and it's one of my favourite films, and more than worthy of comparison with Baz's later offerings, much as I love MR in particular.<br /><br />The only reason I would give this film less than 5 stars (which I couldn't possibly bring myself to do anyway!!) would be the DVD extras. The behind the scenes documentary is informative, but unfortunately narrated by an unbearably cheesy American voice such as you get on the very worst tackiest film trailers - painful! And aside from that there's not a huge amount on offer. It's almost worth the cringe-worthy voice, though, to see Baz looking decidedly young and whipper-snapper-ish... any Baz fans will be amused! It's a shame that the film originally came out before DVDs and extras were a consideration - they seem to be cobbled together somewhat.<br /><br />All in all - worth getting on DVD for the sound and picture quality, especially in this music-driven colourful film, but Baz should be ashamed to have let a film of his go out with less than excellent extras.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Big Big Train have been around since 1990 playing their own brand of very English Progressive Rock.  The current line-up, consisting of Nick D'Virgilio, Dave Gregory, David Longdon, Andy Poole and Gregory Spawton are producing the best material of this lengthy career and, in my opinion, the some of the best music in the Prog scene as a whole.  I would even go as far as to say that this album and the last one (The Underfall Yard) are two of the best Progressive Rock albums released in the last few decades!<br /><br />...like all great albums \\"English Electric Part 1\\" takes a few listens to fully appreciate, but every track on the album has that rare combination of instant appeal and depth to draw you in and repay multiple listens;  Each replay is a delight of discovery as the true majesty of the music and the storytelling in the lyrics unfolds before your ears.<br /><br />Big Big Train are masters of their art; they have incredible song-writing ability, musicianship, attention to detail and depth, astonishing production (well done Mr Rob Aubrey) ...and the lyrics and vocal delivery are just sublime.<br /><br />The choice of subject matter and instrumentation makes the listening experience a walk back in time through the English countryside.  Pastoral vistas unfold, we hear of suffering in the harshest of working conditions contrasted with the simple pleasures of the countryside, eccentric artists hoodwinking the best in the business, tales of pioneering exploits pushing the boundaries of human endeavour.  It's gripping stuff; the kind of song writing that delivers spine chills by the bucket load and compels the listener to learn more about the subjects.<br /><br />To give the uninitiated some idea of what BBT sound like; it would be easy and somewhat valid to draw parallels with early Genesis, but that would, in all honesty, be under-selling Big Big Train.  They have captured that quintessential English Prog sound, made it their own whilst, at the same time, injecting a fresh vibrancy to it so that it's relevant in the 21st century.  No mean achievement!<br /><br />2012 has been a great year for music and BBT have been up against some stiff competition but in my book there's only one contender for album of the year and this is it.  I look forward to playing this album a lot more and am already anticipating the follow-up \\"English Electric Part 2\\" in 2013.
B0014DQSGW|1.0|You would think that a romcom with Bullock and Grant could hardly go wrong.<br /><br />Unfortunately it does in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />Zero chemistry is never a good start in a romantic movie, and two very funny people are let down by an unfunny script.<br /><br />The film feels like it never quite starts - I spent the whole thing waiting for the story to kick in - and then it's over.<br /><br />Very disappointing. I expect the commentary and bloopers are the best reason (if there is a reason!) to buy this movie.<br /><br />Just plain boring - what a shame.

As others mention, this book inherits the principles outlined by Eric Ries, Steve Blank, and the Business Model Canvas. Great synthesis and expansion of the source materials and a solid contribution on top of that.

B003Y3AZSW|4.0|If you're looking at this chopping board set, then you already know that it's a good idea to keep separate boards for the type of stuff you chop. Avoid cross-contamination in the kitchen!    The Good:    So neat and organized! The build quality of the set is pretty nice. The stand is sturdy and stable, and the cutting boards and their tabs are solid. Being dishwasher safe is convenient. The cutting boards themselves are a relatively soft plastic that is easy to scratch and cut, which isn't really a bad thing at all (contrary to reviews I've seen on other boards). On a cutting board, the board is supposed to protect your knife by being soft and giving under pressure, which means your knife's edge stays sharp instead of dulling (that's why glass cutting boards are absolutely terrible for your knives).    The Bad:    This set is a bit pricey. Some people also don't like the look of scratched and gouged cutting boards, and while it is indeed unattractive, it isn't necessarily a bad thing, as I've mentioned earlier. The biggest gripe I have is that these boards are a bit small, measuring 13.25\\" x 9.25\\" each.    I hope Joseph Joseph makes  a bigger version in the future, but aside from that, it's not a bad set of cutting boards.

0786186291|5.0|I got these books to help me get through 2.5 hours of daily commuting to and from a new job. I was somewhat low in my spirits and wanted a distraction from the tedium of work.<br /><br />I bought the Simon Vance audio version of book, and played it in my car on the way to work.<br /><br />While at first, I struggled - and indeed, for the first book, I played each CD twice so as to fully understand what was going on, I got used to the narrative style and learned the vocabulary. At first, it is somewhat akin to the nadsat in A Clockwork Orange. Once you understand the terms, however, the very detailed technical descriptions of sailing become second nature.<br /><br /> I never thought that these books would impact me the way that they have. They are a stunning illustration of a time period that I think is best described by Richard Snow, in his  description of the series:<br /><br />\\" But begin with the first of them, \\"Master and Commander,\\" and there's a good chance you'll find yourself at the final installment all too soon. You will have read what I continue to believe are the best historical novels ever written. Along the way you'll not only have witnessed the unfolding of a tremendous story, but the very beginnings of the world we inhabit. In one of the books Maturin nearly propounds a theory of Freudian psychology; in another he falls just shy of the immense implications of evolution. His is the kind of questing mind that made the late 18th century such an age of revelation; his counterpart Jack Aubrey personifies the raw energy that fueled the epoch. On every page O'Brian reminds us with subtle artistry of the most important of all historical lessons: that times change but people don't, that the griefs and follies and victories of the men and women who were here before us are in fact the maps of our own lives. \\" ([...])<br /><br />These books are really something special. I finished all 21 without a pause, buying each to make sure I got it before my current book was out. Once you get into the time period and O'Brien's narrative voice, tales are gripping, characters and plots slowly unfold, and each book is as much world-building as it is plot-building, and it is a world that is somehow familiar - we still carry vestigial  cultural markers of that time to the present day - from language to etiquette. O'Brien truly makes that time come to life in a way that is compelling, gripping, never idolized, and builds complex characters that one truly cares for.<br /><br />Simon Vance does an outstanding job narrating, with every accent spot-on, from  bitter old admirals to young midshipmen to the different women who reoccur in the novels.  His voice is clear, and his flow and intonation are perfect - driven without being satirically theatrical.<br />These will likely be some of the best fictional novels you have read - and sometimes the line between fiction and history is blurred to indistinction, which only adds to the depth of realism. I wholeheartedly recommend these books, and while they may be hard to get into at first, the time spent acclimating to them is well worth it.<br /><br />As a side note: I often find myself unconsciously using figures of speech and mannerisms from the book in everyday speech, which is amusing.d and O'Brien's narrative voice, tales are gripping, characters and plots slowly unfold, and each book is as much world-building as it is plot-building, and it is a world that is somehow familiar - we still carry vestigial  cultural markers of that time to the present day - from language to etiquette.

0425263908|3.0|If you're looking for a replacement for 50 Shades of Grey and/or want something that will make you blush even more, this is your best bet! Bared to You is a story about Eva Tramell, a recent college graduate who is trying to make it on her own in New York City despite the over-protection of her mother, the trophy-wife of a billionaire. Eva has some serious baggage {of which I won't spoil for you} and so does Gideon Cross, the billionaire who owns the building Eva works in. From the moment Gideon meets Eva he is fascinated by the emotions he feels for her. This book {the first in the Crossfire trilogy} chronicles the difficulties Gideon and Eva face as two emotionally damaged individuals working to create a healthy relationship.<br /><br />If Sylvia Day was not inspired by 50 Shades of Grey and Bared to You is a completely original idea, I feel really bad for her for publishing this book too late; the similarities between the two books are uncanny but Day proves to be a much more proficient writer. Her prose is more articulate and succinct than the amateurish 50 Shades trilogy. Furthermore, Day's writing will have you blushing even if you're preconditioned to the erotic scenes in The Red Room. While there's no BDSM per se, your jaw will drop more than once while reading what Gideon says and does; this book is not for the faint of heart {you have been warned!}.<br /><br />I admit to feeling a little \\"above\\" these books in that I think the story line is so cheesy and superficial; I totally judge myself for the enjoyment I get out of the romance{I feel like I need to say that to justify talking so seriously about it! lol}. That said, I really appreciate that this book had more depth than 50 Shades of Grey in that Eva was a protagonist that I could really get behind. Eva is smart and beautiful, but she works for much of what she has and doesn't take advantage of the opportunities she is given. Most importantly, she is emotionally damaged but doesn't let her past controlher; she works hard through her therapy to free herself as best she can. Even with her therapy Eva isn't perfect; she admits to being insecure, jealous and in need of control. When the going gets tough, Eva flees {something I relate to which made me appreciate her more}. The layers of Eva make the book more intriguing than if she was a plain, innocent, white canvas for Gideon to obsess over. Instead she is realistic, colorful and relatable to readers.<br /><br />Gideon is also an interesting and multifaceted character. While this book doesn't uncover the depths of his past, the layers that are slowly revealed make him just as entertaining as Eva, if not more so. In comparison to 50 Shades of Grey, Gideon resembles Christian more closely than Eva resembles Ana, but Gideon is a little more rough around the edges than Grey, seemingly less polished in managing his emotions. I didn't \\"fall in love\\" with Gideon the way I did with Christian, but it may be in part because I've only read 1/3 of the series {book 2 comes out in October, book 3 in December}<br /><br />While the story is more succinct than 50 Shades of Grey, there is still very little climax in the storyline {insert climax joke here} because so much time is spent back and forth with Eva and Gideon chasing each other in circles trying to figure out if and how their relationship can work. To some this may be too dull of a read, but if you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey{which hardly had a captivating storyline between 3 books}, you'll be just as pleased with this book. If the writing and characters are any indication, I think we have a lot to look forward to in the sequels that will be released later this year. I am anxious to see what darkness haunts Gideon's past and if Eva is prepared to face it.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you loved 50 Shades of Grey, you will love this one. You might start off with a grudge {Team Grey vs Team Cross!}, but after a few chapters it will stop feeling like a 50 Shades repeat. Although ifthe erotic scenes in 50 Shades were too much for you, you may want to pass. ★★★/5

B000ICLRIE|5.0|First off let me say that I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan, I have been since I was a kid growing up with the likes of Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise and so on, and I first purchased the normal DVD of this which is of course the theatrical cut, I couldn't even make it through the whole movie, it felt rushed and incomplete, I was left very disappointed, and for the first time I was disappointed with Ridley Scott, but later learning that it wasn't his fault, it was Hollywood taking and pretty much ruining the movie, because they felt it ran too long, and they butchered it, had this been the cut that made the theatres and home video releases first, this film might have won academy awards.<br /><br />First off, the acting is superb, everybody gives great performances, that wasn't the problem with the theatrical cut anyways, the score is also excellent and perfectly fits the movie, the set design and special effects are outstanding, and if you watch the documentaries, you will see that there was not a lot of CGI in this movie, very little at best, they actually built a lot of those structers and filmed on locations in spain, and last but not least, the story, which is where this directors cut really shines of course, right off you will see scenes that were not in the theatrical cut, and the additional footage just grabs you, unlike the theatrical cut, I got bored about halfway through the theatrical cut, this one, I did not want it to end, it was just so well done, and shame on Hollywood for taking an epic of this scale, and butchering it because of running time, anyone who is interested in this time in history wouldn't mind sitting in a theatre for another hour, especially if the additional scenes really benefit the film, and they so do.<br /><br />So bottom line, if you saw the theatrical cut of this movie, and felt disappointed like I did, you absolutely NEED to check this version out, they are completely different movies, like apples and oranges, now I just got into the whole blu-ray thing, because I just bought a player this month, and now I see why everybody is so crazy about this format, the picture is just so crisp and clear and detailed, the sound is so much more enhanced, not taking anything away from DVD, they are still a great format, but this is what it's all about, and this movie looks FANTASTIC in blu-ray, the costumes jump right out, especially the lepers mask, the sets and structers look like you're really there, and the sound like I said is just so superior, if you have a blu-ray player, and wanted to like this movie the first time and didn't, do yourself a favor, and buy this version, you'll see a completely different movie.

B0015RFCZ0|3.0|This is the story of an attractive young couple, both of whom were musically gifted. They meet,make love, part, and unknown to the guy, a boy is born. He is born into a world without a mom or dad. He, too, is musically talented, and blows away adults with his advanced skills on the organ, guitar, etc. He seems to find friends and adults who help him develop and showcase his musical gifts. When he is called upon, at about the age of eleven, to direct a symphony orchestra in Central Park in New York, his parents, as though drawn by ocean tides, appear to celebrate some very, very special new beginnings! I have given a number of these to people who love music, in one case to a high school band director. For my wife and me, we watch it about every year. . . in August!

Kept it on the list though ~ Sandra Bullock & Tom Hanks.  Had to be good.  Though the subject matter (9/11) could have made this a 'heavy' film, the story that prevailed was anything but.  The tragedy of 9/11 was not lost in the story, but this is not another dramatic reenactment.  It's a story of healing, growth and determination.  Lessons we can all benefit from.

B0083Z614S|4.0|I had children in my reading group read this story and discuss it.  Everyone found it interesting (though our books varied - some had the original language of the area while some were in more modern language) and we all enjoyed seeing characters change because of someone's influence in their life.  Just goes to show that one person DOES have a huge impact, whether you believe it or not.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|My wife and I went to see this movie the first week it was out.  My wife is not into sci-fi or fantasy but liked this movie.  We saw it in 3D at a theatre in an adjoining state since we don't have any in our area and that theatre in MD was actually the closest to us.  I preordered the 3D Blu-Ray set from Amazon and paid less than $3 because I had accumulated points from my Amazon Visa card.  My brother also saw the film (from my dvd on his Blu-Ray player) and liked it. A really great film!

B008602KQI|5.0|My daughter couldn't wait to own \\"The Hunger Games\\" movie.  She read the books multiple times and saw the movie in the theater.  This movie is an excellent adaptation of a complicated book with an extremely dark theme.  I read the books myself several months before watching the movie (at home) and must say that many of the finer points in the movie would be lost on a person who hadn't read the books.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|first of all. great game. very addictive and time consuming. yes the friends bug is a pain n the but but you can still enjoy it without it. second of all. this is a kindle. learn to read. there is a warning in the game description. and besides. there are security features you can set up to prevent purchases inside apps.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This has been the best game I have ever purchased ! Once I start playing I can't stop, just like good candy anytime.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I really liked this book from the first page.  Its a fantasy I can imagine me doing sometime; not necessarily to heal someone--other than myself, but just to spend the time with myself.  Kind of like a modern Canterbury Tales, if I remember right.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is so funny! My kids have seen it many times and never get tired of it!I would recommend it to anyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so addicting, and this app is easy to use. You can spend hours looking through all the great things they have on here.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. It converted the movie well into a game and has Huge free roam areas that you can ride the bat pod and the bat. Great fighting style (very realistic). The only problem I have would be that the camera angle is pointed down and Way too close to batman, especially when trying to fight. I was struggling to move the camera and it was very distracting. This game is great if you like the Metal Gear games or just love batman. Also, check out Gameloft's The Amazing Spider-Man game. It's...amazing :)
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Even if you have been a political junky all your adult life you will be blown away with all that you learn in this book.  I'm still reading and as I do I feel as if I'm  sitting on the shoulders of these  well known politicians and Presidents with all their inner thoughts and behind the scenes dealings, revealed to me.<br />.  Fabulous book!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|This game is fan-freakin-tastic. I love the fighting style, the controls, graphics, the free roam, and the storyline. The only problems were that it kept restarting and making me lose All of my stats and skills and that it is literally impossible to beat. I was afraid to exit out of the app because half the time it would make me start over. Also, I made it to the very end only to find out I couldn't beat it. I believe I had to pull the levers with my webs to work the cranes but there was no highlight on the levers for doing such. However, even with all of that it was still worth the trouble (most of the time). I am a Huge fan of spider-man and love the effort gameloft put into this (hopefully they're not done with the effort -.- ). I highly recommend you buy the Batman:Dark Knight Rises and their other spider-man game. You won't have any problem with those. All three Great games. Please finish this one Ganeloft!!
B004NS7120|5.0|This was one of the most exciting movie we have seen in a long time.  From start to finish, it was an edge of your seat movie!  Loved it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book delivered the satisfaction of continuing the story from the moment the first book ended.  It fleshed out the plot twist of how the poison grapes spawned a revolution, yet kept the writing personal and sensitive. I 3njoyed the unfolding of the complete lack of realization by Katniss that she had become a national celebrity.  The rise of the President Snow character, with the rich characteristics from his appearance to his smell, resulted in a clear rivalry that came to dominate the story.  I will never forget the reaction by the crowd to Katniss' relationship with the tiny ally in the first games that resulted in her death, yet the horror of the shooting of the old man who whistled her call.  This book delivered, and contributed to the full story, leading to the final book.  Certainly as good as the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" trilogy, even for adults.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I think this is a very cute movie and my kids absolutely love it.  They could watch it over and over.
B0011Z7ILM|5.0|I couldn't be happier! I got a free voucher from Amazon Local for $3 toward MP3 downloads, and the album was only $6.99, so I paid a total of $3.99 for it! I've been so broke lately and unable to buy any music, so this was an unexpected deal that I couldn't pass up.<br /><br />About the band: Avenged Sevenfold is one of my absolute favorite bands for many reasons.<br /><br />One reason is that they have very professional sound quality. It's very clear, and the vocal and track levels are set perfectly. You can hear the singer's voice clearly, and you're still able to hear each individual instrument! A rare quality. Most bands set the vocals or the track too loud. :(<br /><br />Another reason is you can't ask for a more professional group of individuals who take their work very seriously, while still able to have fun while doing it! They are well trained, and the lead guitarist went to music school. He's not just talented, but professional.<br /><br />I don't want to drag this review on and on, so I will add one final thing, and let you all decide for yourselves. The music that you hear when you listen to Avenged Sevenfold is almost like classical music transformed into metal. Have you heard of a string quartet? There are a few out there that have covered a bunch of A7X's songs. If you haven't heard them yet, get on Grooveshark and check them out! Just search Avenged Sevenfold String Quartet and a few will pop up. You shall be amazed! Once you've heard that, come back and comment if you'd like! Rock on!<br /><br />P.S. I must add that these comments are for the band, and not just City of Evil. City of Evil is one of the best albums by A7X (it's the album that made them famous), but these comments go for all their albums. :)
B004UOCF3W|4.0|Not the biggest Foo  Fighters fan, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite new albums in a while!!!!!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Awesome movie...pay attention or you'll be lost!<br />Makes you think while you're watching trying to keep up with the \\"level\\" they are in!<br />See it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wanted to find out what the craze was over this book.This explicily depicts every tyoe of sexual encounter imaginable hooked on to a thin unbelievable story, redundent in every way, written for deprived depraved people mainly to sell the book,pity the poor folks who need this literature to satisfy their sexual fantasies,It suggests the need for thousands of Doctor  Ruths to educate the world.This review doesnt come from a prude but from one who has expierienced much of this in real life.Tempted to write a novel myself to prey on the needy and enhance my wealth thereby but would have to use a pen name.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|Good movie that holds you..beginning to end.<br />Spacey is great...Baker is awesome....Demi is great as the \\"bitch\\" ceo type!<br />The beginning of the end of the 2008 mess on Wall Street!!!!<br />I wish they had done another half hour to follow these fools into the mess they made!!:)
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I would recommend this book. I thought it was well written and kept your interest.It was also educational as to life in a different culture.
B008602KQI|5.0|ABSOLUTLY AMAZING!! One of the best movies I've ever seen. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Not for younger than 13 but perfect for all teens and adults.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I am a child of the 80's, played many, many hours of D&D, Atari and Ms. Packman and really enjoyed the references to the pop culture of my childhood. But the best thing about this book is the quest and the very realistic near-future setting. It's almost impossible to believe that this is Cline's first published work. His characters, while simple and archetypal, are still very realistic and of the quality of Asimov. (Yes, I said it.) If you are a sci-fi buff, a gamer or simply came of age in the 80's, you will definitely enjoy this book!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot and felt the method King used to tell the story was well chosen.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is my favorite book of the trilogy, it is the book in which the relationship escalates between the main characters.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|YES YES YES Jack Reacher is back!!!!!!!! I wish Lee Child would write more than just one book per year.
B007FU1OH6|5.0|I loved this book so much i read it in 5 days!<br />(usually would take me at least a month to read a book.)<br />Already onto the next one in the trilogy.<br />Recommended to friends already.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|A story about Jack Reacher's last few months in the army, his brother already working on the case as per the first book, absolutely beautiful writing as usual. I love Lee Child.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was not a real fan of this book!  I do not think the book started until the middle of the book and the ending was terrible.<br /><br />It was like the author got to the end and didn't know what to do!!!!!  Very dissappointed after all the hype!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You know it's a good book when your sad the book is finished ..but luckily there is 2 more... :)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I was expecting a futuristic Sci-Fi movie.  Instead I got a futuristic Teeny Bopper Love Story movie.  Not anything close to what I was expecting.  I obviously did not read the book(s). According to my daughter, who did read the books, it was not faithful to the novels.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have been using AVG at work and at home for several years now. This is real protection, not some lame app that carries phish or trojan links. I run in concurrently with BitDefender. I have not had a threat to my PC in years.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book and found that the movie did the book a service. It told a great story and stayed away from Katniss selfish nature you read in the books.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good adaptation of the book, glas Collins had so much input. Excellent casting choices (for the most part). Solid performance for theyou small budget. Looking foreward to the other two movies.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Their have been TV and Hollywood versions of Snow White lately and some people did not like the liberties that where taken with this particular story line. I thought the story was well done and tied things up very nicely at the end. The locations and scenery where the film was shot were beautiful, as well as the costumes and set decoration. A big shout out to the little people in the film. I hope you found the experience enlightening.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie and love the book! They did a great job on following with the book. Highly recommend reading and watching The Hunger Games
B007IXWL2C|3.0|In all, the three books were good. But it seems Ana is somewhat narcissistic and so is Christian.<br /><br />In book one, the sex was erotic.<br /><br />By the end of book two, you become desensitized to all the sex.<br /><br />In book three, the fiarytale end was flat. It seems Christian will end up getting his way after all Ana did to declare her boundaries. And face it, Christian has real damage and real issues.<br /><br />The story is fiction.  Like how many of us end up with billionaires.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book is almost complete and it seems like they are just doing a lot of talking, and her imagination is running wild.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was the most anticipated release of the year for my granddaughters. They read the books; they saw the theatrical release; and have been waiting impatiently for the DVD. They watched the movie multiple times over the first three or four days; invited friends over to watch as well. As always, delivery direct to their homes from Amazon was a big plus.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series has got to be my favorite of all books I have EVER read. Amazing story and written so well.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at level of violence and language. It was so well done that I hardly realized there was any.  Very good!! I hadnt read the books and had convinced myself I wouldnt like it, but I bought it for the rest of my family who loved the books. I would definitely reccommend it.
B000YMM3CC|1.0|The quality of the streaming was excellent, but the movie itself wasn't. While the story of the elderly man's love for his failing wife was touching, the story of how they got together wasn't. It relied too much on the worn out 'good girl gets bad guy' storyline,and has no real, believible romance in it; just an overeliance on steamy physical affection and sex scenes.<br />  I was very dissapointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This story could have been a good one, but it would appear it was more interested in sex acrobatics than telling a story............As far as titilating, it was, but even titilating gets old.  What again????  Too many redundant phrases, words, events.  Did this book have an editor????
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I've read just about every Philippa Gregory book in the Tudor/Cousin's War series. Love these novels, they are so entertaining & give a real good picture at what life was like hundreds of years ago. I love history so historical fiction books like these are just great! I think few reviewers said they'd like to see more of Isabel's perspective? Yeah, I could see that, but really I think the book is fine as is...I think Gregory was going for the p.o.v of a second daughter, who, at that time, probably had zero prospects & was overlooked, unless she was of nobility & parents' had plans for her, like in this book. Interesting also to see a different view of Elizabeth Woodville (in Gregory's White Queen book); I liked that book a lot, but here you get to see the other side. (If you like this Wars of the Roses topic & want to learn more, I'd recommend reading a real history book, The Wars of the Roses, by Alison Weir. She makes it entertaining.) Love these books Ms. Gregory...keep 'em coming!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely love these books and the movie didn't disappoint.  I am so excited to finally own this amazing moving and excited for the next movie to come out.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|I loved it! Couldn't stop watching. Very entertaining.  Can't wait for the next season to be available!!!  This was the first show I have ever streamed and I can see it becoming a habit.  Great for catching up on seasons you may have missed.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Another suspenseful read, which keeps you guessing and trying to put the book down.  Even reading the series out of order does not ruin the intrigue.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I really enjoyed a Prisoneer of Birth.  Plenty of plot twists, interesting characters and a classic underdog storyline made this a satisfying read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just purchase an  android tablet and was looking to get books in it. I am glad I came across this app as it makes it easier for me to read in my tablet, not just my Kindle
B00422LESO|4.0|This was delightful-- very fanciful for every girl who has fallen for the gruff Mr. Darcy! The romance was lovely, the self discovery enlightening and the ending was perfect. Very, very fun.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This book kept my interest all the way through the book.  I couldn't wait to read the next page. I liked the ending and was happy I read it.
B00122BEPA|5.0|Van Halen release for Van Halen lovers. Can't go wrong with this one. It is in heavy rotation on my playlists for sure along with their new one.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love that you get a sense of the close relationship between the main characters all the way through this version. I also like that Emma's father's issue is treated with compassion.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I had seen this program when it ran on PBS and just loved the music. When I saw it listed on Amazon, I couldn't wait to order it. This DVD is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It is wonderful!
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the books and couldn't wait to watch movie. Which was amazing  cant wait for next movie to come out
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story was sped along as quickly as the first, but with the events in this one, the timing took me out of the story numerous times. Also, the sex was much too vanilla and short for me, and there were so many sex scenes skipped. Sometimes I didn't mind the skips but I thought they might as well be written out if the rest of the story was going to be skimped like that.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I am usually somewhat dubious of the hyped movies, but was pleasantly surprised that the movie was enjoyable. I don't like the typical endings that we see on most movies (allowing much room for a sequel) like this one. However, the story line was not as child like as i had expected after it was suggested by my daughter and not as gory as I had imagined it might be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a compelling read! I couldn't put it down for a second! And now a week later, I am still stuck in their world, thinking about the characters. It's maddening to have completed the trilogy, although I was pleased with the way it was done. I just need to read it again to savor each development.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband mainly because of his favorite Goyte's top hit \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\".  In addition, he has found that this CD has several other songs he is enjoying.  Fast service - received this item in 3 days.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|This book gives a very interesting account of a gymnast's road to the Olympics.  I was fascinated to learn about what happens behind the scenes.  At the same time, the book is interwoven with very personal stories about Dominique and I found myself sharing her tears.  Although this isn't the most well-written book I've read, as a fan of the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" I was very intrigued by the subject matter.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a must read.  It's smart, exciting, and really different.  I highly recommend it.  Just be warned, you won't want to put it down!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie adaptation of the first book in Suzanne Collins' best selling trilogy.  With a cast of little know actors supported by some older well established hollywood greats the story moves along at a rapid pace.  Unfortunately not all of the book's undercurrents can be crammed into a movie.  That being said I would recommend that anyone who watches the movie also reads the book.  The book is a fantastic read!
B00723NWJE|5.0|Another great hit from Nora Jones. This one is a bit on the dark side, but the music and vocals are exquisite.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is relaxing and addictive.  this is fun. get it while its still free.  if u like puzzles get it
B007EC6FIS|5.0|This is a very good CD. The artist is from England. I will be purchasing other music CDs that he has made.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Liked the book, however, it was very repetitive.  It got boring in some chapters, because it was so repetitive, especially in the middle of the book.  However, I would recommend it to some of my friends.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written novel that captures your imagination. The only concern is why such gory novels are teen favorites. Would recommend it with caution
B008ASLK8A|5.0|My title says it all about how we liked it!! It's non stop action & so much better than the 1st movie!! Way better plot & of course Holmes is fighting off his greatest enemy of all time. We weren't disappointed at all. We rented it, loved it & would watch it again so we bought it off of amazon for a great blu ray price!! Definitely would recommend. Would even let our 12 yr old watch it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Takes you on an Incredible journey; follows the book and is well acted; superb performance by all that draws you into into the movie and keeps you there to the end!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the \\"Super Mario Brothers\\" of the smartphone era. It will be an all-time classic in years to come. As Super Mario, Donkey Kong, and Sonic have etched a place in history.....this game series has done the same.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great book, straight forward and to the point. The auther is very careful not to put any of his own opinions in the book. Gives you a clear and concise view of the mission and many others that he was on. Great book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I haves played this game for hours. I highly recommend to all. Keeps your eyes and brain working. Would be great for kids.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I think I've read every book Lee Child has written. Loved this book. Good read, page-turner that is hard to put down.
B007Q476KU|5.0|Had waited for this movie to be out for months.  I was not disappointed!  It is a heartwarming and family movie that horse lovers will appreciate.  Loved it so much I rented it more than once so all my grandchildren could watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|Th Hunger Games was a fantastic movie! I absolutely loved it. It had a great combination of Lots of action with a little romance. After reading the series I noticed a lot of little discrepancies with minor details in the movie compared to the book. But for me it didn't take away from the storyline, it was more of a personal annoyance. But overall I really love this movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me turning the pages.  The characters were exceptional and the twist in the book was surprising. However; the end left me hanging and I was not happy with that.
B007H9B6KA|3.0|Version 2.0 has always been my favorite Garbage album.  Their debut was a close second.  Beautiful Garbage was too sleek/poppy/weird for me, and unfortunately Not Your Kind of People is more like Beautiful Garbage than the others.<br /><br />If you liked their last album, you'll probably like this one.  Although I think some of the chord progressions here are boring.<br /><br />A couple earworms here, but nothing groundbreaking, and unfortunately nothing like the early Garbage I loved, either.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is WOW!!!! I have read it three times. Can't wait for October to come so I can get my hands on the second one.......... the anxiety is killing me. I love this love story where these two people are trying to get over there fears and past so that they can build a future together. It is a must read!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This wasn't the best written book that I have read; however, the story was attention-holding.  I enjoy books where the author allows the reader into the heads of the characters.  I just couldn't put this one down.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book has a much better plot line then 50 shades so it was a much easier read. Ive already per ordered the next and I hope it's worth it.
B00846REIS|5.0|if you like 50 shades of grey series you'll like bared to you i liked it better that 50 shades, very good cant wait till oct 2 for the second book to come out!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book will feed into your kinky side.  It's poorly written, yet still readable once you get into it.  The end of this book was a little hard to take given the condition of Anastatia, but I guess if you stay open minded you'll get through it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is very entertaining and I love the thougts she has and how she describes her inner self talking to her.  Fun!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book had me turning pages from the minute that I picked it up! I love that it goes from \\"current day\\" to flashbacks with each chapter. As the truth is being slowly discovered in the current chapter, you are quickly taken back to see how it really unfolded.  I loved this book and have already started reading Sharp Objects, also by Gillian Flynn.
0307454568|4.0|I had bigger hopes for this book as the two before it were true gems. The plot seemed to drag on this one but I will say that the ending makes it all worth the read. The last 200+ pages (of 600+)are hard to put down. For those who have enjoyed Stieg Larsson's books and will miss his storytelling, I would highly recommend [[ASIN:B0094IH8HC THAT GIRL STARTED HER OWN COUNTRY (The Count of Monte Cristo)]]. It has a phenomenal plot and an intriguing heroine. If you like Larsson, I think you'll enjoy That Girl Started Her Own Country.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Never got into the show, bought this for the songs. The version of the House of the Rising Sun was nicely done as was Strange Fruit. This is just a great album every song is good. TK
B001NLKT60|4.0|Definitely not as intriguing as Dragon, but entertaining nonetheless. The story of Mikael and Lisbeth is enthralling for sure but the issues myriad of issues the story tackles is a bit overwhelming. Lisbeth's character transforms from very likeable in Dragon to a bit over the top, tending to lose a bit of the sympathy I had for her in Dragon. I will miss Larsson's stories but I have found an excellent way to fill that void with [[ASIN:B0094IH8HC THAT GIRL STARTED HER OWN COUNTRY (The Count of Monte Cristo)]], which I highly recommend!
B008M34INW|5.0|Another stellar Mel Gibson performance. Great movie. Hope he keeps cranking out these kind of films. Very entertaining. I recommend \\"Get The Gringo.\\"
B007J4T2G8|3.0|While the entire trilogy could hardly be called 'great literature,' I enjoyed all three books.  Written in the first person, feminine present tense almost exclusively, it was hard for me as a male to identify with some aspects of the story.  But the plot became more complicated and interesting as the full story unfolded and it was worth my time and money.  Only a few sections really hit me with any emotional impact and the plot wasn't entirely unpredictable.
B005IQZB14|5.0|As a backpacker it made me laugh and cry. Couldn't wait to get back to it each night. A must read about finding ones true self.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read a few pages and i loved it so much that i couldnt wait to read more. Now I'm reading Fifty Shades Darker and i look forward to read the last book soon.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear is a great follow-up to Patrick Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind.  A friend (who LOVES fantasy stories) recommended them and I was reluctant to read them as I am NOT a fantasy reader normally.  What an adventure I would have missed had I not followed his advice! I would recommend them to anyone - fantasy reader or not. Well written, quite clever stories.
B008MEM24S|5.0|i love this app it is fun yet a bit hard. this is super oober fun and spunky,funky weired super fun!
B002OQT928|5.0|Well done and my three girls under the age of 8 love it.  Some of the humor is geared to adults which goes over the heads but I enjoyed the comedy portion and a nice storyline.
B004AP9W46|5.0|Anne Rice's exploration of heaven and hell and god and the devil was amazingly well written. I had never read Rice but this book made me a fan.
B0025WG4SS|5.0|All the hits and some album-track gems that could have been hits, plus some non-hits that I can only attribute to poor promotion by their tiny record label of the time.  If you are only going to pick up one Tutles album, this would be your best bet.  This would be a good primer for anyone who wanted to know the basics about one of the finest pop groups of the 1960's.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great film, book was good film did a great job of capturing the tension. Good casting. Watch the movie first, then read the book.
B001EBWISG|4.0|I love this movie!  But I had purchased it to watch on my ANdroid tablet while on a long plane ride . . . Not able to down load it to watch on a device except for a kindle . . . so I got to watch it on my lap top at hotel once connected to the web.  Still looking for a way to get movies on my tablet . . .
B00064VR0W|5.0|A very good concert. Extreamly entertaining. If you like Rod you will love this. All the songs you know buy heart.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This second version of Sherlock Holmes was very similar to the first movie - still the movie was fun to watch.
6305781427|5.0|This DVD is great. Yanni is very talented as well as nice to look at. This Dvd is also good to listen to during dinner as background music.
B001KWR3PM|5.0|It's Eric Clapton! 'The Best of' at that. No single compilation has every hit, but this one comes darn close.
B005IQZB14|4.0|excellent book -- read it if you are down and out or just need a little push to do something a little scary in your life -- then you will conquer your goal with guesto!
B008F5YDRI|3.0|One Friday evening, when our choices on cable television were absolutely dismal, we chose to downstream this movie to our TV.  The story was cute, not mind-bending or intense or theatrical, but enjoyable.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks always seems to know how to draw you into his characters and Kate is no exception.  I found this story line to be pretty predictible with not many surprises, but if you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, you will enjoy the way he builds the relationship between the main characters.  I did find the violence at the end a little much for my taste but realize it was probably necessary for a climatic ending.
B00846REIS|5.0|Even though it's not Christian's 50 shades, Gideon is steamy! I loved this story and I am anxiously waiting on the second book! What's next for Eva and Gideon?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" and couldn't wait to start book two, \\"50 Shades Darker\\"  It is my favorite of the trilogy.  But I have also read \\"50 Shades Freed\\", it is fabulous also and puts closure on the story from where the first book starts.  Great read, read all 3 in less than three weeks.  A great book, but now I'm having withdrawal,  I want more!!!!!  Hopefully she will write another series.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Carolyn Gleeson
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie bit as always the book is better. The concept behind is violent but that is the only way to get the message across.
B00756GRUE|4.0|decent construction, good solid feel except for the bracelet that rivals invicta in cheapness. its ok but not up to par with the rest of the watch. i have a seiko kinetic diver that is absolutely solid so this was sort of a disapoitment.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin is gold. Every book is just as good as the last, and the guy shows no sign of stopping. I can't wait for the next one!
B007SXB498|5.0|I liked analyzing the differences between SENSE and SENSIBILITY, and even applying them to myself and people I know.  The book itself was well-written, insightful and interesting.  I enjoyed reading it.
B008XBHIEY|4.0|It had been a while since I did a full non-broadcast viewing of this film and it did NOT disappoint. The suspense that builds in this film is so visceral and real. The characters are so fully-realized without long expository sections trying to explain who they are. The best scenes in the film are ones that, ironically, I had forgotten about so, when they hit, it was like a surprise boat oar to the gut. My only complaint is that the score is mixed so much loud than the dialogue on this edition that I was having to constantly adjust the volume to accomodate. Otherwise, a flawless film of the highest calibre.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I disliked this book enough that I waded through half of it, and then just stopped.  It is well-written, but so dark and foreboding that I simply did not enjoy reading it.  I gave it a good try but decided to go for books I actually enjoyed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Freed is my most favorite out of the series. I am anxiously waiting on the movie and even more books from E.L. James. I am not a big reader but she has turned me into one of her number one fans.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Read all three and enjoyed them all but the second book was my favorite. \\"Freed\\" was a good read, a little predictable but worth reading. I've know women are going nuts over the books, as well they should, but I would recommend men read this trilogy, they could learn a few things from Mr. Grey.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is incredible. It has so many things you can do. You can take notes, have devotions, highlight, and much more. Its amazing.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Definitely written by a brit, some of the wording is kinda off, but a good series! It's addicting and compelling and sexy. Every girl wants a Christian of their own!
B003YCIE68|5.0|This is one of the cutest christmas movies out there.  Dudley Moore is so charming as Patch the elf and John Lithgow is<br />as always a wonderful bad guy.  If you don't enjoy this movie...you must be Scrooge.
B00846TTDG|5.0|For what this movie is worth, the acting isn't too bad but it does have good action to it, over all a really good movie.
0385474547|5.0|I got this book it came very fast , was very satisfied with purchase and do recommend it . So far very intersting book
B00122KW0I|5.0|Worth the price tag, this disc includes all of the music from the extended version (including Pippin's serenade to the King), and Merri and Pippin's celebratory song at King Theoden's Hearth. Five stars!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the third sequel; however I would have liked to have seen a little bit more on the Jack Hyde story we were geared up only to be let down with just a short stint on him being in the same foster home with Christian.  Also,it would have been nice to read what actually happened in Christian's childhood; but overall i enjoyed the book.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I'm struggling to find a reason to continue reading this book. I'm halfway through at the moment and chronic boredom is setting in.  Take away the what is now becoming monotonous sex scenes and there is not much of a story line to hold my interest.  Soft porn would be the best description for this tome and not all that well written at that.  Definitely not a masterpiece such as The Story of O and similar erotica
B008602KQI|5.0|...as with all movie adaptations of books.  Although many fans will criticize the film closely, as is their right, I enjoyed the film in that it captured the spirit of the books without excising too much of the story's unique character.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|My roommate recommended this book, as it is one of his favorites. At times I had difficulty following the story. This happened more when I first started reading the book. Once you get used to the idea that you're actually reading 6 different novellas that are split up and sandwiched between each other it's easier to accept that you may be confused at times. As my roommate told me just keep reading and you will not be disappointed once you see the big picture. David Mitchell harnesses such a beautiful concept that any human can relate to. We'll see if the three directors that are joining forces for the movie adaptation can do it justice at the end of October!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|After hearing all the hype about this book, I finally decided to read it.  The writing was pretty good and, from the descriptions, you really could get a sense of actually being IN the circus.  However, the story itself left much to be desired.  It was all over the place.  You really didn't understand how a character was going to be a part of the story until MUCH further into the book.  And the story itself was just \\"Meh\\".  Good writing, disappointing storyline.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book is exciting, at times it's sad makes  you want to cry and it's makes you laugh. I can picture Fifty Shades wow!
B001D0DQUC|5.0|I really enjoy the movie. It's fun, although the language is a bit poor at times. A fun '80's movie reminding me of high school.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This film embodies the best of Star Trek, and the Original Series in particular. At its core, KHAN is about dealing with loss. With richly developed characters, and the existing deep chemistry and friendship of Kirk, McCoy, and Spock, this film is both an exciting yarn and a profound meditation. Playing on the Takeshi Maru \\"no-win scenario\\" theme, we are given two men: Kirk and Khan. Khan has lost his wife, and is willing to risk his life and those of his people in a quest for vengeance. While Kirk, the chronic \\"cheater\\" of death, must finally face the consequences of his past in the revelation of his lost son, and in Khan. The final battle-scene of the film plays out spectacularly as a classic submarine-movie type hunt, while the wise and loyal Spock must sacrifice himself to save his friends. Redeemed by Spock's death, Kirk gains new wisdom into our frail and mortal human condition, and gains new life in the \\"humanity\\" of Spock. You need not love Star Trek to find this movie great. Check out Star Trek OS episode \\"Space Seed\\" for the back-story of Khan and to marvel further at Ricardo Montalban's physique.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I did not have high expectations for this movie - to be honest I thought from the previews and commercials for it that it was stupid. I was pleansantly surprised - it's hilarious. Whether a movie is funny or not is completely subjective - so other movies I think are hilarious - Step Brothers, Shawn of the Dead, The Big Lebowski, Super Trooper. Odds are, if you like any of those, you will probably like this.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Not a favorite at all, was very disappointing. Can't say to much without giving it away. i found it extremely hard to get into and follow
B003O86FMW|5.0|Epic! Honestly one of the best books I have ever read! Very happy with purchase. Want more from this author, read everything need more!
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I found the approach of focusing on an elderly Margaret Thatcher in her declining years and flashing back to events in her life very unpleasant and disjointed. This was a Lady who had an enormous effect on her country and it would have made a compelling film to present her life story in a normal progression with minimal emphasis on her post prime minister days.
B008JH5FZ6|5.0|A film I really enjoyed. Exciting, romantic and fun. The acting was wonderful. An actor who gives a<br />performance that is winderful. Actually I watched twice the first tine.
B005ISZRES|5.0|Having not read this book since my childhood, I was quite surprised at, period mores aside, much of the human emotions/behaviors were the same as they are today. As an adult, I got so much more of the story than I did waaaay back then.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, great price.  The movie was intense and arrived on time although the movie is basically about kids, it's not for kids.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I am a big fan of Phillippa Gregory's novels; she's articulate in her work but also adds a personal note to the characters.  I have read all of her books and after reading the Kingmaker's Daughter decided I needed to go back to earlier novels to re-define the order of history.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical novels.  Can't wait for the next one!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I like this book, but not as much as the others. It's very tough to keep track of who all the new characters are and their stories and relationship to the original story, and then try to connect them somehow. .  Don't let a lot of time pass in between reads, it is very easy to get lost and too much time will just make that worse.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I was impressed that there were thought-out plots.  Just when I thought the book would start to be repetitive with the erotica overtures, another good plot would unfold.
B001EBV0P8|5.0|Movies based off of Stephen King books are hit or miss.  This one is definitely a hit.  It's no wonder it is IMDB's top rated movie of all time.  This movie is incredible.  Buy it, watch it, you won't regret it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Obviously The Hunger Games is great, but I wish that there had been a few more special features to round out this edition of the movie.  Specifically an audio commentary could have been helpful to add more depth to the movie as it goes on.  Instead we are left with mostly interviews which basically say how great and nice everyone was.  Nothing we couldn't already figure out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest app is User friendly much more so than going to the website especially when using your android devices such as kindle fire or smart phone.  I really enjoy it and glad I downloaded it!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. I had read the book first and as usual the book has more detail in just about every way.<br /><br />Making movies from good books is always hard but the movie touched on all important aspects of the book and was very exciting. I highly recommend this exciting movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I had to read all three, you get sucked in. But this supposedly racy novel, seemed at times like it was written by a teenager  (well I hope my teen isn't into this stuff ). I found myself glossing over the sex stuff, and reading the story. You will end up hating your mate after this though! You will want this girls life, well most of it! This series although repetitive in the sex scenes, and repetitive with the language, is hard to put down.
030758836X|1.0|I was wandering thru Amazon's Book Dept looking for a new-to-me author and a book(s) that sounded like stellar reads.  To my great disappointment, I purchased Gone Girl.  At about half way thru, you pretty much know what the rest of the book will sound like - page after page after page of the author listening to herself talk in her head.  My head's screwed on pretty straight - I enjoy and benefit from \\"role model\\" stories - and the two lead characters, well, all the characters, as a matter of fact, are people you and I would not want to meet in a dark alley - let alone hang out with.  So, actually society's losers - definitely not \\"role models.  Why would I want to jump into the sewer?
B0073XV2W2|5.0|If you like Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton with a little flavor of Lee Child's style, then you'll love this book by David Suarez.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Again, Amazon does an amazing job with converting videos to HD.  The movie was good, but the quality and sound were amazing!
B001AMVN3U|3.0|I bought the album for the single \\"You're gonna go far\\".  The rest of it isn't as high energy, but still pretty good.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie.  Obviously there are parts of the book that had to be cut out or modified, but overall this movie was well done and stayed true to the book.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is a great app for my Kindle Fire. Opens up for a whole new bunch of things to read on Kindle Fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked after the Hunger Games and this book was better than the first!<br />I've now read all three and have started on the Underland Chronicles by the same author.
B008602KQI|5.0|One of the best movies I ever seen, it takes you to a different world you have no time to tHink in anything else just woNderful
B0035JRVR8|5.0|I recieved the movie in great condition and in great time. A beautiful story about a princess wanting to live life like the rest of us, with freedom. And she befriends an extremely handsome guy to show her around Rome!!! My mother and I love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although it is not like the Harry Potter series in terms of plot, there are similarities: There is more than one book; it involves young adults; and there's a bit of fantasy. The main characters in each struggle against their fate, are genuinely good people who can't help but act human, and save the day even though they rather not have the burden of needing to. The Hunger Games Book 1 is not as intellectual as the first Harry Potter book, nor are the emotions plumbed to the depths of the Harry Potter characters. But it is an entertaining story suited for any demographic. You simply want to know what happens next. And it is nice to have a girl be the main character and heroine!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I couldn't get past the second chapter. I was taught you show, don't tell, when the author describes the character as \\"drop dead gorgeous,\\" she lost me.
B008602KQI|4.0|As someone who read the book first, I felt connected to the characters, emotional, and very excited. I know that when books become movies, it can be hard to appreciate it because they don't end up being as similar as I want them to be. However, this movie did a pretty good job keeping things accurate to the book. I think they did a *very* good job making certain scenes heart-wrenching. The actress who played Prim was particularly good at her part. I enjoyed it a lot. There was at least one thing I was upset about not being properly included in the movie, but other than that, I'd say this was quite a hit.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldnt put it down, I read all three backed to backed and still cant get enough.I wish there were more than 3 books.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie!! Saw it in the theater and its great for boys and girls of pretty much all ages. Its exciting, entertaining, and a great story!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldnt put it down, I read all three backed to backed and still cant get enough.I wish there were more than 3 books.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The movie jumped around a bit. I felt if I hadn't read the book the movie would have been harder to follow the story line. For being in a life of misery and doing with out in district 12, you have to admit Katniss is pretty hot!! Will wait and see how the sequel brings in district 13.
B006UUK612|5.0|If you want something to just sit down, watch and relax this movie fits the bill.  It's a nice break from drama and if you have young children they'll like the idea of crazy flying, talking to an alien and having one as a friend.  Good movie for all!!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I could not put this book down... beautifully written even though it was such a sad subject. Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
B0084A9CA2|5.0|This was an enjoyable read, offering many lessons, and will be my Holdiay gift to my family and friends regardless of their age.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love, Love, Love just finished and thinking of reading the entire series again. The descriptions in the book are amazing.  Story line excellent, leaves you guessing the entire series.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This is an utterly ridiculous movie considering the greatness Ridley Scott is capable of and has offered in the past with \\"Blade Runner\\" and the original \\"Alien.\\" The characters are no more than cut-outs. (The android is the only affecting and emotional character in the film!) Scientists? My ass! Good gracious, the Indy-500 exit speed from the spaceship into an unknown landscape: really? I guess the word \\"caution\\" at this point would not have entered the mind of a sensible scientific team. Also, \\"oh, yea, let's just ditch those helmets because it appears to breathable in here:\\" a lovely logical and educated assumption by the team. I made it to the end of the movie only with the sincere hope that the \\"aliens\\" would devour the inane characters.<br /><br />Please, Mr. Scott, I hope you reedit the movie and salvage something from this mess...if at all possible. (The script is an absolute disaster so the latter may be impossible. Maybe the way to go--since there are so many great visuals--is to just get rid of the dialogue.) I remain a very disappointed fan as I had always hoped for another outstanding Sci-Fi movie from this truly great director.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am totally wrapped up in Game of Thrones, and I haven't seen any of the series - just read the books.  The characters, and their development, are so alive I feel like I know them (or maybe people in my life who have similar characteristics!)...hurry up with book 6!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Christian Bale makes the best Batman so far, and the rest of the cast, especially Michael Caine and Liam Neeson, are superb.  Production values don't leave anything on the table.  It's a suspenseful thrill ride from start to finish.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book and thought it was one of the worst books I have ever read. Christain Grey is totally unbeliveable at 26 - maybe if he were 46 or even 56! Even then, he is so awful - always texting Ana with \\"you're defying me\\" what is that about? in 2012? I agree with the reviewer who wondered if a couple of teenagers wrote it because it does seem like it. The endless pages of silly text messages back and forth between Ana and Christian nearly did me in. The book wasn't even erotic, it was just dumb. I cannot see why this series is so popular, there is far better erotica out there and far better love stories too. If you must buy it to see what all the fuss is about, just buy book 1 and not the entire series because it really does get worse.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book started a little slow, but quickly picked up the pace and had me turning pages  with anticipation.  That is, until the end...blah. Could think of at least 3 other endings that would have been more interesting and satisfying and I'm an accountant.
0743289692|5.0|This woman is one of the bravest women to have walked the earth.  Having read her story, this is the second copy that I have purchased to give as a gift.  I think all young women should read and understand what suppression of women is all about.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I liked this movie.  It was good to rent and take with me on a plane.  I had no trouble using the app on my iPad.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book now I have seen the movie and I am not disappointed. It is beautifully done.  The actors picked for the roles fit perfectly.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a perfect film.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Great read.  Nonstop laughing.  Brilliant woman.  After reading Bossy Pants, I got a new perspective, not only on the business but also of the woman who created 30 Rock.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Non stop action.  I could not put it down. You think you might know where the book is headed then, bam, you go in another direction.  I need more!
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|Found \\"Nothing to Envy\\",more comprehensive on life in North Korea.  Camp 14 added to the story of camp life and it's horrific experiences.
B003V1WUKS|3.0|Sex. Drugs. Alcohol. Rebellion! California! Misbehaving in any way possible! Franco, a creative genius as we are all aware of, in so many ways, seems to want to layout his whole like growing up. But it is so often repetitious with too many of the same stories,  that it becomes boring. Amazon Verified Purchase
B0066WJLU6|2.0|I don't find this app useful at all. The light simply doesn't project far enough to be useful. The app developer did the best they could with the hardware available I suppose.
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw Hunger Games first in the theater when it came out. I try not to have too high exceptions for movies based off of a book because they are usually not going to be as good as the book(s). But I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was very similar to how I imagined it would be. Definitely worth owning!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh my I have really enjoyed these Grey books!  Reading about there lovestory and watching the movie in my mind has just been wonderful.  I wish there were more!
B006ID01OS|5.0|I am a manager myself, yet I never thought about the perspectives explained incisively in the book. Managers who are deeply involved in operations must read this book since they easily lose the sight of the forest for trees. The book nicely explains mission statement, vision, etc. which managers often don't really care. I have often lost sight of purpose of my organization and took actions that were not in accordance with our long-term goals and purpose.<br /><br />So, the first thing I did after reading this book was \\"paste the purpose of my organization on my wall.\\" Use this book as a practical tool and you'll feel the difference. The Strategy Wheel is another beautifully explained concept that can be readily used for formulating strategy.<br /><br />The book explains these ideas and concepts through examples such as Gucci and IKEA, which makes it a more riveting read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So I went back and forth on if I should read these books that were getting all the talk.  One of my friend finally said yes they are little on edge, but the love story is to die for so I downloaded this book and am so glad I did!  It had me from her falling into his office!  To me it was like Pretty Woman (Ana) mets Twilight (Edward).  I couldn't put it down.  I read all 3 books in less then a week.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books I was so sad there wasn't a 4th one. I couldn't put the book down till I finished and automatically bought the second and then third book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was my favortie of the 3 books!  I loved every second of this book and can't wait to read it again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story caught me up and took my imagination on a long and twisting road.  There is nothing that is what it seems to be, and about halfway through the book I started wondering about my own powers of perception.  The characters are compelling, and deeply complex.  The author's writing style is almost conversational, and written from the viewpoints of the main protagonists.  These two are locked in a passive-aggressive battle, and I kept turning the pages as their stories peel back the individual layers of history.  It was very hard to put down, and lingers after turning the last page.  I would like a follow-up book, because real closure is not provided.  Does one ever really know their spouse?
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really loved this book!  I don't want to give a thing away so I will just say it is a must read from begining to end!  Then get Point of Retreat!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book and I can actually say I liked it better than 50 Shades of Grey.  Can't wait for the next book in October
B004UC4HCG|4.0|Now that I've had the PC running for a couple of weeks now, here are my thoughts on it. The overall look and feel of the system is good. It definitely looks built from quality materials. The step-by-step guide provided is helpful. The one thing that was not clear is how much of thermal paste to apply when installing the CPU. After looking at various videos on youtube, I ended up using about one third of the paste provided. I've run the Intel Burn Test in \\"Very High Stress\\" mode for over one hour and the max CPU temp was 72 degrees. This means the custom \\"ICE cooling\\" is pretty good!

B007Q476KU|4.0|It had a strong story and it carried me over the whole time. I didn't feel the time passing by. It was a good movie
0525953728|5.0|As the mother of a Marine officer recently returned from Afghanistan, I learned more about the Seals than I thought I knew.  For many people writing reviews, they seem to act like \\"they already knew all this stuff\\".  I for one had never seen the details of life as a Navy Seal.  The reviewers will probably fall into one of two groups:  1. \\"I already knew all this crap\\"  and 2. \\"Oh my God, he released every national secret we have with an agenda to embarrass and unseat Obama\\".<br /><br />It was neither.  It was a GREAT READ, a way to be there that day.  An honest telling of the story of the KILLING of a slimebag and weakling.<br /><br />I find it most interesting that there is no mention in the book of what I often suspected to be one of OBAMA'S BIG LIES: to \\"capture bin Ladin if possible\\", as they never trained for that contingency. And they trained a lot!!!<br /><br />I am struck by the sacrifices these brave men make for our right to sit here and critique their efforts.  I am humbled, and will heed the author's suggestion to join a cause greater than myself. And please, help the next veteran you see, shake his hand, and contribute to legitimate wounded veterans funds.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is awesome. it reminds me of a game I played years ago called Lolo (I think that's the name). The whole family got into solving those puzzles. Great times! Cannot wait to share this game with them

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This Blu-ray edition of THe Hunger Games is the highest quality copy you can own at present, unless you were able to lift the Cinematic Master from the studio vault.  Separated into 2 discs, the film and the accompanying special features, Gary Ross' take on the Suzanne Collins bestseller is presented here in all the quality he and Lionsgate intended.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This writer's work had a profound effect on how I go about making decisions.  I now ask myself, \\"am I truly thinking logically to solve a problem, or is my process clouded by unpercieved emotions, attachments, restricted datasets, etc?\\"<br />How to parse these often hidden effects on one's thinking is not easy to recognize, and Daniel Kahneman takes you through all the permutations of the poor decision making process and personally did the research to back up his work.<br />Don't miss it, and do read it cover to cover. You will thank yourself.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book!  It took me very little time to read, as there wasn't a dull moment. I would definetly recommend!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I've really enjoyed this app on my Kindle Fire.  The app doesn't take nearly as long to load as the website does when on my device.<br /><br />The layout is simple is design and extremely easy to navigate.<br /><br />Occassionally the app won't load and will only give me a white screen until my device asks if I would like to &quot;force close&quot; the app.  Each time I say yes and am able to immediately reopen the now working app.<br /><br />My suggestion to improve this app would be the capability to download photos directly from the app instead of having to go to the website it's from.
B004MIOKDY|5.0|This is a MUST if your are interested in negotiation. Although there are new books (this one has been in the market for more than three decades), in my opinion most of the new options are based essentially in the principles of negotiation included in this book. I have read this book several times, and remains to be very useful and essential. I suggest buying also, at least, William Ury's \\"Getting Past No\\", Robert Mnookin's \\"Beyond Winning\\" and Daniel Shapiro's and Roger Fisher's \\"Beyond Reason\\".
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love the book and love the characters Travis and abby. Can't wait for walking disaster in april 2013 already preodered!

B007JLCO34|5.0|This book had to be the first book on the kindle to honor my daughters and I and to honor bonds between sisters.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is a tribute to the brave men that protect our freedom. It's encouraging to know there are still people who will risk their lives for a cause bigger then themselves.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book read like more of a romance novel with a few surprise twists. It was an easy read and enjoyed the story. Ready for the third book  to see what happens to this interesting couple.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I am completely hooked on the  Game of Thrones series but somewhat disappointed with Dance With Dragons.  Just can't get past the feeling the author is introducing many new characters to keep the series going while sacrificing the more important plot introduced in the first book.  The author makes excuses for some chapters being out of sequence and it's just that....an excuse.<br /><br />Hey Amazon,,  you charged me more for Dance With Dragons for my Kindle than I would pay for a paperback!!  Don't think we haven't noticed!
B007SGM084|5.0|I HAVE TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS TRILOGY!!!!!!!  HAD TWITCHY FINGERS WAITING TO CLICK TO THE NEXT PAGE ON MY KINDLE. STAYED UP WAY TOO LATE AT NIGHT BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. FABULOUS TRILOGY.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|This was a super awesome film!  Having the convinience of buying it for my kindle fire even better!  Love the movie and love the added bonus of being able to directly load the movie onto my kindle fire!  The quality was excellent and extremely clear.  Would have been nice though if I had the option to stretch it out so it would fill the whole screen.  I have not found a way to do this yet with the kindle fire and a wide screen film maybe I am missing something.  Fun film great for kids and adults a real joy!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The back and forth dialogues took some getting use to. The ending left me with a feeling of disbelief that there should have been more to it. Know it has been on the top reading list and that is why I purchased it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Super Awesome movie! love being able to order it for my kindle fire I can carry it anywhere now!  Intense film with a Strong message!  Hightly recommended!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I haven't read a book start to finish that was not a college course requirement. Loved all the books! Recommend the whole set to anyone!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read! Couldn't put this book down!!! Gets you hooked with in the first few chapters. I've recommended it to all my friends.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Game of Thrones Season I (INSTANT DEMAND) and picked it up after having read the first novel.<br /><br />Now well into the 3rd novel, I am wondering when Amazon will get Season Two on instant demand.... still waiting with money in my pocket.  Good thing I have my Kindle!<br /><br />Jeff
B0088X7YMS|4.0|Not bad. It's all CGI. I sort of liked how they worked at getting the action and such to flow. It's hard using CGI to do this and they pretty much made it work.<br />  As far as the story goes, it follows the Starship Troopers story line pretty good. I think that made Carl a bit more sinister than the previous movies but I guess that's OK, as I guess if you had his mental \\"gifts\\" you might be too. I noticed there was a good job of using the stuff from the previous movies too. (One note: They really must make their starships really well to have that ship go thru what it went thru an still crash in one piece!) Anyway, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next one.
B008602KQI|5.0|I purchased this movie for my grandchildren and they love it.  I think they have watched it three times already.  I watched it with them one time and found it to be a very good movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best series I have read in a long time. I really hope the movie does it justice! Amazing price for the whole set!
B008602KQI|5.0|Didn't read the books, although now I'm tempted. I am still a bit haunted by the overall storyline concept. Looking at society today it feel all to possible. Not for the faint of heart. Let's just hope some kids don't think it's cool and try it out. I look forward to the next movies for closure.
B004TI5N38|5.0|You can always count on Baldacci.  He is a phenomenal storyteller.  He does a great job weaving several storylines in and around the main plot.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This is a good book, very expilicit but a good story. It was a little bit hard to get into but about half way through I was addicted.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|This new version is horrible! When the letters pop up after you touch them, its so distracting! I used to love SwiftKey, but im considering uninstalling :-(
B0079NQZLE|2.0|The previews to this movie really outlined the awesome and disturbing scenes of the movie but when you actually start to watch the movie, you notice instantly that the attacks are so fake and the action is obviously fake. It's like trying to watch a sixties flick and botice the guy missed the girl with the knife yet she spray blood and acts like she\\"s dying. It was f<br />Pretty bad. Oh and if your English. Don't bother with the language, it's really bad
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a book that fast. It was very entertaining never a doll moment, an I wanted to read all the time.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Was an easy app to set up. Tested both in the home and away and worked flawlessly. Not sure how often I will use it, but it is an easy tool to use.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|Once you get out in the real world and try to follow your ideals and dreams of youth, you might see that it is harder to keep focused than you believed.  Dreams change, goals change, and this movie really lets you see that and feel it with characters that you can identify with and care about.
034580404X|5.0|I read these 3 books in a week.  Couldn't put it down. Story is fantastic.  I am recommending to everyone I see.
B008GFI4V8|4.0|It really irritates me when Amazon combines reviews for a particular title, regardless of the many mediums it's available in.<br /><br />This review is for the 5 disc extended edition blu-ray set for the second film. Not the trilogy blu-ray set, in case this somehow ends up on that page as well. This review will be posted for all three films since most of what I'm going to say pertains to all of them, but any film-specific information will be kept to that respective film. Once I've found 37 hours to have some friends over for a marathon I'll return and give my opinion of the upgraded format. For now this is just a review of the packaging and other things I noticed that might impact someones decision to buy or not.<br /><br />I ordered these separate extended sets because I had read many reviews for the extended trilogy blu-ray set saying 'the Fellowship' has a green (I think it was green) hue prevalent throughout. I did read one review saying the issue could be resolved with some TV adjustments. Beyond that inconvenience I was hoping two things would be different with these sets: first I thought maybe the green issue would be fixed (I'll let you know if that's the case in my update for 'fellowship'), and second I was thinking maybe a more understandable reason for a re-release would be to make all 5 discs (15 between three films) blu-ray. This is not the case. That was the first thing I checked and all the non-feature discs say DVD, while the two discs for the main feature say blu-ray.<br /><br />To sum up, I am happy I bought these sets if only for the beautiful cover art on each. If you don't care about the cover art, if you're not worried about having 15 blu-ray discs total, and if the possibility of a green-less 'fellowship' isn't a big deal, then it probably doesn't matter if you buy these sets or the whole trilogy blu-ray set.<br /><br />I'll update hopefully soon with info on the films themselves.<br /><br />Update 09/13/12<br /><br />So I've finally watchedthe film since purchasing and I want to give my thoughts as I did with \\"Fellowship\\". I really can't say much. The movie looks great, but it looked great in 2002 also. I feel like the images are crisper and colors more vivid, but without a side-by-side comparison it's hard to tell. Snobs might complain but they're just wanting to be heard when they do.<br /><br />Enjoy. :)
B005LW5J9O|3.0|I enjoyed this book and as a reader with a casual interest in the ancient world, I learned quite a bit about Lucretius, the Epicureans and their conflicts with the church.  It is also fascinating to learn about \\"book hunters\\" and how they recovered and copied ancient works such as \\"On the Nature of Things.\\" Unfortunately, the causal connection between Poggio's \\"discovery\\" of the manuscript and the Renaissance seems a stretch.
B00004SVGE|5.0|I have many dvd audio discs but this DTS CD just really stands out and sounds great.  Diana's voice just envelopes you through your home theater set up.  Just make sure your cd or dvd player is setup right (digital/optical cable, etc).  If so, you will see the DTS symbol on your receiver and you WILL hear the difference from a regular CD.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I fought this series for over 5 months. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down....literally! Finished the series within 5 days. I only wish this series kept going and going and going.....lol
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The moment I started reading, I couldn't stop. It really captivates you! However at the end it's a completely different drama than all the books combined.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am very glad that I read the first book of the trilogy before seeing the movie.  I would have been really confused during some parts of the movie because the movie did not explain certain things.  I am ready to start reading the second book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nice puzzle game, great graphic, good music. Excellent to when taking a break from busy day schedule. What else can you wish? Thanks, Amazon !
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|Excellent book. I have never seen the movie, I did enjoy the back stories of all the characters. It was a little long winded at times and had too much detail about characters who were not that important to the over all plot.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follet has once again written a great story with characters that keep your interest as well as giving you a close up look at historical events that shaped our world can't wait till book two comes out
B003WKOU0G|5.0|This was a beautiful movie about babies.  I have 3 kids of my own and I can tell you I cried a few times through this movie.  This movie will give you a nice mental break from the craziness of this world.  Made my heart melt!
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This album is so good. If you are a fan of good music, buy this. So much emotion and raw talent.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book kept my attention.  I was reading it every chance I had.  I hit the last page of the book and had to go to the third book immediately.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book kept my interest the whole time - I couln't put it down.  It kept me guessing the whole time about the real killer.  The ending was a shocker, I didn't even see it coming.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators is a good read. I enjoyed the characters and the interaction between them.  I have read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed the comedy in this one.  I found the plot to be a bit predictable but it was still enjoyable.  I would have given it five stars but it got a bit bogged down and could have moved a little faster.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I gave this one star more than the writting quality likely rated but it was such a compelling story that it would be nearly iumpossible to ruin it just by slightly 2 rate writing, the story was where it all was.<br /><br />First I thought I would touch on the non-book replated politics and noise. This is not a Swift Boat sequal, it does not trash anyone other than our enemies and does not even trash them as bad as it could have. There are no \\"Watergate\\" moments, no Washington DC insider info and political fighting.<br /><br />This is a meat and potato's book about the SEAL's post 9/11, the first half of the book merely follows the effort it takes to get on to any SEAL team and then what it takes to get on the best of the best team, but not in painful detial, just enough to give you the clear image of some very very dedicated and highly trained killing machines.<br /><br />The author attempts to make no excuses, these guys like what they do, and do it very well, it just happens to usually involve killing bad guys, however a rescue here and there is a nice change of pace for them.<br /><br />Being ex-Navy myself, I have never really had much interest in non-fiction military books, been there/done that, but I did want to hear a first hand account of the mission from a non-political and non-technical perspective, to get a feel for what it might really be like. I loved how he captured the \\"hurry up and wait\\" nature of the Military, especially the Navy. Since he spends very little time explaining why the military does certain things I suspect ex-military might get a little more out of it than others, but not a lot more.<br /><br />If you are looking for a birds-eye view of the final attack on the compound this is a must read, just do not go into expecting it to be trashing Obama or the government in general, and don't expect it to be from the \\"master plan\\" perspective, this was a grunts perspective all the way, right down to what they likely shoot the bull about.<br /><br/>About mid-book you get to the real mission and from that point on it is hard to turn the pages (swipe the screen) fast enough, it builds slowly and I was sort of thinking, this is going to be a let down, but then the story explodes, I felt like I was waiting for the \\"GO\\" order and the frustration of waiting for the call, so you can sort of imagine what it was like in their shoes, and for a book like this you really can't ask for a lot more and keep it real.<br /><br />So overall, I can highly recommend this for a non-fictional account of that day and personally (I am not a lawayer) I don't think it gave up anything classfied or that could be used against our troops so I think of the Gov goes after him it will be business as usual, our government wasting money.<br /><br />I am glad we have guys like this looking out for us, the world is a very hard place and sometimes you need very hard people to deal with it, this is where these guys come in, they get the job done.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Yes, It's a Dr. Suess story, but it has a profound statement to sent to all.  In this story the main figure sets off to make his fortune.  He creates a unique item that is hard to market.  On his final day of finally giving up hope, luck would have it that his creation is desirable.  So desirable that he has to go into mass production.  Even while his forest friends beg him to stop, he ignores them and continues to use and consume all the trees in sight to create his fortune.  Eventually, he has to shut down his operation as he has used up all the raw materials (trees).  It is years later that a young boy, in striving for the attention of a girl, uncovers this mystery as he searches for a real tree.  His modern world has everything that once was natural or organic manufactured with new features and lights and fanciful things made out of metals or plastics.<br /><br />It sends a good message in a fun and \\"cartoony\\" way to all that we need to use only what we need, protect our resources, not be blinded by money and look to the things that really matter: family and friends - not material things.<br /><br />This will be a new movie to add to our Cub Scout pack's Movie and Popcorn nights and we will show this right before Earth Day each year.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|No obscenely rich mogules with extravagent gifts, private islands or boats and planes that I know nothing about...just relatable true love. It's funny, exciting, sexy...My favorite book by far.
B003O86FMW|3.0|LOved book one, but book 2 was alittle slow, hard to keep all the people straight.<br />Just not nearly as good a book one
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So good I never put it down! I couldn't wait to see what the next page brought and the next. What a great story line.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was one of the best I have read in a long time. I'm looking forward to reading<br />more if Sylia Days material. I'm checking to see if there is a continued one for this one.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I had read to book and had high hopes for the movie. The movie was great, and my husband who didn't read the book like it, too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is really interesting reading for a guy. Just had to see what all the women were fussing about. LOL good stuff
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I will admit that I do not read much so I catch up via the movies. This was very entertaining, thought provoking and well acted. I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the second one.
B00004OCQ2|2.0|In my never ending quest to find a great hard rock band with great,heavy guitar I had first heard of Jake on Ozzys BATM album . So with all of the stellar reviews , I thought , this can't miss . Well , I was wrong . What a boring typical snoozer of an album this is . I bet whoever recorded it had to snort tons of coke just to stay awake during the making of this gem . I will NEVER take stock in any customer reviews again . Next time I go to get gas in the car , I'll just leave it laying on top of the pump like I did with that great Izzy Stradlin CD I purchased a year or 2 ago . What a POS that was  . Guess I go back to my old standbys from Megadeth , Peace Sells and Rust in Peace,  hey , they both have Peace in the title , Maybe I need to look for other stuff with Peace in it for it to be good , because this Dusk album is a piece all right . Adios muchachos , and good luck in your quest for \\"the right stuff \\" , cause it ain't here with DUSK.....
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Loved the effects and the fact that if brings closure to<br />the story line and it was great in 3D !!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|THE MOVIE WAS ALRIGHT, SUSPENSEFUL, THOUGH IT LACKED A GOOD ENDING I THOUGHT. I LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER AND HIS ROLE IN THE MOVIE.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie was ok but a bit of a let down after all the hype.  I really wish I had not read the book so I might have enjoyed it more.  Just was a little flat.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Complete and utter garbage.  There's plenty of (comparable) trashy romance at your re-sale shop for less than a dollar. And since your local re-sale shop is probably a non-profit, that 50 cents may be going to a good cause, unlike the money I spent for this \\"kindle\\"ing.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Book 4 is mostly about smaller characters and for chapters you are wondering what is happening to Arya, Jon and Tyrion.  I justed wanted to get through it to get on to book 5!
B00355L2TU|4.0|I like how quick the workout is, but I still sweat my butt off too! So far I've only done Level one, but it's going good :-)
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|If you're in a long term relationship (20+) this story is sure to strike a nerve.<br /><br />Long term relationships have their ups and downs and often settle into patterns, even uncomfortable ones. Harold's \\"awakening\\" destroys the existing complacency and silent suffering he and his wife have learned to ignore in order to co-exist.<br /><br />A wonderful read with scratchy characters I grew to love with each page.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved this Movie!! So do all my kids :) its not your Disney fairy tale movie. But still great!!
B008602KQI|4.0|While I felt Hunger Games was a good movie, having read the books first (who hasn't????) I missed what I felt were certain key elements that were not included in the movie.  I also did not feel \\"gripped\\" with the movie as it moved too slowly in the beginning.  It only reached the \\"I'm holding my breath\\" stage at the very end, but it wasn't a slow build to that state....it was a passive enjoyable watch until the last 20 minutes or so.  Woody Harrelson was underused....Stanley Tucci was superb, and Donald Southerland appropriately lurking evil.  As for the \\"kids\\" themselves, they were well cast and well played.
B0094LV94W|5.0|I'm very very confused why this doesn't have more reviews. Amazing show. Great story. This really needs to be watched in HD.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]  The third installment is good but at thimes the story line drags on more than book two which was a great read and i couldn't put down.  This installment i am reading over two weeks and am not done.  Book two i read in three days!
B00846TRHY|3.0|Wife and I enjoyed it. True story and some pretty rough imagery of what is going on in North Uganda and southern Sudan. Pretty inspirational and at least made me reevaluate priorities in my life. Sam Childers is a true blessing to those kids. Acting was okay, the accents were off. The people in the church sounded more like southerners than people from Pennsylvania. Other than that, a good movie that brings to light the work of a man who saw a need to help the kidnapped kids.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie represents the story told in the book very well which is unusual. A great addition to the video library.
B00846REIS|3.0|I thought this book was not very well written, and I was bored with the book.  A little too predictable.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie set is beautiful and packed with extras. Amazing blu ray quality. I highly recommend purchasing this product for yourself ad week as friends and family.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|It's hard to beat a JOHN WAYNE MOVIE & add RBT. MITCHUM, James Caan, A. Honnicutt and YIPEE KAI AMAZON. Probably have seen it a few times before so already know it's great.
B0010SEMP0|3.0|I am liking this series fairly well.  I hope it gets better as it goes.  It isn't totally excellent but it is enjoyable.
B007SGM084|3.0|Started out pretty shocking and weird but about 3/4 of the way through the first book it starts getting a plot to it and starts making some sense, then in the second book it gets harder to put down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading all 3 books...I felt the last one could ended with a little more bang but overall I was satisfied.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I'm not much of a reviewer -- I read all the time - I will read just about anything -- but this book was outstanding.  I have compared it to The Help but there is so much more depth to this book than in The Help and I LOVED The Help.  It is a must read.  Enjoy!!
B0088P2A7A|2.0|why the derp does wikipedia need to know your exact GPS AND wifi location!?!?! EXTREMELY disappointed. stupid permissions ruin everything!!!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|You will enjoy this movie much more if you see the original first. Downey has the role to perfection, and the plot is<br />entertaining and lively throughout the movie.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|There is too much missing and left out of the story line to make this movie any good. By leaving out crucial details like the relationship between Gale and Katniss will alter the story line.as far as movies go the special effects were mediocre.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My kids love this moive and as a parent, you can enjoy it as well.  A good family movie that everyone can enjoy.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Not what I was expecting from Stephen King!  Very interesting from start to finish.  11/23/63 happens to be the day my mom found out she was pregnant with me.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoied the movie but didn't read the book. I'm not sure how faithfully it followed the book but it was good.
B008602KQI|5.0|As huge fans of the book series, I was worried about a movie version. However, I was not disappointed and was impressed by Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book is an articulate and insightful view into historic Williamsburg. It made me laugh, cry, and made a lasting impression on my heart. Bravo.
0525953728|1.0|It is sad that this guy would jeopardize the lives of others and potentially divulge national secrets, in addition to violating his oath and honor, in order to make a profit and name for himself. This is a book that should be boycotted.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|this book gripped me, i couldn't put it down. i laughed and cried<br />it is beautifully written and if felt like chatting with my best friend.<br />characters were portrayed so well i felt like i knew them personally<br />my top summer read this year
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Best non-fiction I have read in two years.  This book portrays the insight into the dealing of a generation of former Presidents and how they deal with one another after their tenure is complete.  Fascinating.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app let's me know how much battery I got left instead of those stupid bars I recamend it to those who need to find out how much the apps they have are killing you battery
B001O53BK6|4.0|Classic hero's quest movie cast in a new light. Better than expected. Some great cameos too. Should appeal to fans of This Is Spinal Tap and Almost Famous.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept my attention from the get go, and I loved Cheryl's writing style. I felt as though I was hiking the PCT with her! Really enjoyed hearing about a woman who went through some really rough times (I too got divorced at the ripe old age of 27 last year) and it was refreshing to hear about how she came out better on the other side. Would reccomend to anyone!
B0085OEU1I|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much. Johnny depp does an outstanding job playing his role, as a man who lost everything and seeks to have revenge. Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful in a sad creepy way, she dreams of being johnny depps wife in this film. From beginning to end I was glued to the screen. I enjoyed everything this film had to offer, from the singing to the slicing to the baking every bit was wonderful.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|The Lorax was a good adaptation of the book with some added environmentalism.  The opening scene with the bottled air was funny and classic.  Good movie.  Kids love it.
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|Love the bass lines in every song. I don't think Danger Mouse has ever done anything I don't like. Norah and Jack are great vocalists in their songs, but the instrumental songs are just as good
B000VZYW1M|4.0|Great Traffic album. Owned 2 vinyl copies over the years.<br />Saw band at Electric Factory (Phila) right after this came out.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The Outland series is SO GOOD!! This is book 3 and each one is just as engaging as the other.
0345529057|5.0|This is probably my favorite series I have ever read. A friend recommended them to me last Christmas and lent me his copies of the first three books. A Storm of Swords has some of the most well written chapters in any book I have come across. I have since convinced two other people to start reading the series. It's a shame we have to wait another ~2+ years for the Winds of Winter to come out. Five stars.
B0052QXAEK|5.0|Really good retelling if beauty and the beast, its a darker movie though so if your not into that type of scene I wouldn't watch it.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I like the puzzles okay but I constantly have trouble downloading.  Just stops working.  The only way to make it work is to redownload program and then I lose all puzzles.  The games are really a lot of fun but these glitches need to be worked out.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|This is def one of the better made lesbian movies out there.  The chemistry between the two main characters was off the charts.  Typical love story of protracted angst, finally get together, trouble ensues, and happy ending.  Great date night movie!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Enjoyed the book, characters can be a little confusing sometimes but looking forward to the rest of the series. Would recommend it to my reading friends.
B008133MDK|5.0|This adaptation of Sherlock Holmes is brilliant. It is well crafted and written. The only downside is there needs to be more.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|At first I put it down feeling this was too depressing. But it wasn't. It was an odd slice of life with a lot of heart,
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great read...I couldn't put it down. It just goes to show that people can change...with some help from others!<br />My Kindle died in the middle of this book and I had to wait for a replacement in order to finish.  Amazon was great in handling the problem!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I wasn't overly \\"taken\\" in by this program but then I'm in my 50's. I can imagine being well entertained though for teens, adolescents, and a few twenty somethings probably even more so if you've read the books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awsomeness in this game is uncountable especialy ifits in 101 in 1 is so awsomasing cool cool cool cool cool cool cool awsoopoloom
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is a book where yau always say \\"MORE\\"! The story gets better and better. When you least expect it a new twist takes place and you end up asking yourself Why, How and What next.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Storm of swords might be my favorite book in the series so far! It has a great plot, full of twists and turns you'd never expect. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in fantasy fiction or anyone who likes to read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was curious about all of the hype going into this series and maybe that is why it took me so long to read it.  By the time I finished the last page of the third book though I got it!  It was a captivating read.  The characters were complex enough to make them intresting but not so much so to make them unbelievable.  Sure the story line is far fetched, but hey it's a story and it's supposed to to take your mind out of this world and put it into another world...so good JOB!  If you're looking for a quick read with lots of twists and turns and excitement and maybe a thing or two to try at home later tonight this is your series.  Happy reading.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|I love the author's thorough research which surfaces in detailed and precise technical scenery/action all over the book.<br /><br />But Suarez goes even better by constructing wonderful characters, both heroes and villains, that we empathize/hate strongly as the story line unfolds and they suffer/unleash an increasingly dangerous sequence of thrills.<br /><br />It's the kind of book that you don't want to pause reading unless you are forced to, or you've reached it's end. Happily it wasn't broken in two books, like the Daemon/Freedom pair, it would be painful to have to wait for the second title to come out... :)
B002N14GPE|5.0|Every awesome horror movie I remember that has orphans in it, someone always dies or comes close to it. That's reason enough to get this movie. plus delivery was great
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|After reading A Discovery of Witches I immediately read the second book as well...now i'm desperate for the final book to come out!  If you like witches, vampires, history, and alchemy this is the series for you!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the fact that the storyline was able to stay away from the Twilight stereotype that so many vampire books have jumped on the bandwagon with.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is a must have! I am not an avid reader, but this was completed in less than a week.  The movies don't give this book series justice.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|GREAT BOOK,ALWAYS KEEPS YOU INTRIQUED AS TO THE NEXT TURN OF EVENTS.NOT LIKE OTHER BOOKS THAT START WITH SOMEONE BEING KILLED AND THAN SOLVING THE MYSTERY,I'M TIRED OF THAT,HE TELLS A STORY OF PEOPLE I GUESS.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought all three books were great! I'm not a reader at all and these books kept me very interested!! Great story line!!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Loved it - as a bonafide page-turner. As any good thriller, the characters are in impossible situations, and the descriptions of the tragedies that enfold the characters are disturbing even weeks after I read the book.  I'm really looking forward to Flynn's next reads.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|The movie is great, a great adaption of the children's book.  I however did not find the streaming service satsifactory and stopped watching the movie to go and rent it for less money for a high quality blu-ray experience... much beter.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the more enjoyable reads of contemporary books I have ever devoured.  Witty, poignant and fast moving.  I hope to read more from this author.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|A brilliant read from the first page, excellent mixture of suspense, emotion, wonderfully vivid and true descriptions of the isle of Lewis. A powerful novel, thank goodness there are 2 more to follow! (I've already started the Lewis Man)
B008602KQI|5.0|I read all 3 books in about 5 days and was so excited to see the movie. When I did I knew I would buy the DVD. I preprdered it and it arrived rIght within the window
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This series is awesome! If you like the hunger games series this has a similar dystopian storyline. I cannot wait for the third book requiem. I highly recommend !!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Very fun game.  I've killed a lot of time playing it.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because its basically the same level over and over again.  A change of scenery would be nice.<br /><br />That being said, I definitely recommend the game, as you aren't required to make any in app purchase to enjoy and advance in the game.  For ppl saying it is too hard without buying stuff, I've had no problems, so it must a question of skill =)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so much fun, it is addicting. Its simple enough that anyone can play, but fun enough that it will keep you busy for days. Playing on Samsung Galaxy S3
B0058YPL66|4.0|I love the stories in this show and its so creative etc. (even if the disks skip a little, but I wonder if its my tv/dvd). This series is well worth it for anyone who loves a twist on fairy tales etc.
B003O6MC6W|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. No matter what kind of music you like, this should transcend all your musical tastes. This is a beautifully crafted masterpiece and will move you physically and emotionally. Do yourself a favor and treat your eardrums with these beautiful frequencies. :)
B001ANSS5K|4.0|First of all John green is an amazing author so I knew that this book would be pretty good from the start. Paper towns is an excellent read and keeps you wanting more. This is a book that was hard to put down for me, you get caught up in the relationships of the characters and that's always something that happens when you read a good book. I loved it!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This inane book reads like a schoolgirl's comic with un-necessary sexual explicitness with no enticing erotica. If I hadn't bought it on my Kindle I would have thrown the print version in the nearest bin.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good Book, Twisting Plot Line. Definitely sucks you in. Would recommend for someone looking for a nice, easy, quick read.
B0088D3PYE|5.0|This writer shows a marked and delightful improvement with each new book.The Prisoner of Heaven re-uses all the charectors we have come to know and love from Ruiz Zafon's earlier books in a whole new adventure. Most excitingly he leaves us with the promise of further adventures to come. Five Stars well earned.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I have been hooked on these guys since I stumbled onto their EP here on Amazon.  They have such a full and melodic sound that is simply impossible not to turn up and feel.  They really aren't like anything out there.  They are pretty consistently medium tempo, but they really know how to mix up their sounds.  Some are more groovy songs, some reflective, and some quite hard hitting.  All while staying within the same general tempo range.  I really recommend these guys and truly hope they have continuing success.<br /><br />Standout Songs for Me:<br />1.) Radioactive: That deep breath right at the beginning really gets me.  I love it and the entire song.<br />2.) Demons: The lyrics on this one are definitely the most beautiful and the chorus is one of the best I've heard.<br />3.) Bleeding Out: Just a dynamite song with feeling and nice build.
1596912863|5.0|I just spent 30 mins searching for this book, because I forgot the title, but I could tell you everything that happened and all about the characters. At first I didn't like the main character she was sort of a loser, but once she got to England she opened up and I couldn't put this book down. My initial thoughts on her arriving at the Manor, were ok great this is awesome, why doesn't a real place like this exist, and then the more I read the more it was a facade and like any other make believe place the people were just actors. I really really enjoyed this book and the ending was awesome too. My heart was melting and I was crying for happiness.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got the book because, as a middle school teacher, I wanted to know what the hype was all about and to be prepared if students were reading it.  I'm not a teacher who bans books, although I do have a section of \\"mature content\\" for which students need parental permission to read.<br /><br />I won't bore you with all the ways this is terrible, trite, writing.  (How many times can she mention her \\"inner goddess\\"? - help me!  At first it seemed like a stock romance novel.  Unbelievable characters that simply don't exist in the real world, silly life situations, and then taking the main character and having her make uncharacteristic stupid choice after stupid choice.<br /><br />Life lessons students might learn in the first 100 pages?  That even strong females with goals and some wisdom can easily fall for a cold, manipulative man simply because he's very rich and unbelievably attractive.  We get to watch him groom her for his pleasure.  To date him she must sign a non-disclosure contract where she doesn't tell anyone anything about what they do.  CAN YOU SAY RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN?  How realistic is that?  But she does.  And as he gets her trust, he shows her his amazing room of sex torture.<br /><br />So what do impressionable minds learn from that?  Guys can learn to expect that girls will participate in any sex activity, and they can be the ones in control (that's what gets him off, the controlling and the pain), they just have to set things up right.  What an awful message.  And girls can learn that this is somehow an OK way to act and that it's OK to be a weak-minded sex object.<br /><br />I actually had to stop reading, although I skipped 50 pages or so and read a bit to check for improvement, skipped more, etc.  The book never redeemed itself, and the writing never improved.<br /><br />I guess the attraction is the detailed sex scenes.  Ugh.<br />It breaks my heart that this book is so popular when there are thousands of worthwhile books to read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild was a fun read. I was sad when it was over, as I was ready to keep hiking on the Pacific Crest trail with Cheryl Strayed, and sharing her adventures. If you are an outdoor enthusiast or even if you are not you will enjoy this book. It is well written,funny, and informative at the same time. I am motivated now to try out my hiking boots on a part of Pacific Crest Trail for a few weeks next summer. Cheryls adventure could be anyones, and it could be yours! Read it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book in the series. It was/is so addicting. These was a little suspense in this book compared to the first book and I loved the development of Ana and Christian's relationship in this book. The read was easy and fast. The sex scenes were hot but it definitely not my favorite part of the series. I really liked the development of the characters and the changes they made to keep together. I was never a huge reader but this series turned me onto the love of reading all type of books. It has been a month since I read this series and I finished another 10+ books since then. My husband could not believe the change. I am always looking for an author that compares to EL James because I love her writing, but no such luck so far.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Awesome film, well acted, good adaptation of the book.  Amazing how this film appeals to so many - young and old alike.  Looking forward to The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this series! The first book was a slow read for me. I could not get into it until on/about chapter 10. After reading the other two books in the series I realized I liked the set up of the first book too, I just didn't know it until I was done reading the series. I am not a huge reader, but after reading this series I am now an avid reader looking for other great reads. Within the last month, since reading FSG, I have read about 10 other books. She is by far my favorite author so far and I find myself going back and re-reading FSG when I am done with other books. I love the characters in this series. They continue to develop into lovable characters throughout the other books as well. Those who HATED book 1, I would encourage to finish and then try to go onto book 2 and 3 because they were by far my favorites. I couldn't put the last two books down. GREAT JOB EL JAMES. I'm hoping to see more of her in the future! And I cannot wait for the movies!
B000ZMCVRI|4.0|The songs sound as good as they ever did.. good stuff. The sound quality is good and they definitely bring back that island-ey feeling..
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It's been a long time since a movie depicted a book so closely. It's a great series of books and a great movie too!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm not really a reader but I started this book and could not put it down. So I read it all in 2 days, which is a record for me. On book 3 right now.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My husband and I have tried most every diet, but this one has actually made us feel better, curbed our hunger, and is true to what Dr, Davis says. Blood sugar is more normal, energy level has increased. If trying to lose weight, though, watch how much you're eating of these delightful foods.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|My husband was struggling with his old earpiece. Everyone was complaining that he sounded as if he were in a tunnel or vacant building-and he was just sitting in his office. This product solved his problem. He said it is comfortable too.
B0080CL0HM|2.0|With the star cast of Uma Thurman and Robert Pattison, had expected more from this movie. Marred with poor script, horrible direction and an aimless storyline...was unable to follow the movie through its end. Do not recommend watching this movie unless you get seriosuly drunk and stoned first.
B003RT0NK8|4.0|I actually liked it, there have been so many made with the idea of rescuing stranded space peoples. The story line was interesting and entertaining. It was a lot better than Event Horizon, but the same idea...
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I found this book very interesting. Having read many of Gregory's books, this one is up to her standards.I find the history and the characters so captivating!
B008M36ER0|4.0|I am not much of a Mel Gibson fan but, this was actually really action packed and a funny, quirky movie to watch. I enjoyed it and did not look at my watch once during the movie..
B008M34INW|5.0|A little unusal movie for mel gibson,however he pulls it off,and makes a very interesting movie.lot of action and his quick personal wit. I enjoyed it.
B004V7FAQW|5.0|Refreshing and pleasant and Robert Plant at his best. The only thing better is his DVD with new wife Patty Griffin and Buddy Miller and Daryl Scott. Awesome music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and I love it!!! But on my kindle I had to look at Pinterest's site on the web. It was ok, but I was just waiting for the awesomeness that I knew an app would bring.<br /><br />Then low and behold?! BAM! Kindle app! So amazing! Easy to use! An excessive pinner's dream come true!<br /><br />Finally glad apps are starting to branch off from just iTunes so they can be used across multiple devices.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|really enjoyed this book in the series.  was well written and flowed well.  lots of ups and downs and you really feel for the characters.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I ordered the movie through Amazon instant streaming.  I must say that I love the convenience factor. That being said, I went into the movie with low expectation.  It exceeded my low expectations, but the plot was predictable.  Overall, it is still a good action movie to watch if you have some free time.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|not as good as the first two.  it reads slower and has a large gap in the action of the book.  overall a good ending to the book and a must read to finish the series.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Fifty shades freed was a wonderful finish to a wonderful series. It had an amazing storyline and was simply thrilling. I found it so hard to put it down. I finished this book really quickly as it was so interesting and moreish
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Quick read. Couldn't put the book down. A must read for all three in the series! I was disappointed when it ended.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|pretty fun i guess. you swerve around hitting mutants. the only downside is that it takes forever to get coins, so they make it easier to buy them than get them in the game. but i guess it was free so what would you expect.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE!! BETTER THEN THE FIRST!! Can't wait for the next one.. A must have... Get the blue ray for the best experience..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read anything that had this many twists and turns and totally surprised me, but this one certainly did!  I highly recommend it!
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Despite the crowds who did like it - I did not care for the Hunger Games. Making a game of violent death for the loser, is not my idea of family entertainment.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Excellent book.  Great plot twists and turns make it a book you can't put down.  Connelly does an amazing job in weaving the past and present together.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|[[ASIN:B007PBKG5G Boys & Girls]]<br />I love this music. Alabama Shakes is my newest favorite group. The entire album is great. I can't wait to hear what comes next!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best love story almost like the notebook just a lot more sex. A must read I have read it 10 times
B008602KQI|5.0|This is an amazing movie that I would recommend to a person of any age. It has amazing actors and stays turn to the book as best as it can. It is an great adaption of the book.(which I would also recommend) All I can say is watch it before you knock it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book I have read it 10 times I can't get enough. I love the love story not all the sex.
B00355L2TU|1.0|This is much too difficult for the average middle aged person.  Way too much getting up and down off the floor,<br /><br />For me Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds is a much more logical choice.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|I've seen the original and second American Pie films, then lost interest in the series. I was in the mood to watch something non-dramatic and funny, and this is exactly what it was. Definitely not on par with Citizen Kane, but that's not what I was looking for! So all in all, I'd recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Have read a lot of books in my limited existence and without exaggeration, I have likely read more books (in number not quality) than most adults ever will. Many \\"great works\\" I tackled when I was between the ages of 13-16. Works by Isaac Asimov, Herman Hess, H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clark, even Beowulf, Deer Born, Catch 22, Brave New World and many others. One of the books I read was Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. It was amazing then but having spent today immersed in the world of Card's future I am left feeling stunned. I began the book this morning with a sense of reminiscent for the child I was when I read the book, gleeful in remembering how well and how quickly I was sucked in to his world. I finished it almost in tears, not for how the story ended but that it did. I feel compelled to write about the experience, the magnitude of emotion and how I have found a new depth to the story. But beyond those words I am simply struck silent. So I ask, if you have never read the book, go pick it up. And if you have, read it again with new eyes and new experiences will color the book a different hue.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|A must-read and a must-read-again! You can't help but fall in love with the characters. So well written and absolutely heartbreaking at times. You are with Katniss through her whole journey and you feel everything.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Was very surprised when reading book. Didn't find it as erotic as everyone made it out to be but actually had a great story line
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has changed my life! Thank you bill Orielly for talking about it on your show on your tip of the day.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I've found HOW TO BE A WOMAN very inspiring and witty, and also VERY funny -weird for an \\"essay\\" about feminism. Hope it will have success, especially among young girls, many of which consider \\"feminism\\" a dated word, and think there is not need to worry about these issues anymore.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|I had to quit on this book.  There is not one sympathetic character, no redemption, nothing beautiful--it is thoroughly parched. It is one of the most depressing books I hace ever read.  Not recommended.
B003B02O14|4.0|This was a great read.  Very inforamtive.  It gave you a insight on the workings of the upper legal system.
0812993292|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  There were a number of pithy, descriptive sentences that still come to mind weeks after finishing the book.<br />I gave it 4 stars because I felt the book was choppy in places, as though the author wasn't sure where she wanted to go. Some parts were were very descriptive, while others were glossed over.  Some scenes had no point and did not advance the story (my opinion). I won't describe them because I don't want to spoil the reading for someone else. By the time I finished, I felt the book could have used a bit more editing.<br />That said, the problems I saw, are the same that can be found in many author's early works. With time and experience, they can be dealt with.<br />I look forward with eagerness to read future works by this author.
B006MOW98E|4.0|I really enjoyed reading these stories.<br />I did start with the second one though, as the reason I got this book was for John Green.<br />His writing is great as ever.<br />However first story was my favourite I think.<br />And unfortunately I did skimmed through the 3rd one, it just didn't hold my interest.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The book is boring and dull; if you need to take a nap, start reading this book! Dull, dull, dull, dull, dull,
B006OOHYIC|3.0|I also have the first one. its the same. not really understanding why some reviewers rave over the improvements that aren't there. gameplay is fine if you like these puzzles, but I didn't need a copy so I uninstalled
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I just knew this was going to be the free app of the day soon because the original quell had already been one. Yay! I love Amazon!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. If you like the movie you'll love the book and vis versa. Very good story line and I look forward to reading the rest of the series. :)
B000ICXQGK|5.0|I had seen this movie a few years ago and decided it was one that I wanted to own. I am an artist, I've had good reasons for depression in my life, and I've had a husband who adored me before he died.  The idea of a reunion after life is comforting.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Too many commercials though. I love to play every single day though!! I can't get enough of it!! I even bought the full edition and love it! No ads there.!!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|This is what pop music is meant to be. Infectiously catchy, creative, and diverse. From start to finish the upcoming Imagine Dragons album, Night Visions, is a radio-friendly work of art. While the group pays tribute to an undeniably 80′s electronic sound they do so without feeling cheesy or dated. Their indelible hooks look to already be leading them to commercial success. Most recently the track Radioactive has been featured in commercials for a new television series.<br /><br />The album features several songs that were release earlier this year on the groups Continued Silence EP. This includes the album's opener, It's Time, which has been receiving radio play since it's release. It serves as a strong introduction to any new comers to the world of Imagine Dragons. Tiptoe follows next with the most obvious hat-tip to the aforementioned 80′s vibe. Once you bounce your way through the driving bass of Radioactive you'll find yourself at Demons; A thoroughly modern track in the vein of what you might hear from a group like OneRepublic. As the album continues it explores an unbelievably diverse set of styles ranging from world music to r&b. There is truly not a single track of filler on Night Visions
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This was a good to book to read- It makes me interested to see what the series on HBO is all about. I would not recommend for teens.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Downloaded this thinking it was like the other Solitaire games. Mistake! It is annoyingly full of advertising. Had to Uninstall it. Don't bother.
B00846REIS|2.0|Not much to say except that this book is a total rip off of Fifty Shades of Grey. I was very disappointed.
B008602KQI|5.0|For those Hunger Game readers, this is a must see film, though their are some part of the story cut from the film, it is still worth the $$$
B008602KQI|4.0|if you hadn't read the books before you saw this movie, you probably had no idea what was going on sometimes. the momentary flashbacks, her sitting in the rain while peta threw her burnt bread, etc. those were probably really strange to some of you. i LOOOOVED the books, the movie was okay by hollywood standards, but it just does not do the books justice. i will watch the other two, but i am not expecting magic. please, read the books, then watch it. it will help.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was captivated from the first few pages until the end. I was left wanting more, and I will definitely read it again, knowing that I will learn something new.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I thought the Star Trek remake was excellent. Chris Pine was very good as Kirk, Zoe Saldana was very good and the person who played Spock was excellent.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This may be my favorite novel of 2012 so far. A beautiful well-written story that i couldn't put down. Its been a long time since i have been so moved by a book, it brought me to tears on occasion and had me thinking about the characters for a long time after i finished the book.<br />Its a such a unique take on a familiar theme that is very thought-provoking.<br />Enjoy :-)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Expected more training scenes, more excitement.  Not as the trailers made it out to be. Maybe I expected more because of all the verbal raves also.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I was really excited to begin another series by Ken Follett. I loved Pillars of the Earth and was hoping this would live up to it, and it did. I found myself unable to put the book down at first, then towards the end I was reading slower so I wouldn't have to finish it! I'm a big fan of historical fiction and I'm looking forward to reading the next book- just not paying $20 for a Kindle book! I will wait for the price to go down before buying the second in the trilogy.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|The Cosmonaut capacitative stylus is the best stylus yet! I've gone through several different cheaper styluses and none of them moved as smoothly  across my kindle fire as the Cosmonaut does. Excellent quailty,nice weight and grip. Perfect for note taking,drawing or just keeping the screen clean of fingerprints and streaks. So worth the money!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome series! I cannot wait to see if she does a series from Christian's point of view. Possibly a movie???
B0086DBE62|4.0|Great movie.  Good for the whole family.  Very funny and imaginative.  Julia Roberts was fantastic in this movie.  Would recommend to anyone.
B008MEM24S|4.0|if your a Phineas and ferb fan, you should DEFINATLY get this game! don't get the free version, it barely has any levels. trust me, you wont regret getting this app!
B008602KQI|5.0|The blu ray dvd set is excellent.  The extras disk is worth the price alone.  If your fan of the movie get this product.
B001TODCII|5.0|The movie is awesome and in great condition. Its a great movie and I love the story about it. What a parent (a loving one) wouldn't do for his or her child?
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|CD was obviously a second. No tamper tape on the top and worse of all: THE CASE WAS BROKEN!!! The bottom hinge was cut off...a clear sign of a second as it was not in the repackaged shrink wrap so it was broken before the sender had it ready for sale...AND WAS NOT DISCLOSED! It's cut of perfectly...to perfect for plastic to break.<br /><br />This breakage makes the cd miserable to open as it comes apart every time you go to open it...it just falls apart in your hands.<br /><br />Very unhappy...and that's just the case. I haven't had the chance to hear the cd. Looks ok...it'd BETTER play perfectly!! I can deal with the case because once I put it on my iPod I'll just file the actual cd...but if there is anything wrong with it...I will ask for a refund!<br /><br />IF YOU'RE GONNA SELL BROKEN PACKAGING: DECLARE IT!
B004OC07F8|5.0|Blue Ocean Strategy is an outstanding book for any executive who's looking for a way to significantly improve his or her company's bottom line.  It's amazing to me how simplistic the ideas are to put in place.  Yes, you have to be daring, but the rewards are well worth the risk.  I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Bob Sproull
B0027MJU00|3.0|The plot does not keep your interest at the intensity level that \\"Gone Girl\\" did. A tedious read. Good charecter development, though.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I mainly started reading this book because of the hype and media coverage it was receiving. I didn't want to miss out when everyone was discussing it! But here I am over a month later and only half way finished reading and I have no desire to pick it back up and finish. I'm sure I will just because I hate not to finish something I started but I'm very bored with the story. The characters seem shallow and the story line seems repetitive. I'm tired of reading about Mr. Grey's grey eyes and how Anastasia's blood is rushing \\"down there\\"!
B008XBHBX2|2.0|I remember Jaws as a much more vivid movie than the badly faded version that streamed to my HDTV from Amazon.  I couldn't bear to watch the whole thing.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|This book is one of a kind. It really shows how wrong we are about our concepts concerning intelligence, education, and how, most of the times, we don't listen to our trully passions. This book may surely change your mind in many ways.<br />It's a must to ANYONE but I specially recommend it to teachers (or anyone involved in education) and parents.
B008602KQI|5.0|Needless to say, Hunger Games is a great film. That's why we bought the DVD. However, the extra bonus features on the second DVD, that include making of the film, interviews with upcoming young actors (priceless), director, producer, dressers, behind the special effects and commentary were really awesome! Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This is by far their best work yet, the lyrics and song style are more personal and tell great stories. Of course having Maria as lead vocals doesnt hurt either. She is the sexiest female vocalist and the most talented I have seen in rock. I love this album.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Lockup was action packed from beginning to end. Director, Luc Besson does a great job showing life in space. Guy Pearce has come a long way from Pricilla, Queen of the Dessert and has remained as funny as ever.
030758836X|4.0|Great book!  This is a very well written book with twists and turns to keep you reading.  I will read more books by this author.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|A good movie, which captures part of what the book is about.  Plays down the love triangle between Gale, Katniss and Petta.  Plays down some of the politics as well.  Over all, though a good few hours of entertainment.
B004RLO0EA|5.0|it is great. the music is all clear there is no extra noise and it sounds just like it came out of the movie
B007SGM084|1.0|I'd like to know what this woman was thinking when she wrote this, does she let her husband speak to her like that! Does she think this book is sexy because its not! If I hadn't bought all three on my kindle I would have thrown the book! Wish I would have never bought them!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|if you enjoyed the first sherlock holmes movie your sure to enjoy this one just as much. it definitely keeps you on your toes and edge of seat.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Kids have really enjoyed this movie. It streamed wonderfully. Nearly as good as watching the Blu-Ray. The only disadvantage being you have neither extras nor subtitles. Movie added a lot the book glossed over adding depth to the characters missing in the book. In some ways the movie was better, in other the book was better. Combined they are wonderful. Suggest reading before watching.
B000HF6XKO|5.0|If you think of the USA's oil consumption as an addiction, like a drug addiction, then this convoluted, but decent, movie begins to make sense. Addicts use all kinds of rationalizations to defer the spotlight from their bad behavior. That's how this multi-plotted film plays out. Several story threads ultimately come together in a somewhat grey tale of corruption, at both the corporate and the government levels. This is a moral tale about how far down the dark path the country has gone to feed its addiction to oil, as a nation with only a small fraction of the globe's population, but a huge percentage of global oil consumption. George Clooney does well here, and I usually don't like Hollywood message movies.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Great fantasy and enjoyable fiction.  The series is long but enjoyable.  The characters are a little difficult to keep track of if you do not read the book through quickly.  I kept forgetting who was who and related to whom. I keep seeing the present world in the story.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I was curious about the \\"forbidden love\\" which is the reason I purchased Slammed - that and the incredible price. I fell in love with all the characters and wanted to know more about them. The story was so entertaining. It's an easy read but I didn't want it to end. I was so glad there was another book to read right away.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a world-class reviewer by any means but I LOVED this book!  First of all, Ana's Goddess is hilarious.  Always ripe and ready to go dispite what Ana herself might be thinking. A wonderful love story full of passion and erotica, my only wish is that Ana would have been a little more eager to explore the Red Room.  But the auther really gave us a great sense of the passion and love between Christian and Ana.  Funny at times, sexy and just plain titillating fun!
B0091XRL86|4.0|Love clay-motion  movies, Wallace and Gromit being one of my favorites, but this one, I do not know, the story line and the plot of the story just doesn't quite do it for me, still very entertaining for my kids.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is the first novel I've read in years where I didn't see the twist coming. It had me second guessing with every turn of the page. Complicated characters, I had a love hate relationship with them all, and couldn't put it down.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie is great! I wish that it had a few more details from the book that I thought were important, but it was still a great movie!
B004I744AS|5.0|I have three dictionary apps and this app is by far the easiest to use.  Don't need to say the other apps will be deleted.
B005R2PDL2|5.0|Put this on my Kindle, ipod, and itunes.  So I can access something calming and beautiful any time.  Even this is an old album, it is ageless.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Not what I was expecting from the title, But somebody says never judge a anything by it's title. Very heartwarming and entertaining. Also, a true story. that would blow some people's minds. Very good movie.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I got YouBible for use on my Windows Mobile phone.  It is the only app that does well on Windows Mobile 7 and up that is also free.  It is very powerful, has multiple Bible translations, lots of resources, and audio versions as well as text versions. Overall it is really cool.<br />My one complaint is that YouBible only works while on-line. The Windows Mobile version does not yet have an off-line version.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The 2nd and 3rd books in this series were major disappointments.  They followed the same plot as the first, and the characters remained undeveloped and the story line was boring to continue reading.  I'm disappointed I bought these.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. Harold's pilgrimage became mine as I was able to feel his pain, his doubts, his exhaustion. Take this journey with Harold and you will look at the simplest things a little differently.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|I should have know that this movie was going to be so bad. Action was terrible. Story was terrible. Only good actors were the bad brothers. Guy Pierce seemed like he was doing a bad impersonation of Mark Wahlberg.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|fun and challenging app without being boring. Really makes you think of a strategy for the solution.Five stars is the perfect scoring for this game
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Love these movies, they are all good! I love the anciton as well as all the humor. The graphics ar so cute as well.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie was really AWESOME!  I do understand why there was a lot of the book left out.  If a viewer has not read the book they will not get everything that went on in the movie.  Read the book first, then watch the movie.
B005DOJ68K|4.0|CCR's Chronicle: 20 Greatest Hits is truly that... the greatest hits CCR ever produced all in one wrapper.  If you like CCR, you will LOVE Chronicle.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|The writer's life was most certainly stolen from her, and this comes through loud and clear when reading this book. It is like hearing the story from a child, as she never had a chance to mature as in a normal life. Her comments and thoughts in particular towards the end of her book make you realize that at the end of her ordeal, she is just starting to grow up. This read was a real insight into how the mind develops and copes with a life as a captive. This woman went through a lot, and I am glad she decided to write her book. I hope it helps her keep the pain in the past and she can continue to grow into the woman she was meant to be.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|This is still one of my favourite albums of all time. And for $5? Done! Love my Amazon MP3 app too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love Printest! Loads of new and exciting information that I've acquired. Great having a vitual pinboard that I can access at anytime of day or night.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the game because it is challenging and fun.  I play it when ever I can find free time.
B001GJ7E9E|4.0|The thing that makes Mr & Mrs Smith work for me are the two lead actors, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film lags when these two are not on screen because of the energy and fun they seem to having while filming. The rest of the cast is not given much to do, except for Adam Brody, who manages to make his brief moments on screen stand out. I particulary enjoy the moment he and the two stars are in the same scene.<br /><br />Are there flaws, of course, because lets face it, the script is not that great, and there aren't too many actors who could make it work at all. Doug Limon as the director manages to do some nice turns with the filming, and gosh only knows it the best thing, I've seen from him since The Bourne Identity. I won't talk about the mind-boggling awful Jumper film.
B00355L2TU|4.0|This is definitely not an easy workout, but it is definitely effective. This is a great workout for a busy schedule. It's only 20 minutes, but it's 20 minutes of non-stop excercising. I'm never able to keep up with it for 30 days in a row, but I definitely notice a difference in my strength, stamina, and weight loss.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a movie that grabs you from the beginning and never lets go.  It very much keeps to the book which  was very popular like the Twilight and Harry Potter books and anything that gets young people to read is a great thing.  Do yourself a favor and get this dvd and if you haven't read the books, I would do that before seeing the movies.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Long but well worth the time it takes.  It drags a little in the middle but the premise and how Mr. King handles it is very entertaining and thought provoking.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I didn't want to like it, but I really enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it yet... you should! What are you waiting for?!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Flipboard came pre-installed on my phone, and I was psyched to see it available for the Kindle Fire.  Nice product, you can personalize it so that you get the type of news you want.  I like it.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|I read a lot of bad press about this movie and I guess a lot of people gave up on it somewhere along the line.  I guess the studio spent too much to make it. However, I found it to be a good movie that the whole movie can watch!  Leans more toward a teenage/kid audience rather than an adult audience. Worth renting!
B008602KQI|4.0|I read all three books in the series and waited so long for the movie......it didnt deliver. I mean i loved the movie dont get me wrong, but i expected more......maybe with the sequel?  A definite must see, just be prepared if u read the book that u of course will be a bit disappointed.
B008M36ER0|4.0|Mel Gibson is excellent in this movie.  He's a flawed character in this movie and he plays it perfectly!  Worthy rental!
B007STBUIW|5.0|I don't remember seeing Jaws or even Jaws 2 in theatres.  The first Jaws movie I remember seeing in theatres was the horrid Jaws 3.  Anyway, the excellent transfer on this movie has to be seen to be believed.  I can tell that Universal spared no expense in restoring this movie.  It was worth it.  I really hope this movie continues to attract audiences, both new and old.  Believe it or not, Jaws still reminds me that shark attacks can and will happen and nobody is immune, not even Quint.  I will never forget his last stand when he met his match with the great white shark.  That scene makes me cringe every time I watch it.  I admire the painstaking effort of the cast and crew that went into the making of this movie and I especially applaud Steven Spielberg for sticking his neck out and making movies like this one and Saving Private Ryan.  This movie was the first summer blockbuster and it's in a league of its own.  Kudos to Universal for releasing such a mint copy of the film with extra features.  Happy Camper here.
B007VYBFA2|5.0|I have never been disappointed with any Vampire Diaries shows...  PLUS!  All of my purchases on here have been top notch!  No complaints about Amazon or Vampire Diaries!  :)
B006CBSE86|5.0|This is by far my favorite Nightwish album! There is not a song I don't like and I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the first part of the movie on a trip to Washington. I had to stop because of the landing.<br />As my Kindle touch arrived home, I first finished the book I was reading on my iPad and I bought then the Trilogy. It's like it became a drug. I couldn't drop it for almost 10 days. It's a great story; with great characters very well build. The surroundings even if fictive sound very real.<br />Just a warning, don't start if you don't have time to finish, you'll however be glued on it ! ;-)
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Highly recommended movie for any family and kids great movie during the holiday season.! this will get all the kids in the spirit of Christmas!
B003SPCYP8|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie. Although some parts were a little unrealistic, overall it was a great movie. Definitely a must see movie for the family and it will emphasize tolerance and forgiveness.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|Somehow Michelle Williams managed to capture the magnetic draw that Marilyn had. I kept wanting to watch her and felt like I was seeing the real Marilyn.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great show, I really enjoyed, the book is always better, but still a very good show. J.Lawrence is totally awesome!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Solid style, quick pace, and details when you really want them. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Fantasy or Scifi.
B000TETLPC|3.0|By far not their best album but it was pretty good. A little too mellow for my taste. I guess I was looking for a more raspy sound.
B008KP6ENE|2.0|This is a good game for people who have bad taste in games. Over all, I do not recommend this game for anyone but little kids would maybe like it s little bit.
B0030DD9I4|4.0|Eminem is still one of the best rappers out there. His quirky rhymes and good stories will keep you listening for hours, but this album fell a little short with the heavy use of accents. The lyrics were there but the accents make you not want to listen to this album over a long period of time. If it wasn't for the accents I would've given it 5 stars.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|I think this movie is very well done it really represent well the message Dr. Seuss was communicating in his book. After watching the movie my little girl wants to plant trees all over our yard.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|My son and I loved it! Has to be a good movie to keep his attention considering that he's only 3. He loved everything about it especially the drumming!
B007KOYEOC|1.0|It is full of domestic violence, patriarchy, heteronormativity and takes the wins women have gained back 100 years, total, TOTAL RUBBISH!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Going into reading this book I expected some behind the scenes stuff on how the raid went down. While there are details I did expect a little more.<br /><br />Interesting is that the details in this book contradicts some of the leaked info: when they found out who the target wadbeing a big one.<br /><br />Ive been fascinated with 9/11 and everything that's gone into it. This is another good book to add to my collection.<br /><br />There really is no secrets revealed; the media has done more damage by releasing the SEALS name.<br /><br />If the government really didn't want this out, it wouldn't be.......<br /><br />Good read that I finished in about 10 hrs.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Loads of fun and can be played for by all ages.  Games are made from easy to hard. Just have fun and do the ones you want.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site! It has a lot of great things on here to many to list. I'm addicted! I would recommend this site to anyone and everyone!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My kids and I love this movie, and I was very happy to get a digital copy so I don't have to worry about scratched DVDs. The Lorax was one of my very favorite books growing up. I loved hearing about the mysterious Onceler with the green gloves who talked through a \\"snergely hose\\", and the brave Lorax who speaks for the trees. To see some of the back story was so much fun, and to actually see who the Onceler was and how he ended up all alone with his buildings falling apart was fun...and sad. I think the story is even sadder when you know more about the Onceler, and see him making friends with the brown barbaloots and the swammee swans, and then cold-heartedly ruining their world because of his greed.<br /><br />When we saw this movie in the theater, we walked out and saw overflowing trash cans with popcorn and soda cups all over the floor. That really brought the point of the story home for me. On the way home, my daughter and I talked about how we could avoid making more trash, and what we can do to clean up the earth (recycling, composting, reusing). We are all Oncelers, and we can all make the choice to make the world better...or not.<br /><br />Great story, great movie, timeless message.
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|This was a very cute movie! Lots of great stars in it and great twists & plot. I was happy to see there were emotional parts and funny parts to the movie. Definatly a good watch!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a great game, as everyone already knew from their iOS experiences.  But while I might not be the largest fan of the mostly hands-off approach of many 'endless runner' style games, this is one of the most complex and addictive.  Mostly due to the artstyle and control; these are absolutely sublime in execution.<br /><br />But I found myself wanting in the depth department.  A manual run/control option, along with different worlds/facilities and obstacles that varied a bit more.  Maybe different enemies and a shorter, more level style advance as an option to the main game.  It would definately give this game more legitimacy amongst \\"true gamers\\", and more playability for those who do appreciate the endless runner genre.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked Jetpack Joyride; I was caught off-guard with how much I enjoyed playing this game, considering how unimpressed I've been with runners so far - but also wishing that there was more to do here than just get a High Score.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I live the pinterest ap! I've been waiting for it to come to the kindle and it did not disappoint! If you are a fan of pinterest get it!
B004UID2LC|2.0|downloaded it for my kindle fire and it works but after videos finish playing it frequently has error reports and shuts down.  I deleted it and downloaded again so it seems to have issues with Kindle Fire's system. It would be 4-5 stars if it worked consistently!
B0040JBAMY|5.0|This is a fantastic Album with all of the classic Queen tunes you have grown up loving. It is a must own.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|It just didn't have that epic feel to it although it did try. I've seen better done on a smaller budget
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Very Happy with my purchase of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. Will Purchase from Amazon again!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I highly recommend this story, it is a good blend of humor, truth, and inspiration.  As a woman in her late 20s I could really identify with Cheryl.  The style of her writing is casual and easy to read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two had me fully involved with Ana's and Christian's dynamic relationship and I really enjoyed the twists and turns throughout.  I'm already done with book three and wish there were fifty more shades!  I'm really bummed to be finished and am trying to figure out what else I should read that will hold my attention as well as the trilogy did.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved the pillars of the earth and has high expectations about this one. Though is not as good as his prequel, the book is awesome: full of historic notes and a marvelous description of the life in the middle age. The hundred years war and the black plague are the two events around which the author develops his characters. Impossible to read if you haven't read the pillars of the earth.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I was thankful to be able to watch season 4 so quickly since it didn't come out on DVD way later.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the book and found it intriguing.  I did feel a bit manipulated by the author as the story grew to its conclusion.
B008HI7BMW|4.0|The soundtrack, although missing what The Dark Knight soundtrack had, can best be described as solid.  It captures the exhilarating feel of the film.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Great vignettes that highlight the message.  Very practical and real-life advice.  Great for marketers - especially of abstract ideas and concepts.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|As usual, an action packed adventure.<br /><br />Great to see that Reacher is not slowing down with age.<br /><br />Would be nice to see one of these novels set in a major city for a change, but it is hard to argue with the US backblocks depicted in most of these novels.<br /><br />I read it in 2 sittings, and cant wait for the next adventure.<br /><br />Rob.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read a lot.  Was into this book from the beginning.  Great entertainment and hoping for a great movie too.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|One of my favorite t.v. series, I love all the characters and there scenerios. I hope this series continues to go on with this great comedey !
B008IYR2BA|4.0|This was a great season of dexter, it kept me guessing all the way to the end.  I am only giving it 4 and not 5 stars because the ending was a little disappointed at the ending to this season, but overall great season.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I love this book!  I am having trouble putting it down to do my \\"chores.\\"  I am really excited to know that one of the books in the Cousins series is being made into a BBC production.  Thanks Philippa for writing such enthralling books.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I didn't mind reading it, but it didn't advance the plot much. It would have been just as satisfying to read a summary of what happened. For this reason, I will not be reading the next book in the series. One thing did bother me. I saw a quote from the second season on the show that mentioned things that have not happened yet in this book.<br />I think this shows that the editor/producer of the show knows that the book is boring and has just started taking the interesting parts of the next book(s).<br />The other thing that bothered me was with all the switching around of the POV for each chapter, by the time it got back to that character, I had forgotten what was happening to them and didn't really care too much.<br />Basically these books read more like a history instead of a story where you empathize with one or two main characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Despite a lot of people saying that this trilogy is not worth being on any bestseller list, I thought it was a great story told by a very talented author. Not only are the characters very well developed, the story is also gripping, shocking, and romantic at the same time. Yes, there were times when I was surprised and a little shocked about THAT much detail, but those who don't like to read this can just put the book down and read a different one. I really didn't mind it and I loved the story, because Ana's reaction to many things was very much the way that I would have reacted to some issues that she was facing in the story.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed is a great finish to an amazing trilogy with a little more action than the first two books, and I think that such a trilogy deserves being a bestseller just because of the fact that the author ventured out there and wrote down all there is to this story with nothing left out for the viewer to guess.<br /><br />I just finished reading this book and am burning to read the same story again through Christian's view. Thank you, E.L. James for an amazing story, told with such love for writing and character development. I am eagerly awaiting more.
B008602KQI|3.0|Was looking forward to the movie because of all the hype but was very dissapointed when i finally got a chance to watch it, had a hard time staying involved
B0014EU5XI|5.0|How can it be bad it's zztop it's an awesome sound that will never loose it's appeal. It has all of the best hits
B008M36EEI|4.0|Very enjoyable movie.  Except for one very small bedroom scene, good for the family.  That makes it PG 13.<br />Pleasant story. Good acting. All around very nice.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is the second novel of the Millennium trilogy. (Do not read out of order) It is an excellent book and I couldn't put it down-just as I couldn't with the other books in this trilogy.  In this book, the reader is able to see Lisbeth try to change herself for the better, physically and emotionally through her experiences traveling. When she goes home to Sweden she is in for a surprise.  Lisbeth's past is revealed to the reader in this novel, her traumas, her family, her friends, which gives the reader insight about her character flaws and and how she ended up the Lisbeth that readers love.  We see Lisbeth's mathematical mind in this novel,we get to know her and understand her a little bit more.  We also see her as she attempts clean up all the childhood messes in her life in order to move on to a more adult life. I would however recommend buying all three books in a package deal, I ended up buying each one individually and paid a little more. But this book is an excellent book, do not overlook this one!
B0090EJR1K|2.0|I rented this movie because I thought the trailer was funny.  Turns out, the humor was very crude and in my opinion, even over the line.  I ended up turning it off half way through the film, and I honestly can't remember the last time I did that.  I have never written a movie review, but found this film to be so disappointing in its lack of substance that I feel compelled to tell others.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge of your set and constantly guessing, if your looking for a hot new book, you should definitely give this a go!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm definitely going to keep asking for suggestions from her! This was one of the best books I've read in a while. The kind you can't wait to pick up and keep reading. The story is so well written, with lots of twists, it will keep you on your toes until the very end!
B000062V9C|4.0|I was really having trouble finding this dvd - it was a great price,condition was good and it came very fast. My grandkids are excited.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I picked up this book after reading a very dramatic story, and it was just what I needed! A fun story that reads quickly!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Love this movie. Every time I watch it, it's like watching it the first time. The never-ending love story of Jane Austen's characters :)
B0088WGBC8|5.0|My wife an i rented the movie to watch. We had no problem watching the movie when it was down streaming. The movie had an great picture during the whole movie.
B002ZG999U|4.0|This is a must have if you grew up or enjoyed any of the 80's action movies, that's the bottom line.<br /><br />I won't do much of a review as there are plenty of others, but I will say this movie delivers exceptionally on every facet that you'd expect in an action movie of this style. You might not have Shakespearean acting, or a lot of depth, but a few of the guys do deliver well - the others kind of stick out. lol I've actually purchased this movie three times now, on DVD for under $10 it has made an awesome gift.  I know everybody seems to be moving on to BluRay (I even have a blu ray player and a large 1080p LCD), but I still find myself buying DVD's based on their tremendous value lately. Anyways, this is a great movie and a great deal for us that still enjoy some physical media.
B007SGM084|4.0|This series is sorta like a \\"smutty\\" romance novel.  If you can get past the smutt its a good read.  If you read to the end you will find out why Christian is the way he is. I read almost any kind of book except gross horror stuff, and i enjoyed this series.<br /><br />Laters, baby
B006LSZECO|3.0|I like the story line, but it takes for ever to get to the plot of the story..way to much time spent on Introduction to the the characters, dont no if i will read another one of her books!! boo.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I enjoyed the series as a whole. I felt the story lines were heart warming, relatable, exciting and interesting. I wanted to see where their lives went and how things developed for them. I read the series quickly to keep up with the adventures. I would recommend it to others.
B008N1V11U|3.0|This game has a lot of potential to be great. The Dark Knight Rises has a fantastic plot, and Batman is always a cool character to base a game around, but it misses the mark in so many simple ways.  First of all, the controls for the vehicles are awful, they don't handle well, and don't necessarily turn the direction you're pulling the d stick. The lagging can be atrocious, and has messed up a number of fights.<br /><br />The worst problem though, is crashing, I'll be going around, saving Gotham from Bane, and the game will just... stop. No more Batman for you. It either takes me back to the home screen of my Kindle, or (even worse) just freezes and forces me to do a reset of the whole machine.<br /><br />This is such a disappointing game, because its so much fun otherwise, but the issues with it outweigh the benefits, and I've stopped playing it entirely. What a waste of time.
B008602KQI|1.0|I have to say I was quite disappointed. Went I pre ordered it was my assumption the movie would be at my house the day of release. Saturday. No I had to call Amazon to get the release so it would be adopted to my house. I could have bought the minute from Wall mart 5 days before I received it at my house. As you can tell, it may be a while before I order from Amazon again. And of this is how pre orders go. I am not going to do out again new
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Erotic and sex laden, but beyond that, there was not much in the way of a story. I kept thinking surely this book is going somewhere with all this but it never did and left me thinking it was a dud.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie leaves a lot to be desired. Had I not started to listen to the book on tape, I believe I would have been lost as to what was going on. I gave it four stars for the quality of the blueray disc presentation.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|When I downloaded this game, I expected to be able to play for fun but it wants too much personal information for comfort on a game.  Sorry, this one has been deleted.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Book was tough to follow because was supposed to be written by a 9th grader. It wasn't a bad book just really not one of my favorites.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have seen Les Miserable three times in London and I seem to appreciate it more each time but I can't always get to London as often as I would like so when I need my Les Mis fix I put in this DVD.  Alfie Boe is the best JVJ and I hope to see him in San Francisco in Oct.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Excellent story, great plot. Is it too good to be true? Layken, the protagenist of the story meets her handsome neighbor (Will) as she moves into the house across the street. They are instantly attracted to one another, but as fate would have it, a one huge obstacle that stands in the way. They must ask themselves how can something that feels so right be so wrong??????
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|After waiting forever, this game is hours of fun and just amazing.  Can't stop playing it! Normally I don't like games where you always lose but not Jetpack Joyride! GET IT!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Having seen the play about four times, I felt that it was time to read the book, but not in the original French.  The book is interesting and so far does veer from the play.  However, I am sure that is poetic licence and that further on in the book,there will be many simiarities between the book (English translation)and the play.  So far, the book is excelent.
B008602KQI|5.0|My husband rates this one a 5 star. Love this movie. I know it portrays violence in children but there is more to it if you look beyond the violence. Cinematopography is outstanding. Picked a wonderful location. I've read all the books and yes compared but the movie had it's own twist on it. This is one i don't regret watching. Can't wait to see what he does with the other two
B008602KQI|5.0|i saw this in the movies whem it first came came<br />I ordered it as  soon as it was put on advance Amazon dvd<br />I haven't<br /> been dissapointed  each time I watch it is just as good as the first time<br />The character acting is great
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I already have an eBay account.  I already have small stock of items I am selling. chinabear777.<br />So it was only natural to get this app. Now I can track and keep up with what I am selling, watching, buying on eBay.<br /> It is also so simple to list an item using eBay mobile.  With this app I can take a photo, then simply list it.<br />I have not experienced any issue with this app.  Bidding is also much easier with this app.  I highly recommend this eBay app.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This novel requires that you suspend all disbelief.  Why any husband would love this woman is more of a mystery than the book itself! The ending was so far fetched I was sorry I invested the time it took to read it. I was very disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. I wish I had a C. Grey ;) After reading it, I couldn't resist purchasing the other two. Thumbs up E.L. James!!!!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great Adaptation of the book.  Loved it!!!! I recommend this movie to all age groups.  If you enjoyed the books you will like how they made the movie make sense without including all of the information.
B001ISZYKY|1.0|WHY???????  Adam Lambert is better but to produce an album under the name Queen is an afront to the memory of the man who made them and to the bassist who came up with #1 songs - Freddie Mercury and John Deacon.  As Smile, they weren't going far even though they had talent they did not have \\"it all\\".  They certainly fall short with Paul Rogers.  I would buy an Adam Lambert/Queen---The Show Must Go On (or something showing NOT ORIGINAL QUEEN instead of just a +) album but it should be named very differently since 50 percent of Queen has been missing since the last album and one performance.  I feel May and Taylor should continue their music...just don't put the \\"extras\\" in the same category with the stuff with Freddie and John without a significantly distinct alteration in the name of the group.<br /><br />I don't know about others but as a PURIST Queen fan, Brian should take care to rename the group in such a way that the \\"name recognition\\" was there but honor/memory should be given to John Deacon and Freddie Mercury.  It would be simple to title it:<br />The Show Must Go On:  Queen.  People would still give credit and name recognition to Queen but \\"The Show Must Go On\\" would recognize those who were no longer there but gave so much to make them who they turned out to be as a band.  (On a side-note, Roger's song for Freddie should be included in an Queen Alternative Album as well as Brian's.  Both are excellent.  I just happen to enjoy Roger's more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it<br />best ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever forever
B007KZY1YY|5.0|It's one of the best written books ever. The kind that stops from going out just to finish it! Makes it difficult to switch to other books.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have only read about a third of this book and am not sure if I will be able to finish it.  I assume somewhere there is a plot or story other than Christian and Ana having sex. I can't imagine 3 books on what I have read so far.  If there is a plot or story here I think it should surface before this far into the book.  If people are reading this book just for the sex description's etc.. I think they would be better off spending their time examining their own sex life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! It was a real page turner and something I would read again in the future!
B003RT0NK8|3.0|The science was beyond my suspension of disbelief, as too was the lack of discipline of the crew to carry on with, what was presented as, a must succeed endeavor.
B0060D15AK|5.0|This was the best movie I have watch this year I love Sandra  - as an actress and this is one of her best!!  The story line is quick moving, funny and true of corporate amercia life in NYC!!. I have watch 6X's  - you must watch!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie, especially after reading the books.  I like having the digital copy too. I was able to download it onto my iPad and can watch it on the go.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This Book took me by surprise! I never thought I would get so into a book I have to make myself put it down. The story behind all the  \\"more\\" issues is such a good live story!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Everyone loves this classic game! I play this game for hours. Have friends come over and we all play. Its a really good game and glad I have it.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|great album.  this band hasn't' let me down yet.  great mix of true country and southern rock.  i recommend this album to any fan of true rock n roll!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I believe this is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Kudos to the author.  Hope there wil be a movie or two.
B0057UAE54|5.0|This is a must own for any true music lover. Some serious guitar here. Also, $3 cheaper then on itunes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is easily one of the greatest books I ever read. I could NOT put it DOWN! I loved it! I was enthralled and I will read it again before the movie comes out!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie follows the plot presented in the book rather well.  One needs to eventually have the movies for all three books in the series (a la Lord of the Rings) to have the complete story with the great, but still \\"dark\\" ending.  I hope the next two movies are at least as well done as this one.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|A bit rambling with the introduction of new characters.  As other reviewers have noted, it has grown more difficult to separate the story lines in these later books.  Overall the book maintains the richness and attraction of the previous books, it is just not as well put together and has too many characters.  It is hard to read and maintain focus over more than an hour or two.
B00136Q342|5.0|Johnny Cash is one of the alltime greats, a must have!  His music will span generations to come.  I would recommend this album to anyone.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Stardust is, I guess, a kind of fable, but it's hard to pin down.  Regardless, it's wonderful offbeat entertainment that will occasionally make you laugh out loud and leave you smiling.
1416972250|5.0|From Tween 2 Teen Book Reviews:<br /><br />I read this book for the first time about one year ago. I loved every second of it. Then I read it again. I love this book inside and out. And the series as a whole is one of my favorites. This is the book in the series where you really figure out what's going on. The bad guys are explained, and you find out big secrets about the characters. So it's one book you just can't miss.<br /><br />  The main character is Clary Fray. There are so many words I could use to describe her. She is strong, independent, amazing, powerful, dedicated, loyal, caring, stubborn. The list goes on and on. She's a well developed character that everyone is able to relate to. Not to mention she can kick demon butt. And by this point, she's starting to realize just how awesome she is. Then there's Jace. He is the male lead. He is actually a lot like Clary. The only difference, he may be more stubborn. He's not afraid to risk his life, which makes him a little reckless at times. It worries the heck out of the other characters, but makes readers fall in love with him. He is not the least bit modest. He is completely aware of his hotness, and often brings it up. He has a witty comment for everything. He'll have you laughing out loud at almost everything he says. He acts like an idiot at times, but all teenage boys do.<br /><br />  The plot twists and turns. Just as it looks like someone is good, they do something evil. Someone evil might turn out to be good. And of course there are the characters no one is sure if they're good or not. If you are looking to read this book, be ready for one heck of a ride. I give this book five stars.
B008602KQI|4.0|I only give film 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the book is so much more interesting.  The film's production quality is excellent and it may be impossible to fully realize the book's story because we don't really get inside the heads of the characters.  I am a new fan of the lead actress, but some of the other casting left me wanting someone else in the role.  Woody Harrelson is great, despite me thinking he was wrong for the part when hearing of the casting.  Stanly Tucci is always good but he wasn't given enough to do here.  I still don't think that Lennny Kravitz should have been cast in his role.  He is good, but the role called for much more.  I think my biggest complaint was the realization of the world itself.  Capital City was a complete disaster compared to the book and the costume designer and make-up team had such a so m  uch to work with, yet they stumbled.  Effie was a hot mess and most of the characters of Capital City lacked a look that matched the books descriptions.  I realize it may not be fair to compare a film to a book, but this is one of the simpler things to deal with and I was almost angry given the canvas the artists were given and the complete \\"safety\\" and boring imagination of the teams who were to give the world and it's people the proper \\"look\\".  I give the wardrobe and make-up department 1 STAR because it was so bad (to me) that it drew me out of the story.  One thing that I did love was camouflage of PETA. Very cool.  Overall, I enjoyed the film, but was disappointed because I wanted to love it as much as I loved the series of books.  Looking forward to the next one.  Hopefully they will hire a new team but, unfortunately, probably not.  They will have even more to work with on the second one.  I would recommend the film to a friend.  Might not watch it again however.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The only reason this set doesn't earn 5 stars from me is Martin's tendency to confuse the story with just too many families, clans and characters.
B002DD67XG|5.0|I'm leary about buying mp3 because so often it's some version I haven't heard or another group doing the song. This is as advertised and the songs really take me back.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the first time I've seen a movie based on a book adhere so closely to the original text. I do recommend however reading the entire trilogy before diving into the movie.
B002P79M3C|5.0|But this is one of the funnier episodes. Big Bang Theory is a great show for those twiners who are old and mature enough more than Nick at Nite.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I listen to this album non stop, one of my new favs. There is music to fit all your moods.
B008602KQI|3.0|The video was good and I enjoyed it.  I will probably watch it several times.  Even though it followed the storyline of the book, it did not cover enough to explain everything that was happening, which made it a little dis-jointed.  I think it should have been longer, at least enough to help the viewer understand why and what was really happening.<br /><br />I still gave it 3 stars because I enjoyed watching it and will again.
B008602KQI|5.0|My 10 year old daughter read the books 3 times each and absolutely loved the books.  She was very excited about seeing the movie.  While there were parts of the movie that didn't match the book exactly, she did enjoy the movie too. Even though it is rated PG-13, it is not too gruesome for a 10 year old.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I'd LOVE to give 5 stars but because of the pixelation in quite a few artistic scenes, I'm knocking it down a notch!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The story (A Song of Ice and Fire) is a fantastic series, but this review is just about the Kindle version and not the author's work.  I haven't noticed any problems with the text on the Kindle version and I am half way through the third book.  I was hesitant to purchase this Kindle version after several negative reviews about the quality of the transcription (or whatever the appropriate word is for going from the paper and ink books to the electronic version).<br /><br />There are no page numbers that I have seen so I can't compare notes with my friend who is reading the paperback version that this Kindle file is based on, but we can usually work it out by which character and where in the story the chapter refers to.<br /><br />I often read on my actual 3rd Gen Kindle Keyboard and on my Android smartphone.  There have been a few instances where synching has placed me several \\"pages\\" ahead or behind where I was on the previous device, but this issue has appeared with other books I've read through Kindle and may be more of an Android versus Kindle Reader transition issue.<br /><br />Since my Kindle Reader (in it's lighted case) is less than half the size of even one of the four books this electronic version represents (and I plan to buy the fifth and subsequent books in this format) the ease of portability alone is almost worth the extra cost.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this as with all, legally purchased, Kindle editions is that I can't give the book to someone else when I am done...it's not realistic to expect that most people would  be able to complete all four of these books in the two week lending period available for most books (I am not even sure that's an option with these books).  I certainly understand the money making reasons why Amazon and the publishers don't want you to be able to do this, but they were making plenty of money off of paper and ink books before eReaders, and continue to do so, which can be passed from person to person indefinitely.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it so much that I bought the other two immediately after I finished the first, and couldn't put the series down for three days straight.  The perfect solution to a napping baby while on maternity leave!
B006QQCCOY|1.0|This film is boring, slow moving and not worth a viewing. The theme is disturbing-an older man having an affair with a teenager.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|A solid book, Ghosts of Ascalon can be read and enjoyed on it's own merits without any previous knowledge of the computer games Guild Wars (1 and 2).  For those who are already engaged  in the world of Tyria it is an epic journey.  You get to revisit many elements which are unique to Tyria and go on a great adventure.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who would like to spend some more time in the world of Guild Wars but are unable to play the game 24/7.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Very honest book. Which makes the personal story part of the book interesting as well although I'm usually not such a fan of such accounts and bought it mainly because it was about a solo hike of the PCT. I can't but recommend the book!
B007SGM084|5.0|this was completely worth it. I read all three books on vacation and it was so nice to have it all on my ipad.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee Dugard's story is riveting and shocking.  It was hard to read of her unspeakable treatment at the hands of a monster and his wife. All those lost years! I just hope she has peace and happiness now with her daughters. The book was well written and I couldn't put it down.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|A great sequel which is setting up the third and final installment. A great read which I found fun, new life in a crowded field and worth the money, time and overall I encourage others looking for a quick read in the Kindle.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is riveting - can't put it down type and done very believably.  I recommend it highly to all groups.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I want to start out by saying Fight Club is one of my favorite movies and every time I watch it I cannot turn away or do anything else until it's finished as it is so captivating and ingenious. I read the book before I watched the movie and I did enjoy Chuck Palahniuk's novel but to me it wasn't a masterpiece. But then this movie comes along and it left me speechless.<br /><br />This movie deals with an unnamed narrator telling the events of his life, how he works for a crooked insurance agency and his boring dull life eats away at him to where he develops insomnia and begins buying things he doesn't really want or need. He later meets up with a man named Tyler Durden, who the two begin a friendship and begin causing all sorts of chaos.<br /><br />I will not give any else away to the plot in case you've yet to see the movie, but I will praise this movie.<br /><br />ALL of the actors in this movie, even the minor characters, were simply flawless. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton I feel were robbed of an Oscar as I think they both gave the best performances of their careers. And the writing was so crisp and engrossing you will lose track of time.<br /><br />Fight club is a movie that will challenge you're perceived outlook on life and society, so maybe it's not for everyone, but this is the most underrated movie ever and unquestionably David Fincher's, Brad Pitt's, and Edward Norton's best film to date.
B0086700CM|4.0|Very addictive game but fun for the whole family to play!  My 8 year old loves it!  It is such a fast paced game that it is easy to take turns or just useful to kill a few minutes worth of time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was not a good book.  Very poorly written and in a soft porno style.  Really a waste of time and money.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|The only thing more awesome than this feature length version of a childhood favorite, is the fact that it was released on blu-ray on my 47th birthday. But the icing on my birthday cake was being able to share it with my six month old granddaughter who loved it as much as I did.  She smiles every time I start singing \\"how baaad can I be...\\"
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This movie was much better than I had anticipated. I think it left you kind of hanging at the end but that I am guessing is due to sequels that will be following. All in all this was a good movie and not to gory even given the subject matter. I look forward to seeing what happens next.
B008602KQI|5.0|After seeing it twice in at the movie theater ; to a full house each time...Hearing the managers say that isn't enough popcorn for the Hunger Games ... I would say we have a winner here :)  I bought the dvd the other day and watched it.....I sent a copy to my daughter who hadn't seen it yet ;she loved it.....I lent out my copy and it is still out there after two weeks....It is getting shared with several people who pass it on to the next person.....I just hope it finds it's way  back home to me soon :)  The story line was great. The actors were great...I have been hungery before ,so it hit home for me that there is hunger everywhere....I can't wait for part two to hit the Theaters :)
B004159Y98|5.0|the CD was recommended to me by a friend and it was a good recommendation!  you can sample the music but he's an amazing musician!
B006P96PAO|5.0|An amazingly rich story with a series of life events that come together in an achingly real saga of the challenges and life choices that face families/people everywhere.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Nice app, easy to use, has more than enough soothing sounds to put me to sleep. Well worth the time and space put on my kindle fire.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The books were easy to read. I hoped that each one would get better but that didn't happen.<br />I would think that the storyteller,whose SAT was 2100+,would have a few more words and phrases to describe all of those breathtaking discoveries.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the book it kept you wanting more!! I did get a little angry with Ana because she kept pushing certain situations but was not or have not dealt with her own.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a terrific ending to the love story started in Book 1.All 3 books were a little \\"kinky\\" but they sure got my hormones working.  Would recommend it to open mind people (of all ages) who like love stories.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This first book started out slow but still kept my attention. Very interesting and kept my attention and was glad you wrote the next book for us to figure out the real deal:-)
B007704HO6|5.0|Loved it!  Will read it again.<br />I also love cats and have read many stories!<br />Let me know if you write further on cats.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was a real page turner,... finished reading the series in just three days,... could not put it down.  And now every women at work is enjoying it.  [[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's so fun! Its my newest addiction! Could not live without it! It entertains me anywhere I go anytime! Love it!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this book was going to be really trashy. Thought it was going to be all about sex, but it's not. The story is amazing, makes me wish I could find my Fifty Shades!!
B001C3DKBK|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums from my time at university. It continues to rank among my top albums of all time. If you only know the Moody Blues from their single hits, this album gives a deeper perspective to their gifts as writers and as a band. Although sometimes unmentioned when bands from this era are being bandied about (Beatles, Stones, etc.) I consider them on the same plane and just as innovative and provocative. The remastering of the cuts and the additional mixes only makes it more enjoyable. I highly recommend this album for your collection.
B0042U94UQ|2.0|The single disc, NTSC Dual Layer DVD edition didn't work for us when I tried to playback on the Sony PS3.  These manufacturers and these movie studios could be a bit more accommodating, and not make it so difficult or complicated in order to play back movies that are purchased.  While they're at it, the movie studios should also do away with region codes.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Read the early reviews of this book. This book is a betrayal. Everyone with a military background knows it. We learn early on that any information can give the enemy an advantage.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Before starting this book, I thought it might be too much of a technical and historical rehash of the assassination of President Kennedy. The book is far from that. It is warm human interest story that is also quite thought provoking.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have all of GabySoft FlipPix Art puzzles.  I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR MORE!!  An afternoon goes by so fast when I start playing.  I love these.
B008F5YDRI|2.0|This movie was very slow from the beginning.....a British production and their dialogue and sense of humor is different from mine.....sorry I even bought this dvd.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was very good and the video quality, for the most part, was quite good. Amamzon does a good job of having quality videos to choose from and the Prime selection is getting better!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started reading, I could not put it down.  I ordered the next two sequels immediately after finishing the first book.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|really, most of my concert dvd's go back to the grateful dead, neil youngs eariler stuff & so on - so an 80's music dvd video was a reach for me - but wow but a band! what a performance - & the band did not stay together (as a complete unit) much longer after that - a one of a kind performance - & the bass player was great - I wonder where she ended up?
B001AG52AG|5.0|The Golden Compass is a fantastic magical journey for young and old. It is superbly acted, filmed with terrific special effects, and way creative artsy sets..<br />Fantasy adventures do not get much better than this. Nicole Kidman, and Daniel Craig give superb performances making this film a must-see.<br />Highly recommended! [...]
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a great app. I love using it and it helps a lot. time to charge, time left while using certain things. heat of the battery and all this other stuff.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Enjoyable read. This was recommended to me, and I am glad I read it.  Amnesia themes are a bit of a cliche, but it still works. Well paced.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. A must own for any family. It is the first movie of a trilogy based on books with the same name. Movie arrived as scheduled and amazon included a digital copy with their cloud; for a total of two digital copies.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was a very exciting adventure with lots of electrifying battles. Piper, Leo, and Jason were the best of friends . They learned to trust each other with their  lives, Jason learned a lot about his past, and Leo does too. I would very much reccomend this book to any Percy Jackson fans out there!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I am totally enjoying Some Nights. The music feels fresh and old school at the same time. I've already recommended it to few people and I force my coworkers to listen but they seem to enjoy it too!
B004TI5N38|4.0|This is the second book that David Baldacci has written, that I have read, that will hopefully have a sequel. True Blue was the other. Camel Club and The King-Maxwell series were great. I just started the Shaw-James books. Baldacci's books are entertaining and informative. Even if the narratives are only 50% real life the inside workings of the Government Agencies are thought provoking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|one of the besr apps ever created it is like conect the dots in a creative awsome way like nothing before it! you can time yourself. you can take the free trial which is not a trial because there is a ton of levels! so get this app and you will not stop playing FLOW!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love the whole trilogy!!  I couldn't put it down until I finished the whole story and even then I wanted to read the whole story all over again.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, but of course I love every book that Michael Connelly has ever written.  When I start a book by Michael Connolly, i can't put it down. I highly recommend this book.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I love this movie. I would watch it again and again. Well worth the money for the rental. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|A story of love and the sacrifice that makes it amazing. A take of a Mother's love. Even if it is not of a biological mother. We realize that that expression of selflessness is so great as to be unbroken even by the power of nations. A love that shines like A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|All Murakami fans will love this sequel to the 1Q84 volumes...superbly written, original - the old Murakami magic lives on...enjoy...
B004TSXUWY|4.0|This is a attractive story. The description of the anxiety, bad feelings and nervous are great. The way to present they story and narrate is quite interesting. And of course the open-ended provides a wide imagination for readers.
B00932A6G4|5.0|Some of the best animation I've encountered.  The video was just plain fun.  On the down side, the story continues the characters developed in earlier films, but their appearance is totally changed.  It would have been better to use the animated likenesses of the original actors.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I like Guy Pierce so im being nice, its all been done before but has some entertaining moments and a twist ur not gonna expect.
B0026HKO2E|5.0|The matrix reloaded keeps me on th edge of my seat. Except perhaps that ten minute party scene, other wise once thats out of the way the movie is incredible.
B008602KQI|3.0|All I can say is Jennifer Lawrence! The only thing that kept me going was her striking beauty, not the way your thinking either, she is just amazing and natural, not contrived like most others in movie. I hear the book was good.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Great from beginning to end. Couldn't put it down! There are all the qualities I enjoy in a book, love, adventure and great writing..
B001NVIZ3E|4.0|A fun movie to watch. I like Errol Flynn. Reminds me of when I was a child and we were able to watch these great shows on Saturday's.  Hey Trigger looks pretty good in this movie, he never dreamed he would soon be an overnight success...see things can change. :)
B008602KQI|3.0|I was really anticipating this movie, a lot of my friends had read the book, so I thought I was in for a really interesting show.  It was slow, it was mostly disgusting and it had a really un-interesting ending.  Perhaps this should have all just stayed a book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I began reading it after returning from Oak Island NC; they were filming it while we were there.  Southport is right beside Oak Island, and I have been there so I could relate to some of what he was saying about the area. The book is very interesting and easy to read with some suspense and romance. I thought the paranormal sighting was odd and took away from the story for me. It was a great read otherwise.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a more captivating book. Brilliant author able to play perfectly with one's senses. Will remain forever on the best seller's list. Best book ever in its genre
B008602KQI|1.0|The Hunger Games was not worth watching. The plot was stitched together from disparate events, and the acting was juvenile. Well, maybe this is a movie for children.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I happen to love this author, so have read almost every book she has written, while history there is a slight bend to it that keeps your interest at the same time. The Kingmaker's Daughter I really enjoyed and hated to put it down for the mundane issues of everyday living.
B005FJ7EIC|3.0|Acting was good, but there was little back story to the main characters or the reason for the vampire apocalypse.  Some may not mind the lack of back story.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good movie my granddaughter really liked it she watched it twice. I like that I didn't have to go shopping for it .It came right to my door. Thank You
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|This series slowly takes you in with the simple language, but compellingly strong, intelligent characters.  Africa is the setting and becomes one of the main characters.  Mma Robotswe is such a fun, strong character that I could not wait to see what she did next without the tools of computers, Internet access, etc.  She completes her cases with sheer intelligence and logic \\"in the old Botsswana way.\\". The only thing I could say in a negative way is the pricing of these books.  They take so little time to read but still cost too much to read all at once.  Why is a 200- page Kindle book almost $10?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all of the fifty shades can't wait to see if she writes ant more. You will fall in love with fifty too. To now what that means you need to read it.
B002APS61I|5.0|Nowadays.. It's hard to find a movie that isn't too extreme whether it be violence, sexuality or ludeness.  Just a good, wholesome movie with a great score that makes you feel better after watching it.  The way it really should be.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|There are so many twists and turns in this book that I got whiplash reading it Definitely worth the ride!!
B008COII1Y|5.0|As civil war zombie films go... Exit Humanity was a pretty well reilized vision. It had a pretty good cast, and it looked great! Dee Wallace, and Bill Mosely always bring their \\"A\\"game to every production! I really enjoyed the animation also, and thought that it did alot to help flesh out the story. Nice Dark Ride! dB
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was so disappointed when I went to purchase the next book and it is not out yet - that is how much I loved this book. I had never heard about slamming before but love the concept! The storyline is just so real and raw at times. You can definitely relate!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy was excellent once I got past the language. It was a constant read. Was not content until I finished all the books
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many hours of fun...cant put it down. love saving points to see how many games I can open. families will love it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a well written series of books.  There were enough disclaimers to shy away the folks who dont want to read this type of writing.  The author engaged the reader to continue to read the books to find out what happended next and why it happended.  There is more to these books than meets the eye, or the porn.  This is intrigue, romance, Love, family and revenge all in one.  You did not want to put down this book.  I found it interesting, and appealing.  This is not the usual read for me, but there was intrigue and got me to read the pages till there were no more.  I will read other books by this author.  Thank you for a entertaining read.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I listened to this CD all day and I'm still itching for more. I love their creativity with sounds and instruments, it hasn't been done like this yet. I bought their EP a couple months ago and played it non stop. This band should be up for the best new artist award, not the overproduced garbage that's on MTV.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Loved the book - the story was unique and I didn't want it to end.  Found myself wanting to join Harold's pilgrimage or at least begin one of my own.  Felt for his wife but loved Harold, and was completely surprised when the truth regarding their son came to light.
B007JRU2UK|3.0|Plot line was good, but topic was a bit macabre.  The film was definitely worth watching, but glad I didn't buy it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a find, a wonderful find. I've read lots and lots of different fantasy (and other genres) authors, but it was a long time since I was really really positively surprised!<br /><br />There's often things that annoys me when reading books, authors that hasn't thought things through, or fins \\"shortcuts\\" in their storytelling. Things that you as a reader wants to change. Here there is very little of that. I love the way the story is told. It's \\"new\\", especially for a fantasy novel. Books in this genre are very often based on some kind of narrative that foretells something about the future, told separately from the story. A lot of times (my opinion) this is done clumsily, and is often used as a crutch for the author, to help him/her explain the story. Raven's Shadow does this as well, in line with the expectations - it IS fantasy after all. But here it's done well, exceptionally well. Also, it's something that really adds to the story, not some kind of crutch as mentioned earlier. There's twists and turns that gives the story depth, instead of weird prophecies needed to explain the characters strange behavior.<br /><br />Apart from a nice \\"new\\" touch on the storytelling this book excels in many other aspects as well. Some are perhaps given, but nevertheless oh so important. One of these is language. It's well written. Both in terms of usage of language, and in technical terms as well. Few errors or grammatical strangeness's.<br /><br />Characters are plausible and most often with nice depth. Not the usual fantasy hero, where it's all black and white, without any touch of human faults.<br /><br />Magic plays a small part in this first book, but so far looks nice as well.<br /><br />All in all I would say that this is a must read for any fantasy fan out there. If it continues like this I would easily place this amongst my other most favorite fantasy writers! (Like Tolkien, R. R. Martin, Jordan for comparison)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I loved it I use it every night!! you SHOULD buy it but you do hav to buy the other thing if u want more!!but still get these apps PLZ!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|books 2 and 3 are much better reading/listening.  can't wait for the FINAL book to totally END the series.  E James is a very talented writer.  One of the best.  Has kept my interest to keep reading/listening over and over.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book is definitely a page turner. Once you start you can hardly put it down.<br />I would recommend this to everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Like the first two this book was also hard to put down. It was very suspenseful! Even though it was a little too dark for my taste, I would still recommend it as a finish to the trilogy and a great read.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is good if you want to look at the weather for diffrent places. It's updated about every hour so It's pretty much acurrate. I'd suggest downloading this for the folowing reasons- Extreme weather updates, local news and weather 24/7.<br /><br />WARNING: NEEDS WIFI TO WORK!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a great follow up to The Hunger Games! I could not put the book down, because I had to find out what was going to happen next.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I'm only a quarter of the way through the book and it is already the most in-depth treatment of life in North Korea that I have ever read. I've seen the Russian tourist's furtive pictures, I've seen the VICE guide, and while both great, neither has candid interviews with actual North Koreans like this book does. I am fascinated by the secretive nation, and I highly recommend this book for people that feel the same.
B00122BEPA|5.0|This CD is awesome. Truly is the best of. Both old and new songs. Incredible value. Definitely a \\"must have\\" if your a Van Halen fan.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I deleted this from my Kindle due to the violent and gore.  Nightmares and if it is any indication of life in that time I can only pray (if there is reincarnation) that I was never a part of it.
B003R0MF5I|4.0|The entire series of CHUCK is family friendly and a pleasure to watch.  The DVD set itself is designed well and I've had no trouble playing the discs. I'd recommend CHUCK to anyone who just wants to watch something that makes you smile.  It's a shame the series is over.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is the same PS3 controller that comes with the PS3 console. Very well made, and seems like it will last forever. We have a few extra controllers for the kids. Has the motion and rumble on it, which is to be expected. It charges via USB, which makes for easy charging anywhere. The PS3 has to be on to charge, so it is convenient to have a dedicated charger. The controller holds a charge for a long time. In the years that I've had these controllers, they continue to hold a charge like day one and you can play for a long time on one charge. Great controller!
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Stephen king is an excellent writer this book is one of his bests fiction and fantasy he uses are great loved it!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Any book as brilliant and original as 'The Hunger Games' would be a tough act to follow.  Suzanne Collins' 'Catching Fire' is a gallant attempt on the part of the author to do so. We follow Katniss, Gale, Peeta and Haymitch into a post-games Panem with a malevolent President Snow making it clear he intends to stamp out any unrest in the Districts caused by Katniss's act of rebellion with the poisonous berries at the end of the first Hunger Games. She's to go back into the 'arena' where Snow plainly intends to have her killed. The book held my attention but couldn't quite capture the breath-taking, compulsive page turning of 'The Hunger Games'. Still, Collins is a fine writer and the world she has created is both chilling and believable. For the followers of 'The Hunger Games' I would definitely recommend 'Catching Fire'.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and can't wait for the sequel to come out in October.  All of my friends that read it really liked it too!  I think its better than \\"50 Shades of Grey.\\"
B0086DBE62|4.0|My wife wanted to see this movie.  I thought the kids might enjoy it too, so we watched it as a family.  Based on the previews, I really didn't think I'd like it, but it's actually pretty good.  It's a little bit of a twist on Snow White, but you'll still know the basic story.  Julia Roberts gets top billing, but Snow White is still the star.  She just has a little more girl power this time.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|One of the best albums I've listened to in years. It gets better every time through. Brittany Howard (the lead singer) has an incredible voice, and her lyrics are both powerful and revealing.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I loved this movie in theaters. Still love it. Love the music too. Just a plain good movie. I would recommend this to other people.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|If you like watching cops and comedic films like Superbad or other Simon Pegg & nick frost films like Shaun of the dead or Paul then this is the movie for you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker in my opinion was as interesting if not more interesting to read than the first book.  To me it was more about finding out who Christian Grey is and what made him the kind of person that he is. I recommend this book to everyone who has read Fifty Shades.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have not finished the book yet, but what I have read is very interesting.  We all have had our fifty shades of grey if we just think about it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|u just hv to get this app!  not only do u get to read ur Bible on the go.. but there r plans that u can follow and get ur daily bread
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was a little slow getting into things but once it got going I couldn't put it down. It was sexy but more than that the back story and plot was so intense that I wanted more.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Never knew there was a sequel to one of my favorite childhood stories. Wish they'd done a movie on this one too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved this second book...after reading the first I instantly had to read the second and this book didn't disappoint. I loved the story behind it. The author really brought the characters to life.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I found Jetpack Joyride to be a fun time killer for myself.  It is not overly challenging for my kids and does not require me to play the game for them just to get them past a level.
B000SVZIGC|3.0|We wanted to see Anastasia, because my daughter skates for the song \\"Once upon a December\\".<br />It is not a bad movie, but not a good one either. There are parts when my 7 and 5 years old kids<br />were scared. That kind of ruined the movie for me. These parts did not even added too much for the<br />story in my opinion. At other parts they were bored. They say there is a shortened version. I plan to check that out.
B008OBPGQK|5.0|This is one of Linkin Parks better albums. Sounds good live. It was easily downloaded and is played nicely through my Amazon cloud music player app on my iphone.
B007NWPB4S|5.0|Fell in love with this tune after hearing it so many times during the Olympic promos! Ordered the CD from Amazon and it arrived in no time.  I am a grandma and have to admit I like to put this gal on when I clean my house ---- gets Grandma's house spic and span and I also get a great workout :)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This version of the game is addicting, with four difficulty levels and 10-14 different games per level.  I have completed all of the games and are going back in to try to improve my speed.  To get 3 stars, you need to complete each game in 5 minutes or less.  This is not always so easy.  I am now trying to get down to 4 minutes or less on each.  Give it a try.
B008602KQI|4.0|My teenage son read The Hunger Games trilogy a couple of years ago.  Every day he would give me a detailed retelling of the story.  I decided to read the books before the movie came out, and then, of course, we had to see it in the theatre.  We bought the video so we could re-watch it and, eventually, look forward to owing the trilogy on video.  Predictably, I think the books are better than the movie/video, but the movie is very good.  I disagree with some of the casting (as do many), but overall the actors are outstanding.  Cinematically, the movie/video is superb.  I recommend the video who enjoy drama, action and political thrillers -- whether or not you've seen the movie or read the books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending book of this series, very intense and kept my interest all the way thru.  This will be a series I will read again in the future.  Recommend this one to all the women out there.
B003B02O0A|5.0|A Time to Kill by John Grisham is a great story. Set in a small town in Mississippi, the characters and setting are believable. I really liked this book.
B008133MDK|5.0|I wish that there were more episodes and that they'd come more quickly! Benedict Cumberbatch has updated Conan Doyle's protagonist cleverly and Martin Freeman brings brio to Watson.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is a thought provoking well directed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie is a must see.
B0014EU5XI|4.0|A ton of songs. It sounds great. The price was right. There were a few songs I wasn't familiar with but there are no complaints.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|I love to read JS and HTML5 title based books, a very huge Thanks to AMAZON &lt;3 Kindel product and its worth it<br />thanks Amazon
B007V508CC|5.0|By far the BEST Maroon 5 album out there and I own every single one!! Such up beat, personable songs!!! LOVE rockin out to this song! Even my 12 year old sister LOVES it!! Def worth spending the money on!
B004US4K2C|5.0|I love this app becuase I can turn my phone dialer to what ever theme I want... Wether it be all black or maybe pink cheetah
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book first and then viewed the movie.  The book was great and the movie followed its story line.  Wished I would have seen the movie first though.  The book would have filled in the blanks later.  A must watch and read.
B008EQIK90|4.0|Funny movie, as it kept my attention.  Good job keeping feel of original series and liked all of the cameos.
B008602KQI|5.0|I like movies where the female doesn't come off looking like a crying snivelling baby who needs a pair of testicles to save her ( she brought her own). I wish they make more films like this.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love to play Angry Birds when we are traveling. It keeps me busy and makes the trip go much faster. I also like to play the game while relaxing on a rainy day.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Great game to pass the time if you have a long wait. It really makes you think and the levels do get challenging as you get farther and farther.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic. Best read in a long time, cant get enough of it. The author's writing style itself is just wonderful.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|Most of the movie is fair, but it gets good at the end when the boy and girl (can't remember their names now) decide that they won't take the route where they'll only be one winner (one left to live) and decide that they both will die. Anyway, the committee decided that both would be the winners.
B00866H7SS|4.0|I thought Fifty's had set a bench mark, but these other writers are taking it to a different level.  Enjoyed it just as much, with a very different plot.  A more realistic world to live and fantasize about. Gideon and Eva make you want more.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I am a fan of Michael Connelly's works, particularly the Harry Bosch books.  This book was another great effort  by this talented author, which is why i rated it the highest possible
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is an incredibly fun game.Since its all about the angles and its effect, there are virtualy limetless outcomes. Also it has many different birds.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|The special effects were great, I enjoyed the nod to Bubo the mechanical owl from the Original.  BUt the story wasn't as good as either of the first movies.<br />Decent popcorn flick, but not expect too much.
B00571F26Y|4.0|An exceptionally informative book with a good scientific basis. Compelling evidence why wheat is disagreeing with more and more people. A must read. I couldn't put it down!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|The first Guy Ritchie Sherlock movie was phenomenal.  This movie is great, but suffers slightly by comparison because it wasnt quite as good.<br />I like how they modified Sherlocks planning out anticipating fight scenes. Keeping the same cool concept from the first, but changeing it a bit to keep it fresh.  Mild spoiler alert his plans can get interupted, and there are others out there who can do the same thing.<br />Overall not quite as good as the first, but I highly reccomend this film.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I did not expect it to end they way it did.  Which by the way, had a great ending. The author made the whole book a \\"can't put down book\\".
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider Solitaire is a very addicting game. You can play one suit, two suits or four. I play the two suits and win about 50% of the time. I can play for hours at a time. I can't seem to master the four suit game but do try it now and then. I have it on my laptop and desk top computers and wanted it for my Kindle fire. I do wish it had a different icon though that wasn't as scary looking.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Got to read a few pages, and then had to endure page after page after page of detailed sex acts over and over and over throughout the book.  Enough is enough!  Would have liked a little more story line.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read this book in 2 days because I could not put it down!!!! I encourage anyone to read the whole series.
B008602KQI|4.0|Didn't really know what to expect.  Had heard several different things which made me a bit leary.  Very different from what I had been lead to believe it would be like.  Good action, good story line and an ending I could live with comfortably.  Worth the time to watch.  Looking forward to more such movies.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game lengthy play time the app has timely updates from developer still seven words short now I post
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book after seeing and hearing everyone talk about it. I thought that it must be good. Not only was this book full of spelling and grammar issues (actually all 3 books were like that, I honestly think that the editor should be fired for what was not corrected in this book), but the hype around this book was better than the book. I read the series and would not do it again nor would I recommend the book to anyone. I have read books more erotic than this and less abusive in nature.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|If I could figure out how to give it 4 1/2 starsI would. excellent book abook about a  simple man doing an extrodinay thing. At times hinted at parells to Christianity. My best summer read.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This motion detection light is perfect for my use.  Rather than leave a light burning when we are out of the house at night, all we have to do is approach the back door, and the light senses us and lights up the way.  This light is no \\"nightlight\\", it lights up our entire breezeway, so we aren't going to trip on something before getting to the door.  If you're looking for a nightlight, look for something with fewer LED's that takes less batteries.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|I cannot get it to work. I take the picture but it does not read it. I have tried different ways, thinking maybe I am not getting a clear enough picture but still nothing. Glad it was free.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was a nice read once you get past parts that make you want to strangle her for her for being so nieve - still its a book about growth and that is sort of the point.  I liked her frank approach towards journaling an epic hike.  I wonder if I would have liked it as much if I couldn't relate from personal experience.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love it....only problem I have noticed is that occasionally it is slow to open on kindle fire sometimes. Very habit forming...
B001661RC2|4.0|The Black Keys' signature simplistic blues-based soul comes shining through on Attack & Release. The songs have depth, honesty and grit. These are qualities that can be hard to find in current music. One of the best current bands out there.
B007SGM084|1.0|If you think this book is good then you must be missing something in your life! I couldv bought a porn for so much less! So disappointed...1 star for trying.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Got this very quickly. Excellent music...great road tunes for out on the highway on the Harley. Katie Segal can sing! She does a great version of \\"Son of a Preacher man\\"!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have looked on the appstore for days for a decent alarm clock app...and I finally found one, it has several alarm sounds and lets you easily pick a song to use as an alarm. And there are also three beautiful and functional clock faces. The weather function is great you can choose weatheer it shows the weather to. there's also several options for the alarms. overall it is the single best alarm clock app I've seen.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Very poor, repetitive and boring writing style, managed 3 chapters and gave up, would not recommend this book to anyone
B008EQIEWS|4.0|5 stars for Special Effect .4 Stars for Story. 3 stars for Acting and directing . Adding for your collection of Class of the Titans movies if you are a fan and just enjoy the movie because it's better than lots of movies out there  in the past and present .I watched this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD not on Amazon Instant Video .I received my order on time and the packing is good. Shipping fast with free shipping .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book almost more than the other parts of the trilogy. This one had more suspense and action along with the seductive parts.
B008602KQI|5.0|All I can say is the movie was graet,it looked real. I just hope we CAN DO BETTER WHEN OR IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great matching game to keep your mind sharp.  I even played it with my 4 year old grandson.
B002DD67XG|2.0|If you have grey hair turn on the James Taylor.  I think the guy is a vampire, not in the cool twilight type of way.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This workout will kick your butt!! You definitely feel it the next day! I world recommend purchasing for a nice combo of cardio, strength and abs.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie follows the book fairly close cutting out a lot of the slow pre-game preparations which helped keeping interest up.  One of my all time favorites
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Best book ever, hands down! Anyone who is a fan of music, or even just interested in an awesome non fiction, this book is one that can't be put down! It's a must buy!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The format was good.  Cannot recommend this book.  The ending was not believable.<br />A mystery was created and the ending was unsatisfying.
B007ZM0XGM|5.0|New Girl is a funny, fresh new show with people who are all probably in their early 30s.  The show always puts me in a better mood.  The chemistry between the actors (Schmidt, Winston, Nick and Jess) is great and they all really mesh well.  I recomend all episodes for watching.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great series.  It should continue on.  I love the characters and the way that they interact.<br />Please pick up a new series with these characters.  I read the 3 book series twice.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I purchased the Yahoo Mail app at the suggestion of a friend who also has a Kindle.  It does what it is supposed to do...download email from Yahoo.  I find it a little annoying that you have to actually look at each email in order to delete it.  There is some email that I receive that Yahoo just seems incapable of moving to the spam folder.  On my smart phone or when logged into my computer, I can delete these items without having to look at them.  Not an option with the Yahoo Mail app for Kindle.
B001J20ZIA|5.0|Want an easy opening to talk about bullying with younger children? This movie is a good means to and end to talk about the bully in all of us.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Their music is stuck in my head like a trance hours/days after I have listened to it. It is a great album and I highly recommend seeing them in concert as well - you will not be disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST OUT OF THE 50 SHADES TRILOGY IN MY OPINION....YOU REALLY GET TO UNDERSTAND CHRISTIAN IN THIS BOOK.  I COULD NOT PUT ANY OF THESE BOOKS DOWN.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games captures you from the very begining, keeps you enthralled throughot, and at the end has you wanting more. Although there were some deviations from the book, the movie presents the story very well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has been entertaining, challenging, and Fun! A great mobile game for on the go. Quick to pull up and it can be shared alongside others.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read this book after watching the HBO series. I was very impressed with Martin's writing and am now reading the second book of the series. I highly recommend this book to fans of fantasy a la J. R.R. Tolkien.
B007SGM084|4.0|I liked the story and the way was developed, I recomend it if you like a good love story... Warning! Kind of graphic.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game! very addicting! wish more of my friends played this instead of farmville! can't. get enough of it! try it you'll. love it too!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book!  If you are a dog lover especially, you'll look at your dog a bit differently after reading this.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|with the hype that this movie received i was expecting more than just another movie about people forced to fight it out for some maniacal blood thirsty society - not to say the movie wasn't well done - it was - i guess i was just looking or hoping for something fresh - i am glad i waited to rent it vs buying it
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|I haven't always loved Regina Spektor, but I saw her on The Daily Show talking about this album awhile back and decided I should maybe get it. After listening to the samples, I was hooked. I listen to it all the time now! Her voice is simply mesmerizing. My favorite songs on this album are Firewood, which is slower and sad, and Don't Leave Me, which is bouncy and fun. Get this album!
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|i've owned or watched every version of blade runner - they are all unique but this one i think is the closest to being \\"real deal\\" - it just feels right - i think if i had just one version i could watch or recommend this would be the one - they should allow directors more control when they are as good as ridley scott.
B00122LXTM|1.0|I found this CD in a bargain bin at a local retailer, and purposefully chose the extended version in lieu of a more traditional \\"best of \\" version. The versions were nothing like what I grew up listening to, and it sounded like the 2012 middle-aged version of the Doobies, and not the young, fresh-voiced lads of long ago. I really didn't enjoy the CD at all, and will be passing it on to another fan in hopes that they will like it better than I did. The harmonies weren't crisp, their voices sounded old and tired, and I kept fast-forwarding through the songs hoping to find one that was like I remembered, or better due to being an extended version. Sad to say that didn't happen.
B008602KQI|5.0|This book will keep you wanting more. It will keep you up thinking what will happen next. I definitely recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After hearing rave reviews on The View, I decided to purchase this book.  I must say I was a little disappointed in the ending.  Is this setting us up for a sequel?  I didn't have any trouble putting it down (as was stated on The View).  It was a psychological thriller, but I was waiting for a better, more determined ending.  And what's with all the other tidbits at the end of the book?
B0086DBE62|4.0|This movie is visually spectacular and has an interesting plot.<br /><br />It pleased both a 50yo dad and a 9yo daughter.<br /><br />And the film is a bit profound. It is a story about female aging and the agony of losing beauty and being surpassed by the younger woman.<br /><br />Every beautiful woman knows or fears this life transition.  Hopefully, they don't adopt the Queen's defense.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|The Lorax is a great childrens movie. The meaning behind it is very important to our future generation. My children love it and it keeps their attention to the very end. I highly recommend it.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|This is the book that made Hemingway well known and it reminds me why classics are so enduring,<br />Writing, character develpment, story telling. Highly recommend it to introduce Hemingway and a reread for those who want to experience again his great talent.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My boys love watching Mulan. While the theme that the movie covers is complex for my children, I have found that they like the action and the silliness.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is a must read for everyone who has a weight problem or knows someone with a weight problem (that's everybody, I think!).  Gary Taubes neatly and completely unravels the bad nutrition science we've been fed for the last 50 years and lays out the path to recovering our health and losing those extra pounds. Since applying the principles in this book and its companion, Good Calories, Bad Calories, I have not only lost weight, but improved my health considerably. My cholesterol level is awesome and I haven't been sick, even had a cold, in almost two years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|funest game ever it has so many apps. I love it I like it lt awesome amazing cool fun love best app ever played
B008602KQI|5.0|Straight to the point. I have been trying to get the books from my son to read them. He loans them out before I can get them. He told me the movie was very close to the book. The movie was filmed fairly close to home (the North Carolina side of the Smoky Mountains). A high school friend of mine cooked the pigs and bread used in the movie. OK. Plenty of reasons to see the movie.<br />The story line and characters were very well done! I was not disappointed at all. Despite my connections with the movie, the movie is tons of fun. Great suspense and excitement and action. Everything is setup perfectly.<br />I love this movie.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|My family and I absolutely love this movie. It builds the character and nobility of Robin Hood like no other. Russell Crowe was, as usual, spot on and endearing in his portrayal of the defender of the poor and fighter for freedom from tyranny. Can't wait for a sequel!
B007SGM084|5.0|I got this for my Kindle based on the comments of a male co-worker, who said it was too \\"girly\\" for him to get very far past the first few chapters.  The underlying story is about the special romance that develops between two people and how their love for each other allows them to overcome a great deal of personal trajedies and personal baggage from the past.  A lot of the first book is about how one character uses Dom/Sub behavior to cope with his past and how the other character attempts to understand that.  This type of behavior subsides in the following books and is replaced by them discovering their own romance and intimacy.  Yes, they are intimate just about every 3 or 4 pages, but you would have to be quite shallow to believe that is what the entire trilogy is about.  Well-written, great complexity in the characters, surprising plot twists, and who doesn't want to read about others being in love and lust to liven up their own day?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really didn't know how I would like these books, I had never read anything in this type of category.  But I got pulled in by a friend who said I should read it.  Let me just say the pull between these two is amazing.  There was something at every turn with them.  It was very exciting and I was on edge wanting to know what happened next.  I realy hope the author writes another book, possibly from his point of view.  I would love to read what made him the way that he was before Anastasia and then his views on after he met her.
B008602KQI|4.0|We enjoyed the storyline and cinematography.  Where was this filmed? Wondering if there will be a sequel, i.e., 76th Hunger Games...
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Maybe for fans of the book this is a good movie because they know the rest of the background that the movie did not cover. And it owuld have to a lot of background. Never really understand why Peter joined the \\"evil alliance\\" or why Rue did not kill the heroine when she had the chance. Had Rue already made up her mind? Just too many inconsistencies and unfinished or disconnected plot lines to make the movie believable, and I am not talking about the basic premise. That part I understood and accepted going in. Also, nothing explaining the difference between the \\"emerald city\\" dwellers and the districts, etc. A little more on that an some less scrubbing and bikini wax moments would have been useful for thos that have not read the book. Yes,  amovie cannot go into all the detail a book can go into, but a poorly done movie will not motivate anyone to buy the book.
0761158820|5.0|I purchased Papertoy Monsters for my 9 year old niece recently and she LOVED it!  She and her brother had a great time putting the monsters together and enjoyed showing them off to everyone. They are sturdy and very colorful.  This makes a perfect gift!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Reading the \\"Outlander\\" series has been fabulous.  The idea of time travel piques the interest and Gabaldon makes me want to learn Gaelic.  I am now on the 6th volume and am praying there is a 7th.  Voyager rates very high in my estimation.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|As with any book that is exceptional and has been around awhile, the so called \\"experts\\" have to put in their two cents worth and turn this wonderful account into a textbook.  I skipped the introductions because they were full of plot spoilers and discussion regarding the plot spoilers.  I have never understood why editors put that stuff first, when it should go last. I suggest you skip the intros and come back to them after you have finished reading Sledge's account.<br /><br />The story was artfully done.  Details that only someone who experienced the situations would know abound all around in this story.  God speaking to him was a little much, but he was in a super stressful situation, which could have caused him to hear a voice, saying what he wanted to hear.  The voice was strong and vivid.  The imagery was excellent.  I laughed.  I cried.  I felt profound sorrow.  Any book that can produce any one of those emotions is well-written.  This one produced them all. Well done Sledges!<br /><br />I've already told my friends and family to read this.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great application to have. Great reception of stations from around the country. Always able to enjoy preferred choice of good programs.
B005NA3B8U|3.0|The game is a great reproduction of the original.  I loved R-Type on the Amiga back in the late 80s.  Unfortunately it is significantly hampered the on-screen controls.  You often can't see what is going on because your ship, or enemy ships, are under your thumb.  My phone has a keyboard, but the game has no option for using either keyboard nor tilt-control.<br /><br />If you can deal with the blind-spot created by your thumb, it's a great game.  Personally, I haven't even played it after getting frustrated with the controls in the first dozen or so play attempts.
B008ULRY78|3.0|has lots of action in it but not much of a story line.<br />could had been better but the action made up for it some what.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild is an incredible journey through grief while walking the Pacific Coast Trail. The end of the trail is just the beginning of her life.
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|I was expecting something mind blowing and instead viewed a very boring silent film.  I thought that the film was going to show the transition from silent to movies with sound, but was wrong.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app and is easy to use.  Easy to search for scripture. Great way to always carry the Bible with you.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was a compelling novel.  Once you begin to read it, you will never want to put it down until completion.  Strongly recommend that you indulge in this novel.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If one can get through the shock & awe of book one, book two begins to develope into a beautiful love story. I loved it, it was hard to put down.
B000ID37RM|5.0|This movie is one of my Top 10 of all time. The portrait of the South, the courageous look at racism that was very contoversial in the days this movie was made. And the human relationships that included Boo the man that saved the children. I knew when I first watched this movie it was one of the best. \\"Don't miss seeing this movie\\" at any price!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game it is very fun and makes time go by fast if u need to wased time
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was un-put-downable!  I would read it until my eyes couldn't stay open anymore and then I would wake up early to continue it.  Great descriptive language and a storyline that will keep you on your toes!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's hard work to get three stars and sometimes you want to scream at the screen or tilt it to make a connection but it is challenging, time consuming fun and beats watching reruns.
B007P3TMW2|1.0|I purchased this book (twice actually by mistake), and could not get into it.  The story line seemed intriguing, so we decided to rent the movie.<br />What a disappointment!  Couldn't follow the logic of the story line, and quickly lost interest.  We turned the movie off and never saw the last half. Too boring, going no where. I think the supposed story line was not what we thought it would be.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about so I got the sample on my Kindle. By the time my sample was up I had to read the rest. Sure there's a lot of sex and adult material, but I think it's a good book and series. I read the 3 books in about a week on vacation. I am trying to convince my husband to read it.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|This is a very fun childrens movie my son loves it so much.  Its a fun idea to think your toys have there own fun lives they live and would do anything to stay by your side!
B00571F26Y|5.0|THis book was excellent as a resource for a wheat free lifestyle - it was also a HUGE persuader to remove WHEAT from our diets!!!!!  I started the next day after beginning to read this!! I also refer to it when I need to remember why Istarted this!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I've shopped on amazon since.. wow lets see my first purchase was Marvel vs Capcom 2 for the Sega Dreamcast. This app makes things easier you don't have to log on your PC I do my online shopping from my phone. Great job Amazon
B00280LYIC|5.0|Better storyline and understanding of Greek mythology than anything else I've read  it's entertaining and exciting and keeps you at the Edge of your seats throughout the entire thing
B008XG1X18|5.0|so much better than having to use their website on a small screen. I had been waiting for this for months once i learned it was available for apple products. I much prefer android over iOS. so this app was just in time.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! One of the best book to movies I've seen in a long time. Jenn Lawrence is a great actress and plays the part of Katniss very well.
