B006LSZECO|2.0|Where to start? Not sure, perhaps the slow painfully editorial beginning. The middle finally picks up, then the end comes without realizing it. I swear I thought I skipped a page!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is...AMAZING! I'm a freshman and I think this is the perfect book for a person my age. It was very well written and I will most likely end up reading it again. It is one of those books that is just perfect to read on a nice day, after homework, or just want to relax.

B00AE2LJVS|1.0|The actors speech was hard to understand because of the use of heavy local accents. The story itself seemed was uninteresting but there was lots of killing.
B0092MKFIY|2.0|Cheesy music. I listened to a sample and thought it sounded pretty good. The whole album was on sale for a decent price so I just bought it. I have since removed EVERY single song from my playlist.
B009POCG2C|4.0|I'm not much of a baseball fan but I enjoyed this picture immensely. One of the beauties of this film is how it crosses over baseball subculture with relationships of all types. Clint Eastwood plays a grumpy old timer baseball scout whose vision is going out and Amy Adams plays his lawyer-daughter trying to make partner (dependent on a big case) yet she gets called to assist her father's scouting because a friend (played by John Goodman) asks her to do it and she's scared for her father's health. Enter the standard work with your relationships from the old American perspective but the conflicts and layers are so much more.<br /><br />As one might expect the father and daughter have a troublesome relationship that became scarred when the father \\"abandoned\\" her, sending her off to stay with an uncle and aunt. As a result the daughter has obvious intimacy issues and fear of abandonment which make her troublesome in any intimate relationship. The whole thematic focus as a result is about this relationship while baseball further symbolizes and layers the issue. Compare players who are not quite up to the Major Leagues because they have one serious issue holding them back much like people who cannot function in an intimate relationship.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake plays the romantic interest to Amy Smart. He's a washed out pitcher who is trying to make a life as a baseball scout and stay in the game. Timberlake is one of the lead romantic male choices in the last few years and as expected he delivers. His lines and mannerisms are great for bringing down the walls of the Adams character.<br /><br />Overall, I'd describe this as one of those slice of life family pictures about people you can like. Baseball fans will appreciate the details, too.<br /><br />Also starring Robert Patrick as Eastwood's boss in the film.<br /><br />Eastwood claimed he was retired from acting but the 82 year old actor liked the script enough to get in front of the camera again.<br /><br />The budget for this film is not listed but it has made over $35M at the Box Office so far.<br /><br />SOUND/MUSIC: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; BASEBALL FOCUSES/SOMETHING FRESH (by Hollywood standards): B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2013.

B00APUQH0W|2.0|Ugh, this movie was just sad.  Script and storyline just one cliche after the next.  Predictable characters, predictable ending.  Waste of a couple hours. : (
1451696191|5.0|super quick delivery, arrived in perfect condition.  an emotional story about a special young man's journey after he finds two friends who care about him.
B005BW0TO4|5.0|The title should warn you that I am very biased towards this band, so my five-star rating may be because of this.  However, as per usual, they have put out a VERY good album.  I really don't have any FAVORITES off of this one, but I also found that there was not one single song I did not enjoy thoroughly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Intensely beautiful . As I was beginning to read further into it the storyline, I thought it was another Twilightish relationship between the characters but it is soo much more and deeper. You have to read on.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Such a must have for bond-lovers, namely bond music lovers! Very cool to have harder to find tracks from old movies!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Awesome book! Highly recommended. Very encompassing and thrilling.  Keeps you going back for more! Would recommend to anyone who loves romance.
B007IK44CK|3.0|It's always amusing to see brands show off their products in movies.  For Ghost Protocol, BMW took center stage with their X5, 6 series, and upcoming i5 electric vehicle.  Dubai's Burj Khalifa was also showcased with an extramural climb by TC, but it didn't actually give a full sense of the building's height.  The story itself was depressing even though the feeling of global devastation wasn't conveyed very well.  Overall, the movie had some good action sequences and some entertaining comic relief...especially when Hunt and Brandt were trying to board the boxcar.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series.....good writing and excellent acting. I think it is awesome that this is offered with out Prime membership!
1583334386|5.0|This book is INCREDIBLY insightful and VERY helpful...  Even more so if you have recognized the desire to increase your willpower/self control... I didn't get finished with the first chapter before I was recommending the book. I had many Ah Ha's and I'm not even done with reading!<br /><br />I will be back to update my review when I finish the book but it is ALREADY worth the $ and time in a few short chapters...<br /><br />Definitely has changed the course of my life!<br /><br />THANK YOU DOC!
0307352145|5.0|There's not much to add that hasn't been said in the over 600 reviews already.  This was a great book.  Being an introvert all my life I could identify with this book and it was a nice confidence booster since introverts are so often told to be more outgoing, or friendly.  This is a great book for understanding yourself if you are an introvert, it's also a great book for extroverts who can't seem to understand their introverted friends or co-workers.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I would have given it a 5 if you were able to get more hints.  Very fun addictive game.  I have it on all my electronics
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The DVD came on time and was in great condition. I bought two and they both came together, which was nice because then I wasn't looking for two separate packages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I admit that even though I was immediately pulled into this story there was apart of me that was not interested in a high school romance. I was having serious doubts about my interest in the plot when BAM. It just got better and better. The story line was so incredibly shocking, so well put together. The end twists and turns had me gripping my seat. I could not put this read down! These characters were so well rounded- so real. The delivery was impeccable. The reader knows only as much information as the main character- leaving much of the greater reality a mystery. This is what really draws the magic into the book. The relationships are so real- so intense. The trauma so real- the author doesn't shy away or cut corners. There are a lot of serious events that are hard to face in this novel- but if you can face the evil you can see the beauty on the other side. This really is a must read. Let me reiterate again that if you start reading this and think you dont want a high school romance dont worry! There is much MUCH more coming. A book that will not leave me. Very happy that I read this.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I could see how some folks could want to play it for hours. Some levels are very challenging, but worth it when you make it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A fantastic little Irish tale. Well established and enjoyable characters. The writing style is excellent at capturing the accents truly placing you into the story. The plot is well delivered and the twists are quite enjoyable. I never got bored during this read but loved it immensely. It is a story about an older man who must face the demons in his past in order to create a more enjoyable future and those around him who are apart of his journey. What a lovely little tale. Its a hard find these days to have a book with so many flawless elements. I really recommend this read!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob by William Landay --first book I put on my kindle--it is such a good book I can't put it down!
B00371QQ0M|4.0|Dune is not a film for everyone!  It's very odd. But as a Sci-Fi fan, I like it because of the various levels that it works on. A fantastic production design, confusing, but intriguing storyline, good special effects for 1984, OTT villains, spaceships and creatures etc. A healthy combination of everything really, but very very weird!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book...I've read all three in the trilogy in three days and wish there were more. Not a bad story line and some interesting twists and turns.  Very sexy and fun.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was shocked by just how much sex is in this book!  I can't believe this book is on the bookshelves for all teenagers and young kids to have access to.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I have to say after reading this book and reflecting on my own life I can see my mistakes. There is no possible way that you can reach your dreams by increasing your expense and liabilities, with out first in increasing your asset and income.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I cannot believe they sell this at Walmart on the shelf.  Any child or teenager can pick it up and read.  I did not finish the last book, because I got bored with all the sex, sex, sex.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I like the fact that u get to create the characters and ultimately make up the story line to your game. I made my character the Dr and my other character rose so I have a Dr who theme game going..
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I can't believe this is sold on any old shelf store.  This is a book that kids should not be reading.  It's sex, sex, sex.  I got tired of it.  It really interfered with the story.

B0031RAOVY|1.0|These people put a horrible American spin on a sad, but true, Japanese story.  I bought the film, but I will never loan it out to anyone.  I might just break the DVDs, so no one can watch it.  Although I'd rather not hear a sad animal story, I can withstand them.  But this was a sad story made into awful.  It had me upset for days.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|if you want to see a bear do some raunchy things, this movie is for you. its got some funny one liners but I was hopeful for a better movie.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors along with the Brontes.  Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|This is a great family movie that has some great characters, and the good ole Christmas spirit. Tom hanks had a great couple of parts as well as some stunning graphics.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is one damn fine show.  There's action, suspense, betrayal, sex, plot twists, character development, sex, and sex.  What more could you ask for?  As expected, some of the descriptions from the book were lost in translation, such as all the talk about men &#34;spreading their seed&#34; and such.  Gross, yes, but also funny.

0525953728|5.0|Highly recommended. I read it in a week while I was deployed...could not put it down.  If you want Hollywood and politics go watch Zero Dark Thirty. If you want the real deal with no agenda...this is it!
0765325950|1.0|It sucks that fans of the series now have to suffer because of the greed of Jordan's widow. Choosing not to release the ebook version until April simply because she wanted more money, or feared skewing her chances to land on the bestsellers list. How pathetic. I will probably be pirating the book now, and she will get nothing from me. Congratulations.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|NOTE: This review DOES contain SPOILERS!<br /><br />Let me say this one thing to ANYONE reading this review: \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a wonderful movie, and if you have not seen it you should do two things:<br /><br />1. Literally, run out and see it.  Now.  You'll not see a finer ensemble movie this year.  Then,<br />2. Don't read anymore of this review until you do.<br /><br />I am breaking from tradition here.  Generally, I like to write reviews that praise or criticize movies, making sure to tell minimal plot details and, above all else, not to divulge spoilers that might ruin the story for anyone who has not seen it.  This will not be the case here; I was moved enough by this superb movie to want to talk freely about it, and you should STOP HERE IF SPOILERS WILL UPSET YOU.<br /><br />\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a masterful contradiction: a mainstream movie shot like an indie, its rough edges are expressed in broad strokes as well as personal details.  It is loud yet minimal; it is personal, yet speaks to all of us.  It is a movie that is probably about no one you can think of, yet it will resonate with an intimacy that will speak to all of us.<br /><br />\\"We're not liars like they are,\\" Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence in a bravura performance) said in defining her relationship with Pat (Bradley Cooper, truly splendid in this role), and she's right: their respective brushes with mental disorder have somehow left them without the ability to restrain the words we all think but never say.<br /><br />These moments create comedy, but they can also be very uncomfortable.  We find out early they are broken people.  Pat, a teacher, was institutionalized for eight months after he left school early one day, found his wife in the shower with a fellow teacher and almost beat him to death.  Upon Pat's release he is invited to his friend Ronny's house for dinner and it is there he meets the recently widowed Tiffany, whose policeman husband died behind the wheel.  Though Ronnie specifically cautions him not to, his first words to her are, \\"How did your husband die?\\"<br /><br />It is a potentially alienating question, as is their conversation about the medication prescribed to \\"help\\" them.  Yet Tiffany responds to his honesty and a potential shaky bond is formed.  This candor is foreign to their host; Ronny himself had only just confessed to Pat how the very home improvements he had moments ago been bragging about are strangling him financially.  Urged by Pat to say this to his wife, his host frantically hushes him lest his wife might hear.<br /><br />This openness has its limits; due to the particulars of her relationship with her husband at the time of his death Tiffany is now a recovering sex addict, and Pat's tendency to continually call her a \\"slut\\" quickly wears thin.  And his inability to see beyond his need to rehabilitate his relationship with his ex-wife Nikki is a continual barrier to his relationship with Tiffany moving forward.<br /><br />Make no doubt about it: Pat is a broken man.  In fact, there are several scenes in the early part of the movie where Pat is seen reading Hemingway's [[ASIN:B002JMTV52 A Farewell To Arms]] in an effort to come to fully embrace his wife by reading her curriculum for the school year.  We laugh when he reads the ending of the novel and flings it out the window of his attic bedroom.  \\"That book sucks!\\" he shouts, complaining about the book's ending, wherein two lovers undergo tremendous hardships in WWI, escape to Switzerland and, when they are finally safe, she dies in childbirth.  He is enraged that Hemingway had the audacity to consider THAT a good and proper ending to a book.  (We'll return to AFTA later.)<br /><br />What is so refreshing about \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is how it all fits together so well and bears up under further scrutiny beyond the simple words of the script.  Their drama may not be Shakespearean in language, but it is still one we recognize as eternal, and digging for symbols is a task refreshingly rewarded.<br /><br />That Pat wears a black Hefty bag through which he's poked neck and arm holes is attributed to the moist Pennsylvanian weather, yet the fact that he sees himself as trash is not without merit.  He is continuously trying to better himself and his station so that Nikki will take him back, yet he is forever stymied by the court order forcing them apart.  That Tiffany offers to carry his letter to Nikki gives her a reason to see him, but her terms of the bargain forces him to continuously practice with her so that she may enter a dance contest some weeks away.  He agrees not only for the purpose of passing on the letter, but so that Nikki may see that he is bettering himself.<br /><br />That Tiffany and Pat's first evening takes place on Halloween bears up as well, as they are the only ones that day unmasked.  Once inside the modest diner he has taken her to he, hilariously, orders Raisin Bran--the breakfast cereal--to make sure their night together is not seen as a formal date.  Understandably, their meal ends with her soon after storming out the door, and in her anger she cries out when he tries to mend things, arousing the public to her cause.  It is her betrayal of him that causes her to see him as a trapped and flawed individual, and she quickly calls off his tormentors.<br /><br />He is alone (his last name, after all, is Solitano), as she is, and he needs someone fiercely--he simply has picked the wrong horse.  For a movie that relies upon gambling so much (more about that later on), is such a metaphorical comparison out of line?<br /><br />It is also at that moment that she witnesses the anguish he feels whenever he hears the Stevie Wonder song \\"My Cherie Amour,\\" which was not only his wedding song but the song playing while his wife and her lover were showering.  Throughout the early part of this movie the song has plagued him, yet it is Tiffany's penchant for cutting through the superficial that causes her to shout, \\"It's just a song; it's not a monster!\\" and it is then he finally begins to place the song in perspective.<br /><br />I have not even touched on the wonderful secondary characters in the movie--and how often can one apply such a term to Robert De Niro?  His character of Pat, Sr., has lost his job and is relying upon bookmaking to fund his construction of a restaurant he has dreamed about running all of his life.  While such a dream drives the action of the second half of \\"Silver Linings,\\" perhaps more important is De Niro's skilled portrayal of a faulted man run by his compulsions, a psychological disorder that also, certainly, had something to do with the Pat's upbringing.  He is a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic; he has recorded and catalogued every game they ever played.  This is odd, but perhaps not worthy of being called \\"crazy\\"; yet we soon find out he has done the same with other items in his house, including blank envelopes. Now, THIS is a compulsion worthy of merit.<br /><br />That Cooper's Pat has trouble with De Niro's Pat is not hard to fathom: after all, his father's repeated pleas to simply spend time with his son at first come across as a man's earnest desire to reconnect with his offspring, and we at first see the younger Pat as being callous for neglecting him.  Yet it is only later that we realize his father really has been harboring a secret motivation: he sees his son as \\"lucky\\" and wants to use him as one of his ever-present talisman.<br /><br />It is wholly appropriate that when this all reaches a peak, it is Tiffany who sees them through it.<br />In fact, a few revelations later we find it is, as usual, the women who have been pulling the strings all along.  Not only did Tiffany, as she put it, \\"do my research\\" and point out to Pat, Sr. that his son has been a good luck talisman all along when in HER presence, but we find too that it is Pat's mother who had secretly helped Tiffany corner Pat all along.<br /><br />But the climactic scenes, wherein EVERYTHING comes to a head--the relationship, the dance contest, the restaurant wager and the all-important meeting between Pat and his ex-wife Nikki--Tiffany and Pat finally reveal to each other their love.  \\"I loved you when I first met you,\\" he declares, \\"I just didn't know it at the time.\\"<br /><br />This is where the movie at once and at last unites with Hollywood and gives us the \\"proper\\" ending we've hoped for all along--against Hemingway's nihilism and against the cynicism one might expect here.  It is proper, though, that this one hope goes along with Hemingway's famous quote from \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (as long as one doesn't read much farther): \\"The world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong in the broken places.\\"<br /><br />It is quite possible to see just how Pat and Tiffany are, indeed, \\"stronger at the broken places,\\" and may now achieve their Hollywood ending after all.<br /><br />  *  *  *  *  *<br /><br />NOTE: As I write this, Jennifer Lawrence has just picked up a Golden Globe for her stellar performance (it was up for four); that Bradley cooper lost to Daniel Day Lewis in \\"Lincoln\\" is nothing to be ashamed of.  It is nominated for eight Academy Awards, including the acting quartet, director, adapted screenplay, film editing, and...oh, yes: Best Picture.<br /><br />It achieved an American Film Institute Movie of the Year, and is up for four Screen Actors Guild Awards (Actress, Actor, Supporting Actor, and--the one I love--Best Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture; last year's winner was [[ASIN:B005J6LKVI The Help (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]).ut, \\"It's just a song; it's not a monster!\\" and it is then he finally begins to place the song in perspective.<br /><br />I have not even touched on the wonderful secondary characters in the movie--and how often can one apply such a term to Robert De Niro?

It is proper, though, that this one hope goes along with Hemingway's famous quote from \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (as long as one doesn't read much farther): \\"The world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong in the broken places.\\"<br /><br />It is quite possible to see just how Pat and Tiffany are, indeed, \\"stronger at the broken places,\\" and may now achieve their Hollywood ending after all.<br /><br />  *  *  *  *  *<br /><br />NOTE: As I write this, Jennifer Lawrence has just picked up a Golden Globe for her stellar performance (it was up for four); that Bradley cooper lost to Daniel Day Lewis in \\"Lincoln\\" is nothing to be ashamed of.  It is nominated for eight Academy Awards, including the acting quartet, director, adapted screenplay, film editing, and...oh, yes: Best Picture.<br /><br />It achieved an American Film Institute Movie of the Year, and is up for four Screen Actors Guild Awards (Actress, Actor, Supporting Actor, and--the one I love--Best Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture; last year's winner was [[ASIN:B005J6LKVI The Help (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]).
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Loved it, very entertaining, great performance by Kevin Costner and certainly magical signing by Whitney Houston.  Wish there is a second series to it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|NOTE: This review DOES NOT contain SPOILERS!<br /><br />Do you remember when you were a young student reading your history textbook and--while you had been up until that moment viewing artists' renditions of famous events and people--you were now in the latter half of the 19th century, and you'd reached the portion of your history text when there were actual photos of these events?<br /><br />In fact, staring at you from the page, is the face of Abraham Lincoln himself.<br /><br />If you do remember such a moment, you might be equally startled by the intimacy and immediacy of \\"Lincoln,\\" a stunning work of art that marries two of cinema's most powerful forces: Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day Lewis.  How is it that these two amazing legends have not worked together before?<br /><br />The power of this film is captured in the single word of the title; this is no \\"The Man, The Myth, The Legend\\" mythology...no sweeping panorama told in glorious panoramic cutaways.  No; it is the story of one man, and how this one man took on one cause, one battle, and fought the good fight away from the dirt and gunpowder of the battlefield, trading it in for the backrooms and chambers of an even more wicked Washington D.C.<br /><br />It is the story behind the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, banning slavery as an institution. It may puzzle modern-day viewers that such an amendment ever had to be written, but HOW it was passed is an amazing story well worth telling. (And it's practically impossible to avoid making parallels with today's President, his House of Representatives, and their conflicts.)<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" is a stirring story, full of intrigue and intelligence, and you will be stirred by the emotional sway conveyed by the camera and the script.  Tony Kushner fashioned the screenplay from Doris Kearn Goodwin's extremely well-research and well-told [[ASIN:B000N2HBSO Team of Rivals]].  As one might expect, it is the story of how Lincoln was compelled to \\"work\\" Washington, how he was able to coerce the varied forces of a warring Union political jungle and make it bend to his will.<br /><br />But it is more than that, and it was this that I found most forceful: the WHY.  And while you think you know it--that it is against human dignity to hold another man's freedom under your thumb--you are of course correct, but also misjudging the ideal for the real, practicality of the amendment.  And when the President lays out his rationale to his cabinet--when he spells out the political REASONS behind the passage of this amendment--it is a stirring, shrewd, and spellbinding moment that is as insightful, intelligent, and (if it were to have failed) as frightening as they come.<br /><br />There were several moments within this movie that moved me like that: one was as tiny as a moment can be, though it occurred at a time that meant as much to American history as any one moment can, and it was simply this: Abraham Lincoln needed a message sent by telegraph, and he found two men in the communications room who were capable of such a thing.  After it was sent, the President of the United States sat with them and conversed, holding them in awe, all while he recounted a lesson he was once taught in math that followed him to this day.<br /><br />And that is the power of this \\"Lincoln.\\"  It takes a great actor, and a great director, to put their considerable skills hard at work at stepping back and letting the man shine.<br /><br />I WAS those telegraph men, mesmerized by the man--Daniel Day Lewis makes him that real.  It is easy to lose oneself in the moment and believe you are sitting with the man.  It is his hard, worn face, his stooped shoulders, his often grim demeanor, his high, reedy voice, his gentle, intelligent eyes...it is all there in Lewis' portrayal.  And his mind...it is a mark of Lewis' portrait of the man that Lincoln's vaunted intelligence always shows through, and the same is true of his compassion.  It is an amazing thing Lewis and Spielberg have accomplished--a film that is stirring when it needs to be, harried and frazzled when it needs to be, and gentle and mindful of the human soul, ALWAYS.<br /><br />As is usual with his films, Spielberg is best when he sets the scene, brings the actor forward, does the grunt work, then steps back and lets the scene play out, mindful of details as minor as a tapping finger or a twinkle in an eye.  From what I have seen of the director's career (and that's just about every movie he's done) it appears that he stresses over every detail, then lets his people do their work, making sure his camera is there to capture every nuance of the moment.  His movies seem so alive, so frames so full of sight and sound that the film seems close to exploding with energy.  It's no different here in \\"Lincoln\\" than it was in [[ASIN:B008XBHIEY Jaws]], [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]], or the dozens of films in between.<br /><br />As is also usual, the film is populated by great actors doing great work.  Sally Field's Mary Todd is a wonder, her ballyhooed \\"madness\\" evident, but in Field's hands it's more the anguish of a mother who has lost one son and fears the loss of another--and is powerless to protect either him or the husband she loves.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as Lincoln's son Robert Todd, was fine in the small but pivotal role as the son who wished not to be protected any longer from the war.<br /><br />But it is Tommy Lee Jones who really steals the frame each time he is present.  He is simply terrific as the bombastic and bewigged Thaddeus Stevens, an ardent abolitionist.  Other noted roles are filled by Hal Holbrook, James Spader, Jackie Earle Haley, S. Epatha Merkerson, Tim Blake Nelson, Bruce McGill, and there are almost countless others.<br /><br />What this film really left me with was the sense that I was there, and so was Lincoln, the man.  When the film ended--and despite its length it ended far too soon--I was struck by how much I would miss him.  And this...the accomplishment of creating a man out of the ether, is really the most remarkable achievement.  I will miss this man Lincoln, but I will always treasure Spielberg and Lewis for giving me this living, breathing man of history.azing thing Lewis and Spielberg have accomplished--a film that is stirring when it needs to be, harried and frazzled when it needs to be, and gentle and mindful of the human soul, ALWAYS.<br /><br />As is usual with his films, Spielberg is best when he sets the scene, brings the actor forward, does the grunt work, then steps back and lets the scene play out, mindful of details as minor as a tapping finger or a twinkle in an eye.

B001NLKZUA|4.0|It was ok. It picked up faster than the first book and there is much more action flowing in this series than the Hunger Games books. Can't wait for the movies to come out!
B00A757EFW|4.0|I like it but what's the point if makes no sender Yahoo I like it I mean it 1980 all over but maybe its a good thing to leave the past in the past
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was funny it made me laugh. I liked the characters and the funny things they did all the time.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This is so good that you feel like crying for two reasons, seeing those guys rocking the hell of that show like if it was 1975 all over again and because the feeling of not having attended the concert is heartbreaking, thanks for releasing this amazing set, I'll sell my soul if they toured to see a show like this live, for now, this bluray combo will do
B0071BY2OG|4.0|I bought this for my husband, and maybe he'd give it a 5 but I think it's only a 4 because it really focuses on only a few of the riders.  Seems to me it could have been a lot better.
B009HG8Z0U|5.0|The Blu-Ray:<br />* Audio/Video = 10/10<br />* Extras = 6/10<br /><br />The Bonus Blu-Ray:<br />* Building a Cinematic Universe = 11/10 - This is the version to get, if you don't want to give Disney your bucks and double dip the previous movies by getting the box set, this is the one to get, the bonus Bluray included in that box is mostly included here as bonus disc. great feature chronicling how this movies came to happen. get it while it last!<br /><br />The Movie, comment as a Marvel Comics fan:<br /><br />This is the kind of things you imagine as a kid, but never actually believe would come to happen, standalone films that resulted in the greatest comic adaptation for the big screen, this kind of movie makes you believe that everything is possible... Civil War, Onslaught, but even if it is just this one, it would be enough, great movie, great cast, not that great plot, but who cares! the characters themselves make the whole movie, I recommend watching the previos movies, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America, if you haven't you're in for a treat culminating in Avengers
B00871C09S|5.0|Rear Window is my favorite movie because of Grace Kelly (stunning!) and Jimmy Stewart. And Thelma Ritter also gives a wonderful supporting performance.  Can't count the number of times I have seen this film and somehow never tire of it. The witty dialogue, the living of life during a hot summer in New York as seen through Stewart's eyes is quite remarkable.  I never owned this movie & decided to add it to my collection this Christmas...
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Don't get me wrong, by no means this is a bad movie, actually it's a 5 star movie compared to so much garbage being released on theaters nowadays, thing is... we are talking about the director of Memento, the master behind Inception, the genius behind The Dark Knight... and by those standards, this is a very weak movie for a Nolan directed Batman flick I was very dissapointed.... the &#34;epic&#34; conclusion wasn't epic at all for me, even a little cliché drama would've been better to get that &#34;epic&#34; finale feel. For a director that really knows how to have a cohesive and interesting plot regarding many characters, I felt there was so much that wasn't needed, Catwoman for instance, but anyway, I'll leave the final judgement to yourself.<br /><br />The Bluray Itself:<br />- Excellent Video/Audio quality<br />- Great Extras, 58 minutes documentary on the batmobile in all it's 5 versions. this whole feature is worth getting this set for.<br />- Another extra is a making of the movie, including a retrospective on ending the saga, this is actually the reason why I got this disc, to see Nolan's explanation or motivation for finishing the trilogy the way he did, I didn't find my answers here, but makes understand better why this movie is the way it is and not the way I expected.
B007MDB548|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my 4 yr old daughter. She really enjoyed this Tinkerbelle movie. I always like to buy the combo that includes the digital copy so we can put it onto our iphones for travel. This combo was really affordable and it's always easy to order through Amazon. I've never had a bad experience so far.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|We missed this episode and we were glad to catch on Amazon. Castle is one of our favorite series. Great cast and writing.
B004I744AS|5.0|Dictionary is the first thing I read in the morning. Weather, horoscope, and word games on the same screen, not to mention the tidbits of useless information to bore your friends with. Great idea.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|I've never stopped loving the movie Phenomenon.  One of my favorite movies when it came out in the cinema.  But the DVD release was always garbage.  No 5.1 and no anamorphic 16x9 picture.  I couldn't believe it when I heard that Disney was releasing this on Blu.  There's no softening of film grain and the picture looks, well, phenomenal !  The soundtrack is great.  Not much in extras but the movie lives on on Bluray.  There's no hidden John Travolta scientology agenda here--just great filmmaking.  And Robert Duvall is awesome, too.  Great cast!
0345803507|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed these books... definitely sparks the imagination.  I would recommend them... I also would recommend the Beauty Series by Ann Rice... great authors... great books
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|This \\"You can do any thing\\" women empowerment thing is getting old. How about setting a more realistic fantasy. I have seen women of this programming closed fist strike a guy 200 lbs heavier than them, not fat, and not understand why the open hand strike they received back was so powerful. Never would I encourage the striking of a woman, but movies like this are the reasons scenarios like that happen. every human being is limited, women, far beyond most men in multi-tasking, are not physically built like men. Other than having a cliche plot, with a bunch of bumbling cowardly men, and a downgraded demonized stay at home mom, this movie really failed to impress me with Pixars real capabilities, like what we see in Finding Nemo and How to Train a Dragon.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|Been eyeing on this device for quite sometime...and didn't think I needed it until we moved to a big house. And with 3 under 5s and one on the way, well I think all that nagging to hubby was worth it. Took me less than 10 minutes to set up. I'm not a tech geek, and the manual was more or less straight forward except it didn't tell me how long the monitor can be used for without plugging in or how long u had to charge it for, until I read a review here.<br />I paired it up bluetooth and wireless, then the first thing I did was took a picture and text it to DH. Great quality. My two have been going in n out of their rooms when it's bed time. Not tonight they didn't! They loved the rainbow colours, the 7 lullabys (so far) and they get to hear my voice when they call me. The delay in sound is about 1/2secs but that's expected! I get the alert messages almost immediately too.<br />Only thing is the night vision seems a little on the white side so that needs improving. Also I wish it was a bit more cheaper so I can get a second one. Maybe they should do a deal for two purchase for the price of one?!<br />We had a baby monitor 5 years ago and hardly used it plus the fact there was the extra black n white monitor that needed batteries and had to be carried around. Now its just my iPhone and the sleek boxed camera in a handy bag! no fuss with endless wires, plugs, antenna,batteries and what have u to assemble!<br />Overall I can't wait for the next addition to arrive so I can test it on him! But with 3 already it's perfect especially now as I can really see the mischief they get up too! Lol...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'd say the writer and the actors, above all, make this show what it is, but the setting and the costumes are outstanding too. I like its swift pace, and the intimate nature of the story development with all the different characters. The show does tend to get a bit soapy from time to time, which is too bad, but it certainly never gets dull.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I chose this book because I am an animal lover.  I have two dogs, and  oftentimes I<br /> catch myself wondering what is going through their heads. I loved this book, and would highly recommend it to any fellow anyone who has fur babies!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I so enjoyed these books - way more than the movie which I say first.  I read all 3 in less than a week, and then read them again!  Didn't want to let the characters go.  Can't wait to see if the make movies out of the other 2 books.  Would really love to see a 4th book, to hear what happens AFTER - the Hunger Games!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I am exploring new genres of books, and stumbled across Child 44. I prefer easy reads...and not having to go back over a paragraph multiple times to make sense of it...this book was perfect for me.  It's was more of a page turner than any I've read before.  I finished this book in two nights, and normally I take a week or so to get through a 500 page novel.  The characters are real, their struggle is intense.  I refuse to give any plot lines away.  One reviewer claims that the book could have done without the twist, but I feel that it enhanced the story.  10/10 would recommend.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This 5th book, continues the quest for the rightful heir to the Throne.  The awaited 5th book, introduces new characters, that further unfolds the fight for the throne. It answers some questions of the past, and provides surprises that leave to asking more question as you wait for book 6.  In addition to wondering what happened to some of your characters from previous books.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The 'did he?' 'did she?' questions don't stop until the last page of this unlikely thriller.  I say  'unlikely' only because it starts out as a very average-feeling tale of the Oprah's Book Club type ... but there's a reason for that!<br /><br />Amy and Nick have recently moved to Carthage, Missouri from New York.  The downturn in their careers is followed by a dissatisfaction with each other, and then Amy goes missing!  I'll say no more about the plot except that it kept me guessing.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Each of these books is long - about 1100 pages or so.  But a story so detailed, with many characters, story lines and plots, that all come together to paint the picture of a place that has families, friends and foes struggling for the power that comes with the throne!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|In a dystopian future, a girl fights for her life in a government-sponsered competition. Not too complex, but a very entertaining read. Check out Stephen King 's The Running Man if you enjoyed this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was the book of the 2012 summer.  Erotic, and explicit in book 1. A Love Story in Book 2. With a nice wrap up to the saga in Book 3.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Morton always has such a wonderful way of surprising the reader with character development, but this book left me feeling a little flat. The ending felt rushed, as if the book was heavily edited there. But , I will always be a huge fan if hers--what a storyteller.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The emotional rollercoaster in this book is fabulous! Just when I thought I had the story figured out-it threw me for a loop! Great read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game in my spare time.  The game does not freeze.  My children are even learning to play this game
B00992CF6W|5.0|when is next update? I love the game so much I could love it. I I I I I<br />I
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My skeptical husband laughed out loud. Kids and I enjoyed it so much we watched it 3 times in 24 hours!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Hilarious movie! Some might find the humor a little silly, especially 40 & up. If you grew up watching Flash Gordon & Star Wars, you'll love it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is so fun, you can buy and breed like 100 dragons, you can compete in competitions, races, and go on quests, the dragons are usually cute or cool, too.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Bought to read to my grandsons, an easy read. They enjoy me reading to them off of my tablet. The only thing missing is the pictures.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|It seems to be the \\"go to\\" series there's days.  I have Two seasons to catch up on, luckily I got them both here!
0385344333|1.0|As a long-standing fan of Lee Child, I am most disappointed in this silly, drawn-out waste of time.  I didn't even finish the book because I didn't care what happened and couldn't take the dialog.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the closest I'll ever get to owning a horse. Love the realism and its lots of fun. So far haven't had any problems and the graphics are very life like.
0688101364|5.0|Amazing cookie recipes.  Just love Rose's introduction.  She writes from the heart and as in all her books her recipes are so precisely written which makes baking so easy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just got it and can't get enough of it! You'll enjoy the nostalgic challenge! Gonna have to try the claw game as well.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like it its fun to do in spare time when I get it witch is rare for me algebra is not my friend
B008458O3S|5.0|A very smooth running, well thought out, well put together game. Overall logical, to keep it easy enough to explore as a beginner, but open enough to keep it challenging throughout the whole game. It's not completely endless, so you can get a sense of progress and accomplishment, but freeform enough that replaying it still proves entertaining.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Glad this was free.  It is not for me Grandson, picked it out and he doesn,t use it either.  Deleted from my Kindle.
B003AYZBM0|4.0|If you liked the movie, you'll love the book! Lead character Richard is a dark mix of relateable and unlikeable. I couldn't put this book down and read through it in a couple of days on the beach. It's the perfect book to read while you're in Thailand. The book is far better than the movie, obviously.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Some realtor's told me about this movie and how angry it made them. This explaines how the housing crisis started and what &#34;didn't&#34; happen to the ones that caused itl
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE it LOVE it LOVE it LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!Thank you creators of this wonderful app!So fun and addicting!Love it soooooooo much!
B00005S6K8|5.0|Love this movie. Have been searching for it forever. Good mixture of Drama and comedy. Fell in love with it years ago
B008YU0AOE|3.0|I really am glad that I have a calculator on my kindle. Even though I don't use it much it's very handy. I know several other people who use their kindles as calculators and they also really like this app. I'm really glad that I downloaded it, especially since it's free.
B005HSL626|5.0|The game has been so much fun.  I encourage everyone to join the fun.  The family can even have its own ninja tournament.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Does everything that you would want it to do, nice choice of sound to wake up to even on the standard free version; good and loud;  a solid alarm clock app, not much else to say here.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is a good-read of course. But I think my expectations were too high after reading the raving reviews. I found the author likes to go over too nitty-gritty details sometimes. In a mystery book, I myself do not like too much of detail for every situation. I felt sometimes those could have been omitted to streamline the book a little.<br />Having said that - the plot is really good. I would recommend my friends too. But this is not a collector's book, I might just advice them to borrow the book from library or from me before going to a vacation.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is awesome I think that it deserves ten stars. Also before you buy it you should read the first one first it is the best
B0000029DD|5.0|I am very happy with this &#34;Grace&#34; CD by Jeff Buckley.  I purchased it for one song, &#34;Hallelujah.&#34;  I wanted to learn the words to the song and I was successful.  It is a great addition to my computer, music library.
B00722Y1EK|4.0|Good tool for monitoring what's going on behind the scenes on your Android. Support its quick to respond for the Pro version. The only problem (besides a bug with logging) is the \\"ICS Hack\\", which places the display in the top notification bar and hides notifications. It also prevents you from moving the location of the display and disables the small pop-up menu.<br /><br />That menu is handy, and it would be a nice addition to be able to disable the tool from it, rather than just setting the opacity to (nearly) invisible.<br /><br />All in all, well worth the 1.99.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I realize now, how little concerts I've been. This was absolutely amazing and I might need to buy it myself. I was shown this movie and it's unreal I loved every single second of this intimat situation. I love you Adele.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy writes in depth about the issues raised in the race for power and control especially with advanced technology available and continuing to emerge.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner<br /><br />Cover Talk: I love this cover. I don't really know what it has to do with the book, but this is one of the times that I actually don't care. I have a thing for blue and butterflies.<br /><br />First Line: \\"Everything about this rooms screams that I don't belong here. \\"<br /><br />Why I Read It: Asheley from Into the Hall of Books wrote a ridiculously amazing review on it a few months ago and I knew I needed it in my life. When it popped up in the ARC stack at work, I took it.<br /><br />Characters: Abby is not a good girl. I'm actually kind of sick of people saying this. Homegirl is 18, has a fake ID and can drink 15 shots of tequila with no problem. She also has a dark side that no one in this school, aside from America, knows about. I'm not saying Abby is bad by any means, but she is not perfect and suits Travis more than people think.<br /><br />Travis is such a hot mess. He has anger issues, commitment issues, jealousy issues. But I'll be damned, that boy seriously loves Abby. He had so many flaws and I fault him for a lot, but one thing I can't fault him for is his determination to get Abby to love him too.<br /><br />Shep is Travis' roommate/cousin and is probably the only reason Travis is still alive and breathing. Shep is definitely my favorite character in this novel. He is the only one sane enough.<br /><br />America is Abby's best friend. She and Abby practically lived together growing up and America is Abby's voice of reason. But sometimes, that voice killed me! Stay away from Travis. Just do him already and get it over with. He's a jerk. He loves you. Oh. My. Word. That woman.<br /><br />Plot/World-building: I really, really wish that in other reviews I read that they would have focused on the amazing story instead of just how terrible Abby and Travis are. Yes, they two are of them are incredibly dysfunctional. But they are crazy about each other and bring out the best in each other. (Also, sometimes the worst.) Aside from their hot mess relationship, there is more going on.<br /><br />A fight club. Oh, yes. Travis is not just known as the campus womanizer, but also the best underground fighter. Let me just admit that I may have swooned a bit during all of the fight scenes. Travis is amazing. Now, one of the reasons he's so amazing is actually a little sad. He was beat up on by his brothers all of the time growing up, but he learned to hold his own.<br /><br />The mob. I don't want to give a lot away with this story line, but Abby has interesting ties to not so savory characters. This bit of the book was actually my favorite.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Abby and Travis are both serious screwed up people. Their relationship is pretty screwed up, but at the same time it's perfect.
B006VREHRS|5.0|I loved him in Fargo. I loved him in the Sopranos. He is a completely different character in each role in spite of his slightly odd appearance.<br />And the show is spectacular eye candy for people who like historical drama.
B004GE1PDW|4.0|I chose 4 stars instead of 5 because it took some time to receive it. I do understand there was Christmas in there though. Overall was in good condition and what I ordered. Would order products from the retailer for sure.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|The marshal arts excellence of Bruce Lee more than makes up for a weak plot and a poorly written script
B0063IH60K|3.0|game itself is typical solitaire. My problem is getting to the game. I have to exit the game from ad and then come back. Pain!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app everyone who isn't are missing out on a great deal and plus it is free even though it says purchasing that is the same thing as downloading and installing .
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun for all ages. The fact that it's free makes it even better. Try it you might like it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|found it very captivating and some what a little graphic but really enjoyed the book. Would recomend it for good reading.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|It would be better if it had more complex challenges. All in all it was really fun. I spent more time then i should have.
B000024ZYP|4.0|I have heard Anouar Brahem first on the solo cd called Madar by Jan Garbarek. I liked the intimate oriental sound he makes on the instrument. This  is the first and the only solo cd by Anouar Brahem that I have perchesed. I like it particularly because I can also appreciate on it deep base by Dave Holland and the excellent pellucid horns by John Surman. The trio sounds nice.
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|Purchased app to convert my old epubs to mobi. The kindle fire still would not read my converted files until after i restarted my Kindle. I Also had to download a file manager app to move them to a different folder. Just a heads up to make it easier for someone else who may be having problems too. Hope the review helps. Works well now that i know these steps.
B003SI3URQ|4.0|I didn't expect much from this.  It was funny, reasonably clever, not scary and even slightly educational.  Not true to the original Greek story, but who is these days?
B0031RSATC|4.0|This is a great insite to what our Med Registrars put up with. A good read if you are in the Medical field and empathy for the profession.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game as soon as it came out at the app store. Nothing but good experiances ever since.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Best book next to the battle of the labyrinth! This would totally make the best movie ever<br />Totally rocks!<br />-max
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very interesting twist based on the broken moth wing premise.  A good read and only partly predictable.  Coming of wisdom tale that has the usual flair of King's writing style.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|This book was great. Just having finished \\"The Death Cure\\" (the third book in James Dashner's series) had thought about what happened before the experiments. This book answered all of my questions about the books.
B00005U122|5.0|Great video of Roger's concert and it brings back memories of early Pink Floyd. I wish I was there. Awesome
B0000024JA|1.0|Ordered on Christmas it still isnt here, guess Im not getting it...or anything else from there.definitly not satisfied at all
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Obtaining this for my Grandchildren was super easy and convient and shipping was free.  I appreciate not having to run out for items like this.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Best of his later books. Interesting story line.  Lots of twists and turns. Nothing more toadd,  just filling out word requirements
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Bought this for a vacation so I'd have something fun to read on the plan since I can never really fall asleep on short flights.  I was expecting a series of non-stop laugh out loud funny stories; and Tina delivered.  The book is full of funny stories and observations, that did make me LOL.<br /><br />The added bonus is I was pleasantly surprised that I also got some good insight into some life lessons.  Not sure why I was surprised;  I know you have to be clever to be funny, and that humor is a great way to make a point.  But it was nice that my light vacation read ended up getting me to think about how I approach life, work and even friendships.  Great Read!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Typical Flynn.  Good story,. Same story line. Fast moving.  Lots of violence. Characters are aging.  Would read another follow up
B0041D843M|5.0|I would unabashedly recommend this book to everyone!  I have researched and read about nutrition my whole life but never found any REAL answers or explanations as to how to eat well for good health as well as sustain our earth. This book removes the haze of confusion of conflicting recommendations by our government and the status quo.  I was blown away by the extensive research and their findings and so ANGRY that this information is being hidden or denied for public consumption.  I am just beginning my journey to vegetarianism and feel so hopeful that this is the best present I could give myself, my family and the world.  This is truly a gift that will keep on giving.

0425252868|5.0|I just completed reading Adam Makos' A Higher Call and I can only say I was absolutely stunned after finishing its final page. I sat quietly for several minutes, staring at the book and flipping through it looking at its pictures again, trying to come to grips with what I had just read. It is a more emotional book than I imagined it would be.<br /><br />Adam has written a stunning, eye-opening, and breathtaking story of the lives of WWII pilots from both sides of the European Theater, and I dare say his is probably the most complete and best accounting I have ever read, especially from the German fighter pilot's side...it is absolutely brilliant. And as one who has been reading WWII and fighter pilot books for 30+ years, it stands head and shoulders above all the others in my opinion.<br /><br />Adam's coverage of the German fighter pilot's side was the most complete I have ever read and it provided new insight into a side of things I never thought I'd be able to read. And American B-17 bomber pilot Charley Brown's insistance that Adam focus on German figher pilot Franz Stigler's side as the real story turned it from an interesting story to a poignant personal story of how things really were. Thank God that Charley Brown knew where the real story was and pushed for it to be told from that point of view. That turned the book from just a very good book into an amazing read.<br /><br />I believe this book has movie potential, it has a story quality seldom seen and I believe it deserves wide dissemination. Adam Makos came out with Hell of a first book, he has a real talent and I look forward to future books by him.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Game trilogy was something I would not have chosen to read if someone had told me it was sort of sci fiction or what could happen one day MAYBE<br />Read the books and you will see what I mean.<br />I purchased it because everyone was raving about it so only bought the first one well before I had finished it I had already purchased the next two.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed it right up to the last page.<br />So great NOT TO HAVE SWEARING AND EXPLICIT SEX SCENES we dont need that forced down our throats everytime we read a book.  Most ladies I know fast forward that type of thing till they get to the end of sometimes the chapters.  Pass this on to your authors if you can.
030758836X|4.0|I'm not sure I have too much more to add to the already extensive positive reviews for this book.  I thought it was a well written, thoroughly engaging psychological thriller by an author who had the guts to make just about every single main character (with the possible exception of Nick's sister) pretty much completely unlikeable.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />I've been perusing the one star reviews and I have to say that, while I understand the complaints from people who enjoyed the book right up until the ending (the twist, the way Amy attaches Nick to her forever seems just a little too convenient), I have to say I don't really understand all the people complaining about how hateful Nick and Amy both are.<br /><br />To me, that's kind of the point.  This is a DARK novel where the characters aren't meant to be liked.  If that's not what you're into (which is completely understandable) look elsewhere.  If you want to know how a sociopath thinks, really get into the mind of someone who cares nothing for anyone but herself and her petty grudges and perceived slights against her, then this is the book for you.  She's a great character at the same time as she is a despicable human being.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has pulled off the amazing feat of making Nick incredibly unlikeable at the same time as you feel bad for him and the way he's being manipulated.<br /><br />As to the people who complain about the diary entries seeming like they're written by a 13 year old, well that's kind of the point.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Gone Girl.  I thought it was entertaining and original and really took the idea of an unreliable narrator and ran with it. It also managed to slip in a little critique of how ridiculous the media is when things like this happen.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot.  I play it when I travel and when my husband is watching sports. To me it is a challenge and I like that.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moU8ZV85YDG237]]This is my first video review which I'm starting on my SHOUT OUT segment on my new show Bells & Bounty, premiering in February.  I've been wanting to shout the wonders of Tim's works for some time since I owe one of the best changes in my life to his first book 4 Hour Work Week.  I hope this review encourages you to read more, learn more, and be more fearless about living the life you want, just as it did for me.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Megan
0765325950|5.0|Before I write my review, I must say that I respect other reviews frustration about a lack of an e-book, but a one-star review is not the best way to do it (overwhelming majority of one-star reviews are for no e-book available).  The author has passed on and will not benefit from this form of constructive criticism, and it may be better to simply post reviews based on one's appreciation of the book.  Myself, most of my books are e-books now, but for this one, I wanted it hardcover for nostalgic reasons ;)<br /><br />I'm one of those readers that has been looking for the ending to the series since 1993.  Some readers are very dedicated to the point of mapping out every dangling plot thread, talking endlessly into the night on forums and social media about conspiracies, and COSPLAYing at various conventions.  Brandon Sanderson himself I believe mentioned benefiting from these fans in putting everything together as he undertook this journey.  For the purposes of this review, let me make it clear I'm not one of these types of fans.  I benefit from their work and discussions on occasion, but I'm not as Dedicated ;)  So realize this is the review of a fairly average reader.<br /><br />The prologue represents the book - a very desperate and seemingly lost situation with barely a glimmer of hope of success, all coming at a monumental (btw, \\"Monumental\\" should have been Thom's word) cost.  I would say a good 70 - 80% of the book was war scenes, from battle sequences to strategy sessions.  I enjoyed all of it, and felt as though I was in the thick of the fighting throughout.<br /><br />A great number of plot threads that I could recall were resolved.  Some others were left open, though I'm not sure which since I didn't check any websites that held these details, nor was I really interested since I just wanted to get to the grand finale anyway =D  I was also pleasantly surprised to have certain assumptions that had paraded throughout the series as fact either challenged or obliterated.<br /><br />This series, at its heart, is about the characters and they don't disappoint.  All the \\"main\\" characters get ample screen time and all are crucial to success.  For those looking for a series where mainstay characters all live, this isn't it.  Look for many deaths throughout.  This is war and there are no favorites.  As for the villains, Demandred lives up to being perhaps the best Forsaken and most feared of them all.  I would have preferred Padan Fain to have had more of a role in affecting outcomes in all battles.<br /><br />On writing style, I think this book had the right balance of pacing and detail I enjoyed from the first six of the series as well as 9 and 11 (books 7, 8, and especially 10 not enjoyable on pacing).  I think words like \\"arabesque\\" and \\"blowhard\\" shouldn't have made the final cut because they're terms unique to the real world, but those are minor details and not worth grouching overly much on.  As far as length goes, I'm one of those people not intimidated or irritated by length, so 900 pages was no big deal.  If it would have gone on for 100 or so more explaining what happens post \\"Last Battle\\", I would have been just fine, but I suppose the fun in this series is in imagining and thinking about the characters long after putting the book down, and I'll likely do that for some time to come =D<br /><br />All-in-all, this book is a five-star book.  I've looked forward to reading this for some time now (20 years), and I'm satisfied and finally at peace with this series (I long stopped reading fantasy fiction after college because of time constraints with work and family, this was the only series left!).  I look forward to one day re-reading the whole series (as I used to when a new book would come out) in its entirety, from start to finish (even the slow books =)<br /><br />A big thank you to Brandon Sanderson for taking on this enormous project, and to Harriet for editing and keeping this going.<br /><br />You did well ;)iterated.<br /><br />This series, at its heart, is about the characters and they don't disappoint.

B007HACDLK|4.0|The only thing that kept flubbing me up was the fac that I think there were to many characters in the book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it's hard to stop once you get going. and the early levels are easy enough for my 4 year old to play.
B00A757EFW|4.0|hard to manage with fingers, it is fun though does not always go the way that you want him too.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Buggy, wouldn't open and crashed my phone each time I tried to use it. Uninstalled and my phone was fine again. Boo.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love this game. It is more difficult here than on facebook. Makes you pay close attention. I would recommend for everyone
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I loved this game when it first came out years ago. Love having it on my Kindle because I don't have to wait on others to play with me.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed it. The kids would come home every day from school flying thru homework to play it. Recommend it.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie was what I expected which was not very good. Had a lot of funny moments and I loved all the actors and actresses in the movie but the movie as a whole was just ok not great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps ever.  It for my iPhone and for my Toshiba tablet.  I really like it on the tablet because the larger area makes it easier to play.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|Great investment. Otter box continues to do a magnificent job at putting insurance into work. Great case for a great phone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, never read a book faster! Suspenseful and couldn't put it down. The ending was a little disappointing but I still really enjoyed the whole book. I would absolutely recommend it.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves the movie.  The price was good and I didn't have to waste gas to drive and buy it somewhere.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this is my favorite book of the series. A lot of things happened that I was not expecting an  the roles of many characters had changed. I also loves the fact the ending was not a fairytale. Through the entire book I could not predict what was going to happen. This book was much more sad and morbid than the others, but the story was amazing and really makes you feel the same emotions of the characters throughout the book. You know it's a good sign when your heart is beating faster when you read certain scenes.
B004QL7K70|4.0|Bought this for my daughter, she loves the movie and I didn't have to leave home to buy it.  The price was no different than buying from a store.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This band is amazing.  The lead singer has an incredible voice.  Every song on this CD is a keeper.  Destined to be a classic.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Watched this the other night and it was a pretty good money.  Funny and entertaining and the price was good for not having to leave my home to buy.
B004BG0AEA|5.0|i loved it just reminds me how amazing and timeless that it is and reminds me why i became a bonjovi fan and whyi will<br />always,will be a bonjovi fan.<br /><br />  stacie stafford
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game immeadiately grabs your attention and you are instantly hooked. one of the best free games I have ever played. high recommendation!
B008SVFX96|5.0|richie keeps getting better and better with every solo album richie and jon are great singer and songwritters together to<br />see, richie solo you see how truly amazing he is it truly shines i so proud to be his fan.<br /><br />  stacie stafford
B000784WMW|5.0|This is a dark, romantic series on Jane Eyre.  I like the good character of Jane.  Love this series - worth the watch!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Definitely recommend this CD, there are some really good songs on this one. Bleeding Out, Every Night, Demons, Radioactive, Tiptoe are are all standouts. Actually, looking at the list of songs again, I recommend them all.
1400052181|5.0|Very, very, interesting book. I think the colleges are now making it a requirement to read this, as they should! It brings up a lot of moral questions, while at the same time telling a fascinating story. I loved this book!
0307887448|5.0|Easily one of the best, if not THE best, book I have ever read. I devoured it. It's been years since a book hooked me this hard. I recommend it not just for fans of 80s culture, classic video games, geek and nerd culture, and awesome movies, but for everybody!
B001F4UHGC|1.0|The quality of the sound recording is worst. The sound level fluctuates constantly. Either it is so low you cant hear what they are saying or it is so high it rattles the windows. Buy it somewhere else.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie was alright. Lot's of action and similar to the first three. I had some issues with the story-line.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I was unable to watch the entire movie due to poor streaming quality.  I will bwe upgrading my internet soon and will see if it was an issue on my end or amazons.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I really like the music produced by Fun. Please with my purchase and am able to play this on my Android device.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I thought this was a wonderful book and sped through it as fast as I could.  I also enjoyed Ken Follett's first book on the Century Trilogy.  Can't wait until Book Three is available.  Ken Follett is a terrific author and I have read many of his books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is such a good book! Not at all what I expected but it was wonderful! It made me cry, made me smile, and made a 15 hour flight feel a lot shorter!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I thought it would be good for looking up books but you can't type in the word and have it magically appear. I would recommend using Dictionary.com or just Google.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have had a really hard time finding an automatic watch that is an acceptable size for my scrawny wrists. I'm a guy, but I'm 5'6\\" and under 120 lbs. I had tried many other places and all I found was huge watches of 42 mm and up which is just too big for me. This is the perfect size for my everyday watch and I hope to have it for a very long time.
B006YC74E8|3.0|This app is okay if you're into editing most of your pictures.  I don't take much pictures so I don't use the app often.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was an interesting read and at times hard to put down. At other times hard not to through. I can now see what all the hoopla was about. Really good trilogy.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love this app because when I'm in the store and I hear a song I like I could use Shazam to tell me what so it is and purchase it.  So convenient.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was an interesting read and at times hard to put down. At other times hard not to through. I can now see what all the hoopla was about. Really good trilogy.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Just wonderful! Definitely a great read for anyone young or old. Makes you feel like a kid again, I loved it!
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|would have went a 5 star rating but not when you half to order a second order when the first should be A1 ,Just like food it should be A1 when I order the first time should never half to reorder looks bad on a company
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I downloaded the free version which has the first ten levels.  It's a fairly easy game for young kids to play.  I enjoy it as a distraction - something to do to wind down and relax.  The graphics are cute and the program runs smoothly on my Samsung Galaxy Tab.  I wouldn't pay 2.99 for it, though.  That's too pricey for a game that doesn't have a lot of depth.  Great game for free or 99 cents!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was such a gripping book. It was almost impossible to put down! I'm normally good at predicting the plot turns in a book, but this one kept surprising me and keeping my attention as I wondered \\"What comes next?!?!\\"
B0073QQ3X2|5.0|This was a replacement Apatosaurus and I liked it better because of the medium size and general look.  The boys were very happy with it as well.
1567184855|5.0|This, and the follow up book by Michael Newton, &#34;Destiny of Souls&#34;.  The accounts detailed in the books are very well studied over a 30 year practice done by Dr Newton, and he does a superior job in writing and informing of the accounts.  These books changed my life.  I have given away so many copies of each, and intend to keep the next ones I buy!  They are books I think everyone would do well to read.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Great album...shipping was very fast and the package came in perfect conditions...it was a beautiful gift for Christmas...my youngest brother loved it!
0913866156|4.0|...Tarot of the Stars, based upon the Thoth deck and closely following its imagery.  So, I have to give props to the Thoth deck as the pioneer, but my preference for reading is the Liber T Tarot of the Stars.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have had this cover for a few weeks now and it is great! The quality level is perfect and it fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. Looks the same as in the picture & arrived the same day it was promised. You can not go wrong if you decide to purchase this.
1572814136|5.0|...is Classic in the truest sense of the word.  I use a Thoth based deck now, but would not trade the initial experience of Tarot with a classical deck.  To begin, as such, certainly helps to form a very good foundation upon which to build in the world of Tarot.  To be truly &#34;informed&#34; one must be open to consider all realms of thought and interpretation.
B003VS0CX8|4.0|I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO WATCH ALL OF THE SOUND OF MUSIC YET, BUT WHAT I HAVE, I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I will watch The Notebook again some day, I am sure... for I used to own this movie (until I gave it to my daughter), and now I aspire to own it again one day!  A very touching story of love that endures for all time.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Really liked it, kept me guessing till the end!  Need to get a few chapters in to really get a feel for the book.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|What a fun and charming way to spend a couple of entertainment hours!  This movie I would find appropriate for all ages - did I say charming?  ...and funny, artistic, and clever.  I've watched it twice, and will probably see it again one day.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|Bruce Willis just gets better with age and I love his smile.  Again, he is witty and awesome, just like everything else he does.
B001HN697M|5.0|...ALL the Underworld movies!  Unfortunately I gave them all to my daughter, which I regret today, because now I have to replace them all.  Waaa...
B001EN71CW|5.0|I had to check out this series to find out for myself what all the hype was all about. It definitely has a lot of stuff that is missing from television these days with the trend towards reality shows. I'm only through the first 5 episodes of the series and can't wait for free time to sit back and enjoy each one. I will be planning on getting the movie when it comes on sale.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a really nice game. Makes you think without wanting to throw your device against a cinder block. The different puddings make for a strategic gameplay,and their goofy character makes it endearing. Best of all there isn't a plethora of ads. Just a full screen ad every four or so puzzles that is not only easily exited out of,but it's also not obnoxious. It even made me aware of a free Final Fantasy game so *gasp* it was useful. Pretty awesome job,developers. Thanks for the game,and keep up the good work
B006CHML4I|5.0|This watch is indeed beautiful when you see it in person that pictures can't really show. Getting the watch set up the first few days was indeed troublesome, but got easier when the date progressed at reasonable time periods. This watch just might be the one that will start my never-ending fall of watch acquisition.
140053271X|5.0|I was impressed with the ease of set up for this product. I like the fact that I could do the complete registration right on the device and did not need to complete separate phone call/computer steps. I basically had my device up and running within minutes of charging.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great reading so far,looking forward to reading more of it! Lee Child, keeps you interested,alittle crazy at times. Makes you wonder,what the other books will be like!
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Water gets in from bottom latch. Was disappointed . But it does keep sand out and phone is mostly easy to use with cover on. Not what is advertised. Paid too much.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Believe it or not,I have just met Rebus.Ian Rankin knows how to write a great police procedural. Think of all the fun I am going to have reading all the older Rebus books.
B007R21JJK|4.0|I've had this motherboard for 4 months now and it's been running fantastic, except for a driver issue, which I'll get to. I was making a new computer for my 3Ds Max modeling work station and really wanted a motherboard that was up to date with all of today's latest technology and this mobo was the oasis in the desert of high priced motherboards for the budget PC enthusiast. The first 2 months of use was good; my computer ran alright and I could do heavy multitasking without any performance issues or errors/glitches.<br /><br />It's been very stable up until I would get random system freezes (running Windows 7 by the way) and I would have to do a hard reset, only to get another complete system freeze a half hour later. Usually I wouldn't care about problems like these unless they're persistent, in which case I'd rabidly troubleshoot the problem for hours, accumulated into as long as a full blown day to fix the problem. I had made a temporary fix (somehow) until 3.5 months of use, when the problem came back with a vengeance and my system would freeze 2 minutes after logging into Windows. After using a friends computer (since mine was OOA), I had found that this motherboard uses 2 different drivers on its rear 6 USB slots. The above 4 are driven by the VIA PCI driver, rather than Intel USB3 driver. Having pin-pointed the problem, I was able to find that many others with this motherboard have had the same problem and the cause is that the VIA PCI USB3 driver is disabled in the BIOS or not updated to the latest version.<br /><br />I have since had the problem fixed, and if the problem hadn't existed, I would have given this product a 5 star review. Yet, it was frustrating that it was so hard to know what the problem was. The VIA PCI USB3 driver provided in the drivers disc for the motherboard isn't even compatible with 64 bit operating systems, and they're becoming a standard in today's age. All in all though, if you're looking for a not-so-pricey motherboard that will not bottleneck any of your new hardware, I'd definitely recommend this one, but not without strictly pushing the motion of updating your VIA driver immediately.<br /><br />Just as an afterthought, the problem I've had could be specific to my hardware, and the likeliness of anyone reproducing the problem might be less if the build is different from mine.<br />- Intel i7 3770k<br />- Nvidia GTX 670<br />- OCZ Fatal1ty 750W Modular Gaming 80PLUS Bronze<br />- Corsair Vengeance Blue 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM Dual Channel Memory Kit CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B<br />- Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Sound Card<br />- (2 HDDs\RAID 0) Seagate Momentus XT 750 GB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST750LX003ot bottleneck any of your new hardware, I'd definitely recommend this one, but not without strictly pushing the motion of updating your VIA driver immediately.<br /><br />Just as an afterthought, the problem I've had could be specific to my hardware, and the likeliness of anyone reproducing the problem might be less if the build is different from mine.<br />- Intel i7 3770k<br />- Nvidia GTX 670<br />- OCZ Fatal1ty 750W Modular Gaming 80PLUS Bronze<br />- Corsair Vengeance Blue 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM Dual Channel Memory Kit CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B<br />- Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Sound Card<br />- (2 HDDs\RAID 0) Seagate Momentus XT 750 GB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST750LX003

B00451VH8E|4.0|I have seen this film many times while growing up and have always enjoyed it. It is an excellent blend of classical music and Walt Disney visuals, with a sprinkling of humor. My favorite vignette(classical interpretation)is Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, the \\"Pastoral\\".Perfect.I highly recommend this DVD to adults and children.
B003JRD5JO|5.0|Loved this album as a kid and love it now at 31....My kids get into and even my daughter's furby starts dancing to some Bon Jovi!
B009KWL0YE|3.0|I bought this film because i had not seen it since it came out in 1969, and i had fond memories of the great music (Badfinger and Thunderclap Newman amongst others), and great cameos (Raquel Welch amongst others) and it was very satisfying in those regards. However,the film is very scattered in it's energies and rather unfocused on it's main message: money is the root of all evil,and the common masses will do anything for it (well, typical message for 1969.) I would recommend it, but only mildly.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Very predictable.  Really don't enjoy reading books with teen characters.  It did keep my attention while walking on the tredmill.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is simply amazing and the picture/audio quality is first class.  I absolutely love the convenience and dependability of amazon instant video and I am proud to be a valued customer.  I would recommend this product to any and all fans of the show.  It saves the time of waiting on a DVD purchase.
B00A0L7PE8|5.0|Been a huge fan of Prince for years, and I was really excited about this new release. The song reminds me of 'Old School' , but with a kick to it. Prince's smooth voice in this selection is  undeniably brilliant. Great to hear Prince jump out of his classic style and move on with it. He unleashed a brilliant masterpiece with this lyrically, if you listen closely to the lyrics . Not only that, the video production is fun and love that look of confidence in Prince's face with that subtle touch of mischievousness. Simply put, Prince has a hit with this and so happy this eclectic genius has once again unleashed us something decent to listen to.
0547848412|3.0|I love stories about animals, and tigers are my personal favorite beast, so this seemed like a perfect fit for me!  I saw the movie posters with the tiger on the boat and WOW, I gotta see that film!  But I never got around to seeing a film, I bought a book on my Kindle and read it instead.  Here is what happened WITH SPOILERS:<br /><br />A teenage boy in India grows up with his family's zoo and then gets religion.  He sees no conflict with being Hindu, Muslim, and Christian all at once and his family is baffled. He does not sound like many teenagers I know, but hey he's weird.  All the info about zoos and zoology were neat for me, since I like animals so much, but the strange religious zeal of Pi (who is named after a swimming pool, huh) has no logical tie with the zoo story.<br /><br />Then the shipwreck and his family is sailing across the Pacific.  Why were the zoo animals aboard the SAME SHIP with the family moving to Canada and why did they take a cargo ship in the first place?  No explanation.  No one knows why the ship sank either.  Pi ends up on a lifeboat with a zebra, a tiger, a hyena, and an orangutan.  Which defies belief, but OK I played along...the animals start killing eachother and Pi makes a raft to get away from the tiger.<br /><br />Then a long time is spent drifting and suffering in the middle of the Pacific...it was harsh and Pi barely survives, but strangely no one gets skurvy? Or maybe he does. After 227 days at sea with ne real shelter I am amazed he did not have life-long health problems.  But Pi is weird...he is oddly happy despite his family's death because the sky is so pretty and God is watching him.  Perhaps delirium has set in?  His main problem is not being eaten by the tiger...who is also calm for a cat on a lifeboat.  I know cats and this seemed like hoopla.  Cats freak out in moving vans, how would they survive in a lifeboat for 227 days?  Most likely the tiger would claw the boat apart in panic.<br /><br />But onward.  A weird vegetable island appears and it is covered with meerkats.  WHAT.  This is where things fell down the rabbit hole and I could no longer suspend belief.  It was a cool idea and I like that the island tried to eat him, but this is the point where I began to doubt everything Pi said.  Good that I did.<br /><br />When Pi ends up in Mexico the tiger disappears (metaphor?) and two men investigate what happened since the ship sank.  Pi tells two stories, and it turns out he made up the one with the animals in it.  In reality those animals were all people on the lifeboat and Pi was the tiger.  AAARRGH!!!  What a huge disappointment...but also a relief.  I was glad that those animals were never on that boat because it was too hard to accept their behavior at all.  People would make more sense, and so now the story (in retrospect) was about how people become beasts when put to the test.<br /><br />That saved the story for me.  It was an allegory, which I can appreciate.<br /><br />As for the claim that this is the same as belief in God or the book will make you believe in God, give it up.  I get what the author is driving at and he missed the whole street.  This book makes religion look silly.<br /><br />I liked the book, can you dig it?  It is an enjoyable read and the twist makes it more plausible after the fact.  I did not like the parts about religion or faith since they were frankly demeaning, and the author wants us to agree with Pi that faith = fairy stories.  But I would recommend this novel and the fiction it is: a story of humans turned bestial to survive.

B0059XTUXQ|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever made about Lady Thatcher.  It portrays her as an almost insignificant and pitiful weak woman who is out of her mind.  Further, her actions with Reagan to bring about the end of the cold war are all but unmentioned.  Rather, the writer and director go out of their way to make her look irrelevant.  This is, in no uncertain terms, an abomination on film.  One of the worst movies I have ever sat through. I would give it NO stars...but that is not an option.
0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this book & the series!  Its a pretty fast & easy read that is hard to put down!  I'd highly recommend it!  For whatever reason, it was cheaper to buy all 3 books separate rather than as a set so keep that in mind if you plan on purchasing all of them.
B007REV4YI|1.0|While watching SkyFall in the theater, there were just too many similarities with The Dark Knight.  It was to the point where a friend and I looked at each other and started discussing it.  To see just how similar these two movies are, I provided a link to a site that discusses it.  Very disappointing that this movie copied so heavily from The Dark Knight.    [...]

B004QX07G4|3.0|It is as if you are having a one on one conversation with Ellen and she is just talking away.  Sometimes I laughed out loud and really enjoyed her thoughts.  However, there is not much substance, just her random thoughts.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I really enjoyed the book despite the foreboding feeling I had from the prologue that I wasn't going to be happy with the sad ending. The book reminded me of The Help in that it described the trials of growing up and living in the south as an African American. The characters were believable and lovable. I thought the parallel that ran through the book that described the lack of freedom and equality that neither the &#34;nigras&#34;, women, or Irish indentured servants had. I thought the book was interesting and easy to read and would appeal to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and learning about the struggles of humanity through the years. I would have given it 5 stars but thought that the ending could have been more powerful.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|my niece absolutely loved this gift. she loves the fact that it has a mirror to look at herself, and she can play with it for hours!
B009VB9VKY|4.0|This movie was more than I expected. It had a couple good story lines going and was suspenseful while pleasing to the eye. ;)
B000UR9T82|4.0|You'll get what you expect. The picture quality is great and everything is on point.<br /><br />The only reason it's not great is because the first two films don't contain any extra features of<br />the movie, with the exception of Spider-Man 3.<br /><br />Anyhow, you'll get what you paid for.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|I could've gone without seeing this movie; although, Tom Cruise does put on a really good performance. If you're into 80's music, then you'll probably like it. I, myself, only like a few songs from the 80's.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've been using Evernote for my Kindle Fire for about 10 months now. It's lovely, but I really wish the WebClipper feature was made available for my browser. I use this app to jot down and keep track of things that inspire me, and the ability to insert links into my notes would make it perfect. I can't even copy-paste a link into a note, there's no option for that. Please, Evernote team - fix this!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love Draw Something. On my droid it  works great, but not on my kindle fire. i get some pop up saying 'marmelade' and lose games. i have lost games in the 100's because of this!!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This is a wonderful album, the music is very compelling. Nice to listen to while reading just about any story.
B006YC74E8|3.0|Takes pictures and is similar to HD Camera but has more features to edit your pictures.  From that standpoint it's better than the HD Camera app.  On the otherhand the HD Camera allows you to take video's and includes both picture as well as sound.  Neither product is that great because the camera on the HD has such a low MP quality.  Finally, there are so few APPs out there for the kindle.  None of this is bad for a first attempt from Amazon.  I hope that future products with have bopth a front and back camera like the Nexus 10 and with higher resolution.  Regradless I still like the Kindle compared to either the IPAD or Nexus beacuse you can do so much with it compared to the others.  Great products for families of all ages.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read all three of the 50 Shades books.  Book two started to feel dull ... the same thing over and over again as told by a wide-eyed college twit.  #2 is the worst of the three.. but if you intend to read all three.. you have to get thru this one to know what is going on in #3.  Three at least has a little bit of a story line... but had I known how everything was going to turn out... I would have stopped at #1.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good app if you want to check when charging you must buy it to have a good review by me.
B000002J0B|4.0|`Houses of the Holy' was released on 28th March 1973 (the same week as Pink Floyd's `Dark Side of the Moon') to a less than uncritically enthusiastic reception, the first Zeppelin album not greeted by universal acclaim.<br /><br />The reason for this lukewarm reception was that the band refused to do `more of the same' and decided to experiment a bit with different styles, and the dyed-in-the-wool hard rockers didn't like it.<br /><br />The result is a mixed bag, with a few really stand-out songs: `The Song Remains the Same' and `Dancing Days' are amongst Zeppelin's best rockers, and `No Quarter' is an eerie dark mood-piece in a minor key which, though rarely performed onstage, remains one of the band's most distinctive numbers. `Over the Hills & Far Away', the love song `The Rain Song' and the closer `The Ocean' are also good.<br /><br />Where the album comes unstuck for some fans is with the musical experiments `The Crunge' and the reggae-rhythm `D'yer Mak'er' which granted, are not among Zeppelin's best output. But they at least demonstrate the band's multi-dimensional musical reach, and their refusal to be pigeon-holed.<br /><br />Some compositions laid down in the 1972 recording sessions (including the title track `Houses of the Holy') didn't make the final mix, but were re-worked and later released on the 1975 epic `Physical Graffiti' - though in the meantime were performed regularly by the band onstage.<br /><br />Overall `Houses of the Holy' is an uneven but nevertheless very good album, with some fine songs.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The body count was too low, not enough bad guys were killed.  Oh Yea, and there needs to be more blood splattering all over the place when bad guys are shot !
B000002J09|5.0|This 1971 album is judged by many to be Zeppelin's best, and most consider `Stairway' to be their all-time greatest song (it's certainly the best known).<br /><br />`Zep 4' is however more than just `Stairway': it's a collection of fine numbers, with no flat spots. There's great rock music in `Rock & Roll' & `Misty Mountain Hop' plus the interesting opener `Black Dog' with its 3-part structure & unconventional rhythms. There are some memorable acoustic-folkie songs: `The Battle of Evermore' dominated instrumentally by mandolin & one of the very rare occasions when the band used a female singer (Sandy Denny) to harmonise with Robert Plant, and the sublime `Goin' to California'. The dark & heavy `Four Sticks' has Bonzo playing with 4 drumsticks throughout the action, and the epic closer `When the Levee Breaks' rounds things off in great style. When so much music from the intervening decades now sounds dated, this still sounds fresh and interesting.<br /><br />Now: is the 2014 `2-CD Deluxe Edition' worth buying, or should you stick with your old CD or vinyl?<br /><br />The 2-CD release follows the format of its predecessors (1, 2 & 3) in offering the original album remastered on the first CD and a second disk of extra material. The remastering of the original album is fabulous and sounds better than ever, with a deep warm sound and everything in perfect balance. As LZ4 is considered by most to be the zenith of Zep's output containing consistently A1-class material, it's worth buying just for this alone.<br /><br />The second CD contains only alternate takes of the album tracks, in the same running order. Most sound too close to the original songs to be of sustained interest to any but the die-hard Zeppelin obsessive. There are `karaoke' (i.e. no vocals) recordings of `Battle of Evermore' & `Going to California', which highlight the superlative mandolin and acoustic guitar work of Jimmy page and JP Jones. The standout track here though is `Four Sticks' with a more insistent pounding beat from Bonzo and a truly frenetic vocal delivery by Robert Plant. This take ought to have been selected as the original album track IMO.<br /><br />So overall the extra material on disk 2 is mildly disappointing. However if you don't have the original album in your collection, then this 2014 `Deluxe Edition' is the one you should go for. Due to the timeless brilliance of the original album and Jimmy Page's excellent remastering job, it's not possible to award this epic classic less than five stars.<br /><br />The original cover art contained no words whatsoever; the album's title was supposed to be four ancient Icelandic runes. But how are you supposed to pronounce that? The band didn't want this album referred to as `Led Zeppelin 4' but that's exactly what everyone calls it. The 3-gatefold cover offered here lacks the rear cover-art of the original 12\\" vinyl, opting instead for a kind of psychedelic negative of the front cover, a framed photo of the old country guy carrying a bunch of sticks on his back, so doesn't feel as authentic as the other releases in the series. The 16-page booklet contains mostly photos of the band on stage, plus a replica of the original rough grey album sleeve containing the lyrics to `Stairway', and a splendidly nostalgic full-colour image of the `Electric Magic' poster for the 1971-11-20 gig at The Empire Pool, Wembley. Ah, the memories.o and a truly frenetic vocal delivery by Robert Plant. This take ought to have been selected as the original album track IMO.

B0084AZXKK|5.0|I loved the book<br />The book was a really good book to read and you should read it to good bye
B000ATQYT2|5.0|On Time<br />Great Purchase Its a Christmas tradition at our house. I recommend  it for any body who likes the Muppet's.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was Amazing! Just like the first two books. I love the series and the way it played out.
0988262592|5.0|Full Disclosure: I was an early reviewer of this tremendous book.<br /><br />Having been an early reviewer has made the wait for its release so incredibly difficult because I truly believe that EVERYONE must read this book. This is like no other \\"techie\\" book because it reads like a Clancy or Ludlum novel especially in regard to the drama and carnage that it leaves behind. You will very likely read it in one sitting. It is THAT GOOD. There is not one person who I have mentioned this book to since I reviewed it that hasn't related to the storyline and simply asked \\"When can I buy it?\\" I can finally answer that question, right now.<br /><br />When you read this book, you will have nightmares because it will bring back all those horrible scenarios you survived in your career. If you don't have nightmares and can't relate to this book, you could not possible have worked in IT.<br /><br />The authors do an incredible job of intertwining fundamental principles of manufacturing processes, Theory of Constraints, and Kanban into a story line that makes this book so unique. They pulled together the characteristics of real people from their past experiences as well as real life stories/scenarios they were familiar with to form a cast of characters and storyline that you can see yourself in the middle of. So much so that you will likely pause while reading it and say to yourself \\"OMG, Steve is my manager from 10 years ago\\" or \\"WOW, I just finished dealing with 'Sarah' in my own meeting with marketing 2 hours ago\\". It really is that scary, you can and will replace the character names with people from your past.<br /><br />Simply put..... this is not only a MUST READ, it is a \\"keep it on the shelf\\" book that you will recommend to people for years to come. Buy it, don't wait.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was absolutely great and a very fast read! You won't be disappointed! Even better that it is free!
034580404X|3.0|I have not had a chance to read this for myself, but the books themselves and the packaging appear of good quality.
0345803507|5.0|I loved the ending of the third book but it still left me wanting more! From the beginning I was intrigued by the story line. Of course it is a little racy. I have recommend these books to everyone I know!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Received item two days after ordering - timely for a Christmas gift. .  Excellent series - have recommended to all my friends.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Downing Jr. and Law work amazingly well as Sherlock and Watson. These two actors make the movie worth watching. A much better movie than the first.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I really liked the book but a little obvious that when Jace died he would come back to life, I mean he is one of the main characters he couldn't remain dead.
B0087HT36U|4.0|however there are a couple levels u may need to spend more money to pass. its worth it and its not an easy difficulty.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I freaking loved this book its a page turner and you always wanna know whats gonna happen next... its great
0439023483|5.0|Was in college when I first read this book. IT was my first pleasure read since my first day of higher education. Would walk to class reading it. Once I read the first, of course the others followed without hesitation. An interesting, enjoyable series.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|The writing was very simple, the main character was simple as well and the story somewhat predictable but I liked it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I Ike the book. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it an 8. It bods your interest.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Intertainment.<br /><br />We felt compelled to keep watching these episodes until it was time to go to bed each night until we had watched them all. That is entertainment.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoy the game but I hate that I am forced to spend if I want to keep up with the game. now how can I get investment credits without paying.
B008J05EL8|1.0|......I think it is crappy to pay for something that should have been included in the original app, which is already priced on the higher end for an app.
B000I9U8VO|5.0|Excellent 2nd chapter to the X-Men story and it looks great on blu-ray x-men fans will love it and want more.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and was hoping to read the second book and follow the hero Thorgrin on his next learning adventure.  It does follow the standard theme of a young hero leaving home with little prospects and learning he is much more than he ever expected, but Rice builds an interesting world with intriguing characters building mystery, intrigue, friendships, and a love interest.  There are several ways the author can  take the story and its characters.  Some have been foreshadowed and are expected, but there could be some twists.  I'm looking forward to the next book as I found the first entertaining.
0756655307|5.0|This book totally surpassed my expectations. It is a large (heavy) book jammed packed with quality illustrations. I bought it as a gift but it's so nice that it makes me want one for myself...and I don't even follow Marvel.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I saw this at the cinema and just wanted to buy it to watch when I need a little dose of summertime, sweetness, and adventure. Plus it's just a darn beautiful film.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|We were able to start a new family tradition of a polar express movie night with all our family now that my daughter is old enough to be into movies. She loved it and watched it many times this holiday season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really don't watch TV.  I find most of it drivel, but I love love love Downton Abbey.  I love how it moves us through the passage of time, how the characters evolve with change, their struggles, and the many storylines that exist.  We get a fantastic view into the upstairs and the downstairs of the English past.  If you love costumes then you will be in love.  The costuming is absolutely exquisite.  The work on these is amazing.  Once again the show how styles changed through time is beautifully done.  They respect the various age groups and the research here is fantastic.  The acting is fabulous.  We are so lucky to have such great people working together.  I am not very eloquent and this show deserves eloquence.  If you do watch it try and see it from the beginning so you can love each time period all the trials and tribulations and also the joys.  I don't miss an episode.  When I am not home I catch up by buying the episode on Amazon and watching it instantly.  I've also pre-ordered the seasons over the past years.  Don't miss this series.  It is another one of the BBC genius pieces that will long remain as a world wide favorite.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|In this season of Downton Abbey, the world faces the horrors of World War I--the first episode if modern warfare. The shows accurately and very Interestingly explores the effects of total war on high-class British society, as well as the after effects if war on society in general--fashions, feminism, class divisions, etc. it gives a stunning perspective of life in the trenches while at the same time expressing the horrors of those confined to home. It's a wonderful season of many perspectives and twists that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone interested in the era--be it for styles, technology,  or simply an interesting history lesson.
B000ICM5O4|5.0|Whether you liked the movie or not, this soundtrack is magnificent. The U.S. Marine Corp Band is surpassed by none and these arrangements are phenomenal. If you like brass, you'll love this!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was great. It was hard in the begging to get into. But as I kept reading I found it hard to put it down.
B00006AW2O|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. They used to knock out albums every few months back in the day, now you have to wait years. This album followed up their debut about 6 months later. Like their first album, most of the songs are cover tunes of songs they loved and played as they were coming up in England, but here are a few original compositions starting to creep into the line up - the beginnings of one of the most successful song writing tandems in music history. This album was recorded probably much the same way as the first - a few days in a studio, pretty much live to tape, knocking it out without a lot of frills or time, then add in a few singles previously recorded and released as 45's and you have an album. This is a good bunch of songs and it just might be my favorite among the early 5 albums that mark the start of their recording career (England's Newest Hit Makers, 12 x 5, The Rolling Stones - Now!, Out of Our Heads, December's Children).  I have always loved \\"Empty Heart\\" and it is my personal favorite here, but the version of \\"Susie Q\\" is just unbelievable to behold as well. This up tempo version - reminiscent of their take on \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\" from their debut - just blows the door off the car. How they hold this together is just amazing - because again, they probably took just few takes and it was probably pretty much live to tape. I can't imagine how that song must have come across live in a club. Very, very cool version of the song and a real showcase of how tight the Stones were as a band. You also have here their classics \\"Time Is On My Side\\", \\"It's All Over Now\\" and \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" - and they are good songs, but my other favorites are \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\", \\"Around and Around\\" and \\"Congratulations\\" - those are the ones that I listen to along with \\"Empty\\" and \\"Susie\\". The album is loaded with the goods and is again proof positive that their success was not an accident.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had so much depth. It will strike your heart unmercifully and make you feel emotions so strong that it will feel like an empathy.
B00006AW2S|4.0|I am the Stones Authority.  Here we are well into 1965. This album is a big deal for a couple of reasons. And those couple of reasons were two of the original compositions included on this album - \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"The Last Time\\".  These are still today two of their biggest hits and both have stood the test of time. I feel like I am sort of stating the obvious with \\"Satisfaction\\", which is one of the all time iconic rock and roll songs and one of the biggest hits of all time. Everyone knows that song. And remarkable still is the fact that - unlike so many songs of the era that come across dated - it has aged very well. That song sounds like it belongs - even today. It is timeless. It is perfect. There are not a lot of songs from 1965 - even from the Beatles - that get regular rotation play on radio stations not strictly dedicated to the era. This song is still in regular radio rotation on every mainstream rock station. Not bad for a couple of guys just starting out as song writers. The distribution between the blues covers and their originals is, for the first time, equally weighted. Going forward there would no longer be the heavy reliance on covering other artists material to fill out their albums or their live shows. On this album there are still many of the blues standards that established the band's reputation and got the stone rolling, such as the terrific version of \\"Mercy, Mercy\\", \\"Hitch Hike\\" and \\"Good Times\\", but this album is the shot across the bow that heralded that the Rolling Stones had arrived. They were big time. And they were going to be a force going forward in the world of popular music.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm so sad I've finished all 3 of them! They were AMAZING! Enjoy! I look forward to reading them AGAIN! Trust me, I will!
0345803507|5.0|Forget all the hype...this is a great love story. You want true love to prevail. Like all couples they fight over money and jealousy, but at the end of the day, they are lost without the other.
B004FHBO9K|5.0|One of my favorite movies, awesome soundtrack, love the clear vinyl, 2 disc set.  If you can get it, get it !
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|The case came in a little different than I thought but it was nicely done. I enjoyed watching Evangelion and I watched the series back in the day online but I still have yet to get the complete series from ADV films.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I had been told about this series, so I was looking forward to reading it.  I enjoyed every minute (except the last, when I realised that there were 2 more books to come)  I  can't wait for them to arrive, to finish the story.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I love these movies. Can't wait for 3.33 to come out. I've seen the trailers and the story seems to continue with more fighting and new characters.
1451620829|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he couldn't put it down.  He absolutely loved it.  He loaned it to my brother he too couldn't put it down!
B0068MNNOE|5.0|This is for the die hard fan or the guy that flunked out of English Lit!!  Great original story great visuals this is Sakespears England and ITs loaded with laughs, tears, drama plot twists action. Anonymous is probably one of the best acted movies of the last decade  With hero's and Villan's you wont want to forget! I believe this film should have won best picture for the year it was released no if's and's or but's.  This movie was a lot of fun and I would recommend it to any one!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the book!  It was a page turner and keep my interest.  I want to see the movie and compare it to the book.
0741470314|5.0|Brilliant biography, sounds very positive and the concepts of this are outstanding. She did an awesome job of Portraying Michael and really made you feel like you were actually living in Mr.Jackson shoes
B004LROUNG|5.0|I loved this John Grisham book!  Mr. Grisham has written another page turner. I hope this story is turned into a movie.
B001S86J1C|5.0|A gift for my father-in-law. This is a classic  movie that he still had on VHS. Buying it on blu-ray was a great gift idea. Its a classic movie that he can watch on his Hi-def System.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I actually feel this is at least a four star movie. Especially if you compared it to many of today's other movies or entrtainment options. I wouldn't normally say this, but, I can't think of a better way to say it simply. This is a feel good movie. Clint is as good as he's ever been and Amy Adams seemed to be a natural for her roll. Timberlake, not a fan, putting that aside I think he was a good choice for this part.<br /><br />It's a good movie! You won't be disappointed.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a great app for my kindle fire hd. Its easy access to ebay and makes the search process go that much quicker without having to get to the ebay site prior to searching. I just click the app then search.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Love her books and will continue to buy anything she writes.<br />Thanks for the adventure, mystery, history and love story.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My kids love this app. Its a great distraction for them when we are stuck in a waiting room for an extended period of time and they seem to be getting restless. I don't normally let them play with my phone or Kindle but it has provided a nice last minute fix to getting stuck in places like the doctors office etc for an extended period of time.
1595141715|5.0|this was a fantastic book, so honest. a book that will tug in your heart strings, and parts that even made me cry, hard to believe its fiction. i am really hopeing jay asher wil wright more like this.
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|Wish I had bought just several songs individually...not as good as her first CD<br />Donny Osmond is on several selections..he is really good.
B00008CLIP|1.0|I bought this item with the vol 1 and my surprise is that the second vol was not in it. However I had to pay for the total of the two items.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An amazingly told story. I have never been so attached to a book in my life. To say I couldn't put it down is cheesy, but indeed the case in this instance.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This movie is great for adults and children. I was very happy to receive the digital copy with this DVD because my kids enjoy watching it on my phone and iPad when we are out.
B003K16P50|4.0|Very entertaining. The ending seemed a bit contrived, however it kept my interest quite well.  I would definitely recommend this book fir anyone looking for a lite but interesting novel.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This movie gets my kids attention like no other! It is great for adults and children and sends a very good message.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Munro is one of the best story tellers in the English language.  This collection reveals love in all its splendor and pain. Her characters are so believable.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|In every single section it would let me get so far and then the game would freeze and quit to the main menu. It would reload to the same place, but any progress I had made on a puzzle I was trying to solve would be lost and I would have to start over. The graphics were neat and the general idea of the game was interesting, but the constant freezing was maddening and most definitely had a negative impact on any enjoyment I might have had!
0792839129|5.0|Great movie.Watched often. Will be watching again and again. Happy I can still get VHS tapes. Many DD people and older people are unable to use the DVD machines for a number of reasons and there is a need for the VHS tapes.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|By now everyone knows how popular this film has been. I would add that it is one of the modern films of its kind that I found very well done and with main characters who all gave strong performances. A very enjoyable, exciting movie, which I have watched more than 3-4 times!
6300274187|5.0|Love this movie. The story line is great. The music ic wonderful....who doesn't know a song from this movie? This should be in every video library and shown to generations to come.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I loved this book, it kept me entertained and engrossed the whole way.  Amy Chua is hilarious in the things she does, her descriptive detail is wonderful.  Maybe because I'm Chinese and related to her in so many ways that I was so captivated by her book, but I think all Asians would love reading it because you can relate to it in some way.  Overall, I would definitely recommend it!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|this is quite easy to use.  Verbal warnings can be set up to warn you if the battery level is getting too low
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book. Kept having to find out what happened after every chapter.  You will be glad  you purchased this book
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all of the books by Lee Child, and I haven't been disappointed with any of them.<br />It is a fast reed, and always keeps your interest.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It Is A Great. Does All It Says It Claims To Very Well. Get It And YouLL Be PleaSee. EnjoY
B004Y042N8|1.0|Program is design OK but nothing special it seems more like a failbook advertisement than a game. Even free was a price too high to pay, developer please growup, no one  over 10 has a failbook account
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Great flick, I don't know how much more you can say about it. It is a classic and I recommend it to anyone who I think would like is. It is a more gory, better executed, better written version of the hunger games in my opinion.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie shows what love really is and how big the human heart can expand if we will just let it and give others a chance. It's just so heartwarming.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I liked the movie and think over all it is well done. I personally like the old version better. That being said this is a welcomed addition to our DVD library.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Book was ok, but was not what I expected. Characters where not as well set up as in most of Clancy's books and I did not like the ending.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Can't put the game down it  keeps me going. Really fun. My daughter and I love playing these types of games
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book takes off where the second stopped. A bit too lengthy descriptions sometimes, especially in the time before the final fight. Also perhaps a bit easy writing when describing the really mental fight between the three at the end.<br />Definitely worth reading!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have many games on my kindle and this is my favourite by far. Great game with great missions. No complaints at all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book really continues the page turner feeling of the first book. The book builds in more complex plots but carries it well. The second round of games is not as breathtaking exciting as the first but fun to read. Builds up a lot for the last book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful storyline! Want more for sure, can't wait for catching fire! Matinee is a lovely lead character can't wait to see where her story goes
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this book some years back. I liked the book then and I loved the book this time. It made me cry both times I read this book. Now I want to read more of her books.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|GREAT BOOK DANGIT<br />IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GET IT NOW THE THIRD WHEEL IS THE BEST GET IT NOW
B0058SNI9O|5.0|Excelente producto! Grande, comodo y muy espacioso. y Muy buen precio.<br />Lo recomiendo. Muchas felicidades por ser un buen vendedor.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Clear characterisation, strong story line, couldn't put it down until I finished it! Another Harry Bosch  case, beginning during the riots in L A in the 90's and resuming 20 years later as a cold case- well worth a read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|was never intersted, until i started going through this awesome pages. lots of good tips, ideas, interests, remedies, it great
1856697525|4.0|I have been aware of the late Saul Bass's immense talents as a film title designer for many years. From memory Carmen Jones was the first movie to bring him up to my awareness level. What I didn't know was that he was a graphic designer, had created many logos that even I knew, belonging to American and multinational companies. He also designed things for the home. This is a well researched, glossy, beautiful book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an exceptional love story!  I enjoyed how it's suspenseful, romantic and touches on the appreciation of the human spirit and death.  Highly recommended this book!
B0039TD7PY|4.0|This couple of renown hooked up again for a three-night gig at the Troubadour in LA where it all started those many years ago. Both a great trip down memory lane and a great introduction for the next generation into the compositions and performing talents of two musical Hall of Famers. There is a CD and a DVD in the one package.
B007EE564U|4.0|As ever it's pretty well put together. Not my favorite of the series but by no means an inferior book, it just didn't hold me as well as some of the earlier ones.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great story. It is both erotic and romantic. A very easy read. Definitely a step up from 50 shades...<br />It is a fast read.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This was a great product and is a classic to have on hand for the holidays!<br />Great product!<br />Thank you!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great story. It is both erotic and romantic. A very easy read. Definitely a step up from 50 shades...<br />It is a fast read.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Enjoyed the book though not my  usual type of book to choose.  The whole back in time thing and imaginary friends and world kept me interested.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This informatitive book sheds light on the problem of wheat , gluten and celiac disease.  Contains easy to use strategies.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|It is fantastic. It helps you see and feel what was happening. I gave this as a gift and my friend loves it too.
B000L212HC|4.0|The Prestige was a very good movie. In the end, I really felt bad for both characters. The picture Blu-ray picture quality and the sound was excellent.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|with an amazing twist =] read for an eye opener. I really had a new appreciation for paranormal (for lack of a better word) fiction
B002QGSYRC|5.0|I knew almost nothing about the Korean War.  Halberstam's well-researched and very detailed accounts provided me the kind of detail to give me a good understanding of what went on during that conflict.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in U.S. history or reading accounts of war.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|My last CD is stuck in my broken car CD player. I missed this so had to buy again. Thanks
B0063IH60K|5.0|Is have played both versions. The Kindle Fire version is easier to use. Double click plays all cards, not just those going to Aces. Fun, mindless stress relief.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Rick Riordan dose a excellent job in writing the first book of Percy Jackson. He really pulls you in and makes you feel like you are not just with Percy, you ARE Percy. I was completely engaged throughout the whole book. I couldn't put my kindle down! I can't wait to see the movie and read the next book!<br />I definitely recommend this book to any one who is looking for something new to read. Trust me, this book will keep you hooked and by the time you finish all your friends will be tired of you talking about it!
B00003CWL6|1.0|Hopefully, I can exchange and get one that does play.  It is a great movie but this one I can't watch.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The hype was correct, in my opinion.  This was one of the best, if not THE best superhero movie I've seen in the last 20 years.  Nearly non-stop action, and great scene stealing by The Hulk.
1416955070|4.0|I had heard rave reviews about this series for ages, so when the first book, City of Bones, came up as a $.99 e-book special I picked it up with little thought as to when or if I would actually read it.  As is the case with many such additions to my library when I did finally find myself in the mood and position to read this story I was surprised, and luckily for me it was a pleasant surprise.  It turned out to be a very well written book that cycled through so many different archetypes that I lost track of just which books and movies ran through my head that it \\"felt like\\" and accepted the fact that Ms. Clare had managed to weave them together to create something both new and unexpected.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading this book, and while at times it did give the larger-than-life vibe that almost reached epic fantasy level, it managed to stay just grounded enough in the urban part of urban fantasy to tell a single story.  That story took many twists and turns (including a loo-loo of a twist in the last quarter than I certainly did not see coming) and certainly did not reach its completion by the end of this first volume in the Mortal Instruments series but somehow remained both fresh and intriguing throughout.<br /><br />If you had asked me at the two-thirds mark or even the three-fourths if I intended to pick up the next book in this series I would have answered with an unequivocal \\"yes.\\"  The story was fascinating, the characters relatable and the writing just shy of the overblown mark but well into the florid that those of us enraptured with words love so dearly--and then the ending to this story took place and I find myself unsure.  Not of the writing or the story or even of the choices the author made with her characters or plot--which while they surprised me I cannot honestly say I disagree with--but more because I know that if I continue with reading this series  I will be opening myself up to more surprises.  Surprises which, in the middle of a so manifestly over-arching series story-line are rarely good and with a year to wait for a conclusion of this series to be published...well I'm not sure I want to subject myself to the immersive tension only to have to wait so long for its release.  I find myself unsure whether, without the assurance of an attainable wrap-up, this is a roller-coaster I want to strap myself into right now.<br /><br />And so as a review I can only give this...this story sucked me in so deeply that I half fear another trip down the rabbit hole, knowing I will not come out the other end quite the same was as I went in.  Make of that what you will.<br /><br />In an attempt to quantify my own uncertainty I give this book four stars for both the journey I loved and the destination I am unsure of.estly over-arching series story-line are rarely good and with a year to wait for a conclusion of this series to be published...well I'm not sure I want to subject myself to the immersive tension only to have to wait so long for its release.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|With the intensity of the beginning, definitely thought the wouldn't end  so abruptly. I did enjoy the trilogy, just needed a bit more closure.
B001JRB16U|3.0|wish it had been in blu ray.  Other than that it is a great classic for all ages and all genders.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is the best app on amazon hands down all the features its awesome its a five star in my book

0765325950|1.0|I have mixed feelings about giving 1 star because I love WOT and have been looking forward to this book for a long time. But it seems like this is the best way to make our opinion known about the wait for the ebook version.<br /><br />Like ebooks or not, they are here. Like Harriet's decision or not, she made it. The marketplace should tell her if she's made the right decision or not. As a consumer I'm waiting till April to buy the ebook and giving this 1-star rating on Amazon. Hopefully I will find a pirated version to read before then. But I will still buy in April in order to both support Sanderson, Harriet and the WOT franchise (if you don't pay for art you enjoy, how will it be made?) and also to add my purchase to the number of ebook sales so that hopefully publishers will see the demand.

B003L16FAE|1.0|Purchased this movie for a very low price (under $4.00).  I have always liked this movie but the one star is for it will not playback on my PS3.  Figured it wasn't worth the time or effort to send it back because of the low price.  Guess you get what you pay for.

B005O7PXNS|5.0|If season 3 of this innovative crime drama ramped up the tension between Castle and his muse, season 4 explores Beckett's more vulnerable side, revealing a sharp detective with more insecurities than she would like. Each episode is packed with all the drama, wit, and tense moments the show is known for, along with several new and very creative formulas to alter the pace. And the finale? A cliffhanger of sorts with more...satisfaction than trepidation hanging in the balance.

B000FBFMZ2|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much.  The plot was not too simplistic.  I liked the characters.  A bit on the dark side if you don't like dark but a great read.

B00668I4KS|5.0|My wife bought me this movie on BluRay for Christmas fearing I would get it for myself. We had already seen the DVD version that she checked out from the library. I have been a birder for 40 years and my wife joined me 24 years ago. This movie has an impressive amount of accurate information in it about birding. We have noticed a couple of flaws (There are no penguins in the Aleutians). We were both thrilled, though, to see such big-name actors playing birders. It is true that people who do a \\"Big Year\\" are rare individuals as few can afford to spend so much time (and money) during any one calendar year looking for the little feathered dinosaurs. Personally, I find the geographic boundaries quite arbitrary. Birds don't respect political borders. Anyone who beats the record for doing a Big Year certainly does not qualify as the \\"best birder in the world\\" as the region does not even cover the whole Nearctic region, much less the world. I have given up keeping a North American bird list long ago and have even let my \\"world list\\" go by the wayside (I am guessing it is somewhere around 2,000). But we have seen the movie four times and plan to watch it again with some birding friends of ours. This movie deserves ten stars!<br /><br />I saw a video review by someone who represented the masses and gave this movie a poor grade. He said that the opportunity for comedy was squandered and that the talent was wasted on this film. I was offended as I believe that the dialogue and humor were very witty and amazingly suitable to the subject matter. The humor and sentiment you see in the movie are exactly the kind you expect to come from real birders. While few people will have the real life experiences represented in this film, it will give genuine insight into what really goes on in real birding experience, for that is the point of this movie; not to deliver the same kind of comedy that is in all of the mass-produced productions written with the same formula. This film should provide a refreshing and unfamiliar adventure for novices in the field of wildlife appreciation though from a competitive perspective. I think that the humor in this movie simply flew over the reviewer's head as did the birds.<br /><br />By the way, my wife and I saw our \\"lifer\\" Colima Warblers probably hiking the same trail on a stressful hot sunny day at Big Bend. We ran out of water half way through our hike and my wife managed a partially colapsed lung during our ordeal. But it was worth it. She recovered and we will never forget that day.ide a refreshing and unfamiliar adventure for novices in the field of wildlife appreciation though from a competitive perspective.

The reduced price made me buy it and I am glad I did.<br /><br />I loved this book, and I had a hard time putting it down.

B001JRB16U|2.0|There is no question about the quality of the movie.  It is an exceptonal production.  My ONLY issue is with the quality of the disc.  Why does it continually stick while running?  I know the simple answer is \\"Check your dvd player\\"  I ran other discs with no problems so I must assume it is a faulty disc.  Is there perhaps some way that it can be safely cleaned?  Incidentally, disc #2 ran with no problems.
0525953728|5.0|First off I'm the type of person who HATES reading books, I would rather cut my entire lawn with toe-nail clippers than read most books. But this book is one I figured I would try out, and once I started it I couldn't put it down, I read it in less than 5 days. The book has some pictures which was nice, because it's always interesting to see the kinds of things special operators get to see. In addition to the photos, the book had side stories that weren't just about the raid, it had more stories which made you understand the people talked about in the book. All in all this was an OUTSTANDING book! I highly recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest in Navy SEALs or special operators in general.

I Wish I had Hazel Eyes but mayBe she will do a version with \\"Behind These Blue Eyes\\". :-)  A true artist that adds THE ONLY proper thumbs up for American Idol. She would have made it with or without AI. Congrats on a great career that is just beginning. Love Ya' Miss Kelly!

B003O86FMW|4.0|I admit it: I started out as a Hunger Games skeptic. The concept seemed a little old hat to me, as I cut my teeth on dystopian lit like Stephen King/Richard Bachman's \\"The Long Walk,\\" which I feel must have inspired this series on some level. How the hell would they handle such a topic in a manner appropriate to YA? The topic itself is grim stuff, and I wondered if they soft sold the whole thing.<br /><br />Still, I think when it comes to books it's important not to judge a concept/story offhand without at least some exposure to it, as opposed to film where you can pretty much see upfront that something is crap, so I decided to give the Hunger Games a shot last year.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, and I consider the first book worthy of enshrinement in something like my personal pantheon of books (most of my five-star reviews on GoodReads are for books like this, five stars takes something really special that not even the best authors can consistently nail down). Sure, it had some issues, specifically with what I think of as \\"bare wires\\" where the mechanisms of the plot are a little exposed to a reader who knows what she or he is looking for, but I didn't feel that those in any way diminished the novel.<br /><br />So it was that I went into the sequel with  some trepidation. I'd heard it didn't capture the magic of the first book, but then again what could?<br /><br />I'm happy to report that while Catching Fire is not an all-time classic, it's still a really damn good book. It starts a little slow, but once it picks up it takes you on one hell of a roller coaster ride. The \\"bare wires\\" issue is a little more prominent in this one, to the point that I couldn't ignore it, knocking a star from my overall rating, but it's still a very worthy title and gives me hope for the third book. Introducing new characters to a series like this, where so many are designed to die, is a tricky matter. It doesn't help that the book's central conceit revolves around contests that include 24 participants. This means that Collins really runs the risk of overloading a reader with new characters when there are already so many old ones with which the reader must contend. She doesn't entirely pull this off, as I had a moment or two of confusion, but in general I think she handles it well enough that it didn't detract from the story for me.<br /><br />It's hard to go into some of my other issues without spoiling it, but I think you'll probably recognize the points where you can see plot mechanisms at work. If you can get past that and some character overload (though some of these new characters are great), I think you'd enjoy it, even if dystopian, depressing fiction isn't your thing.hat include 24 participants.

I was really suprised with the amount of metal this can remove and not wear itself out.  I cleaned up my machete in minutes and it was in a sorry state after being forgotten for a year.<br />Time will tell how long and how much use it can take in the field before it needs replacing though the price has me thinking I'll pick up a few more.  The thong hole is a nice feature to place among your keys, alternate tool ring etc.

B0012GMZMW|5.0|This album contains all the elements of Journey at their 1980s pinnacle:  soaring vocal melodies, monster musicianship, and top-notch production.  Songs like All the Way are very commercial, but so was a lot of their popular stuff.  Songs like Higher Place, All the Things, & Loved by You exude more of an AOR vibe, so there is quite a nice mix.  Augeri does a great job and does have the same range as Perry did \\"back in the day\\".  Also, if you miss hearing Neil wail a great solo, your wait is over:  Neil opens up and displays his awesome chops, phrasing, and sense of melody.  All in all, this is an album I play often!!!

B00A81NFAS|5.0|Coming off the success of his previous film, the brilliant and superbly acted \\"The Fighter\\", David O. Russell brings us a story dealing with family issues, personal struggle, and the quest for happiness. The movie revolves around Bradley Cooper's character Pat, a man who lost everything due to an incident that landed him in a mental institution. When Pat gets out, he's determined to get his life back together while seeking out the silver lining in every situation. He meets Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, who has problems of her own but agrees to help Pat reconnect with his wife.<br /><br />The film walks a difficult tightrope, blending comedy and romance with the serious issues of mental health and family struggle. Russell does a great job of accomplishing this by staying sensitive to the material and knowing when to throw in some subtle humor. In fact, you could classify this film as a romantic comedy, albeit much smarter and sensitive than is typically seen.<br /><br />Cooper continues to prove that he's more than just a pretty face, and is absolutely terrific here. There's a plethora of emotions felt by his character throughout the film and the actor is more than up to the challenge of portraying each one with sincerity. Equally impressive is Jennifer Lawrence, who's funny, sexy, intense, and mysterious, usually all at the same time. The chemistry between the two is very believable and there's some great dialogue between them throughout the movie. Another impressive performance comes from Robert DeNiro, who plays Pat's neurotic father with a Philadelphia Eagles obsession. Finally, the surprise of the film has to be Chris Tucker, who has been nearly non-existent for the past few years but gives a heartfelt and sincere performance.<br /><br />This is a terrific film and one that is more than deserving of any awards it may win. It's a good lesson on looking at things differently and seeking out our own silver linings.

B005LAII1C|4.0|Who would have thought that the combination of Mark Wahlberg and a talking teddy bear would make a winning combination? The jokes and humor in the movie is what you would expect from an R rated comedy, and is crass more often than not, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have heart; quite the opposite in fact. The movie is actually quite heartwarming and a tad emotional. Wahlberg is great as the stoner Bostonian and continues to prove he has a place in comedy. There's quite a few hilarious moments, as well as countless references to pop culture that usually accompany them. Overall this movie is what you might expect from MacFarlane, but adds a slight touch of emotion to make it that much better.

I learned a lot from the book and I have lost 15 pounds and every week I lose a little bit more.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am a  big Lee Chlld, Jack Reacher fan, but I was a bit disappointed in this book. It didnt match his usual fast paced, to the point. writing and was sunk in minutia at times. We all like to know the processes and background but  there are times when the yawns begin and it happened several times to me in this novel. Speed reading helped me over these passages. Sure, there's lots of action, much of it ridiculous, beyond reality, which can be good, but in this case is a bit insulting to the reader's sensibilities.  Also, too many characters, one could easily get confused or forget who the heck this one is, and an abrupt change to the story that just didn't work, in my opinion.<br />And then there were references that seemed like clues  (crystal objects) but weren't, seemed of no consequence to the story eventually but left a blank spot in the summing up.<br />. .  But-Jack Reacher fans will like much of the book, and perhaps try to forgive the  movie industry for choosing little Tom Cruise to portray this hugely built, 6'5&#34;  rough and tumble, craggy faced man with football sized hands.  We like him that way.

B008B8AOQI|5.0|I've been hooked on Mike Rosenberg's music after seeing him live some months ago. The album, although not as raw-sounding as his live performance, still maintains its authenticity. The lyrics nice imagery and underlying virtues that the artist has adopted are wonderfully articulated. I bought a used copy for around four dollars. The disc works perfectly, and I believe the only reason for its surprisingly low price was a scratch on the case. Would highly recommend.

B004UNX1LS|1.0|horrible video selection!!!  doesn't have half the videos youtube has!!!!  only has one green day video and that is just them getting their grammy award!!  doesn't have a single metalica or journey video!!<br /><br />overall there are barely any videos!!
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Sinister is my favorite horror movies of all time, and I love this movie, I saw it when it first came out, and I thought it was astounding! AWESOME!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love seek n find games, and this one had enough clever puzzles to keep it interesting. I thought the plot was creative though the POV character was a bit shallow. Overall, fun and creepy game. I hope they make another! Let us play as the doll this time... Maybe fighting all those demons?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The graphics are very clear on my kindle fire. Suspenseful and addictive. Couldn't put my kindle down. Good game for the price but shouldn't be advertised as free that was unfair especially when you get to play half of the game and then stops because they want you to buy it to finish the game. Other than that I loved playing this game.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|For some reason this version doesnt give you the option of choosing top stories or most recent in the notifications like it used to.  Please Fix!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was a really good movie, I cried at the end but it was extremely thought provoking and Bruce Willis, though he really took a back seat was great, good actors, good story.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|It does not match the first book - again because of the war issues but the characters are believable and held my attention.  I shall read the last of the trilogy.
1594202842|1.0|This obnoxious woman called her daughter garbage and once told her also that she loved her husband more than her. Personally I think that Amy Chua loves herself the most if she can say things like that to her daughter. I think you're a fool if you've bought this book and have enjoyed reading it. You the consumer have also given this mean woman exactly what she wants. And that is money. Chinese women like her are so incredibly typical. They seem to have this very high opinion about themselves and think that most people are below them. That's the attitude that many of them seem to have and I think that it is totally screwed up. Obviously this woman had a very hard time growing up too, but for her to write a book like this and to tell the public about what she said to her daughter is just awful. It is very possible to be a good parent so that your children can grow up with discipline and positive self esteem, but you do not have to say and do some of the things that she did in order to make that happen.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I had just read several really complicated and sad books - it was time for some fun!  I started reading this and could not put it down!  Not only is it funny and light-hearted, it also speaks to some serious relationship issues which many of us face.  The character development of Harold is just wonderful.  I loved the book, and when it is our turn to lead the book club, we pick the book for that month - that's my choice!  I'm excited to hear what the rest of our readers think about this book.<br />Enjoy!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is challenging enough to make it both interesting and entertaining.  It's really hard to put it down.  By making repeated attempts at the more difficult stages you can learn the game's strategy, overcome it, and win the round.  The music background is a nice touch.
B00013UTUM|5.0|.....okay.....this record is in two parts.....part one is a collection of 'b-sides' from their first three years.....part two is a show from Paris2001.....this is a MUSE record, it rocks.....what they did was couple the live show with the ones that got left behind.....make no mistake, this is a solid record.....this is a MUSE record, it rocks.....
B00633W614|5.0|I truly could not put this book down. The story moves right along and brilliantly comes together. Jeffrey Archer is a great writer!
B0037RBVG0|4.0|So many gems on this album. It always makes me sad to listen to this and realize Elliott is no longer with us. Production is also really swell. I mean how do you NOT get sucked in after listening to &#34;Coast to Coast&#34;? This CD is an essential purchase to any Elliott Smith fan.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All 3 of these book are in my opinion wonderful. They are beautiful love stories and have become some of my all time favorite books.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a fabulous story and gives me hope of the after life.<br /><br />I have told many people about this book and think it is great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Highly recommend this book. Suspense, passion, love and faith in the unknown all in one book. Couldn't put it down!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book read it 7x already and still can't get enough of it. Great story!! Can't wait for Travis' side in walking disaster.
1250006341|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised when I received this book!  It is a beautiful hardback book with gorgeous pictures, quality paper and something to leave on a coffee table as display.  Anyone who has enjoyed Downton Abbey will treasure this review of Season One.  It's definitely a keeper and would make a lovely gift.  I am now going to order the new, second book!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I wasn't sure how fun this game would be when I got it, but I'm so glad that I did, as it is loads of fun, &amp; challenging, too! =)
B000KFB4PK|1.0|I bought this watch for my five year old, who was so excited to receive it.  However, the back fell off as soon as he put it on.  I had taken it to a professional jeweler to get a battery and it worked fine, for a few days.  The time is not correct.  Very cute watch but very disappointing quality.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really liked the story written from the prisoner --- had many twists and was surprised with the ending.  Never expected that.
0765325950|5.0|I was introduced to the Wheel of Time series in 2003. I waited only 10 years for the conclusion (compared to those who waited 23, 10 was quick) and I must say, I'm happy with the last book. There is no obvious shift between sections written by Robert Jordan and those written by Brandon Sanderson. The ending is the right one. Now, I just have to come to terms with the void in my life - I'm not waiting for any more WoT books.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|There were things I would have liked to know more about and some things less.  Wish ending would have been and different, but just my opinion.  All three books captivating.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great game, crashed once,  but really like the game. After it crashed I lost all that I'd done up to that point, but its fun so I started over. Hope I do not have that problem again
1593082045|4.0|i bought this book (and Vol.1 also) as a Christmas gift for our great-nephew (age 12 1/2) who has become a Holmes fan.  I would have preferred an illustrated edition, but we wanted to give him the complete stories and this was the only edition that seemed to have them.  The print was readable, the book was good quality, and the price was very reasonable.<br /><br />He was thrilled!
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|Given as a Christmas gift, it was on his wish list. He has always followed Wallflowers so I knew he'd love it!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Awesome is all I can say, first of albums by this to group for me to download.  Will be looking for others
B00005JKGK|5.0|Again, I watched from my class at college and I just love it and want to have it for my best films collection.<br />It taught me a lot of life and of myself. A few statement I decide to write down here from the movie because it is so true, intensive and I don't want it happens to me anymore.<br />&#34;...I was taught to desire nothing, to swallow others people misery and to eat my own pityness...&#34;<br />&#34;...my mother did not know her worthy until to later for her but not for me...&#34;<br />&#34;...I am not going to let get away this time, making me feel bad...&#34;<br /><br />This is the kind of movie it  should be made more often.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Order this movie now if you have a good taste in cinema!! I heard about Carney's film (Once) from the now-famous play recreation. This film is the epitome of low-budget, d.i.y. masterpieces. It delivers a non-typical story that contains an wonderful journey to an unlikely ending, unlike 90% of the utterly hackneyed movies produced in the mainstream culture of the film industry. To sum it all up, purchase a copy of this DVD or rent the movie if you want to experience a refreshingly exciting filmic adventure.
0857680986|5.0|Andrew Loomis has a great heart and spirit when it comes to art and life. He offered some really valuable advices in the book. Those advices are priceless, not to mention you get a great drawing book that comes with those advices! I would buy more of his drawing books from this publisher.
1593082037|4.0|I bought this book (along with Vol.2) as a Christmas gift for our great-nephew, who at age 12 1/2 has become a Holmes fan (as we are!).  I was hoping for an illustrated edition but this was the only one that seemed to have the complete stories, and it is very readable and good-quality.  He loved it.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|Very enjoyable tale. Was only planning to watch half one night and the other half the next, but couldn't turn it off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. it is awesome! I could play it all day long. It is very addictive. try it and see what u think.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Great insight into how our society is changing in the workplace and what motivates us. This book is a must read for any manager or officer when trying to motivate their teams.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Plain and simple: purchase a copy of this DVD to add to your Walking Dead collection if you are a fan, and to catch up/review before the second half of season 3 airs on February 10th. Walk on. :)
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Discovered that in my old age I can no longer read paper books. My eyes can't handle the strain. The ebook was perfect. was able to make the text just the right size.
0765325950|5.0|Been reading this series since 99, and while there were many lows (Book 5, 6, 7, etc).  The pace picked up as the series progressed and after Jordan passed away, I must say, Brandon Sanderson wrote an amazing ending to this epic series.  A Memory of Light was breathtaking, I couldn't have imagined a more satisfying and yet heart wrenching ending.  It is perfect!
B0007939NO|5.0|I love this movie!  This dvd is in excellant condition and very well done.<br />A remarkable way to treat a dear old classic.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Very much enjoyed this series, Jane Seymour is good and the guy that plays the part of Sully in excellent.  If you can believe what you see there is quite a bit of USA history in the series, especially concerning the Native American Indians, and the black people who made it out west.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|I used to be a huge Tom Clancy fan but it seems each successive book runs out of credibility and story line in fewer and fewer pages. Threat Vector reads like it was written by a committee. The story line twists and turns like Alice in the rabbit hole and is not as believable. I wonder if Clancy gets paid by the word. That would explain all the superflous scenes and techie stuff. If you can't figure out the ending well in advance, an unlikely event, read to the end and be a disappointed  former Clancy fan. Like me. Now.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|This was such a good story that taught me alot about chimpanzees i did not know. You will be crying by the end. GREAT
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is a wonderful story of who Santa was/is and how he became Santa.  This movie was a quick favorite and now is a classic in my home. Love it!
B002J2RDA2|5.0|tarantino makes the bitchinest movies i love the old school editing and the music he uses and the hot chicks
0740748475|4.0|A wonderful gift for my husband. Super quality!<br />We were surprised, however, at the unyielding weight of each book.<br />The size and weight make them difficult to manuver while lying down.
B000002GYR|5.0|One of Tom Waits first US releases, this CD contains many songs that have since become classics. Many have been \\"covered\\" by other very popular bands over the last 20-30 years with great success. A must have for any true Tom Waits fan.
B004Y042N8|4.0|I jumped at the chance to download this app when I saw it was free today. I can honestly say that I'm not disappointed at all. It's very challenging and a great way to pass time. I don't know why a lot of people are bashing it!? Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Gotta read all of them! First book wowed me and it just kept coming the best part was being able to get them through Kindle in 30 seconds!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is the best app for file sharing. I love love love love love love love love it. Like a lot.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read several books by Nicholas Sparks and this one is the best!  It kept me interested the entire book and I had a hard time putting it down.  Stayed up late several nights.<br /><br />The characters were all interesting, but the lead female character, Katie, was superb.  She suffered physical abuse from her husband and in spite of this, was a very strong woman.  Love was evident by the compassionate people who helped her along the way.<br /><br />Excellent read!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a great time filler when you have a few minutes to waste. my kids love it though! cant complain too much since it was free.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Was purchased as a gift for a big Van Morrison fan. She loves it. It is a highly ecletic collect covering the span of his music.
075669812X|5.0|A mi niño y a sus amigos les encantó pues es de calidad y es lo que ahora les gusta a ellos!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put it down after reading the others! Smutty yes ,but there is a lot more to it! All about control and comprimise.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Ordered as a gift for my Granddaughter. I ordered several movies and they were all great and she loved them all. Price was excellent on all of them and had a speedy delivery. This particular movie wasn't due to arrive till after Christmas but, was pleasantly surprised when it arrived two or three days before. Very pleased! Would recommend Amazon to everyone.
B009ZG6YPU|5.0|This is a very interesting idea, it gave me food for thought and the book is well written. I read this in just a few days which is fast going for me. I highly recommend this book.
1439153663|1.0|This book was selected for our book club and it was mediocre at best.  While the writing was acceptable, the story was only mildly interesting.  Our club agreed that the examination of the main issue - the treatment of slaves in early America - was germane, the story was not compelling.
B003JBI4F0|5.0|This book is exactly what you would expect. Well done and entertaining introduction to VBA. If you are looking to learn, this is a great place to start.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Retribution was up there in greatness with the first of the series! Loved that Rain returned! The end left me wanting to see the next in the lineup ASAP!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great sequel! The first book was great, but this was a wonderful follow-up. I can't wait to read the final book in the trilogy.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Ordered as a gift for my Granddaughter. I ordered several movies and they were all great and she loved them all. Price was excellent on all of them and had a speedy delivery. Very pleased! Would recommend Amazon to everyone.
B004WR125O|3.0|Have had some connectivity issues. Also sometimes it seems the system needs to be &#34;reset&#34; by unplugging, powering down, et cetera, before the WIFI interface works properly.
B002JODV3S|5.0|Steve Vai does some phenominal guitar playing & stylizing in this concert. The other musicians are also a brilliant collaboration (especially the girl on violin). It's kind of like a rock band (featuring a great lead guitar) with some touches of classial music movements. I also got a kick out of all the gadgetry Steve has in front of him on the floor of the stage.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so hooked on this show I can hardly wait for the next episode. I love the storyline, the characters and the history.
0553801473|3.0|I am a fan of the series, but this book didn't further the story much at all.  Do you ever get the feeling that you are being taken for a ride? And not in a fun, we're going somewhere kinda way.  The story doesn't advance very far in this novel.  I can only hope the next moves us closer to the climax.  This book is a must read for fans of the series, but it is a far cry from the previous books.
B003Y7AR7C|5.0|This is hands down the best version of the Nutcracker I have ever seen. Miyako is perhaps the most flawless ballet dancer I have ever watched. I would recommend this Nutcracker above and beyond any other version.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Not much can be said about a classic. But this is the first book I picked for my new Kindle Fire and it was very easy to find.
B006MFISQK|5.0|To watch Downton Abbey is to watch a way of life slowly die with an epic story and it kind of reminds me of Gone with the Wind.  The best part of the TV show is the personal look into the servants' and nobilities' lives from the early 1900s and how they interacted with each other.  You really feel transported to the time period and all the characters are interesting and likable yet flawed.  Like any loyal fan would, I bought this book because it had the words \\"Downton Abbey\\" on it.  I figured I would love it.  I did and I got more than I expected.<br /><br />This was more than a behind-the-scenes look at the actors and the locations.  Jessica Fellowes takes history and facts from a time period that is kind of overlooked and just makes that time period come alive.  You get to go on a journey to see how essentially Jane Austen's time became the world we live in now. She made me care about where the term \\"weekend\\" came from and why the Dowager Countess was so baffled by it.<br /><br />Here are a few of the fascinating morsels that I learned:<br /><br />*The whole family will come down for breakfast except the lady because married women get breakfast in bed daily. (Breakfast in bed for Mother's Day anyone?! Now I feel ripped off because it was just something they got EVERY DAY.  I'm seriously doubting that our modern world is \\"better.\\")<br />*You get to see the beginning of things that have survived to modern times like cornflakes from America.<br />*Country Houses were being torn down left and right after WWI until The Victoria and Albert Museum had an exhibition called \\"The Destruction of the English Country House\\" that saved them.  (That sounds like the most boring exhibit ever but now I'm depressed that I missed it.)<br />*Cora's back story is from a trend during that time of American women coming to England and marrying English lords.  Cora was based on woman in real life named Lady Curzon from the book \\"To Marry and English Lord.\\" (Okay, I have to admit that I did not notice Cora was American until I read this book.)<br /><br />I adored reading all the history and the real life inspriations for the show.  The pictures are beautiful.  The actors give insight into their characters.  You get to read about everything from clothing, family, and society to war and change.  It's a look into an era that is really the beginning of our modern world and the death of a way of life that had been around for a very long time. This book was the perfect companion to my favorite show.not notice Cora was American until I read this book.)<br /><br />I adored reading all the history and the real life inspriations for the show.

B004P98QZ8|5.0|Many parts, but was put together quickly and STAYS together!!  My Ninjago fan is crazy about this set above the others he has!
B003G4W49C|4.0|the story was great, well told. but it was written for a younger reader, i hope the movie does the story justice.
B000YDG5X4|5.0|This is a great boot.  Extremely comfortable from the first moment I put it on.  No break-in required.  This boot does run VERY large.  I usually wear a size 11 (the other pair of Timberlands I own are 10.5), but with these I had to get a 9.5.  Thanks to Amazon's easy returns it wasn't a problem to try several sizes and now I have a pair of boots that I love.

B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Love to hear her sing, there is so much heart and soul that she puts into each<br />composition. It makes my heart sing just listening.
B004LROUW2|5.0|One of the best books I´ve ever read. Murakami has amazing writing skills and an imagination beyond all frontiers. It´s a modern tale that flirts a lot with fantasy in a way that doesn´t seem far-fetched from our reality. Although the rhytm slows down a bit on the third book, it was definitely a pleasure to read it from beginning to end.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|the book was a fast read and was well written, felt a little rushed. but the action was fun to read!
B005SZNZAY|5.0|I loved this album.  It really showcases Chris Cornell as a vocalist and songwriter.  I was fortunate enough to see Mr. Cornell in concert the week this album came out and the recordings on this CD are a wonderful representation of the live show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books! Great to see how the relationship evolves from the 1st book to the end of the 3rd.  Addicting to read and easy to attach to the characters! I'm bummed I'm done with the series, what to read next? Hmmmm
B006LSZECO|5.0|Enjoyed till the very last page and would re-read again.Will probably pick up Flynn's other book too and hoping they are as good.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|God found a good man and gave him the opportunity to become a great man.<br />Sgt York was willing to listen to God to fulfill his future as a great soldier and citizen<br />in the army with his duties carried out in great faith and fashion.

B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Not what i thought it would be. Movie is slow, no climatic parts. Characters develope ok, I am real glad I did not go see in the theater. It is more of wait till it is on TV movie.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Solid rock album.  Not Soundgarden's best work (unfair I know given the long history and great work done in the past), but I enjoyed it.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Maybe my expectations were so high because I love her on 30 Rock and SNL, so I was expecting to laugh my way through the book.  There are some funny parts of the book, but I was not rolling over laughing.  There are only a couple of funny sections in the book.  I do like her autobiographical format and can hear her saying the words in the book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Leaving a review in exchange for gaming bonus ... wish you all would wait awhile before harressing your paying clients for &quot;a like&quot; and or a review ... too pushy ..but the game is a good game as long as one is patient.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|Great music by A7X, songs not released on a wide scale like most of the their CD's. If you like A7X, you need to get this CD.
B0058VW36U|5.0|What a cool fun smart little game this one is! my sons love it - it requires planning, problem solving and process-wisdom and IS fun to play.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I like animation movies. Definatly an entertaining movie. Has some funny moments and you dont get bored watching. Two more word reqired.
1594487154|5.0|Do you already know the work of Daniel Pink?  If you do, then this latest book will help add to your appreciation of this thought leader and the ways in which he re-frames old ideas and presents new ideas for the reader's consideration and implementation.  Pink will make you think!  Sales!<br /><br />In \\"To Sell Is Human - The Surprising Truth about Moving Others,\\" Pink posits the idea that we are now all in the business of selling - products, ideas, ourselves, obedience.  As he has done so beautifully in his prior works, Pink collects data and anecdotes and weaves them together into a narrative that is both enjoyable and instructive.  He gives many examples of how the days of the door-to-door Fuller Brush salesman and the used car parking lot huckster have transmogrified into a era in which we all need to move beyond traditional stereotypes of sales.<br /><br />The book is neatly divided into three section:<br /><br />Rebirth of a Salesman<br /><br />How to Be<br /><br />What to Do<br /><br />In each chapter, after sharing concepts and examples of those concepts being put into action, he summarizes the contents of the chapter in a pithy way - employing the concept in his own writing and \\"selling,\\" and then wrapping up with a sample case.  Here is a wonderful example from his chapter on how to \\"pitch\\" an idea.  He has been discussing a community's need to raise funds to rebuild a decaying bridge that links towns on both sides of a river.<br /><br />\\"Your Twitter pitch could include an online link to an artist's rendering of the bridge along with a list of its benefits and entice people to click it with: See what tomorrow's Beeston and Arborville can look like & why we need to create that future.<br /><br />If you're sending information to your fellow Beeston citizens, your subject line pitch could be: 3 reasons why Beeston families support a new bridge.<br /><br />Your rhyming pitch?  Opportunities are wide on the other side.<br /><br />Your question pitch could help people think through their own experiences: Should it be such a pain to get to Arborville?<br /><br />And your one word pitch could explain the reason for your efforts (not to mention an indispensable lesson of this chapter): Connect<br /><br />(Page 174)<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book includes Pink's telling about shadowing entrepreneurial figures - San Francisco's last surviving Fuller Brush salesman, and Shamus Jones, Founder of Brooklyn Brine, an artisanal pickle company.  I was so intrigued by the story of Brooklyn Brine that I put down the book and Googled Brooklyn Brine and spent some time enjoying the videos that tell the story of this start-up success.  I guess Pink knows how to move a reader!<br /><br />I cannot resist a good pun - or a bad one, for that matter - so I will close with one.  In a world in which we all need to know how to sell ourselves, you need to read this book, or you will be in a pickle!<br /><br />Enjoy!p people think through their own experiences: Should it be such a pain to get to Arborville?<br /><br />And your one word pitch could explain the reason for your efforts (not to mention an indispensable lesson of this chapter): Connect<br /><br />(Page 174)<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book includes Pink's telling about shadowing entrepreneurial figures - San Francisco's last surviving Fuller Brush salesman, and Shamus Jones, Founder of Brooklyn Brine, an artisanal pickle company.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|If I were a rich man, I would buy many copies of this book and always have a dozen or so wherever I went. I would pass them out to whoever I believed would actually read and - therefore ultimately benefit from this wonderful book.<br /><br />There were many times when I felt compelled to set the book down because the emotion was just excruciating. But two minutes later, I would return.<br /><br />Super easy read and can be easily finished in a couple of commitments. I am not naive enough to believe this book will have the same impact on non dog lovers as it does on those of us who cherish our furry companions. Already knowing how a dog DEFINES unconditional love, only enhances the message of the story.
B002V091IO|5.0|kept me interested all the way through have recommended to my sister and friends. Felt like I was actually in her shoes at time

B009TZ7WDK|5.0|One waits a lifetime to witness a moment of true greatness. These two, veritable babies still, are destined for greatness. G_d has blessed them both with this rare gift and they have in turn blessed us with the sound of their voices. To hear Jonathan alone, without Charlotte, would be like watching Swan Lake with only half the orchestra or eating a piece of chocolate torte without the raspberry coulis. These two cannot and must not be separated. Their voices together constitue a true miracle. This album has moved me greatly and I am privileged to have been able to hear them sing these impossibly beautiful songs. Ave Maria, my favorite song in the world.<br />S.V.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A friend recommended.  She was right... I plan to read the next book.  Good to be back reading between the pages.
B009VB97EY|4.0|If you're watching this movie for its dynamic plot (and chances are, you're not), you'll probably be disappointed. The storyline and acting is so-so at best, and it feels pretty thrown together. However, if you want to see this movie for the more obvious reasons (Channing Tatum plus a slew of other hot male dancers...need I even elaborate?) disappointment is not in the forecast. Their performances were great, and there were some pretty funny moments too. Magic Mike isn't a masterpiece by any means, but I enjoyed it and will watch it again. It's a great girls night movie, and worth buying if you're looking for something lighthearted and full of eye candy!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|If you liked Hulk, Thor, Captain Amarica, and Iron Man you will like this movie. Fun movie kept me entertained.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Though the plots may be comfortingly formulaic, Julianna Margulies' performance elevates them. It's great to see such a talented actress in yet another outstanding series.
B001F12J0C|5.0|.the old MGM type. Of the action type, Matt Damon Bourne films are first class.They actually have a story line as well.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We liked this one so much we ordered gift copies sent to two family members.  Delivery was very quick. We will get the third season as soon as it is out.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|... Simple, honest and wise.  Refreshing view of human nature.  I need  to write 10 more words so here we go.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I had company for the last 5 days and every evening was Castle night. They want copies of their own
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Just finished the game. My first RPG on my kindle fire hd 8.9. Have to say it was good. I was surprised. Decent characters, good controls, and characters abilities and stats are customizable. (which I love) Story was a wee bit straight forward for me, but that is the charm of old school rpgs. Overall I had fun with it and found myself playing it constantly.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I so love this movie. It is cute and fun and my kids laughed at those little yellow minions too.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This particular Making is . challenging. The first time I played, I used layout number one on Red Dragon and it took me 26 minutes to clear all tiles. When I went to the next layout,,it took 14 minutes. So I'm learning.
B0091PLKSQ|3.0|The price of the item was not worth it.<br />There was no sticker as advertised and<br />the poster was ok.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son was so excited to get this for Christmas, as he knew this had been sold out and figured he would not get it.  This made his holiday!
B002NHGG92|5.0|What a great story.  Much different from other  Vamp stories. Shocking and haunting , however great connections between characters.  Enjoy the twists in the stories you never no what can happen.  Damon is a wonderful crazy vamp who I can't get enough of.  Elena is sweet and so interesting. Poor Stefan is just so sad and heartbreaking to watch ! Can't wait to start season 2
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Would recommend this book to everyone.  I enjoy subjects such as these written by scientists. Dr. Alexander shared his experience in a beautifully revealing manner.
B000085RPU|5.0|It was very funny and fun to watch. I my kids and grandchildren really liked it too. They want to watch it over and over again.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is a great case for the Kindle Fire that was a very reasonable price. Looks good & does what it is supposed to.
B0041KX0R0|5.0|This Region 2 DVD will not work on US systems.<br /><br />.<br />BABEL tells four interconnected stories in four languages. The link for all is a Winchester rifle that once belonged to a Japanese businessman. Perhaps the most compelling of these situations involves that man's teen daughter, a chronically depressed deaf mute who's obsessed with a police detective.<br /><br />Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu gives us enough information along the way to hold our interest, revealing facts when necessary or timely. For instance, we don't learn of the rifle's origin and its chain of owners until well after an unintended injury occurs.<br /><br />There's troubling events in all of this film's locations: Morocco, Japan, Mexico, and to a lesser extent, California. A mostly unknown cast give naturalistic performances, some of which will haunt you long after the credits start to roll.<br /><br />Highest recommendation for a brilliant motion picture.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Very fun app not too easy. Definitely addicting. some of the levels are very difficult. i love how the little faces change when you win or definitely are going to lose.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What I like about this book was that it followed five families throught all the changes in the cultures of different countries and social class of the time.  It also keep a good pace without constantly repeating the story line to fill pages.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Bought this cooler to replace the stock one Intel provided, which are horrible by the way.  They work well and for half the price of other big name coolers you get almost he same performance.  I've overclocked my cpu i7 920 from stock 2.66ghz to 3.2ghz and getting temps of 40°C.<br />P.S. It comes with only one fan so you'll have to buy the second one if you want to run two fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book and loved the book even more than I thought I would. Suzanne Collins spins a tale of adventure, emotions, and thrill that holds your attention and I found it hard to put it down.
B002VPE1X4|4.0|I bought this for my husband's camera, so he wouldn't just carry it in his pocket. This little case offers great protection, has soft padding, and is not too big. It has room for an extra memory card, but not extra batteries.
B0051T46XM|5.0|Filmed in the style of Blair Witch Project with some very well done CG. If you can get past the English subtitles and Norwegian dialogue, this is a very entertaining movie. Some gore, suspense, and graphic creature violence. I mean they are trolls for goodness sakes. Honest to goodness bone grinding trolls, who can smell the blood of a Christian-man. If I recall correctly one goat, one man, two bears and at least two trolls meet their demise. I wouldn't show this to young children. Reserve this for Jr High and older. My boys 12 & 15 really enjoyed this even though they were put off by the subtitles at first. SPOILER: At the very end of the movie there is some very well edited real news video of the Prime Minister of Norway (the movie fails to ID him though) explaining that the high tension power lines in northern Norway are necessary for troll control.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Package arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  Excellent and well received as a Christmas gift.  Was pleased with the results.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|I downloaded this app for my 7 year old who loves anything from playmobil. I have to admit that I enjoy this game myself. Very addicting!
B001ECQ4DA|2.0|Big Bang Theory, wonderful and funny. Quality of the blu ray however, terrible! I opened it up and put the first disc on, first of all, it was covered in smudges. I wiped clean, and it skipped through out 3 of the episodes. Total bummer. Just such a PAIN to return :(
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|THIS IS A GOOD DVD; HOWEVER, I WAS TRYING TO GET A COPY OF THE FINALE OF CELINE DION'S SHOW IN LAS VEGAS WHICH WAS FANTASTIC AND I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS AVAILABLE.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|its ok its a off off rumple run though but good though. you can be a girl or a boy with your chose so it good.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It's almost as good as the first and second one. It's fun and action packed. Great movie to own or rent.
B0086700CM|5.0|a game for the whole family. my oldest and I spend hours with this game. A must try for the whole family. Great graphics no bugs.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It will make a great movie.  Very unique and descriptive.  Characters come to life.  Magic comes alive and I enjoyed reading it.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Another great CD from the incomparable Whitney Houston.  Wish she was still around to give us more - greatly missed.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|This has been the most stable processor I have used to date.<br />I can't say the stock cooler does more than a fair job, but in a pinch it will cool a stock clocked machine fine.<br />I have used it in several AsRock  and Gigabyte builds.<br />It has no fear when it comes to overclocking, with Asrock 970 Extreme4, it runs at 4.41, easily on H50, water.<br />I'm not sure why, but Gigabyte does a bit more stably, with good cooling.<br />If you let the board do the overclocking, use good memory to get the most from this 4100 FX.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I think that Brooks takes a risk writing from the point of view he chose for this book. Seems off considering the usual first-person suspense that one expects for zombie stories
B009GEAPYW|3.0|Animated. New twist to the Batman story. It reflects on Commisioner Gordan and Bruce Waynes beginning. Developing into their relationship as crime fighting.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I use it most every day. It's easy to use and gets better all the time. I hope you keep adding features like speed limits etc.
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|i love rihanna sexy beautiful n love her music but this cd im not feeling it at all i only like maybe 3 songs but my fave is obviousely diamonds i feel diamonds is very different from her other songs in this album n should not be here but glad she released it cause i love that song
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to pass the time away. Just wish the was no ads between every game. You should have fun.
B00846REIS|4.0|Is good reading was not crazy about the way they resolve their problems with sex.<br />Prefer a more definate ending.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|My husband and I got into a movie watching phase last week, and of all the movies we watched we only liked two and this was one of them.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Too absurd, too violent for my liking.  Glad I didn't pay more than two bucks for Kindle version.  I won't be reading anymore books from this author.
B001BWQVSG|5.0|All Martha's work is a joy to listen to. All her disks sing of her passion. I wish I could have met her!!
B0059XTU22|5.0|Peter Jackson and his crew in New Zealand spare no expense when it comes to creating entertaining, and most importantly creating a world for the audience to be immersed in.  The attention to detail is top notch and the storytelling is extremely engaging.<br />This film is beautifully paced, with sufficient room for character development and setups for the plot of the next two films. And the balance of fast paced action with emotionally captivating character moments is very well handled. As always with Weta Workshop, the costumes, props and set designs are unprecedented, allowing for a more 'realistic' and believable fantastical experience.  Howard Shore's score is nothing short of a masterpiece, and blends beautifully with his work on The Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />The characters are very engaging, and Martin Freeman's Bilbo will be remembered for generations.  I could not have been happier to see Ian McKellan return with his perfect portrayal of Gandalf the Grey, as well as several other characters from the original trilogy.  The 13 dwarves were perfectly cast and uniquely designed, and several of them were very effective in bringing the lighter tone of the book through to the screen via their slightly whimsical personalities.<br />The first film in The Hobbit trilogy is sure to become a classic, and fits perfectly into the Middle-earth that Peter Jackson gave us a decade ago.  I very much look forward to the next two films.
B003A2JBLE|5.0|I bought this for my 8-year-old son, a huge Lego and Star Wars fan who'd been asking for [Boba Fett something or other].  This was a hard-to-find kit and a bit pricier than I'd have liked, but it has a lot of pieces, we enjoyed building it, and it's sturdy enough that he can play with it and not have it &#34;shed&#34;.
B005HSL626|5.0|Friut Ninjas is cool. I love arcade mode by best score is 463.I think the little ones will love it because all u have to do is touch or slice the fruit and it amaze there little minds
B000RZGFYS|4.0|Couldn't beat the price on this cd.  $5.00!  Bf enjoyed getting this but didn't get it in time for christmas.  That's okay cause the price was worth it.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Loved this story!  A great mix of time periods, romance, mystery,  humor (I laughed out loud at one part!) and best of all... a ghost!  Only sad to see it end!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Adele has an awesome voice, this whole album is just wonderful. You will want to Play it over and over again
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is just marvelous! Beyond the stuffy English attitudes, posh and spoilt lives of the Abbey's inhabitants and petty servant politics, there is so much that the show offers - geo-political ongoings of that era, stunning architecture, societal constructs, culture to name a few.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It's surprisingly unique. Not the formulaic typical cookie cutter crime shows we're too pummeled with on TV but these characters are quirky, and are clearly drifting towards each other slowly. That said, this is clever and fun. Enjoy every episode!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie and I have recommended it to several of my friends.  The acting was good and the plot was well written and the scenery was awesome.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down wanting to continue on the journey with the author page after page.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|I use Hotmail as back of email. This app was easy to install and easy to find and view emails. I give it 4 stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this weather app on my Kindle fire. It gives you the forecast and radar quickly. I'VE tried other apps but this is the best.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun aaaa.&aacute;&ntilde;sj skskskdn xjd md jxjd sjsjs jsn sns jsnsn sjs jjsjs sjsjsn sees Sss Sss Sss Sss Essex Sss Sss Sss
B000LN7HUC|5.0|I love this stove,The fuel is cheap its compact and its not to heavy.I have used it for a few weeks now hiking the florida trail and it has worked without a problem.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I chose this rating because the display is too small, on many of the game patterns.  They could have easily filled the screen space better to make it more readable.  Even with readers on, one pattern in particular was very difficult to play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't wait until this was free on Amazon Prime.  I missed it on broadcast TV and needed to keep up. If you havent watched this, I recommend you start at the beginning.  This is the only show I make it a point to watch.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Hard to put this book down.  An adventurous journey taking in the lives of Eliza and Rose and the challenges both face thru out their lives.  The title was what brought me to check out this book and I am so glad I did.  Not finished yet and look forward to where this tale will take me.  A bit confusing as it flips back and forth in time but once I got into the flow it has been a great read.  Will read more from Kate Morton, certainly!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is like my best game on here. and for people who don't like it you suck. so don't have a device if you don't like it. it's your loss any way but this game rock.
B005LAII08|4.0|I will watch this movie again and again - great story, great graphics....reminds of the Disney movies of old. Just the right amount of comedy, action, etc...
B0042816YK|5.0|The movie is great!!  I had seen it and wanted to own it for myself.  The DVD is in brand new quality
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Started a little slow, but once I figured out what was going on, it became a really good story and drew me in. Looking forward to next installment if there is one.
B001UQ5T5O|4.0|I bought the DVD for around $7.00 without really realizing was for sale on Amazon in England.<br /> When it arrived it wouldn't play on my regular DVD player so I did some research and found that, even though the US and England are friends, DVDs from England only play on machines that are set to zone 2.<br />So I changed my computer to zone 2 in order to watch the movie. Afterward I changed my computer DVD player back to zone 1. A few days later I changed to zone 2 again to watch the movie but when I tried to change my computer back I realized that it had locked itself in zone 2 on the firmware.<br />Seems that you're only allowed to change the setting four times and THE INITIAL SETTING COUNTS AS NUMBER 1.<br />So, now I have to have a new DVD player installed in my computer (150.00+) to play my movies that are zone 1.<br /> READ EVERYTHING VERY CAREFULLY WHEN ORDERING A DVD SO THAT THIS DOESN&#34;T HAPPEN TO YOU!<br />Thanks
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Not as slow to start as the first in the series, I enjoyed it even more than the first one.
030758836X|4.0|I don't want to give away the good stuff. This is a book you will not regret buying. I would have preferred a different ending; nevertheless, it is a great read!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Amazing! I love it! If I didnt have other stuff do to, I would watch it over and over again.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Google search board is too hard to load on my kindle. Once it is loaded, Symantics keeps insisting on you buy them. Even deleting them, they keep interfering with the kindle. Couldn't even swipe pass them at times, they just kept coming back to their product.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I could not download this app. Because I have an android tablet, sorry to say not a Kindle. Mine is a 10 inch,Ilike the larger screen.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Loved the movie. Love Clint Eastwood!<br />Got to stop and start the movie a couple of times! Love being able to have movies for 48 hours!
B00005QGAV|5.0|This has been an important part of my music collection ever since I stole the cassette tape from my sister after seeing Michael Jackson perform magic at the Superbowl `93 Halftime Show. I don't even know what teams played that year, but Michael's set changed my life. It's what made me want to start writing. Dangerous in particular has some of my favorite work he's done. It's go some of his grittiest, and some of his most epic. I don't love every track on it, but I don't really hate any either. Of all of his great albums, I think this one is his most solid and interesting work.<br /><br />[...]
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Gave to my daughter who is a Potter Head for a Christmas Gift.  She had taken all of my mothers movies so she could watch them whenever she wanted so I just bought her her own set.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Highly recommended classic Christmas tale. It is our family tradition to watch &#34;It's a Wonder Life&#34; each Christmas.<br /> I was leery that this colorized version would have distracting and odd colors, but the coloring is so excellent that when watching, I quickly forgot that this was not the original version. (The original version is included as a separate disk so you can have your cake and eat it too.)  As a bonus, there is an interesting special feature about making the movie and its early poor showing at the box office.
B00933JL0A|4.0|Easy to learn.  Great time waster if you have to sit around waiting to pick up the kids or whatever.  Also doesn't require an active connection to play, unlike some other games, which is a plus because I can't always be connected.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I was a little put off at first because it was not a full season, but they did an amazing job with what there was. I worked most nights this season was on so im very happy for it to be available on dvd.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app I like to sleep to some of the sounds there is a timer so I don't have to keep it going all night
B000002MY3|5.0|When I first got this CD back in fifth grade, I didn't understand why the word \\"down\\" was bleeped out on the radio version of \\"You Oughta Know.\\" At some point my innocence was shattered, or enlightened depending on how you look at it. Jagged Little Pill has managed to keep a steady rotation in my life for a good fifteen years. It deals with a lot of the reoccurring themes of my life: pressure to succeed based on standards that other people set for me, trying to find happiness in this mess that life sometimes becomes, and the unrelenting presence of catholic guilt and it's appetite for anxiety. \\"Hand in My Pocket\\" has become my go-to song on days where I feel like I'm losing my grip. \\"Because what it all comes down to, is that no one's really got it figured out just yet...\\"<br /><br />[...]
B0002I831S|5.0|The disks have all played perfect.  The shipment came in good time. I am completely satisfied with the purchase.  Thanks.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It has so many levels to play around on and dozens and dozens of challenge missions and you can level up your profile so it affects all towers in future games.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is an excellent game, even better than the PC version since it has features that I have YET to uncover on the PC version at the same point that I'm at in the Kindle version. I'm STILL puzzled by that......
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|best album yet. if you haven't heard them before this as album is amazing<br />. Im so happy I bought it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Couldn't stop reading finished all 3 books in 2 weeks!!! I recommend this book to any one
0425252868|5.0|Apparently I was not the only person who, once receiving the book at my doorstep, could not put the book down!  Everyone before me in their reviews have said what I felt.  One thing I may add: particularly interesting were the details of the daily life for a German fighter pilot, especially so, the most interesting revelation of their complete love of flying and doing their job, as most dramatically told in regards to flying the new jet that came too late in the war to save Hitler's regime.  Utterly fascinating book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very beautiful life story,had sad parts and happy parts. Loved the ending. Would reccommend it to anyone as great reading.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Great heart wrenching story about young love that connect two hearts completely. Sad and tragic but full of truth of the justice system and life. Well done Jodi!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I enjoy reading the novels by Nicholas Sparks. The ending was what I had hoped it would turn out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is really funny and I would give it a 5 star rating and my step dad knows Jeff Kinney also my step dad went to collage with him
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|I really liked this movie. Yes it was a bit corny in places but that is what made it more appealing. And it was suitable for my grandson to watch. Because I liked this one I bought it's &#34;sequel&#34; Journey 2 with Dwayne Johnson. I would not recommend that movie at all.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The subject matter was not exactly new as I have a graduate degree in psychology.  However, like so many psychological issues it is always helpful to hear from an intelligent person who lives with the issue, in this case introversion and Susan Cain covers the subject with understanding and grace.<br /><br />Recommended reading for everyone who deals with an introverted family member or friend.  Being introverted myself I can find myself on almost every page.
055380684X|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend for Christmas. He read it in less than a week and has been talking about it ever since. It is an inspiring book that I would recommend to anyone.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Moulin Rougue is definitely one of my top 5 favorite movies. The soundtrack is amazing, the actors all amazing, the storyline amazing...I love everything about it. Very few movies can I watch repeatedly without getting bored but this is one of them.
B008SVFX96|3.0|Quite influenced byt the blues, but it was always going to be.<br /><br />It lacks the raw rock feel of Richie's previous two albums but is a new direction for a legend and he does not let us down!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie was great. Good message and uniquely connected to the period of the story. In the end, I felt like I was entertained, not preached at, but I came away with a valuable message just the same. It was nicely arranged aesthetically as well.
B004AKCME8|3.0|I bought this for my grandson who likes animal movies but this movie was much more violent that I expected. It had a good story line and great graphics. But definitely for teens and up.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Have not seen all of the Harry Potter movies as yet, but am sure I will be enjoying all the rest of them as soon as I get a change.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is really fun for everyone if you are looking for a game like this this is the one to get. I have played a lot of games like this one but this one beats them all
B005VPRET4|5.0|My six year old granddaughter loved putting this together. It was a bit tough for her to do, but with help she did it and loves playing with it.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|No matter how many times I've seen this movie, I continue to enjoy it.  We are fans of these guys.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I have read this book about 5 times I love it, I love sitting down and reading when its cold out.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have this game on my iPod touch...and I absolutely love it. It's fun for everyone. I mean, everyone has this desire to wipe out humanity a little. This is great for people who like a strategy games and even better for those who COD Blacks Ops 2 or games similar to that. This is money well spent. Would recommend it to everyone!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|An excellent movie, and a tearjerker. We think we're just a bystander in something horrible, say and do nothing, and finally find we will be punished for our misdeeds.  We must speak for our helpless brother.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is truly a great read.  This omnibus is the first work I've read from this author, but I'm now running off to buy everything this guy has written.<br /><br />I have  never done a review before, but I just want people to know how highly I recommend this set of books. It's such a good story, especially if you heart dystopian fiction as much as I do...  the characters are deep, the plot is forever thickening, the world is easily visualized in your imagination and the lines between good and bad are nicely hazy.<br /><br />Hope this helped you decide to PURCHASE THIS.  Do it now before this dude starts charging what his writing is worth...
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My grand-kids and I love watching this timeless DVD. I like the 3 Disc Combo. Great sound and picture for this movie.
B000002KOO|4.0|A great album.  The CD conversion/remix isn't as good of quality as the original vinyl.  I think this is the US version so it's missing Albatross, but My Dream is very close to being better.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|When we found Castle on Tv and watched we fell in love with the show .. so I bought the first two seasons on DVD and can't wait to get the other 3 seasons and watch it ... and get caught up can't wait for the new season to come out ...
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My son loves this game. It keeps him entertained especially on long trips. To see him enjoy a kids game is great.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its always good to ha ve solitaire around.  You can resort to it for a quick game before bed or anything else!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Took long of cook times hard to keep customers happy when u have no food to serve because it takes hours to cook , at work most of the day don't have time to keep up
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is the first time reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I shall read more by this author and her sisters.
B005LAIIA8|3.0|I thought the movie was just okay. Admittedly I am not the hugest fan of Tim Burton, although I love Nightmare Before Halloween.<br /><br />My kids didn't like that the movie was all in black and white it was a tad bit on the scary side although not too bad. It was not a horrible movie, it was not the greatest movie Disney has put out. There is nothing specific that was bad or good it just didn't click with us. We own it because we love Disney but not sure it will get watched very often.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|We don't watch much TV but were Hooked on Castle ... so when I seen it was out on DVD I bought it for us to watch will get the other 3 seasons soon...
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a great game. I first downloaded it to my phone and now to the notebook. Very addicting gave. My son loves it and so do I.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|She is definitely different.  I have found that you either love her, or you hate her.  I happen to love her.  She is doing her own thing and not trying to sound like anyone else.  I find it quite refreshing in a time when almost every new song on the radio sounds exactly the same.
B0014VQGX4|1.0|If it looks like a good deal, then it's probably not very high quality. This was no exception. Lesson learned.
B000002OR4|1.0|In the first place, I ordered this so quickly, I didn't realize it was the soundtrack from the movie (I wanted to order the movie.).  But.........since it was, the music was very depressing, as it should be, considering the movie is depressing as well.  No wonder it was just 10 cents plus shipping.  I learned my lesson - - &#34;take your time in ordering and consider all details&#34;.  Service was great - - I received the CD in a matter of a few days.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|This book is amazing. it is so hard to find an interesting book that has more meaning behind the words, and more purpose then just telling a story. the way it is written keeps the reader guessing, questioning, and feeling excited the  whole time, Not the typical book where you can figure out the whole storyline from 100 pages in. If you want a book with substance and a good story , read it.
0596809158|4.0|This book is meant to be a reference. It doesn't teach you, and it is not meant to, anything about regression statistics. It does, however, cover using R for statistics (including regression).<br /><br />I think much of the information contained in this book is widely available free on the internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Comprehensive reference on R.<br />2)Good explanations and writing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)Mostly for beginner-intermediate users. Not too many expert level concepts.<br />2)Most of the information is available for free on the internet, and usually in much more comprehensive form.<br /><br />If you already have a good R reference, then this book will probably be redundant.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very good read .Started off slow but once I got into the book, I couldn't put it down. This is a must read...
B000000OU0|5.0|The live action wasn't cumbersome and was VERY tolerable.( The audience applauding...)<br /><br />The cd recording was great and Eagles band speach was better!
0425252868|5.0|I have read many books on WWII and I must rank this one amoung the top 10.  It's a great story about history, war and the greatness in mankind.  Couldn't put it down.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|As far as demonic possession films go, THE POSSESSION isn't too bad.  It gives us the usual ingredients:  an angelic looking sweet natured daughter; the estranged parents; a creepy atmosphere and the evil released demonic force.  There are some chilling scenes, especially the moth invasion.  The main drawback is the film's predictability---it's all been done before albeit the Jewish exorcism is a new slant.<br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a solid presence as the devoted father but Kyra Sedgwick isn't given a whole lot to work with as the mother.  Natalie Chalis and Madison Davenport do well as the teen daughters.<br />THE POSSESSION doesn't set any new standards but for fans of the possession genre, its worth a rental.
B002BPRZU0|4.0|In my opion this album is pretty good. I prefer more of a grove and jamming that what this album does. Don't get me wrong, Joe is a great guitarist but this album does not make it into the top 10 of my blues album choices, however it comes close.

0762439009|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend as it is one of his favorite movies. Very satisfied with the product, he loved it! I found it completely amusing and spot on that they included the toe!  I loved that this kit contained the most memorable things from the movie.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We love &#34;who done it's&#34; and this is a great one. If you like the Mentalist or if you liked Monk, you'll love Elementary.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is by far one a new favorite. I enjoy cooking and was intrigued by this movie. I love how the story goes between Julia Childs and Julie the blogger. I have often thought it would be fun to have a cooking blog so I really enjoyed how this played out. I guess I could relate to Julie and her struggles to get the recipes right. If you like Julia Childs or just like cooking in general you will enjoy this movie!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun I like it I like to see how many games you can unlock I had it on my phone but so much easier on the kindle
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Item arrived in due time and is of excellent quality. Had just seen the movie and wanted the highlights without the whole score, which .I think tedious, except to those deliriously devoted the musical.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This is a good story!  I think the copy needs some editing, but the characters are well-developed and the story is compelling.  I'd like to read the next story in the series.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this show is awsome. I haven't seen anything this good in a very long time since the fourth kind. i love it the actors are awsome thats why i gave it 5 stars!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am really enjoying this Bible app. Not only does it give you different translations but you have options for daily readings and daily devotionals. Plus you can set up a daily Bible reading plan. This tool has been very helpful to me and my daily Bible reading. I would definately recommend this app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing book. I could never put it down. The suepense lead me to each thing that happened in the book. The ending surprised me, I thought omething was going to happen.
B00826B65M|5.0|One of the better aspects of e-books are collections such as this one. One gets the highs and lows of an author and can survey the range of his genius.
B009POCFTG|1.0|Don't waste your time and money on this one.  I can't believe Matthew McConaughey agreed to be in this movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This reminds me of playing the real game at the fair. Just realized you can sell the prizes for more tokens!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This should be required reading fir every 5th grader. It does Dr job of speaking from every point if view and everyone can see a part if themselves in one of the characters. It teaches a ton of great lessons without being preachy. It is a fast and easy read, but very absorbing. I am going to see if my son's reading group teacher will have the group read this.
B00979CS50|5.0|The feel of these songs just wraps around you and makes you feel comfortable. Most are like a smoother version of Like a Hurricane - long guitar jams that stay interesting rather than getting tired. It is an amazing collection.
0307405095|5.0|Bought this for a roommate for Christmas. It's a beautiful well written book , beautiful photos, and tremendous variety.  Easy to follow.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK. I hope they keep the beauty in the movies to come. You'll enjoy every page.

B007T2XC7A|5.0|Love this album!  As with all Nora Jones this one is just as great!  Very relaxing and soothing voice! Just great!
1451620829|4.0|Classic story of a Rock N' Roll star straight out of a VH1 special.  The writing itself isn't spectacular, but the story is engaging.  I know many have criticized the book as Peter C just whining, but it his story and a great story of his rise and fall and re-birth.  Complete with debauchery, sex, drugs and the love of music.  Any KISS fan would truly enjoy this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After watching season one I had to continue.  Watched this season in 2 days.  Can't wait for season three to be released.
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|This was one of those impulse buys, it is funny but make sure you watch it before you buy. Rent worthy.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read this because I had heard many good things on Kindleboards.com about it, but figured it would be like many of the overhyped books I've read.  But no, it was great.  Juliette is a hero I want to read more about.  Mr. Hillary's writing is impeccable and  a truly original setting for the story.  I will be reading more by Mr. Howey!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game! Hard to put down after playing it for the first time.  Highly recommend it for the Original Kindle Fire.
0451232852|3.0|Fall of Giants had the potential to be as fantastic as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, but way too much of the story was spent on WWI. I was surprised when I saw how long ago I ordered this book and just finished it, because it was a long, slow, boring slog and I kept putting it down. Would have been better for me if the history had included more story from the point of view of the characters we cared about. Those parts of the book sang and were a joy to read. Well written, but I thought I was buying a fictional story, not a history book.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's fun, but I don't like the shuffles. I like Mahjong because it helps you focus. Need more puzzles too.
B004VD3YIM|4.0|Fairly simple to set up. I use it with a Foscam and a Vstar Ip cam. Both are wireless cameras and as long as they are connected to your router they will work.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|This is a nice story after you pass the first fundraiser of the book. Now time to check the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the arcade game. it is addictive I played this for hours. lots of fun for anyone regardless of age
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I was really excited to play this as it had great graphics and was pretty intriguing. But after getting pretty far into the game I got hit with the same paywall everyone else is talking about. Not cool. Don't call it free if it's not. Trying to decide if I want to pay for the rest of the game but I'm thinking not.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|worth the money.  good story and graphics.<br />Not happy about the pay inside the game when you start for free.  The game is good enough not to need that marketing ploy. :
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The book &#34;Room: A Novel&#34; downloaded quickly and completely onto my Kindle.  The price was reasonable and the service was excellent.
0765325950|5.0|it truly was worth the wait for this book, the look on the receipents face was as insurmanoputna as can be.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a terrific book. I could imagine the characters as friends or at least people I know and enjoy hanging out with. The story is fun and unique. A great discussion about old vs new and does it have to be vs? Shouldn't it just be old AND new? As a reader I have to admit anything with book or bookstore in the title tends to make me take a closer look. Was not dissapointed and have already recommended it to several people.
1476704163|4.0|I'm a huge Ke$ha fan and I waited for this book to come out months in advance. Overall, it's a nice, quick read, and offers a deeper look into the life of Kesha Sebert. It's more of a photo album with some text and personal musings, starting from her growing up to the writing and making of her sophomore album &#34;Warrior&#34;. She talks about her family and her friends on the road, her experiences while touring, and working with various producers and managers. It's a little hard to tell how authentic the memoir is (did she really get into Ivy League schools?) but overall the message is loud and clear--Ke$ha is not afraid to be herself, and despite having people who think she's dumb or stupid, she is out to rule the world (or at least the airwaves).
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|I......liked this film. It was quite predictable, and I guess that could be a plus or a minus. There were some funny spins on the storyline along the way. And for me, the weird landscapes, people, and style of the artwork is what made it good for me. I just kinda wish the plot was more original.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The Angry Birds Game downloaded easily and at a very reasonable price.  I would order through this source again in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the app is so awesome it has every thing. by this app if you don't it will be terrible FOR YOU
B000SL1Q2C|2.0|I guess when you order online and it comes from Italy, one should not assume the language is in English. Very disapointed.  This was a christmas present for my daughter.  Maybe my  next purchase for her will be an Italian/English dictionary.
B000W967KQ|5.0|Wow what a book if that didn't open your eyes nothing would  the only way to go is big in everything you do l d like to thank Donald and Bill for such an amazing book  and thanks to kindle for such a good job on the new kindle hd I read on what a wonderful product  thanks a million  Claudis
034580404X|5.0|I bought this trilogy as a lightening deal and only paid $4.99, I already owned and had read the first in the series.  It's nice to have the complete story together and I enjoyed reading them.

B0038W0OIK|4.0|The product is as advertised,but the driver kernel has stopped my sleep mode from functioning. working on the problem now.
0060873175|4.0|As a big fan of Michael Crichton's work, I was very saddened by his death a few years ago.  Thus, when this book initially came out I had my doubts as to how much of it was actually written by him.  There is enough biological information in here to take up most of a college semester and the action is fast-paced once the main part of the plot gets going.  If you've ever watched a movie directed by Ray Harryhausen, this book will probably give you a few flashbacks.<br /><br />Fast-paced, entertaining, informative and suspenseful--definitely worth a read.
0618001905|4.0|King Leopold II of Belgium (1835-1909) lusted to join the European powers in the late-19th century landgrab for colonies.  After a number of false starts, he found his colony in the Congo and arranged for it as his personal property, rather than as a colony of Belgium.<br /><br />The Congo was a source of the two wonder materials of the time, first ivory, then rubber.  With a cover of philanthropic purposes, Leopold's mercenary surrogates wrung the territory out for these resources.  The methods they used were horrific: forced labor, torture, taking hostages, mutilation, and murder.  There is no sure way of telling how many people were killed during the period 1885-1906; Hochschild estimates 10 million, half the population.<br /><br />The drive to expose what was being done in the Congo was the first great human rights campaign.  There are heroes in the book, notably Edmund D. Morel, a shipping clerk, and British diplomat Roger Casement.  Morel's shipping firm had the contract to move goods to the Congo and back to Belgium.  The ivory and rubber came from Africa, but instead of trade goods, what was shipped to the Congo was munitions.  In 1897 or 1898, Morel realized something was wrong and devoted himself to fixing it.<br /><br />Roger Casement was sent to the Congo to investigate the reported abuses in 1903.  He sought out his own transportation (a way the Belgians controlled what people saw) and spent months in the rubber producing areas.  What he saw angered him.  He wrote extensive reports to the British Foreign Office, then teamed up with Morel.<br /><br />The public relations campaign they organized was a model, with pamphlets, recruitment of the powerful, and public speaking tours.  It was also narrowly focused on the problems in the Congo, rather than the general problems with European colonization.  Eventually they were able to pressure King Leopold to give custody of the Congo to the Belgian government.<br /><br />Hochschild makes a case that Leopold wasa villain, evil.  I wasn't completely convinced.  Did his actions cause enormous suffering?  Yes.  Did he intend to cause the suffering?  It was more that he was indifferent to it.  His aim was to acquire power and money.  He ran a masterful campaign to get the European powers and the United States to allow him to take over the Congo, masking his intentions with humanitarian commissions and the aim of stopping \\"Arab slave traders,\\" the boogie man of the time.  He recruited and used celebrities, particularly Henry Stanley (of \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\\" fame), who comes off badly in the book.  He was a master of spin control.  In his most masterful stroke, a commission he set up that he expected to paper over the problems wrote a scathing report instead.  His stoke was to release a synopsis of the report several days before the report, in English, that downplayed the problems.  Reporters swooped down on the synopsis and by the time the real report was released, it was old news and the newspapers had moved on.<br /><br />Leopold's treatment of the natives of the Congo was little different from the treatment they received from European colonists elsewhere.  A second way to look at Leopold is that he was a modern executive, focused on profit to the exclusion of all other considerations.  How is that different than WalMart underpaying their workers or Bhopal gas spill at Union Carbide's Indian plant that killed 2-8,000, injured perhaps a half a million?  It would take a villain speech to make him a James Bond villain.  He didn't push his mercenaries to mutilate and kill the Congolese, and his employees only set quotas for rubber and ivory.  For that, one would have to go to the Stanford Prison Experiment for how the mercenaries were able to treat the natives so badly.  I'm not arguing that he was blameless, only that others are equally culpable.<br /><br />A well-written history.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is fun to play. The game gives you another option, if you prefer to skip the hidden object scenes. I preferred to play the card game. I had to skip a few of the puzzles, and am glad the game let me do so. Since almost all of these types of games charge you to buy the game after previewing it, I was not surprised.  I appreciate having the opportunity to try out games before spending money.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|VERY VERY GOOD BOOK I RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE READ SOME OF THE DIARY OF A WIMPY KID BOOKS
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|If they would give more maps, and better network this game would be perfect!! I love this game. And have gotten so many friends to play. Put down Vita and 360 for last month.
0399160450|5.0|Ever since Tom Clancy moved his storyline from Jack Ryan, Sr. to Jack Ryan, Jr. and The Campus, his books have turned away from lots of military hardware and more towards cloak and dagger activities.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but there definitely has been a shift in the narrative.<br /><br />Once again, John Clark, Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, Jack Ryan, Jr., Dominic Caruso and the other members of The Campus get involved in a crisis which has global implications.  I would say this is predominantly a spy v. spy novel, so don't let the aircraft silhouette on the cover fool you.  The action comes quickly and continues right on until the end...although the ending seemed a little abrupt.  Personally, I think a few of the storylines could have been stretched out for a few more pages, but that's just me nitpicking.  Once I started reading this one, I found it very hard to put down--hope you feel the same way.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|great movie
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it, thinking it was cute how it danced and sang. The Gremlins was one of his favorite movies when he was younger and he still keeps it on his dresser
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was written extremely well; I could feel everything the characters felt and I cried when they cried, laughed when they laughed, and even sang when they sang! It was a very beautiful ending that makes the reader anxious to read the next! Maggie Stiefvater did an amazing job and I can't wait to read  the second book!
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|Bought this item for my sister as a Christmas gift, and she cried happy tears.  We both was very pleased with this item, the  dancing Gizmo pluch doll looks exactly the way it is advertised on Amazon.
0988262592|5.0|You've probably heard of Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford before. They are the three amigos responsible for [[ASIN:0975568612 The Visible Ops Handbook]], which can be found in the book pile of every good IT operator. Their new book, The Phoenix Project, follows the format of Eliyahu Goldratt's classic, [[ASIN:0884271951 The Goal]], and I was lucky enough to be given an advance copy to review.    Told from the perspective of newly-minted VP of IT Operations Bill Palmer, it describes the turnaround of failing auto parts company Parts Unlimited. This is to be achieved through the delivery of the eponymous Phoenix Project, a classic \\"too big to fail\\" software project designed to build a system which will revive the fortunes of the company. To quote (p51):    \\"The plot is simple: First, you take an urgent date-driven project, where the shipment date cannot be delayed because of external commitments made to Wall Street or customers. Then you add a bunch of developers who use up all the time in the schedule, leaving no time for testing or operations deployment. And because no one is willing to slip the deployment date, everyone after Development has to take outrageous and unacceptable shortcuts to hit the date.    \\"The results are never pretty. Usually, the software product is so unstable and unusable that even the people who were screaming for it end up saying that it's not worth shipping. And it's always IT Operations who still has to stay up all night, rebooting servers hourly to compensate for crappy code, doing whatever heroics are required to hide from the rest of the world just how bad things really are.\\"    Part One of the book describes in loving detail the enormous clusterf*** pie that is baked from these ingredients. The pie is spiced with an internal Sarbanes-Oxley audit which reveals 952 control deficiencies, an outage of the payroll processing system, and various other problems that conspire to deepen the woe of the operations group, all of which areclearly drawn from the deep well of the authors' real-life experiences.    Apart from the main characters - our hero Bill, his boss Steve, and the evil villain Sarah - The Phoenix Project features a delightful rogues' gallery which anyone working in an enterprise will recognize:    * Brent Geller, the boy wonder whose encyclopedic knowledge of the company's Byzantine IT systems ensures that everybody turns to him to get their work done.  * Patty McKee, the Director of Support who runs a change management process so bureaucratic that everybody bypasses it.  * John Pesche, the black binder wielding Chief Information Security Officer whose cack-handed attempts to improve security ensure that nobody can actually get anything done.    Part 2 details how the IT group is reborn from the ashes of the Phoenix Project into a high-performing organization that is a strategic partner to the business. This is achieved through the application of a heavy dose of lean thinking (including [...] ) administered by Erik, a mercurial IT and manufacturing guru Steve is courting to join the board. The book does an excellent job of showing - as well as telling - how to apply the concepts (and the effect of doing so) in an enterprise with plenty of technical debt. Perhaps the most eyebrow-raising part of this section is the way in which John has his soul mercilessly crushed to the point where he goes on a multi-day drinking spree before he is rehabilitated towards the end of the book (he is a phoenix too).    John's narrative arc is just one example of how the book also succeeds as a novel. It's gripping, with moments of drama and high emotion, as well as some great one-liners. There was even one point when I teared up (bear in mind that I also cried during Forrest Gump - unlike the book's central characters, I did not serve in the armed forces).    Nobody who has read The Goal will miss The Phoenix Project's similarity in terms of style and plot. Perhaps my favourite thing about the book'spedagogical style is the way Erik (like Jonah in The Goal) uses the Socratic Method to give Bill the tools to solve his problems by himself. Of course this learning process is fictional, but it means you get to see Bill struggling with the questions and trying things out.    It remains to be seen whether readers of the book will be able to apply these techniques as successfully as Bill without a real Erik to guide them. But of course, this is a limitation of any book. If I had one criticism it's that unlike real life, there aren't many experiments in the book that end up making things worse, and it's this process of failing fast, learning from your failures, and coming up with new experiments that is instrumental to a real learning culture.    Overall, The Phoenix Project is a fantastic read. It's entertaining, cathartic, inspirational and informative. If, like me, you have an enormous backlog of books (and more work in process than you'd like) I suggest giving yourself a break and putting this one to the top of your list. It'll only take you a couple of days, and despite its conceptual density it will leave you feeling refreshed and energized with a bunch of new ideas to try out. The Phoenix Project deserves to be read by everyone who works in - or with - IT.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Every word of this book came to life as I read it. Breathtaking....wanting more of the love that lives in darkness.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This dude is a major talent. His voice is very good, his playing is superb ... he's one of the best guitarists on the planet. The album features several of his compositions ... and they are great.  The covered songs on this album are varied and interesting.  Smokin' Joe already is a star -- but he seems to be getting better all the time. He's a an all-round performer whose skill makes a lot of other musicians with pretty big careers seem mediocre in comparison.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this series, it took me a long time to find the last book, but it sure was a great read. If you like series of faeries and other world creatures, you will enjoy reading this book.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Currently enjoying the 6th Season of Dexter.  This was purchased as a used DVD set and it is playing perfectly.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|Boyfriend absolutely loves this, we are both Gabriel fans so this was perfect.  Great gift for any Gabriel fan out there.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|Exelent mix of classic Bond Music.<br />And a enyoing musical Expriance.<br />ther is notting more to the from tis end
B0058BI896|4.0|Consistently good script-writing makes each episode  in this season worth viewing; some episodes are even brilliant. Overall, this season is a bit more consistent than Season 3, which has its most moments of brilliance but from time to time suffers from mediocre writing.<br /><br />Even then, the characters are awesome and will compel you to keep watching. Before you know it, you're done. Really great show!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This item is a gift and has not been played yet.  But I am sure it will be enjoyed over and over !
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Either the software is screwed up or the file I downloaded was.  I had a hard time getting it to display the beginning of the book (Les Miserables.) and when I want to page forward, it will frequently go a page (or more) backward.  The instruction manual I downloaded gave no hint how to approach this problem.  I have no way of knowing whether this is a characteristic of the device or if I got a faulty unit.<br /><br />When it arrived, the display was stuck on Portuguese, and I had to contact customer help to get it shifted to English.  I suspect a Portuguese-speaking previous owner returned it because it was faulty.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great Book<br />John Grisham book<br />Read it i<br />One of his best books ever<br />A real who done it<br />Times flies by,read on a airplane

0783229526|5.0|This movie is great if you're into movies about drug use/exploration, which I am. It's one of my favorite topics. Also very funny.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I like Cd and I'm glad I purchased at an affordable price. There were no scratches or damage very good quality for the price! Thanks!
0062082353|5.0|Kyle tells us what it is really like to be on the front line in battle.  His story is NOT the Hollywood version.  As a sniper Kyle struggles with the reality of protecting the ground troops while complying with rediculous restrictions placed on him by military lawyers.
0064400018|5.0|I have read, and re-read, this book from about the age of four or five. I read my entire box set to literal pieces - the only surviving copy I have from my original set is Farmer Boy (bleh). My mother read excerpts to me and my brother when I was younger than that. It's a wonderful read about a little girl and her family, in a world from &#34;long ago,&#34; but for any technological or cultural changes that may have happened since then, we still see the dynamic of a family.<br /><br />I know that some individuals have expressed concern about certain concepts (such as discipline methods or gender roles) that are now considered relatively unacceptable or archaic, and thus these folks have given the book a poor review. I would put forth that since these incidents are few and far between in the book, parents might actually use them as a *talking point* with their child! If you don't agree with spankings - discuss it! If it isn't fair that Laura can't play like a boy - have a dialogue with your child about why!  No child is &#34;too young to understand&#34; these topics if their parent presents it in an age-appropriate manner.  My mother would probably have gutted and thrown in a river anyone who laid a hand on us kids (even as a spank), but when it came up in the book, it was such a non-issue that I'd forgotten it until a recent re-reading! Mom likely expressed her relief that it was no longer okay to spank misbehaving kids, I expressed my little kid joy about not having to ever be spanked, maybe she had me say what I thought would have been a better way to handle it, and we moved on to more interesting parts of the book.<br /><br />Honestly, this is a classic. Read it first, if you're unsure about sharing it - but I'd say that to any parent about any book. I don't think this is an objectionable title at all.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|great service and price -  would order again --- --- --- --- --- -- --- -- -- -  --- --
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|Another great sports movie! I never get tired of watching this movie. Plus it is based on a true story which is a big bonus.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|This book reads with as much suspense as the award winning movie Argo. ken Follett has written a nonfiction story with the with the feel of a best selling novel. .
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We quite enjoyed Brave. The art was gorgeous! Although perhaps it wasn't as &#34;deep&#34; or manipulative-of-the-audience's-emotions as most Pixar films of late, as a Disney Princess movie it was absolutely fantastic! I haven't liked any of the &#34;Disney Princess&#34;es since Belle, not enough that I'd want any of my nieces around them. Merida is a spunky young lady, as strong-headedly independent and moody as any teenage girl. She runs away, finds a witch, hijinks ensue, and we have a fun story about finding the value in one's family that they've forgotten. It's got a moral to it without being preachy, which I really quite enjoyed. Mom was flawed, but it was a flaw of love, and there wasn't even really any &#34;bad guy&#34; in my opinion. It was about personal growth, and one's journey.<br /><br />I really quite enjoyed it. It wasn't a deep intellectual film; it's just a story about a young lass coming of age. But it was a satisfying story, well-told, with nice art and music. Planning on purchasing a copy. Do see it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its really fun to play coin dower. I got it by the draw something app because it recommended it to me.I got the app and now cant stop playing it but not in a bad way.very fun app.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie for the young and old. Acting is not bad, but the story line is something we ALL need to apply to our lives!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I recieved the product before expected very close to Christmas which I expect was not an easy task. It was in perfect condition and everything went smoothly. :)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed this time travel story with lots of history. Good book from King. Very long but kept me going.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have used this app for months now and I love it! I have helped others connect there wifi routers from just using this app.

B005LAII12|5.0|Hillarious movie...laughed the entire time. Do not let you kids see the cover or they will want to watch it due to seeing the teddy bear on the cover. However please do not let them watch this. It is a great movie but for ADULTS.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and she loved it!!! Great Christmas gift!!!! Was told I was the best mom ever. Priceless!!
B008458O3S|5.0|I like that this game has simple puzzles my kids can solve but challenging ones for me. My favorite feature is that you can clone your solutions in progress. That way you don't have to erase everything to try something new. Hours of fun!
B007N6EUHI|5.0|Very handy to bring to the doctor or PT.  Helps one understand the human body and I enjoy showing this to my clients when they mention where they are sore from either an injury or overuse.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Played it over and over again all night. All my friends are going to get a one<br />that is all
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel is something you just cannot put down until you're finished. I finished within 5 days and could not put it down for a minute. I would wake up read, go to work then come home and read until I fell asleep. The story pulls you in with the 2 point of views of the husband and wife whose disappeared. There is no detail left out on either end . There are twists around every corner and jaw dropping moments that make you say\\" oh my god\\" out loud. I definitely recommend this book but only if you have time to read it continuously because you won't want to put it down.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Very accurate. +1 second per day in my case. The crystal back lid is fantastic.<br /><br />Though I'm not so happy with the face color, it's not easy to read under dim light. But for the sales price, nothing to complain for such a wonderful mechanic automatic watch.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I hate spending alot of of money on movies.<br />Watched it on the kindle fire HD<br />Really liked the movie,it held my interest the whole movie
1451627297|5.0|The first whomp to my consciousness was the extremely well-written moments when Mr. Epping first arrives in 1958, walks past a guy with Elvis-style hair, walks into a drugstore and orders a rootbeer.  It was like, wow, things really HAVE changed a LOT since the 50's.<br /><br />--SORT OF A SPOILER --- The second consciousness thumper was when he returned to 2011 from 1963.  The terrible changes in the past and \\"the present\\" may all have been related to what he did;  or maybe to time's \\"obdurateness;\\"  whatever, although he tried to do good it didn't work ... what it made me realize was that, even tho' things may seem bad and hard now, they could have gone much much worse.  So far, we haven't had any nuclear wars, as a big \\"for instance.\\"  Things are GOOD now (relatively)!<br /><br />I wish, though, that there could have been an \\"alternative\\" return to 2011, in which the world really HAD been changed for the better by saving Kennedy!  Seems it could've been written either way.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A very nice read!  The surprises at the end are wonderful as well! I couldn't put it down and had to go immediately into Book 3!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a family with young children. The children loved it and their parents remembered it from their childhood.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Eerily closely related to the Richard Dawson & Arnold Schwarts. movie that was released about two decades ago. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it a second time. This movie is for younger audiences.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World starts off tediously slow, but picks about a third of the way through.  After that, I couldn't put it down.  Ken Follett does a great job of intertwining the characters and providing a refresher history course about the WWII years.
0525953728|5.0|The book was great. It was exactly what i expected: it came in on time was in excellent condition and was an outstanding book. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in US Special Forces or even just want to know what really happened.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Best movie ever! I like that the princess doesn't have to marry the prince to be happy. Great talking point for all those little princesses-to-be. I can't get over the fantastic animation of Merida's hair!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Went and saw this at the threater and my son loved so when it came out we had to get it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|What a read!  Having run numerous marathons and Leadville twice<br />(I only made it to the 50 mile point), my only wish is that I had the benefit of this book a lot earlier.  Anyone interested in running or endurance head trips will enjoy and learn.  For the ladies, some great role models.  And due credits for Ken C and the great tribe out of Leadville.
0870703781|5.0|Mr Eggleston's photographs brought the world of art photography kicking and screaming into the world of color. single-handedly turned the banal into the sublime. Every photographer should have this book in their library.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|My 21 yr old daughter asked for this as a Christmas gift and this was put in her stocking and really likes!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|My husband loved this movie I liked it but thought it was a little bloody. My husband really enjoyed it though.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read to the end to see who she would end up with. The whole story line was sad,depressing and more depressing. Katniss didn't even know what she wanted, or make up her mine. Peeta character was totally changed.  Nope didn't care for the story.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Led Zeppelin literally give one of their all time best, tightest, shows ever! They have never looked happier or more at ease on stage and they really blow the roof clean off the O2 Arena... Inspiring, amazing.... Thank you Led Zeppelin!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I resist the entire personal plaything preoccupation but the angry bird franchise has some draw with which others cannot compete.  There are 'wannabes' out there that have similar formats, but the bird/pig conflict continues to perplex me and nothing succeeds like curiosity.  The Space version looks to be another that'll overwhelm my inclination to a good book.  Then too, the tween is challenged to beat mom and it serves as constructive competition as well.
B005LAII80|5.0|For a film that didn't do well at the box office, there are an awful lot of people taking the time to review it here on amazon.<br />Look at all those gold stars. It's an overwhelmingly positive reaction. Makes you wonder why it didn't soar at the cinema.<br />I loved the comics as a kid, I liked the Stallone film, but this time around, it's taken to another level.<br />My only complaint would be that it's not a bigger budget, enough to explore mega city one, but that said, if a studio did put more money in to it, then there would be nervous execs wanting to make it more mass appeal, so it would have been a different film, undoubtedly less violent. Here, those constraints are not evident, so no specacular epicness of the world, but buckets of brutality. It made Dredd a hard hitting visceral experience, and it works very well indeed.<br />The writing is clever enough to justify the limited scope, and the film works in terms of flow and plot. Two judges, one a legend, one a rookie, trapped in a confined space with no escape, a psycho gang intent on killing them. It's an inspired piece.<br />I've read comparisons with Nolan's Batman, but Dredd does what Batman can't. Personally, I find Batman limited on lots of levels, Dredd is a far superior character, and this is a far superiour film than any Batman offering.<br />The scope for Dredd is huge, if only it were given the oppertunity. Everyone's hoping for sequels, me included. The potential is fantastic.<br />I'm just happy that Dredd has at last been given a movie treatment that works so well.
1594135851|5.0|I'm reading it to my 10 year old.  She is enjoying it although some of it is over her head.
B003O86FMW|4.0|W<br /><br />While it was a good read it repeated too much of the storyline from the original hunger games.<br />I will read the last book because I am hoping that since there are no more games there will be a different format to the story.
B006O6F932|4.0|child liked the playset since it is very popular<br />easy for an adult to assemble<br />I would recommend this product
0547884591|4.0|The book is worth every penny. However, there is some information I would rather not know. (Skin a deer) Really. In Miami, I do not think so. The recipes are a little strange not crazy about many of them. The best think about the book is that it has gotten me cooking again. I forgot how much fun and rlaxing cooking can be. I have also become more adventurs with my menu.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is a really great CD it is in really great condition and it looks like it is brand new.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Keeps little ones busy. I have small cousins I often look after and they all love this game. Glad I found it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As perfect a history as the preceding books. Cannot wait to put my reading onto the next books. Simply thrilling.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Yes, I gave this book three stars and to some this may be a little shocking, but there's no need to be offended, this is just my opinion. I feel that this is a good past time book and its definetly not an  \\"oh my gosh, this is so boring book\\". It's interesting in a weird, lonely kind sort of way because of how it's written. If you've already seen the movie you might be sitting there like \\"Wow I can't believe it, not, I'm tired of reading this for now, but I'll definetly get back to this latter. This is certainly a good conversation book. This is a book that you'll be excited to talk with your friends about. It's not a favorite but it is worth reading and adding to your collection.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|We ordered monday received tuesday ,i was amazed and my granson was thrilled with receiving his dvd ,great product couldn,t ask for better service ,love it ,won,t ever go back to stores.great dvd.<br />thank you
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am a solitaire lover and this one is FREE and like it!! Not to many ads is what i like most Just one between each game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great trilogy, my only complaint.... EL James needs to continue with books 4, 5, 6, etc!  Absolutely loved this book!
B002WDL534|5.0|This was a christmas present for someone.  I have no complaints.  It shipped in a well protected box and arrived quickly.
B000002HRE|5.0|my grndson loved it ,wanted it and i found it here ,great loud sound ,exactly what he wanted thanks again for coming through for me
B000PEX1IE|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandson to watch, it having been one of my favorites back in college. I sat and watched it with him, not sure as to how well it had aged. Although the fashions and hairstyles were pure righties, the comedy was still fresh as it was when I saw it in the theater. Definitely worth the watch!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Everyone was playing Angry Birds so I thought I  try it.  I am either too dumb or too old but I did't see the point.  It would be good for the young or the young at heart.
B004K4GDE4|5.0|This was a christmas present for someone.  I personally dont listen to this artist but it is nice to see vinyl records are still popular.  I have no complaints.  It shipped in a well protected box and arrived quickly.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Poor atmosphere, normally I like time travel themes, but I don't care how this one was handled.  The writers could not make up their minds about what time conventions they wanted to use- single timeline, vs multiple time lines. I think they used both. Bottom line, it did not click for me.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was an amazing book, one of my favorites I've ever read. The sequel was perhaps better. Amazing and impressive for this author's first novel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|When I get tired or just don't want to think anymore that day, I play solitaire.  Sometimes I get carried away and waste too much time but I am 79 so what better do I have to do. Anyway, I am exercising my brain  aren't I?
0880796863|5.0|this is a great set and i loved it from the time i opened it. the book was very useful and helped with using the cards.
B0091WKXKU|5.0|This movie is just great. Watch it, buy it, enjoy it. And the amount of Boston accent is just right... movies like this one and The Departed should be in everyone's film collection.
B007OLYPW2|3.0|This book is very clever academically - complex plot, layers of meaning etc.  If you don't usually read poetry, you might find yourself skimming through these sections of the book.  I found most of the characters not very believable or appealing - particularly the modern day group.  However, it was interesting and mentally stimulating so worth the read.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|I'm in love with this album, my dad is too. I bought this because my mom was getting him a turntable for Christmas and he really wants to purchase the Beatles remasters but hasn't been able to bring himself to it.
B008KPIN9C|5.0|This is yet another example of  non-commercial music giving a beat-down on mass-produced sacchrinic pablum. Two Gallants have yet to put out anything that aesthetically offends people with a taste for good music. If you want crap, get thee to the SONY label.
B000FA5STS|3.0|Very intricate read. I thought the story line was a little complicated and difficult to follow. However I enjoyed it for the most part even though I had to read a few chapters twice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Being a fan of the 'Fallout' video game series I couldn't help but to check this out when I accidently ran across it.<br /><br />There are very few times in my life when something far exceeded my expectations but this was one of them.<br /><br />The way Hugh Howey writes, I could almost taste the different levels of the silo, just mind blowing!<br />Others may call Hugh's writing too descriptive, but for me it's the difference between another McDonald's hamburger or the rare treat of a Ruth's Chris steak.<br /><br />Plus I can't believe what this is selling for, it would be like going to see 'Saving Private Ryan\\" at the theater on opening day for a dime and them throwing in a bag of popcorn and a Coke to boot.<br /><br />Five stars!
B004J4WKDI|5.0|Love it!  The development of characters was intricate and intriging always leaving you wanting more.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B00AKKS278|5.0|The Miracle Morning- This is the best personal development book I've read in a long time. One of the best ever.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|when I bought it it was fun at first now it is just kind of pointless all you do is make coins fall and get worthless prizes on your tablet
B008476HBM|4.0|I loved the story and all of the characters were so relatable. My favorite though was Mr. Bennett. He was hilarious with his sarcasm and dry humor.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I tried giving 30 day shred a fair chance 5 different times. I workout 6 days a week and am in relatively good shape and this was just miserable for me. It made my knees and my back hurt terribly. I got bored with the workouts quickly and felt absolutely zero desire to ever put myself through that agony again. I will most certainly try other avenues for getting into shape.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|SPOILER ALERT  One guy (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with his friend's (new) wife Another guy is in love his secretary, even though he's married, and has children (bottom 2 images on dvd cover) The old singer (Bill Nighy) confesses his love to his manager  If the above is for you then maybe you'll enjoy this flick.  I wanted to try and like this movie because of the decent cast, but I just couldn't.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is totally awesome in every way!!! it is definitely worth $2. really its worth $8. its way better than minecraft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I heard an interview with the author on NPR during a time period that I was leading a team of people in preparing for<br />a presentation that could influence the course of action for a particular group.<br />Information about how to be attuned to the needs of your &#34;audience&#34;,  maintain empathy and integrity while being persuasive is very valuable.
B003274QH6|5.0|This show is a roller coaster of emotion and chaos. It is well written and well cast and takes the viewer through quite an ordeal with their experience. It was not quite as funny as I had hoped but it did have some situational humor that kept it from being too heavy. It has quite a few gruesome scenes and is definitely not for the weak of stomach.
B009VL28W2|4.0|Just love it !!! excellent concert !!  I live in Quebec !! That was a great show !!  A voir Absolument !!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is flipping amazing<br />SO. ADDICTING!!!!<br />Everyone should read this bc its honestly great<br />LET ME TELL YOU ASDFGHJKL
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very inspirational story.<br />Adam Brown is a true American hero. This book motivated me to live my life without fear and with a passion for Christ.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I have watched Harvey on the television for years. I laugh every time, even though I know most of the dialogue by hearts. The DVD on a HD screen is amazing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I generally like my characters a little less flippant than these and I had chalked this story up to a light read.  But I was intrigued because I couldn't figure out which character was actually as they presented themself or as those around them thought of them.  As I got into the story, it got better and better and that seems to be the pattern.  Just as I thought I was about to get bored again because I felt I knew what to expect, the author would surprise me.  It is well written; it is a unique approach to a relationship story and a personality type that God forbid I hope I never meet.  Worth the read, definitely.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is my third cd as I listened to it so much the others have scratches or skip... One of my favorites!
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|This CD is a great production of some of Whitney's hit songs that my wife and I  enjoy listening to
B008602KQI|3.0|I liked this movie better when it was called Battle Royal. From the plot, to the twists and turns, this movie is identical in every way to the film Battle Royal. It's an interesting concept, but it has been done over and over.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really liked it until the end, and that was bizarre.... she needed to go to prison.... unless there is a book 2?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed was amazing! The trilogy as a whole held my attention the whole time and I couldn't wait to turn my kindle on to continue reading!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was good! Slow at parts but interesting throughout whole book. Also, how things were put into perspective was interesting. Loved it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun app. Works great on my KF. Good color and the hint feature will help you out if you get stuck. Fun. Get it.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Untra Lightweight would be one description, flimsy is another.  They sound ok, but, while putting them on or taking them off they bend every which way.  They have not broken, they just have no physical substance.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Stacking the blocks can be a little challenging but it keeps the kids busy for a while. Even my 3 year old can stack them, but sometimes just makes up his own towers. Sometimes they challenge each other to the tallest tower, widest, etc. Creative, fun, and not a video game.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|If you are a fan of epic fantasy with a nasty edge you must read this novel!  This book really has no heroes but it has plenty of characters, flawed, evil, memorable characters.  I highly recommend it.
B000JKA1MS|5.0|These knight/horse combinations actually stay together well during play, eliminating alot of frustration from my 3 year olds day.  This particular horse is an anatomically correct stallion, which led to some awkward questions, but it is a solid toy.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I had seen this movie a while ago and wanted to own it. It was such a good price. I am so happy to have it in my collection now.
B000002AGN|5.0|This album was given to me by my brother  in the late  50's and it began the love affair I now have for Jazz, but now all genres of music. I am sure that most music lovers have heard &#34;Take Five&#34; played by someone in some way. If you have not, your mission is to do so ASAP and enjoy.
B006MW3V6U|2.0|i love this series but when playing instantly it kept stopping and i had to reload to be able to finish the episode.  i know it is amazons connection because my netflix works perfectly fine.
0811875040|3.0|If you have a lot of time for baking-- and I mean a lot of time-- and a lot of money to spend on baking supplies and ingredients then you will love this book.  I had the delusion that I was going to step up my baking game and learn some fancier recipes and techniques.  I was very excited about this and fell for the book's charm with it's whimsical fonts, scalloped pages, beautiful color scheme (I'm a sucker like that), and of course all the adorable pictures of teeny delectable cakes and pastries.  My first project was the cake on the cover which seemed simple enough.  First, I had to spend another $30 or $40 on cake making supplies like 6\\" cake pans, an icing bag, a spinning plate, a frosting spatula, and a candy thermometer.  Then I had to buy all the ingredients which cost me another $20 (fresh raspberries, cake flour, butter out the wazoo, etc.).  This cake took days to make.  That is not an exaggeration.  DAYS.  Between making the frosting, baking the cake and cooling it, and then finally assembling the darn thing I felt like I was a slave to it.  Not to mention the fact that a piece of 240 degree sugar leaped out of the saucepan and burned my arm so bad that I still have a scar over a year later! Thankfully all the work paid off because it tasted absolutely delicious and was probably one of the best cakes I've ever eaten even though it looks nothing like what is pictured on the cover.  I follow the directions to the letter but my cake looked like the cover picture cake's ugly stepsister.  Needless to say, I didn't attempt any other recipes after that disaster.  Clearly I need to take a baking course before attempting any more of these fancy recipes!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is a really cool product. The top comes off to become a Barbie Swimming pool, without the mess.  It has a picture of a pool and my kids seem content with that.  Also it unzips on the sides to make a runway or play mat. Very fun and cute product.  My kids do not zip it and use it as a storage cube. Instead they keep it unzipped on two sides, leave the other two sides up, so it looks like a room to a doll house. Well made, good graphics.  Also it is not a cheap plastic. It is almost like a plastic coated canvas of some sort.  Not like the cheap plastic we so commonly see these days.  Very unique, more &#34;playability&#34; than storage &#34;ability.&#34;  Lots of fun to spark the imagination!!!!!!  To be clear about the storage, yes it would be great storage but your daughter will want to play with it instead.
1401937268|5.0|This is a beautiful tarot deck. The detail is AMAZING. Each tarot card has very unique art work and very accurate readings. The deck comes with a nicely made booklet that tells you some background information on tarot cards and then it goes into detail about each card.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Loved watching the all-star cast have a lot of fun with the characters. Cute movie, not profound, but enjoyable to watch.
B007SGM084|3.0|Erotica reading.  E L James did not know about Patriot Act in the USA.  The setting is Seattle or Oregon.  No bank can allow withdrawal in cash in the amount stated in her Trilogy of Fifty Shades.
1400062756|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make a positive change in their life. You have a coice to make - fixed or growth and the author spells it out brilliantly. Read the paperback and gave it to my brother and I oredered the Hardcover to keep as permanent reference.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|With all the hype...I was expecting an 'explosion' of energy from this album. It was pretty mellow....however, if you watched the PBS special debuting this album..that was terrific!
B006O6EOII|5.0|I bougth 3 Monster high dolls, they arrived in good<br /><br />conditions and my daugther was the happiest for this shop
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the book initially, but became disappointed midway.  I still don't understand why he would stay with such a manipulative evil person.  But it was fiction so it could go anywhere, and it did.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Enjoyed it and thought it was far superior to the stallone film. I hope they make a sequel and start a film series of Judge Dredd.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|The story line was good, went into the religious side a bit too much for me,all together a  enjoyable read!
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I really like the product, and it got here really fast too, thanks for everything.<br />I would definitely recomend it
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I am an avid reader but have never read a single boom written  by Stephen King. I believed he wrote stories that were too scary for this reader. But I heard so many good reviews and I have always been fascinated by the conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination I took a chance.  It was SO worth it, this book is simply amazing!  It's intriguing, thought-provoking, captivating and ridiculously addictive!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 9 year old son absolutely loves this game!!  Definitely worth the money. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is the absolute best note app that you can get. I have it for both my kindle and my Android. It's simple and reliable. I don't recommend any other app over this one. Thanks for giving the customers what they need (:
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Been running for two years. Read Born to Run. I received a kindle for Christmas and this was my first book.  Loved the read.  I have always been in shape but never ran.  My first husband died in 2001 of pancreatic cancer.  We dove into a macrobiotic diet which was extremely healing.  The recipes are all the same foods I used to eat.  I lost touch with the healthy eating.  Now with the running, I am going back to the healthy eating and its making a huge difference.  Although I can confidently say I will never run an ultra, I will be running Boston in 2015!  (When I picked up running, I found out I was fast.  And now, I know how to sustain my endurance over the long miles.)  Thanks for this wonderful book.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|It was a present, parents loved it.  This is a great gift for anyone who loves musicals.  An unexpected surprise.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|it was really fun until the tutorial. kept freezing the game when i had done that task already. had to uninstall and reinstall
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read.  I couldn't put it down.  I sat down on New Years Day and began reading it in front of a warm fire.  I finished it that day.  I am a State Police Officer in Texas with a lot of Tactical Training and experience and the writing put me there with the Operators of the Teams.  I'm going to read it again just to make sure I didn't miss any details.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the subtleties of the Dynamic Tactical Entry scenario.  It was fantastic.
1451695195|5.0|Terrible title -- as a graduate theologian, I can assure you that no matter what Aquinas or modern apologists say, there are no &#34;proofs&#34; in this matter -- but a very important book. Here is the account of the experience (dreams? hallucinations?) of an agnostic materialist neurosurgeon after he was declared brain-dead from ultra-rare bacterial meningitis and his doctors were discussing removing life support just before he opened his &#34;dead&#34; eyes. It's an illuminating account tending to confirm the intuition of Wilder Penfield, who gave us the modern map of the brain, that the mind is not the brain and the brain is not the mind, or in other words, is non-local. The mind uses the brain but is not the brain. This is more or less the same as saying the television set does not originate the show. It receives the show and manifests it rather than leaving it hovering in the airwaves, but it is not the origin. Nice neurological heresy for our materialist time, much closer to modern physics than to your average practitioner's conception of medicine. Not so incidentally, it's a powerful argument against the concept financially so profitable to hospitals of &#34;brain dead&#34; which allows them to &#34;harvest&#34; organs, just a civilized step or two above the moral level of Chinese prisoner execution for the same.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Outstanding<br />Marvellous need extension plz extension I have too per bye fair well this book is so good I loved it
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Laugh out loud funny... and while it skims briskly past much goings on.<br />Ozzy has a true voice and he is very honest.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of his music (I am not) to enjoy this edgy &#34;been there, done that&#34;<br />expose. It's terrific.
B0037RDPEG|4.0|I enjoyed the experiences in the book but I kind of just felt like I had been invited to the author's pity party.  Good light read over summer though.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Hope springs, I like the movie.  I would watch it again. it wasn't a fun movie i didn't think anyway. hope springs,
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector is typical of Clancy's novels, heavy with techno facts and chocked full of acronyms for a drove of government agencies and mysterious military units. Also common to Clancy's work this novel is meticulous in setting up the international chain of events leading up to the intrigue, clandestine action and ultimately, war violence. There does seem to be more character development than in many previous works however and the novel's theme of worldwide cyberterrosim is one that is fresh to most readers and one that most would grant as a plausible plot line.<br /><br />The book's action led by hero Jack Ryan, Jr. is first rate escapism though and the theme of cyber-terrorism shoud prove popular to the many  techno-addicted readers that have been reading Clancy throughout the years. Even for those that aren't so inclined one can't help but wonder, could this really happpen?
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I confess I missed the first season but discovered this amazing DA series mid way into the second season.<br />This blue-ray package is fantastic and a very enjoyable way of learning the background and flow of the story.
B0034FJGEY|4.0|A book about the Rwandan genocide written from the UN perspective - a damning indictment on the UN to be honest. It was a little too &#34;detaily&#34; for me but I suppose the author can only write from what he knows. it was good to get another perspective on what really went on and why the west did nothing.
B008JAGZDE|2.0|american reunion i like it. I would watch it again. i though it was fun.  I would buy it. I don't now what more i can say about it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm so sad the book has ended. It was such a good book. I can't wait to see the movie..
B007HO392S|5.0|My daughter really likes this CD which she listens to on her way to and from work each and every day.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Shipping was fast and safe!!! My boyfriend loved receiving this as a Christmas present. It was the topic of many Christmas day conversations...absolutely AWESOME!!!
B005F82X48|5.0|If you are a fan of Paramore and Flyleaf....then Icon For Hire's Scripted is what you are looking for!<br /><br />Cleaner vocals and more meat and GUSTO than those other bands. Energy is off the charts on most of the songs and the couple of softer songs (which are incredible) are just enough so you can catch your breath and get ready to get pumped and take off again.<br /><br />I never heard of them and the song \\"Pieces\\" came over Pandora...I was sold the 1st time I heard it and downloaded the album ASAP.<br /><br />Wish I would of heard from them earlier as I'm digging every song on this album. Can't wait to see what the future holds for Icon For Hire.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was a pretty good book for three-fourths of it, but it sort of lost it's way and seemed Grisham just wanted to get it out of the way
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Movie its bit confusing.<br />Different actor subject almost the same<br />there's no real subject inside its just<br />action.looks like its all about what after<br />jason borne.
0802473156|4.0|I bought this at the reccommendation of a friend before my now husband and I got married. I was pretty sceptical and thought it would be more religious mumbo jumbo about what people think is true about the &#34;real&#34; relationship. Boy, was I wrong. My husband and I both read this and learned so much more about each other which is saying a lot because we dated for 6 years before getting married. It has a lot of insight for everyone. I would definitely suggest this book for everyone and we'll be keeping ours around for a long time!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|4.5 for this one from Clancy. His last two were run-of-the mill average and Teeth of the Tiger from nine years ago was hopeless, but this was better (thank God). Back to old school Clancy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Almost everyone at my school plays it  but what stinks is that you cannot get a bow or bones in peaceful mode
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Full of action and most hollywood<br />famous actors.even most of them<br />they are old actors but you still enjoy<br />the action if you like action and adventure<br />movies.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This is a very good physical representation of the Minecraft video game in lego form. As it is made by Lego, it is good quality material; however, it is overpriced the amount of Legos you receive. Supposedly it is limited in it's production run, so if you choose to view it as a collectible, then it is worth the price. I bought it for my son, who enjoys it for the theme and selection of pieces for future projects.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good stuff from Flynn as usual. Plenty of twist and turns. Hopefully Hurley makes a miraculous recovery, he's one of the better characters in the series.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Zombie Dice is a quick, easy-to-learn game with streamlined rules: (1) roll  specialized dice, (2) collect rolls that result in \\"brains\\" while avoiding rolls that result in \\"shotgun blasts\\", (3) attempt to be the first player to accumulate 13 brains.<br /><br />There is some baseline strategy, mostly limited to deciding whether to \\"press your luck\\" and continue rolling the dice to gather brains at the risk of rolling 3 shotgun blasts and losing your turn.<br /><br />The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate, but somewhere between 2-5 is probably best. If you stick to those numbers, a game will usually take around 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />Overall, the play is amusing, portable, and VERY fast-paced. However, the simplicity is a two-edged sword in this case: most players will get bored after 2-3 sessions.<br /><br />APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE: Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a \\"warm-up\\" between their more complicated gaming sessions. It can be a useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of dice games (due to its innate simplicity). Finally, while this game is based on a zombie theme, the game play isn't strongly connected to that theme -- in other words, even if the player isn't a huge zombie fan, he or she should still be able to enjoy the game fully.<br /><br />OVERALL SCORE: B I'm giving this game a few bonus points for how easy and quick it is to play, but the game has almost no real room for anything other than surface strategy and reliance on luck. It's a great game to play while you're waiting for the pizza to arrive.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Just picked up this game and started to play. Been fun so far. Be sure to allow plenty of time to play as this is not recommended for short time waster while waiting in a line.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Well, I consider myself a child at heart so love many of the Disney animations.  My granddaughter and I enjoyed this little movie.  I love movies depicting fairies and the beauty of nature so knew I would be happy with this one.  Thought the movie was cute and we will no doubt watch it again and again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it i can talk to all my family and friends and chat on it im so happy tht i have it
1596434252|5.0|Having made a career as a graphic designer (that's print, not web) over the past thirty-something years I was totally blown away by the creativity and and production quality of this book. I'm still puzzled how it can be produced for such an attractive price. Bravo!
B00A31UXLW|5.0|I could not put this book down.<br />I have a reasonably good track record for working out the plot before the end of the book.<br />Not this time! This is a seriously entertaining book, I didn't want it to end.<br />It was also my first Kindle novel. I just love it!<br />I am off to find another Michael Connelly book for my Kindle now.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use it on both my phone and kindle. very handy. I like how you can create multiple notebooks to organize your notes in.
B005HSL626|5.0|My little brother love this games he plays it everyday when he get home from school and love this ohter games too and palys them alot i cant get them to get off this kindle fire
B002SRQ214|4.0|The processor itself deserves a full 5 stars, however the packaged heatsync does not. The included heatsync cannot keep up with even the most basic office tasks. I suggest purchasing a Cooler Master 212+ to keep up with this products heat generation.<br />Otherwise, this product overclocks like magic and is wonderful buddy to have while gaming.<br />Get this product!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very good detailed book. For anyone who has ever had any type of fantasy this will make you have a whole entirely new out look.  Certain parts will push you over the edge
B002RVEDE4|5.0|I enjoy history and this is a great historical snap shot into Leonards talent.  I do wish that it was more complete but am very happy to have what there is.
B0086700CM|5.0|My little brother love this games he plays it everyday when he get home from school and love this ohter games too and palys them alot i cant get them to get off this kindle fire
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a page turner that was hard to put down. Great mystery and suspense that just kept on going.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is amongst the best books I've ever read the full story is thrilling and full of surprises and suspense.
0765325950|5.0|It was an ending, and it was amazing.<br /><br />The story was great, tied loose ends and left me sad/happy at the end. I loved it, and will be recommending the series to others.<br /><br />I could tell when the writing transitioned from Sanderson to Jordan, but it was a fine transition.<br />Like hearing an old friend again.<br /><br />Some spoilers!! --------<br /><br />Positives: It tied up the series in a way that stayed consistent with the wheel of time themes and plot. It was exciting and a fun read.<br /><br />Issues: Some of the deaths of the characters, even well known characters, happened so quickly I felt rushed. Like 'this happened, that happened, and then dead. Then this happened and we are over here now.' Like it was a checklist for getting to the end. Sanderson never quite got Mat right.<br /><br />Beyond that though I thought the book was great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My little brother love this games he plays it everyday when he get home from school and love this ohter games too and palys them alot i cant get them to get off this kindle fire
B007NESBK2|5.0|Excellent video and sound quality. If you like Sade, then you can't go wrong with this blu-ray. x x x
B004DLPXAO|4.0|If you enjoy reading books it gives you the opertunity to fine just about any type of book you could ever want
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Truly enjoy the Drawing Pad.  I can't draw a lick, but it's fun to play with.  You can draw, play word games or even paint, there is a lot to do with this.  I love it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My granddaughter love playing Angry Birds games. I play the Angry Birds games one time but I am not into playing games I only have this game for my granddaughter she love it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|seemed to disconnect from original facts/info to final plot? maybe i just lost it? the ending was put together well. i felt as end neared main character would be caught.
1432794426|5.0|This is an excellent book, and I appreciate the positive information about Michael Jackson.  He is a true genius.  I met the author at the MJ Fanvention in Gary this summer (2012) and she is a great lady.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!!  However, it certainly is not for the closed or conservative mind.  If Brokeback Mountain made you cry, watch this movie to make you laugh.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My granddaughter love playing Angry Birds games. I play the Angry Birds games one time but I am not into playing games I only have this game for my granddaughter she love it.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|too laggy. downloaded it from the play store and it runs flawlessly! nearly perfect port from ios to android. i dont recommend getting it from amazon.
030758836X|5.0|There are few thrillers or mysteries that I've been as fascinated by as \\"Gone Girl.\\"  Although the pattern of \\"bad things happen to bad people\\" is pretty common in this sort of \\"dark\\" genre, here it isn't really quite clear who (if anyone) is really bad.  The complexity and lack certainty that infuses the novel is haunting.  For me, Gillian Flynn really solidifies herself as a top-notch author with this one.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Works great and did exactly what it is supposed to. Great deal for the money. They make me write more than I have to to post this. It is a decent product, really.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Science fiction is again proven to be an wonderful platform for revealing the ruthless nature of political and military leaders.  After the Earth is attacked by an alien insect species, an all-out, generations-long war ensues to utterly annihilate the aliens from the galaxy.  Only one final thing is needed to successfully win the war, a child prodigy - a leader so brilliant and ruthless that even the psychic powers of the aliens cannot defeat him. Generations of training genius children in an off-planet space station / military academy has not produced the leader they need until they discover 'Ender', a gentle six year-old who can only be pushed so far until he reacts with violent lethality.<br /><br />This story is a treatise on the conflict between the need to defend humanity and the brutality of training new generations of young men to be war fodder.  Orson Scott Card's masterpiece, Ender's Game, is a brilliant insight into the depraved and perhaps necessary inner workings of the military minds who brainwash young people in political doctrines and train them as soldiers to alter them into lethal weapons of war.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is amazingly awesome I bought it for my daughter she wouldn't stop playing it. You should really get this game
B00632HWOG|5.0|For Yahoo Mail users, there is now a long way around and a short direct route. Works well. WHat can I say?
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|This is the worst waste of time and money ever. No real plot. No real substance. Has some cute moments (not many). So much stuff does not make sense. Whoever wrote this was into serious drugs. Way too &#34;out there&#34;.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|Bought this mainly for #1 song, but the rest is growing on me.......is becoming more popular and he has a great voice...........

B00005AXKF|5.0|This is one of the best written and scored Disney movies.  A family favorite that I would recommend to all ages!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The book is very entertaining which actually makes me wonder about the price. Mrs. Kelly keeps you guessing while making you understand and sympathize with her two main characters. The book is well worth reading if you just want to have some fun.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of my favorite authurs. He keeps you interested clear to the end of the book.  Could not put the book down.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I wanted to add this to my personal library, and it's perfect. I know I'll enjoy reading the books again.
B007XHWROK|4.0|His songs are beautiful, no doubt.  However, I bought this for my daughter- a true fan and the same age as Bieber.  She was very disappointed when we discovered his used of a four-letter word in one of the most beautiful songs!  He was doing fine steering clear of that stereotype and then he fell right into it.  C'mon Justin!
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I love her voice and the songs were absolutely lovely. I could listen to her sing 24/7 and not be bored with her music.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This usually is  my type of book due to the violence, but I did find it very interesting.  I could not put the book down.
B004LWZW88|1.0|We hated this movie.... We were told that this movie was good, but NO WAY.  BORING, don't waste your time

B00AESN8XY|5.0|First of this game is worth the money. A fun strategic game and if you love games were you wipe out humanity and take over the world than it's the game for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Thanks to Amazon Prime, I finally am catching up to the rest of those already hooked on this series. We don't choose to have regular television so this has been a fun option, thank you!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|it's okay, it gives your local weather information<br />and thats a good thing. can't say i'd recommend it or not...
0517548232|5.0|Hazlitt sets out the lesson of his title in chapter one, and in the rest of the book illustrates it with examples from many different areas of the economy.  Along the way he argues that attempts by the State to direct the economy are almost always harmful.  As the title suggests, no economic knowledge is assumed of the reader.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it's an ok game still needs a few more things but other than that nothing wrong with it I love the game and it was totally worth the money.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was another great Nicholas Sparks book. It wasn't as mushy as some of the other books. It had a lot more dark substance. I just finished reading the Hunger Games before this book so that might have influenced my opinion. I would definitely recommend reading it!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I have loved playing all the Angry Birds games.<br />this one is so much more fun,now, that i play it on my new Kindle fire.<br /> ROFLOL,<br /> I can really see what i'm doing.<br />LOL
