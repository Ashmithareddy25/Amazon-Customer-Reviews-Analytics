B000000OA6|5.0|You must buy this.  It is incredible.  The music is full of emotion, beatiful melodies.  It is a dark album, but ultimately the message of the album is that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I've lived with this cd during some of my darkest moments and it always, always helps.  You owe it to yourself to buy this cd.  It will change your life.
B0001L3MI0|3.0|nice effects but very cheesy many plot holes and bad acting skip unless you are a fan of someone in the cast!<br />See Deep Impact or The Day After Tomorrow instead
B00003CXCT|4.0|We all knew that when they released the THX Star Wars Trilogy back in 1995 that that was the last time we'd see the original versions.  That release funded the restoration and changes made for the Special Edition.  So if you want to be purist, watch it in its original crummy quality on VHS, or be total geek and get the LaserDiscs if you want better video quality.  I for one am excited to see the special edition on DVD.  The changes and improvement relieve some of the hoakiness and cheapness of the theatrical versions.  DVD is a modern format for modern movies, why not put the most modern version of Star Wars on DVD.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Man, I hate it when people make ignorant comments in a futile attempt to explain something they can't grasp.  To wit: all those reviewers who say we only listen to this because it's \\"angry and popular.\\"  I can't stand most of what's on the radio nowadays.  But I don't need to explain myself to those morons.  I like what I like.  After coming out with a great debut album, bands invariably tend to disappoint with their second effort.  I still don't consider this as good as Hybrid Theory, but it's a much more solid effort than I had originally percieved it to be.  I think what I like the most is the fact that, though rap and screaming vocals are probably the easiest singing styles to have descend into tuneless, uninspired quick fixes, this never happens here.  They're always kept in check with the rest of the song, and actually enhance, rather than detract from, the experience.  In my opinion, the vocals are what makes Linkin Park stand out from the rest.    1. Foreword (1/5) - The principle of a Foreword/Introduction track is always troublesome to me.  It seems like the band is trying to trick us into thinking we're getting more tracks for our money than we actually are.  Pretty much a pointless track that could have been combined with the following song or eliminated altogether with no regrets.  2. Don't Stay (4/5) - I like the way their voices overlap here.  It creates a nifty effect.  3. Somewhere I Belong (3.5/5) - Their first hit off the album, and not a bad choice, but neither is it great.  4. Lying from You (4/5) - Another energetic track.  5. Hit the Floor (4/5) - Much more aggressive than previous songs; borderline metal.  6. Easier to Run (4.5/5) - Chester displays a really nice voice here.  A very different tone from the others--a little more sad, virtually no aggression.  7. Faint (4.5/5) - Very cool track.  I love the instrument at the beginning.  Also pretty aggressive.  8. Figure.09 (4/5) - Kind of a stupid name, really.  But the song is better.  9. Breaking the Habit (4/5) - More in the vein of Easier, with few traces of anger.  10. From the Inside (4.5/5) - Sounds much like the others, but somehow is just a little better.  11. Nobody's Listening (3.5/5) - Needless to say, a little \\"different\\" than the rest, but not bad for what sounds pretty experimental.  12. Session (4.5/5) - Hated this the first time I heard it, but now I stand at the opposite end of the spectrum.  Sounds like the soundtrack for a shockwave introduction to some business website or something.  13. Numb (5/5) - GREAT song.  Hits me with the same emotional power as Crawling used to, and thankfully it hasn't been overplayed on the radio as the latter song was.    The band's sound has changed slightly from Hybrid Theory to Meteora, and this one seems a little more \\"pop\\" or something, but as you can see I enjoyed it for the most part.  Their insistence on \\"bridging\\" all the tracks together irritates me for some unknown reason, but that's really a minor thing.  This definitely deserves to be listened to, but give yourself a few tries to get used to it before you decide you love it or hate it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|in response to the review below about how it's &quot;just a movie&quot; and actors aren't paid to be real.<br />I don't really fall in line with the &quot;imagine a perfect ending&quot; idea, my take with the abrupt ending is that, life keeps on going. Their stories aren't over. It wouldn't be real (yes, i'm saying &quot;real&quot; *gasp* movies? real? what?) if there was some slam-bang finale because that's not what life is about.<br />You said that movies are about compelling images and brilliant characters. Movies, Theatre, Music, everything is about life. This movies is about life. And sometimes life is boring. Sometimes people are lackluster and boring. The movie's not about being openly brilliant and spectacular. It's about the subleties.<br />As for actors being real. Acting...no matter what character you portray, you'll always be showing some facet of yourself. It's actually pretty hard to be &quot;real&quot;, which no...gloss and performance. Some people don't realize it. On the topic of these actors being real, I don't think Scarlett J. did a fantastic job of it. She was good, but Bill Murray was better.<br />Art's about life. Sometimes it's surreal, sometimes it's fantastic and wild, but it's still about life. This movie is about life at a standstill.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is probably the only CD I've ever listened to that I fell in love with on the first try.  It usually takes me three or four listens to adapt to the band's style before I can determine whether or not I like it.  I guess Linkin Park and I were just meant to be.  On to the song-by-song review.<br />1. Papercut (4.5/5) - Great way to start out a strong CD.<BR>2. One Step Closer (4.5/5) - Violent and quick, like a passionate physical attack on your lover.<BR>3. With You (4/5) - I've never been crazy about it, but it's a pretty good song.<BR>4. Points of Authority (4.5./5) - A teen's typical relationship with his or her parent, I suppose.<BR>5. Crawling (5/5) - Linkin Park turns to any and all sounds to make a unique intro, even draining water.  Somehow, it seems to fit the tone of this beautiful, powerful song.<BR>6. Runaway (4.5/5) - I like the flow of this song.  It's very smooth and natural.<BR>7. By Myself (4/5) - Strange buzzer sound annoyed me at first, but now I'm used to it and can enjoy the rest of the song.<BR>8. In the End (5/5) - Welcome change of pace.  Very relaxed, with loud singing but no actual screaming, and a wonderful use of piano that really captures a sense of betrayal.<BR>9. A Place for my Head (4/5) - The beginning of the Forgotten Tracks (no pun intended).  Good songs, but not great.<BR>10. Forgotten (4/5) - Not bad, but not particularly memorable.<BR>11. Cure for the Itch (4.5/5) - Nifty little song, this is. Very whimsical and catchy.<BR>12. Pushing Me Away (4/5) - I always thought this sounded like the singer is a Muppet.  Don't ask me why.  Good song, though.<br />I wouldn't rate too many CDs a 5, but this easily makes the grade.  Any weak tracks are made up for with the perfection of Crawling and In the End.  No song here rates lower than a four, and that really is an incredible accomplishment.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System has definitely taken the political aggro-rock throne from RATM.  I'm not sure if I like this or Toxicity better, but at this point in time Steal This Album! is definitely the most relevant.<br />1) Chic 'N' Stu 4/5: Nice opener, funny lyrics but a bit repetitive.<BR>2) Innervision 5/5: One of their best songs yet.  Great drum beat and the lyrics are great.<BR>3) Bubbles 4.5/5: Fast-paced and loud.  Lyrics are good.<BR>4) Boom! 5/5: Best anti-war song of recent vintage.<BR>5) Nuguns 3.5/5: Not a bad song, but not their best either.  Somewhat annoying.<BR>6) A.D.D. 5/5: Right back to top-notch material.  One of their better songs.<BR>7) Mr. Jack 4/5: Just not fast enough for my taste, but it is a good song.  Lyrics in particular.<BR>8) I-E-A-I-A-I-O 4.5/5: Awesome, but .5 off because I'm not sure there's really a point to the song...<BR>9) 36 1.5/5: Only good thing about this track is that if you think about it, this is their 36th track- 13 on SOAD and 14 on Toxicity = 27 tracks, this is the 9th on STA.  Wonder if the band titled the song this on purpose?<BR>10) Pictures 3.75/5: Good rhythm, just not crazy about the lyrics.<BR>11) Highway Song 5/5: Best song on the CD.  Terrific rhythm, great lyrics, and overall outstanding.<BR>12) F**k the System 5/5: Fast, fast, fast, and loud, loud, loud!  Lyrics are good.<BR>13) Ego Brain 4.5/5: If it moved a bit faster it might be the best song on the CD.  Great lyrics.<BR>14) Thetawaves 4.5/5: Interesting sound to the song.  Nice lyrics win brownie points.<br />15) Roulette 5/5: Beautiful lyrics and musicianship all around.  Right up there with Highway Song.<BR>16) Streamline 4/5: Overall a good song, problem is it doesn't really fit that well on the CD.

Those that tried to escape in the elevator are killed.<br />  Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up naked in the shower. The room looks like a suite. She has no memory of how she got there. She is still under the side effects of the nerve gas. A red dress is laid out for her on the bed. She walks around the mansion. Another man, Matt (Eric Mabius) is there in the same situation. Suddenly, soldiers bust into the place. They take them downstairs. They see the Umbrella rooms and the underground Umbrella Train.<br /> The soldiers are James Shade (Colin Salmon), J.D. (Pasquale Alcardi), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and Spence (James Purefoy).<br />  Alice was a soldier too, but her memory is only coming back in bits and pieces.<br />  Their mission is to get to the Hive which is deep under Raccoon City.

0385510438|3.0|Grisham's experimentation with new styles and voices has been an interesting journey for his readers.  This side trip back to Ford County was his first since The Chamber, cast as a first person account of a young man's pursuit of himself.  <BR>    The characters were interesting, and the dialog as genuine as Grisham readers have come to expect.  One thing I have enjoyed about Grisham's legal novels has been his realistic depictions of many ethical dilemma faced by his protagonists.  In The Last Juror, numerous ethical challenges await the young editor whose voice tells the story.  The reader is never sure that Willie recognizes that he is straying, which would not be so problematic if we weren't left to doubt whether Grisham recognizes them either.  He seems very comfortable with the editor as advocate and participant. Willie makes several decisions that seem unlikely or at best ill-advised that Grisham seems to support.<BR>    The book was enjoyable, but I was never tempted to sit up all night to get it finished. On the bright side, I intend to add it to a list of extra-credit readings for my journalism students and challenge them to resolve Willie's problems in ways more appropriate than those he chose.
B00005JMSE|1.0|More mindless action.<br />Those demon dogs looked so fake. When they first appeared I thought \\"well hopefully he'll just kill them & the story will focus on something else.\\" Boy was I wrong!<br />Avoid this stinker.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|From start to finsih I was amazed at how much I could relate-vent thru this CD.
B000244FDW|5.0|The Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice which was previously available only on VHS is now available on DVD!  At the selling price, even those who prefer the 'other' P&P can now acquire this for a song.  As much as I enjoyed the A&E version, it was this version that got me hooked onto Jane Austen work, so I'm rather partial.  Since its been so long since I saw this version of P&P, my only reservation is that it may not live up to my fond memory of watching it the first time.  So for now, 5-stars for the fond memory - like a good friend!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This movie is hardly what I expected going into the theatre. Sure the second wasn't that grand but it was interesting in a way. One of the things that made the first two movies so watchable was the last second survivals when all seemed lost. And awesome use of techno music. In the third, painfully abrupt deaths replace last second saves.The one notable worthy change is the Orchrestrated music which summons a grandiose level that is perfect for the conclusion to a trilogy.<br /> This movie's pacing is very weak not even comparable to the earlier movies, at times not looking sure of it's intended direction or audience for that matter. Scenes just run on till a change of pace is decided. Unlike the first two movies there are no  memorable moments anymore to think of. Scenes are cool for seconds not even minutes. Even the final fight scene is interesting at first then becomes just another one of many scenes that had enormous potental but squandered it to waisted opportunitys. <br />Questions posed are left up in the air and I don't mean in some mysterious mystical way, I mean not explained at all.<BR>Can anyone explain how neo gets trapped in the train station to begin with. I red a thesis from someone who hailed the movie a masterpiece and theorized that the merovingian made it happen. No, that's not it. Because on closer inspection even the merovingian is baffled, he goes so far as to ask trinity how it happened.<br />Finally,the worst and final straw here is that this movies climax manages to undermine the other movies that came before it.<BR>In the annals of modern cinema, this is huge.... This movie will go down as the biggest dissapointment, the biggest disaster in movie history. Mainly for what it is and partially for what it was supposed to accomplish.<br />nuff said
B0001UL7RY|1.0|no question about it, this album is definetly different from her last. it seems she has taken all the critisism from her last album and tried to reverse it on this one. the songs are better written, have more guitar, deeper lyrics, etc. but in no way is this rock. the songs, when stripped down, are simple pop songs. they are pop songs masquerading as rock songs. <BR>       the song &quot;dont tell me&quot; deals with an extremely worn down subject that we have all heard before. i guess thats the point. if you sing something that doesnt cause people to think, theyll listen to it more. &quot;he wasnt&quot; could have come out of a lillix album with all the yeah yeah's and na na na's. &quot;how does it feel&quot; is ridiculous. &quot;how does feel/to be different from me/are we the same?&quot; shes contradicted herself in the same chorus. &quot;take me away&quot; and &quot;forgotten&quot; are two more songs that desperately want to be rock, but fall short lying in the genre of catchy guitar pop. i admit, i liked &quot;nobodys home&quot; because the subject was not something i would expect from avril, but the 2nd half of the album are just bland, shallow pop song fillers.<BR>       yeah, avrils changing, but not as much as it might look. she still cant write songs, shes still a manafucterd corporate artist, shes still a pop singer, shes still a poser, shes still the same avril. if you are close to being fooled by this album, remember that &quot;sk8er boi&quot; is still the song to sum up and explain avril in her entirety (i.e. not a lot)
B000002GJS|5.0|Before I mention the other songs from this album, my favorite song on here is &quot;Thought I'd Died and Gone To Heaven.&quot;  It is such a strong record with the bridges and the hanging-with-the-fellows big chorus of woooohhh, wooooooooooodhhhhhhhh.  It is one of Bryan Adams' best songs to date and it should have gone higher than No. 13 on the charts in spring 1992.  But this album is full of big rockers, solid rhythms, and unique songwriting.  I like Do I Have to Say the Words more than the overplayed &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It For You)&quot;.  Everything's kind of LOUD for a power ballad, but that sappiness is all too obvious on that one.  I also like &quot;Can't Stop This Thing We Started&quot;, &quot;There'll Never Be Another Tonight&quot; and the big closer, &quot;Don't Drop That Bomb On Me.&quot;  Three crank-it-to-11 rockers that still sound strong today!  Bryan really got better as an artist with this album!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This is a great album. Avril shows us that she has grown as an artist from her previous album Let Go. On this album she wrote all of the songs with help from Canadian singer Chantal, and her Evan a guitarist in her band. She even gets the help of Ben Moody from Evanescence. <br />1. Take Me Away- This is a good song. It sounds like Unwanted. 10/10<br />2. Together- I love the piano in this song. It's a dark rock song. 8/10<br />3. Don't Tell Me- The first single. This has the same fell as Complicated. It should because her guitarist Evan wrote the music for this song. 10/10<br />4. My Happy Ending- This song is the average rock song from Avril. It has a feel from Sk8er Boi. 10/10<br />5. How Does It Feel- This is the first slow song. It's very similiar to I'm With You. This song definetely shows that Avril grew as an artist. 10/10<br />6. My Happy Ending- Another rock song. It sounds like something that maybe Michelle Branch would sing. 10/10<br />7. Nobody's Home- This is a great song. It's written by Ben Moody and has that Evanescence feel to it. 10/10<br />8. Forgotten- A dark gothic song. Not one of my favorites. 5/10<br />9. Another alternative song. Sounds like naked from her last album. 10/10<br />10. Fall to Pieces- Another slow song. 10/10<br />11. Freak Out- Another average Avril song. 10/10<br />12. Slipped Away- The beginning of the song sounds like My Immortal by Evanescence. It's a sad slow song. 10/10
B000001DV2|5.0|I still love &quot;Adrenalize!&quot;  Though &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot; will always be classics, Def Leppard should be commended for making this album.  The rockers like &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Touch You&quot;, &quot;Make Love Like A Man&quot;, &quot;Heaven Is&quot;, &quot;Personal Property&quot; and others are all superb!  I still love the song &quot;Tonight.&quot; It should have gone to No. 1 instead of No. 62 in the Billboard Hot 100. It's such a nice ballad and Joe Elliott sounds passionate on it.  &quot;White Lightning&quot; is still a strong power ballad that builds up its momentum during its 7 minutes.  Although I didn't like it at first, I like &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot; now.  Took me 20 listens to like it more now.  But the album's other strong point is Mike Shipley producing the album.  Shipley's direction with the album is superb given the shifting rhythms and turns of the songs.  It's a pattern that he has been good at with later albums by Enrique Iglesias, Faith Hill, Andrew W.K., Winger and others.  Because of &quot;Adrenalize,&quot; I respect Mike Shipley's involvement on albums a lot more.  This is still one of the '90s best rock albums and I commend DL for continuing on with its career after losing one of its members, Steve Clark. Steve would have been proud of this album too!
B000001Y5D|5.0|Linda's voice is very warbling yet powerful, so she has a nice balance going on. I've only heard &quot;What's Up&quot; on the radio and seen the video on VH-1, and I'm getting the full CD soon. I can't wait to get it!
B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna's pathetic singing voice makes Britney Spears sound like opera singer Beverly Sills.

B000089RVX|1.0|Is it possible that nobody had noticed? This non original EU band had just copied the italian great band lacuna coil that has a long way carrier with their creative own style. Now Evanescensce is making alot of money with this cd and with the statement that their first goal is to be creative and original. What a lie! Even Cristina´s way of singing is found there!<BR>You better check out Lacuna coil and judge by yourself. <br />PD: one star just for the effort of playing

B0000C3I6U|5.0|The 25th anniversary edition of Pumping Iron is loaded with special features and behind the scenes footage of the making of the self-titled &quot;docudrama.&quot; All the bodybuilders and filmmakers are interviewed, looking back 25 years ago to what really happened. It's amazing to see that a good portion of the film was actually complete fabrication. Nobody ever hid Katz's t-shirt, for example - the scene with Waller saying he was going to hide it actually was shot well after the competition where he lost it. Ferrigno's father wasn't actually involved in his training - they asked him to fake that so they could paint Lou's character differently. These are just a couple of the secrets that are revealed on the DVD. If you are a fan of the film, you need to get this to see how much true info was left out. <br />If you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend it, even if you have no interest in bodybuilding. It's a fascinating look into the world of bodybuilders from a safe distance. This is also the dawn of the golden age of the sport, when it was really just getting started in Venice Beach. <br />This edition of the DVD exposes some remarkable secrets about the original, as well as all the info you could ever want about Arnold. Very entertaining.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|Wow, this is what it's all about.  Watch on a  big screen, and enjoy all the comforts of home that the crew don't have...space!<br />Truly what dvd is all about, an amazing WW2 experience that is rare to find.  You might want to watc it over a two day period, but it is an amazing master piece.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Its so sad that this girl sells albums.  Really, think about it.  She claims to be the &quot;anti-Britney&quot; or whatever, yet writes songs that are just as poppy, and basically aimed at the same audience.  She isn't &quot;punk&quot;...she's corporate pop, and poor pop at that.  If you want to hear decent pop music, listen to something like U2, or even No Doubt...at least they are good songwriters, with music that will stand the test of time.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|i love it. it kida better then the 1st. i love the song forgotten, oh wait i love all of them. its oraginally. and shes canadaian, iam canadaian. she not pop princess crap she sk8 punk good canadaian musican princess. shes a star in her own voice, but i still love my evanescence, iam going to see them. will ilike it its so kool and iam buyin it for my b/f when i have some more flow.

B00005JKO3|5.0|This grand, epic film tells many stories but the main thread is about the selfless, noble sacrifice of the gallant El Cid, Rodrigo Daz de Vivar, who was able to effect an alliance of Christians and Moors to defend Spain against Ben Yussuf and the very real threat of a Moorish invasion from North Africa. El Cid faces many trials and tribulations in his quest for peace and freedom in war-torn Spain, where palace intrigue and plots, treachery and assassinations threaten the country's stability. Charlton Heston's Rodrigo is a man of courage and bravery who is also just and sees the senselessness of killing Emirs and spares the lives of five captives after a battle in order to spare the citizens from Emirs seeking revenge for the killing of their soldiers. Thus begins Rodrigo's long, lonely and often thankless struggle to free Spain from the fear of Ben Yussuf. Rodrigo's battle to defend his father's honor against the slurs made by Chimene's father is only the first of many trials he faces until many years later when the final battle and victory against the Moors is at hand and will bring peace and unity to Spain. Sophia Loren is quite lovely as Chimene who finally embraces Rodrigo as her husband and realizes that it is he who represents Spain's only hope for peace and freedom. The battle scenes are well done, with much of the action shown in close-quarters combat and the beauty of Spain's castles and countryside is captured in beautiful widescreen Technicolor. The superb production has a wonderful music score by Mikls Rzsa that is evocative of the beauty and sorrow of this quixotic land on the Iberian Peninsula...a land of contradictions with its own unique character and mystique.
0618526412|5.0|I love this book and would recommend it to anyone that loves a great book. It was so identifiable.....Some of the characters remind me of myself....I was able to see a bit of Mick, Portia, and Blount in myself....The parts that really got to me were when Blount heard two coworkers talking about him and when Mick was always tired after working.
B000063S6Z|4.0|I usually don't write reviews for C.D.s, but I felt compelled to add my opinion on &quot;18&quot; because I feel this album has been misrepresented by many other reviewers.<br />The main thing that helps in listening to this album is to forget everything else about Moby (mainly &quot;Play,&quot; which this album resembles in only the slightest way).  It also helps to forget We Are All Made of Stars once the track is done playing, since the other songs don't follow its lead (even though that single was, ironically, the reason I bought this album in the first place).  <br />If you just judge the songs for what they are, not expecting a lot of radio-friendly singles (like We Are All Made of Stars, not that I consider it mindless pop but it is something which is commercially equipped) or &quot;Play, Volume 2&quot; you realize that they are quite good.  The barrier to the enjoyment (or popularity) of this album is the expectations that exist because of the success of &quot;Play&quot; and the sometimes quite unconventional nature of the songs.  It's a good album, just not good in the way you're likely to expect it to be.<br />&quot;18&quot; hits higher and more frequent highs than &quot;Play,&quot; in my opinion.  Unfortunately it also has a lower low (Harbour).  But it averages out as a better album.  We Are All Made of Stars is the best vocal techno song I've heard in English (Japanese electronic artist tend to be very good at this format, which seems to elude Western musicians).  Extreme Ways is an excellent &quot;angry rocker,&quot; only with the &quot;rock&quot; part replaced with electronica.  I say that because, with a different instrumental arrangement, these lyrics would be worthy of Dylan or Petty.  But the instrumentals that do back the song are some of Moby's finest work, a layered electronic masterpiece.  In This World is far superior to Natural Blues, which it is naturally compared to.  Great Escape is both a great song and testament to Moby's versatility asa songwriter (it's composed for Classical strings, and is a moving love song like nothing he's written before).  Jam for the Ladies is an enjoyable departure from Moby's usual style (if there *is* anything that can be called his usual style, this isn't it) Then the instrumantal tracks Fireworks and 18 prove that his focus on vocal songs hasn't caused his talent for composing instrumentals to wane.  On the down side, I don't know what these other reviewers have on track 15 of their copies of &quot;18.&quot;  I find Harbour to be not only the obvious weak point of this album, but the most unlistenable song Moby has ever issued under his name.  The lyrics are uninspired, the vocals are poorly delivered, and there's nothing about the instrumental backing to make the track interesting at all.  But it is only a momentary lapse of dignity for Moby.<br />The biggest weakness of &quot;18&quot; is the weakness of all Moby's albums: it fails to hold together as a unified work.  The songs are good (although some are a bit weak, and the album would have benefited from the removal of Harbour and 1 or 2 of the gospel songs, to shorten it to the approximate length of &quot;Play&quot;), but together they seem like just a collection of songs, a singles collection or &quot;best of&quot; compilation, rather than parts of a whole.  Then don't flow and there is nothing which unifies them (although a couple songs are linked to each other).  It seems like Moby just browsed a database he had his 150 unreleased songs on, picked 18 he thought were objectively the best, with no regard to their style or tone, then kept them in the order they had been filed on the database, rather than arranging them in a way that allowed the moods of the songs to compliment each other.  The result is &quot;18,&quot; a good collection of songs, but with almost no feeling of unity.<br />Basically &quot;18&quot; shows that, despite all his other successes evident on the record, Moby has failed to make the full transition from a single artist to an album artist.  It is a good album to own, but it has a number of idiosyncracies that prevent its widespread enjoyment, and some that prevent me from being able to give it 5 stars.  I hope Moby's next (non-Voodoo Child) album maintains these strengths (as well as new innovations) *and* is also able to exist as a unified whole, like all the truly great albums do.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne's second studio album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; takes listeners back to some of the familiar sounds of &quot;Let Go&quot; but also digs further into the total Arvil experience.<br />As a whole, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is generally more phylosophical, and less poetic (alought poetic lyrics are still very much present), than her debut effort. It also features more varied and versatile intros, and a slightly more mature sound, without losing the basic essence of her own style.<br />Probably the best tracks on the album include the debut single &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; which follows the typical Avril sound, and the songs &quot;My Happy Ending,&quot; &quot;Fall to Pieces,&quot; and &quot;Freak Out.&quot; All are catchy and have an appealing beat.<br />Although there are really no bad songs on the album, probably the least profound is &quot;Nobody's Home,&quot; which features more intene lyrics and a typical rock sound.<br />Most of the other songs on &quot;Under My Skin&quot; seems to alternate between the Avril sound we are used to and a harder, edgier, deeper sound.<br />Overall, this album is very promising and should help to keep Avril in the spotlight for some time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed &quot;Let Go&quot; and most lyrical rock fans.
1563898586|5.0|I got this graphic novel after I collected all the books on the chracters in the movie League of Extraordinary Gentleman, And it was great, but I kept wondering where Dorian Gray was. You see his portrait on the front cover, but he's not in the book. You would think since this stroy is based in 19th centry England he would be in this stroy, but no. Anyway this is a great novel to have. It has great graphics, great story, great chracters too. But there are somethings I wish theyed put in there, like how miss Murry is, and I'd wish you could see more of Nemo's crew. One of the many cool things in this book is if you look in some pages there are news papers that say Mars is Volcanic(guess who's gonna drop to earth in the next stroy). Another cool thing in this stroy is when someone is talking to someone in another launge it's written in that launge like Aribic, and Chinese. This is a great novel to add to your collection.
B00005JLXE|4.0|This movie grew on me.  i saw it twice in the theater and many more times on the dvd.  i took objection with some of the liberties the director took with the original story and characters.  i have read every issue of the original comic and know the history and development of the character very well.  i initially recoiled at a black kingpin but eventually conceded that his performance and physical presence was more important than his pigmentation.  jennifer garner looks really sexy but is too campy and silly in portraying what was a very dark character in the books.  i was cringing during the playground dual with matt murdock.  colin farrell was inspired as bullseye.  afleck has stated little desire to do a sequel.  fine.  who needs him.  let someone else zip up the leather and have at it.  foggy was great!  the frank miller born again saga is screaming to be the storyline of the sequel so get on with it.  maybe a spidey crossover?  so many possiblities.  the dvd is very worthwhile with wonderful bonus features.  daredevil is 40 this year.  long live daredevil!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKCH|5.0|The cast was fantastic bringing human emotion to what could have been a dumb effects-driven piece of fluff (anyone remember the last batman movie?) This movie had great pacing and detailed characterizations.  the special effects were very dynamic if at times a bit cartoonish.  the spirit of stan lee and steve ditko's creation of some 40 years ago remains intact with a minimum of updating to be contemporary.  the bonus features are worthwhile and this is a must own for fans of the character, the genre, or general fans of action films.  highest recommendation.
B00005JKC3|2.0|As a long time comic reader i saw this movie in the cinema on release and enjoyed parts of it.  since i am not a kid anymore i appreciated a dramatic cerebral approach to the comic character.  i feel that ang lee just failed in what he was trying to do.  many of the deviations from the original comic origin were unneccesary and arbitrary.  i know an exact reproduction of a comic from the 60s wouldn't stand up in the early 21st century, but to completely rewrite the story is unforgivable.  the hour long wait for the first appearance of the hulk was too much.  i was bored by the talking heads.  i thought the cgi was effective enough and the action scenes were well done.  did anyone else have trouble seeing the fight with the dogs on the dvd?  it is so dark i can barely make out what is going on.  that wasn't a problem in the theater.  i enjoyed the bonus features especially the history of the comic.  i'm not sure if there is a sequel in the works, but i don't think they have a franchise with this kind of interpretation.
B0000214F0|5.0|i had heard the legend of this movie long before i saw it and i really didn't expect much more than sensationalism.  having studied a great deal about the early roman empire, i knew the story of caligula very well.  my surprise at watching this movie was the accuracy of this depiction of the mad emperor to the ancient latin source material.  they could have toned down the graphic sexual content to earn an R rating and possibly draw a larger mainstream audience.  would this have made for a better movie?  not sure myself.  is it pornography?  if the graphic portrayal of human sexuality is the definition of pornography then yes it is in part pornography.  if you are looking for subtlety in a roman emperial story check out i claudius.  if you want the truth, and you can handle the truth then you should buy or rent this one today.  probably not a family night movie, but certainly a memorable one.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|the first xmen movie had to accomplish so much in the introduction of so many characters that most of them as well as the plot itself got short-changed.  that said it was still an enjoyable film.  in this film we know most of the pricipal characters and the essential nightcrawler is introduced in dramatic fashion at the beginning of this movie.  the visual effects are spectacular and several of the actors contribute memorable performances.  not all of them though.  it may not be his fault given the lines he has and minimal screen time, but James Marsden as cyclops seems to prove that it is possible to be at once stiff and limp.  That is a shame because his character is the longest tenured member of the group in the comics as an original member of the 60s xmen and the only original to stick around when the xmen were completely reinvented in the mid 70s.  he deserves a more dynamic role.  maybe in x3 (probably the phoenix story) he will come to life.  hugh jackman is great as wolverine.  and i really like gandalf as magneto.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This CD has some good songs like Take me away, Freak out, Dont tell me, and others, but the rest are just pop punk crap.
B00013F38K|5.0|The best TV Series ever produced.<BR> When the world is at  war everywhere, then comes Kwai Chang Caine to tell us some words of wisdom. People should see the philosophical side of the movie not the physical side.<BR>I bought this DVD to show my children about what is real strengh.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|the kids are amazing.  this is a landmark film in rock biography.  the stories of rock bands had not really been the stuff of feature films at that point.  the movie effectively encapsulates what is special about the who with performances from the beginning to the last performances of keith moon.  as other reviewers noted, the restoration of the film is stunning.  this restoration is all the more evident thanks to special features on the second disk giving before and after examples to show how dramatic the improvements have been.  this set is essential for fans of the band or classic rock in general.  my only complaint is that there was a medley of songs from 60s tv shows that were edited together instead of being shown in their entirety including pictures of lily and magic bus.  why not give us the whole clips? apart from that this collection is flawless.
B0001UZZWW|2.0|Of course, Shrek is a great movie but I bought this thinking that the Shrek 3D was going to be a great addition to our collection - I was completely letdown.  Shrek 3D is 16 minutes long - my daughter was very upset when it ended so abruptly.  If you already own the origianl Shrek, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!
B00004U2G4|5.0|Jeff Beck's career has been ideosyncratic to say the least.  After a successful stint as the lead guitarist for the yardbirds, he attempted a solo career as pop star.  anyone remember &quot;hi ho silver lining&quot; or his cover of &quot;love is blue?&quot; After that he formed the original jeff beck group with rod stewart, ron wood and mick waller.  this band recorded two prototype heavy blues rock albums in truth and beck-ola.  this is the one that stands up the best although both were excellent.  beck's technical virtuosity with stewart's firey vocal delivery packed a mighty punch.  Had this band been able to stay together, jeff beck would now be fabulously wealthy and a household name rather than a &quot;musician's musician.&quot; Jimmy Page is entirely too narcissistic to give anyone else creadit for his inspiration, but if he were honest he would list this album at or near the top.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have to admit, I was a big fan of the old \\"...Baby One More Time\\" Britney Spears.  So when I finally picked up this album, I felt a serious lack of Max Martin, who produced songs like \\"Baby,\\" as well as \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" <BR>\\"Lucky,\\" \\"Stronger,\\" \\"Crazy,\\" \\"Overprotected\\" and loads more.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the alternatives that Spears chose.<br />My favorite dance track instantly became \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\"--although it's a far cry from the Britney sound people are used to, it's still a great hip-hop tune that gets under your skin.  I hated \\"Toxic\\" at first, but it grew on me, as did \\"Breathe On Me.\\"  The weakest aspect of this album, unfortunately, is that Spears hardly sings.  She basically talks her way through \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"Showdown,\\" which are both potentially good songs that her voice made boring.<br />I was impressed with the ballad \\"Shadow\\"--its lyrics were a refreshing break from the over-sexed lyrics of the other tracks (which can get tedious after a while).  Lyrically, it may be one of the best songs Spears has ever recorded.  And on \\"Everytime,\\" you can actually hear Spears's singing voice--as opposed to her usual affected, breathy, nasal sound that only works in some situations.  \\"Everytime\\" is living proof that Spears has been manufactured too much, and if she were left to her own devices (she wrote the song), she is capable of producing melodious, soulful material that completely contradicts the critics' views of her voice.<br />Overall, I don't know if this is my favorite Britney Spears album, but I probably would have liked it better if it wasn't Britney Spears.  She was doing fine with Max Martin.  But she enjoys the music she's making, and she's working hard to make it her best, which, believe it or not, is the mark of someone who is growing into a true artist.  Whether you like her or not, you have to respect that.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The performances were virtually flawless.  the stage was litered with music legends who checked their egos at the door.  even the notoriously egocentric mccartney avoided his natural tendency to dominate the proceedings and did his part as one of the gang.  dhani harrison looked frighteningly like his father is the early beatle years.  i wish i could have heard his voice in the mix.  the concert featured most of george's classics.  highlights include &quot;isn't it a pity&quot; &quot;while my guitar gently weeps&quot; with clapton and mccartney dueting and &quot;something&quot; which starts with the simple ukelele arrangment paul did on his last tour and builds with the full band and orchestra elevating the song to a majestic climax.  hearing these songs back to back by such great talent serves as a reminder of how underrated harrison is as a composer.  while his catalog may not match the lennon mccartney canon, the number of songwriters with that many classics is a short list.
B000063DIH|4.0|A lot of people hate this album because they think most songs here are fillers and the three bad songs.  I don't like those three songs either but I like most of the others with two incredible songs that work everything out.  Janick is a great guitarist by the way.<br />1. BE QUICK OR BE DEAD (9.5/10)<BR>Fast paced riffs and drums make this another great opener.<br />2. FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (8.5/10)<BR>Fourth part of the Charlotte series.  A decent song with a catchy chorus.<br />3. AFRAID TO SHOOT STRANGERS (11/10)<BR>Now this is a great song!  My favorite on the album.  The beginning of the song includes light guitar playing and the help of some keyboards.  Nice lyrics sung well by Bruce.  Drums come in well.  It continues like this for about 2 minutes 45 seconds building up to some sweet ass guitar playing.  The chorus comes in well during the guitar.  Then after a minute of that the song gets even more fast paced with some great drumming and a cool guitar solo.  Then it goes back to that sweet guitar tune for the rest of the song.  A really good song indeed!<br />4. FEAR IS THE KEY (7/10)<BR>This song would've been better if the vocals weren't so damn annoying.  I hate the part when Bruce starts singing &quot;lies and lies and lies&quot;.  Some decent guitar riffs atleast.<br />5. CHILDHOOD'S END (8.5/10)<BR>The guitar intro is awesome but then the song just starts to bore me a bit.  The drumming during this song is done well.<br />6. WASTING LOVE (8/10)<BR>This song has nice guitar work.  A decent song.<br />7. THE FUGITIVE (9/10)<BR>The drumming in the beginning is cool.  The riffs and vocals during the song are done well.  The chorus is alright.<br />8. CHAINS OF MISERY (8.5/10)<BR>This song is alright.  The chorus is pretty catchy.<br />9. THE APPARITION (6/10)<BR>I really don't like this song.  Its boring.  The whole song is just a riff, some crappy vocals, and a solo for almost 4 minutes.  Nothing really changes during this song.  Hear it once if you wantto, just to hear what it sounds like and then just skip it all the time.<br />10. JUDAS BE MY GUIDE (9/10)<BR>This song is pretty good.  A catchy tune with a good chorus and lyrics.<br />11. WEEKEND WARRIOR (6.5/10)<BR>This doesn't sound like any type of Maiden song.  The guitars don't fit in well and sound all goofy.  The vocals are also goofy and the lyrics are retarded (who the hell wants to hear a song about soccer?).  The riffs and singing sound very similar to The Apparition which makes it sound like a slightly better version of it.  I really hate when Bruce sings &quot;maybe someone will die&quot; or &quot;watchoo gonna do on monday?&quot; repeatedly with that goofy sounding guitar tune playing.  What the hell is this?<br />12. FEAR OF THE DARK (10/10)<BR>Ahhhh, much better.  This song makes up for anything bad that you heard earlier.  Now this is a song that has a creepy mood.<BR>Especially the quiet part in the beginning with a guitar playing lightly and Bruce's eerie vocals.  Then the song gets faster all the way up to the end.  I love the riffs in this one.  The only thing I don't like is the repetition of &quot;fear of the dark&quot; being sang over and over.  Great song either way.  A very good way to end the album.<br />I still think this album is worth picking up even though it has three bad songs.  I don't know why Maiden didn't just excluded those songs from the album.  This would've been a great album if it weren't for those cursed songs!
B00008PX8P|5.0|i had all but given up on listening to zep.  they were great but i had moved on years ago.  this dvd reminded me how special they were. i never got to see them on stage so this is as close as i get.  i'd love to see this on a big screen.  the song remains the same was ok, but this collection justifies the legend of the live zep experience.  is there any more in the vault for volume 2?  i enjoyed the interview from 1969 when they very diplomaticly answer questions comparing them to the beatles.  the thought of comparing the two now seems absurd, but zep was near the beginning of their journey and the beatles were at the end of theirs so for a short time the two bands were contemporaries.  this is the definitive visual testament to one of the finest live acts in the history of rock music.
0380002930|5.0|Yep. This is my favorite book of all time. I've read this book so many many times and have never gotten sick of it. Recommended to me by a friend when I was in my freshamn year of high school, I read it in about 2 days and it's been my personal favorite since. The one book I would recommend to EVERYONE. It's got adventure and drama but it's a book about rabbits... you know, like bunnies. It's weird how the rabbits face so many trials, one has horrifying visions, they tell their own myths and legends, conduct wars, and exist in such a terrifying environment. This book could have been about a group of people but from a rabbit's perspective the tale gains so much more depth and meaning. It's probably the only book that actually made me upset when I got to the end of it. Yeah, it's pretty sad... but it's also touching and that proves a lot. It can be pretty hard to find that one book, which is so powerful and well written that you get attatched to the characters and actually get sad when the story is finished.
B000002NJS|4.0|At first, I didn't really like this album of Madonna when I heard it. I was expecting it to sound more like &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; when I first played it and what I heard was the opening with a more slow song that started off nice and quiet. I didn't expect it to be that way at first, but then after a few years, I learned to like it, and now, it's one of my favorite Madonna albums! This is the first Madonna album I owned, and the songs on this album are fantastically brilliant! The first single, &quot;Frozen&quot; is one of my most wonderful favorites of all time and I still like it til this day! &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; is such a fantastically well-made song and I'm glad that the name of this song was this album's album title! Madonna does really well in singing these songs with emotion and power and I'm glad to have owned this album by Madonna. <br />FAVORITE TRACKS:<BR>------------------<BR>&quot;Ray Of Light&quot;<BR>&quot;Frozen&quot;<BR>&quot;Power Of Goodbye&quot;<BR>&quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;<BR>&quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot;<BR>&quot;Swim&quot;
B00005QDW1|1.0|While I did enjoy &quot;Start the Fire&quot; and &quot;Running&quot; a bit it does not make up for the rest of this album. No Doubt used to be fun and refreshing. Now, they've sold out and released a mediocre pop album. Woo hoo. First this then a bad remake of a &quot;Talk Talk&quot; song? I've lost all respect for this band.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|These teen queens just win you with flash and bang crap. The music has no substence. I liked it better when teenboppers bought britney spears and avril lavigne insteead of kidding themselves that this is better and that avril is anti britney and christina. she is just like them and her music is just as bad. nshe gets a one because she sold so many copies when you could have bought good music like The beatles or david bowie or people that actully are differnt like the ramones or good rock with a landie like blondie, but people buy this crap and are blinded by the smoke and mirrors that the media plays on them
B0000DD7LC|5.0|R&amp;B in 2004 has definitely inproved from R&amp;B in 2003 where Beyonce's &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; &amp; Luther Vandross' &quot;Dance With My Father&quot; were clearly the best R&amp;B albums of that year.  Both albums took home no less than 4 Grammys early this year.  &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot; will definitely do the same.  It was released just before 2004 arrived and will definitely take home its number of well-deserved accolades. It is one of the best R&amp;B albums of 2004 and I definitely will give it 5 stars because it is well deserved.  This album is one of my favorites this year.  My favorite songs are:<br />1. Karma<BR>2. Heartburn<BR>3. You Don't Know My Name<BR>4. Diary <BR>5. If I Ain't Got You<BR>6. Dragon Days<br />If you are a fan of R&amp;B, you should definitely have this album in your collection.<br />Other albums released in late 2003-present that I recommend.  The following R&amp;B albums are my predictions for Grammy wins next year:<br />&quot;Soulful&quot; - by Ruben Studdard<br />&quot;Confessions&quot; - by Usher
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I love that these reviews have turned into a \\"Who's been a fan longer\\" arguement. <BR>I completely agree that their sound has eveolved into something bigger... I agree that the have added slower \\"weaker\\" elements... but the bottom line is that this is an amazing record! You have to pull yourself away from the \\"slipknot\\" moniker and from what your preconcieved notion of \\"what is and what isnt\\" Slipknot. They have always been heavy but there's always been a little bit of calm before the storm. Now there is just some calm within the storm. I think this album is a serious accomplishment in metal and music as a whole.<br />Track by track here is my break down:<BR>1.Prelude - Good song but could have expanded on the lyrics a bit more. 8/10<BR>2.The Blister Exists - Now this is a Slipknot song! The drums and guitar on this song are amazing. an emphatic 10/10<BR>3.Three Nil - This song is decent, very good live, for that I give it 7/10<BR>4.Duality - A long the lines of left behind but on a much larger scale. 10/10<BR>5.Opium of the people - I'm indifferent to this one... 5/10<BR>6.Circle - I'm indifferent to this one... 5/10<BR>7.Welcome - I like this one a lot... I enjoy the percussion the most. 7/10<BR>8.Vermillion - ... This is one of the best songs ever written!<BR>It is by far in the top 5 Slipknot songs ever. 10/10<BR>9.Pulse of the maggots - If you're 555 I'm 666! I love Slipknot anthems. 10/10<BR>10.Before I forget - This is a decent song but I can't really get into the chorus. 6/10<br />11.Vermillion 2 - The CD could have done without this... It kind of makes the heavier version look bad. It's not a bad song at all but It should have been some sort of b-side, pt.2 reprises aren't for an album. 7/10<BR>12.The Nameless - This is just another amazing song. The chorus is so powerful and the sample work... all the music is just kick ass. 10/10<BR>13.The Virus Of Life - This song is so hauntingly evil! This song reminds me a lot of Marilyn Manson but metal. 10/10<BR>14.Danger - Indifferent. 5/10<br />So I guess if you average it out I give this CD about an 8/10!<BR>Its a good solid metal album and if you don't have it then go get it!
B000008LL2|5.0|Thunder is one of those 'undiscovered legends' of rock n' roll! If you love hard rockin' music with great hooks, tasteful soloing, and downright incredible songwriting ability, then you simply MUST get some of these guys releases!! And their singer,Danny Bowes, has a voice similar to Paul Rogers (yeah-he's THAT good!),with a hint of David Coverdale &amp; even a bit of Steve Perry. I'd seen the MTV video hit &quot;Dirty Love&quot; from their first album a couple times back in the early 90's. Thought it was a great catchy song &amp; very 'cheeky' video. Heard nothing from them until the local radio played the first cut from this, their 2nd album around 3 in the morning. As usual-the d.j. didn't even say who the song was by. Well, I immediately called the station long distance to find out who wrote this awesome tune. When they told me it was a new tune from 'Thunder', I went out in search of what was this disc 'Laughing on Judgement Day'. When I listened to it, I was completely SOLD on this great band! Do yourself a HUGE favor &amp; get this (amazingly low-priced) disc. You'll soon be scrambling to get their other fine albums/discs as well! And GREAT NEWS-they've since re-formed!! See my review for the latest 'Shooting At The Sun' disc...also a KILLER!! ENJOY
B000092ZYX|5.0|Each new Radiohead album seems to reposition the nature of rock music. Comparisons with the Beatles are inevitable. After listening to each new album, my thoughts seem to shift involuntarily to that other British band.    With Hail to the Thief, however, Radiohead reaches even greater heights. I'm unsure if I have ever heard rock music taken to this level of musical refinement. The rhythms, keys used, vocals, blend of instruments, etc., the lyrics simply an element of each song rather than its focal point, create, in my opinion, a sound wholly descriptive of the world we are living in.     What *does* living in this world of ours today mean? What is it like? More cross-culturally connected than ever before, the immediacy of information transfer so prevalent (yet the distance between our own neighbors so great), our seemingly permanent monuments to man's ingenuity destroyed on a beautiful September morning, presidential elections in the bastion of Democracy stolen in the night: we live in a chaotic age. From within that cloud of chaos emerges the sound of Radiohead, a ripple on the pool of our existence, a reflection of what we are all living through.
038073186X|5.0|Working at a store that sells mainly best sellers and older books written by those same authors, I have a really odd way of picking out what books to follow through with and read. What I was looking for in Shutter Island was for a psychotic Rachel Solando to be lurking in the shadows, making bodies turn up and clues slowly appear, but instead, I found a delightful, less brutal alternative that was more psychologically unsettling, which worked very well in this book.<br />Shutter Island has a dark feel through the pages, and between uncovering the secrets of Ashecliffe Hospital and figuring out how much Teddy Lehane's past affects his future will keep you flipping pages they're turning into flames after completion. Trying to figure out what is REALLY happening will have you reprimanding yourself constantly for being wrong, but don't worry, on the last few pages, I'm sure you'll figure it all out!<br />Great Psychological Thriller, great job, Dennis Lehane.<br />*also read Mystic River, another great one to check out
B0001MDQ6W|3.0|The CD of this performance did nothing for me, so the added dimension of watching this show does makes this set palatable, I guess.  It's kinda interesting to watch.  I just can't get excited about it because Dylan and the band don't seem too excited about it.  The energy level does start to pick up in the end somewhat, I think.  But there's a feeling of &quot;going through the motions&quot; here that is unfortunate.  And the set list leaves a lot to be desired.  John Brown and God on Our Side are interesting, I guess.  Dignity's kinda fun because it's not on an album, I guess.  Oh yawn, think I'll take a nap.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First of all, for those of you who are dissapointed with the new sound, you're not really fans if you can't accept experimentation. Personally, I've never been a fan of &quot;scream-metal&quot;; To me this change in sound is extremly welcomed, sure they are still heavy, but at least Corey sings more and there are more &quot;melodies&quot; in the newest release. The biggest surprise of all is that there are two acoustic songs, that was unexpected and I appluad them for trying new things with their music. If all you do is stick to the same mold you are just uncreative. Change/Experimenting is what set's true music away from pre-cut (insert false-music genre here). If you are a Slipknot fan and would like to hear them a little mellower, then deffinatly pick up Vol. 3.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's first, album, i thought was okay, but was more teen pop than rock. In this album, she really rocks out, with better songs with better lyrics than songs about s8er boi's. My favorite tracks on the album, to me is the first one, which really shows an edgy rock side of Avril, and my second favorite is Nobody's Home, and the tear-jerker on this album is Slipped Away, that makes me cry every time I listen to it. BUY THIS ALBUM!
6304233965|5.0|This video has two episodes that are highly ranked of my favorite episodes.  The seal is my second favorite.  BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006JSS8|5.0|This collection is awesome!!  Stevie Wonder's music remains timeless.  15 number 1 hits!!  Plus 6 more that reigned at the top of the charts!  Stevie Wonder's genius cannot be squashed into one CD but they did a GREAT job trying.  We all may have our favorites, some have been left out BUT 21 Stevie songs is nothing to complain about.  If you grew up with his music, this CD will transport you right back to that time, and leave you overjoyed.  A time when EVERYBODY knew all the words to EVERY song, because EVERY cut on the album was great.  If you were too young, you still won't be able to keep from groovin' to this CD.  Invite some friends &amp; family over.  Through the burgers on the grill.  Pop in this CD.  Feet can't help but move, heads will be boppin', as everyone relaxes to Stevie Wonder's heart and soul he put into his music.<br />Also, the CD insert is worth reading.  A good bit of trivia that they included was how each song rated on the R&amp;B, Pop and Adult Contemporary charts.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Git Up - pretty good, the rapping is all over the place and pretty random.<BR>Loyalty - one of the best beats on the CD. When you hear the first 10 seconds, you know that it's gonna be a great song. Very catchy.<BR>Just Like You - I don't like Bizarre, and this song is a good reason why. He talks and raps of sick stuff, this song really sucks.<BR>I'll Be Damned - I think D12 were high when they rapped this one. It sounds kind of goofy, but it's not bad.<BR>My Band - Very catchy. Eminem sounds off tone, but it works in this song.<BR>U R The One - This song is just average. Nothing great here.<BR>6 in the Morning - Another 5 star song. Awesome beat, good rapping.<BR>How Come - This song is amung the best. The lyrics are great to listen to, the beat almost sounds scary.<BR>Leave Dat Boy Alone - Meh.<BR>Get My Gun - A funny sort of song, great rapping, average beat. The chorus sucks.<BR>B**** - Good beat, average song overall.<BR>D12 World - I think of a circus when I hear this song. Creepy.<BR>40oz - BEST song on the cd. It's high energy, listen to it loud!<BR>American Psycho II - Beat (made by Dr. Dre) is top notch, the song is above average. Like, 8.5/10 stars.<BR>Good Die Young - Awesome. It's a sadder song, but leaves a great message. It's good to listen to.<BR>Keep Talkin - 5 star song here, good beat & raps.<br />All in all, 9 outta 10 stars. There's too many skits and filler to make the CD longer, but filter those out, and ignore Bizarre, and this is simply an awesome CD. Highly reccomended.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is a great album from a great band. Everything is great about it. There are no songs missing, or a song that should not have been there. Well, they could have included from their psychedelic days, but that is to be expected from agreatest hits compilation. This should be purchased by all means.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I have listen to many bands and know one can beat the Strokes. Influenced by the Velvet Underground and sounds just as good as them, if not better. Casablanca's voice is like Lou Reeds in The Modern Age. Every song is just like magic, two great singles are in this album, Last Night and Hard to Explain. With other great songs like The Modern Age and Soma and Is This it? Overall this album is great, 5 stars as well as their recent album Room On Fire. You can also listen to their songs and see music videos of them at [...]<br />Ps. When they come to town I recomendend grabbing tickets, even better live, you wont want to miss It.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|When this albu came out, I was a little skeptical that he would be good. But I bought it anyway. Enrique is one of the most talented performers to come out of the last decade. The lyrics are charming like You can run/You can hide/But you can't escape my love/. His old man, Julio, is not nearly as talented as his son. This is a must-have for fans of latin pop or just pop.
6305972591|2.0|yea yea yea its a cult classic and very memorable...but why...stephen king is an amazing writer, but this is weak...its not very suspensful, not very well acted, the score tho is probably the best ive ever heard from a horror movie, but the story line is slow and at times very boring.  And a lot of the characters are really annoying i mean, they make you want to take a gun to your TV annoying! Isaac, i wanted to slaughter that high pitched, midget friend of Dorothy, always complaining and going on! and malachae or w/e his name is...the dood with the red mullet and horse jaw....he annoyed me more than isaac...and whats with the stupid ending? the visual looks sooooo bad and soooo stupid! this movie as a whole just makes me mad....ok im changing the rating from a 3 to a 2.  Only reasons its getting 2 stars is cuz the music is awesome and its by stephen king....other than that...its not worth it
B00000JLWW|5.0|Finally, a remake better than the original. The oringinal Titanic was a 1953 flick with that Clifton Web dude in it. Definitely not worth my while. But then I decided to go see this movie when it came out. I could see why it became the highest-grossing film ever to be released. The story is great, so are the special effects. I cannmot believe Leonarndo DiCaprio nor Kate Hudson won an Academy Award for their roles. Pathetic. This is the best movie to be made. Ever.
B000089RVR|4.0|Untill you see Dido live, you might think that her songs are a bit too much alike.  I certainly did... then I saw her live.  Her voice is MUCH stronger and robust than her CDs and videos would lead you to believe, and she touched up her songs to make for an entertaining evening, well worth the price of admission.  I already owned \\"No Angel\\" when I went to the concert, but was holding off on \\"Life For Rent\\".  Now I own both, and am happy with the decision.<br />Can she come out with a third album with a similar sound and be successful?  I doubt it, but I would have said the same thing after \\"No Angel\\".  Florian certainly surpsied me.  She is a rarity nowadays - a singer who writes her own music, and that certainly speaks high of her artistic talent.  Writing lasting music is so much more difficult than flashing a boob or shimmying on stage to sell records.
0312995423|1.0|I read the Da Vinci Code, which in my opinion was a work of art.<BR>After I read that, I was hungry for more. So I got this. But this is atrocious. It is worse than anything Iv'e read in a long time. It lacks the thrilling sensation that the Da Vinci Code gave me, it was just too mainstream for my tastes. Also, I could do without all the violence. This book is simply awful. It is not worth anyone's time or money. Read the Da Vinci Code, but stay far away from this atrocity.
B00005JMSE|2.0|The only reason to watch this movie is to marvel at the enormous magnitude of Ron's Chin.  His only rival is the guy from Tango and Cash who has the Super Chin.  This movie would have done alot better if they cast the Super Chin as Ron's sidekick or if they would have just renamed the movie to Hellchin.
B000056JYC|4.0|If you love that talk-box sound that can be heard on some guitars, this is the album for ya. Frampton is the ultimate guitar master, talk-boxing and singing at the same time. This special edition is cool, but I would reccomend the original for moral reasons. Frampton's voice is cool, as well as all the keyboards. If you are sick and tired of artists like Josh Groban who give no soul whatsoever, this is the album for you.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|First off, I'm don't usually listen to pop music, however, my girlfriend is a Avril Lavingne fan, so I figured I'd give Avril a chance...and I'm glad I did. Her first album..'Let Go', was too pop for me...Under My Skin is more Rock. Here's my track by track rundown..<br />Take Me Away-5/5..short and rockin...kinda sounds like Amy Lee of Evanescence mixed with some Nickleback..good kick off song<br />Together-5/5..The chorus is great and so are the lyrics..Avril's really matured as a writer<br />Don't Tell Me-5/5..Great 1st singe..not as catchy as Complicated..but this song and Complicated are two completly different sounding songs...this the better of the two. The messege(saying no to sex and having your partner respect that) is important..and (sorry for sounding like a pig) the video is great because she's in her underwear...and she looks very good in them<br />He Wasn't-5/5...the lyrics are kinda dumb...but it's fast and up-tempo..reminds me of skater boi<br />How Does It Feel-2/5..For some reason, I don't care for this song..I just feel that she's trying to write another I'm with you..and if this is it...she failed<br />My Happy Ending-5/5...The 2nd single..one of the best on the album..the peope that  got into Avril when Complicated came out will dig this song...the lyrics are great..and her voice is great<br />Nobody's Home-5/5....a very slow song with fast choruses...great lyrics again<br />Forgotten..4/5....the chorus is the only thing that nets this song 5/5<br />Who Knows-5/5..Avril rocks out on this one...the messege of the song is good..live every day like it's your last<br />Fall to Pieces-5/5....kinda sounds like a Michelle Branch song...which is fine..but Avril's trademark bratty tone makes it better<br />Freak Out-1/5..I hate this song...everything about it..this is merely filler<br />Slipped Away-5/5..about her grandfather that died...is moving and will be a sure fire hit if she releases it as a single...great for slow dances at prom too<br />So in conclusion...if you like Avril's frist album..you may be surprised..as this one is heavier and more real soundin..but any true music fan can appreciate what talent Avril posseses and hopefully, she be making music years from now
B00003CXB4|1.0|The reviewer Offensive Donkey was completely right. This is VERY overrated. We thought this was going to be SO great. But it isn't. It is vulgar, coarse, and filled with awful songs. Who made this a musical. If you want a good cartoon, go watch Porky Pig. You are better off watching some cheesy Fred Astaire movie than this. Lemme give you the pathetic story: A horribly irritating young lion cub is driven away by some overly evil uncle. Then he returns as a square adult with the help of his two obnoxious friends and his egotistic girlfriend. He drives the evil king away. But who made this a musical? The songs are horrible. I'm sure they were okay when Elton John sang them , but no! Some silly woman is singing them, botching them up in the process. This is truly a band movie and ought to be banned.
0684803356|5.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book with large themes: war, love, devotion to duty, and the clash between modern, rational values and more traditional ones.  At a higher level, it is about connections between people: indeed, the book opens with the following quotation from John Donne:<br />. . . any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. <br />Hemingway takes us inside a guerilla band during the Spanish Civil War, mostly through the eyes of Robert Jordan, an American professor-cum-demolitions expert.  Jordan is a Communist - at least he is strongly drawn to Communism - who has come to Spain to fight fascism.  He has character and a sense of duty.  Since, from our vantage point, at the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that not many people do, this gives the book a kind of \\"long ago and far away\\" feel.  Readers in 1940, when the book was published, no doubt experienced it in a more immediate way.<br />This book includes many memorable secondary characters: among them Pilar, the wise leader of the band of partisans, Pablo, her drunken, amoral, but capable husband, and Maria, the love interest in the story.  <br />Like every Hemingway novel that I've read, this one is well written.  Hemingway uses the archaic English \\"thou\\" for the Spanish \\"tu\\" and translates literally from Spanish to English to better convey an impression of Spanish dialogue to English readers.  These devices are initially distracting but are actually very successful at taking the reader inside the minds of the Spanish-speaking characters in this book.<br />This is a distinguished work and an exciting one.  It deserves its acclaim.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This album is pathetic. Why on earth does a young guy like that wanna make opera music. At least he could make cheesy pop. That would be better than this. I don't understand how any young, American (i think he's Amarican) guy would wanna make this kind of music. How dare he! This is the worst music I have heard in a long time. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.
B0001Z3TS4|4.0|This collection of 5 DVDs contains 20 episodes from the 1954-1955 TV series.  I personally like this TV series.  Ronald Howard is more personable than most others who have played Sherlock Holmes - more human - but still quirky and particular.  In this series, he seems to enjoy being smarter than the other characters, but he does it with more of a sense of humor, rather then being obnoxious about it.  Like any TV series, some episodes are better than others, but I found them all enjoyable.  The episodes contained in this collection are:<br />Disk 1<BR>-Laughing Mummy<BR>-Texas Cowgirl<BR>-Perfect Husband<BR>-Reluctant Carpenter<br />Disk 2<BR>-Shoeless Engineer<BR>-Singing Violin<BR>-Royal Murder<BR>-Shy Ballerina<br />Disk 3<BR>-Tyrant's Daughter<BR>-Thistle Killer<BR>-Pennsylvania Gun<BR>-Baker Street Bachelors<br />Disk 4<BR>-Neurotic Detective<BR>-Red-Headed League<BR>-Vanished Detective<BR>-Night Train Riddle<br />Disk 5<BR>-Eiffel Tower<BR>-Jolly Hangman<BR>-Cunningham Heritage<BR>-Diamond Tooth<br />The last 10 episodes of this collection (as listed above) were previously released by Madacy in a 2-disk set (ASIN B00006FDAB).
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Hard rock was one of the dying genres in the past decade. Except for bands like STP, there were absolutely no good hard rock/metal bands. Until Jet came along. Jet is a four piece hard rock outfit from the land of the down under. They play loud, raw, hard rock n roll in the style of AC/DC and The Black Crowes. This is the best hard rock band to hit the circuit since Nirvana. Any fan of hard rock, heavy metal, garage rock, classic rock, and even oldies should get this album, because the band mixes all of those styles.
B000002H1T|5.0|By 1984, the Cars had already recorded four albums, producing a respectable string of hits during the early 80's.  &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; bought the group to it's peak with an album that produced no less then five Billboard Hits during the 1984-1985 period.  These included &quot;you might think&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;heartbeat city&quot; and the Benjamin Orr ballad, &quot;Drive&quot;.  The album comes across well with a consistent mid-eighties dance feel.  Other tracks that complimented the album was &quot;Why can't I have You&quot;, a song which had great charting potential, and the other tracks, &quot;looking for love&quot;, &quot;Stranger eyes&quot;, &quot;it's not the night&quot;, and  &quot;I refuse&quot;.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|When i first bought this album i was alittle thrown off by how much they've toned down since their debut release but after listening to the cd a few times it really started to grow on me, i like how they show us more of their talents when it comes to guitars and drums. so this cd is almost nothing like the first but in my opinion is still better then iowa. this is a good cd, if ur like 1 of those big hardcore fans that only like the &quot;old&quot; slipknot just remember its impossible to recapture or recreate what they once had, i would be personally disappointed if they tried, cause that would just be a desperate attempt to relive what they've already made.<BR>but anyway back to this cd, its a great cd with awesome lyrics, crushing guitar riffs, and mind blowing drums, so any self respecting person should buy this album
B000031WI8|4.0|This is one of those CDs that gets a good playing at my place.  It has all the tracks that made this UK pop outfit huge through out the 1980's.  <br />Formed in 1981, The original line up of Wham included George Michael, Andrew Ridgeley and backing vocals from Pepsi and Shirley.  <br />Their first Australian hit was &quot;the Wham Rap&quot; which debuted in Christmas 1982.  Their awesome chain of hits continued with Young guns, Bad boys, Wake me up, Careless Whisper, Freedom, Everything she wants, I'm your man, Where did your heart go and the edge of heaven.  <br />Yepppp!!!  I'm a die hard WHAM! fan.  There has been some other wham compilations released since this one,  None of them come close to the great selection of tracks on this one.  <br />Only small picking bone with this album is the drawn out version of &quot;last christmas&quot;.  Would of preferred the original radio mix, hense the four star rating.
B000060P79|1.0|Why are people always grouping this band with Good Charlotte? Honestly, they are NOTHING alike! Good Charlotte's lyrics are more personal and sincere, this band's lyrics are fake and just stupid. Listen to this lyric by Simple Plan: &quot;Now its Chriiiiistmaaaaas and I want everything I just can't waaaiiit&quot;, now here's a Good Charlotte lyric: &quot;Hard days made me, hard nights shaped me, I dont know they somehow saved me, and I know I'm making something out of this life they call nothing&quot;. See the difference? Plus, Good Charlotte have charted on Modern Rock charts 5 times, Simple Plan has never even been played on rock stations.
B000148KK2|5.0|Diana Krall continuous her good works.  It is different from her pass work only in style.  The quality has improved.  It is a bit darker but also somewhat lifting.  I most definitely enjoyed her songs.  It takes a while longer but if you take the time.  It is very very good.
B0002234LS|4.0|Great movie, I also recommend the book or novella too. Read it, really good. I enjoyed it, it had a nice twist to it, suspenseful! A must see if you are a Johnny Depp fan, but of course you would have already seen it. :)
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under My Skin rocks the house!!!!!  I absolutely love it!!!!  It has been in my CD player since the day it was released.  Each song has lots of edge and has a darker tone.  Also, they are very catchy and I can't stop listening to them.  It shows a more mature side of Avril, lyric wise and vocal.  She is talented beyond her years and definitely proved herself as an artist with this album.  It's truly her best work to date and I will always love her music and have much respect for her.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Let Go.  You will not be disappointed.  Avril is the best!!!!!!!  Rock on!  :)
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I think it is funny... she wears &quot;punk&quot;... but her make-up and hair were done by the same people who did Paris Hilton's make-up. Then, the first &quot;single&quot; is the slowest &quot;punk&quot; song ever. But worst of all... those &quot;deep deep&quot; lyrics she uses to paint us such a vivid picture of how she made-out with a guy and he &quot;hurt me&quot;. Using a list of words from her vocabulary: This CD is not good. It is very not good. It is so not good it is bad. Save yourself the money and buy something that will move you!
B0001UL7RY|3.0|This album is clearly a step below \\"Let Go.\\" Her voice has matured in two years, which is good, but her lyric writing is still juvenile; in short, she has the vocabulary of a 12 year old. If I knew her address I'd mail her some John Steinbeck or Jack London. Read some fiction, Avril!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The final entry in the Matrix trilogy will disappoint some - probably many of those who weren't hardcore Matrix fans.  Picking up where the last movie left off (and I'm not going to regale you with what the Matrix is about, because if you haven't seen either of the other movies, you really have no business watching \\"Revolutions\\"), the humans' hidden city of Zion faces certain annihilation by the \\"Machine Army\\".  <br />(Okay - in a distant future, a civilization of intelligent machines enslaves almost all humanity, using human bio-energy to power themselves; the unfortunate humans who are born and ultimately die while tapped by the machines remain oblivious to their fate because their consciousness remains trapped in a vast virtual reality known as \\"The Matrix\\"; the first flick taught us how existence their was split between the consciousness  of those imprisoned there and AI programs who kept order; \\"Reloaded\\" added an interesting spin - rather than just an Us (humans) against them (Machines outside the Matrix and AI programs on the inside) AI programs were depicted as sophisticated, able to mathematically deduce what were seemingly human feelings of love, lust, frustration, dissension and regret.  We met the Merovingian - an almost god-like program who reconstructed himself as a Francophiliac philosopher of free choice; the \\"Keymaker\\" an obsolete program who doesn't let his impending destruction keep him from making keys for doors meant to remain locked, and pointing the way for those lost; we also found out that the enigmatic \\"Oracle\\" was herself a high-level program; and we finally met the architect himself.  Rather then merely single-mindedly enslave and exploit us, these bits of heavyweight AI waxed with surprising intelligence on free choice.<br />At the end of the last movie, Neo (Reeves) learned from the Architect that he was not destined by fate to save mankind from the machines - but actually chosen by the machines to fulfill his role in their order in which Zion is repeatedly created and then destroyed (the machines, being essentially equation-crunching computers, thrive on predictable patterns;  it's our free choice, not just our freedom, that sets us apart from the machines).  Though the machines are assured of their victory over the humans, they've got problems of their own - namely the AI program Agent Smith (Weaving).  Once only a cog in the Matrix whom we thought destroyed by Neo in \\"The Matrix\\", we learnt in \\"Reloaded\\" that only his connection to the AI was destroyed, but Smith himself not only remained in existence, but found the power to turn others in the Matrix into clones of himself.  By the end of \\"Reloaded\\", Smith was able to make the biggest jump of all - cloning himself onto one of Zion's agents and leaping into the next world in the body of a human.  In \\"Revolutions\\", the humans face an awesome attack by the machines.  Neo and Trinity fight to reach the main AI at the center of the machines' city while Morpheus and Niobe race time and a fleet of the Machines' sentinels to reach their own.  Meanwhile, within the Matrix itself, Smith consolidates his power by cloning everything into himself.<br />\\"Revolutions\\" is very much a mixed bag - the metaphysics and plotlines developed in the first two movies are not entirely served by the comparatively abrupt ending.  Also, the plot separates characters who should remain together - Trinity joins Neo on his futile journey to the machines because that plays up the romance angle of the flick, but shouldn't it be Morpheus who goes along?  (Before Trinity fell in love with Neo, it was Morpheus who believed in him, and it was Morpheus's faith that was shattered at the end of \\"Reloaded\\" - what better way, in a story about predestination and free-choice, to develop a character than by showing it acting first on perceived fate, then by free-choice?  So Trinity and Neo have their romantic moment while Morpheus &amp; Niobe are nearly drowned by clouds of CGI-rendered Sentinels).  That aside, \\"Revolutions\\" is still an adrenaline-soaked feast for the eyes, one that pushes the boundaries of what you can show, even in wide-screen format.  The climactic attack on Zion - in which humans battle clouds of sentinels, and mammoth drill robots, easily outstrips the lame all-CGI battles of the last \\"Star Wars\\" movies (it's sort of a mix between \\"Starship Troopers\\" and Tolkein).  For a CGI fest, \\"Revolutions\\" leans heavily on some very human FX - Morpheus is still loveable for his pseudo-zen koans, while Hugo Weaving's deadpan delivery will keep him as cinema's most chillingly convincing manifestation of artificial intelligence.  Also, special kudos to Ian Bliss, a human who becomes Smith's vessel in the \\"real\\" world, and gives us all a valuable how-to-sound-like-Hugo Weaving lesson.  If you want a nice and tidy story, go watch \\"Star Trek\\".  For a more complicated ride, plug into the Matrix.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|OK, this will teach me to buy a CD based on the 2 or 3 songs I hear on the radio.  After &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot; and &quot;cold hard b*tch&quot; and a few seconds of a couple of the other songs, I though, &quot;cool!&quot;  After listening to the entire CD, however, I can tell you that the 2 above mentioned songs may be the high point of the CD, while the other tracks will likely get skipped over more often than not.If you are so inclined to buy this CD, catch it used and save yourself a few bucks.  There is better music out there.
B0000541AM|4.0|It's hard to imagine it now but when The Warriors first came out in '79 it was hugely controversial. Some theaters refused to show the movie because they feared arson and gang activity. Others were afraid that it might give disaffected teens crazy ideas but the word of mouth on the movie was so strong people just had to see it. <br />Okay, it's got some flaws. Most gangs weren't muliracial back then and they certainly aren't now. NYC is a tough town but even back in the 70s it wasn't the absolute hell hole depicted in the movie and since when do gangs get their marching orders from thelocal radio stations? <br />Those are just tiny quibbles. Sit back and enjoy. Michael Beck played the role of his career as Swan, the leader of the Warriors a small Coney Island gang who head way up town to attend the city's biggest gang summit. Cyrus (Can you dig it?) wants to put aside petty differences and form one big super gang but he's cut down but a vicious and annoying little weasel who blames Swan's gang for the killing. The rest of the movie has the Warriors trying to get home. They run for their lives through what looks like miles of empty(!) New York streets pursued by every gang, large, small and minor league in town. <br />At one point the trip started reminding me of Odyseus coming home from Troy. They run into one danger after another including two traps in the forms of females. Ajax, like the Greek fighter from Troy is strong, brave but dumber than a box of rocks and he blunders into one of the biggest surprises of the night. Other members of the group run into a group of cute girls and go merrily to a party that almost turns out the be their last and Swan, like Odyseus ends up with his own version of the ever faithful Penelope.<br />I was 10 when I saw the Warriors and came away with a couple of useful tidbits :<BR>1. Don't take the subway. There's a war zone down there.<BR>2. If you see a guy in a heavy makeup and a baseball uniform at midnight, run for your life. <BR>3. Listen to the radio. They might be talking about you.<BR>4. On big gang movement nights the citizens of New York go to bed early and don't come out again until the next morning to clean up the bodies.<BR>5. That red spot in the sand really is blood.  <br />The Warriors is funny, a little sad and still after all these years it's the movie equivalent of an amusement park ride. It's not War & Peace but it is a cult classic and once you watch it if you have any kind of sense of humor you'll really dig it.
0062502182|5.0|I've probably read this book over a dozen times and know exactly what happens in the story. Yet each time I pick up this book, I can't bare to put it down until I have reached the end. This book is an inspirational read which never gets old and upon really reading it, you realize that it's a lot deeper than just the story in itself.<br />After reading this book, I've become a huge fan of Paulo Coelho's books. I've now read over 6 of his books and this one is by far his best work.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|A great album of 70s influenced music for people who weren't alive in the 70s, and for people who were.  While nearly every track on this one is amazing, &quot;Sunshine&quot; &quot;Under Your Charms&quot; and &quot;Rise&quot; are the highlights.  I do have some faults with this album, &quot;Slaveship&quot; is goofy and non-sensical, and his lyrics are not as strong as on Under Cold Blue Stars.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone who enjoys great music.  Keep up the good work Josh!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Reading many of these reviews made me laugh, and also realize why I never read the customer reviews before buying music!<br />First off, I agree, I couldn't care less if she is a punk or not. Saying \\"I don't like it because she is/isn't a punk\\" is ridiculous. It's like saying, \\"I don't like it because it's written by a girl.\\" The latter, everyone would say is sexist, so why is the first ok? She could have a blue mohawk for all I care, the music is what matters to me. I'm not buying a photo album of her, I'm buying a music CD. And, I like the music. Judging it on other things is just prejudice. Who cares what her shirt says? If the music is good, that's why I buy it. Not because I think the shirt she is wearing looks nice.<br />As for the person who said get No Doubt instead, I prefer music where people actually play instruments. Not where everything is done on a synthesizer. I like to hear real guitars, and real drums, not someone pressing keys on a keyboard. I have nothing against No Doubt, but I prefer listening to music that sounds good *without* having most of the accompanyment done by a computer.<br />If you liked Let Go, you'll like this album as well. I personally liked every song on the CD.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Everything about this album screams perfection.  From the catchy yet complex lyrics about love and lust to the tight musicianship by the Attractions.  Mr. Costello wears his heart on his sleeve with every note that he sings.<br />  <BR>     There is not one weak track here, in fact they are all perfect in every way.  I kid you not.  I suppose that if I had to pick highlights they would be &quot;(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; and &quot;Radio, Radio.&quot; With this record alone, Mr. Costello proves that he deserves to be hailed by some critics as one of the best recording artists of all time.  And the fact that it only took him a matter of months to do this?  Mind-boggling indeed.
0062502182|5.0|This is the type of book that should be required reading somewhere during one's life.  I imagine it isn't because it's the type of book that finds you when you're ready to read it. It captivates you and has you pondering your own life with each page of the journey.  It's so universal and appealing that it becomes irresistible. That it's so brief and easy to read is a bonus. You WILL read it again.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Our society has lost a great deal, with its sex revolutions, and easy, or nonexistent manners.  Wrap yourself, for a brief respite, in a genteel society. Experience the romantic allurement of beautiful clothing. Watch the graceful, dignified dances and parties where courtship had a chance to grow slowly, and perhaps more solidly. Follow Emma's match-making mistakes and failures, when she doesn't know her own mind. I yearned for more of Jeremy Northam, and especially his dancing.  This man is beautiful to see.  As well, Ms. Paltrow was always captivating.
B000002UA0|3.0|There seems to be a lot of nostalgia for this the early works of Pink Floyd. Piper of the Gates of Dawn is really Syd Barrett's vision, and a psychedelic one at that. There is a lot of nonsense written about this guy in the music press. The reality is he was too unstable, and was simply replaced by Dave Gilmour, and the creative force behind the band became his partnership with Roger Waters. They went on to produce some great records: Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. For me they started to get repetitive at The Wall, and later albums lack the quality that was present in the 70s. Forget the 60s offerings, Piper is a lukewarm interesting album, but really only for those who want every album Floyd ever produced. If you buy this expecting a forgotten masterpiece you will be disappointed. Just being honest!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Some people complain that they will not be getting the original versions of the film.  There are also rumors of further enhancements and additions beyond the Special Editions.  I say it is great to finally get these wonderful films on DVD with or without the enhancenents.  The other versions have been available for years on VHS and I am of the opinion that any new material presented is a good thing.  It also gives you a reason to keep your old VHS tapes.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Alright all you dumb Avril haters, I wanna know why the hell u waste your time here then!! Ive read some of the reviews and all those who dissed her, need to get a LIFE. She's SOOO good that she made u come here and write about her OK !! whether it was a diss or not, u're using time and effort to write about AVRIL LAVIGNE.. so just admit it, she's freakin AMAZING !! <br />The album is an EXCELLENT followup to Let Go and i think she did an amazing job. I do agree that the songs more like grow on to you and i loved them all. If ure reading this and u're still not sure, BUY IT NOW !!!!!
B00005JK8K|1.0|This DVD is not widescreen . And I need all my DVDs widescreen because  I have a windscreen TV. Went to Hasting all of Windtalkers DVD are both widescreen and  Fullscreen.<BR>And I went back to my order from  you   and it show it was widescreen that was order.<BR>What happen?
B00000IGGA|5.0|After reading multiple reviews on this site, most of the reviewers have it right, 4 or 5 stars.  What is interesting is that people get hung up on having their favorite artists do things only one way.<br />For instance, those that may have started with Waits during his younger years, may only appreciate his talking, rambling, discovered stories.  Others that jumped on midway may only appreciate his \\"found\\" experimental sounds (Bone Machine anyone?).  However, this is yet another rung in the Tom Waits evolution.<br />Those that dismissed this disc must be very narrow in their likes.  Only country, only rap, etc.  To pigeonhole Mr. Waits into only one type of music that he is \\"good\\" at is very disappointing.  For those calling this his \\"swan song\\" or recommending to \\"skip it\\", you are really missing out.  What a great combination of lyrics, vocals, and sounds.  It works.  It must to have been nominated and won the (grammy?) for best folk record that year.<br />Hey, skip it if you don't want to hear something good.  Sure, you need to pick up Nighthawk's at the Diner, Bone Machine, and many of the others as well.  This is well worth the $$$.  Go for the import if you want the complete disc, or download the free MP3's off of amazon to complete it (Buzz Fledderjohn and Big Face Money).
B000003TA4|5.0|I can't begin to describe how Nirvana and Kurdt make me feel inside. When I hear his voice, it makes me and all of my heartbreaking teenage issues melt away into oblivian. I worship him. I know, it's a little weird, with me being male and all, but I just think he's a dreamboat. His grungy persona is so all-consuming that his voice on all of these Nevermind pop songs has saved me from ending it all more times than I could count. That's right, as selfish as Kurdt was, with his embracing his money and alienating his fans, has kept me alive and breathing. Strangely, his ending his life has kept me alive, because it proves he made the ultimate, most soul-searching sacrifice any human being could choose to make for me. Soul-drenched fancypop scream-alongs like Lithium and Endless Nameless really let you get to know to real Kurdt and how his addiction made him a savior to us everywhere. He was so cool. When I feel I am at my darkest hour, about to pull the trig, the voice in my brain remembers how Kurdt did it for me so I don't have to. I just remember the soothing meloncholia of Drain You, and my soul floats on the same clouds Kurdt's did when he was having hangovers. I am now a true poet. Thank You, Kurdt D. Kobane. <br />1964-1995<BR>R.I.P. (+_+)
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby is more than a genius of techno, he is a genius of music. What he does in this album is so joyful and depressing simultaneously, I just want to listen to it over and over again. The best tracks are Porcelain, Why does my heart feel so bad?, Southside, Natural Blues, and Run On. And the rest are still amazing songs.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I can't stand this this girl. She has zero respect for anyone over her age, anyone from certain social backgrounds she doesn't like, and anyone who has the right mind to tell her what she needs to hear (mainly that she's a little b*tch that needs to give the fake &quot;punk girl&quot; facade a rest). It so funny to see her on the tele, because whenever she makes an appearance, she's always good for a laugh. It's so obvious she's putting on a front. Somebody really needs to tell her off. I bet she'd either run off crying and/or end up getting smacked upside her noggin for giving somebody the finger. She's like one of those bullies we've all encountered in middle or high school; she tears you down for not being like her, and yet she still says she's &quot;an individual&quot;. Yeah, and individual like everyone else. I find it horrible that Avril alienates her fans and makes them conform to the way she dresses and acts. Because, after all, if you aren't like Avril, you aren't &quot;cool enough&quot; to be her fan. What an awful message to send to her young listeners. When her main audience is younger pre-teen girls, I'm sure it's a hard blow to their self image when they find out they have to compromise their own identity to be her fan. I suggest bypassing Avril altogether, not being her fan at all, and going for some music that you can groove to and be yourself with.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd is great!! Slipknot is still the same old angry Slipknot, just with a few changes. They have a couple of slow songs and they don't cuss in this cd. OHHHH NOOOO!!!! If you don't like Slipknot now because of this, then you are a peice of rotting feces, but i see a lot of people agree that this cd rocks
B000000WJZ|5.0|I must say that Billy Corgan has mastered rock perfection with Siamese Dream. My thr33 best faves on the CD are Today, Starfishf*#k, and Mayonaise Boy. It is totally a disk of pure, unadulterated grunge-stylings. Look out for Melloncholly and the Finite Neverending Sad album too. I give Siamese Dream my highest marks ever!<br />Peace out.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With almost a thousand reviews, it's unlikely that many people will read this particular one. So let me just say that I recommend this science fiction western very highly.
0792107683|1.0|If this is the best western ever, then it's a pretty sorry genre. Might as well get the few good points covered first--the scenery, the fights, a couple of scenes that manage a bit of convincing realism--the funeral (despite the corny sentimentality of the dog pawing the coffin), the attempt at some depth of character in the bad-guy rancher about halfway through the movie. That's about it. As for the badd, shall we start with Ladd? He and all the actors talk like they're in a semi-coma. Was this a borrowing from the 50's fad for method acting? And how in the world could that dull little kid have been nominated for an oscar??? Jean Arthur was 50+ and her sqwuaky voice betrays her age, not to mention that awful wig she's wearing (I hope it is a wig!) The subtext of the movie seems to be a case of man/boy love between Ladd and DeWilde (interesting name) and if viewed that way is at least worth a few laughs. Horrible music (loved the borrowing from Stravinsky's Rite of Spring as Shane rides into town at the end!) that tries to manipulate our emotions, stereotypes everywhere, everywhere. Oh, why bother? It's awful, dreadful, miserable. The &quot;lowdown Yankee liar&quot; line put the final nail in the coffin, the last piece of lead in the gunslinger for this hater of westerns generally and this one specifically.
078681859X|5.0|\\"The sulphur cloud contracted into a thick column of smoke that vomited forth thin tendrils  ... There was a barely perceptible pause. Then two yellow staring eyes materialized in the heart of the smoke.<br />Hey, it was his first time. I wanted to scare him.\\"<br />The 5,000-year-old djinni Bartimaeus resents being under the power of human magicians, especially when the one who summons him is a mere stripling of a boy. Bartimaeus expects to have to do nothing more taxing than a few simple illusions for Nathaniel But Nathaniel has talent way beyond his years and has something considerably more dangerous in mind: revenge against a magician who made him look a fool. Nathaniel sends Bartimaeus off to steal the powerful Amulet of Samarkand from Simon Lovelace, a master magician of unrivalled ruthlessness and ambition who will do ANYTHING to achieve his ends. And so both djinni and apprentice boy wizard are soon caught up in a terrifying flood of magical intrigue, murder and rebellion that makes for a thrilling read for fantasy-lovers of all ages.<br />The excerpt starting this review comes on the second page, and the whole of the first page is descriptive, much like the first paragraph of the excerpt, so it's only when you read the last sentence that you realise this is a first-person account. It's an electrifying introduction to Bartimaeus and sets the scene for the hair-raising and hilarious things that will occur whenever the djinni is around.<br />However, when the story moves to Nathaniel's viewpoint, Jonathan Stroud wisely adopts third person rather than trying to imitate the language of a modern young teenager. I found the change a little disconcerting at first but soon became comfortable with it. Sometimes when Stroud makes a switch in viewpoint readers are returned to the beginning of the scene they have just read, which makes for some fascinating contrasts. It's also probably why the book is rather long, though it never seems so.<br />The Amulet of Samarkand is a stunning read (it knocks any of the Harry Potter books into a cocked hat) and I can't wait to meet Bartimaeus again. He, rather than young Nathaniel, is the \\"star\\" of Stroud's story.a stunning read (it knocks any of the Harry Potter books into a cocked hat) and I can't wait to meet Bartimaeus again.

B00000AFFI|5.0|Although my personal favorite will probably always be &quot;Four Track Demos,&quot; I consider &quot;Is This Desire&quot; to be her best work.  It's a departure from the gritty rough PJ Harvey of &quot;Rid of Me&quot; and &quot;Dry&quot; fame.  In my opinion it continues on the maturity and evolution that starting showing itself on &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;.  Don't get me wrong there is still some grit on this album but it's much more subdued than balls on approach of her earlier work.  I'd consider this album a perfect introduction to PJ Harvey for non fans and a classic for fans.
B000021Y7X|5.0|David Byrne self-interviews himself nice.  It's good to feel nice.  You laugh.  The video will make you good to feel nice...and then cry.  Because you feel video to feel nice.  Does anybody have any questions?  I have a tape to play for you...To feel nice. Do you know what I'm trying to say?  Thanks, Toe Knee
0800141849|2.0|Eight years after watching this film in its original theatrical run, I am sad to say that THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES has not aged well.  While its always a delight to see Streisand display her expert comic timing, this film is simply laden with the star's own vain notions and ramblings regarding true love and beauty and its &quot;two faces&quot;.   While the premise is interesting, the rest of the film rambles on as if Streisand herself wasn't entirely sure what her conclusions were to be.  What does not help the process along is the final half hour's blatant &quot;Hello gorgeous!&quot; antics Streisand perpetuates ad nauseum.  Its derivitive and vain and frankly quite dull.<BR>Saving the picture are the wonderful performances by the supporting cast.  Brenda Vacarro is given little screen time as Rose's pal who is &quot;in the same boat&quot; when it comes to beauty.  Austin Pendleton and George Segal are a delight to watch (both of whom worked with Streisand in pictures in the early 70s).  Last but not least is Lauren Bacall, who adds a wonderful teaspoon of vinegar to the portrayal of the seemingly vain mother (who ends up actually having a heart of gold).<BR>If you can get past the &quot;Streisand Vanity&quot; which plagues this movie, then perhaps you will be in for an enjoyable viewing.
B00013RC9I|5.0|Air can s**t on a piece of plastic and sell it and I will still buy it and rave about it.  Personally, I think that Air keeps on getting better.  When I first bought this album I was not totally happy with it (it had to compete with two awesome predecessors)until maybe 10 listens later, it became the greatest thing since baguettes and brie.  Now its almost a daily staple to my musical diet.  Ive turned on so many to Air and continue to do so today.  This album seems to be melodic, filled with diverse and catchy tunes.  All the songs are good.  If you ever get the chance to see them live DO SO!!  I also love their music videos which are artistic and edgy.  Believe me I would not have written this review unless I SERIOUSLY did approve of this album!
B000000IRK|5.0|I love &quot;Tommy&quot; for all its incredible melodies, deep insights, challenging format, and stunning production. The concept of the album was beyond even what the Beatles were doing in that it was not just held together by a theme. &quot;Tommy&quot; was an attempt to probe the psychology of a traumatized boy and his family, and the sick, exploitative culture that we are all (still) embedded in. That being said, it simply rocks!!! I had the Gold CD version and dumped it because the version of Eyesight to the Blind features an alternate vocal that lacks the intensity of the original. Here, instead of hitting the notes hard and high, Daltrey is singing them an octave lower with a more pensive approach.  Well, nobody beats Roger for sphincter-tightening screams, so I went for the orginal/remastered version. I will probably get the newer, Deluxe 2-disc edition just for completeness' sake, and because the Who have done a fantastic job with that entire series, putting other icons (such as the Stones) to shame when it comes to class reissues. (Beatle industry--are you paying attention?) So, don't go for the gold on &quot;Tommy&quot;, just go for what was great in the first place.
B00005NKKY|1.0|Paul Simon said in an interview in the early seventies that each of the five Simon and Garfunkel albums was better than the one that preceeded it, and I think this assessment accurate, so much so, in fact, that I can't conceive of a reasonable person disputing it. The original &quot;Bookends&quot; had some very good songs, &quot;America&quot;, for example, some so-so songs, &quot;Faking It&quot;, and some sludge, &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot;, for example. It was superior to &quot;Parsely, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme&quot; (less pretentious, pseudo-poetic, and precious), and inferior to the truly inspired &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot;.  <br />But that was the original version. This thing here includes two superfluous tracks. If you don't want your listening experience ruined, you have either to run over to your CD player just before it gets to them or else laboriously program them out every time you listen. <br />&quot;You Don't Where Your Interest Lies&quot; is worth hearing for Simon and Garfunkel historians once and only once. It's a throw-away, but it's interesting that it sounds like the period. I can't imagine, on the other hand, who would want to hear the unfinished demo-tape version of &quot;Old Friends&quot; even once. What's it doing here? Presumably, it's here to trick you into thinking you're getting more for your money, but is anyone really that stupid? You're getting LESS for your money; you're getting a greatly compromised version of &quot;Bookends&quot;.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|As stated above, these two songs, tracks three and four, are very good.  Unfortunately, out of the other 9 songs on the cd, I would say that there are only maybe 3 or 4 that are above average.  I  first bought this cd because of comparisons to the Strokes, one of my favorite bands, and unfortunately was fairly dissapointed.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly can easily be considered one of the best westerns ever made because, like the other two &quot;Man with No Name&quot; movies, it broke all the rules. The wide open composition of Sergio Leone's cinematography, the harsh landscapes, the excellent characters, and Ennio Morricone's masterpiece score all make this add up to far more than just some spaghetti western. This expanded DVD edition proves interesting. The extra footage intergrates into the movie nicely, although you can easily tell that a lot of the dubwork was redone, because Eli Wallach does NOT sound like the Tuco of old in the several scenes he redubs. The extras on the second disc are interesting, but nothing really special. The extra commentary is nice, especially the commentary about Morricone's score. The ability to listen to the original Italian audio is also interesting. The package is handsomely presented with a booklet and several movie poster reproductions in various languages. Overall, this is a fitting tribute to one of the more excellent westerns ever made.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I'm a musician of roughly 9 years, and I play about 5 instruments.  Now that I appear credible to speak, I shall.  This album...is amazing!  It is much heavier than Let Go, and there are some new aspects aside from that that make it a wonderful journey through Avril's heartache (which is apparent from the lyrical content).  A lot of piano is used, as well as some 5-string bass, which makes the sound much deeper.  Her voice is doubled a lot more, as well as harmonized.  The end behaviour is almost a sqwaky sound at times.  I think it would be better if she could get some growl in her voice on a few tracks, but she's not like that, and that enforces her style.  Those are my only suggestions.  Otherwise her voice begins to sound more Irish on this album than on Let Go, where she really only touched base with that on one track.  It's a rad album!  If you're a fan of good, well written music, this will be one of the best purchases so far this year in music.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Honestly, I'm sick and tired of people who come on here just to diss Avril. So what if she claims she's punk or not? I thought music was about the lyrics and the melodies, not how you dress yourself. I couldn't care less what she looks like as long as her music sounds good to my ears. Plus, contrary to popular belief, she actually CAN sing. (If you need proof, watch her on SNL) Better than some bands whose singing is so horrendous they use loud raucous guitar rifts to drown it out. I just bought this CD, and not because I'm trying to stick to an image, but because I LIKE HER MUSIC. So I don't give a crap if she's not &quot;punk&quot; or not, because what exactly is it? If you like Avril or Michelle Branch or basic pop rock, you'll like this album, and if you don't like that type of music, then why are you even reading this review?
B0001UL7RY|4.0|OK so shes not a child prodidgy but she must be doing something right to sell this many CDs. This CD is a little bit more grown up than let go and i enjoyed it more. Especially songs like He wasnt and fall to pieces. Her music has strayed a little bit further from pop and into punk and to me that is a good thing. Avril isnt an artist that you should take too seriously but she is an artist that you can enjoy without having to feel guilty about selling your soul to pop or turning into some rock fan. Granted she may not be as original as she trys to make out but in the end she's still just a teenager who is growing up and needs to find her own market, not the one her record company sets out for her. Her career is just starting out, so maybe when shes a little older and wiser she'll make her own way and will finally become as 'original' as she claims to be, and maybe will be worthy of the success she has now. But until then Under my skin is a great CD with a variety of Pop punk music that will even have the avril haters singing along to the stereo : )
B0001NBMBC|5.0|If you want to hear &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Slipknot&quot; put them in your Cd player and play them. This is a different album, and I am glad Slipknot decided not to make the same album again. And that the guitar is more defined and melodic. Keep an open mind and buy this album and don't think Stone Sour because that is a whole other album and band altogether. And on the Jagermeister tour Slipknot was just as brutal as ever. Just in case you think I am a big mainstreem fan, about 75% of what I listen to is black metal so I listen to the extreem and think the old Slipknot was almost mild. But a good album is a good album you can't judge a band by its past work each album is like a different day.
B000000OSE|5.0|There is an energy in this album (along with the other pre Spag. albums) that can not be replicated. The stars lined up just right for a handful of times in the past 50 years, and included in the list of those to benefit is the GUNS N ROSES beast from 87-93. Although contemporary times always make the past look tame, there is still no denying the ferocious, controversial beauty that will probably always be associated with GNR.<br />I'm not in the generation that's supposed to listen to Guns. I was 11 when the Illusions came out, so that meant that while everybody was telling me that Kurt Cobain was the only thing that was cool, I was just discovering the TRUE POWER of music, which is highly inclusive of the mighty Guns. Also a classically trained pianist, let me say I am very open-minded. But regardless of society's pressure to keep up with the times, I still haven't heard anything since the Illusions that can offer such a profound release of anger, tension, stress, and hurtful emotion. Fans ferociously guard \\"Appetite...\\" as the definitive album, and there's obviously a whole host of good arguments for that - but although it was at the expense of the band's unity, I maintain that the Illusions pulled off every epic human goal that music can provide, justifying Axl's egocentric addiction to perfectionism. Here's the review of 1, which although it doesn't pull off the \\"greatest album of all time\\" -ness of 2, it is the biggest pack of a punch that good hard rock has ever been able to muster.<br />The songwriting, performing, attitude, musicianship - EVERYTHING - came together with \\"Appetite\\" - but now, with a few more dollars in their pockets, the Gunners could take that same vision and get the recordings polished to perfection. I conceed that that is \\"for better of worse,\\" in that many people prefer a raw sound, and that appeals to many Appetite heads (and I'm one of them!) But during the Illusions recordings, magic happened; a very spiritual (partially demonic) soulgot trapped into the tape, making these recordings transcend all laws of recording techniques, and when you listen to the metallic blues of \\"Dust N Bones\\", the more obscure \\"Bad Apples,\\" or the bone-crunching epic \\"Coma,\\" you can't help but bleed out all of your internal toxins. Music exists for a release (among other things), and no album has you dealing with your demons more intensely than Use Your Illusion I. Axl's lyrics read like a psychiatric report, which as I mention down below, wouldn't make sense if indeed they were a shallow party band. Indeed, this band was put here with a purpose.<br />Okay, so they weren't the BEST musicians around, but they weren't bad. And the group dynamic made up for the lack of technique many times over. Afterall, a strong element to the foundation of the band is punk, where attitude is all that matters. The fact that Guns had/have attitude PLUS other things to offer makes me say that that is the best thing you could try to get from any musician.<br />Which leads me right into the high compliment to this album's effective diversity. I play piano for a living, and Use Your Illusion 1 is like Appetite + piano and a few other things, which is why I hold 1 just a notch higher (not worth arguing about though). I could listen to the bluesy headbanging of \\"Dust N Bones\\" (and even more, 2's 14 years) all day long, jamming along on piano, and never want to go do anything else. The hypnotic electricity of this band should come in a bottle. Then there's \\"You Ain't the First,\\" a really cool acoustic ditty, a royal \\"Queen-like\\" cover of Sir Paul's \\"Live and Let Die\\", the staple ballad \\"Don't Cry,\\" the monstrously screaming metal of \\"Back off B@#$%\\", and the smash epic that needs no description, \\"November Rain.\\" I put on a piano recital which, after the Beethoven was over, included a full orchestration of this epic, strings and all. A pretty bold move for a conservative music school. With regards to those saying that if 1 and 2 were combined into one solid (though how much more solid do you want?) album it would be much better... I'll concede only as far as \\"Double Talkin Jive\\" and \\"Perfect Crime,\\" are concerned, which are the closest to filler that is on the first album (Slash's tasteful classical guitar licks notwithstanding). This album, especially when coupled with 2, has it all. Dave Matthews and Phish may open up their jams more, but they still leave you needing your Prozac.<br />It's funny how documentaries try to establish grunge as a return to seriousness after the partying of the 80's bands - but I never fell for grunge, and I've needed a boatload of musical anti-depressants in my life (who hasn't?). No, kids, Nirvana never really offered that much other than a meeting place for disillusioned teens. The magic of Guns was MUCH angrier, much more MUSICAL, and much more PROFOUND. [Why even mention the N word? Well as you should well know, \\"N\\" made it not cool to like GNR, which was a sad sad day for the future of the record industry.] But I digress... The characteristic style of randomly chosen subjects, let's say \\"The Garden\\" or \\"Dead Horse\\", holds up UNBELIEVABLY well today, and still tastes as fresh as it did a decade ago. And when it's all over, that is the true test.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Dull, Overated, Short, boring, lyrically stupid, full of filler, and definitely NOT a Rock Classic. I was tricked into buying this scum by the masses of reviewers who hailed this as \\"One of the Greatest Classic Rock Albums of All-Time!\\". Well, I'd heard Aqualung on the radio and thought that that was a good song, so what was to lose? Well, my money! Surprisingly to me, Aqualung turned out to be 1 of the only 2 good songs on this album! Fair warning to all potential buyers, if you buy this expecting this album to be a \\"Rock\\" album, you'll be disappointed! What you ACTUALLY are getting is a combination of blues and jazz, with almost no guitar and an over-emphasis on the flute. THE FLUTE! Granted, if you are a fan of any of those musical styles that I just mentioned, you will LOVE this album! Although, if you're not, like me, you will HATE this album! After rocking with the song Aqualung, Jethro Tull then plunges into suicide by playing 7 straight songs that are simply a flute with some backup drums! Finally, we get to the other good song Hymn 43, which is a radio staple and happens to be the only one with a guitar all throughout the song! Note that I'm reviewing the Aqualung without the extra tracks, but even if they are good it's simply not enough to make up for the rest of the album. I thought I would fall asleep during the misery that is My God and Wind-Up, which drag on for 7 and 6 minutes respectfully. Jethro Tull never tries inventiveness or originality, as all the songs are typical folk songs with tinges of jazz and blues, with hardly any vocals and mostly just flute solos! Also, the lyrics are childishly stupid, and are some of the worst I've ever heard. Since the album doesn't include the lyrics, simply download some of Aqualung's songs of the net and read them! They never fail to get a laugh out of you! And seriously folks, out of 11 songs, you only get 5 songs that are over 4 minutes, with the rest(Excluding Hymn 43) being just boring filler that takes up space! While Led Zeppelin and America manage to do good and even great folk/rock, Jethro Tull has never impressed me at all. This CD is really overated, and it's saddening to look at all the good reviews. If you're a fan of Rock, you won't like this. If you're a fan of folk, jazz, blues, or play a flute you will like this. Otherwise, this CD will simply bore you to sleep. Good for K5 teachers trying to find a way to get the kids to go to sleep at nap time! Also, if you listen to \\"Aqualung\\", the guitar riff is casually ripped off of Black Sabbath's \\"War Pigs\\"! That really angers me that one of only a few good songs on this album isn't even original!<br />(...) Thanks for reading!pace!

B000002UJQ|4.0|Every possible opinion in existence has been had by somebody with regards to Radiohead. Still, larger than the loyal demographic who actually purchases (and proactively listens to) their albums is the demographic which holds Radiohead with a substantial amount of respect in their minds. &quot;They do their own thing with integrity, never sell out, and make good music.&quot;<br />So here's just another person's shot at objectifying one of their most &quot;artistically accomplished&quot; recordings. Be forewarned, there will be some - gasp - opinions...albeit educated opinions...in my opinion.<br />&quot;Ok Computer&quot;, and Radiohead in general, is not prog rock. This is what's so frustrating when trying to &quot;categorize&quot; (all the hardcore fans can now raise their glasses)their music. Why categorize? Pigeonholing is by no means the ultimate goal, but even when developing one's own convictions about this music so he or she can encapsulize it into a review, it IS a head-scratcher that Radiohead is more or less a rock band - and you better damn well call them progressive.<br />But I found a way to crack the case. Think back to music 101 - the basic elements of ALL music are melody, harmony, pitch, volume, rhythm, spatial placement, - and TIMBRE (the particular characteristic of a sound that distinguishes a trombone from a clarinet). It is this latter characteristic that has been Radiohead's primary tool for shaping their music, bascially starting from this 1997 recording. From the beginning fluid line of &quot;Airbag&quot; to the closing strains of &quot;The Tourist,&quot; people have been drawn to this album - and Radiohead - for the band's talents at sprinkling so much electronica over their &quot;rock and roll&quot; and yet maintaining a mind-boggling human emotion aesthetic. It's as if two poles that should normally resist each other somehow defy the laws of physics. Now we can start giving the album some stars.<br />&quot;Let Down&quot; and &quot;No Surprises&quot; are the moments when all of the stars align. These songs feature a marriage of sensitive songwriting, harmonic innovation, and stellar atmospheric paintings. Along with crafty compositions like the well known &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot;,the soul from years gone by has stayed alive in rock and roll, but it is moving onward at the same time. That is what a great album SHOULD do, and the fact that most of the other songs are just as good (and the pace of the album has an uncanny flow to it) makes me start thinking &quot;historically significant recording.&quot;<br />But hold on there - those that want to analyze no further and accept Radiohead as the &quot;best band ever&quot; are blindly still getting sucked into the mainstream of the underground. This album gets much praise for artistically forging ahead - in a time where it's either Thom Yorke or the teeny bopper bands - but there's a whole lot of music out there that deserves the fight for the 5th star much more than these guys. I would plead for you to hold back from the negativity until you really check into what I'm talking about. Porcupine Tree, OSI, and Chroma Key, as examples, all have quite a bit up on Radiohead. Those bands are REALLY good, also trying to pave new ground while never veering from what they strongly believe in. But unlike Radiohead, they also have TREMENDOUS musicianship. And I'm sorry. But if you have the sound of the future, AND you can really play, you're going to keep my attention longer. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; goes off into some jamming, and there are some very intersting musical ideas in &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; and &quot;Exit Music&quot;. But all in all, if you are really hungry and are given the choice of a lonely chicken wing or an entire chicken, what in your right mind will you choose? Only problem is, you never really considered looking to eat a whole chicken. (I can see it now, 'reviewer tries to compare Radiohead to awing'). Don't get lost in the metaphors - just know that if you think Radiohead is really that great, you've probably never even heard of Chroma Key. Probably because regardless of who you are, popularity (nomatter how big or how small) will ALWAYS be an ingredient in the music choices people make. And I'm no less guilty than anyone else.<br />The bottom line is, I listen to this album over and over, having to try too hard to get into it. It speaks to me, but not nearly as strongly as I'd like. It's a shame, because one whisper from Mr. Yorke can be worth a thousand piece choir. And the lyrics are SOOOO amazing. The album IS really good, but it leaves me wanting. I need more. And so do many others out there.<br />It's not a bad thing, but Radiohead is not prog rock. It's just with their style of music, they would be better if they were, and too many people out there are trying to unfairly blur the line (isn't it blurred enough?). There are much better musicians out there with comparable hearts and ambitions. If you look elsewhere, you don't lose a Radiohead; rather, you gain some more awareness. And if you like this album, that means that you do not consider awareness an irrelevent factor.<br />&quot;Ok Computer&quot; belongs in anyone's cd collection. Given that you're reading about Radiohead, that means there's a hell of a lot of worse things you can be doing with your time. Peace.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is REAAAALYY Good!! It's like 25X time better than Let Go!! Avril really show her sensitive side and it makes a really good result !! You really show buy it, you will not be deceive!Ca
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Its definitly not what I was expecting, and to be completely honest the first time I listened I wasn't all that impressed! Thats just cause I was expecting to hear another version of Iowa, but it's completely different! The second time I listened to the album it grew on me and so on.. now I love it! It's brilliant. The heavy songs are the trademark Slipknot songs we all know and love, but then there's the slow songs! I know people are going to talk about selling out.. blah blah blah, buts thats crap. They're slow and melodic but they're not love songs! Like it or not Corey Taylor has one brilliant voice so I say why shouldn't he use it! Everything about this album is brilliant, the music is the best we've heard from Slipknot yet! Buy it! NOW!
B0000035E7|5.0|now one thing that set this album apart from the others is on this one the drummer here is chad channing. not david grohl. dave started drumming with nirvana on the eve of nevermind. this is an awesome debut album and they made it for 600$ but it was worth every single penny. this album also has a lot of emphasis on the bass and bass drum. i play a bass so i really like to listen to this album when i need ideas for things to play. listen to songs like &quot;Love Buzz&quot; &quot;Papercuts&quot; &quot;Big Cheese&quot; and &quot;Blew&quot; there is a lot of bass in those songs. this is definetly worth it.
B00008D1NF|5.0|As a connisseur of Brazilian music, I set my standards very high. Simply put, this album is a landmark achievement, lyrically and rhythmically. Marisa Monte, already recognized for her solo work, justifiably cleaned up at the Latin Grammys with this album. So infectious was the track &quot;Ja Sei Namorar&quot; that I heard the song played on public radio in California- the first time I've ever heard a Portuguese song played on public radio in my two decades as a Californian. I recommend the track &quot;Passe em Casa&quot;, though the entire disc is a soothing journey through some modern sounds of Brazilian pop-fusion.
0385336810|1.0|I picked up this book thinking it would be a fun read but I did not anticipate that it would be this predictable and uninteresting. I was personnally very disappointed and would not recommend it to anybody unless they have never read anything else their whole life. Then maybe they would find this book somewhat amusing!
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Sure, they just released a live album a few years before this one (Different Stages, 1998), but when you got something this good on tape, why not share it with the world, right?<BR>Rush In Rio was something that had to be released for a few reasons. #1 -- It marked the band's successful return after an indefinite hiatus that could have been the end of the band. #2 -- The band were able to release a live DVD package for the first time and the CD was a natural counterpart to that release. #3 -- It allowed the band to do something they had never been able to do before, something fans have cried for for years -- give us the whole freakin' show!! #4 -- Listen to that crowd!<BR>On top of all of this, it shows that after 30 years, Rush can still play circles around most bands half their age. And it gave us live versions of New World Man (the first ever version on a live disc! Finally!), better versions of Limelight and Dreamline than the ones on Different Stages, an acoustic version of Resist, and they brought back By Tor and Cygnus (even if it isnt the whole thing, so what?), cranking out versions that are better than the albums that were released so many years before. <BR>So ignore the cynics and buy this disc and the DVD.
0790742780|5.0|I reviewed this movie 5 years ago for VHS and had not visited LA at that time.  5 years and 2 visits hence, I felt the need to review this feature again for DVD.  Michael Douglas(as Bill &quot;D-FENS&quot; Foster)is a man who paid his dues and bought into the American Dream in a place once considered the Promised Land- Los Angeles, CA. It's definitely not the LA of old, the magical place where the weather is warm and the skies are blue. It is not difficult to sympathize with Bill as he plugs on through a dirty urban wasteland with one thought in his bewildered mind...to see his daughter, his hope for the future. It is a lesson for us all to be a little more civilized and a little more empathetic to the ones who find it harder to adapt...Otherwise there will be more Bill Fosters...And far more lethal than he was.<br />Robert Duvall (as Officer Prendergast) is a man who but for the grace of a Higher Power could have ended up a casualty like Bill. He understands the life of quiet frustration that Bill has had to lead, yet he tries with all his might to adapt to the misfortune that is 1990s' Los Angeles. Prendergast realizes that he must NOT be seduced into the abyss of savagery that has subsumed Bill. FALLING DOWN is the classic story of a black-and-white moralist who cannot distinguish the various shades of gray that our world has become. In my opinion the most important message of this movie is how two men with very similar backgrounds deal with the challenges of urban life, whether in L.A., NYC or any other metropolis. THIS is what separates the &quot;good guy&quot; from the &quot;bad guy&quot; in modern society and asks YOU--the viewer--this question:  Are you the problem or the solution?
0385720920|1.0|Having endorsed LULLABY and SURVIVOR, I decline doing so for CHOKE.  I bought CHOKE and INVISIBLE MONSTERS and picked up CHOKE first because the writing seemed more promising.  <br />CHOKE offers familiar territory for Palahniuk's readers: an underachieving, insensitive and irresponsible protagonist living on the urban agonistic underbelly.  Interesting plot twists and the original narrative satires of the middle class follow.   Books manufactured from this mind challenge what you believe about free speech, spirituality and materialism and responsibility.<br />CHOKE is vulgar, the plotting awful, the characters' irritating and undeveloped and though the book entertained it didn't provoke the reader into challenging assumptions we make about the way things are as did other books.<br />Writing about sex and its impact on the individual, society and our intuitions is one thing.  Erotica and fantasy writing is another thing.  I felt like Palahniuk was trying to say something about sex by writing about it so much but instead found himself filling pages with his sexual fantasies and asinine assumptions he makes about sex and women.  In that regard, it is what he says about sex thoughtlessly that is worth contemplating.<br />The book should be re-titled as the book deals less with the Good Samaritans he fleeces and more with sex - especially crass exploitative sex.  Palahniuk fails to weave the subplots on Christianity and personal philosophy that would challenge and subvert his sexual fantasia.<br />The character development irritates the readers as it leaves too many questions unanswered.  Leaving questions unanswered allow the reader to come up with his own conclusions about big themes if the author through his work explores each possibility with gusto.  However, when Palahniuk does not explain the extreme actions CHOKE's cast.   What motivates Victor Mancini's sexual addiction? Why Ida Mancini live life on the run? Is she his real mother?  What did she do to him in hischildhood and who his real father is - this is a fascinating question in light of Janet Finch's WHITE OLEANDER? What makes Paige Marshall different than Nico, Tanya and Ursula?  Is she a married doctor and why is she so attracted to him?  Denny, the most likeable character, why and how did he get together with Cherry Daiquiri? What is the miracle he asks for and what is the deal with the rock castle?  No one likes to be teased.  After reading CHOKE, one feels cheated.<br />He does write a few funny sound bites and there is one scene where Mancini co-opts the front desk causes me to chuckle even today.<br />But ultimately, one gets the sense that here is an author brave enough to deal with the traumas of his personal life through his art ultimately chokes at his opportunity.

0316666343|4.0|From the first page your buttons are being pushed shamelessly, your emotions led on a leash, your longing for some kind of jutsice and relief pumped up to the uncomfortable bitter max. Which is precisely what happenes when a young girl is raped and murdred and then stuffed away somewhere so her family will never find her, never know what happened. There are too many true stories, too many Suzie Salmon's lost to the world. What Sebold creates is the impossible -- the disappeared victim speaking for herself, and watching the grief lay waste to her loved ones. The book got under my skin, regardless of some of the galling turns in the plot. Interestingly, I've just read a book about a man on a lonely trip to the bottom of the world whose dead friends and dead mother come back to life to keep him company -- and it's a true story. It's called IN THE GHOST COUNTRY and the esteemed Sydnmey Morning Herald newspaper recently described it as ''a superb dialogue on human frailty.'' Indeed it is.

B00009Z574|5.0|Let's now do justice to one of the most undervalued albums in Yes' catalog, &quot;Tormato.&quot; Why this album continues to get a bad rap is a mystery to me. I like this album very much, and consider it to be one of Yes' best, certainly somewhere in their Top 10 best. Honestly, what's so bad about &quot;Tormato&quot;? Absolutely nothing! Say what you want about the splattered tomato on the album cover, but the &quot;Tormato&quot; album itself is excellent. After several albums of lengthy, complex prog-rock (albeit great prog-rock), &quot;Tormato&quot; showed Yes loosening up a bit. The hallmark Yes sound is still there, but for &quot;Tormato,&quot; the band channeled their sound into shorter, simpler, more-direct kinds of songs. There's eight songs (which, for an early Yes album, is a wide variety!), Jon Anderson finally wrote some lyrics that you could actually *understand*, and there was certainly a more radio-friendly feel to this album than previous ones. This decision by the band to streamline their sound was partially inspired by the punk movement happening at the time, but I truly believe that it was to Yes' benefit. They couldn't do &quot;Fragile Part II&quot; or &quot;Close To The Edge Part II&quot;---they'd done those albums already. I'm certainly not going to knock the classic early Yes stuff, which I love, but when I play &quot;Tormato,&quot; I hear the band doing something fresh &amp; different from their previous records. It's GOOD.The band's songwriting, playing, and Jon Anderson's majestic singing on &quot;Tormato&quot; are all in peak performance. &quot;Don't Kill The Whale&quot; is a great, catchy number that could've easily been a hit for the band. &quot;Madrigal&quot; is a lovely tune with Rick Wakeman playing some truly beautiful harpsichord. &quot;Future Times/Rejoice,&quot; &quot;Release Release&quot; &amp; &quot;Arriving UFO&quot; show Yes rocking on all cylinders. &quot;Circus Of Heaven&quot; (featuring a spoken word outro by Anderson's young son Damion) is quite charming. &quot;Onward&quot; is one of bassist Chris Squire's finest moments with the group. And &quot;On The Silent Wings Of Freedom&quot; is a terrific album closer, a great jam with soaring vocals from Anderson. Whatever stresses &amp; strains the band were reportedly under at the time they recorded &quot;Tormato,&quot; you'd never guess it from the way they sound on this album---this is a very upbeat, happy-sounding Yes record that's always a pleasure for me to listen to. Honestly, I don't know what the heck anybody is talking about when they give &quot;Tormato&quot; a bad review. In my opinion, there's NOTHING bad about &quot;Tormato.&quot; It's one of the group's finest works, whether anybody realises it or not! It's a great Yes album, splattered tomato and all.
B00008ADPF|1.0|terrible, i heard a recording of &quot;someday&quot; and &quot;how you remind me&quot; being played over each other with the same beat, structure, everything.  the verses, choruses, bridge, and guitar solo were exactly the same.  too formulaic, listen to radiohead, the smiths or the pixies instead.
B00005JM0B|5.0|This is definitley the best movie Arnold has done since True Lies in 1994. I liked movies like The 6th Day and Eraser, but this one is much better.<br />John Connor is now in his 20's and he is off the grid i.e. no phone, internet, ot credit cards. Nothing that can be tracked by computer. And becaue of this, the new Terminator is sent back to kill those who would eventually be his top people in the war against the machines. He is eventually found and tracked leading to a bunch of great chase scenes and special effects that are as good or better than T2.<br />The movie gets off to quick start and the action keeps on coming non-stop. A very exciting fast paced movie with a little bit of humor added. The story on a whole is pretty good and the ending helps improve that even better. A must see for all Arnold fans and anyone who likes the Terminator series.
0060589272|4.0|\\"Eleven Minutes\\" is the first book I have read by Paulo Coelho.  Although there were some things about it which I felt detracted from the overall experience, I ended up reading it in one day, which is about as high praise as you can give a book.  This is a story which has been done before, where a young woman (Maria) leaves her home to seek fame and fortune and ends up on the streets.  What this book does very well, is show the difference between sex and love, and the writing makes one want to follow the story all the way to the end.<br />There are some flaws though, some of which may be due to the translation.  For one thing, the absence of drugs seems to be unrealistic, but perhaps that was the correct decision, because in this story sex is the drug that is being used.  Another oddity that distracted me was how the narrative shifted from Maria's point-of-view to another character's for brief periods.  Overall, these problems are small though, and this book is very interesting to read.

0761536434|5.0|Having been born in 1984, I was open to the video game revolution when Nintendo became a big influence.  My life revolved around near worship of Nintendo of America.  From buying the systems, games, and gear, I totally immersed myself in the culture of video games.  However, I was not aware of the heritage that had preceded my birth and the work and love that had gone into the video game industry.  This book has opened my eyes to that and has given me a much greater appreciation for the work done by the great geniuses in the video game industry.<br />Kent begins with the major pinball companies to give you a grounding in the leading companies that would eventually move into the coin-op and then consumer video game businesses.  The book chronicals the making of games from a ragtag group of MIT students to Nolan Bushnell's grand experience of Atari and then all the way up to Microsoft proposing X-Box.  The major focus of this book is the early years of gaming.  Much of the material chronicals the work of the early Coin-op and console manufacturers.  This is a very refreshing view of the industry, showing the original roots of the market.<br />I definitely suggest this book.  Kent's light-hearted style is augmented by the thoroughness of his work.  This book is brimming with direct quotes from the major players in the gaming industry.  If you have had an interest in the work done to make the video game industry as popular as it is, this book is a definite suggestion.  Read away!
B00004WEJZ|5.0|I kinow this film has not received the acclaim of other Bond films but for the life of me I don't know why not.  So what if the story is borrowed from a previous film...Dirty Harry, You Got Mail, etc were all variations on a theme.  <br />No, this was the return of the TRUE James Bond, the one and only Sean Connery.  Here he is older yet wiser, not as foolhardy but still daring, and though his libido must have subsided a tad, he is still the ladies man.  Kim was great as the bad guy's gal pal.  Equally good was the villian himself, not as totally outlandish as some of the previous ones.  Several scenes stand out....<br />The Tango (fantastic and it was reprised with the...) Arab auction.  (What a great opportunity for Bond to make a - pardon the pun - dashing entry).  Then there was the game for the world and who can forget the over the top performance by Barbara Carrerra as the sexy Fatima Blush.  Where DO they come up with these names?  Good plot, good characterization and good ending.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Unlike a lot of people, I can actually admit this is a great album despite it being by Britney Spears.  The songs are stellar, as far as production, lyrics, composition, and even vocals.  The highlights for me are: Early Mornin', Touch of my Hand, Breathe on me, Outrageous, Everytime, and Toxic.  Give this album a listen and I'm sure you'll find a lot to like.  I'm not even much of a fan of Britney, however I've gained respect for her with this album.  I can also admit when my pre-conceived notions were proven wrong, unlike most on this site.  I've gotta give Britney credit for this great album, which is much better than a lot of albums that are rated 5 starts.  Highly recommended!
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Russell Crowe does a superb job of portraying British naval hero \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey as he pursues a bigger and better-prepared French ship off the coast of Brazil in the early 1800's.  He is an inspiring leader, who keeps his eye on his objective while encouraging and mentoring his crew.  Paul Bettony gives a very good performance as the ship's doctor who gives his friend Aubrey his honest opinion about his decisions as the ship's commander.  The Dr. is fascinated by the unknown creatures he sees on the Galapagos Islands and is very disappointed when his specimen-collecting expedition is interrupted by the reappearance of the French ship.  This is a beautifully filmed movie with lots of action and good performances by the actors.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I was suprised that this only had a 4 star rating from the fans on Amazon.com as of 5-30-04, it deserves a 5 star rating.  The songs are well written, and I can listen to the entire album without skipping any of them.  I did see, as I was reading the reviews, that people either loved this album, which most of them did and rated it 5 stars, or else hated it, and rated it 1 star.  Most of the ones that hated it said stuff like &quot;this album sucks, she's not punk&quot; or something to that effect, but there were very few bad reviews on the music itself.  These people are probabily the &quot;Avril Haters&quot; that I hear about, and would rate it badly no matter how good it is.  Actually, 4 stars isn't that bad, considering there are so many 1 star reviews to throw it off, but the album should be rated 5 stars.  It's that good.  All of the songs stand out to me, but &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, and &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; are the best songs on the album, to me.  Definately, this album is a good buy, no matter how it's rated.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|From reading all the these people's reviews, I thought I'd post my own. I personally enjoyed these songs, though I'm not much of a puck rock person and it took me a while to get used to the songs. I will say that from all those people who say &quot;I hate Avril, stay away!&quot; or &quot;Go Avril! Buy this album,&quot; no one has found their statements helpful. Overall, I must say that I'm still not much of a punk rock person, but Avril has a very awesome voice. If you're on the fence about buying this album, go find someone who has it and listen to it first!
B00004Z459|1.0|I could simply state that &quot;linkin park sukz ass,&quot; which, arguably, they do. However, I'll try to give a more intelligent, well-thought review of this album, or, while I'm at it, the band in general, because a grammatically challenged &quot;review&quot; that makes it clear that you hate Linkin Park, in reality, does nothing except possibly work toward lowering the album's average rating on Amazon.com.<br />Let's start with, first and foremost, the lyrics. I looked them up on the internet, and despite the apparent lack of enunciation, there are words. The lyrics aren't &quot;bad&quot; per se, but they aren't nearly as good as the band, and everyone else on the planet, seems to think they are. For the most part, the lyrics are very straightforward, portraying a literal representation of whatever depressing &quot;issue&quot; they chose. Admittedly, the lyrics are not devoid of metaphors, but when metaphors are used, they are very weak and obvious.<br />The music: this is not an incredibly talented group of guys. Chester Bennington screams. And screams. And screams some more. I'll give him props for two things: not having laryngitis and having a name that sounds a lot like Chad Pennington. Back to the music. The lack of a bass player really hurts the music. I'm not suggesting that an excellent bassist could save the band, but the if bass guitar is an important component, and although it's easy to take for granted, you simply cannot go without it. The drums are incredibly simplistic, and although drums don't mean a great deal to me compared to guitar, vocals, and bass, I'd at least like to be able to say something nice about them. <br />The guitar is, like everything else about this band, mediocre. To their credit, in a roundabout sort of way, the guitars are basically on-par with that of most nu-metal bands today. <br />Despite my analytical criticism, I think more than anything it comes down to one thing: I hate the way they sound.<br />To each his (or her) own, I suppose, but in all honesty, a sound that matches that of popular tastes will buy you short term success, but only with true talent and good lyrics will you ever attain the status of a legend.  <br />Modern Bands/Artists That Will Be Remembered: See Eminem, Marilyn Manson.<br />(By the way, did I mention that I hate the music of both of the above artists?)
0156027321|5.0|I have to say, this is the best book I've read in a very long time. Yann Martel is a terrific story writer, and you find yourself lost on the Pacific with Pi and Richard Parker (a tiger), and loving it. I actually listened to the book, read by the author, and I have to say, it was delightful. His Indian accent was beautiful, and brough true life to Pi. You laugh, you cry, and in the end, well, you'll just have to read it yourself. Wonderful!
B00005LC4G|1.0|Buy the Childs play pack that includes part 3 rather then this. I dont know why part 3 isnt included here, or why they would group 2 and 4 together?<br />Instead of this, buy Childs play 1. and &quot;The Chucky Collection&quot;(bride of chucky/childs play2/childs play 3)
B00006RINF|5.0|Comalies and Fallen (i.e. reviewers comparisons to Evanescence) are both A++ works that belong in everyones collection.  They take modern rock to a whole new level, at a time when the popularity of rock has diminished.  Everyone in the USA should tell their friends about Lacuna Coil, because Italian rock bands probably don't get much coverage.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I've waited for avrils second album for ages and when it finally came out i bought it straight away. Its different from thwe first album. its a lot more grown up and you can relate to the songs. It includes a bonus track in the uk and it is great. the guitar in the album is great and it is perfect for air guitar (!!!!!)great album avril, can't wait 4 the next!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Without butting heads with the diehard Slipknot fans (which I am admittedly not) or engaging myself into the &quot;selling out / going mainstream&quot; argument, I would like to say that this is an, at times, brutal CD. And, at other times, it is a beautiful CD. Yes, I just declared a Slipknot CD BEAUTIFUL. So may I burn.<br />Vol 3. : The Subliminal Verses is so accessible it's ridiculous. Regardless of what you listen to the majority of the time, you will find something to quench your musical thirst on this CD.<br />The acoustic songs, although some disagree, are wonderful. They really showcase the bands talent to write acoustic songs and show they are unafraid to stray away from their usual bone-crunching tunes. All the acoustic songs are generally dark but are sung extremely well (Corey Taylor's vocal range boggles my mind) and have perfectly accented acoustics and thought-provoking lyrics. And, if you really listen, you might catch the violins or pianos playing in the background.<br />Then again, if you're a fan the brutal side of Slipknot, you will not be displeased. A couple of songs on the CD are just as bone-crunching and headbang worthy as their older material. The occupiers of the moshpits will not be disappointed.<br />And then, there are a couple of songs that hit an AWESOME blend that lies right in the middle. Extremely hard songs that take time to consider a melody, an extremely apparent melody. Slipknot's famous tempo changes still occur during the song, but instead of changing from one loud piece of a song to another, they stop and slow the song down, chill it out, let you think it's over... and then BAM.<br />I have the other Slipknot CDs. But I did not buy them, they were given to me. However, I took some time and some cash to purchase Vol. 3 : The Subliminal Verses. I've listened to it several times through and through, not skipping one song, and it's getting better every time. <br />My favorite tracks: Duality, Opium of the People, Circle and tracks 10-14 (Before I Forget, Vermilion Pt. 2, Nameless, Virus of Life and Danger, Keep Away)<br />As you can see, that's pretty well licked all the songs. That's how good this CD is. 'Pulse of the Maggots,' while a good song, is one of my least favorites on the CD but it's still good.<br />Definitely worth it.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I wanted to see this movie in theatres..but never got around to it. Being a 18 year old who loves Disney movies and has never read the real versions of the stories I was afraid I wouldn't like this movie, not being animated and full of singing. But I bought it..and watched it. The first 30 min I was so excited on how fantastic I was sure it was gonna get worse...IT DIDN'T! I loved this movie so much. Everyone, I believe, was PERFECT for their part. Sumpter (Pan)was very good (directed toward the few who said he was horrible...I'm sure he's a better actor than you!) and though he does have a funny grin, he has the exact look for the childish peter pan. I loved the extra bit of romance between the two. I cried. Really i did. My overall note...unless you have a closed mind...you'll LOVE this movie!
B00008J2DQ|1.0|When it comes to music, I am a darwin-ist.  The problem here is the mountingly stagnant lyrical content, derivative of practically everyother metal band previous, and I wasn't too happy with their lyrics either.  If you want a band that is post-grunge nonsence, go with Seether.  At least they sing with the passion the original had.<br />Oh, and props to the guy who recommended In God We Trust Inc., Cheers!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I counted down every day of the month up until the 25th, when this came out, having heard the singles &quot;Duality&quot; and &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot; on the radio all the time.<BR>Now that I finally have it, it was worth the wait.<br />It's a bit different, especially on &quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Vermillion 2,&quot; which are both accoustic guitar tracks, the latter even using some orchestral strings.  I think this album really reflects how the members of Slipknot have changed since their 2001 release IOWA.  On Vermillion 1, Slipknot take influences from a crappy band like Tool/Perfect Circle and improve upon it until it becomes a good song, in which he describes stalking a woman and not knowing why.  But overall, this album has a more polished, cleaner sound (not only in its absence of the parental advisory sticker).  The mixing is a little better than the previous two albums, but also the guitars are less distorted, having first gone from the bone-crushing blasting of the self-titled album to the more compacted but still wild shredding of IOWA, and now to the more Marilyn Manson sounding material of Vol. 3.  Also notable is that they have included several guitar solos in this album, which are quite impressive.<br />1)Prelude 3.0:  a decent start to the album, but it doesn't relly create the effect of 515.  Actually, If I hadn't known this was by Slipnot, I would have mistaken it for a Nine Inch Nails song, which is a good thing.  It's just different.<br />2)The Blister Exists:  YEAH!  This song is awesome, as is the effect of the sudden segue from the prelude into the harsh headbanging of this song.  True Slipknot guitar riffs, and great singing, as well as the marching band from hell interlude right in the middle.  It doesn't quite live up to either of the precious Track 2's, though with its melodic chorus (which isn't too bad)<br />3)Three Nil:  This song is really good as well, with awesome lyrics.  Nice guitars, nice vocals, nice drums.<br />4)Duality:  mmm... it's okay.  Think &quot;My Plague&quot; except harder.  The verses are low, drawling, spoken word, which is cool, though the chorus gets really melodic (kinda reminds me of Disturbed, but not really).  The video is cool, though.<br />5)Opium of the people:  Another good, hard, song.  Not much to say.<br />6)Circle:  aha... I knew they were going to do something like this on this CD.  It's the only song on the album that I don't really like.  I know it's good that they're expiramenting and all, but this sounds kind of like folk music.  It's okay.<br />7)Welcome:  Really hard stuff. Basically Slipknot's calling out all the people who have gone against them, tried to hold them down, or otherwise impaired their progress as a band.<br />8)Vermillion:  This is a mellow song, but I like it anyway.  Really, really dark, without getting so hard as People... or their other stuff.  I like the lyrics in this song a lot, and the kind of mellow guitar solo at the end.<br />9)Pulse of the Maggots:   &quot;Rockin,&quot; as an unknown radio DJ says right after the song is over.  This song basically describes all the stuff they've been through as a band (hey... so does just about everything else on this whole album... pattern?) and serves as a general tribute to their fans, the &quot;maggots&quot; (not exactly complimentary, but it works).  This song is so hard... I love playing this song on the guitar.  Features some more industrial-sounding beats (while still staying metal) and great guitar riffs, featuring a back-and-forth guitar solo that is more than reminiscent of Slayer (afterbeats on the snare drum and everything) and an interlude that sounds similar to the one in &quot;Disasterpiece&quot; from IOWA, with the pounding guitars going up to a screeching high note.  Great song.<br />10)Before I forget: It's decent.  Pretty melodic.<br />11)Vermillion pt. 2:  This is pretty good, for such a slow song.  Features complete accoustic guitars and strings, as well as harmonies in the vocals.  Whatever.<br />12)The Nameless:  This song doesn't really stand out, but it's good.  A lot like the other songs on the album.<br />13)The virus of life:  I love this song, even though there isn't much musicality in it at all, just a sort of pounding rythm on all the instruments while Corey chants &quot;This is the virus, the virus of life&quot; in a really menacing tone.<br />14)Danger - Keep away:  Not many lyrics here, mainly an outro.  Nothing compared to the closing track of the second album, Iowa, and it's only about three minutes long.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I like the music a lot.  Thanks to my kid brother who bugged me to get it for him, since music is not part of my world and i tend to listen to whatever friends recommend.  It surprised me because i don't normally enjoy songs that involve the vocalist screaming, either.  The instrumental track's sort of interesting<br />That said, this album's monomanic.  The songs all have the same theme: singer escaping from someone who's been controlling him.  Kurang variety.  <br />(And if anyone feels like attacking my review for lack of insight,  i freely admit that i know nothing about music.  Totally word-oriented.)
067940581X|5.0|Jane Austen's book Emma is creatively woven together with the characteristics of Emma Woodhouse, a young lady with much prestige. Even though the flaws of her character are questionable, her intentions are clear. Her role as a matchmaker during a unique time period creates a diversion from reality in the high social class where Emma resides. The encouragement by one lucky guess pushes her to create absolute non-sense. A reader only hopes to read faster in order to reveal and figure out the out come of all her mistakes. Emma hooks readers, addicting them to the humor and \\"tangled mess\\" in which she finds herself. This beautifully illustrated book quickly creates an exclusive impression every time it is read.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is such a heart-warming and touching story, with the usual British style humour, which is very charming. Several love stories told in parallel to each other, with the characters somehow connected in life, I find the characters are more realistic than most of the romantic films. For example, we're not always brave enough to confront to someone. And even if we are brave enough, it seldom is like the typical love movie where the guy gives a passionate speech. In this film, there are full of this kind of characters and moments, which I think most of us can relate to.<br />This film is particularly successful at portraiting the character's inner emotions, which is done in a very convincing way, with nice background music and not too much talking. Some elements of this film might be cliches, but if you don't want any cliche then I suggest you to go to another department.<br />In summary I enojoyed this film, and I recommend it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I loved Avril since I heard her first album &quot;Let Go&quot;. She is different, has a great voice, and an excellent sense of individuality. My favorites from her first album were: I'm With You, Anything but Ordinary, Losing Grip, Tomorrow, and Complicated. I have been waiting for &quot;Under My Skin&quot; for a while now and got it a few days ago. It is a lot darker and deeper than her first album but I still like it. Esp. Take me Away, My Happy Ending, Together, Nobody's Home, and Fall to Pieces. I think the lyrics are easy to relate too, and listening to Avril provides me with a sense of calmness. I love Avril Lavigne, she is truly the BEST! =)
B000000ZGO|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this recording.  This is indeed a masterpiece and has firmly cemented Ike in the hall of fame, even if he had never recorded another song.  While I was a very young child, (10)when this album came out I will never forget my mom listening to this ablum over and over again.  This was one of her favorites and is very high up on my top 10 list.  This recording still moves me to this day.  The sheer power of the music and Ike's soulful voice shows his genius and why he still pack's concerts today.  If you are not moved by this music then you are probably brain dead.  This is soul music and it's most basic level.  The pain and heartache comes through on &quot;By The Time and One Woman&quot; better than any soap opera on TV or any other song I have ever heard.What can I say about &quot;Walk On By?  Burt Bacharach must have had tears of joy in his eyes when he heard Ike's version.  This is how the song should have been done in the first place, sorry Dionne.  Hyperbolicsyllabisesquedalymistic is funk in it's purest form.  If you can only buy one Isaac Hayes recording forget Shaft, this is the one.
B0000029GA|5.0|This cd is NOT the best rap cd at all, but dont get me rong its a east coast classic and a great lyrical album. To call this the best rap cd of all time is foolish. How can u wen ther r cds such as wutang's, Enter the 36 chambers, BDP's By all means necessary and TCQ's, The low end theory. <BR>Now back to the review, this cd is exremely good lyrically but lacks a little on beats which brings it down. NY state of mind's beat is awesome tho, sam wit The world is yours beat. Anyways, great cd for a true hiphop head, definitly worth ur cash an time.
B000089RVR|4.0|This is an album that has grown on me a little more with each listen. At first, only a few songs stood out. With time, others seeped their way into my brain and became favorites. The lead single &quot;White Flag&quot; is my favorite song. Maybe cliche, but the song is great and vocally she sounds excellent, not to mention it has a great hook and overall is an incredible pop song that is very memorable. I like the song &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; as well, there is a warmth to her vocals that gives depth to the song (and others). The title track is a nice confessional ballad. &quot;Stoned&quot; is another favorite, it has an electronica flair, it definately grew on me a lot. Other favorites include &quot;See You When You're 40&quot;, &quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot;, &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot;, and &quot;Do You Have A Little Time&quot;.

B0001NBMBC|2.0|First of all.  When you go on headbangers ball and say \\"bands that can't evolve should \\"poop sound.\\"  and then come out with this eclectic piece of crap.  You probably need to \\"poop sound.\\"<BR>I am a metal fan.  in mostly all of its forms.  Slipknot was deffinitely one of my favortie bands of all time.  Brutal with a hint of melody and a ton of techincal drumming and riffing.  This album kinda has all that but the melody shot up like 100 times, the brutal dropped down like 75 times and the technical part got almost butt-rock at times.  <BR>Duality is probably the best song on the cd.  Although being the bands \\"Wait and Bleed\\" or \\"Left Behind\\" of this album its deffinitely the best put together song.  Its the only melody on this cd i find catchy.  Most songs on this album lack direction.    <BR>The heavy stuff goes no where.  There'll be a good solid groove everyone once and a while.  The build up sections always go no where.  <BR>Joey is still a badass drummer (one of the best).<BR>Mich is still righting some good riffs, some on this album even come close to death metal sounding. And the acoustic stuff was well writtin (i'll give it that). The recording sounds like ass.  The guitar tone is junk.  almost as bad as St. Anger. The music as a whole lacks a lot of energy.<BR>Corey... there is not one scream on this cd that sounds good in my opinion.  His anger filled gutteral growl is now non-existant.  <BR>Its been replaced with a annoying yell, almost that of a hardcore singer (not one of the better ones), its also very double tracked and layered.  The singing (melodys) is good for stone sour.  I personally do not think there is one catchy melody outside of duality on this album.  The acoustic songs are good.  if it wasn't slipknot.  How are the gunna play a lot of this live.  All dressed up ... with acoustic guitars. <BR>I was really hoping you guys would save all this garabage for your side projects.  instead one of the only really heavy band that was bringing more and more people into the metal scene had to \\"evolve.\\"  Hey i'm all for showcasing musicians.  But crapy melody (although song well), and butt-rock guitar solos, and a lack of brutality doesn't mean that to me.  <BR>I'm hoping road-runner had a lot to do with this change.  maybe its the Deicide or Fear Factory effect.  You guys are still badass don't go the route of korn and so many bands who've tried to out-do themselves in the wrong way.  If there is no way to improve the sound you guys originally invented.  Then change your name for this crap.  Look at bands like Dillenger and Meshuggah.  Brutal metal will never be dead as long as bands like this keep it going.  I still like this album more than most stuff out there but i would probably like it a little more if it wasn't slipknot.  <BR>(...)Stevil
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the year of 2003 Britney returned to the music scene from her wild year of antics with the infamous MTV kiss with Madonna. In November 2003 Britney released her stunning Cd `In The Zone'. Britney released her best album yet. She transformed herself from a sexy young teenager to a provocative young woman. In the Zone takes listeners though a journey of different styles of music. From Hard hitting dance tracks, to dirty ghetto Hip Hop to viby trance tracks to beautiful peaceful ballads. This album shows Britney at her best. This album made critics label her \\"The New Madonna\\".<br />Me Against The Music - The lead single from the album. It is the infamous duet featuring Madonna. It is a hard hitting club dance track any is very different from what is on the radios these days. The track is just about being in a club and being oblivious to everyone and freestyling. I couldn't think of a better way for a come back song. Britney could have released a typical R&B track for her return, but she wanted to be unique. She has definetly succeeded. This is my 2nd Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. 10/10<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom - This track is an Up-tempo Hip Hop track perfect for the clubs. The track has also has an Indian vibe to it. This track features the Ying Yang Twins, which gives the track a dirty ghetto, feel to it. This song is my 3rd Favourite song on the album, and is one of the best Hip Hop songs I have ever heard. 10/10<br />Showdown - The famous UK producers Bloodshy & Avant produced this track. It is a great sexy dance track which features Britney whispering \\"I don't wanna be a tease. Would you undo my zipper please\\" This track is done very well. Again very unique. 9/10<br />Breathe On Me - This song is very club-savvy orientated and is one of the most sensual tracks on the album. The song has a HOT beat and is reminiscent to Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head. This track describes the intensity of a relationship so hot that they don't even need to touch, just breathe. This is my Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. I can automatically see this song go #1 in Europe if it is released. 10/10<br />Early Mornin - The second this track commences you will automatically know that it is Moby produced. This track is very sexy and has a trance feel to it. The song is very vibey and is about the next morning after a big night out. 8.5/10<br />Toxic - This is the second single from the album which is produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The song is HOT and fits Britney perfectly. The track is a hard hitting dance track which could easily be used as the theme song to Alias or the next bond movie.This is the track responsible for rising her album sales all around the world. Critics are describing it the best song Britney has released since I'm A Slave For You. I love this track so much because of its uniqueness. 10/10<br />Outrageous - This is a typical R&B penned track. The second the song commences you will automatically realise it is R Kelly produced. This song is again perfect for the clubs and has an Indian vibe to it. The chorus is very catchy. 10/10<br />Touch Of My Hard -This is the most sensual song on the album. This song is a beautiful dance ballad reminiscent to Madonna's The Power Of Goodbye & Janet's That's The Way Love Goes. This song is an ode to masturbation. The song is Britney's most mature song to date and has a sexy vibe to it. This is definitely a stand out track on the album. 10/10.<br />The Hook-Up - Redzone, the famous team behind the Britney/Madonna duet, produced this track. This song has an R&B reggae feel to it and is fairly uptempo. 9/10<br />Shadow - This track is a beautiful ballad produced by The Matrix. This is very reminiscent to Avril's I'm With You. This track shows Britney's vocals at its best. I personally think this is her best ballad since Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. 10/10<br />Brave New Girl - This song brings back the days Britney was innocent. In every album she has to bring out the stupidness in her. She has done exactly that in this track. This track is very pop driven and could be used as the theme song to Legally Blonde. I personally think it is The worst song on the album and one of the worst songs I have ever heard. 1/10 <br />Every Time - This song is very peaceful and pleasant. It tells the story of heartbreak. The track features a beautiful harmony and goes well with the mood of the sound. She sings in lower key although it fits the song perfectly. Again another brilliant ballad from Britney. 10/10<br />Me Against The Music (Remix) - This is remix to the First Single. The song was remixed by Peter Rishi and an Indian vibe has been added to it. The song is still very clubby and is probably one of the best remixes I have ever heard. 10/10<br />The Answer - This is produced by P Diddy. The song has an R&B mid tempo flow to it. I really liked this song, but I was disappointed at the same time. When I heard the idea of Britney & P Diddy working together I was expecting an up tempo R&B track, although it was completely the opposite. 9/10<br />Don't Hang Up - The song is mid tempo and again has an R&B pop flow to it.This song is about Phone Sex. This song was produced by the same team behind Brave New Girl. I personally don't like this song and think she should never work with Brian & Josh again. 3/10.
B000005DQR|5.0|Dj shadow has proved that he is one of the greatest artists ever. With such diverse tracks and complex beats, Endtroducing will be something to look back on from years to come.
6304708491|5.0|Beatles in colour + them smoking way too much dope + lots of weird crap + the coolest house ever = great movie. It's my favorite one of theirs. Personally I think the only bad thing about this movie was the acting of the male middle easterners but I'm no proffessional movie critic so eh.  John Lennon's utter insanity shines through as always and something about watching the beatles beat up people seems very intriguing. <br />This movie has got the best collection of beatles song clips (videos) in the world. The tank scene is really great and the clip of &quot;you're gonna lose that girl&quot; has got to be one of the coolest beatles performances on tape. The camera looks like it's having a gushing orgasm of radiant blue colour.<br />Anyways, these Beatle movies shouldnt even be allowed to be rated. They could film themselves sitting drunk on lounge chairs for an hour and a half and people would call it a masterpiece. It's the Beatles for christsakes A+ I say.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Don't get jealous dude and dudettes, I mean if you think she's not good why in the world you come into here in the first place and if you hadn't listen to the whole album how could you review at all? And if you've bought and listen to this album, then if you hate it you gotta be stupid to buy it in the first place? Either way....its irrational to hate something before giving it a chance and above all its stupid. When you already bought this album, heard all through, give it a chance, then come back and review! I love Avril for her style, fake or not, live with it, every star out there has a fake image, that's called entertainment business dudes!!
0784011176|5.0|All the things that characterize a Hollywood romance are turned upside down and changed about in this film.  The usual fare is the interactions between two urbanites with huge polished smiles stuck to their faces.  They enter a relationship which is loud, giddy, and giggly.<BR>In The Piano, the woman doesn't speak at all and both men are stoic sorts who have lived in a hard land.  A lot happens under the surface where we can only guess at it.  In mainstream films, the emphasis for the man is rushing in and grabbing the woman of his dreams with all possible speed.<BR>But here, just once, the quiet, patient, and tender man emerges with the lady.  And what's more, when we first see him, we fail to see through his hard exterior.  Even the viewer comes to know this man's virtue only over time.<BR>I found this to be an incredibly beautiful story and as if that alone wasn't good enough, I also greatly enjoyed the cinematography and the music.  This is one of those films that I find guilty of being incredibly good on all counts.<br />And a final note about male nudity:  Yes it is in this film.  Both male and female are seen completely nude.  And there's nothing wrong with the male part.  We men have beautiful bodies too.  Art of the past has had no compunctions about showing nude males and correctly so.  I'm not sure I can understand this modern prudery.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|What happnened to Slipknot?I don't know but I like it. The new album is a very good piece of work, it's not as brutal as Iowa. It has great mellodies, great solos and a lot of power. Corey's voice dosen't bleed your ears anymore and I don't think that's bad at all. I can say that they sound a lot like slayer sometimes and System Of A Down (don't forget that Rick Rubin produced the record). The only thing I don't like is that I can't listen alot of the dj and the sampler..
B000069CWE|2.0|If you truely like the rock style of Linkin Park, don't buy this cd. The only good songs are KRWLNG, RNW@Y, and a few others. Most of it just techno/rap with other people singing. Try Meteora instead...
B00005JMUA|5.0|This movie is great.  I had just seen kill bill vol. 1 about 1 week before this and I rushed out to buy the dvd immediatly.  I have to admit when I eneterd the theater I was not expecting part 2 to be any where near as good as part 1; sequels never are. However when I left the theatre I couldn't believe how completely amazing this movie was.  Part 1 was full of action and lots of violence, in fact some of the best action I have ever seen.  Going into the theatre I was expecting much less action from the 2nd, and in a sense I was right.  Although 2 doesn't have nearly as much action as the first, it makes up for it in story.  But don't get me wrong the fight between the bride and elle is one of the coolest yet shortest fights that I have ever seen.  If you watched this movie together with the first you will see how diverse it is. The fact that Tarantino could have anamation, black and white, excessivly violent action, romance, drama, and twisted humor all together in one film and on top of that make it work unbelievably well is reason enough for anyone to buy this film, and it is also why I say the Kill Bill series is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen a crap load of movies after all I am chris the immature movie expert/ student film maker. BUY THIS!!!!!!!!
B000002KKS|5.0|In a world of wildabeasts and angels, Ronnie James Dio is in the most darkest, most evil thing created by man... Black Sabbath. He displays his most best work on Heaven and Hell, with songs that tell tales of children of the night, witches in the dark, and other things that go bump in the night can send chills down your back when listening. The music on this album is excellent, melodic and sweet and the lyrics very well written with some catchy songs such as Neon Knights, Lady Evil, and Heaven and Hell will leave you singing along with the beast of darkness. If you love classic heavy metal then get this record.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I loved Avril's first album and have been waiting for 'Under My Skin' for what seems an eternity.  Now it's here and I couldn't be more pleased.  I believe her quality in her voice is very much improved; her voice is more beautiful than ever.  In addition to the pop-sound most people think of when Avril is mentioned, she also provides rock, punk, and even slower songs.  I really love the different types of music.  I feel like I have lots of CDS that i'm listening to at once because of the variety.  Love it!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This was the most boring film I have ever seen!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|~Ok... this is a type of CD that you have to grow on the songs. If you didn't like it the first time...LISTEN TO IT AGAIN!! That's what happened to me..and after the second time I listened to it...I loved it! Yes, the songs are not as catchy as her first CD..there are no &quot;Complicated&quot; or &quot;Skater Boi&quot; songs, but that's not always a bad thing. The songs on her new CD have much more meaning and emotion into it. It's much more darker and deeper. But...out of her 12 songs...atleast half of~~ them have her saying &quot;Na na na na&quot; or &quot;Ah ah ah ah ah&quot; or &quot; hey hey hey hey&quot; or &quot;yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah&quot; and everytime she sings this is when Chantal Kreviazuk helped her write the songs...she brain washed her into singing this...lol. Break down of the songs...<br />Take Me Away - 9/10 A good start...One of the most rockier songs...this is supposed to be her third single but I think there are better songs than this for her third single...<br />Together - 10/10 Great Song. Love the~~ part right before the chorus. A potential good single for her.<br />Don't Tell Me - 9/10 Her first single. Not as good as &quot;Complicated&quot; was but its a top 10 single right now...<br />He Wasn't - 10/10 A song that sounds like what Lillix would do...this is the song where she sings &quot;Hey hey hey hey&quot; (Lillix) A good song though. Nice chorus..<br />How Does It Feel - 8/10 Ok Song..one of her slower songs. Talks about how does it feel being different from her... Not her best song..<br />My Happy~~ Ending - 20/10 WOWWWWWWW!!! Awesome song. This is her 2nd single. My favourite song on the CD. This is probably the song that is most like &quot;Complicated or Skater Boi&quot;. This has a potential to be a major hit!<br />Nobody's Home - 20/10 WOWWWW!!!! Another awesome song. This is the song with Ben Moody from Evanesence. Very sad and dark song...but very good!! Should be her third single..<br />Forgotten - 6/10 Usually skip this song..don't really like it...<br />Who Knows - 10/10 A good song. A happy~~ song!<br />Fall To Pieces - 9/10 The chorus is kinda blah...but the rest is good...<br />Freak out - 10/10 This song kinda grew on me. Like the chorus..<br />Slipped Away - 10/10 Another good song..song dedicated to her dead grandpa..~
0312263120|5.0|The more Dan Brown I read, the more I enjoy Dan Brown. The man is a master of the fast paced thriller and it is fun to watch his growth from one book to another even if I did begin my acquaintanceship with his blockbuster &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot;<br />  Brown's books always start fast and &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; is no exception. Ensei Tankado dies in a Seville plaza. He raises his hand, fingers outstretched . . . and dies. Susan Fletcher, a National Security Agency cryptographer is roused from her dreams first by a call from David Becker, her university professor boyfriend who tells her he has to postpone their planned weekend romantic retreat in order to fly off to an unknown destination. Seething and disappointed, her anger if interupted by a call from Commander Strathmore, her NSA boss asking - commanding - that she come in on this Saturday to help on an emergency project.<br />  It seems Tankado has launched an attack on NSA's most secret computers.<br />  From that point on, Brown takes you on a non-stop adventure - and it's fun.<br />  Brown's characters are well rounded and don't engage in super-heroics, though they do seem to catch more than their share of lucky breaks. But Brown's plotting carries you over those points so fast that you fail or simply don't want to notice them.<br />  For the thriller fan, &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; is an exhilarating read.<br />Jerry
B00004I9VE|5.0|I was given this album (yes a record) when I was 12, My Thriller album was mislabeled with Merle Haggard labels by the record company!!  This was the best album and I cried when I thought that it wasn't Thriller!!  Not a big Michael fan now, but man was I ever way back then!!
B00005K9LK|5.0|Well, this, in my opinion, must be JP's greatest LP. The awesome intro to the album with Hellion leading right into Electric Eye is dominating at first, but then you drive right into some equally massive tunes. After riding on the wind, a mediocre song, you are blown away by Bloodstone, with a super intro riff and a great chorus, thanks to rob, but that is just the beginning. (Take These)Chains is a great song, as is Pain and Pleasure (awesome guitar), but then the cd climaxes with such great tunes as the MTV favorite You've Got Another Thing Comin, the title song Screaming for Vengeance, and then my favorite song on the album, the AC/DC reminiscent Devil's Child. Album version is simple but insanely awesome, and the live version lives up to the studio in every aspect.<br />All in all, Screaming for Vengeance is the best non-compilation album... such great songs as were mentioned cannot be compared. <br />(Most people disagree with my opinion, but I do not think that Priest went downhill from here. They did experience a time of synthisizers and all that stuff (turbo), but they were just victims of changes. I think Ripper did a great job while he was here, and their later albums were better than some of their earlier LPs.)
B00005MP58|5.0|Splendid actors and actresses, and forever great plot originated from Jane Austin's Masterpiece. The best adopted version I've ever seen.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is without a doubt a classic film loaded with memorable lines and gunfight scenes. Not one person I know watched this and didn't love it. The only real thing I regret is just now seeing it. As far as the story goes, Fidel Castro has sent over Cuban immigrants to the U.S., with most of these being political refugees. And two of those immigrants are Tony Montana and his partner Manny Ray. In a camp where the immigrants were being held, Tony stabs a man who was once near the top of Castro's regime, and he enjoyed doing so because of some of the things this man did to the people in Cuba. So by virtue of his doing this, Tony and Frank get green cards and jobs in Miami. <br />Scarface represents the American dream to have it all, and he does come to have it all when he works his way up in the cocaine business.One of the best but also brutal scenes takes place when Tony and his partner are sent to make a pickup that goes wrong. Another guy that goes in with Tony gets chainsawed in the bathtub, which is brutal now but must have been much more so in its 1983 release.But eventually he works his way up, and his boss tries to off him, and this led to Tony taking over Frank(his boss), killing him and taking over the empire. From the beginning Tony viewed him as a weak man whose time was running out.He takes Franks former wife Elvira(played by Michelle Pfeiffer)and marries her.So at this point he had it all, the house, the wife, the money, everything a man could want in life.<br />I think another point brought out in the movie is that staying on top is harder than getting there, and this is evident when Tony becomes addicted to the cocaine. It along with paranoia contributed to his gradual seperation from everyone around him, causing him to hurt those in his way. I was shocked when he shot his partner Manny Ray who had been so loyal to him, but it was also in part to his overprotectedness of his sister Gina. Once he is on top, his control begins to spiral out of controlbecause of his distrust in anyone but himself, and his willingness to do everything in his power to keep his empire strong at all costs.His final demise is when he screws Sosa, a man he had set up a partnership with, by failing to return a favor by killing a politician who was bent on taking down Sosa and the cocaine industry that he saw as the fault of the South American government. The man makes a speech to the United Nations that he was not supposed to make and this seals Tony's fate, although the reason Tony would not kill the man was because a woman and children were with him. The final scene has Tony fighting till the very end when Sosa and his man invade Tony's mansion. It is one of the best closing scenes I have ever seen.<br />All in all the movie has a great message that power, or the excess of it, can bring down the strongest of men. The progression of Tony from Cuban immigrant to one of Miami's most powerful drug overlords makes for a great storyline, an I also thought this was a fantastically directed film by Brian DePalma, and after watching this you are sure to remember many famous quotes from the movie, of which would only be edited by Amazon if I quoted them here. I highly recommend this movie. There is a lot of violence, though it may seem tame to some these days, and a lot of profanity, paricularly the F word. It all works in this film though in keeping a real perspective of the cocaine industry at least as it was then. Kids should NOT see this, but if you are grown this is one movie you must experience for yourself for the story and the great soundtrack to it as well. This is a great DVD to own , and definately one of my top 10 movies of all time.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack.. the range of styles is amazing. It has a jazz track, goodness! I just got this today, and it is just.. wow. I am so glad, I'll never regret getting it. It's wonderful!
B000099T2L|1.0|How did Beyonce win 500 billion Grammys? How did her album go platinum 100 times? HOW???? I'm not dissing her fans or anything, but this CD-and Beyonce-is overrated. She was actually GOOD in Destiny's Child because Kelly Rowland has a good voice, and so does Michelle Williams. But when Beyonce went solo? Oh, puh-lease!!!! (...)
B000148KK2|5.0|I don't understand why the first review of this album is so negative and the next many reviews are sooooo positive!!!!  Maybe because the reviews are listed in the order they were received.  Would'nt it make sense to put the most positive ones first???  Purely, and merely, a suggestion.<BR>Signed,<BR>A huge Amazon.com fan!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I NEVER REALLY LISTENED TO SLIPKNOT MUCH UNTILL I LISTENED TO THEIR NEW ALBUM AND LET ME TELL YOU.......IT KICKS ASS!!!!!!!!  EVERY SONG IN THIS ALBUM IS JUST SO FREAKEN AWESOME.  THEY DO A GOOD MIXTURE OF SINGING AND SCREAMING. I ALSO LIKE HOW TWISTED SOME OF THE SONGS WERE. THE LYRICS IN THE SONGS WERE AWESOME TOO.  SLIPKNOT IS DEFENITLY AN AWESOME BAND AND AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM, I PLAN TO GET THERE OTHER ALBUMS.  ANYONE WHO LIKES SLIPKNOT OR METAL MUSIC OR MUSIC THAT FREAKEN KICKS ASS SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM.  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THAT YOU GO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001IPL|5.0|I remember when the song &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; came out.  The song was just so catchy; I just had to have the album...then I saw the cover and thought it might be really ugly music -- hardcore noise.  But I bought it anyway.<br />Boy, was I wrong for judging the album by its cover!  &quot;Smash&quot; is fun from start to finish, and has a frolicking sound that's a little less mainstream-friendly than those of the albums that followed &quot;Smash&quot;.  <br />It's a classic that you can listen to over and over without ever growing tired of it.  I think it's one of the greatest albums of the 90s.
B000068IEU|5.0|Mari &amp; Phyllis going to see bloodlust in concert... they are kidnapped by 2 escaped convicts, Krug Stillo, Fred Podowski, and tagging along with them is Krug's girlfriend Sadie, and his son Junior. They are driven into the woods where their life ends in rape &amp; murder. The gang unknowingly and co-incidentally take refuge at mari's parents home. When Mari's parents find out what happened to their daughter, they show the killers that civilised normal people can be pushed to the limit.<br />Director Wes Craven made his debut with this film and what an impact it made. When first released in 1972 it was banned. Craven made several attempts over the years to have it released, but he didn't make the cuts needed to have the film released...until Craven made the correct amount of cuts... in August 27th 2002 (May 26th 2003: UK) the film was released.<br />This film was based on true events. The names and locations were changed to protect the identity of those still living. This film is not for the faint hearted. It shows the madening space between life and death.<br />Overall Review : Buy It!!
B00008ADPF|1.0|Every few years a band comes along that's so profound, so talented, and so entertaining that they change the music scene forever. Unfortunately Nickelback is not one of these bands. They are the epitome of corporate rock. Their singles are played relentlessly on the radio in the hopes that listeners will cave and buy their tripe. I know all the lyrics to their first single, and I haven't once listened to the song voluntarily. Now, the reason many people dislike this album is because the songs all sound very similiar. Although true, this gripe pales in comparison to the AWFUL AWFUL lyrics. I've seen better writing in second grade book reports, and I've been more inspired by reading nutritional facts on the side of a cereal box. The lyrics are simple, meaningless, literal garbage. Lets take the lyrics \\"I like your pants around your feet...And I like the dirt that's on your knees...And I like the way you still say please...While you're looking up at me...You're like my favourite damn disease.\\" Hey Chad Kroeger, AKA captain literal- Why don't you just come out and say it...\\"i like the way you suck my %@$!.\\"?  Were you too scared you'd offend the 14 year olds that make up 99% of your fan base? I especially like how you threw the \\"damn\\" into the last line to get enough syllables, very classy. I'm sure that's one of many tricks you learned in creative writing class at your local community college. I'd like to thank you, Nickelback, for giving me yet another coaster for my coffee table. Not only that, but the cd sleeve will come in handy when I run out of toilet paper.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I really love this album. It's 20x better than Let Go. It's actually got a lot of serious stuff in it. It makes me think. You can definately see the influences of Raine Maida and Chantal Kreviazuk. I really love Raine Maida's band Our Lady Peace, so I guess that makes my opinion sort of bias, but still. It speaks volumes. I can't get over how much mature it is. It's got some really good themes. Especially Who Knows, it's cheerful and mature at the same time. I also like how it's not all about some stupid guy. She kept her voice and direction and just put it in a different sound. I like the new sound 20x better.
B0000029AP|4.0|Critics of this album would do well to note that with the exception of \\"Physical Graffiti\\" and \\"Who By Numbers\\" there wasn't one significant entre from a major AOR group all year; and this one thrashes both with room to spare.  Even if Steven Tyler is, at best, a poor man's Mick Jagger, Joe Perry holds his own against Keith Richards.  The band rocks without stooping to the usual hooks of a genre that hasn't done anything relevent since '71.  Sexist, sleazy, yes, but VERY good.  And \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" is my most favorite song in a long time.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Many know that teen queen Britney Spears is my all-time favorite living singer.  Her third release (which I bought opening day which I've done for most of her albums) simply titled BRITNEY is no doubt a work of art for the new-age pop era.  Its hot beats earn it critic acclaim.  Her vocals aren't the best...but so what?  They're unique and atypical from anybody else out there.  Plus it's not like she's really about her voice, is it?  No wonder Britney keeps garnishing Grammy nods.  &quot;Overprotected&quot; definitely should've won Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance!  Overall, BRITNEY rocks.
B000063DI9|5.0|There was a bit of doubt in my mind when buying this, but seeming as though I'm a huge Maiden fan, I bought it over a Morbid Angel cd I was looking at on the same day. The band needs no introduction, but the musicianship on this cd really stands out above the other cds of the same era. Guitarwise, this is easily the most creative thing that Maiden has ever done, including Powerslave. Dave and Adrian play quite fast, the solos are fantastic and the riffs are leaning to a progressive side of things. They really excelled themselves with this release. The bass is, as always fantastic, but the bass is one of the instruments that really cane past efforts, Steve Harris is just awesome here, he plays extremely fast for a bassist. He also arranged the keyboard pieces for this album and did it quite nicely, they are not too evident, yet they create a nice backdrop for the guitar melodies. Vocally, Bruce is great, lyrically, he's amazing, writing a concept album about the powers of a child associated with the numbers 777 through being the seventh son of a seventh son. His voice is very good here as well. I can't remember too well, but I'm pretty sure it as Nicko on the drums here, they are excellent as well, very precise and impressive.<br />Songwise, the standout tracks would have to extend to the whole album, each and every track has something different and pleasing to offer, the more well known ones being Can I Play With Madness and Clairevoyance. Most of the songs are very epic, such as Infinite dreams and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Others are faster and riff based, such as The Evil That Men Do and Moonchild. I'm just so happy with this album. I listen to this at least once a week and I've had it for several years, I'm pretty sure it was Formulas Fatal to the Flesh that I had to put down for this cd. Lucky, FFttF was a big dissapointment.<br />Easily a 10/10, the seventh (is that a coincidence?) release from Iron Maiden, the original gods of metal. Very Highly recommended, this should be on the top of your list.
0451526295|5.0|As soon as I finished reading Mansfield Park, I quickly had to see the movie, hoping that it would be as great as other Jane Austen movie adaptations.  I was wrong!  None of it compares to this wonderful book.<br />I agree that Fanny Price is not as dynamic or bubbly or as engaging as other Austen heroines, but I do not think her weak or uninteresting.  Why should all Austen heroines be the same?  She has a quiet inner strenth and sensibility that plays off well to her vain aquaintances.  All of her years at Mansfield Park only one person, Edmund, valued her for her true personality and qualities.  Day after day she was made to feel inferior, unworthy and ungrateful by her relations, yet she was none of these things.  I loved when other characters started to appreciate Fanny's good qualities and give her the praise she was due.<br />The other character developments in this novel are wonderful, and I especially like the parts where Henry Crawford is changing and professing his love to Fanny.  Although he is vain and has his faults, I agree with Edmund that it improves Crawford's character by the mere fact that he fell in love with Fanny of all people.  I partly wished that Crawford would fall more into Fanny's good opinion and I regret his ruin in the end.<br />If you are a fan of this book, do not watch the movie adaptation!  Of course there is not enough time for all the great details in the book and it is terrible and completely distorts the story of Mansfield Park .  Fanny is a completely different person in the movie, and it has made me appreciate the real Fanny in the novel even more.  Don't bother with it because if you are a fan of the book the movie will make you angry with the liberties it took.
0743424425|3.0|I don't really get why people think this book is so scary because it really is not.  I had to keep taking breaks and found myself rushing at the end because I was happily almost finished.  In a few sentences, &quot;The Shining&quot; is about this boy, Danny, who has telepathic powers.  Jack, his dad, takes this job as a winter custodian at a haunted Hotel, the Overlook, and he, his wife, Wendy, and son are going to live there for the season.  Then strange, NOT scary things, start happening.<br />I read this book because:<BR>1)  My friend said it was scary and I haven't read a scary book in a LONG time.<BR>2)  I wanted to read the book before seeing Stanley Kubrick's movie.<BR>And now after reading the book:<BR>1)  I'm no longer friends with the person that recommended this (just kidding).<BR>2)  I just watched the movie and it was NOTHING like the book, which was probably a good thing.  Kubricks version was SO much more satisfying as a horror movie than King's so-called horror novel (and from what I've read King hated the film, pfff!).<br />I didn't HATE this book, thus the three stars.  But I was very dissapointed.  &quot;Horror at an unflagging pace&quot; was what one critic says.  B.S.!  I think as a horror novel this book fails because it's SLOW.  The suspense is there, but not the punch.  And nothing really got me.  Too much time was spent on the hedge animals, which weren't scary to begin with.  And I found it VERY hard to believe when one tried to KILL someone.  The whole Masquerade ball was a borefest.  &quot;The elevator's moving!  Oh god!  Let's look inside.  Party streamers and a wine glass!  AHHHHHHH!&quot;  Give me a break.  However, I have to admit that I did find the Woman in 217 and the Man dressed up as a Dog to be scary.  So it wasn't a COMPLETE waste.<br />One thing I notice about King's books is they're very multi-layered.  And you have to be pretty skilled to pull something like he does in here off without confusing the reader, so it proves he'sa good writer, no doubting that.  But the story behind the hotel was very boring.  And the &quot;unraveling&quot; off the Overlook couldn't have been  more uninteresting to me.  And something I notice with King is that when he's &quot;unraveling&quot; the story BEHIND something, it's always found in a scrapbook.  In &quot;The Shining&quot;, Jack finds a white scrapbook with all these newspaper articles following the history and secret of the hotel.  And in &quot;Misery&quot;, another book by King, the story behind Annie is &quot;revealed&quot; through, guess what!, a SCRAPBOOK WITH NEWSPAPER ARTICLES IN THEM.  Which NOW, leads me to how SIMILAR &quot;Misery&quot; is to &quot;The Shining&quot;.  Both about WRITERS trapped in a HOUSE/HOTEL in the WINTER.  And if I were to tell you which of those to read it would definitely be &quot;Misery&quot;, that's if you don't mind reading a boring book within a book (you'll get that once you read &quot;Misery&quot;.)<br />But enough with the King bashing because I have to give him kudos for making such a multi-layered character like Jack Torrance because he is EXTREMELY well written.  He has a lot of stories that make you sympathize with him and you actually like Jack, until he starts trying to, you know, KILL HIS KID AND WIFE.  However all that interesting backstory about his alcoholism, job, and father means NOTHING once we reach the end.  <br />I don't want to go on or else I'm going to give away the ending and stuff, but if you want to read a horror novel that is devoid of horror than I would recommend this one.  However, I'm sure King has scarier books in his repertoire than this.
0345347951|5.0|No one person is the main character of this book.  The main character is the Human race.  Childhood's end challenges the typical views of humans and forces you to think thoughts that have never occured to you.  <BR>How would humanity act while facing a global crisis?<BR>What if Earth's existance owed a &quot;superior&quot; civilization for even living?<BR>What if Mankind could achieve what no other race could?<BR>When will the time of humans come to an end?<br />These deep philisophical questions are what Childhood's End is all about.  Highly recommended.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have listened to every single song on the &quot;Under My Skin&quot; album and I enjoyed them very much. I have Avril's first album &quot;Let Go&quot;, which is one of those albums I could play all the way through without having to skip tracks to get to the one I like, this new album is like that for me as well. I like all of the songs, but I personally enjoyed a song called &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, its very pretty. I think its words are different from the usual guys are jerks-type lyrics. And with that said about the album itself...<BR>I don't feel you have to compromise yourself to anything just because you listen to it. You are listening to the person's voice and to the music, not what the person is like in real life necessarily. I don't think anyone can say for sure what Avril is like or anybody for that matter, unless they actually know them. There are so many regular non-celebrity people out there in the world who are so-called fake, but its hard to point a finger at them because there are so many, but we choose to point out the ones we can, like Avril for example. All I know is that I can appreciate her love for her music/career and her talent as a singer. She has a really great voice. As for style... I wouldn't care if she performed on stage in a burlap sack. Its all about what she brings to her music.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this album is nowhere near as heavy as the previous two. it has more meaning put into the lyrics than others though. a lot of the other reviews on here keep saying this is a lousy album when its actually very good, those reviews were obviously written by unloyal maggots. but if you are looking for a heavy album get the self titled one. and also... if your blaming slipknot for the lack of heaviness in the album.... don't. it was the producer's idea to go less heavy.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|nothing here shows me much Artistic Growth at all.Avril Lavigne is following a Set Formula at appearing a certain way Musically but She doesn't have the Depth as a Musician to pull it off.She reminds me of Alanis&liike Alanis a Image was crafted to sell her a certain way but after a few albums that formula played it's ownself out.the same thing is happening here again.
B000007T1M|3.0|I'm not their biggest fan, but this is a pretty good album. They mix the politics of &quot;Rage Against The Machine&quot;, with a sound that's just as aggressive. The singer also has a unique style, and great range, where one moment he's a screaming maniac, and the next he sings a soft melody. Though it's not the best thing I've ever heard, if you're into the band at all, or the nu-metal scene, this debut of theirs is a must.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is one of the first times I have been moved to write a review. Mainly to debunk all the bad reviews. People say they don't like her because she is &quot;punk.&quot; Get over it. She says she is not. Personally I don't care if she is punk or not because her music awesome:<br />1) Take Me Away - I admit it. The worst song on the CD. The chorus is painful. But it isn't that bad. 2/5<br />2) Together - I heard this is Avril's favorite song on her CD. It is a VERY good song. The lyrics are powerful. 4/5<br />3) Don't Tell Me - Boy if you think this song is good wait until the rest of the album. That's how I thought. It's good but nothing compared to the later songs. 3.5/5<br />4) He Wasn't - a so called sequel to Skater Boy. Fun song. It's been growing on me everytime I listen to it. 3.5/5<br />5) How Does It Feel - the weakest slow song on the CD. May grow on me but right now I skip it. 3/5<br />6) My Happy Ending - Great Great stuff. Glad this is her next single. Will be a bigger hit than Don't Tell Me. 5/5<br />7) Nobody's Home - For the first time Avril sings about someone other than herself and it's great. Really powerful song. Really good song. 5/5<br />8) Forgotten - Wow. She does it yet again. Great song 5/5<br />9) Who Knows - I can't think of anymore good things to say. 4.5/5<br />10) Fall to Pieces - My favorite on the CD. I really hope she releases it as a single. It will be as popular or even more popular than I'm With You. 5/5<br />11) Freak Out - You won't like it at first but it will grow on you. 4/5<br />12) Slipped Away - A very personal song about losing someone. Very Powerful 5/5<br />So buy this CD. Better than Let Go. She seems more free to sing about more personal issues and this CD feels more like her than the other CD. And I don't see any punk. Skater Boy was punk. This CD is most definatly not punk.
B00004X01U|4.0|Not the best from this artist but still delivers on the level of entertainment and material. &quot;Music&quot; is different from other albums in that it has the trance, club, techno vibe that gives you the feeling that you're sitting in the middle of a rave. I say it's decent because while I like a great deal of this, it's also very forgettable. Unilke past Madonna releases, I actually have a hard time remembering some of her tracks and the music here.<br /><br />  Some of the stand-out tracks on this CD are those that didn't get a video treatment and weren't really spoken of until her Drowned World Tour. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is one track that takes Madonna to a new level. Her voice (as it is on many tracks) is digitized, broken down, remixed and makes for a pretty different sound. There's a constant beat that makes it all very danceable. &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; is done in the same manner. While &quot;Music&quot; is impressive, a lot of the tracks seem to blend into one. Little sets them apart from one another or makes them stand-out hits as one would remember 'Like a Virgin' or 'Erotica.'<br />  Another good side of this release is that Madonna still tries to put some meaning and message into her songs. It's not on the level of &quot;Ray of Light&quot; which tries to reach the audience and have them understand the error in their ways and the role they must play as they grow older. That's okay though, because &quot;Music&quot; seems to be made for those looking to have fun and simply enjoy themselves. There are tracks on here that cover a lot of styles, including a blend of techno and folk and country in tracks like 'I Deserve It,''Gone' and 'Nobody's Perfect.' What's fun about it is that Madonna ends on a note about staying true to herself and her work, leading creatively into her next release of &quot;American Life&quot; where she talks about her personal life and the problems that comes with being famous.<br />  &quot;Music&quot; is good. I wouldn't say it's as impressive as her other releases but on the level of creativity and re-inventing herself and her music, it's a successful and great attempt. For some reason though, &quot;Music&quot; and many of the tracks don't remain with me as a listener and that may be the same for others who are used to Madonna's earlier works. Still, it is worth the money and place in your collection.t say it's as impressive as her other releases but on the level of creativity and re-inventing herself and her music, it's a successful and great attempt.

B0001AVZA8|5.0|Harry Sanborn drives to the home of his latest lady under thirty. He plans to spend the weekend alone with Marin, until her mother and aunt arrive unexpetedly.  Erica Barry is astonished that her daughter is dating Sanborn, but doesn't make him leave.  <br />Just as Harry (played by Jack Nicholson)starts kissing Marin,(played by Amanda Peet) he has a heart attack.  Erica performs CPR until the medics arrive. Harry thinks he is ready to leave the hospital, but becomes dizzy and faints. Keanu Reeves plays Dr. Mercer, who orders Harry to stay nearby for a few days. He ends up staying with Erica for a few days.  Erica is a famous playwright played by Diane Keaton.  She has writer's block at first, but she begins to be inspired by her experience with Harry and starts writing a play. In the meantime, she discovers herself having feelings that she thought were over a long time. The heart attack saved two lives, not one.<BR>This story is a beautifully written romantic comedy by Nancy Myers. I recommend it to an adult audience.  The acting was brilliant!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I thought &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; was gonna be the weakest song on the album but I was wrong most of the song's are realy not good,many song's sound worse then &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; the only song that is decent is &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; other then that this CD is dissapointing considering this is her follow up from her great &quot;Let Go&quot; album!<br />This album was a waist of money!
B00005MP58|3.0|This miniseries stays very close to the plot of the famous Jane Austen novel without ever managing to really catch its spirit.  The book is much funnier and livelier than this version leads you to believe.<br />The sets and costumes are very nice and very well photographed, and most of the cast is very good.  Colin Firth is an exception.  He is nothing like Mr. Darcy in the book and he can't act his way out of a paper bag.  I have to deduct two stars due to his performance alone.
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|For me, the great CD of the h era is \\"Afraid Of Sunlight\\", but this CD is pretty special too. I was never a fan of \\"Brave\\" because of its inherent lack of tunefulness and when I started to hear comparisions between \\"Brave\\" and \\"Marbles\\", I was somewhat dismayed, thinking \\"Like Brave? Oh no. All those twiddly noodling tracks between too few good tunes. Say it ain't so.\\"<br /><br />But luckily, my dismay was misplaced.<br /><br />The reason that I don't give this five stars is there are still  noodling tracks in here and they are Marbles I-IV. Now, they ARE \\"Brave-like\\", not too tuneful, over too quickly and quite irritating.<br /><br />The good thing I can say is that they are short and give us more time for some really great tracks like \\"Fantastic Place\\", \\"Angelina\\" and the real standout \\"Ocean Cloud\\". Not too sure about one of the other reviewers here who's complaining about the lyrics, especially of \\"Ocean Cloud\\" - that track is simply worth the price of the CD.<br /><br />I also have to agree with other reviewers who say the opening track \\"The Invisible Man\\" seems a little incoherent - like it's a number of unrelated songs cobbled together to make a long \\"epic\\". But that being said, it's still not bad. There are no bad tracks here for me, except of course the aforementioned noodlers that are \\"Marbles I-IV\\". It took me a long time to get listen to the second CD because I kept on replaying the first one.<br /><br />Yes, it is that good.<br /><br />I have also gone back to listening to those CDs that most of the reviewers here ( including myself ) find the most disappointing - \\"Radiation\\" and \\".com\\". They are growing on me, but \\"Costa del Slough\\" still remains the worst track they EVER recorded<br /><br />\\"Anoraknophobia\\" I always liked - I saw them live in Cologne for the tour promoting that CD and they kicked proverbial you-know-what - Steve Rothery was just outstanding live.<br /><br />I have \\"Brave\\" in the car CD changer, but, sorry, it still leaves me cold. There is no way that \\"Brave\\" can hold a candle to either \\"Marbles\\" or another great effort of the h era, \\"This Strange Engine\\".<br /><br />If you get the chance to hear \\"Man Of A Thousand Faces\\" live, whatever you do, DON'T PASS IT UP.<br /><br />I am a fan from \\"Script For a Jester's Tear\\" and still a big fan of Fish too. His solo work is also well worth checking out.<br /><br />Right now I would rank the h CDs as :-<br /><br />1. Afraid Of Sunlight<br />2. Marbles<br />3. The Strange Engine<br />4. Seasons End<br />5. Anoraknophobia<br />6. marillion.com<br />7. Holidays In Eden<br />8. Brave<br />9. Radiation<br /><br />After listening to \\".com\\" some more, I have revised my previous order of the CD's. \\".com\\" has \\"Interior Lulu\\" on it!or another great effort of the h era, \\"This Strange Engine\\".    If you get the chance to hear \\"Man Of A Thousand Faces\\" live, whatever you do, DON'T PASS IT UP.    I am a fan from \\"Script For a Jester's Tear\\" and still a big fan of Fish too.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|I haven't been much of a slipknot fan... I mean yeah I liked maybe 1 or 2 of their songs before this came out. I didnt care for them that much because all their stuff started sounding the same. But this album blew me away. Normally their screaming just goes on and on, but in this case they sing really well and still have the screaming in there and it works. The guitar and bass is just awsome and the drums are unbeleivable. What really suprised me is that there are acustic songs on here...and they kick ass. So the bottom line is if you like slipknot buy this album... it still has their old stuff, along with some welcome new stuff. And if you dont like Slipknot, buy this album anyway because you'll like it even though it is Slipknot. this album is also good for when your pissed off at the world,in violent fast mood, just wanna chill out, or if you just wanna pound your head in with some music.
0060922583|5.0|One evening years ago while listening to Public Radio, Mr. Talbot was interviewed about his book and I sat and listened transfixed to what he had to say.  The story that most stuck in my mind was the story of the hypnotism of a man where the hypnotist stood behind a subject with a watch and asked the gentleman to tell him what he had in his hand and the man told him he had a watch.  I immediately went out and bought this book and though it's in the science section, it may very well be in the paranormal section.  An interesting and intriguing read!  Highly recommended for concepts such as the paranormal and the brain's power to heal the body and mind.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Fast action, terrific photography, great period atmosphere, colorful characters and a first-rate rock soundtrack add up to a true drive-in classic that retains its &quot;cult classic&quot; reputation even after more than 30 years. <br />This DVD includes BOTH the 97-minute U.S. print typically seen on cable and video AND the 105-minute U.K. version which  includes a couple of flashbacks featuring Charlotte Rampling that for some reason were completely excised for U.S. release.  The excised scenes add just a tad more insight into Kowalski's character; while not essential to the whole plot (such as it is), these scenes ARE interesting and definitely will be appreciated by hardcore fans of the film.  Kudos to 20th Century Fox for making available both versions.  Being a real fan of the era that this movie was shot in, it's a kick to hear director Richard C. Sarafian's commentary track.  Highly recommended!
B0000D96NW|5.0|Being a progressive heavy metal fan, I was hesitant to purchase this album, but after hearing the song Imperium, I was blown away with the level of musicianship. The production and sound quality were also excellent. The lyrical content is introspective and deep, although the vocal styling is hard to discern without the assistance of the lyric sheet, the ferocity is hard to miss. The introduction of melodicism in the vocal at times proves that Machine Head is not pigeon holed in to a overdone genre.  The arrangement skills of this band are formidable. The groove is an absolute thing of beauty at times, and the powerful wall of sound is sheer sonic bliss!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This was an awesome CD although many songs did not live up to my expectations from IOWA. I think if this would have been released before IOWA then it would be much better. I dont think anything could top IOWA. Overall i give this Cd a 4 out of 5 stars
B000068CNX|5.0|People can say whatever they want about Friends, but it will always be one of the best sitcoms and this will always be one of the best seasons. Most of the big storylines in this season are about ross and rachel, of course, but this was before the storyline got dragged out into a big dramatic soap opera. The prom video episode alone gives the season 5 Stars in my book [esp. pheeb's lobster comparison!]. But the other characters are still hilarious; Monica's relationship with her father's friend brings laughs, Joey's Days of our Lives stint, meeting Phoebe's husband and learning about the Old Yeller incident, and Chandler being Chandler. GREAT!
6305252572|5.0|Some of the best 1-liners ever reside in this film.  Simply put, its a great comedy with a flare for drama, and in the cop buddy genre.  Lots of cursing, some nudity, but ultimately, a great flick.  It kicks today's cop buddy flicks in the Mother F-ing Aholes Mother F-ers!
0802130208|5.0|Loved this book!  It is so funny.  This book should have a cult following.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|As true as it is that Slipknot are brutally heavy, there comes a time when even the heaviest of bands has to evolve. Whether it be melody (like Amorphis), slower tempos (like Slayer), power ballads (like Testament), or acoustic tunes (Black Sabbath), it's good to see a band evolve. I don't, however, completely agree with what singer Corey said on Headbanger's Ball a week ago. He said: &quot;Iff you can't evolve, then ffffffft! We don't want ya!&quot; I don't think it's necessary for every band to evolve to be great. Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dimmu Borgir, they never really evolved. Plus sometimes, evolving makes you bad (Metallica, anyone?).<br />Well, anyway, let's get to the point. This album is very well rounded. It contains many pieces in the tradition of Slipknot's style: fast and punishingly heavy. However, there are some acoustic ballads on this record. Some may be outraged. Some may enjoy them a lot. But overall, it shows that even a band as nutty as Slipknot can evolve. Also, the new look is very cool. The basics of the look are the same: 9 masked men in solid colored jumpsuits. But the masks look much more realistic than they did in previous albums. So if you thought these guys were all about making noise, you were WRONG!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|When i first bought this cd i assumed that it would be something like the song duality and pulse of the maggots from hearing them.  This cd has some of the worst songs yet with the exeption of a few, duality was the best one on there.  So if you didnt like that song dont expect anything from this cd.  The vocals sounded like hanson was in on some of them.  I think that slipknot is heading more towards a nickelback sound.  If you want to hear a great slipknot cd go out and get the self titled one.<br />Another problem that i had with this cd was that the tracks that actually sounded like metal had no personality and edge like slipknot is known for.
1577311523|5.0|BEFORE ANY REVIEW ON MY PART I MUST SAY..IF YOU ARE EVEN CONTEMPLATING GETTING THIS BOOK...DON'T THINK ANOTHER THOUGHT..GET IT.  <BR>I bought this book on CD after it picked me (I reluctantly agreed). Never before have I encountered any information base that has made such a profound transformation in my ability to experience daily joy. I want to shout it from the roof tops. I want everyone to know how simple it is to come alive and shed the constant negative self talk (what an enormous waste of energy). If this were taught to children early on it might just save our species from self destruction. I listen to my cd's daily and wish I could convince everyone I meet to experience the power of this information. It truly breaks down all complications into an almost stupid simple relief. This is knowledge we have flowing within that is easy to recognize if given our full attention. ECKHART TOLLE HAS ACCEPTED THE CALL OF THE POWERFUL SPIRIT OF UNIVERSAL LOVE (GOD) TO HELP TIP THE SCALES AND PULL THE WHOLE OF THE HUMAN RACE OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF SEPARATENESS AND ALL THAT THAT IMPLIES. THANK GOD!
B000094FGO|4.0|I think some of the people writing reviews need to learn a thing or two about music.  I've seen all this stuff about Lacuna Coil clonage... because it's a similar style doesn't make it a clone.  Nor is it incredible that they write their own music.  However, there are things customers should know about the album, things that have nothing to do with hype or other bands.  <br />The majority of the songs tend to sound similar.  By that I mean stylistically, the songs are largely repetitive, although this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Amy Lee's voice is highly overrated, but it isn't horrible or grating (except for her performance on Jay Leno... THAT was horrendous), just not the spectacular gothic sound people seem to think she uses.  It is true that the guitar parts tend to be a bit unimaginative... for better, go check out Nightwish or Lacuna Coil.  They are better bands.  Now, about the songs themselves.  You've heard Bring Me To Life and Going Under.  That's what most of it sounds like.  The gems are My Immortal and Haunted.  My Immortal was RUINED by putting guitars and changing the strings.  I believe Ben left the band because of the decision to make that a single... it was about Amy and Ben and their relationship (read the lyrics book and the thank yous), and shouldn't have been released.  Haunted is named for the sound of the song.  No preconceptions here, folks, listen to it, love it.  Imaginary isn't bad either, nor is the string solo before it.  For GOOD Evanescence, look up Origin online... Amy suggested downloading it in an interview.  If you can find &quot;You&quot; online, download it, but good luck... she ordered all of it off the internet.  Happy hunting!
B00005QXDD|5.0|This cd is one of the greatest cds I have ever had the priveledge to listen to. I love this cd. Jack Black is just talented when it comes to singing and stuff. See I cant even say how much I like this cd. Words cant express it. My favorite song is probably Karate Schnizel. Or at least I think it is. There is so many good songs to choose from I havent really made up my mind. Well my advice to everyone is to buy this cd. It will really make your day better than it was five minutes ago when you didnt have the cd.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Hey listen, Im a big Pink Floyd. So here it goes, Ok Computer is the greatest album made in the 90's, period! But OK computer is no Dark Side of the Moon. The album hasnt sold 30million copies, hasnt spent 11 consecutive years on the charts. The impact Dark Side has made cant be match. Dark Side isnt there greatest album but there 3 greatest. Ok Computer is a hell of an album that you should buy or at least listen to it. Will it have the same impact has Dark Side of the Moon? When you talk about Radiohead, OK Computer alwasy comes up. Has it made an impact in the music like Dark Side, NO. People still listen and try to make music like Pink FLoyd, Led, Rolling, etc. But there is only one Dark Side and Ok Computer is not even a top great album ever made. You can put Dark Side and  THe WAll in the top 20albums ever made. OK close to 35 or 40. NOT BETTER and WILL not HAVE THE IMPACT OF DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. People talk about Dark Side 30yrs later, Ok was just a 90's flavor. NO more!
B00008S2VG|1.0|What in heavens name is madonna trying to accomplish with this half-baked garbage? This is a mess of an album, uninspired, poorly executed, outdated in every aspect--musically. Lyrically, madonna seems to have no direction. It's one stinkbomb song after the next. She hasn't grown as a singer since the 80's. She's just got a busload of writers and expert music mixers and programmers to help her try to stay relevant. and of course she's trying to take the lions share of the credit. Now you know when the actual writing gets put into her hands what the outcome will be. madonna doesn't know the first thing about proper lyricism, nor can she sing. A rat has a better vocal range
6300214435|2.0|Watch this movie if you want to pass an afternoon with a bland movie. Kate Capshaw is a great actress but her character was very annoying. Karen Black's strong female lead in 'Raiders' is by far the better of the female leads from the trilogy.
0743455967|5.0|One of the key questions to ask a reader is how he feels about Stephen King.  If he dismisses him out of hand - \\"No, I've never actually READ anything by him, but I've seen the movies,\\" - I know the guy isn't worth his salt.  Stephen King - along with Elmore Leonard - is one of the best craftsmen of fiction alive.  MANY authors higher up the food chain would do well from taking some lessons from him.<br />Now they can.   In On Writing, Stephen King gives us what advice he can on the subject of writing fiction.  The problem with many creative writing books is that they are not nuts-and-bolts enough; they provide esoteric clichés like \\"write what you know.\\"  Stephen King cuts to the practical matters, like follow Strunk &amp; White and avoid adverbs.<br />The book is half advice on creative writers and half autobiography.  The autobiography is germane because we want to know how the most successful author of modern times got his start.  Here we see a man who PAID HIS DUES.  I've read this book three times now and I may do so again - I find it endlessly useful.  If you can, get the audiobook; it is narrated by King himself and much more of his personality comes across.
B0001Z363W|4.0|thsi cd is a very good cd.  for those of you who say this cd sucks and what not because its soft are obviously not true fans of black label society. I listen to this cd as much as i do any other black label cd.
B00008WG3U|1.0|This album sucks compared to other NOFX records, I have been listening to NOFX for about ten years, and this is a disappointment.  I wish Fat Mike would spend more time writing new songs and less time being an politician.  Frankly, I think the only reason most people like this record is because it bashes Bush.  If you want to make a political statement, you should just donate your $12 to a candidate and listen to older (better) NOFX records. If you want a generic record, this is it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I never thought Avril could top her first album, but this cd rocks.  I like every song on it!!!  They each of different themes- so everyone can relate to it- Avril's voice is still awsome, the music and the lyrics go great together... I would definently suggest buying this album... it's way bettter then the first, Avril did a great job!
B00006GJ9F|5.0|ha ha i cant believe some people actually paid 45 dollars for this CD thats nuts i burned this whole CD and the last track wasnt japenese so to the losers that paid 45 dollars for this great but expensive album to bad so sad :P
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is great. There are so many movies out and this movie is completely original. It just introduces so many weird things, yet never loses the viewers attention.<br />I didn't want to miss one part of the movie as it was so interesting. Why is it so interesting though? You haven't seen it before. You don't know what might happen because there are so many new things to see. Also, the movie brilliantly masks this dark atmosphere. Spectre looks beautiful, but is really creepy at the same time. Almost everything feels a little eery.<br />This movie doesn't really have a plot. It doesn't need a plot though. It tells the life of this guy who tells stories. The end is also brilliant because although the movie doesn't really have a plot, it does have a conclusion. Lost in Translation didn't have a plot and didn't have a conclusion and that doesn't work at all. Just look at all the reviews for it.<br />This movie is tremendous. I can't describe how great it is. You just have to see it and be entertained for two hours.
B00012QM8G|1.0|ok the film gets 5 stars, its spielburgs best film but wot the f*k is with the dvd. im sorry but i believe lord of the ring the return of the king was on one dvd, but this is just as long as it and its black and white!!! so why cant this be put on one dvd. shamfull!
B00020HEG6|5.0|What can I say?  It's JOHN WILLIAMS!  He's a musical genius, but this soundtrack is at the top of his compositions.  Trust me... you'll love it.  Even those who tend to hate anything without lyrics will love it!
0446530891|1.0|I've read Absolute Power, Saving Faith and now this. AP and SF each started out good then turned ludicrous. SS was just plain boring from the get. DB's stories have no depth to em.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee Olstead is the real deal!  Who knew this sitcom star (&quot;Still Standing&quot;) had such a great voice.  This new singer takes a collection of great standards, intermixed with a couple of newbies, and makes them her own.  She's a pop singer with a jazz sensibility that is absolutely intoxicating. One can only hope that her record company will promote her as well as Norah Jones was promoted by her label. This is a fresh take on titles from the Great American Songbook, with arrangements that match.<BR>Her duet with Peter Cincotti on &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard To Do&quot; is worth the price of the CD all on its own!  A wistfully done &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me&quot; is equally great. Listen to her rendition of the Barry Manilow song &quot;Meet Me, Midnight&quot;, and tell me that you aren't hearing a new singing star being born!<BR>This is one terrific CD!
B00003CXCT|1.0|These are the dreaded Special Editions.  Why not simply make the discs double sided?  One side SE, one original, with cleaned up picture and sound.<br />I compare this to the restoration of Michelangelo's David.  They simply cleaned him, removing dirt and restoring him to his original glory.<br />They didn't decide David would look better with armor or a nifty new sword.  It might look great, but it's not David.<br />My problem with the major changes are simply that they look awful. i.e. Greedo shooting first.  Besides the fact that it changes Han Solo's character and makes no sense; really how do you miss shooting at somebody 3 feet away?  It looks bizarre.  Han's head jumps in the completely unnatural fashion that makes it looks like he can willingly dislocate his spine.  <br />Rumor has it, the SFX guys did it awful on purpose in hoping Lucas wouldn't use it after seeing how phony it looked.  Well he did.<br />The Jabba scene is pretty bad.  He looks totally unrealistic, like something out of a Nintendo game.  Han \\"stepping on Jabba's tail\\" is a poor cut n' paste job to get around the fact that original Jabba was a humanoid creature, and not a giant slug.<br />Also, why does Luke scream now after falling in Empire?  In the original, he can't bear to live with the fact that Darth Vader is his father, and deliberately let go of the railing, rather than be Vader's son.  Why would he scream when he CHOSE to fall?<br />What's even more bizarre is what they DIDN'T fix.  The Rancor still looks horrible.
B000148KK2|1.0|I just don't understand how Diana could put out an album like this. She has now become my poster child for LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY.<BR>I was especially upset that someone of her stature in the music world would title one of her cuts &quot;Temptation&quot;. That title was already taken, many years ago. I imagine that this was the hook that got a lot of fans of her previous albums to spring for this one.  Well this CD is now a coaster or maybe a frisby.
B000003MZU|5.0|It is not easy for an album to garner so many awards and recognition, but Juan Luis Guerra's 'Bachata Rosa' changed Latin music so much that it deserves every single one of them.<br />If you only considered that the album is 100% danceable with its catchy tunes (&quot;Rosalia,&quot; &quot;Carta De Amor,&quot; &quot;A Pedir Su Mano,&quot; &quot;La Bilirrubina&quot;), its clever lyrics that still make songs easy to sing along and be merry or fall in love to (such as the case with &quot;Como Abeja Al Panal&quot;, &quot;Estrelliatas Y Duendes&quot;, &quot;Burbujas De Amor&quot; and the title track), you could say that the album is brilliant already.<br />But if you go beyond that, and realize that the album brought about a transformation to Merengue and Latin music at large, by bringing Bachata (a sort of tropical ballad) to the forefront of collective awareness, you start to realize that the giant from Dominican Republic (Juan Luis Guerra, in case you're wondering) is no average musician, but close to a musical genius. 'Bachata Rosa' stops being your album of typical Merengue music, and takes on a level of brilliance that is not common.<br />Do yourself a favor, and begin your Juan Luis Guerra collection here.
B00000JGEH|5.0|Dont waste your time with the DVD.... this version is much better...soundwise anyways.....
B00006879E|1.0|I am so sick of hearing this crap every time I turn on the radio.  The song &quot;this love&quot; gets played like a million times a day and it is annoying.  I guess there are alot of requests from morons who like this kind of crap.
B00005N5S5|3.0|I am very dissapointed with the sound in this DVD, I own the VHS version of this movie and the sound on that is much better. Theres a scene where Arnold goes to the 1st Sarah Conners house, when he puts the red dot on her forehead and shoots, the gun sounds like a cap gun. In the VHS version it sounds like a cannon....wow, what a waste...this is the reason DVD is not all its cracked up to be....i will stick with the VHS version just for the soundtrack... way better than this crap.
B00004RFFI|1.0|Lord love you, what a lousy film!  This must be on the short list of the worst American  films of the 1990's; and the more money and special effects they threw at the moronic script the worse it got.  Helen Hunt was so great in her TV show \\"Mad About You\\" that the public was apparently ready to cut her a lot of slack, and she used it all in this stinker.  A production of Steven Spielberg's dim-witted associates, it's basically \\"Jaws,\\" only with a tornado instead of a shark.  Not a single believable scene, word of dialogue, or point of contact with the real world of meteorology.  Beware.

B0000DD7LB|3.0|Considering I am not a fan of Pop or Britney Spears this review maybe somewhat bias when it comes to Spears's new record, &quot;In The Zone&quot;. However, I am not fully complaining, Spears has an array of songs which definitley save the album from being &quot;Just another Pop album&quot;. The album title is taken from a lyric from the song &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;. This song is a great Pop song, thanks in large part to Madonna's vocal addition. Anything these two sexy Divas work on together is sure to be intriguing and sexy and that's exctly what this song is. Specific album highlights for me are: &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot;, &quot;Everytime&quot;, and &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;. Now with an album with twelve tracks and one remix I can only bare to listen to five of them. Major let downs to this album are songs, &quot;Early Mornin'&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot; and &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;. Spears's is seemingly trying a little too hard to become that woman she declares to be. This album is darker and more mature than it's predecessors but I think Brintey Spears has yet to release her best work.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|With her 2002 debut album, &quot;Let Go,&quot; singer Avril Lavigne set herself as the &quot;Anti-Britney&quot; of her generation, posing as a songwriter/musician - the truth: she does not play the guitar, nor did she write the album entirely (she had more than enough help writing her first music effort with the help of skilled music producers and writers - the Matrix). Despite the false image this teen rocker set for her teen audience, the genuine message empowered young girls (considering the album sold five million records). The ingredients that made Britney Spears the pop icon she is today have worked in Avril's favor - she knows what to present herself to be against. With the help of talented writers and musicians that can actually play the drums and the guitar, Avril successfully makes a new record that will do well in pop mainstream. The effort disgused as a punk record is nothing more than manufactured punk, which is a million times worse than manufactured pop.<br />Two years later, the Canadian pop star tries the same forumula with an anthem for the practice of abstinence, &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; the new single from Lavigne's new album &quot;Under My Skin.&quot; In spite of the positive message, this track compares nothing to 2002's catchy debut single &quot;Complicated,&quot; which topped the charts worldwide around the time of its release. <br />The album itself expresses heartfelt cliche lyrics on not-so-touchy, very general topics. The highlights on this record include 'How Does it Feel?,&quot; &quot;My Happy Ending,&quot; and &quot;Forgotten&quot; - and it's not because of her 'songwriting.' Lavigne slides through this record on the music itself, the catchy beats, and her strong vocals. But she fails to say anything we haven't already heard.<br />&quot;Under My Skin&quot; could've been unreleased songs from &quot;Let Go&quot; for all we know - the album could've been titled &quot;Let Go Pt 2.&quot; The album shows no growth for Avril as an artist. But of course, nobody can deny her raw talent.
B00000DGUG|5.0|After three years of the release of the ever successful, Jagged Little Pill, Alanis Morissette finally released her sophmore album, &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;. What's distintcly different about this album and it's predessor? How about a much more softer and not-so-angry toned Morissette, musical influences from India, and a new sense of spirituality. This record is considered Morissette's &quot;F#@&amp; you&quot; record to the industry, because she literally defies all common recording industry rules. From the very beginiing of this record you'll sense a new peace in Morissette thanks to &quot;Front Row&quot; (a song whose verses are derived from conversations) and the guitar whirling &quot;Baba&quot; (a song that questions people's personal motives in religion). Thank U (the first single from the record) is Alanis Morissette's declaration of thankfulness for the expiriences she has lived and accepting the good and bad in her life. This album is packed with 17 songs which (for the casual listener) maybe hard to digest. &quot;Joining You&quot;, &quot;Sympathetic Character&quot;, &quot;Would Not Come&quot;, and &quot;Can't Not&quot;) are all angry songs that are reminiscent of Jagged Little Pill. However songs like: &quot;So Pure&quot;, &quot;The Couch&quot;, &quot;UR&quot;, &quot;Unsent&quot;, and &quot;One&quot; reveal Alanis's new expirimental style. I would never reccommend this album to the casual Alanis Morissette listener, but it is definitley a treasure among rocks.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|This new cd is the goods. I mean everyone keeps calling her a pile of loaf, but she is really good.  I saw her on SNL and the Today show and she can really play the guitar!! Her fingers were pushing down on the wire thingies on the guitar and moving around.  I think she is as good as any rocker on guitar, just give her a chance. Her singing is NOT out of tune live, she sings that way on purpose to sound different.  It is only out of tune if it is not done purposely.  I can't wait till her next CD, it is supposed to be all goth and black sabbath kinda stuff.
068983571X|5.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has created perhaps the best detective in Sherlock Holmes.  \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is narrated by the faithful Watson, a man of genius not quite on par with that of Holmes, the master mystery solver.  Holmes is forever quizzing Watson to see things the way he does, to figure out the mysteries of small things, like a walking stick left behind by a visitor.<br />\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" tells the story of Henry Baskerville, a man who has inherited his family's home and fortune (as the supposed final heir), but also their apparent curse.  His uncle was recently found dead on the grounds of Baskerville Hall, with little explanation for his death.  The locals are sure as to the cause; it is the mysterious hell-hound that haunts the moors that was the cause of his death.  The local doctor brings the matter to Holmes and Watson and they are charged to protect the young Henry Baskerville from a similar fate, as well as to solve the mystery of the hound.<br />While trying to gather facts for his intrepid employer, the faithful Watson narrates the strange happenings among Sir Henry's neighbors, wanting to add his own theories, but leaving the mystery solving to his much-admired mentor.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle writes a well-paced narrative that builds to a climax that is still exciting even when we know the real mystery behind the hound.  At the end, it is Holmes and not his faithful sidekick Watson, who reveals the tricks of his trade and how he solved the mystery that no one ever suspected.  Doyle has created a wonderful pair of complementary characters in Holmes and Watson and it is a joy to read their adventures.
B00004YMRZ|3.0|There was absouletly no reason to change any part of the original bladerunner,i happen to like the narration, it adds that old film noir touch, its not &quot;LUDICROUS&quot;, it adds an extra level of depth and meaning, sure with the narration gone you can hear more of the background sounds and voices,without it, you miss a lot great lines, especially what is said on the roof top by 'deckard',as roy batty is dying. And to to these who think the original ending is uplifting, maybe you should check to see if you have a brain at all!. &quot;THE ENDING IS AMBIGUOUS&quot; ,as is there fate?. I will always love the (1982) version the best, it was perfect then, why  wreck an excellent movie because the director , did not have the  guts to stand up for the movie he wanted back in 1982.Now all you can get on dvd, is this bastardized copy, i can only hope that i can find the the original dvd someday. thanks for nothing ridley scott.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|D12's first album, DEVIL'S NIGHT, just gave critics a reason to say &quot;All rap posse albums are lame.&quot; While the beats were good, the members of D12 got by on lyrics ranging from average to just idiotic. Except for Eminem, of course. The &quot;leader of the band&quot; showed a major progress in both lyrics and flow on DEVIL'S NIGHT, sounding more confident (and psychotic) than ever. On D12 WORLD, Shady's crew step their game up like Em did then. The result is a consistently engaging work.<br />From the opening track, &quot;Git Up,&quot; the Dirty Dozen let you know this isn't &quot;Devil's Night 2.&quot; D12 WORLD comes through on the promise that DEVIL'S NIGHT broke - it helps the listener put a face on each member(Besides Eminem, i only knew Bizarre because he rapped about, um, &quot;unusual&quot; things). Originally, i heard &quot;40 Oz.&quot; and hated it. I thought D12 had sold out to the &quot;Lil Jon get crunk&quot; club type crap. Now I really like it, especially the chorus and Eminem's verse. <br />It was great that they got a verse from Bugz on the CD, since he can't be along for the ride today. His lyrics are nice, and although he keeps the same, slightly annoying flow the whole track, it was still a good inclusion. &quot;How Come,&quot; &quot;Leave That Boy Alone,&quot; and &quot;Get My Gun&quot; are probably my 3 favorite songs on the album, and they're conveniently placed right next to each other in the sequencing. &quot;Get My Gun&quot; is especially hilarious - Eminem loads up his pistol, preparing to shoot a guy who only asked him for an autograph, while Kon Artis frantically tries to talk him out of it. The title track is also notable: Kanye West contributes an Indian-style beat that brings out some of the best rhymes on the album.<br />Expect to hear D12 WORLD at parties all summer long. And expect to be blown away, one way or another, when you put this in your CD player.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When Slipknot remade My Plague for the Resident Evil soundtrack, I was pissed, to put it simply. I felt they did it to appeal more to the mainstream audience as opposed to fitting the soundtrack of the movie better.<br />When I heard Duality, sure it was a great song, but very, very mainstream appropriate. Kinda pissed me off too and enforced my set-in-stone opinion that this new Slipknot would be just like that too.<br />Well, I was wrong.<br />How can people say this album is light?? It's probably the heaviest stuff they have done, aside from the two awesome acoustic songs (seriously, Vermilion, Part 2 makes me want to cry), there is so much more here than ever. The screaming is great, the lyrics are damn good and have more meaning, especially with the lack of cursing (which may turn off fans that liked the cursing to enforce brutality- trust me, there's still brutality in absence of cursing.) It's great to hear them change from what they were to what they are, and there's even solos on the album, backed by the AMAZING drumming of Joey Jordison- seriously, the man is a genious behind the set.<br />Pick this up, don't even question.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|My god! I hate Avril! She is so fake! I mean se denies that she is &quot;Punk&quot; and yet she wears a &quot;Kiss me Im punk&quot; pin and she is always in picsturs trying to look the part.  Also she is not a nice person.  She hates all her preppy fans.  Go listen to good music like CKY or The Distillers.
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movie has been an old family favourite for as long as I can remember - well since 1986 at least! If you're not too good with complex storylines, &quot;re-LAX&quot; :) This story line is about as simple as writing your own name - a kid and his mates take the day off from school. With that unravels a series of HALARIOUS sequences, and for Formulae 1 fans - there's a Firarri! The most amusing aspect of the film in my opinion, is probably the facial expressions - they are FANTASTIC! And the one-liners are classic - beeting the tooshes off these other so-called comedies. Yeah, it's alot of fun, a lot of mischief and alot of laughs - a great night in! &quot;OOooh YEEEAH&quot;! :)
B000002G23|5.0|well the first time that i had listened to the police was on the radio( the message in a bottle song) and it was great , i then bought the greatest hit cd but it still was too little, i had a hard time looking for this boxset but i finally got it last week and it;s the greatest thing, every single song . buy this boxset and the police live cd and u don't need anything else
6305127689|5.0|good soundtrack, awesome actors, classic lines, exciting flying sequences and just all-round fun makes &quot;Top Gun&quot; one the true classics of the 80's movie era. In the time of Terminator, Rocky, and the other greats, &quot;Top Gun&quot; is another one of that category. Just a good 'ol fun 2 hours - a good way (escpecially in today's stance) to let loose, laugh, cry and wonder.<br />a great film. :)
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne came on the scene shouting that she was different.  That she hated all pop-icons and that she was as &quot;punk&quot; as they come.<br />Yeah, sure.<br />Anyway, her first album was a pathetic attempt at proving to everyone that you CAN write a song called Sk8ter Boi and still be punk.  Turns out you can't though.  Her music was flat, obviously written by someone else, and lacking effort in the  emotional department.<br />With her new album she tries to be what Liz Phair used to be, an indie princess.  Someone who can mix mainstream music with Indie's musical intensity and simplicity.  And now Phair is 'extraordinary' on the radio 24/7.  Not the best person to be your role model...<br />Lavigne, not quite ready enough to call her music art, tries to force an artistic album down the throats of her fans.  Songs sound misguided and almost self absorbed.  Her theme for this album is the same one we've seen from all pop-icons recently.  Christina did Stripped.  Britney In The Zone.  All about them &quot;finally&quot; getting the chance to be &quot;themselves&quot; and play and sing the music they've been wanting to for oh, so long.  Lavigne says that she hates their image yet follows in their footsteps so eagerly that her album is a more 'rock' verson of any Pop album out right now.<br />I recommend this album if you have no taste in music.  If you want to listen to something good pick up a Radiohead album and don't waste your time with this Canadian loser.
B000066NW0|5.0|I say this album isn't as good as Under My Skin, but I stil lthink she put out the best album she was able to do back then.<br />1. Losing Grip-This song is really cool, I love it. Great opneing song. 10/10<BR>2.Complicated-The radio played this too much but it's still a good song. 9/10<BR>3.Sk8er Boi- I used to love this song, now it's stil ok, but not my favorite. 9/10<BR>4.I'm With You- Such a great song. It's a heart touching ballad. 10/10<BR>5.Mobile- Probably my least favorite track.8/10<br />6.Unwanted- Avril's faovrite track.  It's so cool. 10/10<BR>7.Tomorrow- LOVE IT! 10/10<BR>8.Anything But Ordinary-Yes that's what you are Avril. 9/10<BR>9. Thing's I'll Never Say- This is an awesome song. 10/10<BR>10. My World- This is a great song to sing if you live in a small town. 9/10<BR>11.Nobody's Fool- I'm surprised, if Avril had wnated to, she would've been a pretty good rapper. 10/10<BR>12. Too Much To Ask- One of my favorites. 10/10<BR>13. Naked- Good closing to good album. 10/10<br />126/130=5 stars
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ok, so I'm one of those people who are anti-&quot;X-tina.&quot; I mean, I just dislike her whole image and how she puts herself out there. Many would agree with me when I say she's whorish. But with that stunt she displays, she has a breathtakingly talented voice for a pop artist. I absolutely loved the CD. It's exactly the opposite of what I imagined her to make. I never like songs with cliche words but this girl's defiently done her part. My favorites are &quot;Infatuation,&quot; &quot;Walk Away,&quot; and &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours.&quot; They are such amazing tunes and I just can't stop humming them. Totally get this CD, you won't be dissapointed.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off I would like to say that everyone should buy this album!!!It shows that their is a much wider spectrum of Slipknot than people had precieved.  Yet their are some injustices I would like to bring into light.<br />1)For those of you who consider yourselves &quot;true&quot; fans of Slipknot and bash this CD because it isn't hard enough, you should hold your heads in shame.  Rick Rubin had put it best when he said  &quot;What I tried to stress from the beginning is that Slipknot is a bigger idea than a sound,&quot; Rubin said. &quot;They can't be limited by what they think Slipknot is supposed to sound like. What draws people to Slipknot is how extreme it is. But extreme doesn't have to always be extreme in the same way. Sometimes extreme can be fast; sometimes extreme can be slow. Extreme could mean extreme musically&quot;(taken from an interview conducted by MTV.)So basically even the slow can be extreme and blow you away.Just listen to the Lyrics! <br />2)Cory Taylor IS stonesour and IS slipknot so this whole thing about integrating the two doesn't make any sense.  They are two different bands but are the same vocalist.  He just has a very talented voice and uses it well.<br />3)Many of you also say that it should have continued on its course of hard metal style but wouldnt that in itself become boring. Look at Hatebreed,dont get me wrong I enjoy them a lot but if you heard one song you heard them all.  So change also helps you stay with the CD always.<br />4)A band should always evolve in order to stay alive and to continue to deliver really great music.  Slipkont did just that and needless to say it has gone for the better and hopefully will continue.  <br />Much of you need to open your minds and truely listen to the new album to experience what I consider to be a masterpiece.  It just shows that a band that can move from hard screaming fast pace styles to a deep level of music, something that can carry you away, should be recognized as one of the greatest bands today!!  Again this CD is a masterpeice and is very deep, and has brought a whole new level to rock and metal that I think everyone should be exposed to!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I am a 36-year-old metal head, and I have never ever once in my enjoyed any &quot;nu metal&quot;, let alone anything by Slipknot.....until now. This is not a CD. It is a piece, a &quot;work.&quot; It's a complete masterpiece. You will see all the kids writing their reviews wondering &quot;what happend to Slipknot?&quot; Well, they grew up and have expanded their horizons, not to mention the fact that Rick Rubin(Slayer, Danzig) produced this CD. Slipknot have matured and are bringing metal back to what it should sound like. I saw them on Headbangers Ball a few weeks back, and they said this CD was their Led Zepplin 4. Jamie said that this was a bold statement. Let me tell you, Slipknot backs up that statement with this CD. It will thoroughly kick your a**!!!! Thank you Slipknot for releasing this masterpiece, and please keep up the good work!! True metal still rules!!!!
0156027321|5.0|Just finished this book and no need to comment on the story as Its been praised plenty in the other 900 reviews.  I do have one thing to say though.  You could easily get by reading just the 2nd part, and it in itself is a great story.  The first part give you a good history of things, and the last part, sheds some light on the second part.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I saw this movie on a whim because it was playing on my college campus and the ticket was two bucks. When it was over, I started thinking about what I could have done with that two hours instead of watch this crap.<br />Shockingly, I've encountered many people who thought that this movie was &quot;brilliant,&quot; and that if I didn't like it that I just &quot;didn't understand it.&quot; What's to understand? This movie has no plot, the humor is weak...it's basically as bad as a student art film.<br />I've since come to realize that this movie suffers from the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome (ENCS). In the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, a vain emperor employs two con artists to tailor a new set of clothes for him. According to the con men, the clothing is so fine that it can only be seen by those of high intelligence. So the con men start weaving nothing, and everyone who goes to examine the &quot;clothing&quot; pretends that they can see it simply because they don't want people to think that they are too dumb to see it. The emperor goes so far as to &quot;wearing&quot; the &quot;clothes&quot; (so basically he's naked) because he's afraid that people will think he is dumb if he admits that he cannot see the fibers.<br />This movie reminded me of that. It's a film with a meandering plot and terrible characters disguised as a &quot;brilliant, intellectual film.&quot; I think most of the people who thought it was brilliant are simply too pompous to admit that the movie was garbage. Instead, they like to think that they are intelligent enough to understand the &quot;hidden meanings.&quot; What hidden meanings? <br />A movie's principal purpose should be to entertain. Everything else comes second. So what if this film is considered to have hidden meanings and symbolism? It failed to entertain me, so in essence it failed as a film.
B00005Y1UX|3.0|of this movie not be angry about this film? Come on, Robert Redford asks Woody Harrelson to sell him his wife for a million bucks. HELLO? Can't Demi have an opinion on that? In the billiard room scene the two men talk about Demi as if she is some sexual pleasuring device. Plus, there is a microphone in the picture for about 3 minutes. <BR>Other then that, the film is entertaining, but that is only because Robert Redford is in it. Brilliant casting, who needs a million bucks reward to sleep with RR, especially when compared to Woody.<BR>Demi knows that, Robert knows that and the (female) viewer knows that. Poor Woody marvels what went wrong for a bit too long to come over as at least decent intelligent. <BR>Good thing is that we never see Demi and Robert \\"doing it\\".<BR>All in all the movie works in favour of RR, and that is not a bad thing.<BR>Yeah, I know my english is bad :)
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I started watching this with only a really vague idea in my mind; one of a pretentious, arsey look at modern day drug problems and stupidly over-the-top camera techniques.<BR>To a certain extent I was disappointed, but to a certain extent the film lived up to my expectations.<BR>Truely there were some incredible performances from a highly gifted cast (special mention must be made of Ellen Burstyn, who terrified me, sickened me and made me feel so sorry for her simultaniously.<BR>One the surface this is a no-nonsense, hard hitting film about what drugs can do to you; how they affect you and the people you love. All four characters start out bright and normal, but slowly sink into a world consumed by drugs (namely heroin).<BR>Yet what brought this film down for me was how it lost its way towards the end. The director started off brilliantly, with pieces of film that were hard-hitting and terrible, but that people could relate to. As the film progresses, we are sent whirling through a number of unnecessary camera tecnhiques and voice techniques, not to mention graphic scenes merely for effect (the cutting off of an arm etc). Yet the ending leaves us with a sense of sadness and regret, but paints a vivid picture in our minds; one of both warning and preaching. The degredatoin the characters suffer are all a means to an end for the point the direction wishes to make: please don't use heroin!<br />To conclude, there is no doubt in my mind that this was an interesting film to watch, with great underlying meaning, excellent acting and, at times, some highly skillful directing. However, I found it hard towards the end, to engage my interest, as it just went from strange to stranger.<BR>If I could give half stars, this would be 3 and a half, but I think in conclusion it has a well earned 3 stars. Worth seeing.
B0000C1733|2.0|This seems like a compilation that was put together by label ceo's.  I find it appauling that the earliest song on this album is higher ground.   Where the heck is &quot;Knock Me Down&quot;, or &quot;Fight Like a Brave.&quot;  These are great songs that I think should be heard by any chili peppers fan.  If you are a true fan of the peppers I suggest you NOT buy this cd if you are some random jerk off who wants to hear &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; a million times then buy it.  My own personal favortite RHCP song isn't even on this compilation.  Where's &quot;Aeroplane?&quot;  As for the two new songs they put on here I have to say download them off the internet, legally or illegally.  Don't pay full price for this compilation.  Even the cover art work looks like a lack of thought was put into it.  Don't get me wrong I love the chili peppers but this greatest hits album leave the late Hillel Slovak spinning in his grave because the obviously forgot about him on this thing.
B000000WA4|4.0|wow. this record is definately amoung the best work the pumpkins ever created. so many amazings songs, packed onto 2 amazing discs. alot of people would think this seems contrived or just self-indulgent, but the pumpkins prove that every song on here deserves the space it is given. i would go into a more in-depth review but that would go on forever since i am so in love with this album and the pumpkins in general. suffice it to say that without this essencial collection, you are missing out on a monumental part of rock in the 90's history.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Only four words can describe this: Worst Slipknot Album Ever. If you liked the self titled one and IOWA, this will be a HUGE disappointment. It's like they put no effort at all into this one. Also, you can hear corey's stone sour influence right from the beginning. Oh yeah, forgot to mention there are three acoustic songs in this cd...yep, you heard me right, acoustic songs on a slipknot album. Hard to believe, but true. I'm giving it 2 stars because it does have a few good songs(Duality, Welcome, Pulse Of The Maggots, Before I Forget) but 4 good songs out of 14 is a disaster. I am sure they will lose a bunch of fans as well as gain new ones...from my side, they just lost one.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I actually first heard Muse when a friend back in Australia bought Absolution, because they were playing the Big Day Out, and we wanted to hear some new bands who were there that we hadn't heard before.<br />At first I was interested after hearing 'stockholm syndrome', I thought to myself... whoah... here's a band who is actually different to all the generic crud going around on the radio. I also noted the similarity to Thom Yorke, another of my favorite singers, which in my opinion only boosted Muse's airplay in my head, it's not a bad thing to be compared to one of the last 2 decades most influential bands like Radiohead. Many have been compared, but few hold a candle like Muse do, and since buying 'Absolution' for myself, they have far surpassed any sense of inspiration that I have drawn collectively from Radioheads catalogue.<br />'Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes' has taken it's place in my heart as my favorite song ever, with well over 150 plays on my ipod. (The nearest song after that only has 71 plays!)<br />I honestly cannot reccomend this album highly enough!<br />Buy it! Buy it now! Spread the muse goodness to your friends! They will reward you with more fantastic music to come.
B00005A46T|5.0|Ok, I was given this cd along with their self titled album. Now, I have grown to appriciate the self titled but Iowa stands out above it. It is harder, faster, the vocals are incredable. Corey's screaming is great, it seems geniune, not screaming for the hell of it. It fits the mood, and gives this album something that the self titled failed to achieve. As for Vol. 3 The Sublminal Verses, it is NOT the same. The cd is more melodic than Iowa, more of the self titled album. However the lyrics are a little depressing, mostly about loss and things of that sort. Anyhow, if you are looking to buy Iowa or Vol. 3, take Iowa. While Vol. 3 takes time to get used to, it is a good album. Just isnt as good as Iowa. Any Slipknot fan MUST own this album.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|For all the hype there was to wrestlemania XX, there is no doubt about it that it had to take alot to actually live up to challenge. The show itself from begiinhg to end was very entertaining.  I have ceratainly seen better though.  After being a long time wrestling fan and seeing every wrestlemania, I would rank it as one of the top five, but there were clearly, atleast three or four better Wrestlemania's better than this.  Buying the DVD, was a great bargain for me.  Including the frony cover and overall packaging, the actual show, and all the extras there is not many better things you can for 25 to 30 bucks.  I have never seen a Wrestling DVD with more extras.  Overall it was very entertaining, for me to purchase the DVD.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Ever since coming out of the movie theatre after seeing The Matrix: Reloaded, my mind had been thinking over and over about the possible great endings to such a phenomenon. I was thinking perhaps that the Wachowski brothers had purposely left us very on edge for a mind-blowing conclusion to this sci-fi epic. Well, very sadly, I was wrong. Friends of mine and I had increasing anticipation for Revolutions, expecting so much from it, which only made the end result even more depressing.<br />After both The Matrix and Reloaded, you thought that the brothers could not go wrong, they were able to create the story in 1999, sustain its mystique and action in May 2003, but have no idea how to end such a complex saga. Everything was perfect, even down to the soundtracks - you knew that they couldn't go wrong at this point. And it's such a shame that it all ended the way it did, I sat in my seat of the theatre just thinking &quot;that cannot be the end?!?! It can't be!&quot;, expecting there to be another scene of dialogue to explain absolutely everything, to give all the answers... but it never came. Instead, you got a very cliched ending, which would annoy every one of the hardcore Matrix fans out there - the philosophy had vanished, the amazing kung-fu sequences, and coolness of the all black look and sunglasses - all for a cold Zion and a dull feeling while watching the film. I regret for what I will write, I hate criticising this film because of the greatness of the first two but certain things have to be said. I had no idea that such an ending was coming.<br />Continuing exactly where Reloaded left off, you find both Neo and Agent Smith (in human form as Bane) in a coma, and the humans preparing for battle against the machines who are drilling their way through to Zion. Then you find Neo in a world between worlds - between the real world and the matrix, with you having no idea how he got there. The story then speaks for itself. With some poor pieces of dialogue, used ideas and too many special effects - Revolutions was nothing special compared to its predecessors. <br />The Matrix - all about those beautifully choreographed fight scenes, interesting philosophical conversation and the cool all black costumes: this was not to be in the third instalment. There are two, very brief hand-to-hand combat scenes (including the final showdown with Neo Vs Smith) and an overlong CGI sentinel battle, which was not what Matrix action sequences were about. Yes, have some gunfire and explosions, but you know it was really all about how much arse could be kicked by Neo, Morpheus and Trinity. Impressive yes, but Revolutions did not really look, or even feel, like a Matrix movie. It didn't have any would-be favourite lines, memorable, yet inspirational lines by Morpheus, like the previous two films had. To put it simply, it just wasn't as enjoyable nor as gripping as the first or as action packed as the second. And the ending fight scene, the one we all had really been looking forward to, was a huge let down, especially coming from the Wachowski brothers - you get tired of too much flying and not enough actual fighting between the two men, it gets very confusing indeed. And Neo being &quot;The One&quot; certainly doesn't act it because he is made to look weak against Smith in the end. You were maybe thinking, &quot;Ok, this is what we have all been waiting for at last&quot; but, to put it simply, no. <br />Character development was another big factor in this film - there was none! The Merovigian, the comical French program, had only enough screen time to eat just three olives. You would have thought that this guy had a lot to do with the Matrix, as Reloaded had made him out to be an important, dangerous person, but his character is cut short in a very blunt way, you don't even find out who he is or what he does. And for his wife? In short - she has one line. Plus, too many new characters were introduced here, and took up way too much screen time and were insignificant to the story. Keanu Reeves was off screen for the majority of the film... and he's &quot;The One&quot;, the main character. And Morpheus? The producers had not only put a knife in Laurence Fisburne's back, but a bullet as well, as he had no real part in this film. His scenes were too short and he did not have enough lines to say.<br />I suppose visual effects really saved this film, as the plot spiralled out of control, becoming way too complex, even for the Wachowski's to comprehend - they either lost interest, ran out of special effects, or most likely ran out of ideas. They spent three months just designing the rain drops in the battle between Neo and Smith! That three months could have been spent on the ending at least, let alone the whole film itself. Which makes you wonder - why release both films in such a rush? It seems in the four years the spent making the two, all efforts were concentrated on trying to make Reloaded the great follow up success that it is, then only leaving just enough time to fit in two fight scenes and a sentinel attack for the third instalment. To be honest, I would have rather waited an extra year, perhaps even more, for a really good ending rather then a quickly put together climax, because I had favoured the strategy of leaving so many unanswered questions, a mystery - then for them to explain it all, end it completely in Revolutions. It never happened.<br />But now, as I and many others have witnessed, there will be an eternal disappointment and resentfulness to Revolutions and how great it could have been, I hope the Wachowski's realise this as much as we do.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Okay, first off, don't listen to people who say, &quot;This isn't as heavy as the other two,&quot; or &quot;This isn't as good as the other two.&quot; This is the album that the self-titled and IOWA wishes it could be. Before I picked this up, the only Slipknot song that I liked was Wait and Bleed. Other than that, I thought all of the other songs were complete crap. Most of the older songs are just Corey screaming and swearing, and it just sounded like Linkin Park on a testosterone trip. This album is different<br />This time, it seems like some thought was put into the songs. There is sill Corey yelling, there is still great drumming, there are still heavy guitar riffs (this time with a few solos - something I've been waiting for Slipknot to do for a while), and it sill sounds angry. But this time, there are even some things that sound like ballads - or as close as Slipknot can come to one. That really shows how they have grown. And, to the dismay of some of the gramatically challenged, there is no more swearing. That's right, folks, no PA on this baby. That was one of the things that turned me off about the old Slipknot, and I hope they continue this.<br />In closing, while this is not quite as good as the nu-metal masterpiece L.D. 50 (come on, you know these guys are nu-metal), it does get Slipknot one step closer to achieving their and my dream of them being an actual metal band. Now go out and buy this CD.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I first saw the video for &quot;Show me how to live&quot; on MTV about a year ago.I thought the song was excellent but hesitated about getting the cd, eventhough I love RATM. I concidered this album a poor mtv record with only one hit single and didnt want to get swindled in buying it. So, i didn't, I downloaded it. And I must say I'm not sorry. Definetly not sorry. I really think its an excellently played, sung and produced record which has enough trippy, psychedelic guitar sounds by Tom Morello and copyrigted screams by the exSoundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. And they are well put together. I am satisfied.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Sarah McLachlan has stood out the test of time.  With mutliplatinum albums, Grammys, Junos, the woman continues to be mainstream.<br />To me, mainstream is a mediocre thing for Sarah.  I find this album to be very mainstream.<br />Her latest offering does not give me the chills or the tingle that her previous albums have, i.e. Mirrorball, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, etc.<br />Yes, there are a few songs on this album, &quot;Train Wreck&quot;, &quot;World's on Fire&quot; and &quot;Stupid&quot; that makes me rate this album 3 stars.<br />However, I think she could have done much better.  Her songwriting has diminished significantly compared to previous years.  <br />The melodies are fair.  It's like I've already heard these before.  <br />So, I'd buy this album with reservation -- don't listen to the hype of this album because I don't see it.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|If this movie had been a meal I would have sent it back for being overcooked; either that, or just tossed it in the garbage.  SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE gave me anything but an enjoyable story; instead, this &quot;romantic comedy&quot; about a sixtysomething play boy finding love for the first time with an attractive, &quot;mature&quot; woman just floated along like an unmanned rowboat in the middle of a lake.  And it floated on and on and on and on. . .<br />There's nothing redeeming about Jack Nicholson's character, and the actor plays the role in his usual creepy and disgusting manner.  Meanwhile, Diane Keaton plays Nicholson's flighty and hysterical love interest--albeit a very attractive one.  And for Keanu Reeves to be the odd man out of this love triangle requires a suspension of disbelief in proportion to the Grand Canyon.  (Which is exactly where the script should have been thrown.)<br />'Nuff said.  SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE gets two stars for Keaton being so easy on the eye, and an inspiration for all of us middle agers.  Now if I could just get the dog to eat this, but he doesn't want any part of it, either.<br />--D. Mikels
B0001XAPX8|2.0|I was really anxious to see this movie. I have aleays loved Hopkins and Kidman and Harris is a great supporting actor for every film.<br />But this film is really disappointing. Not only for the actors, but for the story which is too confusing and plenty of flashes-back. The accident in the first scene is also a failure, because the film loses all interest. Sinise's part is really strange: he appears in the beginning till Hopkins refuses to continue writing his book; in the middle of the film (I had forgotten of him) he appears in a dinner with Hopkins and Kidman and, then, forgotten. At the very end of the film, Sinise's character is again in the screen and now he plays the main role.<br />Hopkins' play is really decent (I was fed up of dangerous-minds characters), but I think he is over-exploited. Kidman's is really not her best acting: extremely bitter and unexpressive.<br />To sum up, a really boring film and, sometimes, uncomprehensible.
B00020HEG6|5.0|The only thing tacky about this review is the title that I have given it! Apart from that, Williams' new score is sheer brilliance. He has taken a drastic step, a gamble if you will, with this soundtrack, but as usual he has pulled it off. When I first heard that Williams was using Medieval Motiffs for the most part of his score, I tried to imagine them, but they compared to nothing with the real McCoy. His theme for Buckbeak is a towering achievement, a soaring, excellent piece of music. His theme in the track &quot;A window to the past&quot; is wonderfully sad. A truly note worthy track has got to be Aunt Marge's Waltz, it starts off slow and quiet, and typical Williams, builds to an out-of-control, frenzied conclusion. His use of Shakespeare for the song, &quot;Something Wicked this way comes&quot; is also remarkable. I would recommend this cd to any lover of music. Brilliant. The Maestro is back!
B0001AVZA8|4.0|It's funny to see some actors don't feel the passing of time. Besides, even if they hadn't worked before, they seem to have a great complicity even in their 60's. Excuse for talking about age of people.<br />They make laugh and they show tenderness, too. Of course Diane Keaton has a really suitable role but Nicholson is still a bad-tempered, irresistible, old man as in many of his late films.<br />Nevertheless, the story is really fine and amusable. It's not another romantic comedy but a soap box opera!<br />The only thing is: was it necessary to show both actors almost nude? It's a marvellous scene, but sure they asked for a great amount of money for doing that.
B000002IP1|5.0|I still like this Phil Collins album too.  He makes such hummable songs!  I can't tell you how many times I've hummed to &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot; when it came on in 1989.  I still do today. He's so good at these rhythms and melodies.  The other songs like &quot;Do You Remember&quot; also help define '80s music so very well.  I like the horn section on &quot;Something Happened..&quot;  Deborah Cox did a dance remake of it a few years ago, so this song has a second life all over again.  Phil's social themes throughout the album are well stated without being too preachy or pushy.  This is a very deep album. I still like his '85 album the most, but this album comes a close second!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot's other albums were hardcore to say the least. I thought they were pretty good, but this new piece of work tops it. Subliminal Verses show Slipknot with a new type of voice. Slipknot is not afraid to slow it down. I respect that.<br />The songs that really stick out ARE:<br />Duality <BR>Circle<BR>Pusle of the Maggots<BR>Vermillion<BR>Vermillion Pt.2<BR>The Virus of Life<BR>The Nameless<BR>Danger - Keep Away
B000083E79|5.0|This is a very great album!  I noticed a lot of record labels that she was on.  Seemed like they didn't know how to market or promote those albums during her short stints with them.  But her singing stood out on all of them and she kept moving forward in her career in music, TV and movies.  I like the earlier hits on here, even though it was 1977 that I first heard her songs. Except for I Got You Babe, some of the '60s songs are those I got to hear for the first time on this collection.  But the later decades of the '80s, '90s and recently I recognized, especially If I Could Turn Back Time, Believe, Take Me Home, Song For the Lonely and others.  There seems to be an emphasis toward her two most recent albums with the songs, but they were smart to cover every phase of her career.  This is a fabulous career retrospective on her music and Cher is a true diva in every sense of the word!!!!!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I got to tell you, I realy apreciate when a band looks at another direction in their career. In this case Slipknot has done a good job with experimenting with new sounds. there are some slow songs on this album, but they're still pretty good. The lyrics are amazing. Good job again. I strongly recomend it...
B00005Q66T|5.0|I liked this second greatest hits album from Madonna!  I even sent it as Christmas presents to my friends too!  It starts off with her dance numbers, then shifts into her more mature territory before returning back to the party in the end with Music!  It seems to focus more on Ray of Light and Music more than the two albums before it.  But I tend to listen to Deeper and Deeper and Erotica just as much as Ray of Light, Beautiful Stranger, Power of Goodbye, Don't Tell Me and Music.  The placing of the songs could have been better, but this is Madonna and she does what she wants on here!  Excellent effort overall!!!!
B000067J1H|5.0|This movie has become my favorite. I first saw it on pay-per-view a few years ago, and found it so interesting that I watched it three times that day. I've never done that before, and haven't since.<br />I like the fact that the movie has so many layers. Its &quot;in your face&quot; but its also subtle.  I'm watching it again and after about the 8th time, I still see details and nuances that I've missed before - but not because I haven't noticed them in a &quot;oh gee, look at that&quot; kind of way. I missed them because they were intentionally MADE hard to see. Difficult to understand? Not really, more in the way of &quot;I've never seen that in a movie before so it can't be happening now&quot; kind of way. Except in this movie, it IS being shown that way. <br />Lots and lots of scenes,  situations, and dialog are just plain unexpected. Off the wall, yes. But also (I hate to use this word because it sounds so &quot;film-class 101&quot;) profound. Yes, this movie has profound moments.<br />If you've become addicted to this movie like I have, you have your own favorite moments in the movie, and these define you and your character at times.<br />I like the way contrasting views on so many topics are expressed by the &quot;dual starring personalities&quot;. The twist of just who these people Really are, well that remains there in the background, tweaking your brain cells. Tweaking MY brain cells, anyway.<br />If another movie supplants this one as my favorite, I'll return to this forum and alter my story, but otherwise, I'm sticking to it.
B00000F1D3|4.0|This is a good album by Cher!  I think that she got tired of singing midtempo rock songs and wanted to get back to dancing again.  I like the electronica direction she takes on this album.  It's made Brian Rawling and Mark Taylor far more received now with their rumbling dance songs on her album and others. Runaway, Believe, All or Nothing and the other offerings are quite different. The least favorite song I don't care too much is &quot;Taking Back My Heart.&quot;  It kind of drags a bit and doesn't fit well into the album.  I like Taxi Taxi as well.  Another song that stands out is her dance version of her '87 song &quot;We All Sleep Alone.&quot;  It takes a more disco direction this time as opposed to the Bon Jovi-based power ballad sound of before, and it has me dancing to it every time! I have listened to her later album &quot;Living Proof&quot; more, but &quot;Believe&quot; is such a fabulous effort from her--she sounds more confident on this one than past efforts.

1594200106|5.0|There are very few books that will take you back through your own years as this one does.  Thomas Williams' &quot;The Moon Pinnace&quot; does this magic, but none I think have done it as poetically as Carlos Ruiz Zafon has done in this beautiful novel.  This book is one that will slow your reading as you near its end, not wanting to say farewell to what come to seem like old friends, and hoping that its author will write again very soon.
B00020HEG6|4.0|I have never been a big fan of John Williams, and I cannot say that I have heard a large number of his scores; and I have probably hated more of them than liked. That said, I think that this is one of the more interesting ones that I have heard, and while it may not be his best, it has enough in it for me to listen more closely. <br />Of course, the first track states &quot;Hedwig's Theme,&quot; with which Potter fans are now so familiar. From that, however, he departs from the previous two Potter films in terms of style, orchestration and themes. I love his use of medieval instruments: recorder, harpsichord, and an ensemble of some sort of double reed instrument (maybe shawm?). The choral setting of the text from Macbeth (&quot;Double Trouble&quot;) shows off a different harmonic approach than he usually takes: its words and music are slightly grotesque, which is in keeping with the story as a whole. In &quot;Hagrid the Professor,&quot; Williams shows a textbook knowledge of writing in traditional Renaissance style, complete with the aforementioned double reed ensemble and quirky counterpoint. He even enters a jazz-like idiom in the wildly rhythmic and dissonant \\"Knight Bus\\" (my personal favorite track). There is still some characteristic Williams remaining, however. The opening of the comic &quot;Aunt Marge's Waltz&quot; uses a jaunty oboe solo and strings in a light, dancelike fashion, ascending notes and changing key. The piece goes on till it reaches a raucous coda and finishes in a grand amusing cadence that is sure to bring a chuckle to the listener. And let's not forget the virtuosic flute solo in &quot;Secrets of the Castle,&quot; which is much fun to listen to. <br />Unfortunately, Williams occasionally lets himself bombast the listener with his trademark thick orchestration and loud horns. Fortunately for us (or, at least, me), this rarely happens. This soundtrack is very different from the previous two Harry Potter soundtracks. Williams has taken a few steps back from his normal bombastic assaults and entered a realm more experimental and somewhat introspective (like the haunting recorder solo in \\"A Window to the Past\\"); and, unlike the previous Potter scores, this one seems to have its own special character, which makes is what makes it so appealing. It is moodier, jauntier, stranger, and so much more interesting than most of his other scores I can think of. I can only hope that that will be reflected in the film opening next week as well. To fans of John Williams, I can say that this disc will probably not disappoint.
B00005JKC3|1.0|It's ironic that the star of this &quot;movie&quot; is a strong, enormous, solid, smart superhero. The film itself is the complete opposite. It is weak, tiresome, stretched-out, and hopelessly inane.<br />I rarely give one-star reviews, because I truly understand that it is hard to make a good movie these days, and it takes great effort from all involved. I even gave two stars to SHOWGIRLS because it at least tried to be entertaining despite of its ineptitude. But I haven't an ounce of sympathy for this turgid waste of time.<br />The problem with the story is that there really is no story. Right from the get-go, each scene of this 140-minute monstrosity is like a cesspool, stinking to high heavens with monotone dialogue that no real human-being would ever speak in. Every single scene seems like part of an extended trailer for a bigger, better movie.<br />The first hour or so of the film is slow-moving. This would be fine if this time were used for exposition or character development. After all, who wants to see an action movie where you don't care about any of the stars? Well, in this first hour, we basically watch actors read lines. Bad lines. What's more, there is gratuitous use of split-screens and other comic book conventions throughout. This can be a cool effect to set the tone for a film (e.g. CREEPSHOW, NARC), but here it just comes off annoying.<br />We're introduced to Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) and his &quot;love interest&quot; Betty (Jennifer Connely), using the term loosely because there is no chemistry between them at all. Don't blame the actors, because with a screenplay this moronic, I don't think any actor, living or dead, at the top of their game, could have given a believable performance. Sam Elliot, usually an excellent character actor, is just a cardboard cutout in a military outfit in HULK. Meanwhile, Nick Nolte is left with some lines he can scream in anger. Whoa, their Nick! Save some of that for your agent for putting you in this flop!<br />But once the &quot;action&quot; scenes roll along, they make you wish these idiots would start talking again. All the unconvincing CGI effects that fill the screen begin to mold together after a while, and you can't tell what's going on anymore. When an action scene seems like it's going to be nifty, such as the much bally-hooed &quot;tank-throwing&quot; sequence, it ends up going on for waaay too long until you're just praying one of those dumb smart missiles will hit the green beast and put us out of our misery.<br />However, in this abyss of retarded pretentiousness, nothing can possibly outstink the utter foulness of the climax. After 140 minutes of corny dialogue and Z-grade special effects, we come to find out there is NO ENDING! Did that guy die? Why did that lake freeze? What are we looking at? Is that a giant hand coming out of the sky? In the end, it just doesn't really matter.<br />Trust me. Save your money. If you really must see it, steal it. Don't pay money to rent it. Seeing this movie for free is still a rip-off. This is 140 minutes of your life you can never get back.<br />-Sean Lynch<br />5-29-04
B00003CXCW|5.0|In response to the reviewer who is complaining that this movie is &quot;...only a fullscreen version&quot; I would challenge them to find anything pre 1954-55 that was actually filmed in widescreen. I am of the firm opinion that the ratio that this movie has been transferred in is indeed the one in which it was filmed. Maybe it is just that it is such a brilliant piece of film making that comes across so far ahead of it's time that leads anyone to expect a &quot;widescreen&quot; version.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|In early June of 1999 I was lucky enough, through a pre-release demo, to be one of the first in the Portland area to hear this band's debut album.  Without going into detail, I'd had a long history of being able to tell what was going to be big and what would flop and right way, I knew these guys were going to be huge.  There was something so pure and raw about it that it still haunts me to this day.  Now to be fair, the World was on the verge of facing the over-hyped, over-sensationalized Y2K and Slipknot seemed to feed the emotional fire of a possible global chaos, yet there truly was something horrifically beautiful here all on its own.  It wasn't the bottom of the barrel to rock's long and sometimes capricious history but more, the cherry on top. <br />I'd never seen or heard anything like these guys before and the first (of six) times I saw them live, I truly would not have been surprised if they'd doused us in gasoline and set us all on fire.  It was wonderful!  I still get a bit choked up when I think of how accurately they preformed `Scissors' (my favorite Knot song).<br />This band's apparent problem was they simply got too big, too fast.  `Iowa' was all too evident of this and I'm not even going to go there other than to say it sounded like they had already run out of solid ideas and felt a need to fall back on the old notion, \\"Look, people!  Aren't we EEEEvil!  We worship SAAAtan!\\" <br />In the beginning, they were writing and performing for themselves and didn't give a s**t and that's where true brilliance lies.  As soon as they found themselves in the pocket of record company bureaucracy, as `lastnail' pointed out, the pressure of everyone's expectations ensued heavily and as I see it, they chocked.  \\"Let's change our masks! Let's do solo gigs! Let's spend all our new money on a stupid and obnoxious lightshow and not stop to think about how ridiculous it looks! Let's change for change sake and Hey, guys, let's take a BREAK!\\"<br />I was flipping througha metal magazine a few days ago (Corey was on the cover and it caught my eye) and there was a blurb from one of them saying that if they hadn't taken a break they didn't know where Slipknot would be.  A break?  Hell, KISS put out eight albums in their first four years and toured constantly.   I guess, however, we should be thankful that a longer break wasn't taken.  There might've been more ballads on this latest effort and there's nothing that gets my goat more than a metal band who thinks they might appeal to a bigger audience by including this form of drivel.  The three ballads on this album that SHOULD'VE been called `The Subliminal PURSES' left me feeling like I could have saved some money and just gotten out my sister's old `Air Supply' records.<br />In all fairness though, there were a few moments in the first and even second listenings where I found myself smiling at some fresh ideas.  I do like `The Blister Exists' and `Pulse of the Maggots' has it's moments but the only trace of what Slipknot was is in `The Virus of Life' but even the little choking thing at the end sounded contrived like a desperate attempt to recapture the purity of `Scissors's 120%, off-the-cuff, hair raising finale.  The rest of it just sounds as if they're not hungry anymore due to steady diet of maybe, RITALIN!  <br />If any other band had put this album out, I might not think it half bad, but its SLIPKNOT for cryin' out loud so I have say it's a PHANTOM, A MYSTERY AND IT LEAVES ME NOTHING!!!<br />If ballads and breaks are what this band has become all about maybe they SHOULD just sit back in their easy chairs with their slippers and their paper and retire with a nice stiff martini.  This is truly sad to me.
0156027321|3.0|This book was enjoyable enough, but toward the end of Pi's adventures at sea, I lost my ability to suspend my disbelief. The story simply became too fantastical. It seemed the ending was rushed, and the twist at the end didn't do a thing for me. Overall, though, it was a decent enough novel - a good, light read.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|This movie is awesome! I am definately going to see the sequel in theaters. Kate Beckinsale was great. So was Scott Speedman. This is like another Van Helsing movie. Only with not that extended in action content. The only flaw in my opinion is that the werewolves weren't that real looking.
B00006RAKP|5.0|For 35 years, Elton Jon has been entertaining the world with his music. And for the first time ever, all of his greatest hits have been compiled for this 34 - song collection, which contains 2 discs featuring 34 of his 45 top 40 singles, plus a bonus disc.<br />Disc 1 contains all the big hits, starting with the classic 1970 top 10 hit \\"Your Song\\". Following are \\"Levon\\" and \\"Tiny Dancer\\", two songs that weren't released as singles but became standards for Elton over the years. Next comes the classic \\"Rocket Man(I Think It's Going To Be A Long, Long Time)\\". This single started a string of 16 consecuitve top 20 singles, all of which are included here. Had \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" gone into the top 10, he ould have had a run of 17 consecutive top 10 singles. Still, he had a longer run of hits than any other 1970s' entertainer, including \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" (number 2), \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" (number 2), \\"The Bitch Is Back (number 4) and \\"Bennie And The Jets\\" (number 1). In 1975 alone, 3 of his singles went to nunber one.<br />Disc 2 begins with the number one hit \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\", a duet with Kiki Dee that ruled the charts for 4 weeks in September 1976. After that, Elton hit some hungry years but bounced back in 1980 with 'Little Jeannie\\", which soared to number 3. Throughout the 1980s', he consistently hit the top 10 with \\"I Guees That's Why They Call It The Blues\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That\\", \\"Nikita\\" and \\"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\\". His hit streak extended into the 1990s' with \\"The One\\", \\"Can You Feel The ove Tonight\\", \\"Circel Of Life\\" and \\"Something About The Way You Look Tonight\\". In 2000, he scored two more hits with 'I Want Love\\" and \\"This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore' (the hit single \\"Original Sin\\" came out too late for inclsuion).<br />The bonus disc is okay but not much to rave about. Almost evr big hit is here, with the exception of \\"Candle In The Wind 1997\\" (which was left off for obvious personal reasons). This is a great collection of solid 20th century music by a living legend -Elton John.
B0001HAISG|2.0|Yeah, I didn't see this movie. And, I don't know anyone that saw this movie. I don't know anyone that has any sort of opinion on this movie one way or the other. It got completely unnoticed. There isn't anyone the slightest bit famous in it. So I wouldn't waste my time with it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|As time has proven, you don't have to be stoned out of your mind to see the genius in Pink Floyd's 1973 album \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" (though it can't hurt). This album has been discovered by all generations young and old. <br />This masterpiece begins with \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\". The first half is an eerie instrumental that begins with 14 seconds of dead silence. The second half is a long, slow blues with a somber vocal. \\"On The Run\\" is an excellent instrumental with exquisite guitar work. \\"Time\\" follows, a lament to how short life is. \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" is a haunting instrumental, its only voices being the talking in the beginning and the wailing that goes on throughout the entire song. \\"Money\\" is a great rocker that also became the band's first top 20 hit. I like the storyline on how money corrupts people. It immediately segues into \\"Us And Them\\". This song was originally written for a movie. It is eerie but at the same time peaceful an relaxing. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is another great instrumental. \\"Brain Damage\\" is a song about Syd Barrett, the group's founding member who suffered a nervous breakdown. \\"Eclipse\\" closes the album, and ends itth same way it begins: with a long, pulsating heartbeat.<br />I highly recommend this album. And listen to it while watching \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" with the sound off on the television. And one more thing: ignore that stupid Infidel and his praise for those poseurs Duran Duran, who have not one ounce of aptitude in them.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Like Avril's 1st album, Let Go, all of the tracks are enjoyable, not just the first single.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd was undoubtedly one of the most influencial bands of the 70's, with many albums out during this period of time.  But all together, this is definetly their best ever.  This album has influenced so many bands that are out right now and have already come out with selling like 13 million copies you know it has to be good.  THere are so many classic tracks, I dont know where to begin, Breathe is like the best song ever, Time: what hasnt been said about it, Money: classic no more to say, Brain damage: THe lunatic is on the grass makes the album for me. THis is the definitive album of all time. Rock on.
B00005176F|5.0|Most people when they think of Blur will think of the brilliant Song 2 (woo-hoo), but they are so much more. In Britian, they are huge, and if any one wanted to do on project on Brit Pop, then Blur is it. Their spectrum of music is amazing, from the rock of Song 2, the uplifiting gospel trach that is tender, the 1990s dance track of Girls and Boys to the totally out there Park Life. Bands like Blur come around on a very rare occasion, so just eat the up whilst you can. An example of why British Music is so far ahead of thw rest of the world.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|when gilmore girls first ame out i was like i am gonna luv this show. n i as rigth. the first season was so exciting and now i have it at home to watch 4eva.<BR>i cant wiat 4 season too to come out<br />if u r buying this dvd season for a teenaged girl who luvs to have ufn ur makin the right choice
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's image: &quot;just like me for who I am, cuz that's all ur gonna get&quot;. And her songs are SO her. She's probably one of my favorite singers because she is just so herself, and Some of her songs-- they just ROCK! I especially like &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; because she really writes them in such a way it's capturing and it relates. I also liked &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; since it's so her and so what I wanted to be. The only thing I'm a bit disapointed in was that when her onstage performance vocal was so different than the nice crystal-y voice on the CD and it wasn't that 'good'. It's either they changed the voice too much or that Lavigne needs to work more there; (I think) but genrally still liked the album alot. Being anything but ordinary, and (I was surprised she still didn't change her image into those tarty Spears) that's what I really like about this CD.
B00004Z459|1.0|Are you stupid?  If the answer is yes, then this is the cd for you, my friend.  Bang your head and twirl your hair, you mindless twits.
B00006CXSS|2.0|Okay, the acting was great, effects were great, realism was pretty good, authenticity not bad as well.  It was a great way to waste a day or two.<br />I'm not an Ambrose fan, which detracts from the series a little bit.  I'm just not into his ultra-glorification of war, and felt that though they did a good job showing the horrors of combat, the crappiness of downtime (with the exception of the cold in the Battle of the Bulge episodes) were really neglected.  These guys were constantly hungry, sleep deprived, on edge, etc...if you took the miniseries at its word, they jumped from battle to battle, with nary a break, in combat 6 or 7 days a week.<br />My biggest beef was on the special features.  There were a few, but for the size of this boxed set, I expected something more.  One documentary, a video diary, and a making of.  Not very much.  Like I said, I'm not an Ambrose fan, but with his input into the series I was really hoping for some historical extra stuff, maybe some mini documentaries about what else was going on in the war during X part of X episode, to put everything into perspective.<br />The worst, though, was &quot;The Message From Jeep&quot;.  It shows men and vehicles coming onto and up the beach at Normandy, with some spoken nonsense.  The men fade away, as do the vehicles, to show a bare beach.  Then, three modern Jeep vehicles appear on the beach.<br />This is, without a doubt, the worst case of crass comercialization and capitalism I've EVER seen in my life.  Trying to use the miniseries, and the blood spilled at Normandy, to sell Jeeps????!!?!  How dare they???  I was going to give this four stars, but after that...it left such a bad taste in my mouth I don't ever want to own the set (which I was planning on buying after watching a borrowed copy from my brother-in-law).  Furthermore, I never, ever want to purchase a vehicle from Jeep, used or new.  I had planned, at some point in my life, to purchase a Jeep Wrangler.  There's no chance of that happening now.at happening now.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I'm waiting for Ms. Spears' inevitable crash.  Watch for it, folks.  I would not recommend this cd to the target audience, but Britney would love to drag as many little girls down into the sewer as she can.  Pretty sad.
B0001GL3K4|2.0|This is one of those movies that you really want to like, because it's always on the cusp of being funny...but then isn't.  Also, the nasty little U.S. bashing politics should've been left out.  I found it offensive.  Liam Neeson is wonderful, as always, but the movie is definitely a &quot;rental&quot; only.
B000069CWE|1.0|Yes you are a retard if you like this.  Not recommended.
B0000633T6|1.0|A stupid movie! Only a Joke! Never buy it!
B00008H2LB|1.0|This music is for people with the mentality of Forrest Gump.  Or how about Crazy Cooter from The Dukes of Hazzard?  Perhaps Otis from The Andy Griffith Show.  You get the picture, now don't get the cd.
B000002IRL|5.0|This is my first Overkill experience (I'm a thrash metal newbie), and I'm on my way to try out this &quot;Years of Decay&quot; everyone's talking about.  Anyway, there is exactly one thing I don't like about this album:  the title.  Apart from that, this is FLAWLESS, HEAVY, THRASHING METAL.  &quot;Thanx for Nothin'&quot; is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life.  Every other song shines through, including their take on Edgar Winter's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Soulitude&quot; where they slow it down a little to let the Metallica and Iron Maiden influences show up more clearly.
B00006879E|1.0|This sounds about as much like Stevie Wonder as Red Hot Chili Peppers or Lenny Kravitz, you can't liken them to the great Stevie!  Save your money and buy the single if you like it, this is a dull cd, folks.
B000007T1M|5.0|In the general realm of rock music, I think System of a Down's 1998 eponymous debut would stand in the realm of 4-4.5 stars.  However, in the realm of nu-metal, where they are often unfortunately placed, this release is not only light years ahead of any other debut (with the possible exception of Rage Against the Machine - also sometimes lumped in with their neandertal nu-metal peers), but way ahead of anything else released at the time.  With swarms of mediocre bands polluting the airwaves in the late 1990's, it was refreshing to see a new and interesting take on a genre that was old hat almost immediately out of the gates.  Shunning the aimless anger of Korn and Limp Bizkit, System of a Down focused their lyrics and, more importantly, singer Serj Tankian's unique vocals toward more lofty goals:  the education of the American population to the wrongs not just in America and whoever RATM was interested in that week, but to the sufferings of their own people, the Armenians.<br />That's not to say that the album has a heavy-handed political agenda, though.  Yes, the lyrics are politically motivated, but in the era of fluff like Limp Bizkit's &quot;Rollin',&quot; it's more than welcome.  The opening riffs of &quot;Suite-Pee&quot; hit hard and the band rarely lets up, except for the introspective hit single &quot;Spiders.&quot;<br />For profane, unrelentingly angry nu-metal, you could turn anywhere and find what you're looking for.  But if you want to channel that anger and energy for something better than personal vengeance, System of a Down is the band for you.
B00005KHJR|5.0|This movie works on so many levels that it more than makes up for being somewhat dated. Don't be put off by the VERY low-budget production values and you'll be able to appreciate one of the few truly original movies of the last hundred years. From the very beginning when the producers thank Lord Summerisle for his cooperation, you are in for something out of the ordinary.<br />Detective Howie (Edward Woodward) plays an uptight, overly religious, churchgoing Scottish police officer who makes Ken Starr look like Hugh Hefner. He get a letter from Summerisle claiming that a twelve-year-old girl is missing. <br />Howie flies to the island in a flying boat to investigate and finds that the locals have something to hide. Not only are they not helping him, not only are they having great fun by jerking his chain, they add further insult to injury by practicing VERY old-style pagan religion. This includes copulating in graveyards, bawdy songs, initiations involving nude girls jumping over flames, or boys dancing around a phallic Maypole. When Howie challenges Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in his best performance) about having naked girls jumping over bonfires, Summerisle retorts \\"Of course they're naked! It's too dangerous to jump over the flame with their clothes on.\\" Howie is so exasperated by what he sees (including a woman nursing a baby in one hand and holding an egg with the other on a pew in a ruined church), he smashes an empty crate to make a crucifix out of the scraps of wood in an effort to have some semblance of order.<br />Howie learns that these pagans aren't just in it for the sex, though. He finds out that the previous year's crops failed and that ancient Celts used to appease their gods by sacrificing virgins to them! Now his search for the missing girl takes on greater urgency...<br />The character of Detective Howie isn't terribly sympathetic. He is rude, pushy, self-righteous and closed-minded. A fierce bible-believing cop was a bit outdated thirty years ago when this movie came out. He's even more so today. The fact that he's not a sympathetic figure ends up making the viewer feel guilty for not liking him, just as the annoying fat kid does in Lord of the Flies. <br />Lord Summerisle and his followers at first seem like hippies who make up for their lack of drugs and rock & roll with extra servings of sex. But there's more than fornication going on among the islanders.<br />The rest of the cast is great, including blonde Britt Ekland's body double for the waist-down shots -even though the double has much longer, brown hair. Another reviewer was right that the guy who picked Ekland's stripper stand-in likes the Jennifer Lopez look!<br />The innkeeper, the old codgers, the burly fisherman, the missing girl's kid sister, the schoolteacher and county clerk are so perfectly cast, that combined with the low budget and the thanks given to Summerisle for his help in making the film, it almost seems like a documentary.<br />The ending is truly shocking and will stay with you forever, not just because it's quite possible, even plausible, but because this sort of thing has happened for thousands of years and entire nations have considered it holy. <br />For a low-budget thriller, this movie will disturb you and make you think about life, death, religion and human nature like few other movies before or since. How many other movies can do that -even the big-budget ones?
B00005ASHM|5.0|There are numerous all-time BEST EVER ALBUM lists, and Pet Sounds routinely is at the very top.  This album could in time  become as a consensus list...the greatest for two reasons: 1.)  The amazing variety of moods...instruments and voices/harmonies of each song...invoking powerful images one can relate to; 2.)  Each song's arrangement is articulately done...again a tribute to Brain Wilson as the primary producer and arranger.  <br />I find in this album each song is top-notch...overall compliment each other...the result comes as close as any song group to perfection.  Each song's lyrics and music are brilliantly written and done.  Because of this...I gravitate to every song as a favorite depending on my stage in life and/or perspective I'm in.  Amazingly...this album quite possibly could have been even better...if the # 1 hit...GOOD VIBRATIONS and southern belle instrumental TROMBONE DIXIE were included as they were recorded at this time...the range of music would have further distanced it from the field.  The beautiful and sophisticated GOOD VIBRATIONS is often listed as one of the top ten All-time Rock and Roll Songs and justifiably so...but TROBONE DIXIE I find as good as the instrumental title song PET SOUNDS while invoking a feeling of small town...southern dixie charm on a Sunday afternoon.   <br />The songs in this album depict the many aspects of life we  experience...and the related emotions/memories we go through.  Brian was quoted as saying it was his tribute to LOVE!  For me, it comes as close as any album to capturing the chapters of love...and our struggles with learning and applying it in life.  For someone not familiar with the 1960's the sophistication is even more impressive for an album made way back in early 1966.<br />It is hard to say which Album is the best.  I will say for me, I personally find this album tied with...or just above the Beatles RUBBER SOUL and slightly above REVOLVER which I view as the 3 all-time great Rock &amp; Roll albums.<br />I recommend this album to any serious music listener...it will provide a treasure trove of enjoyment.<br />I also suggest for someone who loves this album to buy the box set &quot;Pet Sounds Sessions&quot;.  It shows beautifully how the album was constructed.  I often play it more than the original album.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|it seems to me the only people that like this cd are people w/ little or no taste...ie, people who didnt like previous slipknot cds....which means your some little pansy listening to the new metallica cd like youre all hard...whatever...once a band gets too deep in the record company pockets they are worthless...<BR>[...]
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac made Radiohead one of my favorite bands. There are such powerful musical arrangements on every song, and on many there are strings and horns. The &quot;pyramid song&quot; is a hauntingly beautiful song. There is such a range of emotions poured into this album.I would highly recommend it, as well as all other Radiohead albums.
0780626966|5.0|Hey! I thought this is an awsome set. However, #'s 2 and 3 aren't really that great. Other than that, it's still worth the money!
B00005JM02|2.0|this movie is something that if it was silent it would be a work of computer generated art.  But the words just mess it up dory is one of the most annoying characters ever created.  Albert Brooks does an okay job as the worrying overprotective father and I like the turtles but otherwise this movie is for the 8 and under set(even though my friends like it they think its adorable) this movie if immedialatley after you see a puppy dog in a toliet paper commercial you go AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The best start to the best saga in motion picure history
B000001FFJ|5.0|This album is amazing. From start to finish, no other Waits' album more clearly defines his talent and expertise. This is a disc you will want to hear for many years to come. I have owned it for more than a decade and I still play it every so often. Waits has a unique voice and his lyrics are unlike anything you've ever heard. If you love this as much as I do, check out Frank's Wild Years, Mule Variations, and Bone Machine for more of his best stuff.
B000002H33|5.0|YES, THERE WAS LED ZEP'S &quot;KASHMIR&quot;  AND AC-DC'S &quot;BACK IN BLACK&quot; SONGS THAT GOT ME INTO ROCK WHEN I WAS JUST A KID, BUT THEN SOMETHING NEW CALLED METALLICA HIT ME IN THE HEAD AND GOT INSIDE MY EARS, AND IF YOUR NEW TO THIS BAND (HOPE YOUR NOT), TRY LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FIRST AND THEN LISTEN TO KILL EM' ALL , RIDE THE LIGHTNING AND GARAGE DAYS RE-REVISITED. IF YOU THEN THINK YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING MORE MAINSTREAM METALLICA, THEN LISTEN TO THEIR OTHER ALBUMS. IT'S LIKE CLIFF BURTON (THEIR  FIRST BASSIST AND MUSIC COMPOSSER-COLABORATOR) DIED AND TOOK METALLICA'S SOUL WITH HIM. I DON'T KNOW.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I've already listened to it a ton of times.  It is now my favorite album, and it's even better than her first one (and her first one was really good).  Every single song in it is so good.  I love it so much!  It's definitely worth buying.
B00005B36H|5.0|If you don't already have a HDCD player... You must acquire one. I kid you not when I say this album will be a total new experience for you with the HDCD player. The ambiance is almost tripled as the sound evenlopes your ears and cushions them like a mother would a new born. I can't help but say I feel like I am there back when they were recording this album, but anyone knows anything about TOOL knows they recorded the music and vocals at two different times. Like I said... Go get this CD and an HDCD player IMMEDIATELY!!
1400031087|4.0|As soon as I picked up this book, I was hooked.  There is an urgency about it that mirrors the anti-hero's addiction. I couldn't wait to pick it up, I couldn't put it down, I needed more (or as James Frey would say, more more more). Even the Gertrude Stein-like repetition seemed almost hypnotic. There were times when I cringed, doubled up in vicarious pain, winced at the inevitable. But the rawness and honesty of it had me enthralled. It is sparse, harsh,  uncluttered, unpretentious, unsentimental. James' rejection of the 12 step philosophy in favour of the tao te ching was an interesting twist on the tired theme of recovery. I loved it without reservation.  Its a very filmic book but all I can say is - bring on the movie.<BR>It wasn't till I read some other reviews on Amazon that I thought hmmm, maybe some of those cliche's were a little too much.... but if this book catches your eye, don't pay attention to any scathing or cynical reviews you might see.  Just read it and make up your own mind. If you have any experience with addiction, your heart will beat in time.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie, by far, is David Lynch's finest film. I was so mesmerized by the film the first time around and I went to see it two more times at the theater. The movie, to me at first, was a little hard to follow, but was rather enjoyable. The music also kept me intrigued. The movie has a great way of keeping you in suspense all the way through. It's the best 2+ hours spent watching the movie each time. If you don't have the DVD, I highly recommend that you get it. It's worth every penny spent on this fantastic film.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|First let me say that I don't listen to or buy much \\"new\\" music, I'm 32. I only stray from my favorites if I find something exceptionally good. Slipknot was one of those groups, I dismissed them at first because of the gimmick but then I heard them about 3 yr.'s. later and was hooked. They've made a few songs that I can't listen to enough times, more aggressive and just simply better than any I've heard over the past 20 yrs. I don't blame them for this album because their genius shines through on most of the tracks but production is important......Rick ruined this one. I admired Rick rubin up until this one; he started def jam with Russell and produced both system of a down records, which is the last artist that I spent money on. I listened to this album about 8 times and a few times throughout, there are guitar sections, set apart from the rest of the beat that are very soad, that's due to the production (bringing up one sound and stifling others) that's soad .....not slipknot. Then my wife who is not a fan happens to hear a verse and said \\" that sounded like the red hot chilli peppers\\" - Rick produced b.s.s.m. - at no time should a casual observer hear a verse of slipknot and mistaken it for the r.h.c.p.... Then we have the lyrics, I don't know what happened there, whoever talked them into toning it down should be let go. You don't have to keep doing the same thing time after time but I have to tell you, if this was my first exposure to them, I would dismiss slipknot like I do the others and I would not have written my first review over this. By the time the next one comes out I will probably be too old to care but this one was disapointing, I'll have to keep sweatin' out to the oldies.......................................................
B000067J1H|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The cinematography in great. And the story is even better. This movie messes with your head in a way that most movies out there cannot and will not. I had to watch it a couple of times before I understood it, and to tell you the truth I still don't completely get it--but it still kicks ass. I WANT YOU TO HIT ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I heard Slipknot were releasing a new album, I was extremely sceptical.  I hated their first two albums, which basically were a bunch of hip hop influenced noise with crappy teenage angst catch phrases serving as lyrics, so I didn't expect this to be anything different.<BR>I was wrong.<BR>Apparently all their touring with Slayer and Hatebreed has done them some good.  This cd is both metal and hardcore, there are even a few slower semi-acoustic songs on here, which really show their maturity.  The music is so much better, since they've ditched most of their industrial/hip hop influence and moved on to bigger and better things (thank God).  There are finally some solos in their music, and they f*cking shred.  Now they sound much more like a real band instead of a computer produced joke.
B000002USN|4.0|As a serious sinatrafile and having just finished reading 'Sessions With Sinatra' by Charles Granata I am amused by those people that try to put this album down. At the age of 78 Sinatra goes back to Hollywood and Vine and pulls a final ace out of the deck with this offering. It is a treat to listen to the master as he and his fine friends make magic. Patrick Williams does a superb job with the Nelson Riddle charts. I have heard it all from 1939 up to this and this is just fine!  ps..duets 2 is even better!
B0001AP12G|2.0|And when i mean &quot;burned&quot;, i mean that you should burn this CD from your friend rather than spending your hard earned $20 for this CD.  The reason why i say that is because, yes, there are some good tracks on this disc and he does have messages in his flows that you can relate to; however, 90% of the songs on this CD are crap, and sound like they were recorded in the back of a dentist's office (while getting his mouth wired shut. lol). I won't totally diss Kanye West's style though, because if you're looking for music with messages and themes that you, yourself, can relate to than this is a good CD for that- but don't expect any hard beats or crazy punch lines in his music (instrumentally and vocally). If I were you, i'd just get the Twista CD Kamikazee if you wanna hear Kanye West do raps on good beats and rhymes!
B000002JS8|4.0|Ryan should save his money to buy a dictionary..instead of &quot;almbums&quot;.As he so eloquently put it,&quot; Highway ton hell &quot; is a hard driving cd.A waste is a terrible thing to mind,Ry-Ry.
B000002J1S|5.0|I have read many of the reviews here and what possibly could I add to the ones praisng this album. is it prog or pop? i would say it`s more pop heavy than prog,becuse most of the songs are pop/rock chorus heavy with a smattering of instrumentls thrown in.This album on whole is good, solid songwriting. Unlike many of the other prog bands that delved into overindulgent instrumentals, Genesis were a songwriting collective<BR> You have a wealth of musical styles going on in the `Lamb',ranging from pop( Counting out time, carpet Crawlers),Broadway msical style(The title track),instrumentls(Hairless heart,Ravine) rock(Back in NYC),to the avant garde(The waiting Room). This is Genesis at their most creative ,and although they would go on to make some fine albums, they never were as experimental again.<BR>The concept is a coming of age story about a NYC Peurto Rican street punk named `Rael',who undergoes an out of body experience. He also realizes he has a responsibility to others such as saving his brother John.<BR>The concept is also semi-autobiographical when pertaining to Peter Gabriel`s life. Songs such as `In The Cage' is an allegeory for his frustration with the music business and The Chamber of 32 doors is a personal statement on him being torn between his family and the business suits who supposedly have his best interests at heart.<BR>Even if you cant understand the concept,look at this album as a collection of songs and instrumentals. Nearly 30 years on, the music has not dated. If you are looking to purchese an album from the Peter gabriel Genesis era, this should be your first place to start.
B00005JMSE|5.0|great action movie, good storyline and well acted.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first heard of this show I was at work, a friend of mine gave me the DVD box set to watch over my weekend, to humor them I did.<BR>Never did I think that this show would be as Fantastic as it is!!!<BR>I am now a true fan, a dyed in the wool Browncoat!!!!<BR>Please watch all the episodes, it truly takes an episode or two to get used to the world that Whedon creates, but once you do, you will not regret it!!!!!<BR>For those of you who are afraid that this is just another Buffy/Angel outlet, let me tell you, It is not!<BR>It is a unique story with a unique presentation.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Good album so far.  Need to listen to it more, but recommend album at least for its humorous slant.  Refreshing hearing people who don't take themselves so seriously.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Not only did I purchase a CD for my collection, but I bought three more as gifts.  Renee's rich voice reminds me a bit of Rosemary Clooney, and her choice of tracks for this album is incredible.  I am giving two CDs for Father's Day, one to a senior citizen and the other to my 20-something son.  This music is timeless and will be loved by many ages.  Renee Olstead is going to be a HUGE star.  Don't miss this album!
B000000W5L|5.0|It might take several listens to truly appreciate this cd, but believe me, it is worth the effort.  It is absolutely an outstanding masterpiece.  I don't typically use masterpiece to describe a body of work, but this just takes you away and melts your ear.  Like a fine wine, you will thoroughly savour this music time and time again after every listen.  At first I couldn't bear it, preferring to listen to Sticky Fingers for the rawness, but gradually moving towards Exile's dynamic and diverse bluesy fidelity.  Enjoy!  It is truly something to be appreciated and listened to over and over and over...
B00009ZYC1|4.0|Funny, Because this movie twisted almost all great films ever created.The creator of this film picked the most memorable scenes on every award winning movies, twisted it the finished product is Shrek. The mirror on the wall from Snow White, The talking Donkey from Pinocchio, Shrek and Princess Fiona from Beauty and the Beast,Dragon from Sleeping Beauty. They even got some of the moves from Crouching Tiger and Matrix when Fiona fought in the woods with Robin Hood and the thieves, which is one of my favorite scene anyway. The only original character here so far is Farquad (John Lithgow).
1592400876|1.0|For Americans, _Eats, Shoots and Leaves_ has a serious, fundamental flaw: it models the English style of punctuation, which differs in a number of ways from the American style as exemplified in the Chicago Manual of Style. Those who follow Ms. Truss's teaching will, perhaps unknowingly, violate American rules of grammar, punctuation, and style. In addition, the book is not systematically arranged or complete, so it cannot reliably be used as a reference. Many of the set-in examples are purposely wrong, so that, by contrast with CMS, a reader cannot look to the examples for guidance. In my opinion, the author's attempted humor falls short, too. Karen Elizabeth Gordon's _The New Well-Tempered Sentence: A Punctuation Handbook for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed_ is funnier, better organized, and more complete. CMS is, for the most part, the definitive reference.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|After unwrapping my new cd and listening to it all the way through for the first time, I was pretty happy with what I heard.  I like Jet's two current singles and I have to say I wasn't really disappointed with the rest of their songs either.  OK, so some songs may sound a bit repetative or blah, but basically, it's just a fun cd.  I was surprised to find out that there are so many slow songs on this cd since they market themselves as a more up-beat band.  However, the slower songs are good too.  This album isn't exactly going to turn into a classic, but you have to give some credit to Jet for making a fairly decent cd.  You should listen to Jet if you want to groove to something just for fun.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I like the movie...is very good and has lots of good material to talk about.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|It is such as treat watching an young artist mature they way Avril has.  She proved with this record that she is indeed going to be around for dome time.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|The only actor i liked in this political action thriller was John Malkovitch. I mean he is one of the greatest actors alive today and this movie shows why. I loved his other movies like 'Being John Malkovitch', 'Con Air' and 'Of Mice and Men'. The tension and anger could be felt by the charecter Malkovitch played. On the other hand, this was clearly Clint Eastwood's best preformance too. The reson why this great half and half movie didn't win an oscar is because of<br />a. The title.<br />b. Based on fictional charecters and at the same time discriminating the US Government by showing lack of professionalism.<br />c. Only three major actors.<br />d. Release date.<br />So anyway, some might say that this is just another action flick, which it is, so if you'd like to see Eastwood play a hard nosed secret agent and hunt down a humerous, serial killer physcopath played by Malkovitch, then this movie will do alright. It may be a typical movie but the good thing about movies everybody would like to see is the highly awaited climax. So watch this if you are an action fan.
B00000JCOV|5.0|WEll i dont know what everyone is saying that this stuff sucks that there a sad band. i would like to see you do better. Corey has great vocals on this cd, much anger and there is nothing better then that! The precussion idea was great. The whole cd blows me away. Some of the best tracks would be Wait and Bleed, Spit It Out, Surfaceing, Eyeless.. heck there all the best. well this is a great cd, must have for the metal heads.
B00008EYA5|4.0|Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrel star in this modern update of the 70's super cop TV show.  Overall, the film's concept was solid even if the execution wasn't so.<br />THE STORY<br />Sgt. Dan \\"Hando\\" Harrelson (Jackson) recruits and trains a team of L.A. cops for their elite S.W.A.T. division and must lead them into the field when an ultra-rich European crime leader puts out a $100 million prize to the person that gets him out of prison, of which there are MANY takers.<br />THE COOL STUFF<br />The trailers pretty much showed the great stuff.  Watching the S.W.A.T. team take on all the baddies during the SECOND HOUR of the film once the bounty is put out was probably some of THE best action you'll see in any film as the bad guys come up with bold and ingenious ways to try to collect the bounty.  Awesome stuff.<br />Best Scenes<BR> <BR>1. The helicopter attack<br />2. The motorcade attack<br />3. The Bridge Fight<br />THE CRITIQUE<br />The most frustrating thing about the movie was that it took them a WHOLE HOUR to set up the best parts.  The movie is easily broken up into two parts:  HOUR ONE focuses on Hando putting the team together and training them (which is at parts fun but otherwise blah) and HOUR TWO which focuses on them trying to deal with the guys trying to bust out the evil French cartel leader (which is when all the awesome happens).  Basically, if the team had been built up in a half hour and the next hour half focused on the S.W.A.T action the movie would have been a lot better.  The movie basically looked like a souped up TV show pilot, which would be cool on its own, but is not really there for the big screen.  To put it bluntly, the pacing was horrible, hour one was pretty boring and hour two rocked.<br />THE DVD EXTRAS<br />While the movie itself may have lacked a little the DVD extras are just light years beyond a lot of the other new releases out there, especially the sound editing features here.  Here's what we get:<br />1. Director and Cast Commentary Track<br />2. Screenwriters and Technical Consultants Commentary Track<br />3. \\"Anatomy of a Shootout\\" - 8 ½ minute featurette about filming the bank shootout scene including the contrast in camera styles (news coverage format vs. traditional screen format)<br />4. \\"SWAT - TVs Original Supercops\\" -  6 ½ minute retro featurette on the original 70's TV show including interviews with the original cast<br />5. \\"The Making of SWAT\\" - 21 minute feature on the movie including information on casting, the characters, real life SWAT training, the SWAT lifestyle and SWAT equipment.<br />6. 8 deleted scenes (mostly rubbish scenes)<br />7. \\"6th Street Bridge:  Achieving the Improbable\\" -  5 minute featurette on making the Bridge Scene including CGI and live action shots.<br />8. \\"Sound & Fury:  Sounds of SWAT\\" -  Deluxe extras including a 4 minute featurette on the sound editing for the gun fights plus various mini features on the guns used in the film including the Kimber handgun, AK-47, MP5 and M16, PLUS a sound editing breakdown on 4 scenes in the film.  AWESOME feature!!!<br />9. \\"Gag Reel\\" -  3 minute blooper reel, we've seen better...<br />10. Filmographies for Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez and LL Cool J<br />11. Trailers for \\"Bad Boys II,\\" TV Action Favorites (Charlie's Angels, SWAT, Starsky & Hutch, The Rookies and Police Woman Season DVDs), \\"Once Upon A Time In Mexico,\\" \\"Radio,\\" \\"Underworld\\" and \\"Big Fish\\" DVDs<br />THE VERDICT<br />Overall the movie itself fits in well into the weekend rental category.  The movie pacing wasn't all that but all the awesome action in the second hour will wake you up and puts this movie over into the \\"passing\\" category.  If you're into guns you'll love this movie and the DVD features make this a real keeper if you're into this stuff.  Otherwise you can just file this in the \\"okay to rent\\" category.<br />GRADES<br />The Movie:  3 stars<BR>The Extras:  5 stars<BR>Overall:  4 stars
6300214559|4.0|One of the most interesting instances of genetic and gender in the history of Western Civilization is found with the death of King Edward VI of England at the age of 15 in 1553.  Too young to leave heirs, his older half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth Tudor were both considered illegitimate because of the martial history of their father Henry VIII.  Going through the Tudor family the only other potential claimants, Mary of Scotland and Lady Jane Grey, were also female.  It seemed that God that determined that a woman would sit on the throne of England and the political question was who that woman would be.  The one with the best claim was Mary Tudor, but she was a devout Catholic and the creation of the Anglican Church had created a religious schism in England that would turn ugly with her on the throne.<br />Lady Jane first became connected with the English crown as a potential mate for young Edward, who was more interested in Mary of Scotland or another foreign princess.  Jane was supposedly betrothed to the duke of Somerset's son, Lord Hertford, but was then informed by her parents that she was to wed Guildford Dudley, the youngest son of the duke of Northumberland.  Handsome and only one year her senior, Jane did not like him and refused the marriage until her mother literally beat her into submission.  The couple were married in May of 1553 and lived apart, although the marriage was consummated the following month at the expressed command of Northumberland.  Jane was then informed that she had been named Edward's heir three days before the king's death.  Northumberland kept Edward's death a secret in order to stop Mary Tudor from claiming the crown and made a speech announcing Jane was the new queen.  Forced to accept the title, Jane dismissed the idea that her husband would be made king.  When Northumberland went forth with his army to meet that of Mary, who was marching on London, the royal council declared Mary queen and Jane's own father signed the declaration.  On November 13 Jane and Guildford we tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.  Jane believed the Queen would pardon her, but the revolt against Mary by Sir Thomas Wyatt in February 1554 hardened her heart against her enemies.  Within days Guildford was executed, with Jane being beheaded on February 11th.<br />None of this historical information consistutes a spoiler because anyone familiar with the kings and queens of England knows that there was never a Queen Jane and even those unfamiliar with the specifics of English history will be aware early on that this is going to be a tragic tale.  Even so, the 1986 film &quot;Lady Jane&quot; from director Trevor Nunn would more properly be considered a historical romance, with the emphasis more on the romance than the history as the marriage between Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) and Guilford (Cary Elwes) is turned into a tragic love story.  Jane is presented as an intellectual (you would like to see her and Elizabeth Tudor have a conversation), and given a sense of nobility in that she and her husband apparently intend to rule in their own names, not only because it will thwart the plans of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland (John Wood), but also because it is the right thing to do.  In bed they tend to talk about their idealistic plans, such as not branding men or sending them into slavery because they are starving.<br />This new version of Lady Jane's marriage and her new found political ambitions work to add to the tragedy of her execution at the hands of Bloody Mary, even though her being an unwilling pawn in the machinations of some one else's power games makes her enough of a tragic figure.  You have to appreciate the irony that these two privileged children of the British class system were idealistic friends of the common folk.  The cast features the standard collection of British character actors, with Michael Hordern as Doctor Feckenham, Mary's teacher, Jane Lapotaire as Princess Mary, Joss Ackland as Sir John Bridges, and Sara Kestleman as Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk and Jane's mother.  For me the low moment in the film is when Jane is betrayed by her father, especially since Patrick Stewart plays Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk.  Of course, both Bonham Carter and Elwes have gone on to much better films, although I was surprised that she made this after &quot;A Room With a View,&quot; one of those much better films. &quot;Lady Jane&quot; runs a bit long, especially given that Jane's &quot;reign&quot; only lasted nine days, and while the fictional romance has its moments I would hope that one day the bleak reality of what happened to this young girl becomes the subject of another film.Bridges, and Sara Kestleman as Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk and Jane's mother.

B00020HEL6|5.0|As a professional musician, pianist, and jazz band director at the middle and high school level I must say when I heard Renee sing &quot;Summertime&quot; on the Today Show Memorial Day morning I was in awe. Such an &quot;old soul&quot; in this young kid! She sings with such integrety and authenticity to the score. She breathes fresh life into standards such as &quot;Someone to watch over me&quot; and &quot;Meet me at midnight&quot; is simply amazing. She also has a phenomenal band backing her up. This is a fantastic album. You won't be disappointed. Listen to all the cuts on [...]
B000000W6F|5.0|They're better known for the sprawling double-disc &quot;Mellon Collie And the Infinite Sadness,&quot; but the Smashing Pumpkins first leaped onto the scene with &quot;Gish.&quot; It's not as epic as some of their later material, but still a vibrant, musically-polished album, and one that has the flavor of experience on the first time around.<br />Kicking off with the undulating riffs of the excellent &quot;I Am One,&quot; the Pumpkins slip effortlessly between multilayered hard rock (the mind-blowing &quot;Siva,&quot; the magnificent bass-sputtering &quot;Tristessa,&quot; the panoramic &quot;Snail&quot;) and haunting ballads (&quot;Rhinoceros,&quot; the vaguely psychedelic &quot;Crush,&quot; the sweeping &quot;Suffer&quot;) before wrapping up with the eerie &quot;Daydream.&quot;<br />It's a rare band whose music can still be so relevant so long after it first came out -- let alone still being a voice for the disillusioned. Originally released in 1991, &quot;Gish&quot; definitely established the Smashing Pumpkins as a musical force of genuine artistry, talented songwriting and musical integrity. It's hard enough to find one of those, let alone three.<br />The grinding, kinetic guitars and bass in the harder songs form a wall of solid sound, except in &quot;Siva&quot; -- there, the sound keeps dying away to complete silence, before reviving with a swirling roar when you least expect it. At the same time, Corgan tones down the guitars to a gentle acoustic strum in the more balladic songs. Jimmy Chamberlin's lightning-fast drumming is an excellent accompaniment, as is D'Arcy's bass.<br />As a songwriter, few rockers can parallel Billy Corgan; his songwriting has the quality of poetry set to rock, which aren't things you generally see together. Corgan's high, reedy voice is interwoven well into the music, giving his poetic lyrics a certain heartfelt quality. And bassist D'Arcy gets to shine with her low, sweet voice in &quot;Daydream.&quot;<br />&quot;Gish&quot; is recognizably the Pumpkins, at the roughest stage of their musical development -- but with edge, the musical force and the beauty that just needed refinement.ognizably the Pumpkins, at the roughest stage of their musical development -- but with edge, the musical force and the beauty that just needed refinement.
0064471837|5.0|This excellent book focuses around its title character, Sabriel, a young woman, almost an adult.  She has spent her life in boarding school in Ancelstierre where there is only magic near the border, while her father risked his life in The Old Kingdom, the place where magic is everywhere.  Sabriel's father is the Abhorsen, the person who puts the dead raised by Necromancers back into death, a risky job, one that comes to a person through blood right.  Now Sabriel's father is in trouble, and only she can save him using the power that lies within her blood.  She must travel into the Old Kingdom, and most probably even death, using the 7 bells of the Abhorsen and a Charter Magic sword, given to her by her father now that she must save him, unravelling other mysteries as she goes.  With the help of a dangerous free magic spirit, kept tame by the collar that binds him to Sabriel's family, and a young man Touchstone, who she saves from his wooden resting place, Sabriel must face all kinds of danger to save her father, the only parent she has ever known.  But will she make it in time, or will it be too late to save her father?  Sabriel is a brilliant book, a real page turner that leaves you running for the sequel when you've finished.  Garth Nix writes a tale that excites, and surprises, and you find yourself falling into Sabriel's world with scenes so well described you can almost see them playing before your eyes.  A great book for anyone with a love for tales of adventure, and anyone who loves a good heroine.  This is a new book that I've added to my all time favorites.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet and The Strokes, Jet and The Strokes, Jet and The Strokes, Jet and The Strokes, Jet and The Strokes, these two bands are like going back into the 80's.<br />Are you ganna be my girl and Cold hard B**** wow amazing.<BR>Look what you have done is like hearing the kings, the beatles.<br />Great Outstanding Terrific Cool Amazing= GET BORN<br />Jet isnt like most albums one good song and the rest is crap, Jet has a great tune every song.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Try as the naysayers might, they cannot knock the Strokes better than they knock themselves. Shouting about wanting to be forgotten is one self-deprecating way to kick-off a band's second album. The half-hour of music that follows is so lean and first-rate in its melodies that the irony of that first statement becomes crystal clear. The Strokes may or may not appreciate this musical label, but I feel they are a modern power pop force to be reckoned with. Songs that rock this hard and have melodies this strong are still cool, no matter what your friends may say.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Crazy movie. Crazy book. Crazy soundtrack. I'm still reading the book, but I'm in love with the movie and soundtrack. I'm all about Darren Aronofsky. Pi is genious. Requiem for a Dream is genious. Aronofsky is genious. Beautiful music. The main theme is like modernesque classical music. I love it. *You'll* love it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|this film is great. the music got you in the movie watching mood te little jokes made you laugh and the end is a real tearjerker for some.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is by far their best CD and most memorable! every song on here is amazing and speaks so true and so many people can actually relate to the lyrics Kurt Cobain wrote down and turned into instant classics. This is the best CD from Nirvana, and probably one of the top 20 best CDs of all time! Nirvana is probably one of the top 5 best bands of all time! R.I.P. Kurt Cobain!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|OMG, this album is SO much better than the previous one. Just her style of singing in this CD caught my attention; it sounded better, and more controled. It seems to me that these songs are more powerful and meaningful than the other CD. It amazes me how this one CD changed Avril's style and lyrics, but if you ask me, a 13 year-old girl, it was an awesome change. ROCK ON!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|i wasnt really a big fan of Linkin Park when reanimation came out but i still liked some of the songs, but when this CD came out i became a true fan.  I love all their songs and their music is so unique and different.  No other band out sounds like Linkin Park.  They have some of the best song lyrics ive ever heard from any band and their melodies are amazing! Easier to Run, Breaking the Habbit, and Numb are the best on Meteora and a few of the best from any of their CDs. Awesome band, awesome CD, they just rock!
B00014TJUC|5.0|I must say I'm only very familiar with \\"Regeneration\\" -his prior album-before the domestic release of this wonderful album, and I'm joyously impressed where Hannon has traveled from one album to the other. Whereas \\"Regeneration\\" was rather dramatic and bleak in its melodies and arrangements -and yet worth owning in its own right- , \\"Absent Friends\\" has managed enough of a romantic and ironic tone, at the same time, to invite listeners more successfully in.<br />The decision to let go of the band -whether economically driven, as reported, or not- seems to have freed Neil Hannon to pursue his musical vision to a fuller, unimpeded extent than its prior album did.<br />As far as I'm concerned, where Brit progressive rock was dictating the mood of \\"Regeneration,\\" \\"Absent Friends,\\" at times, evokes the spirit of Stephen Sondheim. I know ... this may sound wild or strange to you but listen to \\"Imaginary Friend\\" -where the melody turns to unexpected pleasurable places, without ever sounding premeditated- or \\"Happy Goth\\" which as much of an oxymoron as this title may sound, is very much that.<br />Actually, I could name practically every tune in the album as a personal choice, I'm that pleased and inspired by it.<br />Although, I believe Hannon is not done with his changes, I do think that he's hit a particular stride as a composer already which has converted me on a faithful follower of whatever he may do next.<br />Here's an intelligent, articulate songwriter in touch with the essence of his style, and yet there's enough of what he's gotten him fans in the past in this CD, to satisfy old and new customers.
B00006AG5N|5.0|A few years ago i hated Elvis like no one else ever could, but then i started to slowly pick up on some of his music and more and more songs were introduced to me and i now love anything and everything by Elvis and this CD is the perfect CD for ANY Elvis fan! It has all of his best! My favorites include Hunk O' Burning Love,  Heartbreak Hotel, A little Less Conversation, I Cant Help Falling In Love With You, Suspecious Minds, Hound Dog, Love Me Tender and SO many more! Elvis is truly and legend that will never die! He opened the doors for all the music today to be here..if it werent for him...we wouldnt have the music we live by today!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I enjoy the offbeat, interesting and non-mainstream but sorry...this movie is just a bore from beginning to end. There's one central \\"joke\\" which wears thin after 5 minutes (Bill and Scarlett are the recipients of a constant barrage of Japanese which, of course, they don't understand and so simply mimic back as best they can in an effort to communicate...such scenes go on forever and made me yell \\"All right...I GOT IT!\\") There's about 10 minutes of plot (will Bill and Scarlett make a love connection?) , 40 minutes of Bill looking bored and/or confused, and an hour of pulsating Japanese night life. Which is fine if you're looking for a travelogue.<br />Someone else here referenced \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" which were our exact words as we turned off the DVD player without bothering to check the extra features.  Our eyes were already too glazed over. This was at best a 30 minute short dragged out into nearly 2 hours.
0385510438|1.0|I used to LOVE John Grisham, but I found this book extremely boring and yet the perfect book to bore me right to sleep every night. I only needed to read one page each night before I was out. I can understand his other books centered around Christmas and family life being more sensitive and about feelings and stuff, but when the title comes right out and says, &quot; The Last Juror&quot; and there's a picture of a Jury table on the front cover I expect it to be as fast-paced and exciting as all of his other law books. I was very dissapointed. The summary on the inside flaps actually built it up that way, which is why I forked over the money to buy it. But, like many movie trailers, most all of the exciting parts were in the summary and the book, for the most part dragged and dragged. If you are looking for a typical fast-paced John Grisham book do not get The Last Juror. You will be highly dissapointed!
B0001WTUH6|4.0|Anything that makes a movie more exciting, and more detailed, is allright with me. Deleted scenes are one thing but to intigrate them into the movie is pretty much ok. I actually thought the scenes were gonna be stupid bloopers. They weren't. Without giving up too much, here are some details.<br />Michael tells Selene about his life in the interegation building.<br />Kraven and Erika get intimate and conspicuous.<br />There's a whole new story about why the Lycans want Michaels blood.<br />It's not everything but in the end, it all boils down to what you see. I recommend trying to find this at a rental place before buying it off Amazon.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I was highly disappointed with Iowa. I only liked out of the whole CD 2 songs. It was disappointing, and besides there was too much cussing as with the first CD. I was hoping when I heard SK was making a new album that it would be better than Iowa, and I got what I wanted. It not only is a balls out assault on the ears but it also has peaceful acoustic breaks that are very rare in metal bands. What I want to know is why did Slipknot decide not to curse on this album. To me, no cussing makes a CD so much better. There are so many good songs on this CD, that will make any fan happy. Check this CD out, it is really really good. From what I hear Stone Sour is actually a softer version of Slipknot with Corey as the singer. I will have to check it out.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|wow wow wow wow wow wow wow     the best of the 3   wow wow       piece of art  wow  aha  aha
B000089CJI|5.0|so much so that if you go to Quicktime.com and look at the trailer exclusive for the upcoming indie film &quot;Garden State&quot; you will hear TPS' &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;, if you have heard this song, then you know that it is already an amazing song, but when I saw the trailer for this movie, and I heard &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; I was so joyful, I couldn't stop myself from watching the trailer over and over again. Seriously, watch the trailer (it is the first song that plays), and if you like that song, then definitely pick up this CD, it is such a great CD.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I'm writing this review because I'm sick of people calling her a &quot;poseur&quot; and not focusing on her music. Her music has truly matured and she uses more of her vocal range. I loved Together, My Happy Ending, Don't Tell Me, and Take Me Away. Nobody's Home was also another good track. Don't get me wrong, all the tracks are very good. Her lyrics are really well written too. Overall, the Cd is really good. And people, if you're not going to talk about her music, please don't bother to write a review. So she's not punk! Whoohoo! No one really cares what your opinion of &quot;punk&quot; is anyway.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|First, I'd like to point out the fact that Avril Lavigne has never called herself &quot;Punk.&quot; To blast her and say mean things about how not punk she is is pointless, because, honestly, she knows she isn't punk. This Album has some of the weakest display of lyrics I've ever seen. Sometimes it makes me want to cut my own throat. But, the music aspect has matured a lot more nicely. Thank God for that, because the lyrics gag me. But better music...And thank the Lord for no Skater Boi.....
B0001UL7RY|1.0|It doesn't say a lot for the integrity of Avril Lavigne's work when her fans, specifically these Avril-Lavigne-hater-haters, can do little to properly construct a sentence. All things grammatical aside, it needs to be said that Avril Lavigne is mediocre at best. Long has she been hailed as a punk rock queen, however this is not so. Those who make such remarks have a musical taste that obviously doesn't surpass the realm of Music Television. How did Avril Lavigne end up being classified as punk to begin with? Really, though her style of dress is admittedly unique among the typical scantily clad pop divas and blingy-blinging rap artists, it's not something to be revered. Honestly, wearing a tie isn't that big a deal.<br />If you're thinking of buying this album, I ask you to reconsider, especially if you're under the impression that Avril Lavigne is one of the great female rock artists of our time. There are bands out there, other than what you see on any top20 countdown. If you're interested in female rock 'n roll check out the &quot;riot grrrl&quot; movement of the '90s, with bands like Bikini Kill and Brat Mobile, or even popular bands of today like The Donnas and the Sahara Hotnights.<br />If you like dull thoughtless lyrics, and yes I've read them, by all means throw your money away on this album. If you want to expand your horizons and actually learn something about music take the time to explore the possibilities. There's no need to be a slave to the corporate exposure of artists who's sole asset is their sellability.
B000003S09|5.0|This KC masterpiece has been a standard in my collection - one that just does not collect dust like so many things this old (and younger!).  The remaster makes us bong-ers appreciate the finer points of this CD that is a head trip from start to finish.  It really set the standard for so much progressive rock, even today with bands like Dream Theater and Spock's Beard.  Always nice to hear the REAL thing, albeit for the umteenth time - heck, a masterpiece is a masterpiece.  And a great foundation for other prog rockers to build upon.<br />Get it NOW if you don't own it - and revel in the fact that they took the time for a remaster of the classic!!!!

B000148KK2|1.0|Songs stink, arrangements stink, album stinks. What's different? Songs by that immortal composer...Elvis Costello!!?? Gimme a break! Quick, folks, name a great song written by this guy. OK, then, name me ANY song written by this guy? She'd do better doing songs by the REAL Elvis. What happened to Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington? Can any of you imagine Sinatra, Ella, Sarah, Billie, Dinah, or Carmen McRae wanting to record any of this junk? I can't. I guess she figures that since she married the guy, she needs to boost his ego a bit. His songs stink, Diana! She can still play and she can still sing and the players are great, but even using those great ingredients, it still adds up to a bad product.
B00005JMX4|5.0|\\"The Girl Next Door\\" is a really fun movie. It is a movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. It is often hysterical and the performances are genuinely good. The beautiful Elisha Cuthbert is terrific as is Emile Hirsch and the rest of the cast. The premise and plot are really good. I mean what adolescent male would not consider a beautiful porn star moving next door an answered prayer? Overall \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is an excellent movie for its genre. It's damn good and really fun.
B00006AW2M|5.0|Yes this collection has taken a huge beating from the critics stick but it is truly a time capsule in itself. This is the first self produced effort by the Stones having fired Loog Oldham and though the songwriting seems stressed the sound is awsome.Brian Jones erupts on this album exploring no less than 15 instruments all the while suffering 2 nervous breakdowns,2 drug busts and having his chick stolen by own band member Keith.<BR>The new production and studio freedom does bring out some different beats by Watts.<BR>All in all it was a benchmark for the band which ultimatly transformed them into the sado/freak group we found on singles like J.J.Flash and the Beggars Banquet album.
B00006BNDI|5.0|This album is commonly (and, in my opinion, justly) cited as Black Metal's defining moment. However, considering the kind of music that passes for black metal these days, I can imagine this assertion causing no end of confusion among fans of today's &quot;symphonic black metal&quot; bands. Most likely such fans, upon listening to Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, will be left scratching their oh-so-evil little heads and asking themselves, &quot;Where are the gothic melodies? Where are the  tempo changes? Where is the evil satanic imagery? And why do none of these songs have choruses that I can sing along and play air-guitar to?&quot; <br />The fact is that this album is called &quot;definitive&quot; for the very reason that it strips away all of these preconceived aesthetic notions of what black metal *should* be, and focuses instead on the basic compositional and ideological foundations underlying the original Black Metal movement. This extremely purified approach looks back way beyond the birth of the Corpse-Paint-And-Satan movement, to a time when music was experienced as a direct expression of emmotion, before such developments as formalised musical theory, stylistic divisions, &quot;scenes&quot; and mass-media started teaching us how music ought to sound. That Burzum manages to communicate such a universal message within the confines of such a limited genre as Norwegian Black Metal (and whlie espousing a particularly elitist philosophy - see any interview with him) is the true measure of his talent. This album is by no means only for the &quot;hardcore&quot; or the &quot;true BlackMetalers&quot; or any such rubbish; on the contrary, I would say that Burzum is readily accessible to anyone willing to step out of his comfort zone and accept it on its own terms. To these people, I give this CD the highest possible recommendation. Just don't expect to &quot;get&quot; it right away, as it may take a while to figure out where Varg is coming from  before you can start to see where he's taking you.
B000002H97|1.0|Not that this band was ever any good or ever will be,this is their 2nd worst effort next to the last over-rated noise re-tread they released.One star for I guess if ya get drunk and turn it up maybe you can prtend yer cool.
B0000669JL|5.0|All the songs on this cd are amazing. This is the by far the best reggae cd i own and is great. Bob Marley has unfortunately already died, but he lives on through his music. This is the best single cd of his that you can buy, not all of that greatest hits crap, this is the best cd, so go buy it A sap.

B0001WTUH6|4.0|First off, Underworld is a four star movie.  That's what the rating's for.  But this &quot;uncut&quot; extended version?  Why bother?  I barely noticed any difference.  There were three scenes or so that I noticed were different, but they didn't really ad much of anything.  Honestly I can't see how they cut this down to the regular version and felt both deserved to be released.  It amounts to pretty much the same thing as those two versions of Highlander 4 - ie, a little different, but in the end the same thing.<br />It was longer, I noticed that.  But there were no major additions like the long versions of, say, The Abyss, T2, Waterworld, Lawnmower Man, Joy Ride, Aliens, etc.  Now those were some serious extended cuts that added major subplots or entirely different story lines.  The regular version is simply a finely trimmed down version of this one.  Dissapointing.<br />But the package is way cool.  So are the two books that come with it.  But really, if they wanted to mess with this, it should have been a single package with the first movie.<br />And the Fangs vs Fiction &quot;documentary&quot; is just silly and missleading.  It's just an elaborate promo for the movie.  For one thing, the word &quot;lycan&quot; was introduced by... Underworld!  Yet they try and pass it off like real terminology.  Secondly, many of the werewolf history details are wrong, like junk about full moons and silver bullets (both of which are 20th century concepts).<br />Like most DVDs, the seperate featuretes repeat lots of stuff and could have easily been edited into one longer feature. And it's only got one of the two trailers for the movie.<br />If you don't own Underworld, I guess get this one.  But in the end it doesn't really matter.  I hope they have a really good explaination on the commentary track.
B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie is to underated to be one of the greatest
B000088E6D|4.0|Michael Buble's self titled album is a 4 star album. He tries to sing not only standard jazz tunes but also some pop tunes. He has a very good voice, especially for jazz and it seems with this album he is in his element. Most of the album is good, but at points it does loose a bit of excitement when the mood slows down. Overall, good song selection makes this a great album along with Buble's voice. 4 stars.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot had long been a target of mockery for me, what with there stupid costumes, excess members and ridiculous pseudo-badass fans.  But, in spite of this I'd been a bit curious about hearing what they actually sounded like.  Of course, I had heard some, and it generally wasn't all that impressive, but just hearing some songs on the radio every now and then is no way to become acquainted with a bands material.  Wait and Bleed was rather annoying and ridiculously repetitive, but there other stuff was better, particularly what I'd hear from Iowa  every now and then on a local metal show. Not amazing, but decent enough anyway. Still I couldn't get over my natural aversion to them, or the embarassment involved in actually buying a Slipknot album until I saw that they had a new album which was on sale for rather cheap.  It turned about to be worth it.<br />As far as style goes, this is Nu-Metal, but that term doesn't mean too much in specific, and they aren't truly typical of it either, so I'll expound a bit.  It's more riff-oriented than your average nu-metal album, and the songwriting is usually centered around the cycling of the riffs.  Of course, they still have interludes and atmospheric pieces and whatnot, but they aren't as prevalent.  Perhaps more significantly, they tend to play actual riffs, rather then formless walls of noise.  They got lots of starting and stopping in the riffs and a bit of formless blurring, but still a nice amount of rhythmic, controlled rhythm work.  Clearly, these guys actually listened to some death and thrash metal in their day, and took more away from it than just that it was loud.  Of course it's got your mandatory detuning,(sounds like drop C to me, though I'm not good at hearing that sorta thing) which makes the guitars flatter and less noisy, which I don't like.  They also provide some very cool licks, and a couple fairly good solos. They've got two electronics guys, but they generally don't detract, and actually help, particularly on the ballads.  They generally have a supporting role, where they are acceptable, and texture the guitarwork.(rather then providing the main melody, as they do in a lot of your wussier nu-metal) I really like the drumming.  It's easy to mock their having a drummer and 2 percussion guys, but it sounds real good.  It's got great production with a real sharp, punchy sound, which is quite different from what you usually hear.  Lotsa great fills, and some nice, percussion centered marching parts.  Taylor is actually a pretty good vocalist.  He's toned it down a bit, as he used to use a more holwly/growly voice, which has been replaced by shout-singing and distorted yelling and screaming.  I like this, largely because I hear singers growling all the damn time, so it just adds variety.  His melodic singing is pretty good, surpising since I didn't care for it on Bother.(Though he inflected his voice on that song in a which he never seems to here)<br />The more straightforward, driving metallic songs provide the core of this album, and are quite solid.  The Blister Exists, Three Nil and Duality are the best of them, and they are excellent.(which leads to some pacing problems, as those are tracks 2-4) They're all very energetic and catchy, mixing intensity and melodicism quite well.  Welcome, Opium of the People and Before I Forget are much the same as those 3 songs, but weaker across the board. Still solid, enjoyable tracks, but not to amazing.  Pulse of the Maggots is the weakest of the straitforward tracks.  The chorus bites, it's got a lame intro and the rest of the some is decent but unremarkable.  Not really bad, but it probably shoulda been cut.  The 3 ballads are pretty good. Circle is by the best.  It has an excellent use of electronics, with a surpisingly dense arrangement topped off by solid vocal melodies.  Vermillion Pt. 2 and Danger - Keep Away are weaker but still worthy additions to the albums.  Vermillion pt. 2 is essentially Circle lite, but it works.  Danger - Keep Away is very moody, with extensive and effective use of vocals harmonies.  A nice, if odd, coda to the album.  Finally, we have the oddball tracks.  Prelude 3.0 is pretty cool.  Slow, but with effective atmosphere some grinding guitars and nice vocal work. Vermillion is really weird, but one of the best tracks on the album.  The first 2 mintues are just so-so, but it really picks up there, with some nice nu-thrash riffing, effective sampling/electronics, a good solo and a truly haunting ending.  The Nameless is another of the best tracks.  Some good riffing, and an extremely effective and unexpected acoustic chorus, and another powerful ending.  The Virus of Life is unlike anything else here, and it doesn't really work very well.  It has a more electronic and industiral edge, and tries to be ominous, but largely fails.  It's still kinda interesting, though.<br />So, I like this. The image is lame, and the lyrics are pretty weak, but it's pretty varied and pretty catchy while still being fairly intense.  Good stuff<br />Lastly, lots of people have complained about Slipknot's wussing out on this album.  My relatively small exposure to their earlier work suggests that they have done this. Fortunately, I have good news for all those concerned with this development: In the last 15 years, there have been a million Death Metal albums released which are far heavier then Slipknot ever were. You can go buy one of those.Danger - Keep Away is very moody, with extensive and effective use of vocals harmonies.  A nice, if odd, coda to the album.  Finally, we have the oddball tracks.

B00006AW2J|5.0|Let it Bleed seems to me more like its poking fun at Let it Be than trying to rip it off.  Not to mention Let it Bleed is a whole lot better a song, in my opinion.  And Sitars, gotta be copying the Beatles if you use one of those, that's why all of India is rocking the John Lennon haircut.  I always found the Stones to be a whole lot better than the Beatles...and considering that they didn't implode after John Lennon's death, I'd say they've got some of their own talent.<br />This album is great.  Though as many people have said, not their greatest album.  If you like the Stones though, even a little, I would recommend buying this.
0679424741|4.0|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. Highly recommended.<br />Only 23 when she wrote The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers captures the restless energy of adolescence and the loneliness and isolation of those who choose not to fit into their world-Mick Kelly, an artistic teenager whose titles and graffiti reveal a darker side to her personality; Jake Blount, an itinerant socialist; Benedict Mady Copeland, a consumptive black physician; and Biff Brannon, owner of the New York Caf&eacute;. Linking this disparate group of outsiders is the ironically named John Singer, a man who cannot talk (or sing). They are drawn to him, as lonely people are to someone they believe will listen and understand. They never step out of themselves to discover that Singer listens, but he doesn't understand, nor do they realise that he, too, is lonely and isolated-or why.<br />Just as these four impose their concept of Singer upon him, he has his own idol-his companion of 10 years, Spiros Antonapoulos. While Singer's lonely friends project upon him the character of a wise, knowing, understanding man, Singer in turn imposes a similar personality on Antonapoulos. His life revolves around his rare visits to the asylum to which Antonapoulos is eventually taken. As the reader's awareness of Antonapoulos as a childish, greedy, and lazy man grows, so grows Singer's faith in him as gentle and wise. As a fellow mute, Antonapoulos is all Singer has, so he both idealises and idolises him-in the same way that Mick, Blount, Copeland, and, to a lesser extent, Brannon idealise and idolise Singer.<br />Rarely do any of the four interact, except when Blount and Dr. Copeland engage in a circular argument about how best to help their peoples-victims of capitalism in Blount's case, blacks in Dr. Copeland's. These two groups have much in common, but just as Blount and Dr. Copeland remain in bitter conflict, so do their peoples-a conflict which is alluded to throughout and which culminates in a brawl at the carnival grounds where Jake works. Dr. Copeland and Jake never find common ground, nor do the poor white laborers and oppressed blacks they wish to enlighten. Dr. Copeland's self-sacrificing but hopeless dedication and Jake's self-destructive brutality could be seen as representing their time and place, the 1930s South.<br />Sexual ambiguity pervades the novel. It is never clear whether Singer and Antonapoulos are lovers, although it seems like that that is what lies behind Singer's uncritical devotion. Even when Antonapoulos's selfish, greedy, irrational behaviour drives away a third mute, Singer is merely disappointed at the loss of a potential friend-as long as he has Antonapoulos, he is content. After Antonapoulos leaves, \\". . . in the spring a change came over Singer . . . his body was very restless . . . unable to work off a new feeling of energy.\\"<br />This sexual energy is shared by Mick, who is always restless. This isolates her even more from the rest of her family: her father, a disabled carpenter trying half-heartedly to make a living; her mother, for whom Mick acts as a substitute parent for her younger brothers Bubber (George) and Ralph; her older brother Bill, once close to her and now distant; and her older sisters Hazel and Etta, who have been forced from adolescence into adulthood through work and their own conventional interest in celebrity. (One could speculate about the nature of the \\"diseased ovary\\" Etta develops.)<br />Mick lives in an \\"inside room,\\" where she finds peace in music and in her perceptions of her friendship with Singer. Later, after her sexual initiation, she finds herself slyly manipulated into taking a job by her apparently solicitous family; at this point, she notices that, while the \\"inside room\\" is still important, she has less time and energy for it. McCullers exposition of Mick's transition from inventive childhood to dulling adulthood is subtle and is one of the best aspects of the novel.<br />Of the four, Brannon is the most enigmatic. After his wife dies, he redecorates in what seems a distinctly unmasculine way (in contrast to his heavy, black beard, the subject of many comments). Even more interesting, he begins to wear his late wife's perfume. While he observes, defends, and supports Jake, his sexual feelings are focused on Mick, to whom he seems distant and cold (in her naivet&eacute;, Mick attributes his attitude to the fact that she and Bubber shoplifted gum from the caf&eacute;). Not surprisingly, after Mick is sexually initiated, obtains a job, and begins to dress and behave more like a girl on the cusp of womanhood, Brannon loses interest and consequently warms up to her. She is now no more of a challenge to his impotence than his late wife was.<br />McCullers weaves a dense cloth of themes. First, there is the inward and selfish nature of loneliness. No one ever truly reaches out; in fact, Mick's Jewish neighbor Harry, appalled by fascism and Hitler, and Brannon are the only characters who are interested in the greater world. The conditions of the working poor and the black experience are eloquently portrayed without much narrative or focus on details. By the end, everything and nothing has changed. Mick is determined to escape fate through music, unlikely as it seems; a weakened Dr. Copeland becomes unable to carry on his \\"strong, true purpose.\\" Blount leaves town to find someone who will finally accept the basket of ideas that haunts his nightmares; Brannon, \\"suspended between bitter irony and faith,\\" faces the dawn exactly as he has for years.<br />McCullers' portrayal of these disparate characters are true to life and reveal a remarkable insight into people, no matter their age, gender, race, or background-an insight that is lacking in her self-absorbed characters. The heart is a lonely hunter, so it will find what it wishes to-love-in the most unlikely of places. It would take many re-readings to mine the richness here.<br />Diane L.

B0001UL7RY|3.0|I'm not an Avril hater, infact, I am a fan of her, but just not hardcore. I do own her first CD and I really like it. The first single from 'Under My Skin' is 'don't tell me'. Now, Avril has been away for two years, so for her return i expected something to cement her as a legitimate talent. 'DTM' is so very mediocre, and it is childish. This song sounds like a B-side to 'Let Go' or an album track, not a single, especially not a comeback single!! So i listened to every new song on 'UMS' on MTV the leak to see if i wanna buy it, and oh my god!! her lyrics are so juvenile!! the girl is like 19 now, and the lyrics are just not good. the melodies to her songs are so pop structured with little rock twists and turns here and there. this CD is not bad, it's just not that good. but it doesnt really matter how many haters she has, or people saying she sucks and she's not punk (like all that matters! come on, enough with the punk think, let it go), the girl is selling over 400,000 copies alone in the US, and she's going to be #1 in the US and UK. so all the haters must congratulate, but still, she's really not that good.

1400034205|5.0|The Razor's Edge is a tale of one man (Larry) who was born and brought up in US, spend many years in Europe, first flying aircrafts in WW I and later living an idiosyncratic existence where he searched for purpose and ambition through books, languages and labor. He later travels to India, and finds solace in the Hindu philosophy, where he also learns how to medidate and be at peace with oneself and the world. Maugham writes a very accurate and engaging account of Hinduism.<br /><br />The novel explores the relationship of various people. The author as a part of story travels in and out of the life of Larry and his friends, and through several conversations that occur intermittenly recreates the story of Larry, Isabel, Gray, Elliot and Sophie. Isabel loves Larry, but Larry's insistance on choosing to loaf and search for the meaning of life and his purpose (and hence living a poor life) and marries Gray, the multimillionaire. Without divulging much details of the story, one can say that the author does a good job in making his characters real and interesting, and presents through them an array of human emotions.<br />The Razor's edge is also a social commentary, and Maugham opens a window into the lifes and times of early twentieth century Upper classes, their constant striving for popularity and for materialistic pleasures, their hopes, and failings. The story is written in a sentiment and style that makes this discussion and critique on classes as invisible score playing somewhere in background.<br />In modern context of the philosophy of science, as say Capra in his Tao of Physics points out, or read Complexity by Waldrop, Eastern and especially Indian ageold wisdom and philosophy resonantes with the new contexts and paradigms in science. The paradigms of having cycles of existence, of evolution and coevolution, of each and every action of every creature affecting everyone else (Butterfly Effect), of uncertainity and unpredictability. Some sentences about Hinduism are particularly well written, say quoting from the book &quot; Can there be anything more stupendous than the conception that the universe has no beginning and no end, but passes everlastingly from growth to equilibrium, from equilibrium to decline, from decline to dissolution, from dissolution to growth, and so on till eternity?&quot;<br />Larry's description resonates with the beliefs and ideas I was taught while growing up in India. And since I have stayed in US for three years now, I guess I read into novel the kind of questions that I have faced: choice between materialism and spiritualism, choice between love and ambition, between my own country and the land of opportunity, of religion and beliefs! If you are a wanderer, and faced with such questions of life and reality, maybe you will love this book as much as I did!<br />It ain't only a love story, does not mean it isn't a good love story.

B000002H97|5.0|Released in 1991, Metallica(Christened the Black Album because of its rather dark cover) went straight to the top of the Billboard Charts, ironically knocking off fellow Thrashers Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction off the top. It eventually stayed at the #1 position for over 4 weeks, quickly reaching Multi-Platinum sucsess. Over time, it spawned the Top 40 hits &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;. Also you will hear the songs &quot;Sad But True&quot; and  &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; quite frequently on the radio. For those reasons, the Black Album became one of the most sucessful albums of the 90's, and quite possibly the Most Sucsessful Metal album of all time in the proc ess. Granted, this album is nowhere near as epic or beautiful as Metallica's earlier records, such as Master of Puppets or ....And Justice For All, but nonetheless it's a magnificent album in its own right. Before Metallica added grunge to their sound with albums like Load and Re-Load, they were one of the most influential bands of their time, basically molding and shaping the Metal genre of Thrash, which includes such classic bands as Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, Anthrax, Exodus, and the lesser-known Metal Church. Metallica blended the speedy guitar riffs of Judas Priest and made them even faster, added James Hatfield's somber and superb vocals, and Lars Ulrich's frantic drumming created perhaps the best metal band of the 80's, and possibly ever. But with The Black Album, Metallica slowed up just a little, incorporating ballads like &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, but in no way lost their original thrash style, which showed in classic songs like &quot;Sad But True&quot;, &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;, and &quot;The God That Failed&quot;. It is completely perpostrous that Metallica sold out with this album, they just put in two ballads! That in no way changed their sound, but in fact deepened it, showing that they weren't just pigeonholed into a certain type of metal. Even if they don't like to admit it, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; make up two of the strongest songs on this album. In fact, Metallica really never sold out until they tried to achieve mass appeal with all the Nu-Metal losers with St. Anger, one of the worst examples of a great band degrading as they went along, falling in with other degraded bands such as Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Megadeth, Anthrax(When they incorporated rap), Black Sabbath, and even Ozzy Osbourne.<br />The Black Album IS the album to get if you are trying to get into Metallica, as you will instantly fall in with Kirk Hammett's masterful guitar solos and James Hatfield's growling vocals, and then you should go on to purchase all of their older material with a more open mind towards complex song structures and even grander guitar solos. Without a doubt in my mind, Kirk Hammett is the best guitar player out there, with his masterful solos and how he can hold up a song all by himself, and James Hatfield's signature growl makes him one of the best vocalists around, Lars Ulrich is a consistent and excellent drummer, and Jason Newsted on bass is underrated and always solid and tight. In fact, Newsted's work on the Black Album may be better than Cliff Burton's excellent work, with such great bass intros as on &quot;My Friend Of Misery&quot; commonplace. Kirk Hammett's excellent guitar work is evident on such songs as &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;, &quot;Through The Never&quot;, and &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot;, which contain some of the most memorable solos of Hammett's career, probably the best one coming off &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, but his guitar playing on The Black Album is only a taste of the greatness that once was. James Hatfield's lyrics are superb throughout, with such well-written songs as &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;, and &quot;The God That Failed&quot; some of his strongest ever. Overall, every song is a classic, with every song being good, with &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; being slightly downgraded because it's so repetitive, but it's still a great song!<br />Best Songs: &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;-How do you not like it?

B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets, upon its release in 1987, was heralded as one of the Greatest Metal albums of all time, and possibly THE Best. Although not very popular commercially at the time, after the release of The Black Album, many people began to peruse Metallica's older stuff, and many people began to spread that Master of Puppets was the greatest metal album of all-time. Granted, Master of Puppets is a GREAT album, but I think Ride The Lightning and ...And Justice For All are simply better because the songs are so much more complex and less repetitive. Master of Puppets still stands as one of Metallica's best, and sadly was their last album with bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a tragic car accident(At least he died respectfully and not of an overdose!), and he will always be remembered for his great work from Kill 'Em All through Master of Puppets. Below you will find a song by song review, although there are no bad songs!<br />Battery:10/10- Simply a thrash classic, one of the fastest songs you will ever hear chockfull of masterful solos by Hammett! Lyrics are slightly lacking, but that can be forgiven!<br />Master of Puppets:10/10- An undeniable classic, this contains one of Hammett's most memorable riffs and probably Lars' best drumming ever! Hatfield's vocals truly shine! Around 3:30 in, the song adds a solo from Hammett that is truly brilliant!<br />The Thing That Should Not Be:9/10- Gets one point lower because Lars is on vocals(Simply not as good as Hatfield) and gets a little repetitive. Insanely good lyrics and an absolutely insane solo from Hammett!<br />Sanitarium:10/10- One of Metallica's most loved songs, it starts off slow, and then picks up to become one of the hardest songs on Master of Puppets. Hammett is truly at his peak here, as this song contains about 3 epic solos! Great chorus, it's too bad Lars sings most of the song!<br />Disposable Heroes:10/10- If you thought that Lars Ulrich or Cliff Burton are overrated, just listen to the beginning of this song! Classic Thrash from Metallica, fast with no holds bared. Great chorus, one of the most memorable on Master of Puppets! Gets a bit repetitive, but Hammett's solo all but makes up for it!<br />Leper Messiah-10/10- One of my favorite Metallica songs, all the instruments are played masterfully! Really great lyrics and vocals from Hatfield respectfully! Really great solo from Hammett about 4 minutes in!<br />Orion(Instrumental)-10/10:Probably the reason they played this song at Cliff Burton's Funeral is mainly because of how it single-handedly shows that Burton was one of the best bassists of our time. This is probably my favorite song on this album, because we get 8 beautiful minutes of unadulterated Hammett solos!Very epic in its scale, it goes from very dark and heavy to light and airy, and I just love that!<br />Damage, INC.-10/10: Along with Battery, Damage, INC is the fastest song on Master of Puppets, and Hatfield does an admirable job of keeping up with the pace. Really great solo from Hammett, but when is there not!<br />Overall, every song is great, and this album is perfect, yet it isn't quite as good as ...And Justice For All or Ride The Lightning, which are just PHENOMENOMALLY GOOD! Personally, my favorite song is Orion, but Battery, Master of Puppets, and Sanitarium aren't close behind! Hammett truly shines in this album, but he reaches his creative peak with ...And Justice For All. Without a doubt, Master of Puppets has the best lyrics for any Metallica album, and it shows just how genuis Hatfield is at making up lyrics.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! IF YOU'RE A FAN OF METAL YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE THIS(Shame on you if you don't!) AND IF YOU'RE A FAN OF ROCK IN GENERAL I SEE NO WAY YOU WOULD NOT LIKE THIS!

B0001WTUH6|4.0|I really loved the original so when I heard there was an extended version I just had to get it. While some of the additions are insignificant, others are very significant. Over all, it adds to the exposition and creates a smoother flowing narrative and a clearer picture of this world. Some dumb movie executive probably ordered the cuts just because it was too long for those who have a short attention span. If not for the DVD format we might not have seen this as it was intended. I would probably give it 4 and a half stars if it were an option. But, I just cannot quite give it 5 because of Bill Nighy and Shane Brolly's C- performances. As for the second disc I never watch that stuff. I'm sure I'm not the only one though.
B000268QB2|4.0|I just got Hopes and Fears and I think it's a great album!!!I'd definitely recommend it!
B0001GL3K4|1.0|This movie seemed to be more of a patchwork of poorly scripted, barely coherent flat characters. At times it seemed like a multi-cultural ad campaign put together by a dimwitted government agency that really doesn't understand any culture at all. Its sickening sentiments which substitute, mostly, for real love are a nightmare of shallow goop.<br />It is, without a doubt, one of the worse films, with some of the best stars, that I've ever seen. One bright light was Emma Thompson. But then, she barely has to walk into a scene and she's already raised the bar for everyone involved.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|As a child, I was not allowed to watch this TV movie. As an adult, it wasn't available until May 18, 2004. I bought a copy and watched it avidly. It was worth the 20 year wait.<BR>The screenplay is well written, the acting is good considering very few Americans even understood the concept of nuclear war at the time (Hiroshima, Nagasaki conveniently forgotten).<BR>I was disappointed that they really didn't show the effects of &quot;nuclear winter&quot; or the true effects of radiation sickness but I was pleased that it wasn't too technical (I know my nuclear terminology, but don't want to hear it while watching a movie).<BR>Overall a very good portrayal of what could (will?) happen - although now it's not so much the Russians as.......well, who?
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay COULD have been just like all of the other bands of the past ten years. Thank God they're not.<br />I find more quality in PRE Nirvana rock, and even Radiohead took awhile until I found the magic in it. No, I'm not middle aged - I'm in my early twenties. The past years of the industry has produced bland forgettable band after another. In some ways, I'm scratching my head as to why I don't share that same opinion towards Coldplay - but I suppose it's good to have a little mystery in life.<br />The album is a set of quality tender songs in disguise as your traditional verse-chorus Brit-pop songwriting. You see, track 7, the title track of all numbers, is under a minute. And a song that is actually longer than that is at the very end and not even given a track listing. In fact, one thing I picked up on is how Coldplay writes a song that is done when the song says it's done, not when the record execs say so. Several songs (and most songs on their followup CD) go 4 or 5 minutes or more. It seems so ridiculous to note that nowadays, mainstream song clips are barely over 3'30''. People's attention spans have shrunk amazingly, and I think Coldplay may have a good remedy for the problem. This was the first bit of evidence about &quot;good songwriting&quot; that entered my subconscious mind when I was exposed to the single &quot;Yellow&quot; on TV/radio. Make no mistake, this is VERY intelligent music. The band knows how to expose their souls and still be able to package it in a way that won't alienate themselves from the world.<br />I don't know what it was, but I bought both of their albums, and find myself addicted. While the songs seem simple, there's much going on beneath the surface, and I think this is why the band may have a successful tenure ahead of them. At the bottom of the depths of all of it is the naked emotion displayed by Chris Martin. He presents himself as VERY sincere, which hopefully won't make him vulnerable to the constantly shifting tides of the music industry. Next level up, the CHORDS!!! YAY!!! Ladies and Gentlemen, may I direct your attention to &quot;Yellow&quot; itself, &quot;Sparks,&quot; or basically any other song - there's nothing too arrogantly sophistocated about the songs, but check out the guitar parts - they are very carefully constructed and exquisitely arranged. So, while the rest of the world thinks that the key to the next millenium is a bunch of programmed drum loops and studio trickery, Coldplay is busy evolving music by actually making music. Who would have thought? Next level up - the atmosphereic sonic paintings. I think this is the reason that you get a little extra of your money's worth. This IS an album where you pick up something with each new listen, and you don't have the whole thing memorized after just one spin. It's so easy to get caught up in the mood (and that's a good thing!), you may forget there are other components at work here! But take your time - this cd and this band aren't going anywhere.<br />Even on the surface, there's no debris. The lyrics are intelligent and real. One thing about Radiohead (since everyone seems to be comparing them) is that I feel they go out of their way sometimes to be so cryptic, they introvert themselves to the point where they are even hiding from their own fans - but as for Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes,&quot; there's a warm feeling that you can relate to the songs and the lyrics. A HUMAN element, that sadly, music seems to have all but lost. I mean, how about the line in &quot;We Never Change&quot; - &quot;I want to live my life/and have friends around.&quot; I think it was Roger Waters who said, if the lyrics seem so obvious and simple and you're about to toss them in the trash can, that's when you put them on the record instead.<br />Probably a personal favorite would be the almost gospel-like closer (minus the choir) &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot;, reminding me of the superior &quot;hang in there you'll be alright&quot; attitudeof Bon Jovi's &quot;Livin' On a Prayer.&quot;<br />In closing, what I said about the last track is probably the reason the songs are so good - you can hear them in your head with a huge gospel choir or an orchestra or whatever, but if a song is really good enough, it should be able to function in a really barebones form - such as some piano, bass, and drums. I would LOVE to see these guys work with an Orchestra, I think the results would be to die for. Meanwhile, why not just be content with the best stuff that modern music seems to be able to offer us?
B00020HEG6|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.<br />PoA is my favorite of the Harry Potter books and I was hoping that the movie would do it justice.  If the movie itself follows the soundtrack's quality, I don't think people have anything to worry about.  This soundtrack is different from the previous two, but it is still distinctly from a Harry Potter film.  &quot;The Knight Bus&quot; brings in the sounds of jazz music wonderfully and I am totally in love with the &quot;Double Trouble&quot; track.  &quot;A Window to the Past&quot; deserves special mention as it is the one track that calmed me down after getting so worked up over how great the rest of the album is (sort of like &quot;Fawkes the Pheonix&quot; does for Chamber of Secrets).<br />All in all, an awesome soundtrack and I can't wait to see how the music fits in with the rest of the movie!
B00004XONN|3.0|(I'll go with 3.5 Stars)<BR>Well, you won't find much rock and roll here, that's for sure. Still, if you, like so many others, are pondering said universal question, this album does offer a whole plethora of clues.<br />There is more logic to why things happen than meets the eye. Look at Classical Music about 100 years ago. Where are you going to go? After a century saturated with epic geniuses like Beethoven and Brahms, the 20th century composers like Berg, Schoenberg, and Cowell (Check this guy out!!!), really could only go in a certain direction: the path of the experimental. Nobody was going to reinvent a Rachmaninoff Concerto and have it rival the original. Thus, 20th century &quot;classical&quot; music broke all conventional tradition, got very atonal, and alienated the majority of society. Out of need for a common denominator for the masses, simple rock and roll was born.<br />Enter the flip side of that century. Rock has gone to wonderfully excessive heights, and again, seemed to have evolved as forward as possible (by the early 90's). Man could then only take a step back, OR sideways, at best. Phew! Ok I just justified the reason for the world's need for Grunge, Boy Bands, and Hip-Hop.<br />Think I've completely gone off the deep end with the philosophizing here? Stay with me - when you think about it, there HAD to be a reason that rock had eventually failed to ignite people's interests. Think there's no parallel? Even I, of course, can't prove any of this beyond speculation, however, I can offer evidence. Look at Radiohead - and this album.<br />Radiohead - the end of Rock and Roll? That's too much of a loaded statement to touch, but I will casually note that Thom Yorke and co. have seemed to serve the musical purposes of two generations in one. Recall the more straight-forward rock achievements with &quot;Creep,&quot; &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; etc., and success became a tricky thing to handle (as it usually does). Feeling &quot;The Bends&quot; (andDEFINITELY by &quot;Ok Computer&quot; time) was as far as the band wanted to go in that direction (and I have mixed feelings about that), they took a cue from history, whether they knew it or not.<br />&quot;Kid A&quot;'s effect on rock is not that far removed from what John Cage's &quot;prepared piano&quot; pieces did to piano music. By that point, you really couldn't call it classical music anymore, and by &quot;Kid A,&quot; it's a tall order to call it an album of rock and roll.<br />But it did AFFECT rock and roll. Radiohead had lots of people paying attention, so their follow-up to &quot;Ok Computer&quot; would definitely create an impact on modern music, consciously or not. Afterall, it IS under the moniker of a rock band (vocals, guitars, bass, drums, keys) that Radiohead presented (and continues to present) new music. The early 1900's invented serialism, and the late 1900's invented Pro Tools.<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that electronica is a step in the wrong direction, but I do think that a little goes a long way. Much work, along with much creativity, has gone into creating this album. It's very experimental, and the elements of sound (and rock music) are broken down to the bare bones, arranged the way the band sees fit, and then presented as a collage of sound. Unlike most people, who either love or hate it, I'm taking a genuinely middle-of-the-road attitude towards &quot;Kid A&quot; as far as its aesthetic presentation. I don't love it, I don't hate it. I give it some stars for being gutsy and artistic, but, as Radiohead's following started becoming more of a strong hardcore following than a world domination, I would say I am somewhat affected by the understandably alienating elements. That's not to say that the band didn't want to do just that, but with a sort of &quot;average&quot; view towards this album, I think I can be particularly objective. Lack of commercial appeal doesn't automatically translate into greatness.<br />Bottom line, Ihave great respect for this product, but it still bugs me that Radiohead isn't a group of top-notch musicians - because if that were the case, this album would REALLY be something special. Instead, this is merely a &quot;Pro Tools&quot; album that proved (with later releases) not just to be a one-off. As for if all this experimenting pays off into an enjoyable album, it really comes down to personal taste. Yes, there is still much emotion to be found in Radiohead's music, but it's harder to access when hiding behind blips and bleeps. I think anyone who hasn't heard this album needs to hear it; if not to fall in love it, then for educational purposes. &quot;Kid A&quot; subtly offers much insight with regards to what happened to rock and roll. If it sounds like there's a human element lacking in this review, it's only a reflection of the material being reviewed. Nonetheless, it's necessary to hit the topic, because this album has had a larger influence on the mainstream than even the moderate amount of &quot;Kid A&quot;'s purchasers may realize.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The first album, I got just because it had wait and bleed, and I liked a few of the other songs on it. Iowa blew me away, and I thought, &quot;How could Slipknot get better?&quot; And that was just their second album. Now they release this, with the legendary Rick Rubin producing, and the newest is indeed the greatest. You can understand what corey says when he screams, the guitarists try soloing, (WHY DIDN'T THEY DO THAT BEFORE???) Joey Jordison is still the greatest drummer on earth, and a few songs are acoustic! My top 5 (in order):<br />1. The Blister Exists (Awesome Snare Solo by the percussionists)<BR>2. Circle (Good for the fans of Bother By Stone Sour)<BR>3. Duality (AWESOME VIDEO BY THE WAY!!)<BR>4. Opium Of The People (Great lyrics)<BR>5. Vermillion part 2 (Like Vermillion Part 1 except acoustic)<br />Conclusion: If you loved Stone Sour, get this CD. You'll like it. What am I saying? Get this CD anyway. It rocks the most.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|What a great album by D12. People think just becasue its D12 they are all funny but this isn't just the case in this album. <BR>The best songs are 'Just Like U', 'My Band', '40 oz' and 'The Good Die Young'If u r a fan of d12 or eminem in anyway GET THIS ALBUM
B00009EIQE|5.0|This recording is my favourite blues CD ever. Buddy's voice is smooth, full of emotion and gutsy. The backing is rich and funky. It's personal, cut from the heart.<br />I imagine it's like having him at your kitchen table and pulling out his guitar...there's not much in the way of production overlaying the acoustic sound.<br />If you like blues this should form part of your essential collection.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I love Williams, and this is a fantastic score, hinting wondrously at the original Potter score, and his own classics:<br />1. Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme)<BR>Unfortunately, this is a rather disappointing rehash of the very first Harry Potter track ever heard, and I don't think it has a true place in this score. At least in The Chamber of Secrets, the conclusion to the theme was varied.<br />2. Aunt Marge's Waltz<BR>This neo-Viennese waltz glides and soars and changes character as fast as someone struggling to dance properly. Humorous, dramatic, lively, a real delight...<br />3. The Knight Bus<BR>This is an oustanding piece, even though I don't like it as much as most people. It cleverly introduces various upcoming new themes, including the &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (From the &quot;Double Trouble&quot; cue) repeated motive in the brass, and the haunting dementors' underscore. A welcome addition, Williams returns to his Cantina Band roots as he did less skitzophrenically in Catch Me If You Can.<br />4. Apparition on the Train<BR>Again, a meld of Williams' earlier style a la Indiana Jones, and upcoming leitmotivic material, particularly &quot;Double Trouble&quot; and some of the climactic &quot;marches&quot; later on. Interesting underscore for John Williams fans, but perhaps meaningless to non-JW Harry Potter fans.<br />5. Double Trouble<BR>The dark counterpart to the Christmas carol from Home Alone, &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; with the requisite medieval instruments (recorder and tambourine etc) to suit the setting. The first major highlight of the album.<br />6. Buckbeak's Flight<BR>This is &quot;Flying&quot; from E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial all over again. It's almost as if Williams has gone back to one score for inspiration for each individual track, but luckily for us this is one that works above all others. THE BEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM.<br />7. A Window to the Past<BR>This ode-to-Renaissance-chamber-music cue grows on you the more you listen to it, due to the lopsided phrasing of the beautiful minor-key recorder melody (based on the original Hedwig's Theme), but it soon falls into place, with a 3-against-2 harpsichord accompaniment. As you appreciate the well-done &quot;Across the Stars&quot;-esque Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones mood and instrumentation, you'll have a hard time deciding whether track 6 or 7 is your favourite. The clarinet reprise, and mellow horn call are lovely, subtle musical treats.<br />8. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight<BR>The bombastic timpani return from track 6 and combine with a dramatic tutti, again hinting at previous Harry Potter themes (mainly Hedwig's) with style. The &quot;Snowball Fight&quot; portion softens the Quidditch-esque violence with pleasant but forgettable Christmassy orchestration. Quite reminiscent of The Sorceror's Stone's &quot;Entering the Great Hall.&quot;<br />9. Secrets of the Castle<BR>By now quite familiar with the new &quot;Double Trouble&quot; theme, Williams gives it the celeste flavour of the original Hedwig's Theme. A virtuosic flute jumps in, after a brief climax, to show off how far Williams can stretch his obviously-beloved Hedwig's Theme.<br />10. The Portrait Gallery<BR>&quot;Double Trouble&quot; is the subject of orchestral ridicule, the Medieval instrumentation this time adopting a very comedic character, despite its dark &quot;The Face of Voldemort&quot; undertones that surface more frighteningly towards this cue's conclusion.<br />11. Hagrid the Professor<BR>I have no idea what instrument this is (some sort of traditional English horn?), but it's definitely meant to poke fun at Hagrid in his out-of-character role. Williams continues to display his virtuosity at adapting a new theme over and over in many new contexts.<br />12. Monster Books and Boggarts!<BR>This is perhaps a sequel to the &quot;Apparition on the Train&quot; cue, but is all the more urgent this time. It should bring back intensely horrific memories ofthe Temple of Doom's &quot;Well of the Souls&quot; for any fan of that score. And yes, you guessed it, the &quot;Double Trouble&quot; theme is once again adapted to suit.<br />13. Quidditch, Third Year!<BR>What did you expect? No Quidditch track? Get lost! Williams transfers the energetic style from those of the first two films (if not maintaining the same rhythmic motives) to match his new set of themes and chords. The &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; motive as well as the &quot;Secrets of the Castle&quot; flute melody and of course, Hedwig's Theme, can be picked out, although not easily. The final two chords hint at the upcoming &quot;Saving Buckbeak&quot; cue.<br />14. Lupin's Transformation and Chasing Scabbers<BR>Yes, it's about time we slowed the pace down a bit. Only a bit. Williams soon injects even more timpani-based &quot;Quidditch&quot; drama, and an amusing pizzicato take on, yes, you guessed it, the &quot;Double Trouble&quot; theme.<br />15. The Patronus Light<BR>A beautiful adult choir hums us the Patronus story, much like something from Jurassic Park or Saving Private Ryan. Unfortunately, as the scene probably dictates, it is way too short.<br />16. The Werewolf Scene<BR>This is the perfect culmination of all the bombast and horror found in cues from the past three scores, particularly &quot;The Chess Game&quot; and obviously all things &quot;Quidditch.&quot; No guesses as to which themes are subtly reutilised, although Voldemort's theme from &quot;The Face of Voldemort&quot; appears for the first time, and more evidently, here.<br />17. Saving Buckbeak, and 18. Forward to Time Past<BR>Hedwig's Theme (and arguably Voldemort's too) is so subtly hinted here, it's amazing. We're treated to the most interesting funeral-esque march I've heard in a long time, cleverly using the &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; motive in its final metamorphosis, and what a crescendo! Meandering underscore over vibraphones leads us into &quot;Forward toTime Past,&quot; a cue that, really, speaks for itself, in a curious &quot;Face of Voldemort&quot; style.<br />19. The Dementors Converge, and 20. Finale<BR>More haunting dementors/&quot;Apparition on the Train&quot; underscore, with the addition of adult choir. The beauty and majesty of &quot;A Window to the Past&quot; on horns are assaulted by the dementors' music, then calmed by the choral &quot;Patronus Light&quot; theme, then given its original accompaniment, a fitting conclusion.<br />21. Mischief Managed!<BR>A credits suite that has 0% new music. Clever title, though!
B00005JMFQ|1.0|So..............the British now make films as badly as the Americans.  I have not been this disappointed with a major studio release in years.  The director took far too many characters, watered down their storylines so they had about 10 minutes screen time each, accompanied them with music of the heartstrings, and attempted to wrap it up nicely with a Christmas wreath.<br />What an embarrassing waste of talent.  The only bright spot in this film is the marvelous talent of Emma Thompson.  Her crying scene, accompanied by Joni Mitchell, makes you want her to make more films!  The wonderful Laura Linney, Liam Neeson and Colin Firth are all under utilized in this sad hodgepodge.  Please do not read the other reviews that promise you a wonderful holiday movie.  I am as sentimental as the next guy but you knew where this film was going in the first ten minutes.  And even then, characters were never allowed to resolve any of their dilemmas.<br />What drivel! Bah Humbug

B0000DAOHN|5.0|Janet Evanovich is able to keep me Laughing Out Loud with her Stephanie Plum books. Hard Eight was no exception.<br />              It all starts when Mabel calls asking for help in finding her granddaughter and great granddaughter. This happens to be a child custody bond, a kind that Vinnie isn't into yet, so if Stephanie does this, it'll be out of the goodness of her heart:) She does!<br />              Of the people she meets, which include a bunny and<BR>Bill Clinton, is a lawyer who she gets a job from, for her sister. All her sister wants is someone to marry. They do start dating. Like always, our little lady gets the job done but, IMO,<BR>she could never get the job done without good old Ranger and <BR>Morelli.<br />               I love Stephanie Plum and these books. Again I<BR>recommend this,like all Stephanie Plum books. This reviewer gives Hard Eight a rock hard five:)
B00028HBKM|5.0|\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" tells the familiar story of Jesus (Jim Caviezel) being captured by the Roman guard as he prays with his disciples in the garden at Gethsemane. Christ is then turned over to Pontius Pilate before ultimately being handed over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.<br /><br />Mel Gibson's screenplay does a good job of sticking to the original story of the crucifixion as laid out by the Gospels.  He also deserves commendation for refusing to shy away from the torture of Christ that most other filmmakers have stayed away from when tackling this subject.  However, the elements of blood and gore steal the focus from the core message that the film attempts to deliver.<br />The violence of the film is what most people come away talking about after seeing it, which is understandable since the film is almost entirely about violence.  The majority of the film focuses on the gruesome torture of Jesus, but it would not be fair to classify \\"The Passion\\" as the most violent film ever made.  War movies such as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and even Gibson's Oscar winning epic \\"Braveheart\\" are just two of the many films that strike me as being much more violent than this film.<br /><br />However, if you do not possess a Christian understanding of the true \\"passion\\" of the Christ that Gibson is trying to depict, then you will likely come away from the theatre focused on nothing but the carnage.<br /><br />\\"The Passion\\" is a story of unconditional love and sacrifice.  It purposely focuses on Jesus' torture and death in order to reflect Gibson's personal beliefs that Christ was indeed the Messiah who gave up his own life in order to offer the rest of humankind eternal salvation.  And unless you are aware of that message, this film will be nothing to you except a story about a man who is severely beaten and then executed.<br /><br />Many critics of the film have claimed that it promotes anti-Semitism, and this debate has been responsible for much of the attention that \\"The Passion\\" sparked even months before its opening.  However, Gibson has not in any way set out to promote anti-Semitism, and his film does no such thing.  The movie accurately depicts the villains of the story, who are made up of a group of Jewish politicians, some sadistic Roman soldiers, and a selfish governor who willingly condemns an innocent man to death in order to serve his own political interests.<br /><br />There are many excellent performances in this film, notably Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern as Mary and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene.  However, Hristo Shopov steals the show as Pontius Pilate, who is forced to choose between his own beliefs and the pressures of his people in order to determine the fate of an innocent man.<br />Rosalinda Celentano's character is one of the major liberties that Gibson takes with the script.  She does a convincing job of playing Satan, but she appears at very random parts of the film and seems to detract from the rest of the scene instead of adding anything to it.  (The fact that Gibson decided that Satan should look like Peter Jackson's depiction of Gollum in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is also a bit distracting.)<br />Anyone who has a slight knowledge of Christian tradition will be moved by \\"The Passion.\\"  Those who do are not familiar with the story of the Gospels will be unable to grasp Gibson's message, and this film will be wasted on them.  Gibson has done an amazing job of transcending the story of Christ's ultimate sacrifice to the screen.  \\"The Passion\\" is the most accurate depiction of that story that has ever been made, and it should be admired for that, although it will ultimately have different impacts for people of different backgrounds.<br />NOTE:  This film has an R rating, which I deem as appropriate.  There are many people clamoring about how \\"The Passion\\" should have been given a rating of NC-17 and that children have no business seeing this film.  Although I think that parents should take their child's individual needs into consideration before allowing them to see any movie, I witnessed many young children in attendance with their parents at the theatre, and they appeared to handle the movie without a problem.  Children who have been raised in a Christian environment will be familiar with the story of Christ's execution already, and parents may feel that the film is an excellent way to reinforce the story of Jesus' sacrifice.al needs into consideration before allowing them to see any movie, I witnessed many young children in attendance with their parents at the theatre, and they appeared to handle the movie without a problem.

B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban is going to be big.   Very big.   His voice is pure, natural, and with a range and power not to be dismissed as any take off of anyone else.   He has expression and passion that far exceeds most seasoned singers.   This is a beautiful album.  As far as singing in other languages goes....who cares....its the voice and the music.   Overproduced?   Only to immature listeners who have been spoon fed bad music for so long they don't recognize excellance when they hear it.   Groban brings beauty back.
B0001HAISG|4.0|I'm sorry I missed this in the theater. This film is so much better than most of the stuff that's out there. The thing is I loved it and will have to have the DVD for my collection.
B0001US8FI|5.0|This new release is quite a good treat, especially for Bruce Lee newly fans as it contains &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; movie (1973), &quot;A Warrior's Journey&quot; documentay (2001) &amp; &quot;Curse of the Dragon&quot; documentary (1993) all in one 2-discs special edition.<br />Additionally, it also contains the &quot;Bruce Lee - In his own words&quot; documentary (1998), Linda Lee interview, loads of trailers &amp; TV spots...<br />For an old fan like myself, the only special thing in this 2-discs special edition is the &quot;Blood &amp; Steel - The making of Enter the Dragon&quot; documentary. Pity that it was only about 30 mins. It contains new unreleased footage captured in Ahna Capri's video-cam back in 1973. Some glimpse of Bruce in the footage, one with Bruce lifting one leg &amp; spinning around (wonder what he was doing?). Some other scenes showing Bruce smiling (Charisma on-screen &amp; off-screen, tell me about it! Bruce is just so unique &amp; captivating). Another showing Bruce put a coat over Ahna Capri (wonder what he was doing!! lol)<br />I am also glad to see &quot;Curse of the Dragon&quot; documentary included in this DVD boxset. In my memory, I do not remember this documentary being released in DVD by Warner.<br />One disappointing side though, the Game of Death lost footage in &quot;A Warrior's Journey&quot; documentary appears frail in DVD quality as compared to the HK Legends' release of the &quot;Game of Death - Platinum Edition&quot; version. I would recommed any Bruce Lee fan to also get the latter because of the high DVD quality &amp; other special features. Furthermore, these 2 versions showcasing the lost footage fight scenes vary a little, with Bruce appearing a bit more in one version &amp; less in the other version &amp; vice versa.<br />Being a fanatic Bruce Lee fan, I have in fact already owned the 25th anniversary edition &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; DVD, &quot;A Warrior's Journey&quot; DVD, &amp; &quot;Curse of the Dragon&quot;VCD. So unless you are an average Bruce Lee fan, be prepared to part with some money.<br />To all Bruce Lee newly fans, I say to you what Bruce said to Karrem in the Game of Death lost footage: &quot;What you are waiting for??!!&quot;<br />All in all, I would give it a 5 stars rating for a nice collection in a 2-dics special edition.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have been waiting for &quot;Under My Skin&quot; since I had &quot;Let Go&quot;, and now taht I have it in my hands I can tell you that IT'S AN AMAZING ALBUM!!! I just can't stop listen to it, and it become one of my favourites albums for the first time I listened to it! Once again Avril shows her beautiful voice in every song, that, of course, she wrote. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; has awesome and touching lyrics, an amazing sense of melody, and a lot of potencial hits! If you are and Avril fan or not, you must buy it or at least listen to it - I bet you don't be dissapointent!<br />1. Take Me Away (4.5/5): It's like &quot;Losing Grip&quot; but even mature and serious... It has a wonderful energy and it's a good start.<br />2. Together (5/5): Pure feeling, Avril's voice sounds amazing and the lyrics are really touching.<br />3. Don't Tell Me (5/5): I really listen to this song 1.000.000 times but I keep loving it!!!<br />4. He Wasn't (3.5/5): A lot of energy showing her punky side... But I don't like this song really...<br />5. How Does It Feel (4/5): The slower song in the album. It's like Mobile Part II. Not her best song but she sings it very well.<br />6. My Happy Ending (5/5): Awesome, energetic, powerful, great song! It's one of my favourites songs of the album. This track will be the second single.<br />7. Nobody's Home (5/5): Ben Moody's colaboration, it talks about a girl wiht a lot of problems that she can't find her place... Very special and cool performance from Avril. This could be a potential third single.<br />8. Forgotten (3.5/5): I'm not into this song but it's ok...<br />9. Who Knows (5/5): A very positive song that sounds kinda rock/pop.<br />10. Fall To Pieces (10/5): My favourite!!! I love this song, the lyrics, the sound, everything!!! Avril Rocks!!!<br />11. Freak Out (4.5/5): Punkie song, written by Avril and her boys... It's a kind of song from Simple Plan or Good Charlote.<br />12. Slipped Away (4/5): Very sweet and touching, think that shededicated this song to her dead grandpather.
B00008YZYM|5.0|When this film was originally released in theatres, I had no desire to see it because I didn't think it could possibly live up to the Hayley Mills version.  Years later, I was flipping channels and saw it featured as the Disney movie of the week, and I fell in love with it!  This version is even BETTER than the original!  So much of the plot mimics the original story (twin girls separated at birth reunite and scheme to get their parents back together), and the small deviations are wonderful, like having one of the twins speak with a British accent (so cute!).<br />Lindsay Lohan is absolutely adorable in her dual role: I don't think I've ever seen a little girl as charming as she is!  Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are a wonderful couple, and Elaine Hendrix is perfect as the girls' evil stepmother-to-be.  Fans of the original \\"Partent Trap\\" will enjoy seeing Joanna Barnes in her cameo role as Meredith's mother, Vicki: a great tribute to the character she played in the 1961 version of the film).<br />The music in this film is fantastic, and I highly suggest that you purchase the soundtrack in addition to the DVD.  However, the one disappointment in this film is that the twin Lindsays don't do a modernized version of \\"Let's Get Together,\\" which is the song that the twin Hayleys performed for their parents in the original film.  in fact, there's no real musical number in this version at all (although they do briefly pay tribute to the classic song).<br />Overall, though, this movie is FABULOUS: I'm still kicking myself for not having gone to see it in the theatre, but I'm thrilled to own the DVD!
0679721037|2.0|This book - Hiroshima - is yet another book about the disastrous events which occurred in August of 1945 in Japan when the United States' atomic bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Only one aspect makes this book unique: the point of view. Focusing on a third person point of view, the author tells the many survivors' stories from a bystander-like perspective. Other than that, it's the same as everything else, but that I truly enjoyed.<BR>     Overall, the book is alright; hell, who am I kidding? The book is horrible. It starts out fairly dull, but then becomes moderately exciting as you read into it. Towards the last quarter of the book, it sucks to put it kindly. It's like somebody is slowly driving a railroad spike through my cranium from 11:15 A.M. - 12:40 A.M. every other day, as I watch the seconds hand on the clock slowly creep past the six, hoping that it will reach the seven, then the eight, and maybe if I am lucky, the nine. When in fact, the clock finally reaches 12:40 and I hear the bell ring for my next class, it's like the angels of heaven are peeing liquid gold into my ears. So, do yourself a favor (a big favor), and don't buy this book.
B00000JLWW|1.0|While this movie will never replace &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot; or &quot;Plan Nine From Outer Space&quot; as the worst Hollywood<BR>movie of all times, it certainly ranks as one of the most BORING.<br />Director James Cameron's target audience is obviously 11-16 year old American girls.  If you have anything more sophisticated than they do going on in your head, there is not much for you here besides dazzling special effects.  I say this because the love story which forms the sole raison d'etre for this movie is as hackneyed and cliched as can be.  Hollywood has done variations on this theme of &quot;doomed love&quot; dozens of times throughout the 30's, 40's and 50's, and done it better.  Everything about this movie, the size of the cast, the special effects and wardrobe budgets, is HUGE, but, ultimately, empty.<BR>Cameron should have cut the size of his cast in half and invested the money in a better script.<br />There is only one fully-developed character in the whole film, and that is the character of Rose, played by Kate Winslett.  Rose is an anachronism, a 1990's American feminist in Edwardian<BR>times, trapped in an arranged engagement for money.  Anyone who<BR>has read their Henry James is familiar with this scenario.  They are also aware of the subtle and obvious differences in attitudes between the women actually in these circumstances at that time and the attitudes of Rose.  By making all the other characters in the drama, even Leo DiCaprio's Jack Dawson, two-dimensional at best, whatever conflict that could develop in the plot lapses into a morass of cliches that you've seen a dozen or more times before.  When the self-centered fiance and his evil, toady butler meet their fates, your reaction is not: &quot;Good!&quot; but<BR>&quot;So what?!&quot;<br />The problem with a one character-driven plotline, is that the audience doesn't care one way or the other about any of the other characters, so what happens to them is unimportant.  If youfind the central character to be totally implausible or ridiculous, there's nothing to hold your interest in the story.  This flaw is compounded by the fact that we know in the first 10 minutes of the movie that Rose survives the Titanic and Jack does not.  Therefore, the only real suspense generated by the film is: &quot;When will it be over?&quot;<br />Just as annoying is the way Cameron treats all the really interesting themes which could have made this story interesting,<BR>the arrogance of wealth, the hubris of technology, the corruption and greed of vain ambition, as mere peripheral ornaments.  Everytime Cameron's camera finds something of interest to focus on, it cuts away.  &quot;Okay, we've shown you that,<BR>now back to our love story!&quot;  The conflicts between White Star Line heir Ismay and Captain Smith, which could have formed an<BR>interesting secondary plot, are given 10 minutes of cursory,<BR>obligatory attention, like mere factoids.  &quot;Oh yeah.  This was going on, too.&quot;<br />See the 1953 version with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.  It's got a love story, too.  It also has 3-dimensional characters you can care about and a storyline which involves you!
B00005JMEW|3.0|I just wish that reviewers would be accurate with their facts.  The Bride is codenamed &quot;Black Mamba&quot; (with an &quot;A&quot;) which is a species of fast and highly poisonous African snake (it can travel up to 12mph and 2 drops of its venom can kill a human in an hour) and which makes sense since she's supposed to be an assassin along with the rest of them.  The &quot;mambo&quot; is a Latin dance step which is definitely *NOT* her codename.  Jeez.<br />While the movie is somewhat gory, the most jarring part is the flipflop from human actors to cheesy cartoon (describing O-Ren Ishii's history) and then back again--they could've used actors!!!  It's even worse than the constant flicking back and forth chronologically (at least the black and white footage helps us to figure out whether we're viewing something in the past or the present).  The best fight scene is the one between The Bride wielding a katana and Gogo Yubari using spiked ball and chain in my opinion.  Even the final fight scene between The Bride and O-Ren Ishiii is a bit of a letdown.
0783225792|5.0|There aren't words to describe how good this movie is. It is a classic and not to be missed. Great mob movie. Joe Pesci does a superb job in this film, along with Robert Deniro and Sharon Stone.... Go Buy this NOW....
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is the best of the three &quot;Harry Potter&quot; soundtracks so far, in my opinion.  The music is a lot darker than it was for the first two films, and that was to be expected since &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is definitely a much spookier book.  My favorite track is definitely the &quot;Double Trouble&quot; song, which seems much more brooding on the CD than it was in the movie trailer, but I like it better this way.  I cannot wait to see this movie, and the CD is doing a good job of tiding me over until it opens!
B00008EY9G|5.0|A solid cast stars in this suspenseful whodonit that pretty much keeps you guessing to the end.  The logic remains true throughout - a big plus for me because I hate it when movies aren't even true to their own logic.  The movie sucks you in from the start - you need to pay attention from the very first frame on - and doesn't let up as we find ten people stuck in an out-of-the-way motel during a bad storm.  Then, as if there wasn't enough stuff going on, people start getting murdered.  It just keeps getting better.  I was surprised by seeming twists in the plot and reviewing found no major holes.  I rate it five stars because I certainly would recommend this film to friends (and have) and have added it to my personal library.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson REALLY hit it this time.  I usually hate christian movies because they're so cheezy, but this is no where near cheezy.  It's the best movie I've seen in a long time.  The music is beautiful and emotional, the cinematography is perfect, the acting is so real, and the experience is awe inspiring.  It really feels like you're actually right there.  I wanted to throw something at the guards a few times.  I have to admit, the first time I saw it it was very disturbing.  But if you haven't seen this, you should.  It will leave you speachless.  I think everyone(especially every christian) should have this in their library.  It is the most touching, most awesome movie I've ever seen.  So grab a box of tissues(even if you don't cry in movies, you might need the whole box) and enjoy.<br />But be warned, this is not a movie you want to show to young children.  Parents should deffinately watch this before deciding whether their children should or not.  It is extreemly graphic and brutal.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I don't understand why so many people are addicted to these types of movies. I wish people would really say what they really thought about this film just to stop impressing their friends and convincing people of how &quot;deep&quot; they are to understand a film like this. Even as one who enjoys abstract thought and film, I totally hated this movie. There wasn't a plot and it reminds me of those types of movies that those people who were just hurt in a relationship want to make to express their undying sadness and make their ex's seem like total uncaring arschlocher. I also don't understand why every premis to a movie or story has to be based on love. It's not a very intersting subject, and it's not that I can't relate, I just find it a boring subject. I would give this film two stars, because the colors and the the cinemetography weren't bad at all, but someone else said it best first &quot;Good frames won't save bad paintings.&quot;
0689859368|5.0|This is a great book for people who have read and enjoyed A Series of Unfortunate Events. This is a story about three kids; Jared, Simon, and Mallory.

B00005MP58|5.0|I first learned about this marvelous BBC miniseries while listening to Helen Fielding's commentary on a &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; DVD.  Apparently, Fielding's Bridget Jones books were inspired by her admiration of the BBC &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; production.<br />This 5 1/2 hour version, whose script faithfully follows Austin's dialogue, is my favorite movie.  Though I have viewed it many times, I never fail to be captivated by the actors' performances.  Without exception, the talented actors are perfectly cast, particularly Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  They are wonderful together!  In my opinion, Colin Firth deserves special praise.  This excellent actor can say so much with a gesture, a change in facial expression, or merely by  a look in his eyes.<br />I have viewed both the VHS and DVD versions.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the quality of the DVD is not particularly good. It played reasonably well on my first inexpensive DVD player, but tends to &quot;jump&quot; occasionally on my newly purchased higher quality player.  I too, hope that a better DVD edition will be made.<br />If I could, I would award more than five stars to this &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; production.  It is a masterpiece!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Let me admit that I took film classes in college and that I usually prefer non-mainstream, independent or foreign films (that includes ones from Great Britain).  I think I get the whole title thing, I really do.  I mean it's based on the director's experience - about feeling lost in a totally foreign culture.  There were flashes of greatness (Bill Murray's wife Fed-Exing decorating decisions, the whole has-been actor scenes, etc.) and the feeling of isolation was beautifully done (the young wife feeling alone even when with her husband, phone conversations were compelling, and so on) but it's just like that story you and your friends tell and laugh hysterically about but either you REALLY had to be there to find it funny or you have to be ______(drunk, sleep deprived or you fill in the blank here) to understand.  I mean, these are things you only retell in certain personal circles so what made the director think a general audience would appreciate this piece of work?  Maybe it's pure genuis and just like her characters who don't \\"get\\" what's going on around them - the viewer isn't meant to like it either.  In that case, this film is too student-art-house for me and even if it is as brillant as most declare.......put me down for an emphatic \\"NO\\".  Sophie Coppola scored high with me for her previous film \\"Virgin Suicides\\" but maybe that was because her style of deliberate unclarity fit that particular story which was based on a great novel by the same name.  For some reason, this attempt got much more acclaim.

B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day Dookie(1994) Their Third Album<br />In the early 90's Green Day was a little known indie band from california. They released Two albums before this that got attention from major record labels. They signed with Reprise Records and released Dookie in 1994. The album starts out with Burnout. This is a song that has been highly overlooked. The next song is Having a blast which is about suicide bombing. The third song is chump which        contains an awesome drumb solo. The fourth song is longview which is one of the finest songs on the album. Welcome to paradise is another great song by Green Day. The sixth song is pulling teeth which is about an abusive girlfriend. Basket Case is about being crazy and is one of the best songs on the album. She is another great song. Sassafras Roots which is about wasting your time has a great bass and is one of y favorites. When I Come Around is my favorite song on the album and has an awesome guitar riff. Coming Clean, Emenius Sleepus, and F.O.D. and not that great and are throw aways in my opinion.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Hopefully, that caption didn't scare you off.  This movie provided pure escapism that didn't annoy the viewer with illogical twists or a plot that unravels.  I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I might.  It was a surprisingly good adventure story that remained solid to the ending credits.  Yeah, you rooted for the good guys (or is that criminals?) all the way through the film but aren't you suppose to in this genre, if it's done right?  This movie was done more than right - it was done with a well written script, snappy dialogue, fast paced plot, interesting characters and great acting.  Ohhh, the cars didn't hurt either - made me want to run out and get a mini cooper until I remembered they were made by BMW not to mention having two kids....ahhhh the magic of a good film.

B0001NBMBC|2.0|There are some metal bands, such as Nothingface, who have managed to evolve and still keep their underlying heaviness intact.  You know that if you go to one of their concerts, you will not be disappointed.  Slipknot should have remained in that category, since they are one of the best live acts around, beating the crap out of each other and their instruments while playing Heavy as heck music from one of their first two albums.  I felt like their sound needed to evolve some from their first two albums, but this is not what I had in mind.  For the most part this album is pretty lame.  They sound way too &quot;radio friendly&quot;, and none of the songs really jump out and grab you.  Other reviewers have compared them to Stone Sour, which I cannot do since I have never heard their music.  But SS must suck if Vol 3 is what they sound like.  I cannot imagine Slipknot being great live anymore, if they are going to play songs like &quot;Circle&quot; or &quot;Vermillion&quot; live.  What are they going to do?  Stand around like a bunch of morons singing the various harmonious parts of the songs?  That isn't what you go see them live for.  Well, Slipknot had a good run of two great albums in a row, and now this piece of garbage.  I said evolution, not de-evolution!
0783225881|5.0|Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. You dont expect the ending and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. You think the whole while that he is doing everything for Shoeless Joe only to realize at the end that he was doing everything to get reunited with his father. If the ending of this movie doesn't bring a tear to your eye then you are missing the whole point of this movie. Dreams Can Come True
0385510438|1.0|I think John Grisham usually writes excellent legal thrillers, but this one was horrible.  He seemed to be very wordy without having a point.  He dragged things on, the conclusion was poor and unfullfilling for all the time put into reading the plot.  The characters were likable, but just did not seem to go anywhere.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I received this DVD as a Christmas present and let me tell you, it is excellent. There are so many videos that Whitney has made over the years as an artist. And when you first view the DVD, there's a short intro made by Whitney herself, as well as a fun and interactive menu of what you want to watch. I enjoyed the interviews of Whitney and Clive Davis. One thing that made me laugh is seeing all of her old videos that she made in the 80's. It's amazing to see how much the style of pop music has changed. To sum up, this DVD is rich with Whitney material that won't put you down at all.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Songs in the Key of Life is supreme. He really outdid himself on this one, with songs like Village Ghetto Land, I Wish, Sir Duke, and one of my personal favorites not released as a single, Joy Inside my Tears, this man cemented his position as one of the great musical genius of our time. I really can't put into words how good Stevie's music makes me feel. I listen to him when I need a pick-me-up or just want to jam or feel good. This album though, deserves it's title because it does cover every aspect of life, the black experience and for everyone. I think the song Ngiculela is fantastic. His vocals as usual are so clear and towards the end when he carries his voice saying &quot;I am singingggggggggggggggg........&quot; gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. So emotionally intense and open. He's fabulous. Socially conscious, deep and personal. SITKOL is his greatest work.

B0001UL7RY|3.0|i think this cd is ok....so far i have listened to it a couple times and its not great. but its also not bad, i recomend u buy it.
B00008G9JN|3.0|This is the first and only Jethro Tull CD I've ever owned. I'm not a huge fan, but I did enjoy the songs on this CD. I like the harmony in singing, and the use of different musical instruments that you wouldn't find in your typical rock band. I just found the sound quality of the tracks not as good as they can be. It's as if the lead singer recorded all the songs in an empty studio and you can almost hear his voice echo. Otherwise, good CD.
B0000669JL|5.0|Well, I've always known that Bob Marley was at one point and still is to a lot of people all over the world, a huge influential icon. His messages in his music touch us all because he talked about such deeply meaningful issues affecting all of humanity. The fact that it's reggae and has that unmistakable reggae sound, it became popular because it was so hard not to notice and appreciate it. Previously I had not known of any of his music being 25 and pretty much into R &amp; B, and Hip Hop but wow, this CD really introduced me to him and made me a fan. I plan on purchasing more of his music. See, that's the best part of &quot;Best Of&quot; albums they can peak your interest and make you want the whole that the artists have to offer.
0156027321|3.0|I believe reviews stretching a bit to say that this is some sort of quest for God.  I purchased this book partially based on that hype.  I may not have been so dissapointed if the concept of spirituality had been omitted in reviews and summaries.  Apart from a short stint in the beginning, in which the main character tried to become a member of multiple religions (not for any great reasons), this book has little to do with spirituality, in the usual sense.  <br />This is an adventure story.  Some interesting things are learned about animal behavior.  If the reader does not mind a great deal of brutal gore(sort of an antithesis of spirituality, in my opinion), then it can be very entertaining.<br />I found it a quick, easy, read; and would recommend it to those who enjoy adventures.  I would not recommend it for those on any sort os spiritual quest.
0345410025|5.0|Thank you Harry that you changed my life.<BR>I remember when few years ago I have read this book translated to my original language. Now after few years of research I am Memory Development Specialist teaching others how to memorize...<br />I remember when I was young and memorizing new words from English was soo difficult and time consuming. When I applied Harrys systems (which are ancient to be truth) my life has changed for much easier, safer and better.<BR>I am an actor, and also I was the only Polish Ventriloquist...<BR>It is nightmare to forget your lines on the stage! But now I can remember them forwards and backwards and recall as easy as ABC.<br />Harry is a good teacher.

B00000269G|5.0|I recently bought this album so that I, Karl Marx (K.M), Che Guevara, and little Joe (Joe Stalin)would have it for our weekly poker game. <br />Unfortunately, after hearing track 6 &quot;Red Top&quot; Bugsy Segal's apparition decided to enter the room and demand protection money. He almost ruined our game until he heard that we had &quot;Concert by The Sea&quot; playing in the backround. <br />I mean who knew Benny (Bugsy Segal a known psychopath/assassin) was a fan of Erroll Garner!! <br />Here's why our dead proletariat's society liked it:<br />Mr. Garner's piano playing (despite having imperfect sound quality) is as close to pure perfection as is humanly possible. To quote my friend K.M (Karl Marx) &quot;vow vhat a greate album!&quot;<br />Each song is pure poetry for the ears and mind. &quot;Concert by the Sea&quot; justly deserves a place of honor in every serious/not so serious jazz collection.<BR> <BR>In conclusion, it deserves two fists up. A great christmas/father's day gift for capitalist or communist in your family.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Watching the Today show this morning I honestly wasn't expecting too much when they announced the newest &quot;singing sensation&quot; up next. I mean, how many of these sensations do we have now with all the prime-time talent shows on the air? Then, Renee Olstead was introduced and pulled off a flawless, note-bending, magically moving rendition of &quot;Summertime&quot; backed by a top-notch big-band combo. <br />I must say, I was more than impressed. I listened to the whole album on her website and will be getting the CD soon. 14 or not, Renee Olstead is a undeniable joy to listen to and watch. Although she's just starting out, she's a good six or seven times better than any American Idol or Star Search contestant I've heard and, needless to say, she has more stage presense in her little finger than all of those so-called Idols put together.<br />Renee can sing dramatically well for her age, blessed as she is with great timbre and bold technique. In most of her songs there's a knowing, haunting quality to her tone to complement the occasional brashness of her delivery. You get the feeling she could outright own the jazz/pop scene in a few years if she widens her repertory just enough while continuing to develop her world-class vocal gift.
B000002G87|4.0|Forget &quot;Layla.&quot; Turn this baby to track 9, &quot;Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?&quot;       Even if every one of your experiences with love has been happy, you will be crying to the darker side by the time this song has spun its duration into your brain. You will feel uncontrollably driven to partake in typical heartbreak behavior like alcoholism without really knowing why...and you will fleetingly contemplate never loving another again, even after listening to &quot;Love Is A Wonderful Thing&quot; on repeat and watching every notable American romantic comedy available on DVD to dissuade yourself against better judgement.       Additionally, even if you're an atheist or agnostic or a godless heathen, you will seriously consider the guitar solos on this song to have been sparked from some otherworldly spiritual force...or perhaps from a sadness that only permeates the darkest depths of human desperation..you decide.      And if you have no soul, this is just a good rock n roll album...possibly, a soundtrack for cleaning your bathroom. But you need to ignore the fact that the music and lyrics are stained with heartache and that it might spill over onto your tiles if you make the mistake of letting it creep into your psyche.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I expected this to be more like her first album. This has fallen flat in my opinion and hope her third cd is better.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes have done it again. Great rock albums will continue from the White Stripes. They are awesome.
B00008RV1L|3.0|This is a pretty good movie.  Christian Bale is great, and there are some very funny moments.  The director Mary Herron deserves credit for salvaging something out of Brett Easton Ellis's vomit-inducing novel.<BR>That is my real goal for posting this review:  warning viewers to steer far clear of the book.  Trust me, I am doing a valuable public service.  You may be curious about the book because you liked the movie, but STAY AWAY!  The book is a big, heaping, stinking pile of trash.  If you thought the movie was voilent, you ain't seen nothing yet.  Unlike the movie, the &quot;satire&quot; of the book gets utterly lost within scene after scene of depravity.  You have been warned.  Flipping through this book is like peeking into Ellis's toilet several hours after he ate a very large meal.  You might find some pages of his book floating in there too, because that's all it's good for.
B000000H5J|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite cds, even though it took me a few years to appreciate how great it really is. It is great all the way through, but certain songs stick out for me like pisschrist and demanufacture. I think pisschrist is the best on the album, with the brilliant and catchy main riff, awsome industrial samples, and a great combination of heavy vocals at the start and melodic vocals at the end. Increadibly catchy, this is my favourite FF song by far. H/K is probably one of the heaviest songs on the album, along with Flashpoint or New Breed. Demanufacture is a great way to start off the album, starting kind of low then building it up in a matter of seconds to full out distortion with a powerful attack, classic FF style. Self Bias Resistor has an awsome groove overall and a very catchy chorus. Zero Signal has more keyboards and melodic singing in it than normal FF, but still ends up doing an awsome job at it. Body Hammer and Replica are average tracks, which is still saying a lot considering this entire album is awsome. The digipack also has a cover of Agnostic Front's Your Mistake and Resistancia!, along with remixes of New Breed and Replica. My favourite of the bonus tracks is Resistancia! because it is really heavy and catchy. Another cover that appears on this CD is Head of David's Dog Day Sunrise, which also doesn't seem like typical FF but still fits in with the album. A Therapy for Pain ends the normal (not digipack) album the way FF will for the rest of their CDs - melodic yet powerful and very catchy.<br />This is fear factory's best album by far in my opinion, and is worth your money.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Kurt Wimmer's stark, violent cautionary tale is set after WWIII.  Citizens are being controlled by a drug which stifles their emotions.  The government feels that without emotions, there will be no wars, no murders; they think emotions are a handicap, and they use clerics to uphold the law.  Anyone showing emotion is either killed on the spot or incinerated later.  No trials, nothing.  Of course, this means all things like literature, music, etc., are banned.<br />Christian Bale stars as the highest ranking &quot;Cleric&quot;, who enforces the law dictated by Father (Sean Pertwee).  Early in the film, Bale's partner (Sean Bean) shows evidence of having feelings, and when Bales finds him reading the poetry of Yeats, he is forced to kill him.<br />His new partner (an appropriately sniveling Taye Diggs) is excited to work with Bales, but at the same time he is more in mind.  Angus McFayden plays the chief of council, whose agenda is also more than meets the eye.<br />Bales finally decides to stop taking the daily drug doseages and is rewarded with feelings----and a threat to his life and career.<br />The battle sequences are awesome in their fluidity and imagination.  Bales and Emily Watson as doomed Mary O'Brien, are particularly good, and the movie is quite original in its take of Fahrenheit 451.<br />Gloomy yet impressive.
B000148KK2|3.0|Taken from At Jims Place [...]<br />The Girl In The Other Room -<BR>Diana Krall<br />Track 6 is fantastic. Diana wanted a different sound.... she found it! The title of this track is &quot;Love Me Like A Man&quot;. It's kind of a jazzy, bluesy thing. Uptempo, hard driving and great. Diana's smoky voice is very well suited to the song and, best of all, her piano is back on track, big time. Side man Anthony Wilson is there with his electric guitar. Wilson is outstanding, as usual. Unfortunately, that's about it. <br />With this release, Krall leaves behind the great standards that helped propell her to enormous world wide success. Instead of standards, for this recording Krall drew material from several excellent contemporary writers. Tunes written by Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits, Mose Allison and her new hubby, Elvis Costello, are featured. Also present are 6 songs co-written by Krall &amp; Costello. It's not that the songs are bad, it's just that when compared with all of those great old standards we've come to associate with Krall, they pale dramatically. <br />The best thing about this recording is that Diana has returned to the piano. Ahhhh, the girl.... and her piano... in the other room.<br />My 10 point ratings are: Music, 6.5 of 10. Performance, 8 of 10. Recording, 9.5 of 10. Cautiously recommended.
0060958324|5.0|This book opens:<BR>And what is good, Phaedrus,<BR>And what is not good--<BR>Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?<br />If you are one of those that can keep your eyes open through this book then it will likely touch your mind and your life for years to come.  <br />I first read this work as a high school student in an AP English class where we studied it, discussed it, disected it and taught it to one another. This book taught me how to think.  And it taught me I can understand anything if it's written clearly enough and if I'm willing to put some thought into it.<br />Everything in this book interconnects...the characters involved, the setting, the philosophy--decoding the connections (such as wind and heights to phaedrus' appearance) is half the fun.   <br />Reading it again after 15 years I find that some of my basic assumptions about the world and life stem from this book.  I remember some of Pirsig's babies such as &quot;stuckness&quot; and &quot;gumption&quot; and they are thoughts I've loved to play with over the years.  Other ideas--such as the split between eastern and western cultures and various philosophers--have perhaps subtily played with ME through the years. I enjoyed discovering this during my latest re-read. <br />It is so worth the effort to read about Pirsig's views on mechanization, the front windshield being compared to a TV screen, teaching english and so many other things. If you like to think (and why wouldn't you?) you will love this book.<br />That being said,I do feel that Pirsig's logic is flawed. And I enjoyed every step of figuring out why I believe the way I do.  This book is a fascinating study into the personality of a proud intellectual grappling with subjectivity. <br />I say, read this book and think.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I heard Renee on the Today Show on Memorial Day and was WOWED!~!(The band is perfect, too). Her voice is soothing with a romantic kind of jazzy comfort that I can listen to for hours. I am listening to the whole album as I write this review and Midnight at the Oasis is bringing goosebumps to my arms. I just ordered the CD. Norah Jones has healthy competition with this 14 year old. When does the tour begin??
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|Michelangelo Antonioni's seminal 1966 film \\"Blow-Up\\" influenced the generation of filmmakers who came of age during the counter-culture era of the 1960s and 70s (Francis Coppola's \\"The Conversation\\" in particular).  While it hasn't exactly aged very well, its sheer dated-ness is part of its charm.<br />The late David Hemmings portrays a young, jaded, wealthy, misogynist fashion photographer who's life of nonstop sex, drugs, parties and beautiful women bores him to tears.  While snapping photographs of a couple locked in an embrace, he inadvertantly discovers that he may--or may not--have photographed a murder, and is pestered for the negatives by a mysterious woman (Vanessa Redgrave) who may know more than she lets on.<br />The film is set in the \\"Swinging\\" London of the 1960s, which comes off as surprisingly dull.  The buildings and the weather are grey and depressing, the drug parties are boring, and the audience at a Yardbirds concert (featuring Jeff Beck and a pre-Led Zep Jimmy Page) is practically catatonic.  I couldn't help but think of the \\"Austin Powers\\" movies while watching \\"Blow-Up\\", and how Hemmings seems like a sullen version of MI5's groovy special agent.<br />What titillated audiences in 1966 no doubt was the smoking of marijuana and the threesome featuring Hemmings and two young girls, complete with a brief shot of pubic hair.  That's probably why the film was such a hit back then.  The sex and drugs by today's standards are pretty tame, to be honest.  What shines through today is the storytelling, particularly the story of the alleged murder, told silently through a series of Hemmings' blow-up photographs.  <br />\\"Blow-Up\\" also has a metaphysical aspect to it, namely \\"What is reality?\\"  That subject is simply TOO complicated for one humble, unpaid Amazon reviewer.  While the slow pace and unconventional ending to \\"Blow-Up\\" will no doubt aggravate some viewers, it is certainly a film that has left a permanent mark on cinema today.
B000002MUW|4.0|Madonna's album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; was a much needed lift from the David Letterman show controversy she faced in 1994. I think this album made me completely forget about that for good.  It balanced well with the R&amp;B and hip-hop of TLC, Notorious B.I.G., Aaliyah, R. Kelly and others that year. Survival, Secret, Inside of Me, Sanctuary, Human Nature, Don't Stop and others were that good.  And how Santuary fades out and the dramatic Bedtime Stories begins just brings a stark mode to the album.  This album also has the beautiful Take a Bow, of which Babyface produced and sang background on.  I also liked the songs she did with the underrated Dave Hall, who also had several hits as a producer between 1994 and 1995. Madonna is so good at reinventing herself and doing something different each album.  This album is one of them and one of her best.
B00005UW7V|5.0|I am a little late writing this review, but as they say better late than never.  If you are a science fiction buff, you will enjoy it.  I loved it for the emotion and pure innocence.  Others have criticized it, but in my opinion it's worth the investment.  Watch it several times you will cry, each time! It grabbs you! I enjoyed every minute of it EXCEPT the \\"futuristic and a bit far fetched\\" prelude to the ending, here I expected more of the film.  I found that anti climatic.<br />ON THE OTHERHAND<br /><br />The acting by Haley Joel Osment was nothing short of outstanding, very emotional, beautiful and filled with true love.  It is quite beyond me why this actor has not received the praise and accolades of his peers.  This boy has performed so well (the sixth sense, and Pay it Forward) and others, each one better than the last.  Even at the Oscars when the sixth sense won everybody was shocked that Haley did not get his.  His acting in this was even better than Pay it Forward which I found excellent in both performance and concept.  What is wrong in Hollywood, don't they recognize real acting talent, what more do they want from this boy?<br />Buy it you'll see what I mean!
B00004Z459|5.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD AND # 2 IS DA BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE CD!!<BR>The songs are very satisfactory and cheer me up when im upset. i can just chill and listen to this cd
B0001AP12G|4.0|Ok, now if you know me by now (which I hope none of you weirdos do) then you know I'm usually harsh but fair when it comes to reviews. Now imagine you're on your bed trying to sleep from a bad hangover after drinking and feeling like a million trucks ran over your head, when your b***h of a sister plays some loud music. Except this music is actually good.<br />Naturally I would think I am dreaming but wow, I never thought I'd like a soul influenced album. Straight from the first track this album his hot like a my poo after eating chilli.<br />Let's break this down into tracks.<br />1. Intro - Wow, does Kanye do Stand Up? If so he better sit down. Stupid intro C.<BR>2. We Don't Dare  - Wooooo, some good lyrics, something I can relate to. A<BR>3. Graduation Day  - Like I said, he should sit down. C<BR>4. All Falls Down- Damn, the lyrics are absoloutely sick from start to end, and the chorus is something you wanna sing. then again if you don't have great voice like me then just mime it. A+<BR>5. I'll Fly Away - Flying on the vocal/gospel sound but damn sure wouldn't fly to #1 in the single charts. B- <BR>6. Spaceship      - I guess alot of us feel like this sometimes.... oh wait unless you're perfect like me... haha, seriously though a really beautiful track... like the opposite of Britney Spear's mug. A+<BR>7. Jesus Walks     - Wow, this is a song which we rarely see these days. Jesus walks peeps, and if you don't believe what he says in his lyrics then please stab yourself in the eye directly with a pencil (which is sharp) A* <BR>8. Never Let Me Down  - Now associating Jay Z with good lyrics is like associating Britney Spears with talent or Jermaine Duprei with good lyrics. But surprsingly JAY Z delivers some good flows and lyrics here. Same with Kanye West and the other artists. A-    <BR>9. Get Em High      - Oh damn, the flows are untouchable on this, like a Canadian with SARS. Kanye really shows his rap skills on this track, same with Talib Kweli and the others.A*<BR>10. Workout Plan- Stupid skit. Nothing pisses me off more than skits. Ok maybe George Bush but that's it. C      <BR>11. The New Workout Plan - Haha, incest, SARS, Luthor Vandross quotes. All in this track. Truly something you don't see every day. A*     <BR>12. Slow Jamz- I like this version better than the remix because  this gives more samples of the soul legends like the Isley Brothers etc. You still get to hear Twista's flows but not the extra you see on T.V. at the end. A*      <BR>13. Breathe in Breathe Out - LUDA!!! LUDA!!! Damn this track is off the hook. And I don't mean the coat hook. I've never heard a chorus so tight. Damn Kanye smacked it with this one. A**     <BR>14. School Spirit Skit 1  - WOW, ANOTHER STUPID SKIT. A bit funny though. B    <BR>15. School Spirit - In the immortal words of the programme \\"My Wife and Kids\\" AH....NAH! C      <BR>16. Lil Jimmy Skit - Haha, once again, just that bit funny. B     <BR>17. Two Words   - TWO WORDS. HOLY S*IT. I thought nothing could compare to Get Em' High, but this is another sick flowing track with Mos Def on. A**   <BR>18. Through the Wire- The first single off the album. WHen I first heard this tune I was like \\"Wow, this is some deep stuff \\" Then I heard his voice going over and over again and hearing stupid pricks at school saying his lyrics as well. Sigh.... would've got an A* but got played out. A+      <BR>19. Family Business - Deep deep deep.Another great soul song. The lyrics are as I said deeeeeeeeeeeep. A*     <BR>20. Last Call- Grrrr, sorry I tried to listen to all of this but then I fell asleep (...)having a dream about animal porn.... oops too much info there. Anyways Kanye tells us his life story about getting to the top for too long in my opinion. But still good... NOT. C<br />Overall if it wasn't for the stupid skits in the song I would've given it 5*... but hey, not all of us are intelligent.
B000002GBD|5.0|Opt for the import version with the 6 bonus tracks instead of this release.  A much better \\"bang for the buck\\" and the bonus tracks are pretty decent (compared to Judas Priest, Blue Oyster Cult, & Motorhead releases where the bonus tracks are virtually unlistenable).  But man, can ya get much better on a intro than the title track, \\"Hair Of The Dog\\"?  \\"The Dog\\" is a \\"bona fide\\" classic, right up there with Montrose's \\"Rock The Nation\\" for top hard rock intro of the 70's.<br />This album is a must have for any fan of 70's hard rock.  So if you ain't got it yet, add to cart.
0385335482|5.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" is Sophie Kinsella's first book of the Shopaholic trilogy. It reveals the main character, Rebecca Bloomwood, a financial journalist who cannot manage her own financial matters generously.<br />Working in a financial journal, \\"Successful Savings\\", is a career Rebecca never wanted to have. She would rather fancy herself working in popular magazines such as Marie-Claire, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, etc. She loves fashion and all the glamorous things but unfortunately she does not have enough money to afford her tastes.<BR>Most of all she is crazy about shopping and always making some excuses for what she has bought. Then she is trapped in debt troubles but ignores most of warning letters from the banks and again makes some lame excuse letters for delaying the payments. She tries either cutting back or making more money but nothing succeeds. Her love life problems make everything even worse. She feels that Luke Brandon, a successful handsome millionaire she has a crush on, makes fun of her. Desperately, she leaves all behind for a moment and runs to her parents' home. There she finds a financial case which has made her parents' neighbor lost a huge windfall because of listening to her wrong advice to switch their investment. Rebecca feels really bad about it but suddenly she has the idea to make a great article about it for she senses that the financial company might have cheated their investors. She gets a big attention and an offer to perform in a television show. From that moment her life begins to change and she also gets Luke, the millionaire, attracted to her. <br />The novel is hilarious and funny. Sophie Kinsella is able to create such a character who can be the reflection of some chicks for the girly things such as going for shop without any particular reasons, collecting the shopping bags just in case she needs them to show off, dreaming to have a prince charming, and many others. This book is worth to read if you are looking for an entertaining and amusing story.
B00005B4GU|4.0|If you like Radiohead you will appreciatte this CD. There are quite a number of good songs on this album. Pact like Sardines.., Pyramid Song, You and whose Army, Knives Out, and Like Spinning Plates. However, it is not another OK Computer or Kid A. It lacks the composition of the latter and the track sequence is confusing at times. It is deffinetly worth the money you will spend on it though, but not recommended for new listeners.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The title of this review is the key question to keep in mind  while reading the one-, two-, or even three-star reviews others have written.  The majestic cinematography, sparse, smart dialogue (not a word is wasted), and perfect performances by Johansson  and Murray, make this an essential movie for anyone with a tender heart.  Kudos to Ms. Coppola.  And to those who couldn't see, hear or feel what this movie was saying, you have my deepest sympathy.
B00006RCNW|1.0|The storyline sucks. The dialogue sucks etc....How can anyone watch this when there are good shows out there like 24, West Wing and the Sopranos. This show doesn't even come near...

0446530891|1.0|The perfect example of a writer whose success has gone to his head and who thinks he doesn't have to keep working at his craft.  This is not a thriller.  It is not a whodunit.  It's a mish-mosh.  And in order to keep the plot moving, he switches points of view to show us the villain's reactions.  But since it's a whodunit, he can't tell us who the villain is, and so calls him the &quot;Buick guy&quot;.  Please, please, don't waste your money buying this book.  If you have to read it, get it from the library.
B000021XR5|4.0|Stone Temple Pilots is a band that I had more or less forgotten about over the years, though hearing about No. 4 coming out when I'd thought they'd already gone the way of the dodo...<br />And I was amazed, still am as a matter of fact.  Core and Purple, the only other albums they've done that anyone pays attention to, were pretty straight-forward and both pretty much followed themes, where No.4 goes in all sorts of musical directions from track to track.  My favorite out of the bunch, and judging from the other things I've heard from them, likely the last one I'll buy.
B000002NBY|5.0|I've gone both ways with Simon.  Too often his efforts are at best sophomoric - &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; - and unworthy of his talent.  Then there are times - &quot;Paul Simon&quot; - when his reach equals his grasp  This is hardly the world music album his fans think it is, but it does, nonetheless, appropriate superbly, those things world music albums are supposed to have, namely a great R&amp;B band.  Not even Sun City scab Linda Ronstadt can dampen the moment.  A
0684857219|1.0|I'm just going to tell it like it is. I idolized Arnold while growing up and followed his training methods to the letter for 5 years but i got nowhere near my bodybuilding goals. First and foremeost Arnold is is terrifically gifted genetically for growing muscle and was further bolstered with the most powerful drugs at the time. He does not tell this to his readers. He would have grown no matter what training he did. He has no clue, abslutely no clue on how to train genetically typically people like myself, who can build an impressive physique if the proper training methods are followed. But you will not find these methods in this book. All you will find is routines of the 'champs' who like Arnold are light years away from regular people. There is no way these routines will work for you unless you have similar genetics, (and if you are reading this review then you most likely do not)and that you're ready to get into the mess of drug abuse. <BR>I regret having to give this book only one star cos it really is beautifully presented, but being a personal trainer i'm only going to judge a book on how much it will help a person reach his training goals.I have no vested interest whatsoever so please heed this advice.. If you want to add to your collection of training books please by this book. But if you're really interested in building a big, strong and healthy physique in minimum time please read Beyond Brawn by Stuart McRobert.
B00000255F|5.0|Springsteen is that rarest of characters.  He's scared but hopeful, indignant but steadfast.  How else to explain contradictions like &quot;maybe we ain't that young anymore&quot; with &quot;we gotta get out while we're young&quot; or &quot;you ain't a beauty but hey you're alright.&quot;  He can't reconcile these contradictions, but in the grand tradition of rock-n-roll that doesn't stop him from trying.  And it is the trying that we see the angst of his soul.  From the title track to &quot;Jungle Land&quot; the album reeks of a confused man in search of answers, who can't stand still long enough to find them.  Like most rebels with a cause, his mission is righteous.  Here's hoping when he solves the riddles he still has something significant to say.  A
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is by far the best slipknot album. Slipknot have usually gone with the hardcore approach its not all hard lots of melodic songs and heavy ones.<BR>Prelude 3.0-5/5 Best way to start a good album<BR>the bliste exists-4/5 least favorite song on their cd but damn good.<BR>Three nil-5/5 really good song.<BR>opium of the people-5/5 exellent song sounds a bit funny but o well.<BR>Duality- 5/5 DAMN good song i love the music videi to.<BR>Circle- 5/5 I never knew that Acoustic guitar could go with slipknot this well, They 've reached for the stars. The starts a bit cheezy but o well.<BR>welcome-4/5 o.k<BR>Vermillion-5/5 excellent<BR>pulse of the maggots-5/5 This cd is very underrated<BR>Before i forget-5/5 good song i like the chorus<BR>The nameless-4/5 good song<BR>vermillion pt2-5/5 Vermillion is better<BR>The virus of life- 4/5 eerie but good song.<BR>danger keep away- 4/5 meh
B0001NBMBC|4.0|WOW, this CD is damn cool and a real suprise. I liked the first album, it was a bit childish but for me thats what gave it its charm. Iowa was a big improvment, hitting hard with some super agressive tracks. And now, the 'knot has released this, throwing a large spanner in the works.<br />1. Prelude 3.0 (4/5) A strong start, very different.<BR>2. The Blister Exists (5/5) awesome heavy track, incredible percussion<BR>3. Three Nill (4/5) Another good head banger, love the chorus.<BR>4. Duality (5/5) I guess you would have heard this one, really catchy, great riffs.<BR>5. Opium of the People (10/5) I love this song, cool shredding at the start.<BR>6. Circle (1/5) This is half the reason this album gets 4 stars instead of 5, its not that I'm against accustic songs, this one just sucks. They should have put Dont Get Close on here instead.<BR>7. Welcome (4/5) arrrr thats better, good enough to beat yourself to a pulp to (if thats your thing)<BR>8. Vermilion (5/5) hated it at first, but it has grown on me.<BR>9. Pulse of the maggots (4/5) nice typical cheesy slipknot song.<BR>10. Before I forget (5/5) probably my fav song, awesome chorus.<BR>11. Vermilion pt2 (5/5) like i said, i'm not against accoustic songs, this is awesome.<BR>12. The nameless (5/5) Another fav, incredible and orriginal.<BR>13. The virus of Life (3/5) pretty cool, weird industrial song.<BR>14 Danger - Keep Away (0/5) The other half of the reason why this album dosent get 5 stars, should have closed it up on the virus of life me thinks.<br />So there you have it, thats my view ne ways. It's a good buy, and a huge improvment on ther previous efforts, i just hope this isnt the last we will hear from these nine guys.
0393324818|5.0|They used to call me &quot;Moneyballs&quot; in college so when I noticed this on the best seller list at the local independent, I got more than a little excited.  Alas, I was to be surprised by yet another book NOT about Heavy Hop Dop.  This is a book about my favorite sport!  Baseball.  And a good one too.  It reads fast and even amuses in places.  I'm not an A's fan (even if I did get all A's in school), but this &quot;Moneyball&quot; is an entertaining read.  Play balls!  HHD.
0618526412|3.0|Carson McCullers has written a beautiful book about the Depression Era with tragic yet deep rooted characters who pull at your heart strings.<br />Every character in this book is written with compassion and understanding. They all possess a desire for something and they are all led away from exactly what they desire because of poverty, growth, transitions, death, prejudice and/or responsibilities. Your heart will hunt along with them all for that one moment that &quot;it&quot; all comes together. But like most lives the thing that we most want is often in the way of real life and one must make choices often leaving the dreams and desires of our heart behind. <br />I liked this book because of the depth of the characters and the descriptiveness with which McCullers writes. However I felt it was a bit too long and didn't really wrap things up completely at the end. I would recommend the book purely for the message it contains....stay true to your dreams and stay hungry for life even if you are lonely, the best company is often in your own heart.

I mean, it is in its own way.  <br />Someone mentioned that this album is &quot;human&quot; and they were right; the lyrics and music labor to penetrate all audiences and those of you who are unaffected I believe are in the minority.

0553278223|5.0|In the half century after most of it was written, as Bob Dylan would say, things have changed.  Racial relations are different, we know there are not water filled canals on Mars, no Martian dead cities, electronics are digital, rock has become the most popular music, and so on.<br />This novel is more of a love poem, and finally a eulogy for the human race.  I suppose it is science fiction.  Doing what the best science fiction does: illuminating our lives in the present with the metaphor of a future time.  It contains one of my favorite Bradbury short stories I read a long time ago in junior high - &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot;.  A story of an automated house trying to futilely provide for its deceased human inhabitants.<br />A moving and beautiful work.  I only hope we have learned from its teachings.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Freaky Friday is one of the best family films from Disney.  Entertainingly hilarious featuring an Oscar-nominated performance by Jamie Lee Curtis, teen queen Lindsay Lohan is wonderful as a hormonal teenage daughter whose relationship with her perfect mother (Dr. Coleman) is a bitter one.  Lohan's performance pushes her past any given by Hilary Duff and is as grown-up as that of Curtis's.  It's unanimousally agreed: Freaky Friday rocks!
0140177396|5.0|While I enjoy huge sprawling novels, the stories I like best are lean and short.  Not allowing subplots or extraneous characters to bog down the main story.  This is one of those stories.<br />Set in the depression, the novel is the story of George and Lennie.  Lennie is &quot;slow&quot; and depends on George to do the right thing.  This dependence leads to the grievous, yet inevitable, ending.<br />I don't enjoy this work as much as I could say it is one of the most moving stories I've read.  I think this is superior to The Grapes of Wrath.  This is a heartbreaking work of staggering genius.

I would give it away,but my mates dont want it either.<BR>DONT GET SUCKED IN<BR>DONT BUY IT
B000050FEN|5.0|Director:  David Fincher<BR>Cast:  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, John C. McGinley, Kevin Spacey.<BR>Running Time:  127 minutes.<BR>Rated R for extreme violence, gore, and language.<br />One of the most gruesome, yet intriguing mystery/suspense thrillers of the past decade, \\"Seven\\" is widely considered one of the best of its kind-and rightfully so.  It is a film that will test the stomachs of all its viewers, yet even those who feel queasy throughout the entire picture stay engaged because of the impeccable acting, top-notch direction, and riveting cinematography.<br />Detective William Somerset (a stupendous, touching performance from the always admirable Morgan Freeman) is looking forward to retirement-he has had it with all the horror, stress, and dead partners that accompany his job.  His young protégé, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), is looking forward to follow in his footsteps, but realizes that his feet are in too deep as a serial killer who calls himself \\"John Doe\\" begins to parade around the city-killing each of his victims in a pattern that references to the seven deadly sins.  As both detectives uncover more of the truth about the horrific killer, they become entangled in a ghoulish scheme that will shock them.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a fine performance as Mills's distressed wife.<br />Director David Fincher creates a dark and disturbing film, using Freeman and Pitt well (both give slightly dark, somber performances) to his advantage.  The unique camera angles, explosive chase sequences, and vivid crime scenes enhance the picture, making \\"Seven\\" an inimitable thriller that is so effective, powerful, and alarming that it will scare your socks right off.  The finale is one of the most electrifying of all time, pitting Pitt (no pun intended) against the evil murderer in an emotional, unforgettable showdown.  A rare cinematic experience that will make you have nightmares for weeks-but enjoy every second of it.  The Platinum Series DVD is phenomenal, which includes many deleted scenes, alternate endings, and a DVD-rom exclusive that allows you to look into the killer's mind.  A captivating, spellbinding look at how the horrors of society can simply drive an ordinary man mad.
0393057658|5.0|I am almost embarrassed at how much I enjoyed this book.  I purposely avoided it for a long time annoyed at how much hype it was getting thinking surely it wasn't a 'real' baseball book for true fans.  I gave in recently when the paperback came out and must admit that I am dumbfounded with delight.  This is a GREAT book for true fans of the game and even for those who know next to nothing about baseball!  Michael Lewis is a remarkably gifted author who can tell a great story, entertain, and inform with amazing ease while writing in excellent prose.  His central focus in this book is &quot;Why have the Oakland A's won so many baseball games lately with such a relatively low payroll and so few established stars?&quot;  You will quickly find out if you are a fan of &quot;Old School&quot; baseball or the &quot;New Wave&quot; thinking running through Oakland, Toronto, and even the Red Sox.  Many will take strong stands along these sides and may even rate their opinion of this book solely upon that.  Either way, this book is great entertainment and is very much worthy of a place on your bookshelf for &quot;read it cover-to-cover keepers&quot;!
078322611X|5.0|Director:  Phil Alden Robinson<BR>Cast:  Kevin Costner, Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones, Burt Lancaster, Ray Liotta, Timothy Busfield.<BR>Running Time:  106 minutes.<BR>Rated PG for some mild language.<br />Labeled as a sports film but so much more, \\"Field of Dreams\\" is a breathtaking, touching, and mystical adaptation of W.P. Kinsella's delicate baseball novel \\"Shoeless Joe\\".  On a mysterious night while working in his farm, average family man Ray Kinsella (played by Kevin Costner in a heartwarming, brilliant performance) hears the faint whispers proclaiming \\"if you build it, they will come\\".  Ray has no idea what this means and why he hears these voices, but he is determined to find answers to his questions.  With the guidance and support of his loving wife (Amy Madigan), Kinsella decides to use all of his family's money and land to build a beautiful baseball field-not knowing its purpose and why Ray felt he had to build it.<br />Ray is also compelled to track down a once-famous novelist (James Earl Jones) and an unknown baseball star named \\"Moonlight Graham\\" (Burt Lancaster) because they are somehow connected to the spiritually enveloped ball diamond.  Seen by only himself, his family, and the novelist, Ray's field becomes the playing ground for the spirits of former ballplayers whose careers were cut short by fate and tragedy.  As Ray learns more about the purpose of the field, he continues to lose money from not growing crop.  He is on the brink of losing his land and home, but Ray is still obligated to understand his true destiny-and he believes it is the field.<br />Kevin Costner delivers one of the defining performances of his career, capturing Kinsella in a fashion that only he could produce.  James Earl Jones is a fine choice as the cloistered activist Terrance Mann.  \\"Field of Dreams\\" cultivates from being a standard baseball story and becomes a miraculous metaphor for the American dream, the love for family, and the incredible bond of father and son.  It is a tale that symbolizes what is good about cinema, how movies can carry an audience into a fantasy world that we all wished we were still a part of, and brings out the child in all of us.  A brilliant feature for the whole family.
B000023X9W|4.0|There's pretty much two sides to &quot;Neil Young&quot;, the &quot;Rockin' In The Free World&quot; side, and the side that's found here on &quot;Silver And Gold&quot;. This is a group of songs that would go well with his &quot;Unplugged&quot; album, or any of his mellowest work. The kind of stuff your Grandfather would sing to you on the porch, but 10 times better. Everything here is really good, but I especially like &quot;Red Sun&quot;, &quot;Distant Camera&quot;, and the excellent &quot;Razor Love&quot;. If I only kept 5 of his albums, this would probably be one of them.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I highly recommend this film to those who prefer something that is not what it seems, to those who do not judge a book by its cover.<br />  This film takes you on a journey through troubled mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) who to some &quot;is Toby Mcguires Ungerdog&quot; which I find to be so far from the truth. Jake goes beyond the borders of Mcguire and takes you inside the mind and through a parallel of time travel and theory, all as a highschool student. With the help of a bizzare accident, and a strangely mangled Rabbit Companion only reffered to as...now would I give that away...<br />  With a classic soundtrack, lighting and vivid color, camera work (pay note to a particular scene as the camera lingers the highschool halls) and cast of Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, and Patrick Swayze in the mix this film does justice to an eventual classic cult. See for yourself, through the eyes of Donnie Darko.
B000002BHE|5.0|This album is great. This album and Let's talk about love is, pretty much the same. But this one is a little bit better.<BR> <BR>Here is many goods songs in this album like:<BR>&quot;It's all coming back&quot;<BR>&quot;Falling in to you&quot;<BR>&quot;Make you happy&quot;<BR>&quot;All by my self&quot;<BR>&quot;I love you&quot;<BR>&quot;River deep,mountain high&quot;<BR>&quot;Fly&quot; <br />This album is not for kids. But some kids like it. This album is for teenagers or, for adults. And I really recomend to buy this album. Good listening! Trust me. And I hope this review was helpful.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A work of sheer brilliance. As a lover of D.A's work in film I must say that this film is pieced together with the practicality and ethic of an epic tragedy. As I watched I found his usage of frame and camera work to be quite facinating. Being one who has worked with a steady cam, I must say he knows exactly what he is doing.<BR>     The characters are so simply drawn out and with a dark grace put together for you. I find it not just a film about narcotics but about how life takes toll on our everyday situations, as displayed with Ellen Burstyn's character of a widow drawn into the realm so similiar to her sons, yet still so blind to it.  <BR>      The usage of color and light, as well as angle brings us directly into the characters lives, giving us a piece of what they hunger for, and in the end how we realize we all hunger for something so similiar. Brilliance at its best.

6305538018|5.0|Cronenberg is a genius in a way. He leads us into the world of a new generation of console games and 3D virtual reality. Everything happens the way the characters you are projected into decide, and yet your deeper psyche can influence the characters. You liberate in such a game your most sombre death instinct and psychotic tendencies. You become the character and the character becomes you. You are entirely dominated by a logic that comes from the character and from the deepest layers of your impulses and passions. You burn up yourself in such a game and you do not know any more where reality is and where you stand in it. Everything becomes both virtual and real. You are lost and unable to make a decision and get out of this virtual world which is just as real as reality. Reality disappears by being blended with virtuality. The game becomes a nightmarish experience and a psychotic trip. You use any weapon at your disposal, in the game or in reality, to kill and destroy yourself and other characters or individuals. Death is at the end of the line, death of your mind, death of your psyche, death of your individuality, death of your freedom and free choosing mind. This film is dangerous because it reveals a real danger we are confronted to : playing any game builds in you a second nature that is rooted in your most morbid passions.<br />Dr jacques COULARDEAU
B00000AF95|5.0|This cd shows the Heavy Metal side of KISS.With songs like\\"I've had enough\\",\\"Burn bitch Burn\\" or \\"Under the gun\\",Kiss shows how to play melodic,and heavy songs.<BR>I love how Paul sings the first song,or for example \\"Thrills in the nights\\".I love how Eric CArr plays,I just love that album!<BR>The interesting fact about this record is that Gene plays only in his own songs.Paul plays on bass in two tracks ,and on three plays Jean Beavoir.Beaside that this is one of the best Kiss records from the eighties!
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I purchased Avril's 1st album for my 8 year old daughter - didn't expect much, but that record was wonderful.  The sounds were interesting, her voice was well recorded, the songs were good and the playing was terrific.  It was like a textbook on how to make an interesting new pop/rock record.  This new record is so inferior that it makes me wonder about the inside story.  The sounds are mediocre, the songs are poor, the performnaces by the guitar players are subaverage - not the same band.  Even Avril's voice is not recorded the same way - and the creative uses of harmony and looping are not there.  Sophomore slump or something else?
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Who cares that Slipknot aren't as so-called &quot;heavy&quot; as before? If all you listen to is the nu-metal of the last five years, you don't even know what heavy is. Heaviness comes not from nonstop bashing and screaming, but from variety and dynamics. That's the more competent type of &quot;heavy&quot; that Slipknot is competently exploring on this album. Out of the severe glut of predictable nu-metal drones we have these days, Slipknot has the best chance of rising above the dreck, and this surprisingly interesting album proves that they are well on their way to doing just that. Here we have real variety as evidenced by two acoustic ballads (gasp!) in &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Vermilion Pt. 2,&quot; near-industrial in &quot;The Virus of Life,&quot; and a great slow-burn intro in &quot;Prelude 3.0.&quot; Meanwhile Slipknot's great strength is their small army of percussionists, which adds real beef to the sound, as can be heard in this album's true winners &quot;The Blister Exists,&quot; &quot; Duality,&quot; and &quot;Before I Forget.&quot;<br />This new sense of dynamics and experimentation proves that Slipknot is about to rise above the narrow confines of their category, but large parts of this album are still stuck in the worst tendencies of nu-metal. With a few exceptions, the guitars and bass are stiff and deficient in personality; while the vocals are mostly the monotonous groan-to-scream that makes much of nu-metal so annoying (though Corey Taylor is adding some less-predictable grunge emotion to his work ethic). Also, the two electronic members of the band are underutilized, usually only supplying annoying sound effects, or brief flourishes that could be performed by a single part-time keyboardist. But even with these weaknesses, Slipknot is truly on the verge of genre-shattering brilliance, and I bet it'll happen on their next album. Now it's up to their fans to let them develop and improve, as all musicians should. [~doomsdayer520~]
B000089CJI|5.0|listen to the 30 second bits...you'll be hooked! this is what makes me go to classes during the week!  i just get in my car, pop in the postal service, and away i go!  i love #1 (it's what got me hooked) and i LOVE the first 5!  the others are ok, but those first 5 are great!  i dont know what kind of music to fit this into (emo i guess?) but it's GREAT! i love it so much!  i use the quotes all the time, its great for listing to and just undwinding!<br />*****<BR>5 stars!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Allow me to begin by saying that while I love Slipknot's first two albums and I love Mudvayne, I don't close myself off to all but the harshest music.  I love Sublime, Tool, Pearl Jam, Primus, and a whole lot more stuff. So when I listened to the new 'knot album, I wasn't listening for what I had already decided it should sound like.  I just heard an album. And let me tell you, it was very good. It is very good.  I will go out on a limb and say that it will likely be the greatest album released in the year of our Lord two thousand and four.    But now that I've told you that, I can tell you this, having heard and loved all three albums: Slipknot haven't sold out.  It's all here; better percussion than any other metal band (The Blister Exists), the stubbornly anti-religious lyrics (Opium of the People), the obvious radio single (Duality), the fan-friendly anthem (Pulse of the Maggots), the slow-burning stalker song (The Virus of Life).  Slipknot's sound is harsher, bigger and angrier to boot.  All the members get a workout and contribute to an incredibly overwhelming barrage of sound.    With so much in common with the other albums, what's all the fuss about? I'll tell you, and then I'll tell you why it's B.S.  Two major bones of contention are as follows:    Slipknot have obviously sold out: they don't cuss anymore!  To begin with, although there isn't any bleep-worthy profanity on this album, I saw Slipknot live on May 9, and let me tell you, Corey has no aversion to cursing up a storm. Besides, is there still any shock value in that? Is that still a requirement for street cred? Still, fans of the first two albums will want to know what's going on. Well, I'll tell you: Corey has grown up. Truly great lyrics, printed on paper, could be confused for poetry, and Corey leaped closer to this goal on the new album than ever before.    Slipknot has obviously sold out: there are wussy acoustic tracks on here!  Let me reiterate that I'm a fan of all kinds of music, including Alice in Chains' acoustic work, and I find it humorous and kind of sad when bands much better suited to heavy metal like Godsmack try to rip off Alice with a mediocre acoustic EP. Leave the acoustic work to people who can actually pull it off, please. But after listening to Circle, Vermilion pt. 2, etc. on Vol. 3, it's clear to me that this isn't the case here. Corey and his bandmates have grown into songwriters talented enough to make an acoustic, melodic song work, and besides, isn't it nice to have a few breathers in the middle of all these grinding guitars and rapid-fire drums?    In conclusion, Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses) might not be the best Slipknot album ever. But it probably is 2004's best album, and you should definitely buy it, no matter who you are.
0553210246|5.0|When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character.  The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\".  He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption.  His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.<br />In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.<br />Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry.  Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.<br />Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain.  He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas.  However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head.  He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol.  I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it.  Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard.adventures like DeFoe or Dumas.  However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head.  He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol.  I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it.  Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard.
B000268QB2|4.0|All the people comparing this album to Radiohead and Coldplay obviously aren't fans of either band.  They're kind of like this friend I have who hears a song and says &quot;hey, don't you think this band sounds like...&quot;  This is a really good album with several songs that you'll sing at the top of your lungs as you cruise down the street (This is the Last Time, Bend and Break, Can't Stop Now).  Everyone wants to compare Coldplay to Radiohead because Chris Martin was strongly influenced by Thom and the boys, but the music is quite different if you actually listen to all of their albums.  Now people want to lump Keane in with those two outstanding bands and say that nothing distinguishes them.  The thing that distinguishes bands like these is the fact that these bands write songs that mean something.  When bands strive to do this, the songwriter's soul is bare.  Thom Yorke, Chris Martin, and the boys from Keane are different people with different experiences and that comes out in the music.  If you want to talk about generic music, then look no further than American rock music.  Before the Strokes and the White Stripes took off, who didn't sound just like everyone else?  This is a good album and is worthy of a listen, but if you are not a big fan of Coldplay or Radiohead then you might feel like some of these other reviewers.  By the way, what exactly is wrong with Coldplay?  Nothing.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I rented this movie anticipating a cheesy action flick. I was beyond pleasantly suprised with what I saw. This is a well rounded movie. The drama in this movie is severly over looked in reviews of this movie. Christian Bale's performance is five stars, his facial expression during the furnace scene is priceless. The music matches perfect to every scene as it adds to the mood. It is a modern day version of farenheit 451. But better as it reaches out to a persons humanity more direct. It it entertaining and can very easily watch it again. The action scenes are well done and the movie does a good job making them seem realistic. Well written script with well timed twists. How this movie didn't become a blockbuster is beyond me, it is simply one of the best movies of the year. GREAT ACTION, GREAT WRITING, GREAT DIRECTING, and GREAT ACTING. A very entertaining movie that has been badly overlooked. I highly recommended it. You will fill good after watching it.
B000002MG1|5.0|I just had to buy this album after all the hype and reviews that surrounded it. R.E.M. are my favourite band of all time, and this is the second album I bought (after &quot;Out Of Time&quot;) and I was, literally, amazed...<br />This album, especially compared to &quot;Out Of Time&quot;, is dark and moody, but every song is special, and every song brings it's own point across, and, more often than not, means something different to everyone that hears them.<br />Well, what do we have? Drive, the album starter, is a fantastic piece of music with heavy hitting guitar chords and moving lyrics... it's my favourite song on the cd, but it's so hard to pick just one!<br />A couple of tracks down is The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite. Erm, ok I lied when I said every song brings it's point across ;) It's a fun, happy piece of fluff that anyone can love, even if they don't know what's going on. Callmewhenyoutrytowakeherup!<br />...Do I even need to tell you why Everybody Hurts is great? This is a powerful, moving piece that any teenager can relate to. It really is fantastic. If you weren't moved by this, than you've got a heart of stone!<br />Man On The Moon, again, needs no introduction. Their first song dedicated to Andy Kauffman (followed by the inferior &quot;Great Beyond&quot;), this is an absolute classic that is reason enough to buy the cd.<br />The two closers, Nightswimming and Find The River, are brilliant. I don't think they could have closed this moody, emotional album in any better way... they just work so well, with each other, and with the rest of the album.<br />The other songs, including the instrumental, are all great songs that are more than worthy of recognition (particularly Star Me Kitten).<br />This album is a must own for anyone who claims they know good music. Trust me: Buy it now!!!
0316666343|5.0|This is a great novel.  It was hard to put it down.  The character of Susie is smart, funny and a wonderful person to learn about.  The family dynamics after the murder is unexpected.  The author has the ability to think like a 14 year old girl and understands what is important to her.  I really enjoyed The Lovely Bones and I am going to read more by this author.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|John Barry's masterpiece is simply one of the most breathtaking, moving film scores of all time. The rich variety of themes, and his trademark sweeping orchestration are unforgetteble. Most stunning, perhaps, is that the music that captures the epic grandeur of the American West better than any other was written by an Englishman, albeit one who has adopted the US as his home.    This CD does not present the score \\"in its entirety,\\" as the liner notes claim, but there is a huge amount not available until now, and at the low list price, this is a must have for anybody who enojys film music.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Incredible work from one of the finest song stylists in contemporary music. I agree that it is too short, and I would have enjoyed another 4 or 5 songs to add to the already stellar song list. Diana Krall has a voice that resonates pure enjoyment to the listener's ears. For all jazz or pop enthusiasts who appreciate great music.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I have loved this CD for about as long as it's been available--about 15 years. Some tracks are so uplifting, and all are wonderful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the series when it first appeared on t.v. and I was sadly dissapointed when it was cancelled. I was very happy to find it in the store. I spent one whole weekend watching all the episodes back to back. I recommend this DVD to anyone who likes to get carried away with what they watch. I hope they make a movie out of Firefly I will be the first one in line to see it.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is definetly their best album. Yes its not as heavy as the old albums but it still is great. Those who say its not good aren't slipknot fans. You can tell they put in all their effort and time put into this album.  If you even like slipknot a little this is a must get!
B000003TA4|3.0|Everybody makes such a fuss about this album. Sure, it has some great rockers like &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Breed&quot;, but other than those, Nevrmind doesn't live up to anything much, including all the hoopla people make about it supposedly being &quot;the best&quot; album the 90's. Many other albums are much better contenders. &quot;Come As You Are&quot; gets stale really quick because it's so repetitive. Once you heard the first verse and chorus, you've practically heard the whole song. I never cared for &quot;In Bloom&quot; when I first heard it over ten years ago, and I still don't like it now. I think it has to do with that obnoxious guitar at the beginning and in the chorus. The bass really carries that song during the verses, and it's a shame the guitar has to intrude and ruin everything. I liked &quot;Lithium&quot; alot; it's not much of a rock song, but it sure is a great pop song. It's amazing how light and tame it sounds these days. It just doesn't have the same hard-edge I remember it having years ago. Kurt's voice sounds a bit airy and breezy, and it definitely gives the song a laid-back feel. &quot;Polly&quot; is very dull and not worth saying much about. You would've figured Kurt could've been a little more explicit and about the details of what exactly happened to this poor girl, but he just drops vague lines devoid of any emotion. It's hard to be moved by the ambiguousness of such a song. It always seemed like he was brushing off the fact that she was captured and tortured. You'd never know the song was about rape unless you found out the meaning of the song from Kurt's interviews. &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; is just an obnoxious wall of screaming. &quot;Lounge Act&quot; and &quot;Stay Away&quot; have excellent basslines, but, again, Kurt's screaming ruins any build-up of tension or emotion. I liked &quot;On a Plain&quot;. It's the most upbeat song on the album and it has a good vibe to it. &quot;Something in the Way&quot; is dull and vague like &quot;Polly&quot;; only this time &quot;Something&quot; is about a fictitious story Kurt made up. In it, he sings about what it would be like living under a bridge. Boring stuff. Too bad he didn't choose a better song to close the album with; &quot;Lithium&quot; would've been a better closer, and would've summed up the album and all the mood swings of the lyrics perfectly: &quot;I love you, I miss you, I like it, I killed you/I'm not gonna crack&quot;. Too bad he cracked.<br />2.5 /5  <br />Instead of listening to Nevermind for the umpteenth time, I suggest anything by Garbage (Butch Vig is the drummer!), and Angelfish.
B000002IZM|4.0|In many ways, this is less a true film score than an album: 1) some of the pieces included here have not been used in the movie; 2) although it works when envisioned in conjunction with the original film (as emphasized by the well-chosen audio clips inserted in a few tracks), it is also successful as a stand-alone work. This CD's soundworld has an internal coherence that is matched by few of Vangelis' other albums. And this coherence is such that it comes through both when listening to the work from the first track to the last (the sequencing order is partly inspired by the film's progression) and when using the random option to navigate in it. This is a strange and wondrous world in which you can easily lose yourself: I suffer from tinnitus and this is an album I often go back to - a very nocturnal work, one that can relax the listener and induce him/her in a dreamlike state.
044651652X|5.0|I loved this book - the romance, sadness, tragedy, Iowa - everything.  Yes, it deals with adultery - not the best thing in the world, but your heart just breaks for the lovers.  Or at least mine did.  And I saw some of the bridges, the countryside and even the house where the movie was made.  I could just FEEL the story.  And okay, I admit it, I asked where Francesca was buried.  Guess the story had me so completely believing that it was real life - but it felt like it was real life!  You just want so badly for them to have been together - and happy.
B000000WCV|3.0|Perhaps to figure out how any listener would react to owning this album, it's important to gauge how and why you play most of your albums.  Homework is a breakthrough and a true original, bringing the DJ dancehall spirit into an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink experiment in sonic trailblazing.  Still, in the six years or so I've owned Homework, I've listened to it only a handful of times.  I think it lacks the essential qualities of the other great records of the techno explosion in the late 90's - the grand drama of DJ Shadow's Endtroducing..., the spunky accessibility of Chemical Brother's Dig Your Own Hole, or, to go a bit later, the go for broke propulsion of Basement Jaxx's Remedy.  If the originality of the music is enough for you, it certainly is here in spades, but it's hard to deny this record is distancing at best and forgettable at worst.
B00005AR3G|4.0|It may not be worthy of Masterpiece status, but The Emporer's New Groove will always be remembered as the funny Disney film.  It is very alike Saturday Night Live in the way the humor plays out.  The voices are great, as well as the animation.  See it.  I highly reccomend it.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This film is absolutly fabulous!  It is so cute.  I dont think I have ever seen 2 actors with better chemistry, and these guys are only children!  Beond 2 thumbs up, this is a must see for anyone who isnt afraid to be a little bit open to a lot of corny cheezy stuff.
B00005JKOI|4.0|Molly Ringwald did an good job in this film.  The movie wasn't the best brat pack movie, but it is enjoyable.  The supporting cast is okay, and the romance you are able to relate to.  All, in all good, and heartfelt.  See it, if you love teen romance movies.
B000035Z3K|5.0|I love all of the old Universal Monster Movies and I love all the DVD versions that Universal has issued.  They have done it right, giving us deluxe editions of The Wolf Man and The Mummy with all the bells and whistles.  Of all of these, my favorite is Todd Browning's Dracula.  Dracula may not be considered the best of the Universal films (that title usually goes to Bride of Frankenstein) but it certainly is the best DVD.<br />EVERYTHING is on this DVD.  There is a wonderful DOCUMENTARY, The Road to Dracula.  Amazingly, this is hosted by Carla Laemmle - the niece of the producer who actually ACTED in the movie.  (She is the girl in the stagecoach who had the first line of dialogue in the film - indeed, in any sound horror film.)  Clive Barker also adds valuable commentary.  Although Barker is at the cutting edge (pun not intended) of hard-core horror, he still has great appreciation and insight about the classics.<br />FEATURE COMMENTARY:  This is provided by David J. Skal, the noted Dracula/Vampire expert.  Along with the documentary, this should tell you everything you ever wanted to learn about Dracula.<br />SPANISH LANGUAGE VERSION:  It is now a famous story that, after Browning and his crew finished work for the day, a Spanish cast and crew would come in at night to film the same movie for the Spanish-speaking markets.  The Spanish crew was very competitive and many critics say that the Spanish version is actually better.  I do not agree with this.  True, there are more interesting camera moves, but most of what we come to Dracula for is the Bela Lugosi performance - not to mention Dwight Frye as Renfeild with his inimitable laugh.  The Spanish version is also great because it is a more accurate realization of the shooting script.<br />NEW SCORE:  The old Universal movies did not yet have scored music.  A few years ago, Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet were commissioned to write a full score.  It is excellent and it is also included on the disc.  You can watch it with or without.  I usually prefer without - I'll always think of the opening set to Swan Lake.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|After watching the trailler for \\"The Riddick chronicles\\" and finding out that it was a kind of a sequel, I went after the first movie in the Riddick series. I usualy like science fiction movies, but I don't expect them all to be great movies. So, in this way, \\"Pitch Black\\" was a very good surprise. The only other science fiction movie that surprised me as much as this one (I was expecting little and got more than I thought I would) is \\"Event horizon\\".<br />The plot is not original: a spaceship transporting a group of people crashes in a seemingly deserted planet. Soon, they discover that the planet had been previously reached by human beings, but now they're all gone. What happened? When they find a model showing them that the planet is immersed in a total eclypse every twenty-two years (and the cycle will be closing very soon again) they start to worry.<br />Right, there are many incoherent situations and plot holes in \\"Pitch black\\", but there are three things that make this movie good: 1. Most of the characters are well-developed, each with his or her own singularities; when they start to die (as they will obviously do) and the troubles begin, the viewer cares for them. 2. Director David Twohy knows how to build the tension on screen, using the lights/no-lights situations; also, the visual effects of the \\"natural inhabitants\\" of the planets are very effeective to the audience. 3. Vin Diesel surprised me once again as an actor full of resources, even if always basing his characters on a macho figure; for an example, Caparzo (from \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"), Varik (from \\"Boiler Room\\") and Riddick may look alike, but if you think well, you'll find out that each has its own personality: Caparzo as the bearlish friend you can always count with, Varik as a tough but gentle guy, and Riddick as a mean, cool and violent outlaw.<br />So, that is to say that \\"Pitch black\\" was a nice surprise, and now I want to watch \\"The Riddick chronicles\\". \\"Pitch black\\" was deservedly nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film in 2000 (lost to \\"The matrix\\").<br />Grade 8.2/10ted for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film in 2000 (lost to \\"The matrix\\").<br />Grade 8.2/10
B0001UL7RY|3.0|It's surprising how petty people can be with reviews.  Especially since it's fairly evident that anyone giving this a straight &quot;1&quot; hasn't actually heard it.<br />I recently came into this album because my mother thinks I actually like commercialized pop for some reason or another and I've just never had the heart to tell her I don't really want her gifts.<br />Anyhow, this isn't a horrible album.  I'm giving Avril credit for having writing credits on these songs, as low quality as they may be overall artistically.  The music is very methodical and it makes for easy listening, but the lyrics are hollow, with slight exceptions on two or three songs, which are only somewhat better.<br />But that doesn't mean the album deserves a single star.  Avril may be lacking any real substance and her image may be completely false (which is completely disgusting but has no real bearing on the music) but the melodies themselves are as pleasant as anything else on the &quot;Top 40&quot;.<br />Get this if you enjoy pop music and forget anyone who will judge you simply by your musical taste.  But to end this, I'd like to recommend Alanis' newest offering, &quot;So Called Chaos&quot; in addition or instead of this.  If you're looking for something new from a good female artist that includes quality songwriting and lyrics a bit deeper than a puddle, you'll definitely want to check that out.
B0000524CY|4.0|I still say Linda Blair should have won an Academy Award for her performance here.  I mean, think about it.  How hard could it have been for a little girl to be so disgusting &amp; evil.  The Exorcist has been called the scariest movie of all time, &amp; stil remains.  <br />This unseen version does some good things and a couple bad things.  First, the flashes of demon faces is a brilliant touch and manages to make you feel quite uneasy.  The infamous &quot;spider walk&quot; scene truly takes you off guard the first time you see it.  By the second time, it starts to look kinda silly.  Still very scary though.  <br />Exorcist is one of the greatest horror movies, not because of how scary it is, but simply because its a good movie.  By todays standards its a little slow, but the story of a Devil possesed little girl still has as much power today.  The final added scene is pointless.  The final scene kinda ruins it, but I'm I dont want to spoil it for anybody so buy it.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Mona Lisa Smile is a movie with some heart. I say *some*, in the sense that it won't get your pulse racing with either joy or outrage, but it does have a steady pace. It is a thoughtful story about young women finding themselves and developing true friendships in an era when they were not valued beyond their marriages by the rest of society.   <br />Julia Roberts plays a fledgling Art History instructor in her first year at Wellesley College.  This is the 1950s, so her somewhat \\"Bohemian\\" politics become a source of controversy to the staff of that conservative school as well as the elitist parents of the all-female student body (personally, I didn't quite buy that angle to Julia's character; she's just too warm and sweet to pull it off).But the girls love her, as she cares about their lives and takes the time to counsel them as individuals. Meanwhile, she has romantic entanglements of her own to sort out and is finding her own way in life even as she helps her students to find theirs.<br />Ironically, although Julia Roberts is the lead, there are some much more outstanding performances by Julia Stiles and Kirsten Dunst.  I enjoyed the somewhat nostalgic look back at the `50s styles and the feeling of innocence in those times.  The students and their instructors face realistic life challenges in this story - what will I do with my life, who am I, what is true love, and when am I really a grownup? - that we can all relate to.  These are the best reasons to see this movie from my point of view.<br />The paranoia of communism and the general oppression of that decade are also explored, perhaps a bit much in my opinion. Marriage is presented as detrimental to the freedom and individualism of the women who get &quot;trapped&quot; into it.  There is a statement being made by this story, which practically shouts itself at the audience \\"Isn't it great that women's rights have come so far since then?!?\\"  Yes, indeed it is great that we have so many more choices now.  I justwish the feminist agenda wasn't so heavyhanded, so obvious here.  <br />So, go see this movie for the warm look back at America's last days of innocence and politically correct conservativism.  See it because you like stories of young women coming of age.  Expect to have a nice time with no huge highs or lows emotionally.  <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
0385720920|1.0|This book was obviously only half as inspired as his others. I finished this book, but barely. I yawned through the last half. if it shows this has a high rating, ignore it.
B000148KK2|1.0|Don't waste your dime - unless you like singers with a vocal range of three always wrong notes.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|In Short: It does not measure up to all the hoopla.<br />If you have seen the movie and were not impressed by it, do not feel bad. There's nothing wrong with you. A lot of people around you, suffering from Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome (see the review by gregy55902), will try to make you feel stupid. You are not. You were able to see the movie for what it is: not much. If you have not seen the movie, try to see if you can find a copy in a library, like I did. The less you spend, the better you will feel.<br />A lot of reviews claim that those of us who didn't like it, essentially didn't get it. For those who 'got it', it was several things: real, with unique plot, idea that is like poetry, introspective genius and what not. The reality is that the movie is pretty unreal and shoddy. What has worked: cinematography, music, Bill Murray's acting. What hasn't worked: the rest.<br />A lot of priases of Sophia Coppola have been sung. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably in the departments she was responsible for. The two main characters are supposed to be in Tokyo just for a week. Those who have traveled to any big city in the world know that despite language problems it's hard to feel 'trapped' if you are there only for a week. If the claim is that they are feeling trapped in their current lives, then much more would have happened between them. It didn't.<br />About Charlotte being 'lost'. Looks like Yale's admission standards have really fallen. Their philosophy graduate is listening to popular &quot;You are ok. I'm ok&quot; type audio tape for resolving her existential doubts, does not read a single book, looks perpetually bored, instead of being excited, in a place full of culture that she has never visited before. There is no deep meaning to the the shallow development of Charlotte's character. Is it a reflection of Coppola's own life that lacks real experiences? Those close to her can answer that better. Charlotte's &quot;walks&quot; around the city with the 'lost' expression of her face seemed like a naive way of trying to link the title of the film to its content. The 'friends' of Charlotte that they spend the kareoke night with were relatively underdeveloped. And what was the point of nudie bar? All cities have them. They didn't spend much time in there anyway, so how did it help the story. The local culture has been captured only in the form of stereotypes. <br />The reason all the favorable reviews are asking you to go beyond this and that in order to appreciate the movie is because the lack of substance and obvious flaws in the movie. Claiming that less favorable reviews are necessarily from the people who are otherwise interested in car chases, slap-stick comedies or run-of-the-mill romances is patronizing and ignorant. The real take-home message is that this movie has been grossly overrated. <br />Some of the professional reviewers might have had vested interests in promoting Coppola's daughter. But the movie-goers don't owe anyone anything. There are good,well-rounded AND intriguing movies out there; this ain't one of them. But if you are looking for a movie that you want to call cool because everyone else does, this is the one for you.
B000002GGU|5.0|RECKLESS was Bryan Adams' second great album in a row, and it also defined 80s mainstream rock. The perfect blend of Springsteen/Seger heartland rock, Allmans/Outlaws guitar rock, and Eagles/Steve Miller/Fleetwood Mac pop, topped with Adams' own Joe Cocker/Ray Charles-influenced rasp, this album featured great hooks and hot guitars. Although no one knew it at the time, this provided the template for bands like Warrant and Firehouse. This album contains everything from powerful rockers to beautiful ballads. Some people call it bubblegum, but I totally disagree, especially considering that Adams currently advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist. Adams would make records as good as this one, but he never made one better.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Very cool Vampire story! Kate Beckinsale owns whatever movie she is in! I loved the high tech hardware used in this movie! If Angel and Buffy had this kind of Fire Power Sunnydale and LA would be safer places to live!
B000002GJS|5.0|WAKING UP THE NEIGHBOURS is the last great album that Bryan Adams did until ROOM SERVICE. It sounds a lot like Def Leppard (he used that band's producer, \\"Mutt\\" Lange, for this one), but somewhat earthier. This album contains plenty of great rockers, but also increases his ballad quotient. His next couple of albums would turn him into a fairly faceless adult contemporary artist, but here he was still good for some great field-day-ready rockers.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I hated this cd. I am a huge slipknot fan and hate talking bad about these gods of metal but I dont understand what happened. The lyrics were blah, the back up vocals were horrid, and coreys not even trying to scream anymore. All the &quot;heavy&quot; songs sound like bad punk music and all the soft songs while they show talent just arnt slipknot. Honestly this is just a poor stone sour rip off. If your a really fan you will hate it. Buy it used if you feel the need to buy it at all.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|For all the naysayers of Avril's last album: you might want to think about her again.  This album is really much better than the last one, in my opinion.  I listened to it for the first time today, and I really enjoyed it.  The absence of the Matrix as her production team really doesn't hurt her material or the overall sound of the record.  I especially liked TOGETHER, TAKE ME AWAY, and of course, DON'T TELL ME.  The lyrics seem much more mature than the last album which indicates that Avril is growing as an artist and as a person.  She may be punk and anti-Britney, but she sure is good at what she does best:  collecting the angst and darker side of the teen experience into a record that everyone can appreciate and enjoy.
B0000013G9|5.0|TLC is and will always be my favorite R&amp;B group of all-time. I didn't start listening to them only until after Left-Eyes death, by borrowing my friends cd. I always liked Left-Eye more than the others though because she rapped on some songs.<BR>My favorite songs are Creep, Kick Your Game, Red Light Special, Let's Do It Again, and If I Was Your Girlfriend.<BR>I really suggest you buy this cd as this is Hip-Hop/R&amp;B in the purest form possible.
B000062YAZ|1.0|Ive listened to Master Of Puppets by Metallica since it first came out and someone told me this is even better.They couldnt be more wrong.This crap isnt even music.Its auditory garbage.The guitars sound like nothing but static and the singer is even worse.Is it cool to have no talent? Is that why people call him one of the great vocalists?God its like the same two notes over and over again and I thought Hootie And The Blowfish had a terrible singer.These people sound like a bunch of morons who got fired for sleeping on their day jobs and decided to sing about Satan,sing the same two notes and pound on the same three chords.This might sound like music if youre a crack head but if not its just worthless noise.
B00004STPT|5.0|Of all my favorite classical soundtracks from the movies - Zimmer's &amp; Garrard's Gladiator disk is hands-down my all-time favorite.  More epic in scope that William's Jurassic Park and more hypnotic than Mansell's Requiem for a Dream.  For me this is the epitome of modern movie/classical music that I can sink into while allowing my mind to fantasize.  <br />I learned of this disk while visiting a handful of high quality/elite audio stores a few years back, many of which by default used this soundtrack as a showcase to demonstrate the range, depth, clarity and overall quality of their high-end sound systems &amp; speakers.<br />As an audio connoisseur of the classical genera I was blown away by the quality and dynamics of this compilation.  Yet, even on the mediocre system I have, the dynamics, range of emotion &amp; character this album exhibits are sublime - this IS a model showcase soundtrack.  It's kind of like an educational amusement park ride in the Roman Era in my eyes - full of adrenaline, hype, tragedy, love and entertainment and war - yet amazingly, not cheesy in the slightest.<br />I learned of this album well before seeing the movie, and in fact - after seeing Gladiator the movie, I was disappointed that it did not deliver what my imagination could while listening and focusing on this soundtrack.<br />From dramatic orchestral movements to soft and emotional sounds of drama and tension and beyond, the music of this album tells a complex story which does not require pictures to illustrate.  Let your imagination be the canvas and paint while listening to this story.<br />The vast range of emotions and sounds are nothing short of miraculous given how well this album seamlessly blends together such a wide variety of distinct emotions and even hype that are tied together within each musical aspect or `feel' of this epic.<BR>  <BR>Music can tell a story, this is true - we agree on this I'm sure. This entire album is a fluent story with an abundance of emotions, which have the possibility to become very entrancing when listened to in full.<br />This is not an album where you listen to a track here and there (if you do this and judge this CD on a track or two you are seriously short-changing this work - don't make that mistake).  Listen to this work of art all the way through then you can understand what makes it so full of life and so unique.<br />Listen all the way through; this is one soundtrack I can say without doubt - it is far better than the movie.  But you'll never know it unless you listen to just the soundtrack by itself.

Some of the standout tracks include &quot;Harder To Breathe,&quot; &quot;This Love,&quot; and &quot;Through With You.&quot;<br />Overall rating: Three and a half stars.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I just saw this movie and I can only say that Tim Burton is the greatest story teller that exists today in the modern movie industry (together with Spielberg that is). <BR> This isn't a great budget film that is supposed to hit the box office. It's a romantic, nostalgic commedy that combines the softness of Forest Gump with the travels of Baron Von Minhaouzen, making a movie that comes out of the heart of its creator.<BR> The basic element of the story isn't that much really and it mostly evolves around the relationsip of a father and a son. However, the way the director presents the story and all the adventures of the father makes the movie pleasant and fresh in a way that it is a fairy tale inside a fairy tale!! The actors help by the way...<BR> It's good to see great directors make great movies not for the box office but for those who like to see something different and genuine (I hope i spelled the world correctly!!)<BR> Bravo!!!!
B0001UL7RY|3.0|To say that Avril Lavigne's musical abilities have grown leaps and bounds would be a bit of a stretch.  I see several parallels between this album and her debut 'Let Go'...and believe it or not, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  So many people love to assume she's got nothing to say, and that's fine - everyone likes different things.  I happen to think Avril's outspoken ways make for interesting music.  Can you say that she's not unique?  Disregard the fact that all your peers think she's a &quot;poser punk&quot;, and listen to the stuff yourself and make up your own mind.  Although this isn't a masterpiece, it's far from horrible.   You won't find this CD constantly in my CD player, but it's really not as bad as most people make it out to be (ironically enough, most of these people haven't even listened to the album).  My favorite tracks include &quot;Together&quot;, the first single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; (abnormally catchy with an interesting take on a crumbled relationship).  In conclusion, just give it a listen.  Borrow a copy from a friend or just listen to some samples on the Internet.  You might be pleasantly surprised.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne, you say, is a poseur and a fake loser with an ego the size of Texas and misconception of her own talent. That is, pretty much, what you say, right?<br />Man, you must be green.<br />I'm not sure about any of her past songs and who wrote them, or created the melodies, and frankly, I couldn't care any less. This album is a great compilation of songs, without any of the disgusting fillers in 'Let Go' (The ones pretty much including 8 through 12). Also, Avril is given the credit for writing her own songs--all of them--on this album. In case you fellas didn't know it, if she hadn't, that would be illegal, and she would get the pants sued off of her.<br />The high points of the CD are: Take Me Away, Together, How Does It Feel, Nobody's Home, Forgotten, Fall to Pieces, and Slipped Away. And, before you think, &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; honestly, I've only liked this many songs THIS well on maybe ONE other album. That's not to say her songs are the greatest in the entire world of pop music, but they're pretty good, and almost all of them are on the same level of talent.<br />If you're not an avid Avril fan, but you sort of liked the sound of her old CD, this could be one you'd like. If it helps, I find her songs to be a darker mixture of Michelle Branch and Dido, if you can imagine....Although maybe less of the Dido portion.<br />-Embyr Bradson (5/30/04)
B00015HVI8|5.0|I like many of the other reviewers, had never seen this show.  Then one Christmas, as a gift and a replacement for Season 1 of Enterprise (not out as of this review) my brother purchased the boxed set of Stargate-SG1 Season 1 fron our local mall.  Being at home, graduating from college, I managed to find some free time to flip on the SCI-FI Channel and caught 3 episodes in season 1 and I was hooked.  I considered buying it from Amazon until I was hinted not to.  Even knowing one of the gifts I got for Christmas did not ruin the excitement when I opened the box.  Since then, I've had that same excitement every time I order a new season from Amazon (2-6).<br />Some might say that with the departure of Dr. Jackson, the show fell a notch or two, but I disagree.  If Micheal Shanks was unhappy at the time, let him be unhappy, and let the show staff pick someone who will exhibit the excitement I shared above. Coren Nemeck was that person.  Although the staff took a great risk with this action, ignore it because the intriguing plot lines and interesting twists will &quot;hook you&quot; regardless of who plays what role.<br />That being said I would encourage you to do what I did and start at Season 1 so you understand the plot lines and twists.  You'll be glad you did.  <br />A note on Enterprise:  What's the big deal, just because IMO a great show airs on a second rate network doesn't mean it's not great.  Tune in and you would realize that Season 2 was very much like Stargate in the idea that the entire season was focused on character development and ONE plot line.<br />Patiently waiting on Season 7 on DVD<BR>Excitedly watching and <BR>waiting on New SCI-FI Fridays (9-8C)<BR>Yours Truly,<BR>bigSG1Fan
B0001NBMBC|3.0|ok i realise everyone is different and some say its garbage and some say its fantastic, well thats great, every one is different.  HOWEVER i have been a fan since their first album and have always loved all of their stuff, this album came as a great shock, i was initialy thinking &quot;why have they sent me the wrong cd&quot; it didnt even sound like slipknot, but sure enough it was slipknot, i have read the comments by other buyers and i have to say there all right, slipknot have always been very tallented and still are BUT if you expect this album to blow your head off like the last ones im sorry to say that aint gonna happen, if u accept this album as music and foget what slipknot used to represent then yes its fantastic.  tallented but god im annoyed they dont have that razor edge of thundering power that used to make my hair stand on end and stir my heart ;-(
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Wow. There are few words to describe the brilliance of this album. Avril's Under My Skin really shows her maturity, both in her singing and in her songwriting. Her debut album, Let Go was excellent, but Under My Skin greatly surpasses it. Avril's songs are much deeper, more personal, and have so much more meaning behind the words. Many of them touched me deeply, including &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, a song devoted to her grandfather, and &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; which actually brought me to tears, as I can really relate her words in the song. <br />All of the songs on this album are truly wonderful; I like every single one of them. I am so happy that she hasn't fallen into the dreaded &quot;sophomore slump&quot;, as so many artists do. Instead, Avril has proven her undeniable talent on this record. Those who liked Let Go will love this album, and I believe that those who didn't should give Under My Skin a chance, and they will find that it is most definitely an album worth buying. <br />My new favorite CD!
1563894696|3.0|Here's another offering from the kings of retro, Jeph Loeb (writer) and Tim Sale (artist), reexamining Batman during his mythical \\"Year One\\" period. If you believe the intro to this volume, this story was meant to be a sequel to Frank Miller's classic retelling of the Dark Knight's early days in \\"Batman: Year One\\" (1986/7). As a story, this work is pretty weak in many areas; as a sequel, is simply falls short of the tight, mature storytelling of Frank Miller's original.<br />The story centers on the Roman family (originally introduced in \\"Batman: Year One\\"), a serial killer who offs people in creative ways during holiday seasons and the trio out to stop the crimes - Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. Tim Sale is especially suitable for a work like this - his moody, atmospheric and splash-pages art are truly a sight to behold. You feel yourself being sucked into Batman's Gotham. My primary complaint is with Jeph Loeb's writing. Like my previous review of \\"Superman for All Seasons\\", my views of the man's writing hasn't changed. I like HOW he writes - I just dislike WHAT he writes! He's a great scripter, providing witty, timely and simply apt dialogues and caption boxes that the whole thing read very smoothly even though it runs into 300+ pages. The problem is with his insipid plotting. He should have someone else plot his tales and script over them. For example, in order to maintain the novelty of \\"holiday-themed killings\\", the story is stretched across THIRTEEN months and countless murders - and finally Batman catches the killer (but we are told that he got the wrong guy). And this is the \\"World's Greatest Detective\\"? Meanwhile, Batman consults a Hannibal-Lecter-like Calendar Man who is incapacitated in prison but seemingly knows the identity of the killer (?!?). See the problem? Batman, Gordon and Harvey are supposedly super-cops and they run around like madmen without a clue to the killer and you have this locked-up guy knowing the truth behind everything? Granted, Loeb was trying to set up a \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" scene with Calendar Man but therein lies the weakness of the whole thing. It is a scene set up for its own sake and doesn't contribute anything to the STORY. We live in times wherein comic writers are a lot more influenced by TV and movies than literature. And Loeb, former screenwriter, epitomize this new breed of writers who set up cool scenes, writes clever dialogue, provides the atmosphere with the right artistic collaboration but ultimately delivers something very hollow and shallow. \\"The Long Halloween\\" is often compared to the pulp classics of Chandler and Hammett. I disagree vehemently. Loeb and Sale gave us \\"mood\\" and \\"cool scenes\\" but ultimately the story is without gusto, the characters lack the machismo and grit of true noirish anti-heroes, and though the atmosphere is there, it lacks the tight, all-encompassing claustrophobia of the great noirish works. <br />The only redeeming factor in this work is the retelling of Two-Face's origin. Loeb is especially great in the quiet \\"character\\" moments and here, the tragic story of Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face is beautifully retold. But Loeb's strength is often his most-glaring fault at the same time. For example the book begins with a full-page drawing of a grim-looking Bruce Wayne muttering, \\"I believe in Gotham City\\" - a scene I found to be laughably out-of-character for the flamboyant playboy persona of Bruce Wayne! This kinds of out-of-character scenes abound throughout the story. All in all, this story should have been better written by a more gritty writer like Greg Rucka or Ed Brubaker (both of them have written far better Batman stories than Loeb here).
B0000517BU|5.0|Archangels Thunderbird is one of the most rocking and thunderous songs of the whole prog/kraut rock lexion of the 70's. Amon Duul II came as a very welcome surprise one day shopping for records at Peaches in Atlanta in 1972, as picked this and Tanz der Lemmings at the same time based solely on the album covers. Both albums turned out to be loadstones of information for the music that came out of England et al with Hawkwind, Yes, King Crimson, Atomic Rooster, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Nice, Gentle Giant, Can, Faust, Gong, Frank Zappa, Flash, Captain Beefheart, Captain Beyond, Bonzo Dog Band, and who else? What of Prog Rock without Amon Duul II? It would not have the fever of unbridled exploration and invention without Yeti and Danz der Lemmings. These two releases went where no British or American band dare go before them, and for some time, after them. Yeti is one of those essential albums not only for it's historical importance, but also for the way the music has relevance even today. Ten years passed I did not listen to them and then one day I picked up the UA years CD and from there I had to repurchase my favorites on remastered CD. I am forever thankful. <BR>Amon Duul II is the most fearless of them all. Their music does at times meander, but it does so with unity and purpose and that purpose is the integrity of the music itself.<BR>They rock, and they touch space, and that is what made them great.
B0001GL3K4|3.0|The only reason I give this three stars is that Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, and Emma Thompson gave such great performances. If the film had focused only on their three stories and as a result allowed them to develop more fully, it would have been a great film. I saw absolutely no point in the story line of the aging pop star, the idiot Colin who goes to America looking for sex (and, amazingly, FINDS it! If he had found a sweet Wisconsin girl who fell in love with him, that would have been OK, but as it was, it was beyond disgusting), or the couple who meet apparently while working as stand-ins for porn stars. Way too many characters. Keira Knightly, Laura Linney, and Hugh Grant have mildly interesting story lines, but only because you like the actors. And frankly, I don't even understand why the filmmakers bothered paying Rowan Atkinson for the annoying little bit part he had.<br />As for the \\"America bashing,\\" we do that plenty here in the U.S., thank you, so why should we complain that the Brits do it? A bit hypocritical if you ask me. Let them bash away--it's their prerogative, and it has nothing to do with the quality (or lack thereof in this case) of this movie.<br />There were so many story lines that I may have actually missed a couple of them here--it was too much to take on in one film, and it wasn't a success. Still, it's worth the rental for the performances of Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Colin Firth--and especially the little boy who played Liam Neeson's stepson.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Anyone who claims she is &quot;punk&quot; has no idea what they are talking about. Darby Crash &amp; the Germs would kick this little poseur's behind into the middle of next week...and then go out for a beer.<br />She wants to be the female Sid Vicious, but comes across more like Sid Caesar!
B0000524CY|5.0|While she is nothing short of excellent in this hit film does anyone agree she curiously turns in a better performance after becoming posessed then before.
B00000JGHM|5.0|A truly amazing film, and too good to ruin by writing a novel sized review. Cast: Among the best ever assembled. Action: Riveting all the way through the three hour movie. Plot: Cop vs Robber, but it is much more then that. The Bank Scene: One of the best action sequences in movie history. The Action: Raw and bloody, De Niro is calculating, fierce and committed, along side his nemesis and tireless rival Al Pacino. Conclusion: You won't know who you'll want to win or who you'll want to lose, brilliant and complex characters played by Oscar winners, what more can you ask for.
B0000AUHPK|4.0|The English Patient costars Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche star in this brilliant adaptation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. <br />Having just recently read and enjoyed the book, I had a look at this on the weekend. It's very well done. Wonderful cinematography, great acting by Fienne's as Heathcliff has a haunting music score and moves along very nicely. Unfortunately the copy I got was only pan and scan but this one is in widescreen which would look really good.<br />I'd recommend reading the book first so you have something to compare it to. Considering all the rubbish coming out these days, I'd rather watch Wuthering Heights anytime.<br />Thanks for reading.
B000050X31|5.0|People say Magic Flute is a serious opera. In a sense, it is. Nonetheless, it is so much fun watching this opera. It's a complete delight that suits audience of all ages regardless of their background. This is in fact a very good place to start with either opera or Mozart or both at the same time. Why? <br />It's excellent in terms of singing, acting, support from the orchestra and photography. The photography is of the highest quality. Costumes are as imaginative and effective, the settings are artistic and evocative as could be. <br />The jewel of the crown is of course the Queen of the Night and her two arias. Such a voice and such technique that rendered the arias so intriquing, that I went back to them three times already. Papageno's and Pamina's part (her voice mixes so well with her counterparts) are great. All the singers/actors including their costumes and the props are so pleasing to the eyes. The rhythm goes fast and is never boring at all. Needless to say,  Levine the conductor is marvelous too. <br />If there is anything to say against the play,  it is the hoisting of the three little singing boys halfway up in the midst of the clouds, so to speak, which made them rather uptight. But that is a very small point indeed. The perfomance well deserves 5 stars whichever way your look at it.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I love Interveiw with the Vampire!  Brad Pitt and TOm Cruise are great in it, and so is kirsten Dunst.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i am a big avril lavigne fan she is a real female musician not like alot of the fake wanna be's out there today like a certain miss britany spears and countless others. Avril can write, sing and play guitar she does it all and she does it well. I have alway found female rock stars [attractive] and avril is no exception under those clothes is a very [attractive] body of a [attractive] woman. I think this new album is very good i don't think any avril fan will regret purchasing it. there are not enough real female musicians today so please support avril who is one and purchase this great album. don't waste your money on that other teeny bop [garbage] and you all know who i'm talking about there's alot of them. i also think avril has matured with her song writing on this album i hope she just keeps getting better and better with each album. Women with talent are so [attractive] and avril has talent. Bottom line buy this great album highly recommended by this music lover.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|i don't have this album and i will never buy it, but i've heard the single enough times to want inflict bodily harm upon myself.  so instead of doing that, i will write this.  this music is terrible, overhyped, overproduced, lacking in creativity and intelligence.  but what do you expect from a 19 year old who actually said in an interview that she was &quot;deep&quot;.  seems to me if your so deep, then why do you have to tell everyone?  <br />my suggestion - if you or someone you know owns this album, you need to immediately hunt them down and beat them unmercifully with a bag of bread.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Ok, this album really proved she IS a writer, and a dang good one too.....<br />She really put more depth into her songs and is maturing and growing in her music very well.
0486424510|5.0|MoonStone absolutley has you on edge.  It's unlike most books, instead of having a slow begining where they introduce all the cahracters, it goes straight to the plot.  It's a tornado of emotion, but one that's easy to follow.  The book enables you to feel the danger of death (over a misfit yellow diamond) around every corner. The plot never dies, it's impossible to put the book down once you start. It easily wins over your mind.  You'll probably end up reading the same page twice just to get that complete feeling.  It takes you back to the times of Victorian Ladies and Gentlemens.  The book takes you away from your current life, and lets you enter into a totally new one.  5 stars easily earned
0553382179|5.0|My only complaint about this book is that I wish it addresssed more about how to incorporate your business obligations/schedule into the Flylady system.  Also-more about office and desk organization.<br />It's a fabulous book.  I just want more!
B00005KB9T|5.0|In The Wailers' &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; and &quot;Burnin'&quot; (both released in the same year, 1973), the group released two instant classics that they never surpassed in terms of artistry, musicianship, rhythm foundation or edginess. And these two albums were also the last two that the original Wailing Wailers (Marley, Tosh, Bunny) made together. <BR>A blend of new and old (such familiar tracks as &quot;Concrete Jungle,&quot; &quot;Slave Driver,&quot; &quot;400 Years,&quot; &quot;Stop that Train&quot; from &quot;Catch A Fire,&quot; and &quot;Put It On,&quot; &quot;Small Axe&quot; and &quot;Duppy Conqueror&quot; from &quot;Burnin'&quot; were remakes), these albums were the Wailers first releases with the intent to reach an international, mainstream audience. Blending in some rock influences such as the guitar style, and toning down the bass and drum for more treble sounds to reach the rock audiences in Europe and America, the Wailers debut on Island label snuck up slowly on these listeners, just as the intro to &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; slowly rolls in, opening the &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; album. There may be some lesser, lighter moments on both albums, but no songs are throwaway, no songs are filler. <BR>Sadly, despite being full of gems and instant Wailers classics, original members Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer left to start solo careers, feeling they were in the shadow of Bob, and had their own stories to tell musically. It was more unfortunate, because Bob Marley and the Wailers (as the group became known) never surpassed the quality of these albums on later efforts. With Tosh's departure went the edgy, bassy rhythm sounds, and with both Bunny and Tosh went the delectable harmonies they provided behind Bob's lead vocals. If there are only two albums in the Wailers library of music, they go by the names &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; and &quot;Burnin'.&quot; They both had a stark, unadulterated emotion and edge that Bob Marley's more pop-influenced efforts lack. With the departures of Tosh and Bunny, it felt as if a light was being extinguished. But listening to these albums again, makes me remember back to a time, when the childhood friends were like brothers, making music together until the sun came up. Listening to these albums is bittersweet, but I can still relive those times listening to the sweet, harmonious music they made together, as family, reminiscing to a time when something truly mystical, magical was happening in the studio. But with the breakup of the original Wailing Wailers, the circle was broken, the fire doused, and what once was one, was splintered into three, to never join back together again. &quot;In the ghetto, bitter was sweet.....&quot;
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I must say that I am amazed by the quality of this cd.  It definently is a step up for Avril.  Under My Skin compared to Let Go has improved lyrically and musically...even vocally.  There's even some piano on there, and it doesn't sound out of place...it's really something and i really enjoy this cd...here's my views on each song...<br />1) Take Me Away: This one is a great introduction to this awesome cd. You get to hear a new sound from Avril.  The short little \\"scream\\" that transitions you from the verses to the chorus sends chills down your spine. The chorus is addicting and can get stuck in your head.  The climax or middle of the song, whatever you want to call it is pretty cool. <BR>Rating: 8/10<br />2) Together: There's that piano I was talking about. Nice little opening there...This song also hold a new sound within it. It's kind of remincent of Blink182 when she's singing this song...well...they are both canadian, still it sounds really good. I adore the chorus and the opening before it..and the guitars are awesome!<BR>Rating: 9/10<br />3) Don't Tell Me:  Everyone has probably heard this radio hit. So I'm not going to give much of an opinion on this, since most have already formed one ;)...this song is fun to listen to and has an interesting introduction.<BR>Rating: 8/10<br />4) He Wasn't: This song is a fun \\"bouncy\\" song. The chorus is catchy and the \\"Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey\\" is cool and the \\"Na Na, Na na Na\\" is a \\"new feature\\" introduced on this cd.<BR>Rating: 7/10<br />5) How Does It Feel: The first \\"slow song\\" shown on the cd. It has a nice intro. just her voice and no instruments, nice...This song is very relaxing and the lyrics aren't half bad ; ) It has some nice strings in the background sometimes and the guitars are good too. The climax is amazing...it's a good song : )<BR>Rating: 9/10<br />6) My Happy Ending: This is her second single, which will be released pretty soon...not sure on the date though ; ) This song is really really good (for lack of better words heh heh) The chorus truly IS addicting and it just get's stuck in your head FOREVER! lol...This is one my fav. on the album.<BR>Rating: 10/10<br />7) Nobody's Home: There are no words to explain how much i love this song!! It's not only the lyrics that grab you, it's the music and how she sings the song that pull you in.  The music was produced by Ben Moody (used to be with Evanescence) and by Avril herself...she also wrote the lyrics for this song..as well as all the others...but this is one of the songs she wrote all herself..The tune is really addicting and the chorus is the best part ; )<BR>Rating: 10/10<br />8) Forgotten: Another piano opening, it has a haunting/mysterious feeling to it...this song is a cool rock song. The guitars are nice, and it can get stuck in you're head sometimes..the climax is pretty cool too....\\"There's no point thinking aboot yesterday\\" heh heh..i love her accent...<BR>Rating:8/10<br />9) Who Knows: This song is another upbeat fun song to listen too and has some good lyrics. I always enjoy listening to this one, it's pretty addicting and catchy and the middle of the song, with the clapping is pretty cool : )<BR>Rating: 8/10<br />10) Fall To Pieces: This is also a kind of upbeat song, it doesn't stand out much by itself but it's a nice addition to the album, still enjoyable.<BR>Rating: 7/10<br />11)Freak Out: This one has a cool opening with the guitars and such...this is, heh heh, once again an \\"upbeat\\" type of song..which i have nothing wrong, i like upbeat too ; ) <BR>This song is one of the best of the few upbeat songs on this album i'd say the second or..tied with another as the first best upbeat..anyway..the chorus is fun/cool and the middle is addicting..it's my fav. part, i luv it :P<BR>Rating: 8/10<br />12) Slipped Away: This is the third one of the three \\"slow songs\\" on the album. This one was dedicated to her grandfather so it's got some nice feeling put into it. I really enjoy listening to this one. It has a nice piano opening and has Avril humming which sounds kind of haunting, nice. And i love when she goes \\"Na na...na na na Na na...\\" it's great and the middle of the song is really good too...you get a mix of her canadian accent in there, which is cool...i love it! : ) this is one of my fav. songs she's ever done. I truly admire this one and it's a great conclusion to Avril's second album...<BR>Rating: 10/10<br />I'm definently looking forward to the third...until then i'm going to keep this cd on repeat like it has been for almost a week now ;P ...hopefully this review has assisted you in making a decision on whether or not to buy this album...Of course i say buy it, it's worth the money : ).
B0001GL3K4|2.0|This movie does exactly what it says on the tin. It's sugary, uncomplicated fluf, but never pretends to be anything else.  As for the reviewer complaining about what he calls 'U.S' bashing - first of all this is a British movie reflecting a non U.S opinion, which makes a change from the patronising pro-US/Land of the free/God bless America tripe that Hollywood seems determined to force down everyone's throats at every turn. <BR>At the end of the day, this is an average Christmas feel good movie.

B00005JMEW|3.0|Kill Bill, Vol. 1, at its heart, is really a simple tale of a wanna-be murder gone wrong and the revenge that courses through the intended victim. However, in Quentin Tarantino's hands, Kill Bill is an overblown blood fest.<br />Uma Thurman plays \\"The Bride,\\" who is also known as \\"Black Mambo.\\" She was a part of an elite killing squad with 4 other adept assassins played by Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and Lucy Liu. These five killers are headed up by Bill, whose face we never see in the movie. For some unexplained reason, Bill and his four killers set out to murder a very pregnant Black Mambo on her wedding day. They torture and kill Black Mambo and her unborn child...so they think. Black Mambo/The Bride awakens from a four year coma with revenge killing on her mind.<br />The movie switches back from the distant past, to the recent past, and to the present at lightening speed without making much of a cohesive plot. The flick is filled with Quentin Tarantino -esque pop culture references and psuedo-philosophical speeches from his characters. The only thing lacking in the dialogue is his normal excessive usage of the word n***ger.<br />Kill Bill, Vol. 1, is an ostentatious homage to the 1950s Japanese samurai, the 1970s kung fu, and the late 80s/early 90s Hong Kong action movies. I even suspect that Lucy Liu's character's name, O-Ren Ishii is a homage to the rap group N.W.A. (O standing for the first letter in Ice Cube's real name, Oshay. Ren for the deejay of N.W.A., and \\"ishi\\" sounds a lot like \\"Eazy-E.\\") I give the movie three stars out of five for the plot twist at the end, the excellent swordplay, and the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA's spot-on original scores.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I always hoped Madonna's voice would get better and better as the years went on, but she seems to be struggling throughout American Life. She doesn't have a real sense of conviction for the music. She was never a great singer, but the music always seemed to overshadow her limited vocal abliilities. This time there are two strikes agianst her. Her voice is still weak, but so is the music. Better luck next time.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Maiden, please bring Martin Birch back and fire Kevin Shirley. That's the only way that maybe someone will have the courage to get close to Steve Harris and say &quot;Hey pal, you don't need to turn songs that otherwise would be great into boring songs by repeating their chorus one hundred times!! You did not do that in the good old days!&quot;<br />That's it. This album had the potentital to be something special, but producion almost ruined it. It's compressed, really strange.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off, I think the purpose of metal is to remove the sick antics and brutal corporate poundings of plastic artists such as: Britney Smears, Christina Aglacaca, or whatever their record company wants to call them. Metal is metal and its one of the most purest of music out there. I chose metal as my music, because of the fact that it reaches down to the root of every emotional nerve. It moves you the way no other music can. The sound of the guitar, the pounding drums, all of it. But lyrically, I think no other music is capable of capturing that spirit of humanity. Black Sabbath, Pantera, Slayer, Metallica, Korn, etc. The so-called label of nu-metal is what separates the glory and power of metal. Don't be so negative about the way metal musicians develop these days. Reading these reviews, only heightens the belief and deconstructive plans of the musical mainstream of POP music. (To me, anyway.) No matter how microscopic we get into each bands delivery, we should not forget the overall status of the METAL genre itself. Stand up and raise your chalises to the sound of METAL, don't sit and ponder or conjure up another reason for the corporate wolves to demean and criticize METAL. Someday, it might not be there. And our emotions and lives will be represented by the likes of the new Hanson album or John Mayer. Slipknot can still walk across America and beyond, with a heavy hammer and destroy. They are at the top along with all our brothers in metal. Metal never tries to put itself on a pedestal. It waits eagerly with us in the pit and in the crowd to overcome the plastic and glass and shatter and tear through the constant barrage of POP music. So grab ahold of the sledge and show the world the might and power of metal. Or you can dance? You can whistle and hum along to that nifty new CD by another American Idol. <br />Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses...now we know why they used this title. The &quot;Duality&quot; of their audience...is that a question? We certainly seemto be hearing alot of answers. How well do we know METAL. Are we that brainwashed to just let our souls attain the fury of just being human? Take it all in. All at once. Otherwise......oops....she'll do it again!<br />This CD is brilliant. I recommend it to any true metalhead out there. Doesn't matter where you buy it. Just get it. Can you imagine the sound of 200,000 people in a crowd, shouting as one. Or are you that one person whispering the echo of Tipper Gore.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|(...)It stays at that level of interest for the entire movie. <br />The Plot: Two people go to Tokyo without really wanting to - one for a pile of money and the other because she is married. They feel sorry for themselves and each other. Rather than make the best of a bad situation while stranded in one of the largest cities in the world, they mire in a 'poor us' mentality for two hours in places that could be located anywhere else in the world. Despite the title, there is very little interaction with the Japanese. Its just two hours of the same two people.<br />I don't just watch action movies. I like the occasional quiet movie with depth of character; however character driven movies generally show some kind of transformation of character - neither of these people changed - I suspect they both went home and continued to be unhappy because it was easy.<br />The movie gets 2 stars for pretty good cinematography - I enjoyed seeing some of the sights and sounds of Japan when camera wandered (all too briefly).

B00005NOOH|5.0|Made at a time when War time emotions still affected the commentary - never the less - the stills and motion pictures themselves don't lie.  So until a Ken Burns comes along and re does this with lots of facts - we won't be able to do better.  In other words - this is worth looking at - just for the images - but take the commentary with a grain of salt.
B00005QDW5|1.0|* (if possible, 1/2 a star)<br />OK - surprise, surprise - I've never been a Pink Floyd fan, and never will be.  <br />Thru the years I've had a couple of PF albums (dis)grace my collection (&quot;Dark Side&quot; + &quot;Collection of Great Dance Songs&quot; or something) but I've always just thrown my arms up in quiet but outraged desperation whenever, unafazed, I've faced the music.  <br />Nonetheless, seeing since it's supposedly a &quot;Best Of&quot;, I REALLY TRIED to listen to this pile of crap with an open mind, but my time and effort was in vain.  I will never like this sort of music which takes itself too seriously for its own good.  As a result it just becomes silly ... in the very same way as Vanilla Ice was.  It's just POP music, for chrissakes!  Although that maybe too good of a word to describe this boring old lot.  But one look at one of those horrendously pretentious sleeve designs and I'm gone.  &quot;Delicate Sound Of Thunder&quot; is always guaranteed a good and hearty laugh in my house.  So at least that's something. <br />As for the music itself, there isn't much here to warm up to.  Early single &quot;See Emily Play&quot; isn't half bad, and deems Bowie's 1973 cover of it totally inferior and unworthy.  &quot;Money&quot; - a 'Classic Rock' radio staple, I kid you not - proves once more that familiarity breeds contempt.  Horrible.  &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, their big - yes, read it and weep - D-I-S-C-O smash, further proves that point.  Dreadful.<br />Prog Rock at its worst.  Come back EL&amp;P, all is forgiven!
B00005QAPH|4.0|For what it is---an intensely personal statement about Fellini's own frustrations at a film director at a certain point in his life, as reflected by the frustrations of his film director alter ego Guido Anselmi---Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is indeed brilliant and creative. It is certainly not like any other film you've ever seen, and it deserves to be seen by any serious cinema enthusiast at least once or twice, since it is such an influential film.<br />That being said, I have to admit that, after having seen it twice, I personally still can only express a cold admiration for Fellini's achievements here. I just can never really get myself personally involved in Fellini's world here to the point that I truly care about Guido and his predicament. Fellini hardly bothers to build up any sympathy for Guido or any of the characters (although I personally did feel some sympathy for Guido's wife Luisa, who is convincingly portrayed by Anouk Aimee as a woman who has had enough of his husband director's cheating ways). The film is on such a personal level that Fellini shuts the audience out and makes us view his universe from afar without truly enveloping us in it, and while what he does in that universe is undeniably brilliant, it means precious little to us in the end. I am almost tempted to echo some of the sentiments of critics (like Pauline Kael) who were less than enthusiastic when the film was first released in America---those who dismissed the film as &quot;self-indulgent trivia.&quot; I expected a film about filmmaking, and what I saw instead was the story of a director going on and on and on about his own suffering, and frankly sometimes I just didn't truly care.<br />But then, of course, maybe Fellini never intended to fully engage the audience in this film. Or maybe I just have to watch more Fellini films in order to perhaps get onto his wavelength (so far, 8 1/2 is the only film of Fellini's I have seen). Despite my personal misgivings, 8 1/2 does have some justlyfamous sequences and images(the harem sequence being the standout), and is interesting enough to warrant a look by any serious film enthusiast. Who knows? Great art sometimes doesn't reveal its depths the first time, and maybe this film will eventually reveal something more in subsequent viewings (although in the back of my mind I have my doubts).
B000088E6D|5.0|I just discovered Michael Buble, and I am certainly glad I did. He has picked some kick-ass classics, and he does them all so well. We'll be hearing a lot more from this guy in the future. Give it a listen, it's well-worth it!
B00005K3LW|3.0|John McTiernan returned to direct this second follow-up to McTiernan's original DIE HARD from 1988, but unfortunately all his considerable skill and energy can't rise above screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh's generic script. DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE could easily have been LETHAL WEAPON 4 (maybe it almost was), and the script does little to make it stand out from other buddy action-movies (although Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson undoubtedly do work well together). As for the action scenes, they're certainly well-executed, but there's just no real momentum connecting the action scenes the way there was in the second half of DIE HARD 2. In VENGEANCE, there's just one action scene piled upon another, and the whole thing simply feels like an incoherent mess, which certainly was not the case in the first two films of the series.<br />DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE will certainly entertain action fans, since the action scenes are undeniably creative and well-mounted. Compare VENGEANCE to the first two DIE HARDs, though, and there's no contest. DIE HARD will forever be an action classic, and DIE HARD 2 was a generally worthy sequel. In that company, DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE is merely average.

B0000AMRJC|3.0|After watching the documentary on this 20th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of Brian De Palma's SCARFACE detailing how this movie has been an influence on gangsta rappers, I could certainly understand why this movie has become a gangster film classic. It certainly has a memorable main character, Tony Montana, masterfully played by the ever-so-versatile Al Pacino. Montana is a magnetic but deeply flawed individual who gets lucky, gets rich, and then gets greedy (which destroys him), and Pacino does a good job in bringing out the man's magnetism without making us truly like him exactly. And on a technical level it is well-made, with bright, colorful cinematography by John Alonzo to accentuate the '80s flash (and perhaps its lack of substance).<br />And yet after the final gun battle was over and Tony Montana had received his deadly comeuppance, the overall impression I got out of SCARFACE was of a generally unremarkable, overlong action movie with some heavy-handed, unsubtle drama beneath. I guess I just didn't buy the bloated operatic style De Palma employed in this film, and as usual with some of his speeches, screenwriter Oliver Stone has the subtlety of a sledgehammer (sometimes it works, but sometimes it makes you wince, like it does here). &quot;Nothing exceeds like excess,&quot; says Michelle Pfeiffer's character Elvira in the movie, and De Palma seems to have followed that in SCARFACE---to the film's detriment, I think. THE GODFATHER and GOODFELLAS are undoubtedly still your best bet if you are looking for great gangster movies. SCARFACE seems distinctly second-rate in that company, despite Pacino's notable performance (and I didn't mind his Cuban accent at all).

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Although I have not been a fan of Schwartz's work in the past, I could not keep myself from picking up Wicked because the book was wonderful and I adore Kristen Chenoweth.  She has such an amazing voice.  Once I listened to Wicked, I had a new respect for Stephen Schwartz.  As usual, the music is very &quot;now&quot; and has a lot of pop to it.  The major highlights are Idina Menzel's &quot;The Wizard and I&quot;  witch is unbelievable, especially at the key change; Kristen Chenoweth's comic turn on &quot;Popular&quot;; the thunderously amazing &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;; Joel Gray's big number &quot;Wonderful&quot;; and the touching &quot;For Good&quot;.  Besides the leading ladies, Michelle Federer has a lovely little part of &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot; and Norbert Leo Butts does and excellent job on &quot;As Long As You're Mine.&quot;  Also, Menzel brings out both the good and bad sides of her Wicked Witch in the beautiful &quot;I'm Not That Girl&quot; and the soaring &quot;No Good Deed&quot;.  This is a must have for any musical lover's collection.  A Wicked Good Show!!!!!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I consider this movie a breakthrough. It is the first I've seen that equals - or passes - good live-action movies for subtle development and interaction of characters.<br />It took the first 30-45 minutes to get going, but that time was used to establish the characters and the setting. Be patient - it's worth the wait. After that, the movie is really about families. I don't mean the &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; kind, with Mom, Dad, and their children by each other. I mean the real families these days, where the ideas of Mom and Dad need to flex and where the children are unrelated to one or both. I mean a real family with real problems, holding together because everyone is struggling to hold it together.<br />The animation is good and the character animation are very good, but excellence is the norm these days. The plot and story are what make this movie stand out. As an aside, I was interested to hear a few English words adopted into the Japanese idiom, &quot;homeless&quot; and &quot;godfather&quot; being the most obvious. I was also interested to see that the Spanish speech wasn't subtitled - English speakers will need to puzzle it through, same as the Japanese listeners did.<br />This isn't an &quot;adult&quot; movie, but there's not a lot here for kids. That's fine. Kids have their own movies, and we need ours.
B00005JLYW|2.0|Angels I at least had a little (maybe very little) originality going for it. This is just over-the-top, over-acted, over-wired silliness. Maybe it's OK for a tween-age boy, but the rest of us deserve better.<br />Demi Moore is the one exception. She still looks good in a bikini, even without the natural advantage of being twenty-something. She snarls her way through her role with just the right campiness. Even so, she's not enough to salvage this one.<br />There are better movies out there. Go find one.

Would you sit back in your heaven, not question anything, and never think of life again?  Of course not!  Neither does Susie Salmon.  Alice Sebold, the author, captures her emotions perfectly.  <BR>      In this haunting, powerful story, you get the feeling that you could be in the story itself.  You become completely enveloped in the emotions that run haywire, the spirits, the murder, and the thought of a true afterlife. <BR>     This book is completely awesome!  I didn't want to put it down the entire time I was reading it.  I would reccomend this book to anyone.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've liked 'Knot since their self-titled... so don't thinik I know about the older 'Knot. But, I will venture as far as to say that this is the best CD Slipknot has done. It has the same, warm, familiar 'Knot for some of the Maggots who don't know better, and it has Corey's haunting vocals on many of the tracks to show that they are not just a Cradle of Filth type band... monotonus. What many of the bad reviewers don't understand is that you can still be intense through actual singing rather than just screaming and screaming. As much as I loved the old 'Knot, I'm glad to see they have evolved a bit.

B0001NBMBC|1.0|Seriously if anyone likes this album they should listen to slipknots other albums and then ask them selves, ?who are these imposters and what happened to slipknot??.<BR>Ok maybe if this CD was done by a different band then I might consider giving it a little better review but its by slipknot and its really bad. Like what?s with those acoustic tracks, I thought slipknot was a heavy metal band? Could you imagine going to go see them and there are these 8 or 9 guys with all these ?scary masks? on singing this acoustic song? I my self wouldn?t pay to see that.<br />Slipknot what were you thinking when you made this CD, if you wanted to show how Corey can sing (which he can?t) let him be in Stone Sour. I can?t believe how bad this CD really is, I don?t know about anyone else but I was expecting some really heavy stuff from the guys.<br />If you listen to the track called ?Welcome? you will see that it is one of the ?heavier? tracks on the CD, then go listen to songs such as ?New Abortion? and ?Liberate? and you just think seriously what has happened to them. They were this brutal metal band  and then just went totally soft.<br />I think that if they really wanted this album to do well on the charts they should of lost the masks and changed their name so something a little more appropriate.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'm kind of shocked at the level of disgust this film was afforded by almost half of its reviewers here on Amazon. (For those who thought THIS was difficult, try watching a John Cassavetes film like \\"Husbands\\" and you'll have a heart attack!) But what I really don't understand about the bulk of the negative reviews is this constant refrain that the movie was \\"pretentious\\" or \\"intellectual\\". For me, I felt that a lot of the ambiguities placed in the film were completely emotional rather than intellectual. The deepest thing going on here is a growing attraction between a very improbable couple. It's the impossibility of their situation that makes this so innocent and fresh. I thought this was one of the sweetest and most genuine romance stories I've seen in a film (and I love Tracy and Hepburn too!).     It succeeds because it so perfectly emulates the yearning and awkwardness of what it feels like to have a crush on someone. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play this beautifully. Murray brings his usual charming quick wit along but, at other times, he is remarkably unguarded (watch him mouth the chorus to Johansson as she sings Karaoke). The rest of the cast is also wonderful; from Charlotte's loopy, clueless husband to the ditzy, self absorbed, Hollywood actress they meet at the hotel (her dialogue is priceless!), to the achingly tacky lounge singer. The Japanese cast is also great, particularly the whiskey commercial directors trying to communicate their artistic vision to a completely dumbstruck Bill Murray.      What's sad to me about these negative reviews is how mistrustful and resistant (and downright resentful) we've become to anything that doesn't feel comfortably familiar. For those who wrote that a film should be entertaining first, I completely disagree! That's comfort food not art (and I'm not talking about experimental art-films which this is NOT), I'm talking about making anything that challenges the viewer to maybe see the world differently for a few minutes or maybe doesn't spell everything out for them. This film is not that difficult to follow, it's just quieter and less manipulative than most. I don't think it was Coppola's intention to make a \\"feel-good\\" romantic comedy but, if that's what you're looking for, there's always \\"The Prince & Me\\" and good luck with that...
0452282152|4.0|In my experience, sometimes historical fiction can be extremely tedious. In this case, it's absolutely amazing. I was never really interested in art, or the Netherlands, until I read this book. I had never heard of Johannes Vermeer, but this story gives you some insight into what he could have been like.It is a wonderful story but it has an air of mystery and illusion that can be confusing.Itis is the tale of a simple girl named Griet who becomes a maid in the painter Vermeer's home. The cook hates her for being a more thorough maid than she; Vermeer's wife Catharina is jealous of a maid being allowed into her husband's studio; Maria Thins, the painter's mother, is a shrewd bussinesswoman and always watching Griet wherever she goes. It is in this hostile enviornment that she begins to bond with her master,  eventually becoming his assistant as her subtle changes help him finish his work.<BR> This story is a picture in itself, a portrait of varying emotions: elation, as Griet discovers what it means to be a true artist; lust, as painter and muse create a bond that may exist outside of the art they create; and degrees of simmering jealousy as those outside the studio become angry with Griet for entering a place they are not allowed to go and can never seem to reach. The strange thing about the main character is that despite all of the emotion swirling around her, she retains an air of calm, as if such things are expected in the life of a maid.  Even though the story is narrated in first person,her attitude makes me wonder who she really is and what she's really thinking of the odd events in her life.
0316666343|1.0|I chose this book because I had never read another like it. I was intrigued by the idea of a dead girl \\"spying\\" on her family and how that family dealt with her loss. The story was ok in the begining. By page 100, it lost me. The 14 yr old girl does not speak like a teenager. Her sister Lindsey is incredibly strong emtionally for someone who lost her sister. The mother doesn't ever break down. She cheats on her husband and leaves the family. I find all of this and many other points hard to believe. The biggest problem I have with the book is the police. How dumb are they? Everyone in the town knows about a sink hole where people dump their garbage, yet the police never searched it? Lindsey is 13 yrs old. Her sister has been killed. She and her father suspect the neighbor so she breaks into his home. Wouldn't she be terrified? I sure would have at that age. Why would a mother cheat on her husband and leave her young son? Why didn't she just suggest that they all move to another town? I liked the idea that Susan was watching her friends to see how they'd get on without her, but I didn't believe it. She didn't seem to know Ray very well. They had a crush on each other and shared one kiss, yet she seemed to obsess over him and Ruth when Carissa was actually her friend. It doesn't make sense. I didn't feel like I knew Susan or cared about her or the rest of the people. The only people I felt like I knew was the father. I have to admit that I stopped reading the book around the 100 page mark and only skimmed the pages until the end. Did I get this right? Lindsey somehow got into Ruth's body and had sex with Ray? Give me a freaking break. She finally gets the chance to be on earth and speak to people again and the first thing she does is have sex with a boy she barely knew. That is disgusting. Why didn't she speak to her family and let them know that the neigbor did it and that she was ok? And no one finds the evidence and the guy isn't caught by the end of the book. Thatstinks! Sorry, but this book was truly awful and not satisfying at all. I am so glad I only took it out from the library. If I had bought the book, I'd send a letter to the author and demand my money back. I will not be reading anymore of her amaturish, immature books.
B000002I25|3.0|This is a good album, but I disagree with reviewers who claim this is The Doors' best.<br />It certainly doesn't compete with &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; and &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot;.
078401213X|5.0|This movie challenges religion and society in a way that would be appalling anywhere else. Somehow, in this movie, one hardly notices. It wraps the viewer into insanity, turns them into the protagonist in unprecedented ways.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I have actually liked all of Richard Curtis' movies.  This one though has been my favorite.  This movie offers several different story lines with some of today's most talented actors.<br />Colin Firth finds love with a girl that dosen't understand English, and he can't speak Portuguese but that doesn't stand in their way.  Hugh Grant is the PM of England and finds love with one of his members of household.  Can a PM find love at Christmas time?  Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are a married couple that is truly tested by a possible affaire.  Laura Linney finds love with a co-worker but has family responsiblities that play a large part in whether the relationship will work.  Liam Neeson is a stepfather that finds himself helping his stepson who is experiencing love for the very first time.<br />This is a very heartwarming movie demonstrating that love can be found anywhere, at anytime, for anyone!  This movie will make you laugh and cry, and truly believe in love!

B0001NBMBC|4.0|Having been a loyal fan of the band since the begining, it was dissapointing to have read a bunch of reviews from people saying that Slipknot had gone soft. <BR>Now having sat down and listened to the album, yes, I will admit this album wasn't as brutal or aggresively raw as 'Slipknot' and 'Iowa', but by no means is this album crap. In contrast, most heavier bands around now and days are evolving to a softer more meaningful type of music. The Slipknot boys are no different! These songs have more meaning and emotion than ever before. And they do sound great doing so! Even musically, the songs have gotten a more meaningful feel, with the drum and guitar playing sounding brilliant!<BR>In a day and age where 'Rap' and 'Hip Hop' CRAP rule our diminishing airways, it's good to see a few bands stand up, and experiment with their sounds (quite succefully I might add!) and get some descent music on the radio!<BR>Well done to Slipknot for trying something a little different! Any true maggot, will not be dissapointed...<BR>Only the make out ones will!
B00001U0E1|5.0|This won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1998. Stars Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow as the romantic partners William Shakespeare and his Muse, with Dame Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth I. This is a lush film to look at in many respects. The authentic period costumes is a nice touch. The film is mostly set in the theatre of Shakespeare's day. At this time, there were no female actresses. Only men were involved in theatre. Men played the role of women. Nowadays, it's twisted to think the first Romeo and Juliet were two men. The movie has no accuracy or truth to actual historic account. William Shakespeare was never romantically linked to the character Gwyneth Paltrow plays.<br /> The whole thing is a fictionalized, dramatic melodrama that never took place. William Shakespeare was married to Anne Hathaway but there is evidence he was unfaithful and loved the Jewish keyboard player &quot;Dark Lady&quot; of whom he writes about in his sonnets. The movie is merely Hollywood taking on Shakespeare and it has since been used in English courses throughout the US. Shakespeare is enacted by Joseph Fiennes who is doing a terrific job. However, I don't much care for Gwyneth Paltrow's performance, no matter how much Oscar appeal she was said to circulate. She comes off as pretty wooden and the typical romantic heroine straight out of a bodice ripper, romantic novel. All she does is fall in love for Shakespeare and even goes to the lengths of dressing as a man to be near him during production of Romeo and Juliet. Judi Dench, a sublime actress though she is, does not LOOK anything like the real Queen Elizabeth. They could have cast an actress who looked the part more truthfully. Judi Dench did a better job as England's Queen Victoria in the movie &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;. She looked exactly like her and her fastidious, overly refined manners were distinctly Victorian. And one last thing, Ben Affleck had no place in this film. Did he think he would win an Oscar too or some form of recognition ? Ben Affleck is not right for this movie, no matter how small the role. It just seemed out of place and I would have preferred to see a true Shakespearean legend in this movie like Sir Ian McKellen. But it's a movie that has a unique charm. The music is also very beautiful. Be sure and get the soundtrack if you really liked the music for this movie.
B0001HAISG|3.0|Perhaps I have to go back and read the story of Peter Pan to figure out why Wendy's dad and Capt. Hook were played by the same actor. Was one the total antithesis of the other?<br />The movie was OK, but not good enough to show to my grade 5 students.  Family viewing, OK, assuming that the family discusses the movie in a debriefing process.<br />Think about this: Wendy is just about to enter the age of getting her own space, prepuberty if not crossing into puberty already, evidenced by her distinct wishing to experiment with kissing mouth to mouth.  There is also Tiger Lilly, who grabs Wendy's brother and gives him hefty a mouth to mouth kiss, getting him all excited.<br />When Wendy gives Peter a real kiss, it was remnisent of the reverse roles in the fairy tales where the prince gives the peasant girl a kiss on the lips to bring her back to life. Peter was knocked out on the pirate ship, unconscious. Wendy gives him the big thimble, the real kiss, that lasts a while.  Why not just quick lip peck, or a kiss on the cheek, or on the forehead?  What's going on, here?  Nope, I couldn't show this to my grade 5 group, especially when I am trying to keep them from mouth to mouthing as it is.<br />Also, the fighting between Hook and Pan was a little too sinister, too dark sided.  Granted, Peter Pan had nice flying turns and maneuvers in the air, but the fighting was too aggressive, as an adult fighting a child so aggressively.  Why does an adult need to fight a child so aggressively?  At least in the video HOOK, there was more posturing than fighting.  In the kid's world, there is more posturing with adults than fighting; but on the perverse side, there is more agression of the adult forcing the child to have to physically defend himself. I think we call this child abuse.<br />Otherwise, the movie was OK.  The humor of the children was pretty good. The role of the parents and the aunt was on target.  The role of Nanna the dog-nurse was on target. Great special effects!<br />Maybe this movie's approach to Peter Pan should be analysed in terms of a study of adult to child relationships in a psychosocial way.  I just did not enjoy the aggressive engarde of the adult to child fighting, especially in the confrontation of Hook to Pan.<br />Advice to teachers planning to show this movie in class : preview the movie first, definitely. Not for gr. 5 and under. Don't just rely on the reviews. If you have a streetwise bunch of students who are older than their years, and who also live the dual world of adults literally fighting to the death with children, you might consider showing this video. Otherwise, put it on the list of movies to be watched at home. Yes the debriefing scenes on the bonus shows that the crew gives is OK as an afterthought. However, that part tended to be more interesting than the movie itself. If you view that part first, then the story itself, the movie is not as sinister because  there is a different foundation laid from which to view the movie.r />Maybe this movie's approach to Peter Pan should be analysed in terms of a study of adult to child relationships in a psychosocial way.

B00000G3Q4|5.0|There are about 6,000,000 editions of each Evil Dead film to get. The Book of the Dead may be the most tricked out, fleshiest edition of the film, but only diehards should get that version of the original film, and only in addition to this one. The fact is, for all its flair, the Book of the Dead is in the wrong aspect ration, making it unwatchable. If only buy one edition of Evil Dead, buy this one, which has ample extras and most importantly, the correct aspect ratio.

B00005RYLE|1.0|The Book of the Dead may be the most extras-laden, fleshiest edition of the original, classic Evil Dead film available in the US. However, like all US DVD releases, it has a problem- the aspect ratio is wrong. Get a multi region player and buy the UK 4 disc set.
B00009V7RF|5.0|There isn't a track on this that I don't love.  Get's my booty moving every time!  I bought this CD awhile back after hearing &quot;Hey Mama&quot; and &quot;Shut Up&quot;.  I was expecting to like a few tracks and skip the rest, but every single song on this album is tight.  Definitely one of my favorites.
B00018D44U|4.0|The things people are saying! WOW! Y'all are extremely negative and angry about this record-don't take it so personally. AND, on that note, the guy who talks about Norah JOnes not caring about her fans??? Do you KNOW her personally. LOOK folks, musicians don't write music for YOU, they write it for themselves,it's their catharsis NOT yours. If it happens to move you, cool. This ,as all things Ms. Jones has done in the past, personally- MOVED me regardless of how &quot;mellow&quot;, &quot;quiet&quot;, &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;country crap&quot;, y'all thought it was. I am as impressed as before AND, I have superb taste in music. Sorry all you other folks are so disappointed, life must suck right now for a lot of you!

B0001XALTG|1.0|The laserdisc version of this film with all of these bonus features was released before DVD became a format. Why did they wait so long for this? I wound up ordering a Canadian version of the movie to get the deleted scenes, and now suddenly they release all of the same stuff that should have been on the original release? Is there a good reason why the studios release junk versions of a film, and then five years later release a special edition?
B0000508U6|5.0|I'm a Coldplay fan since the appereance of this album! I think this one has something more charming than A rush of blood to the head, more indie, less spectacular, calm and relaxing.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|you musically close-minded people just need to stop wasting your precious little cry baby time writing a bad review for slipknot. first of all VOL 3. has just as much intensity and brutallity as the self-titled and IOWA. and there is no way stone sour had anything to do with the influence of VOL 3. so they tried more singing corey sang in the first two albums, remember WAIT AND BLEED, NO LIFE, PURITY, MY PLAUGE, GENTLY...etc. there was singing in those songs too so shut up about the sotnesourknot bullcrap!!!! and i cant even believe people would compare this to staind in any way at all, at least slipknot still kept the fast drumming and heavy ass riffs in their song unlike staind who completly changed their sound to a bunch of acoustic songs, (i have nohting against acoustic songs). and the slower songs, (VOL 3.) with acoustics still had the slipknot touch to them they were still dark and eerie, and not all sad and whiney. slipknot has made the ultimate evolution and took a big risk with VOL 3. i personally think there is more substance and meaning deep inside the songs. slipknot has shown all of us what exactly they are capable of plus more. they have beat their rough times with eachother and have made their musicianship much much stronger. and to anyone who cant see that, you be in a band and put out 3 or 4 cds with the same exact sound to them and see how far you get. this album deserves all positive credit and no negative credit from anyone! screw the nay-sayers, slipknot is clawing their way back to the top, all true maggots will stick with them till the end.

I only like 3 songs and they are just ok.  Her voice is so annoying everytime she sings she over do it buy screaming and yelling and on top of all that her voice is shaky, and she needs to chill with all that forreal!!!!!
0743216458|4.0|I bought and read this book after watching the History Channel's recent re-broadcast of the HBO miniseries by the same name.  While watching the mini-series, I was genuinely moved by the stories of Easy Company and wanted to read the book so that I could learn even more.<br />The mini-series did an excellent job of recreating what Easy Company went through, from the airborne training in the US to the battles fought in Europe.  The series also did a good job of giving the viewer a good sense of the camaraderie experienced by each member within Easy Company.  The book, however, only did a good job of conveying the camaraderie aspect of Easy.  Yes, the book does include maps of the campaigns fought by Easy and first hand accounts of the battles on D-Day, Caretan, Bastogne and Germany.

0670824399|5.0|Matilda is a five and half year old genius.  She is neglected by her parents, but still manages on her own to advance her education beyond her years by reading books.  To punish her parents, for their lack of interest in her and for their mishandling of her upbringing, she decides to play some practical jokes on them (or especially on her father who is a crooked car salesman).  As a parent of two girls who are 5 and 7 I was a little apprehensive about appearing to give approval to some of the things Matilda does, so I had to remind my girls that this was just a story, and they seemed to understood (or at least I hope they did.)  As the story progresses Matilda goes to school for the first time, and has to do battle with the evil headmistress Miss Trunchbull, who is an ex-Olympic hammer thrower.  She has been terrorizing the school for years by physically abusing all of the children who do not measure up to her standards.  She especially hates the younger children.  If they do anything wrong, she twirls them around by their hair as if they were a hammer and throws them out windows and across the schoolyard to help her stay in shape.  The kids would go home and complain to their parents, but the stories about the headmistress would be so outrageous that none of the parents believed they could be true.  The kids were left to deal with the headmistress on their own.<br />Matilda's first grade teacher Miss Honey is extremely nice.  She is the first person to recognize Matilda's brilliance and wants to help Matilda reach her full potential, but Ms. Honey has problems of her own, and isn't strong enough to face the Trunchbull either.  Since Matilda is being held back and is not allowed to use her brain to the fullest of it's potential, a force builds up inside of her.  This gives Matilda some special Telekinetic abilities which she uses to come up with a plan to defeat the Trunchbull and improve her and Miss Honey's future.  Roald Dahl tells another great tale that captures the kid's imagination and held them greatly entertained.  Quentin Blake's illustrations once again add greatly to the story.  Dahl touches upon some of his usual quirks that he hates, such television, T.V. dinners, and calculators.  He also seems to be against advertisement's that sell something for $9.99 instead of $10.00.  It was interesting to note that he does also mention several other children's writers in this story, and seems to give his own opinion on each.  For instance he has Matilda comment that C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien are great writers, but he believes their writings are too serious.  He believes children love to laugh, and that is why children's stories should have so much more humor in them.  He also seems to be a big fan of Charles Dickens.  My girls are now looking forward to seeing the movie that was just released a few years ago based on this book.ures the kid's imagination and held them greatly entertained.

0743490304|3.0|In reading this book, I felt like a native of Orlando,Florida where, without synchronized traffic lights, the cars jockey about, race one another, darting in and out of lanes of traffic like a school of fish, only to all arrive at the same traffic light, a cyclops mocking their efforts to get ahead of the pack.<br />This book succeeds in the thrill-a-page mode, so no dings there.<br />However, the author has to stop too many times to bring the reader &quot;up to speed&quot; with the characters. It's as if the characters have to stop the breakneck action, have a coffee break and discuss &quot;the show so far&quot; and then get back to the life-threatening situation at hand. The stops in the action<br />seemed very contrived and awkward, and were obvious asides to keep the reader abreast of the character's thought processes.<br />Unfortunately, the characters themselves are so diverse in their backgrounds that they cannot perform self-contained deduction without detailed conversations with the other characters.<br />However, the Corky character is hilarious.<br />Some of the science reference are weak or just wrong. He shows how &quot;Darwinian taxonomy&quot; can be used to classify his space-bug, but our current taxonomy system was devised by Karl Linnaus and predates Darwin by about 100 years. More unfortunately for Brown, the Linnaen system uses the Biblical book of Genesis as a foundation, not the discredited Darwinian theories. As an evolutionist, I would not mind throwing Darwin a bone if they were at least in the same century.<br />The twists and ironies are just too predictable and the last scene of attempting to rescue the heroin from the Triton is like a mixture of &quot;White Squall&quot; overlayed on the Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is trying to get Marian out of the plane before it explodes. This framework weakens the overarching event of the oceanic whirlpool, which by itself gets a big thumbs up for the means to vanquish the enemy.
0385491026|4.0|Margaret Atwood nails down the subtle cruelties that come with growing up female with female peers. From the perspective of adulthood, the narrator takes the reader through memories of her childhood and adolescence with a charismatic and capricious chum called Cordelia. Cordelia is a typical girl bully, charming to adults, but alternately sweet and vicious to her playmates. What is interesting is that the roles between her and the narrator are reversed once they are teens. Compared to the vivid world of the narrator's youth, her scenes in the &quot;present&quot; are somewhat dull, but that is a minor flaw. &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; shows that girls don't need today's glossy electronic trappings to torment someone to the point where they feel completely invisible. It also shows that empathy doesn't necessarily result from having been the object of bullying.
B00006J3WH|5.0|It's just like watching the episode &quot;Once More with Feeling&quot; only that they didn't have the images and all the other talking scenes.  I love that episode, I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer the complete sixth season episode about fifty times or so, you can like, listen to it on the go, you feel like you are watching the show.  I recomend it to everyone who likes musicals and Buffy.

B0001Z53AQ|5.0|The best songs on the album are....(in no particular order)<BR>Just Like You- Bizzare is funny as hell, by far the funniest in D12.<BR>Get My Gun- Good raps and nice beat<BR>B*tch- Nice flow by Em and everyoe else also does a good job<BR>40 Oz.- BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM, Proof outshines everyone on this song!!!! download the remix which has Lil' Jon in it!!!<BR>American Psycho II- Great song, would of been nice if B-Real was in it more but still its a good song...The WORST song on the album is in fact My Band, i hate when every Em or D12 have a cd the first single always sounds like My Name Is, or The Real Slim Shady, those songs mostly appeal to teenage girls and retards... <BR>BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!(or copy it...who cares just get this cd!)

B000000OAA|5.0|I guess that there arent any words to discribe how great this is. The reason why i bought this in the first place was that I liked all the songs from &quot;sheer heart attack&quot; that were put on &quot;classic queen&quot;, or queen's &quot;greatest hits,&quot; which was a good sign because those were two mixed bag conpilations.<BR>    But this was nothing but queen at it's most brilliant. It's 100% filler free ( the worst song was misfire simply because it was just good). Freddie Murcury was at his peek here( and that's saying a lot. Plus Has done some downright amazing guitar work ( especially his page-esque solo in the middle of &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;).  <BR>        IT is also one of thier notably more rocking releases featuring songs like &quot;stone cold crazy,&quot;&quot;Tenement funster( excellent vocas by may),&quot; and &quot;Now I'm Here&quot;. And has some of thier best prog. rock ditties like &quot;in the lap of the gods(parts 1, and 2),&quot;&quot; She makes me( a beutifull prog. ballad sung by may),&quot;   <BR> and a song towards the end called &quot;bring back that Leroy Brown,&quot; which adds ragtime to queens list of seemingly infinite genre bending.  <BR>   so as they say...<BR>                     ...leave it in the lap of the gods.
B000066NW0|1.0|I kind of liked this album from the couple of songs I heard on the radio. Then I heard her trying to sing live, twice--once on MTV and another time on the Tonight Show. Both times she couldn't sing in tune. Man, she sang bad! And her guitar playing was comletely bogus. I play guitar myself and I could see that she didn't know jack (...) . She wasn't even playing the right chords for the songs she was trying to sing. Then I find out that she only wrote the lyrics for the songs, not the actual music. What a rip-off! Jeez, even Alanis Morisette writes her own songs and she can really sing too. But Avril Lavigne is a total phony. Who is promoting her so hard? She obviously isn't making it on her own talent, because she doesn't have any. How come Avril gets all this attention when there are a bunch of really talented people who can write, sing, and play their own stuff and sound good live too?
B00018D44U|5.0|You do have to love mellow music to appreciate Norah Jones. She is a sensual artist. I listen to her music all day. It has a very pleasant calming affect. No it's not ALternative, heavy metal, or booty music. It for the mature audience. &quot;listening pleasures&quot; She's not a trashy blonde flashing as much skin as she can. She's proper. She makes her music the right way...not the porn way. I give her 5 stars. I'd give her more stars if there was a choice.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie should not work. It has a razor thin plot, no real character development, no redeeming message, and hardly a line of substantial dialogue. It is pure melodrama, and pure ingenious filmmaking. I thought the title was  gratuitous, and was not looking forward to yet another violent movie. I  wanted to hate it but I loved the cinematic references and the nostalgiac homages. It is not merely violent, it is a mockery of violence. Nothing of what happens feels real, and the viewer begins to question why the banal concept of reality should even be expected in such an artificial artform such as Filmmaking. It is funny and engaging on different levels. Tarantino has made another Cult Classic. If you are a fan of Hong Kong martial arts movies, Italian westerns, Japanese samurai movies and Anime, the low-budget Action flick, and 70's TV, then you need to see this! It is a real Postmodern work of Art. Now I'm hooked and I need to see Volume Two....Damn!
B000068OCS|5.0|I saw this movie my senior year in highschool, back in 2002. I can honestly say that i have never been moved in such a way by a film as i have been by Koyaanisqatsi. It is unfortunate that so many people my age don't take time to seek out other things aside from whats on the surface of popular trends. The film is great because it lets you interpret it in any way you like. To me, it showed how nature is at a standstil in comparison to the constant move of human life and technology. Nature doesn't have to remodel or update every year to keep up with people. We have moved so high up above it we forget its there, and without it, we can't exist. I will say this, you have to have an open mind in order to truley appreciate this film. Otherwise it will blow right by you and you wont understand it.
0679746048|5.0|Right from the beginning of Girl, Interrupted the author introduces herself as an eighteen-year-old named Susanna Kaysen. She encounters a session with a psychiatrist she's never met or spoken to before in her life. The beginning of the book is thrilling and exciting because you're not exactly sure where you're going to end up. Susanna is then sent away in a taxi, which takes her to McLean Hospital. It becomes very real and clear about what is going on if you've had similar experiences in life. <br />She stays in a ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital for the next two years of her life. By this point you really feel like you're right there with the writer. It all becomes very real and a little hard to read. This memoir of Kaysen includes horrible things that go on in the ward and at the same time she gives the readers a very clear description about the other patients in there. In the end the book brings you to a conclusion between mental illness and recovery. This book really showed me that life isn't as bad as I perceived it. I learned that when you think you've got it bad, you might not really  know what you've got coming for you-because as you get older the real world can sometimes catch up with you.<BR>     <BR>I would recommend this book to anyone that is struggling with a friend or family member that has a mental illness. It helps you to understand what pain they're going through and why they say and think the way they do. This was by far one of my favorite books I've read this year and at the same time it was my biggest life saver.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Hmmm, how I loved them in the beginning when their intencity &amp; brutality was the perfect dose of medicine for metal addicts worldwide. Their 'self-titled' album was original &amp; so intense, and then their second release 'Iowa' pushed the intencity further and pleased loyal fans (including myself) once again.<br />But after hearing their third effort 'Vol:3 The Subliminal Verses' that intencity has sadly left this band, which is bound to dissapoint just about EVERYONE who likes them!!<br />Buying this album would be disrespecting yourself and your musical integrity. Instead I'd recommend picking up their first two albums and enjoying what REAL Slipknot is!! <br />The next step for the masked nine will probably be an appearance on a damned Staind music video, weak Slipknot, totally weak effort. I won't go see u guys on tour, for the fear of you breaking out the acoustic twangers and singing us all a FRIGGIN&quot; LULLABUY.....DAMMIT! <br />&quot;Everyone who reckons this album sucks look at your monitor right now, lol&quot; <br />WTF HAPPENED SLIPKNOT?!!?!?!?!?!!
0688163173|4.0|&quot;Shutter Island&quot; was most of the time enjoyable. This book was often confusing at times. I had to read parts over again to try to understand it. By time I reached the end of the book, my main goal was to finish, not to find out what happens. But I must say, the book did have a very spooky and thrilling ending. And there were parts in this book that were exhilirating and very entertaining. If you are a person that loves mysteries. This is the perfect book for you.
0671015206|5.0|Who are the rich in this country?<br />80 percent of this group didn't inherit their wealth they earned their wealth.  They valued education, hardwork, and discipled saving.  One word characterizes them, &quot;Frugal&quot;.  They accumulate wealth by lower their consumption, making careful buying decisions, and saving or investing their excess.  They are not super financial traders or wizards, instead, they are smart-long term investors, usually trading in and out of stocks, annually.  Most help their children financially to obtain higher education degrees and homes.<br />What do they do?<br />Most have their own business.  They operate efficently by keeping their cost down.  One case study talked about a man who was the owner of a janitorial service.  This man's net worth excessed all the professional doctors, lawyers, and business men in his community.<br />This group have annual incomes with a few exceptions are less than 100,000 dollars a year.  In a small percent their income exceed a million dollars.  Most importantly is the fact they have high net value amounts for their age.  The medium age being about 56 years old.  The important factor about this group of people is they do not spend their money maintaining a certain lifestyle.  Their money has very little bearing on their lifestyle.  Their Net Value matches or exceeds : 1/10 * age * annual income.<br />Most have nice homes (paid for), medium value cars, and value oriented assets (land,real estate investments); however, they don't necessary require expensive foreign cars, expensive watches, memberships in multiple country clubs, nor expensive clothing.  They are not cultured on gourmet foods, rich social parties, or costly toys.<br />Where do they shop?<br />They shop at middle class stores.  The wives of this group are disciplined using coupons, and driving for a super bargin, demonstrating patience and researching their options for purchase, and acquiring when they discover a great deal.<br />What do they drive?<br />They drive domestic cars.  In some case they prefer new car purchases to used because of reliability, brand names like GM, Ford, Crysler, Toyota, Honda, Accura, and Infinity.<br />How do they invest?<br />They invest carefully.  A significant amount of financial planning preparation goes into their investment decisions.  Most have investment and some accumulated the bulk of their wealth through investments.  The majority are long term investors and very few trade daily.<br />Where did their ancestors come from?<br />The Scottish descendants are the riches group.  This group is very thrifty as a group.<br />How did they get rich?<br />This group became rich by saving and investing.  Their actual worth exceeds their age multiplied by their annual income times two divided by ten.  Most quickly moved out of education and into business where they realized cash flow.  They used the cash flow too start a business.  They didn't spend large amounts of money advertising, instead grew their companies slowly their thrift and careful decisions.  Over time these decision resulted in a realized increase in their net worth.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|Albums from artists like this really make me want to wrap my head in duct tape so I suffocate and die. There was an interview with her about those new \\"angry\\" lyrics and she said they came from her frustrations of dieting......yes. Let that sink into your skull for a second. I saw it on Fox News and yes...those were her words, I kid you not, Seems she was easily frustrated and that put her in a \\"dark\\" place. I read those lyrics and they're somewhat reminiscent to a bad PG-13 movie that has been edited for television, or a dramatic episode of \\"Saved by the Bell\\" (Screech gets V.D.). The sounds her band mates emit from their instruments is boring enough to trigger a \\"brown noise\\", making you soil your pants if you listen to more than half of any of her songs, kinda like Lionel Ritchie. How could someone like that even joke about claiming punk.....yes punk. That's like saying Backstreet Boys are death metal. She is pop music, \\"diarrhea complex\\" pop music that pollutes the air waves, she could not be farther from real punk music if she was a country star singin 'bout her husband cheatin on her, and her diesel truck. Like Metallica claiming \\"metal\\". Jeez, that's a laugh, people who believe that listen to this crap. This is completely pathetic and disgusting. The Casualties, Operation Ivy, Blatz, Discharge and Rancid are real punk music, how this little girl even comes close I don't know. It's like she was cleaning her ears one day and didn't realize when the cu-tip reaches resistance you don't keep pushing! Then the little girl from the suburbs decides to dress like a hobo?? That does not make you punk or Marky Mark would've been the next Sid Vicious. Come on now, she wears a neck tie with jeans? Regan Youth did that like 15 years ago!! But her fans wouldn't know that because they are 15 years old and don't listen to real punk music. How are you people that dumb to claim her as original or even music? Her voice reminds me of wet butt cheeks on a window. I'll bet you anything fans of this chick think Simple Plan is \\"hardcore punk\\" as well. That really is funny, the first time I saw those queens I was flipping through the channels and caught them on Nickelodeon, \\"because that's where I go to see what's hip in punk.\\" F*cking give me a break. I wont even suggest real punk for you to listen to, because this (avril lavigne) is sooo far from that genre of music you wont even recognize it. I'd really like to see a mosh pit at her shows. HAHAHAHAHAHA Some posers getting stomped, kinda like what would happen if you saw fans of this little girl's band at a Filth or Smachet show. It's like the whole f*cking world is on crack and I'm just drunk.....
B00020HEL6|5.0|For those of us (and I think there are many) who were left at the end of American Idol 3 with a big &quot;so what&quot; to the winner's version of &quot;Summertime&quot; this is the answer. Renee is the real deal. Her rendition of this one song alone is worth the price of the CD. I just cannot believe she's 14. She interprets songs with an unbelievable maturity.<br />What an incredibly gifted young woman. This CD is excellent. Like many, I saw her on the Today Show -- in a world of Britneys who are more trampy than talented, she is so refreshing. Plus...the music. I can't say enough. Thank you David Foster for yet another incredible find!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|&quot;If you don't own this album, then you don't own any music.&quot;  What an arrogant nonsensical response.  There are just as many people who would state that if this is the only type of music that you appreciate, then you don't know what real music is.<br />As for this album, it's just previously released material repackaged.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Okay, ONE of the best soundtracks. But you get the point. I like the Latin and Japanese music as well as the country music. All good. Get volume 1 too. It's equally great.
B00006879E|5.0|Bands that generally cater to the today's young adult audience never expect their sound to catch on to anyone born before 1970.  You know a band has made it for good once a song that was released only to mainstream formats is being played on radio stations that play the likes of Phil Collins and Celine Dion.  Simply said, Maroon5 are the best band to come out of this generation.  Sure, that may seem like an exaggeration to many, but never has there been such a broad range of musical styles molded together since Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine blended Latin rhythms and pop beats back in the mid-80s.  Songs About Jane is without a doubt a contender for Album of the Year; there is something for everyone on this beyond-superb album.  Many of the current bands today copy each other's sound resulting in a generic, wailing-like alternative style that seems more annoying than pleasing.  Maroon5 totally went the opposite direction by combining rock, alternative, gospel, R&amp;B, funk, blues, and pop together to create a sound that, up to this point, has been oblivious to mainstream listeners.  Songs like \\"This Love\\" excite the mind-and tongue-with its witty, catchy chorus lead by some funk guitar rhythms and piano playing.  \\"She Will Be Loved\\" warms the body and soul with its tender feel about the unyielding love one feels for that special somewhere, whereas \\"Sunday Morning\\" feels like a Stevie Wonder-type tune.  Also, \\"Harder To Breathe,\\" \\"Through With You,\\" \\"Not Coming Home,\\" and &quot;Tangled\\" exemplifies the bold mixture of alternative and funk with gritty vocals.  Lead singer Adam Levine, who also wrote the entire album inspired from his former long-time girlfriend Jane, sings so convincingly as if he was born to warm people's hearts.  Move over Justin Timberlake, this guy is the true soulful deal.  Levine's voice is sensual, coarse, and sincere all while containing true grit and vulnerability; the best male voice to come out of the new millennium.  Bands members Jesse Carmichael, Ryan Dusick, James Valentine, and Mickey Morris all contribute individual uniqueness with some stellar drumming, guitar solos, and some fervent organ playing.  All the songs on the album, all co-written by Levine and Carmichael, truly speak from the heart about the tormented pain love can cause.  These songs aren't all sappy and saccharine-these lovelorn tunes are rough, gritty, and bold (finally, songs that we can actually relate too).  What makes Maroon5 stand out compared to anyone else is not for the fact of their incredible fusion of sounds or deep, reflective songwriting, but for the fact that they are completely original in every imaginable way possible.  Even though it took a year for the album to take notice, they never for one second altered their sound to fit the trend.  Thank the Lord for Adam and the gang.  The mainstream crowd was, unquestionably, in dire need of these guys.  This is what music is truly about.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I've always been a fan of Avril's work, so when I heard she was releasing a new album, I went to the store and picked it up. While this album, Under My Skin, isn't quite as good as her first album, it does have its moments of greatness.<br />The first two songs, \\"Take Me Away\\" and \\"Together\\", are questionable, though; a shocker since the latter was co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk (by the way, check out her latest album) -- but another song Chantal helped write, \\"Forgotten\\", isn't all that either. Oh well, there are still some good songs on here, like \\"Don't Tell Me\\", \\"Fall to Pieces\\", and my personal favorite, \\"My Happy Ending\\". \\"He Wasn't\\" is okay, but I think the song was better when it was called \\"Sk8er Boi\\".<br />The calmer, smoother songs on here are also more accessible than they were on her first album. Like when I first heard \\"I'm With You\\", it took a while to grow on me, but the mellow songs HERE are pretty good at first listen, as evidenced by \\"How Does It Feel\\" and her dedication to her grandfather, \\"Slipped Away\\". Everything else is okay, and while this may not win Album of the Year, it's still decent enough to add to your collection -- that is, if you're a person who's open to give it a chance instead of just telling all non-metal artists to go to Hell.<br />Anthony Rupert

B0001Z52RU|4.0|I too, totally disagree with the crazy critics, this film was great. I was so shocked when I read people's reviews on Yahoo, because from what they said I was expecting some gory horror flick...erm..what the heck where they talking about?! I would only classify this movie as 'intense.' Please get this, the story is good, the acting is terrific *especially the little boy* and the images and the overall way it's presented is outstanding! Two thumps way up!<BR>  P.S. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't think that Ashton Kutcher is an incredible actor, although I was very pleased with him.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|Almost all Disney movies are based on dreams that became a reality in the end. Here in this movie Gepetto (Wood Carver) who wished for Pinocchio to become a real boy.You may say this is just a movie but it discusses one very important aspect of life. Its very important for young kids to say the TRUTH or you may end up like Pinocchio.When He kept telling lies his nose grew longer eventhough he's been warned by Jiminy Cricket (his conscience)to tell the truth.<BR>It also discusses true friendship and trust. Jiminy Cricket was upset when Pinocchio told him that he's with his best friend (other kid)on Treasure Island, Jiminy thought he is the bestfriend of Pinocchio.<BR>Above all,this is one very touching film.
078681859X|5.0|The main human character, Nathaniel, is not likable.  Not one bit.  And its about time to see that in a novel.  He's been mistreated most, if not all, his entire life and someone like that wouldn't be likable.  Even at the end he's not likable and I found that very refreshing.  You don't change people in the space of one novel.  It takes time.  Time that hopefully Stroud will give him.  Nathaniel has potential to go either way, bad or good, and that is quite fascinating.  I want to know how Nathaniel is going to turn out and how he is going to get there.  It's about time a character is allowed to realistically struggle between good and bad in a novel instead of forcing them to be good from the get go.  <br />Bartimaeus was a brilliant character.  His praises have been sung by the rest of the reviewers and I have nothing else to add in regards to him.  He was just awesome.  And the footnotes were great.<br />All in all it was a great novel and Nathaniel was perfect.  I can't wait to see if he ever starts to question what he is being told to believe.  Book two couldn't get here fast enough.
B00021TL20|4.0|Outstanding collection of one the best artists of the 80s. It would have been perfect though if &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, &quot;A Groovy Kind Of Love&quot; and &quot;Easy Lover&quot; were included.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is GREAT! Every song is so good you cant help but listen to the whole CD over and over. If you dont have this CD, you have to get it! (Avril Rocks!)
078322608X|5.0|This is not only one of Terry Gilliam's best movies but one of the finest time-travel films ever made. The story is great -- and in its logical tightness, it's right up there with the first _Terminator_ film (and the classic Heinlein stories 'By His Bootstraps' and _The Door into Summer_).<br /><br />The casting is amazingly good for 1995. Remember, this was before Bruce Willis was known as anything but a wisecracking action hero, and Brad Pitt hadn't yet turned into a national obsession (he'd already been cast in this one before _Interview with the Vampire_ and _Seven_ were released). In fact, when I first watched this film, I thought Pitt had been horribly miscast -- but it turned out I was wrong, as repeated viewings demonstrated. (Madeleine Stowe is terrific as well but that was no surprise then or now.)<br /><br />You probably already know the premise. James Cole (Willis) is a convict in 2035, and in exchange for a complete pardon he 'volunteers' for a time-travel mission. In 1996, see, most of the human race was wiped out by a really nasty virus, and the scientists of Cole's day want him to go back in time and help collect some samples of it in its unmutated form so they can get cracking on a cure. But something goes wrong . . .<br /><br />That's all I'll say, except to note that everything gets neatly wrapped up at the end. (And I mean everything. If you think there are loose ends, watch it again.)<br /><br />The screenplay is the work of David and Janet Peoples, so it's no surprise that it's well done; David Peoples was one of the writers on _Blade Runner_ (and he also wrote _Soldier_, which is set in the same world as _Blade Runner_). The dialogue is crisp and the exposition clear and swift. (In fact, it's arguably _too_ good: the film is supposed to be, in the beginning at least, ambiguous as to whether the time travel stuff is just Cole's schizoid fantasy, but thanks in large measure to the convincing screenplay, most of us know from the start that it's the real thing.)<br /><br />Of course it's Gilliam who brings all this together. If you've seen _Brazil_, you've probably already seen this one too -- but if you haven't, see both.s Gilliam who brings all this together. If you've seen _Brazil_, you've probably already seen this one too -- but if you haven't, see both.
B00006BTCA|3.0|I finally listened to TOTBL and found myself mesmerized by the inability of my fellow reviewers to leave the comparisons aside and let this stand on it's own. Anyone with taste knows that it will fall over quite easily as it lacks any form of backbone.<br />Just another boring example of how bands from NYC have the uncanny ability to impress the ignorant simply because they are from NYC. Yes indeed, NYC is the greatest city on the planet but Interpol leaves a great deal to be desired. It's not the worst recording I've ever heard, but it certainly isn't any better than average. I'm obviously pleased that this is taking people's attention away from The Strokes but in the end they are equally bad. Give them a few years and they will be deservedly forgotten.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I heard some of the songs on this CD at a friends house, and was not impressed at all. The only song I even came close to liking was Everytime, hearing that song made me hope for her sake when she crashes and burns; that she spends some time in a mental institution. I can really see why since her first CD each one after that has sold less copies than the one that came before it. The ulimate duet would be JC from NSYNC and Britney since they both seem to want to push such sexual material to young girls.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is even better than the original version (which i LOVED too). I want to give it a 7/5. We really should be able to.<BR>Anyway, it really is worth waiting and paying the slight extra fee for the extended edition. The added scenes are hard to distinguish, but it does add more depth to the story. I recomend this movie to all Lord of the Rings fans.
0061015725|3.0|I have been a loyal Crichton reader for a long time and have read all his novels except timeline, but I have to say that I was disappointed with this effort.  Here is why I feel this way.<br />Pros: As in all Crichton books, there are bright spots.  The Nanotechnology presentation and artificial intelligence programming ideas are very very interesting and well presented.  The underlying story of the main character's family life that leads into the main plot was surprisingly interesting well developed (perhaps a little over done even for some).<br />Cons: The plot and development in Prey was surprisingly weak for a Crichton book.  After reading the first half of the book, the book seemed so very promising and intriguing.  But, as if Crichton suddenly lost interest in the project, the story fell apart.  Not to give too much away about details in the book, the problems and conflicts presented in the book had disappointingly easy solutions. (the &quot;Nest&quot; section of the book read somewhat like a teenage action comic--cheesy.) Although the characters were in life threatening situations, I rarely felt any urgency in the book.  The deaths in the book were also uneventful (unlike Jurassic Park) because you do not feel much for the peripheral characters.<br />Overall, it was a pretty fun read, but I was very disappointed that this Crichton novel's plot and especially ending was so uncrafted.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've read a few of the reviews for the album and they're a very mixed bunch. All I can give is my opinion; I'm a long time Slipknot fan and have dug their sound since 98, and still do! Vol.3 The Subliminal Verses is an amazing album of experimental musicianship, it's about time a &quot;METAL&quot; band show some variety and maturity, and not just become another loud heavy act of repetitive noises. This album may be what takes Slipknot to the mainstream which may not be a bad thing!! I have waited a long time for heavier music or even just bands that play instruments and write their own music to be the main scene in music culture instead of this hip hop crap and all music alike that has drowned the real music scene. If you're just a narrow minded \\"METAL HEAD\\" then maybe you should avoid this album as you my just get angry at your stupidity in buying something that you can't understand. Those other appreciators of heavy music and all other good music from a musician's point of view should definitely add this to you respected collection of quality music. Slipknots best in my opinion. BTW track 9. Pulse of the Maggots is heavy as F**K.
038533348X|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's CAT'S CRADLE is one of the three books I simply could not live without (the other two are CATCH 22 and BARK OF THE DOGWOOD). But don't get me wrong---I like all of Vonnegut's works, it's just that this is my all-time favorite.  He is such a master a blending humor and darkness that few can come even remotely close to him.  My second favorite book of his would have to be BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Eminem's crew of Proof, Bizzare, Swifty McVeigh, Kon Artis, and Kuniva have often been dismissed as a group of average rappers whose biggest claim to fame is being \\"Eminem's buddies\\". Rather than spending a majority of their sophomore project, \\"D12 World\\", trying to disproof this theory, they seem to comically embrace it. Playing off the fact that even some of Em's most diehard fans have trouble telling the difference between Swifty, Kon Artis, and Kuniva.<br />The follow-up to \\"Devil's Night\\" was supposed to take D12 in a different direction as the group would show their maturity while Eminem would step back a little bit this time and give the other boys a chance to shine here. Well, if that's the case, they went wrong somewhere. Aside from a tribute song to their deceased former group member, Bugz (\\"Good Die Young\\"), this D12 album seems to follow the exact same format as their first one. Eminem still stands out more than anyone else in the group while the rest still try to do the \\"shock value\\" thing. The production is still as great as it has always been with Eminem and Dr. Dre behind the boards for a good portion of the LP but \\"Devil's Night\\" still beats them in that cateogory. There are a number of throw-away tracks and the first single, \\"My Band\\" is the same type of overplayed comic book rap that Eminem seems to shoot for in his first singles.<br />\\"D12 World\\" does have its moments (\\"How Come\\", \\"6 In The Mornin\\") but mostly has a lot of the same attempts to be shocking and repulsive (\\"Bitch\\"). Hearing the same anthems about pill-popping and transvestites really doesn't show much growth, it just indicates that perhaps the group doesn't have as much range as they'd like to think. Their whole anti-role model persona has already been long established since they jumped on Eminem's \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\". While it was somewhat clever back in 2000, it has more or less run its course here.<br />For a record that is supposed to help D12 break out of Eminem's shadow, \\"D12 World\\" plays an awfully lot like a collection of \\"Eminem featuring D12\\" songs put together on one CD. He's the first voice we hear when the CD starts, he sings almost all of the choruses, and he produced almost half the tracks on the album. It's understandable that the most popular rapper in the group will be all over the album but there certainly could have been more of an effort to exploit some of the other guy's talents as well. \\"D12 World\\" is stuffed with top-notch production from everyone from Dr. Dre to Hi-Tek but the subject matter is still the same as always.\\"D12 World\\" plays an awfully lot like a collection of \\"Eminem featuring D12\\" songs put together on one CD.

079284131X|3.0|I was talking to a friend of mine about Lord of the Rings; The Two Towers, and the fantastic new HBO series Deadwood that both have Brad Dourif playing small but very effective, and expertly perfomed supporting roles. My friend mentioned that he also played Charles Lee Ray a.k.a. Chucky, in \\"Child's Play\\", and I remembered ditching a day of high school, breaking into the back door of the theater with my friends and watching it. This movie was scary... When I was a teen.<br />Only to see Brad Doruif, I rented it again and watched it with my fiancée, and warned her that it was scary, but we both ended up cracking up through the whole thing. I felt really stupid telling her how scary it was. It made no sense to me that a plastic doll, the equivalent of a Cabbage Patch Kid, could overpower even a little boy. <br />The only thing that really saves this movie from being a complete waste of time was Brad Dourif, as Chucky. The little boy was just horrible. The cast, save Dourif, couldn't act their way into or out of a wet paper bag, the mother, the mother's friend, the police man who didn't buy her story about the living killer doll, the doctor who thought the boy was a nut; NONE of them could be considered good actors except for the damn doll! So it was a typical horror movie, minus the horror, but it was damn funny and I can understand all the sequels being made. <br />But I certainly will never understand how a plastic doll could be such a tough customer to people ten times bigger and stronger. If you see this movie you might notice that Chucky's victims often find excuses to be on their hands and knees, or prostrate on the ground so that Chucky can attack them and not get punted out of the room. This movie is good, but not great and nowhere near scary. You would have to be a teenager or a dummy like Chucky to think it is.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|This band attempts so slavishly to copy the style of In Flames (or, the Gothenburg sound in general) yet they end up with a product that is lackluster in every aspect. I mean, the riffs they are using have been done by a million other Swedish-copies, but these are even MORE single-minded and simple.<br />The video for \\"Unholy Confessions\\" says it all. Teenage outcasts confused about their sexuality obsessing over a band that is in the same boat. What a terrible mockery.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Although I do not normally watch movies like these -- overhyped ones, that is -- I rented this film and was surprised that I made it all the way through it.  The best thing about this film is Bill Murray.  He is one of the most underrated actors out there today and the fact that he didn't get the Oscar for his performance just shows how effortless he made his performance look.  I thought he was funny and poignant and I'm not sure this film could have worked without him.  The other character -- the young woman -- was also very good, very lost on her own, trying to find her place in a flailing marriage as she learns that the man she married suddenly isn't there anymore, that he's become some sort of poseur while working with the subjects of his shoots.<br />Now with all that being said, this is not a film for everyone.  Fans of action films, fans of films with a standard story arc will not enjoy this film because basically nothing happens.  There is no great crisis, no huge drama, not pivotal moment in the story where the viewers can say, &quot;Oh, okay...now let's see where it goes from here.&quot;  The story meanders along, lost, like the characters in the film.  At 1 hour and 45 minutes, it was a little long and despite the humor in the karaoke scene, I think that scene should have been cut out -- why Sofia Coppola lingered so long on that part of the story is beyond me.  Maybe she needed to make it a certain length for distribution?  Aside from that portion which nearly lost my attention, the film was very good and well worth watching if you're a fan of Bill Murray and character studies.  The look on Bill's face when he wakes up after a night with the jazz singer is worth the price of the rental alone.<br />Overall, a good film, but definitely not for everyone!!  Certainly not worth the Best Film Oscar nod, but still pretty good.
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|Marbles is a sprawling 2 CD work of catchy melodies, ambient keyboards and intricate guitars that grows on the listener over time.   Like other Marillion albums, it ranges from pop ditties (You're Gone, Don't Hurt Yourself) to intricate, extended 'head' pieces such as Invisible Man, Ocean Cloud, and Neverland.  The 'glue' binding it are four short number (Marbles I, II, III &amp; IV) strategically placed to segue the varied material together. This makes the whole thing sound and feel like a concept record.  Fortunately, the typical concept record excess is absent.  <br />Patient listeners will be rewarded with many high points.   Invisible Man, Fantastic Place, Ocean Cloud, Marbles III, and Neverland are five of the finest songs they've put to CD in 10 years or more.  Don't Hurt Yourself is about as catchy as they come and could pass for Oasis.  However, I tend to skip over 'Damage' on disk 2 - it's chorus ('who let the Genie out of the box/ did you let the Genie out of the box?') is annoying and too reminiscent of 'Genie' from disk 1.   <br />As to be expected the performances are top shelf. Steve Hogarth's ability to convey the emotions of his lyrics are tremendous.   Steve Rothery's guitars echo Hogarths' emotions and are never overly flashy or excessive.  The exceptional rhythm section of Ian Mosley and Pete Trewavas are extremely tight and criminally overlooked in rock circles.  <br />Bonus material contained on the deluxe 2 CD set available through [...] is worth the extra 8 Quid - the song 'Ocean Cloud' alone is worth the extra dough.  <br />My only serious gripe with Marbles is the quality of the recording.  While it is crisp, it lacks serious dynamics and seems somewhat over-compressed.  Furthermore, high frequencies sound rolled-off.  While these weakenesses may not be noticed by a casual listener, they're evident when compared to 'Afraid of Sunlight', a 10 year old recording.  <br />Again, this is a very good record.  Patient listeners will be rewarded with many spectacular moments.

B00000G3I2|1.0|This is another of the many films that create the self-examining (ie: 'personal inventory' [hint, hint 12-steppers]) genre where highly-powered &quot;yuppie&quot; couple, or single, travels back &quot;home&quot; to re-connect with friends and finds *gasp!* it/they have changed.<br />Or, regrettably a friend--whom no one has spoken to in ten years--has some terminal illness or suicides [it could never be HIV/AIDS?] and monetary-successful Wall Street broker returns to confront their lost idealism or the struggling artist, or academic professor, that has married their college [or high-school] significant other [yes, some writers in the 80's did possess the ability to use significant others as metaphors].<br />Can we call it &quot;the Big YAWN&quot;?<br />Someone says the wrong thing; someone spills a nasty secret. Someone cries; someone storms out of the room [horribly over-acted, as if this were Sunset Boulevard]; someone slams the door of their BMW/Porsche (depending on whether the car salesman convinced them they were a Gordon Gecko or a Joel Goodsen) and speeds off (barely able to hold car onto the road) to some dark watering hole where their former significant other will just happen to arrive minutes later to tempt them (ie: life-crisis when our Baby Boomer realizes how trite and droll their life differs from their youthful ideals).<br />Part of the plotline we're supposedly believing (or is it suspending belief?) is the late-1950's and the early 1960's as a sublime period of time--full of optimism [nevermind the Cold War, lack of personal freedoms, and violence of the period].<br />The music could have been the only redeeming factor for this movie, but many 80's films seem to choose between 60's soundtrack or hyper-synthesized melodies [see &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;] and unfortunately, this film lacks music score to distinguish it from the many 80's films of similar content and scores.<br />105 minutes.  Inhumane treatment of moviegoers.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|theis disic is not the best cd but i really like it ,slipknot had to change because they were being  put in a box and were only know as angry and upset men. As a maggot I feel that slipknot have just done what they should to get better respect from  the industry. The one probelm i have with the cd is that the songs are not well sang on the being parts but until you get to the chrous and those wonderful melodies.  This recored is a more mature recored for slipknot and I will bet everytime i will listen to it, the cd will get better and better. By the way if anyone think that slipknot have sold out!..... I got one word for you. THEY ARE GROWING UP AND SO THEIR MUSIC WILL CHANGE.  Before this cd came out they were a great metal band but know they are  a good rock band and if they stay the might become the biggest rock band in the world. But hey you might not know they might become like korn. I used to like korn but i am stating to hate them. I am a tolly big fan of slipknot before this album came out but know with the changes,They will just proberbly be a band i just like. Just as i said before they are growing up,so I am growing up and so my tast in music will change and slipknot might take a back set to bands like well more heveir stuff like hatebreed or those grage groups like white strips. but I still recammend  the new slipknot cd cause they will go away knowing that they will be know as the band that had the guts to change
B00005QG9J|5.0|Aahh...How I love \\"Morning View\\" by incubus. It's definitely their most chill album, probably because they got to hang out and make music in a kick-ass Malibu mansion and enjoy a few illegal substances. (He, he ; ) !) Every single song is wonderful, but I absolutely LOVE \\"Echo\\" more than any other song. It's so beautiful and simple. Just perfect and lovely. But, there are 12 other songs I must get to! \\"Nice To Know You\\" is a great opening track because it's one of the more rocking songs, but it still has its mellow moments. Jose's drumming is top notch, as per usual. \\"Circles\\" is a very nice rockin' song that get's you riled up from the beginning note. The lyrics are especially great on that one. Karma can be such a bitch sometimes. Anyway, the 1st single, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" sounds nothing like Pink Floyd's version, just in case you were confused. It's just a wonderful song that makes me wish I was on the beach with my boys from incubus. Now, another one of my favs \\"Just A Phase\\" starts off slow, but you know it's building up to a major sonic explosion and it doesn't disappoint. An amazing live song and just all-around great piece of music. Next, we have \\"11 am\\", a more melancholy, I-want-my-lover-back-now kinda song. It's very pretty and Brandon's voice sounds top-notch as always. Then, it's \\"Blood On The Ground\\", which is the \\"angry, pissed off, I'ma kick your ass if you don't stay away from me song\\" and it's good, but not my favourite. Then, the heart-achingly beautiful song \\"Mexico\\". It just might make you cry, man! You can practically hear Brandon's heart breaking into a million pieces as he sings about an incredibly selfish ex-girlfriend. Then, another single called \\"Warning\\", which has a really awesome video to accompany it. This is a great song about grabbing life by the balls instead of letting life pass you by. Then, of course, the afore-mentioned masterpiece of \\"Echo\\", hands down the most perfect song in the world, in my humble opinion. (Well, I've never been that humble, so whatever.) After that, \\"Have You Ever\\" asks the universal question \\"Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?\\" Another great rocking tune, indeed. Then we have \\"Under My Umbrella\\", a kick-ass song from beginning to end, baby! I love it very much. Standard great, intelligent incubus lyrics. And finally, the closing track \\"Aqueous Transmission\\", which is a little out there and weird and doesn't seem to fit in with the other songs, but that's OK. Every time I listen to it, I feel like I'm in the animated Disney movie \\"Pocahontas\\" for some reason. It just has that cool, quirky vibe. Kinda funny vocal stuff, but cool. Basically, this is an absolutely wonderful and amazing CD that you should own immediately! I love Brandon, Mikey, Dirk, Jose, and Kilmore!!

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV... Woa... All their attitudes &amp; styles encompassed in one 42-minute immortal masterwork. It isn't just the jarring, heavy presence of the epic Stairway, or the unsettling ending of When the Leevee Breaks, this album transcends everything. the gentler pieces merge fantastically with the hard blues-rock. All 8 tracks are time capsules, needless to say. Led Zeppelin IV is only comparable with being in the presence of God. P.S.: BUY THIS CD W/ ALL THE COOL ARTWORK... DON'T BURN IT... -Timothy Hurwitz
1593080492|5.0|This is a story of two sisters, marrian and elinor, which, though very similar in some aspects, and share a very similar unfortunate love affair, are total different in their behavior and approach toward matters of the heart. Tough both emotional in both seeking love and addressing it, one lets her emotions take over just about everything else, and the other have better balance between love and logic.<br />I'm not much of a period novel fan, and didn't like the emma tompson movie so much -  so i wasn't too keen on reading this book at first, but as i got into the pace of the story, i enjoyed reading it. what i mostly liked about this book is the fact that though it was written a few centuries ago, the emotions describe in it, and the moral this story tells are still very true till today. the way we all need to balance our inner world with consideration and respect for the outer world.<br />I've been helping two friends through a pretty messy break up while i was reading this book, and i kept quoting parts of it for them, trying to explain how the choice between &quot;being a marrianne&quot; and &quot;being an elinor&quot; is their's and how dealing with grief and lose might be effected by their own approach to love and life in general.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who ever suffered from a broken heart and had to deal with a break up. It's inspiring and interesting
B00008EYA5|4.0|S.W.A.T. remains faithful to the TV Series, even with the original music (which has not been updated). Sgt. Dan `Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel Jackson as his usual intense self) runs a nearly roguish group of SWAT members including Jim Street (Colin Farrell as his typical impish self), Michelle Rodriguez (as the `macho' wise-cracking female) and a host of other minor characters. When I say it's faithful to the television series, that's not exactly a positive comment. The action you see in the previews is fairly what you see in this film. Character development takes up most of the first half of the film (and there is not much to develop) and the rest of the action is just not what you would expect from a `blockbuster'. Alex Montel (a nasty Olivier Martinez in a nice role) is the murderous villain who gets caught during a minor traffic violation (What?). As the LAPD discover how big a criminal he is, they transport him to a more secure place as the media is allowed to film him shouting that he'll give one million dollars to anyone who can free him. Thus, every hack criminal in L.A. tries (unsuccessfully, of course) to get him for themselves. Now, if you could free him, what guarantees he is going to pay that million? Never mind - this is just a movie. We are even given a chase scene through the L. A. sewers and subway system (very trite). The action sequences are of TV quality and the only excitement is the finale when a hijacked Lear jet lands on the narrow 6th street bridge in L.A. When a film is made from a television series, usually the ante is upped significantly, but this new version of S.W.A.T. is just rehashed '70's TV screenplay. Only one good guy gets killed and we never got to know the poor chump. If you saw \\"Charlie's Angels\\", you probably had a better, more inventive time. (Ouch!)

Whats worse is the fact that Dr. &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy is having a sort of nervous breakdown, breaking in to Captain Spock's sealed quarters and giving Admiral Kirk an errie message from the grave.<br />When Spock's father, Ambassador Saarik, arrives informing Kirk that Spock isn't dead, but, is in a state where mind &amp; body are in seperate forms, its up to both, Kirk &amp; Saarik to find who has Spock's marbles (McCoy has them) &amp; where Spock's body rests (on The Genisis Planet). Once both are retrieved, and thru an ancient Vulcan ritual, only then can Spock become his old self again. With the arrival of the Kilngons, looking for the secret to Genesis, its a race against time as the planet becomes unstable and starts to deteriate at an alarmingly fast rate. The search isn't without sacrfice &amp; Kirk loses the two things he holds dearest to him in order get his friend back.<br />&quot;Star Trek III&quot; is one of those films thats pretty much written for fans of the series (if this film was your introduction to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, I'm pretty positive your reaction was more of a &quot;Huh!?&quot; with a shrug of the shoulders).

B0000D96NW|4.0|Pretty solid album, as all of theirs has been. Better than most but not a masterpiece. Definitly check it out.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is one of the most remarkable, well-made, and inspiring films made in recent years. It has touched millions of lives, influenced many people to return to church, and has given many a new found respect on religion. It is a film that everyone should see and needs to see. The DVD will be out on August 31st so go get it.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Most people are asking where's the parental advisory... I'm asking where's the music. This album is a let down. Corey mumbles to much, the hardcore music isn't there. Just a let down all over.
B0000029DD|5.0|As my title suggests, everyone should own this album. It's perhaps the most emotionally beautiful work EVER, and Buckley's voice is the best I have ever heard. He has an extraordinary range, and the tone of his voice is perfect. See the title track for example, with his 10+ seconds scream with unparalled beauty, emotional and chill factor. You can seriously feel his pain (so to speak) when it happens, as with the rest of the song. Tasteful and laid-back guitars and drumming is heard throughout the album. I like the use of synthesizers especially in the track 'Last Goodbye' and the title track. His soothing wordless voice on top = godlike.<br />This is absolutely perfect stuff. Not one song on this album is average or below. 'Hallelujuah' has an amazing guitar tone, and everything seems perfectly well in place. If you're worried about how accessible it might be like I did, don't. You may not completely understand it on your first listen, but that's the joy of it. Seriously.<br />This is one of the best albums ever, if I could keep only three albums from my collection, this would be in it. Get it now.
0618526412|5.0|This is an excellent book because of the exceptional ways the words are strung together in that, uhm, that really good way.  Yeah, that good way!  So I am bestowing on it five stars because that is exactly what it deserves.  I deem it so!<br />Dumb review, huh? But no dumber than a great many you can find on am4zon. The problem, as I've just demonstrated, is that any nut (present company excepted! :-) can write just about any inane thing they want about a book on am4zon, and if it doesn't fall miles outside some vague and inadequate \\"guidelines,\\" the staff typically refuses to remove it despite complaints from readers, authors, and publishers.<br />If it weren't for our admission that this is a bogus review, it would likely stay up permanently!<br />Here on am4zon you can find one line reviews, meaningless reviews, reviews that say things like, \\"I didn't read it, but someone said it sucked,\\" and generally clueless reviews that make you wonder what on earth the reviewer was thinking in actually posting publicly such total nonsense.<br />These grossly ill-informed reviews affect sales (a wash for the site as some of these reviews are positive but equally silly), authors' and publishers' reputations, and the quality of information available to book buyers.  But the site doesn't care, and its unwillingness to remove even the most absurd reviews means they stay.  This is why there was the recent scandal wherein it was learned that many authors had countered ridiculous bad reviews with their own anonymous reviews of their own works.  (Could you blame them for being deceptive on a site that the N.Y. Times reported to have accepted payments from publishers to \\"place\\" their books near the top of the site's \\"best seller\\" list?)<br />Clearly, am4zon needs to improve the policies and methods by which it administers reviews.  Please join me in getting this message out in your own reviews. Sadly, nothing else seems to get the attention of the staff here.<br />This \\"review\\"  should be no reflection on the book listed on this page.  We suspect Carson McCullers would have supported this effort to reform am4zon's review policies. (\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" really is outstanding, by the way. :-)
B000002JR8|5.0|Simply put, this album is THE must have heavy metal album.  Pantera truly have proven themselves as the &quot;Kings of Metal&quot; time and time again.  With Far Beyond Driven, they took the next step in their careers, releasing the most brutal, balls to the wall album they had released to that point.  While &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; may be a little more abbrasive and self loathing, Far Beyond Driven as an album is superior to it's follow up.  Any self respecting metal fan SHOULD have this album in their collection, no question about it.
B0001611DI|2.0|Yeah I saw this film right before the remake came out.  To sum this film up I would say it's like Shaft vs. the Zombies.  There is no horror in this film.  It's not scary.  It's funny if nothing else.  The zombies are very pathetic; George Romero doesn't even hide this.  Now I'm not saying you can't put horror with comedy (evil dead 2).  But the enemy isn't threatening.  There are only one or two really gory parts in the entire movie.  The zombies in the remake are much more dangerous.  This film is pathetic simply put.  But that's not to say I didn't enjoy it.  In fact I've made it sound much worse then it really is.  And I also enjoyed \\"Night\\".  I've seen much worse and if you have a few hours to kill; check out this little late 70's classic.<br />I'll add this statement, due to the person below me (Jeremy Boettcher) saying that if one thought it was cheesy than they think that i know what you did last summer should win an acadamy award.  So to clear things up, i HATE WITH PASSION films like Scream and \\"Summer\\".  My favorite Horror film is the Orginal Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Just because everyone praises a film like dawn dosn't make it good.  Break down the structure/acting/events of the film and you would realize that there is nothing special about this film.

B0001Z53AQ|1.0|What's up with him trying to be some kind of anti-pop star? When he released The Marshall Mathers LP, he was great.The first D12 record was decent as well.Now that 'My Band' is out, I realize that Em makes fun of all these boy/girl bands and such to be funny.Em,dude,chill out with making fun of pop groups, because you have gone pop yourself lately,the only difference is that you use cuss words and I guess you feel big in doing so.In &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; when you made fun of the boy/girl bands I found it funny,now it seems that's all you know how to do. GO BACK TO MAKING GOOD MUSIC EM!!!!!!
B000003TAR|5.0|When I first heard this CD, I thought it was a waste of money, after all, I could get the two songs that really struck me out of the iTunes Music Store. Those being &quot;tourette's&quot; and &quot;Rape Me.&quot;  Eventually, as I listened to the CD more and more, I found that the other songs were pretty good also. Those two still on the top of the list, though. And there they both still sit to this day. Milk It, sitting ALONE on the bottom. The rest seemed pretty good.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|It is too bad that I can't give her 6 stars! Alicia Keys is a musician's musician. What can't she do? Who woulda thought that she could surpass the excellent standard-setting &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;? Well, this album is so much more mature, and it is hard to say that considering the greatness of her debut album.<br />If I were to choose a flaw, I'd have to say some of the song choice.  The first half of the CD is more memorable than the latter half (though I like all of the songs).  My favorite songs are &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Heartburn&quot;, &quot;If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By&quot;, &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, and &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;. Alicia Keys is great. I hope she continues to set the standard for upcoming artists. 5+ Stars
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this album gave me chills...you have to understand...i hated slipknot...i knew since they came out they cound always do better...now they go and blow me away...no song sucks...and it never goes where you think it's going...all the maggots are passing up a great thing...this is what metal is supposed to be...ugly...and beautiful.<br />p.s. compare this to staind and you deserve to self-combust.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This is the best show I've seen in a long time.  It's pure escapism at it's best!  Something you can come home after a hard days work and totally veg out with.  Oh, and Clark Kent (Tom Welling) being a total hottie doesn't hurt either.

0393307050|4.0|The Aubrey-Maturin novels a series of very highly acclaimed historical novels, of which 'Master &amp; Commander' is the first. The novels take place during the Napoleanic Wars, when all that stood between Britain and the armies of Napolean was the Royal Navy. How different the world might be if Nelson had not been victorious at Trafalgar.<BR>Patrick O'Brian very convincingly and in great detail immerses the reader into life on board a Royal Navy ship circa 1805. However O'Brian does not help out his readers much. I am tolerably well versed in history and geography, but I have to admit a map would have helped, and a little historical background wouldn't have hurt either. As for the nautical terms and jargon I was completely lost. But the story was entertaining and the detail of Royal Navy politics and shipboard life was interesting. It wasn't an easy read and although I'm sure I will read the next in the series, I didn't feel the need to seek it out immediately. Bottom line: if your interested in sailing or military history, you will probably enjoy it- others should steer clear.
0671027387|5.0|I am a thriller author (Starpeople: The Sirian Redemption) so approach books with a critical eye.  I must say, Dan Brown has my attention, big time!<br />Having heard all the acclaim for his Da Vinci Code, I never picked it up because I'd read the non-fiction book: Jesus the Man, by Barbara Theiring.  (...)<br />But, so many people gushed about The Da Vinci Code, I finally purchased his most recent books and thought I'd work up. (As an author myself, I love to see an author's progression.)<br />Well, if he tops this, Dan Brown is super-human!  I spent the weekend reading Deception Point and honestly couldn't put it down. His research was incredible. The pacing--a real page turner. Don't miss this one!
B0001FGBL6|5.0|Every now and then a band simply takes my breath away, and they quickly enter the hallowed halls of my top favorites.  While Iron Maiden will ALWAYS hail from the very top position, others, like Nightwish, Blind Guardian, Kamelot, and Symphony X, proudly sit in the second tier.  This new Dutch band, Epica, has now joined the ranks with their debut album, The Phantom Agony.    Mark Jansen left his old band After Forever to form Epica last year.  And if you liked After Forever, you will love Epica, as he has taken all the beloved elements of AF and added more operatic elements for a more <ahem> epic sound.  His main female lead singer, the very sexy and charismatic Simone Simons (yes, that is her on the front cover), has a voice very much like Tarja Turunen of Nightwish.  She is another terrific mezzo-soprano who could easily hold her own on any opera stage.  (To get the two of them on the stage together would be mind-blowing!)    Indeed this could rightly be dubbed \\"opera metal\\".  Not only does it highlight the aforementioned operatic quality of Simone's voice, but Jansen has eloquently contrasted metal guitars with classical strings and a classically-trained choir.  Furthermore, the lyrics all have a deep, emotional story-like quality to them.    Some people may actually have a little trouble with this album even if they are fans of Nightwish.  Guitarist Jansen provides the extreme male vocals on the album (as he once did in AF), and some people want nothing to do with this type of singing.  Two or three years ago I would have fully agreed with this assessment.  However, I have recently come to have a strong appreciation for this element of European metal.  In this case, Jansen's growls provide a wonderful counterpoint to the beautiful and ethereal vocals of Simons.  They play off each other magically, almost like necessary opposites:  like yin and yang, or night and day, or good and evil.    And this brings me to my final point.  Much like After Forever, the lyricshave incredible depth that touch so many levels of the human experience, especially religion, politics, and philosophy.  (Jansen himself studies psychology at the University of Maastricht).  These are not your typical American \\"sex, drugs, and rock & roll\\" lyrics; nor do they dwell on the subjects of relationships or teen angst.  To borrow that old phrase, they seem almost like \\"a puzzle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\\".  As a great example I would draw your attention to track 6, \\"Facade of Reality\\".  On the surface, it seems to be a simple lament of the events of September 11th, and how religious fanatics changed the world with fear and terror.  But dig a little deeper and you might find it is also a comment on the lies and manipulation of the supposedly \\"good\\" world leaders like Bush and Blair and how they have also used fear and terror to their advantage.    Believe me, the music and lyrics are that incredible.  I got this album just over two months ago, and I have yet to get sick of listening to it every day!
B000000WHX|4.0|It's hard to listen to Massive Attack's debut album without thinking of their extraordinary &amp; subsequent work. Preferably, I'm a BIG fan of their collaborations with various grand artists. The real winners from this album are the tracks which feature Shara Nelson-- whom has a great yearning/vocal style which is definitely comparable to Sinead O'Connor (Another MA Collaborator)-- probably because both O'Connor and Nelson have that British mourning sound about them, plus both of them work so well with the sound of Massive Attack.<br />''Safe From Harm'' is definitely the best track off this album, with a over-looped and tripping atmosphere, Shara's voice sounds amazing on this track, plus there's a male vocalist over there too. As-well as the biggest hit off this album is probably ''Unfinished Sympathy'' and is undeniably one of their most popular songs along with ''Protection'' but that's on their second album.<br />The title track ''Blue Lines'', set's the standard for ''CLASSIC'' trip-hop. ''Daydreaming'' takes off with a sweeping pulsed beat, you hear Shara making an intro for the song, then comes more of Tricky's vocals, it takes a turn for the more rap/hip-hop side. Other great tracks are ''Be Thankful For What You've Got'', ''One Love'' and ''Lately''. <br />Bottom line is, this album is great and it can stand up on it's own, but I vastly prefer it's successor's such as ''Protection'', ''Mezzanine'' and recently ''100th Window''...<br />These guys have spread their influence over to Portishead, Bjork, Madonna a.k.a (The Queen Of Pop), Tracey Thorn/Everything But The Girl, Sinead O'Connor, Shara Nelson, Elizabeth Fraser, Sara Jay, Horace Andy, Tricky, Goldfrapp, Mos Def...etc (I could go on forever naming all of the artist's)...this just show's what a FANTASTIC group this is.--- They may not have the overexposed popularity of the unsuccessful/bland artists like Britney Spears, Beyonce and Justin Timberlake...But WHO CARES?...Massive is here to make ''MUSIC''-- not to impress public relations. <br />Massive Attack is just ''too good'' to be compared to anything like that... Great Album, Definitely worth every cent!.
1592220053|4.0|The half dozen short stories centre on Haviland Tuf, a fastidious, pompous, somewhat misanthropic character, who outsmarts his foes, and appears to be the only person with integrity in the whole universe. The superior prequel story describes how he gained possession of an ancient but technologically massively advanced juggernaut - its most crucial capacity is genetics. Tuf can create virtually any species he wants - from devastating viruses to gentle cute grass-eaters to beasts of nightmare.<br /> <br />The story that started this collection (all written for Analog) probably came from the old notion that the technology we have now would make past cultures view us as God/s. In `Call Him Moses', Martin sets up a self-styled prophet who takes over a planet by (secretly non-miraculously) reproducing most of the plagues of Exodus - the executive hand over office under threat of the first born`plague'.<br /> <br />Our `hero' deliberately appears to this dictator as a pillar of light, saying I am the Lord God. With his far greater technology he displaces the `false prophet'. Martin pushes this pretty hard, having his (not ironic or undermined) protagonist sincerely say for all intents and purposes in this case he is God because of the planet altering powers his ship gives him.<br /> <br />The same theme is explored in `Manna from Heaven', written seven years later. Faced with an absurdly overpopulated planet which, after every chance to work on birth control (something their religion abhors), is descending into anarchy and expansionist warfare, Tuf devises a plant that will essentially sterilise 99% of the population.<br />\\"You have no right,\\" declares the (straw woman) president of the planet. \\"...Who the hell gave you the authority to make that decision for them? ... You're no better than we are. You're only human ... What gives you the goddamned right to play God with our world and our lives?\\"<br /> <br />...\\"I make no claims to godhead in the mythological sense, \\" [replies Tuf,] \\"Yet I submit that I do indeed wield the power of a god...I traffic in the life and death of worlds. Enjoying as I do these godlike abilities, can I rightfully decline the accompanying responsibility, the equally awesome burden of moral authority? I think not.\\"<br /> <br />Normally such a declaration would have the reader saying with Tuf's antagonist, \\"He's insane.\\" But Martin is pushing us to think a little deeper. A cool theme that emerges is that we should recognise our responsibility rather than just act as if it doesn't exist. Learning to be comfortable with the power we have is actually admirable. It'd be great if he wrote something about this relating to the responsibility we in the `1st world' automatically have to the `3rd world' - with every purchase we make.<br /> <br />Tuf persuades the president with the analogy of the way he sterilised his cats:<br />\\"... Ultimately, as you yourself will discover, there are but two fundamental options. You must either reconcile yourself to inhibiting the fertility of your cats, entirely without their consent, I might add, or, failing that, some day most assuredly you will find yourself about to cycle a bag full of newborn kittens out your airlock into the cold vacuum of space. Make no choice, and you have chosen. Failure to decide, because you lack the right, is itself a decision, First Councillor. In abstaining, you vote.\\"<br /> <br />\\"Tuf,\\" she said, her voice agonised, \\"don't! I don't want this damned power.\\"<br /> <br />I can see in this why he deals so well with the nature of kingship in his, `Song of Ice and Fire' series, particularly Danerys. Also putting the power thing into this context doesn't offend my sensibilities as a Christian who actually does think God is not merely a myth, and all believers fools and/or manipulative liars.<br /> <br />While these two stories are easily the most challenging thematically, they don't really set the tone for the book. Interesting that the first story written, `Call Him Moses', comes second last. The earlier ones are all prequels, most written seven years later in `85. The longest and most enjoyable, `The Plague Star', is simply a thriller - Tuf has to kill or be killed by the individuals in the landing party attempting to claim the valuable ship. We then have novel accounts of how Tuf deals with the ecological problems of various planets.<br /> <br />There is another theme: despite him solving massive problems, his solutions are generally resented by those he rescues, and his motives always unjustly impugned (projection). This may be Martin deliberately setting him up for godhood, rightly seeing that justice from above, even in response to calls for help, often just results in rank ingratitude and abuse.<br /> <br />A weakness, however, is that no other character is given the sense or personality to actually appreciate or even understand Tuf's actions. Because some of these actions are so clearly helpful, this means everyone else is either stupid and/or ugly, or inconsistent. Tuf's eccentricities and virtue could have been much more enjoyable if he'd had at least some sympathetic characters - his precious cats aren't enough for me.last.

B00018D44U|5.0|It is rare to buy an album where every song is a keeper.  This is one of those albums.  Of course if you like garbage music like hip hop and most modern country, you probably won't like this.  This is music with a melody sung by a woman with the voice of a Goddess.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I go around saying I can't little avril and then I go and buy this album because I can't get the song &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; out of my head. So the verdict: Typical angry chick rock you'll hate yourself for loving. Highlights. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; &quot;Falling to Pieces&quot; &quot;Happy Ending&quot; and &quot;Slipping Away&quot;. Yes, ladies and gentleman, it's mindless fluff, but it's so much fun.
038073186X|4.0|This is a strange novel. The atmosphere is so heavy, the characters so stereotypical, the action so creepy, that you wonder if you're supposed to think this is more subtle than that. It is, but not in the way you expect, and I can't say more without giving away the big surprise of the plot.<br />Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule are U.S. Marshals, sent to the mental facility at Shutter Island to assist in the search for an escapee, a woman named Rachel Solando who killed her children and has been incarcerated in this facility for some years. The facility holds only the most dangerous criminals, violent and delusionally insane, and tries a varied regimen of treatments to deal with their problems. The difficulty comes in that the Marshals are convinced that someone's not telling the truth: the escaped woman apparently dissolved and walked through walls to escape, and it seems everyone at the hospital is lying about what happened. Nothing seems to make any sense. As they investigate further, things get stranger and stranger, and then stranger still.<br />I enjoyed this book, but I can't recommend it wholeheartedly. It's not that suspenseful, more atmospheric than anything else, and the plot twist isn't completely unexpected, just a bit strange. It's also a bit derivative of a popular movie of a few years ago (I won't tell you which one, because it might partially ruin the twist for you here) and somewhat depressing. I did enjoy the book, and I would recommend it, given those shortcomings.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Many of us have been waiting 10 years for these 3 movies to come out on DVD and its about time! I cant believe the poor comments in the reviews here. Nothing out there will compare to these 3 movies done properly in Dolby 7.1 surround. There are a lot of fake DVD's out there recorde off the films but they have poor quality sound and video. These will be official and will be great! I have waited 10 years for this.
6301978587|4.0|I love Barbra. I saw her final Concert in Los Angeles so I am a fan! I like this movie! HOWEVER I did not Love it! I think this  movie is TOO LONG!  Since this is Streisand's  baby you can see every frame was a labor of love!   If you want to see a great Streisand movie get &quot;Funny Girl&quot; However Barbra if your reading I would trust you would do a great job of acting and directing in the muscial adaption of Sunset Boulevard! You are the greatest star of them all!
B000127LW2|5.0|This is some of the best packaging I have seen for a highly commercial product.  I am a Graphic Designer and Art Director and can tell that some thought went into it.  The simplicity is wonderful.  The plastic is a perfect solution and a refreshing change from the typical black (good package design is about using materials well).  It also allows for each season to have a completely different and all-encomapassing color.  The simple disc design is classy and effective.  Granted, some good liner notes and inserts would have been nice.  But that is a different issue.<br />The content of the DVD's is, of course, excellent.  I have been a fan since the show started, and finally being able to watch the episodes whenever I want is wonderful.  I enjoyed each season (and took each one with a grain of salt) but this first one has something special about it.  Everything seems fresh and exciting.  Worth the money.
0385336810|4.0|I liked this book a lot, though not quite as much as the Shopaholic books, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I liked the premise for the book; it was interesting and fun reading.  I recently read that Kate Hudson is going to star in the movie version of this book... congratulations to Ms. Kinsella!  The only other thing I'll mention here is that there seems to be a pattern in all of her books that the heroine ends up with an extremely wealthy man, out of pure luck.  A nice thought, but how often does that translate into reality? That aside, I still love all her books and am anxiously awaiting Shopaholic and Sister - hurry September!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd is absolutely awesome! In my opinion Iowa is a little bit better but this cd kicks some major ass for sure. The few acoustic songs are wonderful too, they show that Corey really has a great singing voice and is not only in to the brutal screaming. If you like Slipknot and even if you dont this cd will most likely change your mind. Pick It up today!
B000002I27|4.0|This indisputable rock masterpiece includes that one song that exemplifies what I consider the true Doors sound: &#34;Strange Days.&#34;  Sure, most of the songs in The Doors' catalog are good, but not the same way the title track for this album is.  Marked with an eerie pulsing quality, the melody and effects seem to emanate like concentric circles, with Morrison's voice that of a demented ringmaster shouting down from the periphery of our consciousness.  It's a creative milestone.  It is a sound I wish they had explored more often, but was to be actualized only rarely, and never really quite the same way.  From later albums, &#34;Not to Touch the Earth&#34; and &#34;Waiting for the Sun&#34; come to mind as created from that same haunted cavern.<br /><br />Not of the same feel but still a particularly fine composition from STRANGE DAYS is &#34;I Can't See Your Face in My Mind,&#34; with its lyrical abstraction and tearfully cracked vocals, and ending with a lone note eventually tweaked and dropped into empty space.  Along with &#34;Crystal Ship&#34; from the first album, this song stands among the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br /><br />Thirty-five years later, the album stands the test of time.  &#34;When the Music's Over&#34; seemed for a while to me a bit bombastic, seeming more experimental to me than it did originally.  Then I came back around to appreciating it all the more, all over again, and reaffirmed this album's ranking among my all-time favorites, and I've even more recently found myself reacting to is as viscerally as I did during my original experience with it.  Overall, this album is an example of The Doors at the crux, which in hindsight turned out to be their peak.  They never seemed to regain their focus or footing after this.<br />___________________________________________
B00013RC8O|5.0|I own over 1000 DVDs. Most I haven't gotten around to watch. In three days I've watched this one 3 times. Maybe this explains why when I was a kid I sat through this like a zillion times in the theater. A perfect film....
0792839692|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid. I marveled at the whole idea of not aging past thirty (being ten years old that seemed, to quote Logan, \\"...years away.\\").<BR>I marveled at the costumes (escpecially Jessica's- and I wasn't sure why? Hormones starting to kick in I guess) and the jet black of the Sandmen. And the flash of their weapons (no beam like on Star Trek...I thought that was cool).<BR>Hell, I even watched the short lived T.V version that aired on CBS in 1977 With Gregory Harrison as Logan and Heather Menzies as Jessica(really BAD 70's TV!!!)<BR>As I look at The film now, I feel the over all look of the production was wonderful. IT was the star more than the plot or the actors.<BR>(at about the same time the Gerry Anderson TV show<BR>Space:1999 'suffered' from the same thing).<BR>If writers had adapted the book (which I read years later) it would've been a better movie.<BR>I hear Brian Singer (X-Men and X-2 director) wants to re-make Logan's Run for todays audience -taking more from the original source material.<BR>No doubt it will work...but I still get something out of the 1976 Logan's Run. <BR>Maybe its seeing things through the eyes of a ten year old. Maybe it was beacuse at the time any Science Fiction that wasn't Star Trek was good (even then, how many more times could you watch \\"The Trouble with Tribbles.\\")<BR>Maybe because it's SO seventies. It's just...kinda cool.<BR>I do recomend Logan's Run if as nothing more than a peice of overlooked science fiction history.<BR>And If you can find the Books...read those too... \\"Logan's Run\\" by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, \\"Logan's World\\" and \\"Logan's Search\\" Both written by William F. Nolan.<BR>I don't think you'll be let down.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have to say this is Slipknot's best album they have released so far. They obviously put more work into this album than the other ones. There are no f-words on this one. all of you parentally sheltered kids can buy this one with no trouble. goddamn parents. anyway, this album kicks because they have matured but still have their thrashy antics. the first few songs are softer, but the rest of the cd is pure 100% hard core. you all should buy this cd if you are a metal fan. actually you should buy this cd if you are a metal fan or not. because it kicks ass. yeah. i dont feel like typin no more. just buy the album. oh, yeah, IF YOU DONT LIKE THE CD BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SWEARING: YOU ARE A JACKASS. SWEARING DOES NOT MAKE A CD. GET THE HELL OVER IT.
B00006LHYC|5.0|What a great album! I've been listening to Laura Pausini since long time ago, actually have some of her spanish albums but this is the first one I listen that's entirely on english. I tried to search for this album in my local music stores (even in Argentina) but seems only available to people in the US, so I bought it and I dont regret it. Some melodies are familiar to me, who had listened these same tracks on spanish vocals, and some others are just impressing. She's got that candid, pop, sweet voice that distinguih her from the rest. <BR>You should buy this album if you havent heard her sing in english, and if you had, try buying some of her spanish-only albums.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|One of the key points I thought was McNamara's post mortem on Vietnam.<br />That just because the US is the most powerful country on the earth - economically and militarily she does not have the right, nor is it in her own people's interest to use this power UNILATERALLY.<br />And yet that is what the US has done in Iraq.<br />By all means invade Iraq but convince the UN of the merits. Not only does this ensure decisions are properly thought through they lend legitimacy to military intervention.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Loved her first cd, but the second one IMO wasn't as good as the first one.
B00000JHAU|5.0|I had never heard too much about Belle & Sebastian other than a good word and the occasional rave review and didn't give them much thought. I heard 'Like Dylan In The Movies' at a friend's house and had to hear more. This album completely exceeded all of my expectations and made me a permanent fan of the group.<br />Musically, the album is very folkish, with most acoustic guitars, or clean electric guitars. On some songs ('Seeing Other People', 'The Fox In The Snow') the piano is the dominant instrument. Many of the tracks are also augmented with trumpet melodies ('The Stars Of Track And Field') and gentle string arrangements ('Like Dylan In The Movies', 'The Boy Done Wrong Again'). The lyrics are another high point to this album, they are absolutely fabulous. Sometimes dark, sometimes thoughtful or introspective, and always interesting.<br />Despite what a few reviews say, this album is not esoteric or difficult. It's actually quite catchy and melodic, even easy on the ears. It's very quirky and has that very Anglo European kinda feel to it. The music is very tonal and really quite simple and pleasing. It's not an album that \\"scenesters\\" have to pretend to like, because it easily gets by on its own merits. If you've heard good things about this group, please buy this album, it's well worth it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I couldn't wait until this CD dropped and it is all that I thought it would be! Kanye is a lyricist, thought-provoking, and master rapper.  I purchased this CD and have all good things to say about it.  He has gone through some major issues in his life and now, finally he is where he needs to be and that is in the music industry.  There is no where but up to go for Kanye and I wish him all the best.  I hope he makes it to Raleigh soon.
B000002IWQ|2.0|In my 15+ years of listening and buying this bands albums I can not for the life of me understand peoples ethusiasm for this record.<br />Counterparts seemed to be a welcome change as the band dropped more of its keyboarding sound, and Alex started to do more riff rocking guitar action.  Don't get me wrong, Alex and Geddy do some decent grooving on this album, but there was a big problem.  And it is the biggest problem on the album.<br />That problem was Niel.  Niel Peart who is considered probably one of the best drummers who ever lived, fails to live up to his impressive playing on this album.  Basicaly Niel's drumming on this album is predictable and borish.  There are no fancy rolls, or intricate beats or anything to get you moving.  In fact everything I think is 4/4.  But the worse was yet to come.<br />Niel who is the principal lyricist for the band, has penned his WORST lyrics ever (yes worse than Caress of Steel).  Songs are peppered with incredibly CHEESEY lyrics, and many of the songs just reak (Nobody's Hero, Everyday Glory), sound stupid (Between Sun & Moon), have stupid song breaks that kill the momentum (Cut To the Chase, Double Agent), or are just titled idioticly (Speed of Love).  He really dropped the ball on this one, and Geddy's vocals come in at the most weird tonnes, and awkward places making everything 10 times worse.  No don't get me wrong, a song about AIDS is great as long as it's done well.  However Nobody's Hero is just the most corniest, cheesiest, weepeist, sachrinst thing I have ever heard.  Never mind the exhausting outro string section that's beaten over your head to death... <br />Let's look at some more lyrical cheese shall we:<br />\\"For You and Me; sex is not a competition<BR>For You and Me; sex is not a job description\\"<br />-Alien Shore<br />\\"AHhha ha to yes why the sun?\\"<br />-Between Sun and Moon<br />It was just before sunrise<BR>When we started on traditional roles<BR>She said sure, I'll be your partner<BR>But don't make toomany demands<br />-Cold Fire<br />What kind of lyric are these?  I even heard them play Sun And Moon live and it was horrid!  It's amazing the lyrics Niel has penned and the worlds and moods he's created and this was what he came up with.  It boggles my mind...  They don't even sound jocular or humourous even...<br />This is without a doubt the bands WORST album they ever made (at least so far).  I even say it's worse than Caress of Steel because at least with that recording they 1) tried something creative and imaginative 2) were pressured to get the record out before they were even ready.<br />Only buy this album if you are a huge fan of the band and need to complete your library.  THat being said make sure it is the LAST Rush album you buy.  If anything go out and get the next album they released after this album 'Test For Echo'.  That album is basicaly what Counterparts would sound like if they did it right, it blows this album out of the water!

B00003CXHJ|1.0|This is a very ordinary (and no more than that) WW2 submarine film.  In the 1950s it would have been a B-movie; special effects are better now, of course, so it's a 'blockbuster'.  It barely merits one star, but the system won't allow none at all.  But that's not the point, of course.<br />The worrying thing is the revisionist history it contains.  We are getting used to it in Britain, but Hollywood constantly rewrites history to favour the Americans, and often at our expense.  &quot;The Patriot&quot; was disgraceful enough in attributing to 1770s British troops atrocities committed by WW2 Germans against French civilians (at Orodour), but at least Hollywood was trying to establish in blatant terms who was &quot;good&quot; (Americans) and who &quot;bad&quot; (British) for the purpose of the film.  &quot;U 571&quot; goes further than that, because it rewrites history to give credit to people who do not deserve it, and by implication to take credit from those that do.<br />It's the feeling that some people don't think this matters that worries me.  Imagine the outcry in the US if anyone made a film showing the Royal Marines capturing Iwo Jima and raising the British Flag.  Or how about how the British fought and won the Battle of the Bulge?<br />It does matter.  Really.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Beyond being extraordinarily visually appealing, this movie reached a place in me.... and lingered in my mind for days.<BR>Imagine that the one person in your life, someone you deeply love, passes away tragically.  Just because they are gone does not mean you stop making memories of them. What you remember of them is only a part of who they really are, however, and your memories grow and change shape as the years go by.<BR>This movie explores questions of love, how love can go wrong, how it leaves a void when it's over, and mostly, how our memories of someone are not the same as who that person really was.  These questions are never directly present, but hidden in the dialogue between Chris and Rheya.<BR>Anyone looking for a Sci-Fi flick will be dissappointed at the methodical, calm pace of the movie. Someone looking for a love story will be dissappointed by the personal boundaries in Chris and Rheya's relationship.  But some people, maybe those who have been touched by the death of someone who has had a profound effect on their life, may find that this film takes them to a place that others either cannot go to, or choose to avoid.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I don't know what everyone is gripping about.  Sure, there are a few slow songs, and Cory sings a little more, but this album is still filled with more intense metal than from any other band out there.  If you don't like the 4 slow songs, skip over them.  I personally think every track is amazing, but don't get confused and think that the album is all weak.  Most of it is right on-line with the old stuff.
B00003CXDG|2.0|It seems like 95 percent of the movie is in slow motion. Every so-called action scene is slowed down to a crawl. When the action scenes are slower than the parts where people are just standing around talking, you know it's a bad movie. The behind the scenes action footage of M:I-2 was much better because it was at normal speed. If you hate slow motion, avoid this DVD.
B000001GY9|5.0|I live in a part of America where the PBS classical programming director loves the Schumann symphonies and schedules a different recording 2-3 days a week while I listen via Internet stream. They are so ridiculously overscheduled a coworker and I send e-mails to each other announcing the obligatory &quot;Schumann hour&quot; has commenced for the day, in case one of us should miss it. Ergo, I have heard most of the famous and infamous versions of the Schumann symphonies, including a couple of Lenny's New York recordings. I don't think Schumann was a great symphonist (he certainly was not a great orchestrator) and I don't believe, all things considered, that his four symphonies stand up to the quad of Brahms, the Mendelssohn five, Tchaikovsky's half-dozen, the nine of Beethoven, Mahler and Bruckner, the 15 of Shostakovich, or even the 3 from Rachmaninoff. Well, maybe they're better than Rachmaninoff. But you'd never know there were any limitations by listening to these glorious CDs from Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic, whose concertmaster said the 1984-85 collaboration resulted in some of the most memorable recording sessions of his lifetime (all &quot;live&quot; by the way...meaning not dead?) It is easy to hear that enthusiasm on these CDs. Bernstein, who could be too loud, too fast, too indulgent and just about too everything except timid, seems to me more perfectly mated to Schumann's manic-depression than just about any conductor in history. For once, Lenny's overindulgence seems perfectly at home...when it comes in the beginning of the &quot;Rhenish&quot;...or in the return of the first movement's big subject in &quot;Spring&quot;...or the drama of the Fourth Symphony's concluding Lebhaft. I thought Lenny got everything just right in these recordings. He played up the schmaltz each time it was nearby and it always sounds wonderful, evocative and appropriate. That's something I could almost never say in his other Vienna recordings, which have been reissued by DG. His Beethoven symphonies, in particular, were in my view regularly marred by exaggeration, ill tempo or inappropriate tenuto. But those gooey effects seem to enhance the drama and schizophrenia of the Schumann symphonies. I don't know another conductor who could do such a sympathetic job with the symphonies of Robert Schumann.by DG.

For me, the highlight of the movie was Kevin Spacey's appearence as the murderer. He's brilliant in the part, even though he's only in the movie towards the end. It's nice to see a movie thats original instead of being a carbon copy of many others. Very entertaining.
B000008H1U|5.0|I remember buying Crest of a Knave when it first came out, giving it a listen, then shelving it. Nothing really caught me at the time except &quot;Farm on the Freeway&quot;. When &quot;Rock Island&quot; came out I pulled out &quot;Crest&quot; again, and for several weeks it stayed in my CD player. I couldn't get some of these songs out of my head, and Ian's flute work is haunting on this disk! Tull rebounded so well after the days of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;Under Wraps&quot; with such a musically strong album I was amazed. &quot;Budapest&quot; is a modern classic that holds up so well against classics like &quot;Hymn 43&quot; and &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot; and &quot;Teacher&quot;. If you haven't heard &quot;Crest&quot; or only know the album because of it's Grammy win, then you should definately pick this up. This is the best of the 80's Tull, and alongside &quot;Catfish Rising&quot; and &quot;Dot Com&quot; is the best of modern day Jethro Tull. If you haven't heard Tull since &quot;Aqualung&quot; days then you have to get &quot;Crest&quot; to hear how the band has matured and grown, and for under $4 you can't go wrong.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I can't believe this girl is only 14!!! She sings with the soul and conviction of the masters of yesterday's blues, Jazz, and soul. She commands attention when singing live, and has the voice of gold. Get this CD, it will be big real fast!!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|ALL OF GUNS N ROSES BEST SONGS ARE ON THIS CD. ALL OF MY FAVORITES, SUCH AS ''WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE'' AND ESPECIALLY, ''NOVEMBER RAIN'' ARE ALL REMASTERED AND THEY SOUND BETTER THAN THEY EVER DID BEFORE. GUNS N ROSES ARE UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE BEST ROCK BANDS TO COME FROM THE 80S, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. FOR ANY FAN OF GUNS N ROSES WHO IMMEDIATELY WANNA GET ALL THE HITS WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT UP A LOT OF MONEY TO GET THE ORIGINAL ALBUMS, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE WAY TO GO. ROCK COULD DEFINITELY USE THESE GUYS TODAY!
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie is, without a doubt, the best cinematic adaptation and closest rendition of J. M. Barrie's timeless, ageless fantasy tale about the boy who wouldn't grow up. It's simply perfect from beginning to end. It stays true to the book, but also incorporates a few fresh ideas, that take nothing away from the original story.  The actors are superb. Jeremy Sumpter is wonderful as the carefree, adventurous, cocky, yet innocent, Peter Pan, and Jason Issacs perfectly portrays the elegant, sophisticated, obsessive and downright bad Captain Hook. Rachel Hurd-Wood is excellent as Wendy, sharing with us her fears, desires and fantasies as she faces the choices that go hand in hand with growing up. The acting of the rest of the cast, especially the children's, is impressive, and the chemistry between them and the adults shines through on the screen.  James Newton Howard's score is simply magical and seamlessly woven into the story and the film's stunning and splendid visuals.  Even the special features are great, as they are presented in well-organized, short, little capsules that make them enjoyable and easy to watch even for children.  This is the first live-action adaptation of J. M. Barrie's classic, and is such an excellent one that it should remain so for a very long time. It masterfully combines adventure, romance, action and drama with fantastic characters, making it a must-see for both kids and adults. You won't be disappointed.  --Reviewed by M. E. Volmar
B000003TA4|1.0|Modern-day Elvis? Hmmm, let's see... Elvis was paid by the president and hired by the White House to be an official narc (he even got his own official ID badge), Elvis didn't write even ONE of the songs he \\"performed\\", and Elvis was basically a media-[prostitute]. Yep, that describes Cobain to a T. Cobain was just a puppet for the media. He was the \\"safe alternative\\" to musicians that actually made people think. There was nothing threatening nor re-inventive about Kurt Cobain and Nirvana, and that was their problem. He tried to make things threatening that shouldn't threaten people. Sure, Kurt said he supported homosexuality, but he tried to make it look like it was a radical, \\"new\\" thing for rebellious people when it is as old as imperative to some types of people as long as man has been on this earth. The right to be that way is a basic human right, and all Kurt did was try to make homophobes even angrier by spiting them by kissing Krist on SNL in order to promote this Nevermind album.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|After about 2 years of songwriting, Avril's new album is finally out. This time she wrote it with friends, instead of a proffesional songwriting team like she did on the last CD, and that means that<BR>'Under My Skin' is more like Avril wants it, it's &quot;more Avril&quot;, and that's a positive thing. You can easily see that Avril is a lot more grown up since last record, both as songwriter and person, and it's<BR>much more serious topics she sings about this time, and then she also plays a whole new instrument on this album, the piano, a instrument that also gives the album a more &quot;grown up&quot; sound. A new and unique record from Avril is out, and she will definantly get a bunch of new fans to her fanbase with 'Under My Skin'.<br />~ [...] ~
B00000K3D4|5.0|Okay, now I remember seeing this movie when i was really little (im 15 now so it wasn't that long ago...haha) because my mom is a huge David Bowie fan. I liked it, and thought the songs were cool, but now as i go back and watch it, I see the wonders of the Labyrinth.<BR>There is just something about the muppets, even though some are hideous because they have to be....they're goblins, that amazes me. This was done mid 80's and it looks fantastic! When you first see Hoggle, the dwarf that helps Sarah along the way, he isn't an immediate favorite, but by the end he's the most loveable little dwarf ever! Forget about the hobbits in Lord of The Rings! I much rather prefer these muppets. The big, but still loveable Ludo has the same feel. But the one that gets me cracking up hysterically (well it actually is two) are Sir Didymus (i like to call him &quot;Little Fox Dude&quot; haha) and his dog, that acts as a horse, Ambrocous. It's HYSTERICAL to see him taking on Ludo and popping out of every little corner! I love it!<BR>The scenery is incredible as well. I especially love the one part where you see David Bowie's face in rock, and it seems like it's just one big statue, but because things are never what they seem in the labyrinth (huge creatures that are kind hearted, a little fox that will take on a hundred-goblin army all by himself) the camera pans around and you see that there are multiple rocks that from facce on seem as one. Amazing for the 80's!!! <BR>Now onto David Bowie. I guess the hair and outfits aren't for everyone. Personally, I love him in this movie. The hair is so amazing, especially in &quot;When the World Falls Down&quot; when he has the tiny blue streaks to match his outfit. Personally, I love seeing him in the tight pants...it was the 80's!!! But there is always something extravagent about each outfit that can take away from the pants, if that's not your cup of tea. Like the wonderful jackets (once again, especially in &quot;When the World Falls Down&quot;) and make-up...nothing better than a guy that looks fabulous wearing make-up!<BR>There is the once scene though, that still boggles my mind. It is when Sarah gets to the Labyrinth and is trying to get to her little brother. There are random stairs everywhere. You see a shot of Sarah on the top side, and David Bowie on the bottom, all at once, and then From the bottom, Bowie swings around to the top. It is amazing! If you don't like anything else about the movie, this scene is sure to blow you away. I also love other things like the near misses between David Bowie and Sarah, and the end when he is begging for the baby. For a few seconds you feel bad for Bowie..well Jareth...and how hard he tries, until 5 seconds later you realize he really is a bad guy.<BR>It's a wonderful movie!!!

But- remember this:<BR>thousand years ago the Church splitted for Western and Eastern and one of the reasons was...interpretation of a line in the Bible... and it happened because one small coma changed the whole meaing of the sentence.<BR>It is worth to know how to use punctuation.<BR>It is worth to use it well.<BR>About that book- GOOD JOB.
B00009RAJI|5.0|In a way, the remastering seems like a marketing ploy to make more money, to promote the second leg of their national tour (it amazes me that they could still be touring- it's like trying to imagine my parents running around the country from city to city playing rock music every night.  I can't.).  <BR> Yet, I think it's also an effort to present the music to their fans on CD as it was originally recorded.  The pre-existing CD versions are definitely sub-optimal- the transfer from the analog recording is flat and smoothed over.  When I heard Rumours remastered, I almost started crying- in fact, I might have.  It was clear and vibrant, the vocals had so much more depth, and the instruments stand out from one other- and the singing rises from the music rather than being plastered to it.  This is the way it was meant to be listened to.  This is the reason Fleetwood Mac is a blues/folk/*rock*- and not pop- band.  I can hear vocals and sounds that I never ever heard before- it's just so intense.  Definitely worth it
0800141601|1.0|This is one of the most historically inaccurate movies I have ever seen.  It is certainly the worst King Arthur movie that I have seen. I can not believe how bad this film is.  King Arthur was a fairly young to middle age guy, but Sean Connery is in his 70's and looks like it too. The other Knights of the Round Table were also about the same age as King Arthur, but in this movie they<BR>are  of wildly different ages.  The acting is generally poor with several of the actors being just plain wooden.  The script is pretty bad too.  <br />One of the worst aspects of this movie is the costumes and acting.  All of the clothes look brand new and there are a number of instances where clothes that get dirty in a battle suddenly and mysteriously get clean again even though the characters are still on the battlefield.  Evidently the actors could not stand wearing dirty clothing.  Back in the days of King Arthur, knights wore chain mail instead of plated armor.  <br />The final word:  avoid this flick at all costs.
0312958455|5.0|I loved this book. The Bosch series just gets better and better.  I have come to really like Harry.  He is so real.  He is a great cop but he makes mistakes. The interesting thing is, he realizes it and always tries to improve on it while he continues to fight the demons that haunt him from his past and present.<br />My advice is, if you are going to read the Bosch series, start from the beginning (Black Echo). Each book pulls from the previous ones regarding characters and story lines. That's what makes these books so good. This series ties everything in and gives closure at the end.  It makes you want to read the next one...right away.
B000002UA5|5.0|Here's the bottom line-if you've only heard floyd's radio hits and are curious to discover the rest of their albums this one's definatly not for you.(unless you enjoy drugs or very trippy music)I would get \\"meddle\\",\\"more\\",or \\"piper @ the gates of dawn\\" if you're just curious.these are all albums that are every bit as good as the popular one's like\\"the wall\\",\\"dark side...\\",\\"animals\\",ect.<br />however,if you happen to be a floydianatic like my brother and myself these cds cannot be passed up!the album artwork is awesome,it's been remastered,and I enjoy the fact that it's a two cd set.(I actually find myself listening to this more than the 2cd wall album because it consists of so much more intricate musical tones.there's LOT'S left to the imagination,and you'll pick out somthing interesting in the songs each time you give a close listen.it never gets old!)even if you're not a fan of what some folks call \\"noise rock\\",you'll still enjoy putting it on as an alterative to sleeping pills-and have some quite strange dreams as well!<br />so the bottom line is;get this album if you're into the weirder floyd,stick to the radio hits if not(because you'll hate the fact that it's strange,unfortunatly for yourself
B00000FC5H|5.0|If I could give this CD more than 5 stars I would.  I'm 23 and my mom (43) and grandma (63) were on a road trip listening to the CD.  All of us LOVED it.  This is the greatest CD of all time.
0066214122|3.0|If you don't have time to read Crichton's new novel \\"Prey,\\" drive over to the neighborhood video store and rent \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" a 1970 movie based on Crichton's early novel of the same title.  The story lines are essentially identical-virulent agents are released into the atmosphere and wreak havoc on hapless humans in their paths until the agents are (presumably but not definitively) destroyed.  The old story features alien biological microbes that continually mutate through a deadly pathogenic form into a benign form that escapes from the lab and  disappears over the ocean, while the new story features molecular level machines engineered through human nanotechnology.  The old story has the malevolent agents intentionally brought to earth via a military research satellite while the new one has them intentionally released from a laboratory in an attempt to force their evolution into a form desired by the researchers.  If there is anything new in \\"Prey\\" that was not in \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" it is the contribution that corporate greed makes to the near-destruction of humanity.<br />The resurrected three-decade-old plot still plays well in its new attire as a fun story intended for nothing more than escapist reading.  Crichton does include an introduction that attempts to give the novel the appearance of a social commentary, warning that humanity may be developing technology that it is too ignorant to control.  So what's new?  Humanity did that back in the 1940's with its ill-starred development of nuclear weapons.  Certainly, there are novelists writing in the science fiction genre who provide outstanding commentary on the human condition.  Zenna Henderson (author of \\"The People\\") comes to mind as a prime example.  Crichton, however, is not one of them, nor does the bibliography (an unusual addition to a sci-fi novel) turn \\"Prey\\" into a serious examination of technological versus social progress.<br />Underneath its veneer of social commentary, and despite its repetition of a thirty-year-old story line, \\"Prey\\" emerges as a simple excursion into a brief but entertaining fantasy adventure.  After something of a slow start, the story begins picking up its pace until the reader is fairly running along with the unfolding events.  Now and then, a repetitious comment does appear, and the occasional commentary on algorithms and nanotechnology research does put on the brakes, but by and large the story forges ahead at a seldom-slackening pace.<br />The ending is not totally satisfactory.  Whereas, \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" pretty well assures us of the natural destruction of the mutated microbial cloud, leaving only the smallest doubt in the mind of the viewer or reader, \\"Prey\\" leaves quite a few loose ends flapping about. We are left wondering if our hero/protagonist \\"Jack\\" is entirely rid of the infesting nanogizmos, if his children have rid themselves of the little buggers, how his sister even got exposed, whether Mae has the good news that her smile suggests, ands where the heck Bob Woodward is to expose all of the corporate evildoers (at least those who haven't died) on the front page of The Washington Post.  Look, real life is full of loose ends, but when we read an escapist fantasy like \\"Prey,\\" we want those ends nicely tied up at the end.  Oh well, the book should make for a marvelous \\"grade-B\\" movie script, and I'll probably even pay to see it-but not at theater prices.  This will be one more  movie that will have to come out on cheap home video before I'll spring for the admission price.ts repetition of a thirty-year-old story line, \\"Prey\\" emerges as a simple excursion into a brief but entertaining fantasy adventure.

6305127646|4.0|Short story: Val Kimler makes this absolutely worth it.<br />Long story: Yes, it may be a weak throwback to the notorious Saint comics and all that. So what. The movie is modern, stylish and always keeps you on the edge with its elaborate pseudo-politics, intriguing ideas and rehashed romantic mishmash.<br />Whenever it starts to drag Kilmer turns up in a new disguise and that alone carries the film through to its next thrill. Not to mention that the chemistry between Shue and Kilmer is hot enough to sizzle a steak.<br />Add to that mix a high-octane Prodigy-induced sountrack and you've got a fun flick with an exciting roulette of action and suspense.<br />Highly recommended rental.
B000002V07|5.0|this is an awesome cd!I'd compare hope sandoval(mazzy star's singer)to julee cruise or kim gordon(at times),and the music is definatly reminicent of the first two julee cruise albums.it has a subtle &quot;misting&quot; effect that sweeps through you and makes you feel what she feels.my favorite track is the one with the slide guitar on it.fans of dark tones and affectionate vocals should eat this right up!
0440237688|5.0|Read this book in English class when I was in 7th grade and I really liked it but was deeply disturbed at the same time while reading it.<br />The Giver is about a utopian society that practices \\"sameness\\" and is really dull. It has no color, no diversity, no feelings, no weather, nothing whatsoever out of the ordinary. People who aren't perfect, people who break the law and the old are \\"released\\" from the community to go on someplace else.<br />The main character is selected as \\"The Reciever of Memory\\" and thus starts his difficult journey as \\"The Giver\\".<br />The author of this book, Lois Lowry put a huge amount of thought and philosphy into this book and also won an award for it. I would highly recomend reading this book, and it is part of my Permenant Collection.
B000002KBU|5.0|There have been arguements over what was the greatest year in Rock and Roll history. Some will say 1964, others 1967, 1969, 1975, 1991, 1983, 1968, or even 1977. But for me 1971 is hands down the greatest year ever. Just look at the albums that were released: <br />Led Zeppelin-LED ZEPPELIN IV<BR>The Who-WHO'S NEXT<BR>Carole King-TAPESTY (Amazingly, won Grammy for Album of the Year)<BR>The Rolling Stones-STICKY FINGERS<BR>Rod Stewart-EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY<BR>Traffic-THE LOW SPARK OF HIGH-HEELED BOYS<BR>John Lennon-IMAGINE<BR>James Taylor-MUDSLIDE SLIM AND THE BLUE HORIZON <BR>Chicago-CHICAGO III and AT CARNEGIE HALL<BR>Elton John-TUMBLEWEED COLLECTION and MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER<BR>The Altman Brothers Band-AT FILLMORE EAST<BR>Carly Simon-CARLY SIMON and ANTICIPATION<BR>Yes-THE YES ALBUM <BR>Alice Cooper-LOVE IT TO DEATH and KILLER<br />And at the heart of these remarkable landmarks was Joni Mitchell's BLUE. What she does to the songs CAREY and CALIFORNIA are truly amazing. There were a couple of X factors as to why I think '71 is the greatest ever: It was the first full year that there wasn't a song by The Beatles and it marked Rock's unsolved mystery with the mysterious demise of The Doors' Jim Morrison(Did he really fake his death in Paris to escape prison like what happened to Roman Polaski?). Could it be possible that the incident inspired Mitchell to write &quot;Free Man in Paris&quot; three years later? (&quot;But for the work I've taken on/Stoking the star maker machinery/Behind the popular song) Above all, BLUE was the beginning of what made Joni Mitchell great.
6304806442|5.0|What an ensemble. Great actors crawl out of every cut in the film to deliver stunning performances. The film takes several non-trivial gambles in handling pithy social themes: social junkies in the throes of drugs' harrows, AIDS, crib death, personal betrayal etc.<br />Yet, the film is not a deadbeat documentary. With its  tongue firmly planted in one cheek, it employs glorious wit and a razor sharp narrative to drive home other points. For instance, ironically, the movie's most pathologically twisted character is not a substance abuser but an alcoholic who never touches drugs.<br />The thick Scottish accent lends that mildly comic cadence to the affair, and this is where the subtitles come in handy. It takes a while to get used to, but when you do, you realize that the script is topnotch.<br />Not to mention, the uncannily perfect compilation of popular music from Iggy Pop to Blur to Underworld. Sumptuous!<br />NOTE: This DVD that I am writing the review for is a simple one, with just the movie. Thankfully, there is another &quot;director's cut&quot; version that comprises two discs, including a making-of documentary, retrospective, interviews, and a multi-angle feature. Deleted scenes and a feature length commentary round up the extras. Try getting hold of that one if possible to include this truly grand movie from the 90s into your collection.

B00005JMX4|4.0|OK, this movie is self-indulgent, immature, unrealistic... But a movie doesn't have to be inspiring and realistic to be good. When you view a movie like this you're hardly expecting to see a heavy classic, but that's because this movie didn't set out to do that! IT'S LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT, GET OVER IT! Escapism, pure fantasy... sure this sort of thing would not happen in real life but does that matter? No! This isn't a classic but it fulfills everything it set out to do. It is entertaining, the acting is great from the main three, the script is amusing, the music is well chosen, it looks nice...for want of a better word. It is a highly enjoyable movie, give it a chance! Plus Elisha Cuthbert is so amazing looking it is untrue...
B000002JS0|5.0|Sono in pochi che riescono a produrre un album d'esordio di tale potenza e non c'era neanche da dubitare che gli AC/DC fossero uno di quei pochi, da questo cd, infatti non sono poche le canzoni che tutt'oggi sono dei must ai concerti degli AC/DC. Ecco la lista delle canzoni con il mio parere:<br />1) It's a long way to the top (if you wanna rock'n'roll): Canzone che non poteva meglio aprire questo cd, anche se Bon poteva risparmiare di suonare la cornamusa. A<br />2) Rock'n'roll singer: canzone un po' rioetitiva, ma tutto sommato divertente. A-<br />3) The Jack: Una delle migliori canzoni scritte dagli AC/DC, Il ritmo lento e grottesco fa un tuutt'uno con l' atmosfera notturna di una partita a carte in un pub. Il primo solista è quanto di meglio possa offrire una canzone in pieno stile blues. A+<br />4) Live wire: l' inizio in crescendo è una figata, come tutta la canzone, del resto, ma la parte più bella è il solista con un accompagnamento spaccaossa. A+<br />5) T.N.T.: questa canzone è un po' ripetitiva, ma colpisce il ritornello dove il coro sembra quasi metallico! A<br />&amp;) Can I sit next to you girl: La canzone più rock'n'roll dell' album, ma, a differenza di Show business in '74 Jailbreak, questa è più originale e riesce a prendere di più. A<br />7) Little lover: una delle 2 ballad scritte dagli AC/DC: centro! Atmosfera molto romantica e sognante che fanno di questa canzone un capolavoro. A+<br />8) She's got balls: Ora vi racconterò un piccolo aneddoto riguardante l' origine di questa canzone: la fidanzata di Bon, lamentandosi perchè lui non le aveva dedicato nessuna canzone, dopo aver ascoltato la sua &quot;dedica&quot;, cioè She's got balls, non ne volle più sapere del nostro povero Bon in veste di fidanzato! Molto divertente il ritmo. A<br />9) High Voltage: La miglior canzone del Cd. Unica ed irripetibile. Cos' altro si potrebbe aggiungere? A+<br />Lunga vita agli AC/DC!!
B00005JKHP|2.0|I'm probably going to hack a few people off but...<br />I grew up with this movie; both the theatrical release and the \\"Special Edition\\" Laserdisc. (God, I'm old) This is ALMOST my favorite movie. Having watched this movie so much and having studied all the character development in it, some might say this makes me bias.<br />If you don't mind having dialog removed; scenes switched around; and generally questionable editing for the sake of time and new special effects, then you'll love this version.<br />I was VERY disappointed in the \\"Director's Edition\\". Don't get me wrong. The new special effects; WONDERFUL; like the new San Francisco scene. Cleaning up the visuals; EXCELLENT. I even overlooked what he was trying to do with the music.<br />I am, however disappointed because the director took a perfectly fine movie, (the Original &quot;Special Edition&quot;) and BUTCHERED it. Granted, it's his movie. He can do what he wants. I just wish he'd have asked folks like me before he took a blade to it.<br />Scenes, which gave this film such character development, were cut out. Background noise showing what might be \\"real life\\" on a Starship, edited out. The noise level in the new version is almost like a morgue. The energy and tension you feel, while the crew is preparing the Enterprise against an impossible deadline, is non-existent.<br />The computer translation, of the Klingon language transmission at Epsilon 9, was edited out.<br />Little shots that gave this movie feeling were edited out. Such as, the shot of Uhura, staring in disbelief at the view screen, and Kirk having to REPEAT HIMSELF to turn the, \\"Viewer off!\\" to shake her from the horror she had just witnessed, was edited out.<br />The snip of Kirk blowing off McCoy saying, \\"Get out of here, Bones\\" was edited out. Kirk was ignoring what he'd done to get this new position. He wanted to ignore what he should face.<br />A scene showing the absolute power Ilea, as a Deltan, has over the human male, with Sulu stumbling all over himself, was cut out.<br />A shot of Ilea, staring longingly toward the turbo-lift door, as Sulu is trying to get her attention, was cut out. This scene showed how she was dealing with seeing Decker again, without having to utter a word. GONE.<br />While Kirk and Bones are talking to Spock in the lounge, the Director STUCK a CGI warp engine in the background. It looks amateur.<br />The editing on the Enterprise fly-over was poor.<br />The editing on the V-Ger fly-over was poor.

B00003CXFV|5.0|Julia Roberts is my favorite female actress of all time, she never seems to let me down on a movie.  I think the story is extremely motivating.  The movie is about a middle aged, divorced, mother of three that takes on a multi million dollar company to make them pay for families living in a town that was affected by dangerous chromium.  Based on a true story I thought the movie really portrayed the good in a person and to what extents they were willing to go to in order to try and help a total stranger.  Everyone that is a fan of Julia Roberts or not should watch this movie.  Inspirational!
B0000UJDLM|1.0|I almost did not finish the film because Fisher Stevens' East Indian character Ben Jabituya was very annoying (It brings to mind such annoyances as Chris Tucker in THE FIFTH ELEMENT...and Jar Jar Binks doesn't seem so bad after all!). SHORT CIRCUIT is another attempt of filmakers in the 80's trying to do Disney type family films due to the success of E.T. An experimental robot is struck by lightning at an electronics lab dealing in artificial intelligence/robotics.  It then takes on a life and personality of its own taking on the name &quot;Number 5&quot; (it's actual numerical name from a bunch of experimental robots of its class).  Then (surprise!) the military gets wind of it and wants to destroy it (how many movies have we seen this plot device!). Then the race is on to save it..him.  If Steven's/Jabituya character is annoying, the Robot is even more annoying once it starts talking and sprouting pop culture quips fed to it by humans thinking he's an alien.  Overall, a film that has a couple of laughs with a fish-out-of-water theme along with some pathos to make the audience take out their hankerchiefs.  However, in the end we really don't care about anyone in this film.
B000002U8G|5.0|this is the best pink floyd cd to not have a radio hit on it.period.if you're into floyd,this cd is one you will hear and then say&quot;why did I ever buy the other albums before this one?!&quot;it really is that good.buy this,and the watch the live performaces of &quot;one of these days...&quot; on the dvd &quot;live @ pompei&quot;-you'd have to be eathier braindead or a green day fan to not be completely satisfied with it.
0790729628|2.0|Blade Runner starts out slow and dreary, and ends with a depressing killing spree, knee-deep in moral (and storytelling) ambiguity.  The film depicts a society where value of human life is very low. The technical gimmick of this film is the use of made-to-order disposable human laborers (with built in expiration dates).  When there's a sensitive or dangerous job to be done--make a few slaves, give them the memories and training they need to do the job, and dump them in the recycle when  the job is done. But what if they want more out of life... or just a few more years of it?    This film is not exactly family viewing, and it's too nasty to keep in my collection.
B00005JLYW|3.0|From the get go CHARLIES ANGELS FULL THROTTLE pays homage (or rips off) a scene from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK; the Mongolian tavern scene. This is right down to the \\"who-can-drink-the-most-whiskey-in-the-shot-glass\\" scene made famous by Karen Allen (as Marion).  This 'wiskey'scene with Drew Barrymore (as Dylan) is identical almost frame by frame. Some of the Mongolian locals look like the same patrons from 'Raiders'.  This is a very loud and (sound effects and music sountrack included)in your face movie as the girls seem to be thrown and beat up all over the place, then resilient enough (like the proverbial cartoon character) to bounce back into their headquarters,land on the sofa, smile, and wait for their next assignment from Charlie (voice only by original John Forsyth). The plot is somewhat recycled as their assignment is to recover a set of rings that hold the lists to the FBI's Witness Protection Program.  Then supervillians get in their way including a rogue 'Angel' played by Demi Moore. There is one moment of sweetness as Drew/Dylan gets some advice from a former Angel (Jaclyn Smith)in a dream sequence. It would have been really been great to expand her original role and the roles of the other former 'Angels' from Farrah Fawcett,Kate Jackson,Shelly Hack, Cheryl Ladd, and Tanya Roberts. However, with the way this movie plot action moves along, they all would end up getting oft probably anyway.  Luke Wilson and Matt LeBlanc are in thankless roles as two of the wimpy boyfriends and John Cleese is wasted as the befuddled father of Alex (Lucy Liu). Bernie Mac is lost as 'Bosley' in a very underwritten role. All in all, a loud and crass actioneer throwing a fashion music video show in the mix.  It may either take your breath away, or leave the viewer with a big headache.  As for pure popcorn adrenalin this is the movie to watch.
B000002UA2|5.0|this is a great floyd cd.it's weird how the instrumental tracks actually outshine the ones with vocals,however.any fan of pink has to hear the song &quot;mudmen&quot;-one of the most relaxingly uplifting songs ever by anybody.it's just an all-around classic pink floyd cd with no filler cuts,and no egotistical crap.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Can't add much to what has already been said - but had to throw in my 2 cents.  This is THE best thing that has been on TV  EVER.  My entire family got addicted after renting the DVDs - and I just bought the entire set cause we plan on re-watching them A LOT.  Like some previous reviewers, I don't watch tv as a general rule.  This, however, gives hope for the medium.  More, Mr. Whedon, more!!

B0001NBMBC|2.0|After the insanely brutal first album and the twisted glory of Iowa, Slipknot return with what is arguably one of my biggest disappointments in recent years.  There are bands where you expect them to swear and be twisted and while there are decent anger songs on this album, there is also far too much pure singing:( Also, there is absolutely no swearing, with the exception of a few damns...whoopee! c'mon Corey- i wanted the next &quot;f&quot; it all,&quot;f&quot; this world, &quot;f&quot; everything that you stand for...there are some good, catchy songs on this album that you will want to listen over to again but, Slipknot are supposed to be angry, swearing nutcases-and don't give me the reinvention stuff- because although that definately worked for Korn:), Slipknot is (was) definately more heavy then them...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I absolutely love this album!  It has a ton of great dance tracks and some beautiful mid-tempo songs and ballads.  Whatever you like, there's definitely a song for you on this album.  It's a full-length listen and it never gets old.  Amazing album, period.
B00020HEL6|5.0|THis is just a wonderful c.d. by a young girl who can belt them out like the best of them.  This c.d. will be another great add to my collection.  David Foster has got some gift, he only finds the best voices in this world.  Thank you for bringing another one to our lives!!!  Michael Buble, Renee Olstead, my god, it can't get any better than this!!!!  David, you will never be able to top these two young people's voices, you have already set the bar with them.  Congrats. to you on these amazing talents.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm really impressed with &quot;In the Zone.&quot;  It's a great album all the way through and there's a bunch of great dance tracks.  If you're feeling down, it'll definitely lift your spirits and make you want to get up and dance.  I play it at parties and the reaction from my friends is always extremely positive.  The best tracks are probably Toxic, Me Against the Music, I Got that Boom Boom, Outrageous, Breathe on Me, and Touch of my Hand.  There's also some really pretty ballads on it, Everytime &amp; Shadow.  I highly recommend picking this one up, it's well worth it.
B000088E6D|5.0|I get chills everytime I listen to this voice!!! What an amazing album this turned out to be.  Can't take it out of my player for fear of going through withdrawls.  This is a must have album for those of us that love to hear a fantastic singer, who gives us one great song after another.  Can't wait till he comes to my area, as a hear his show is an experience one never forgets.  Thank you Michael, you bring me joy each and everytime I listen to you.  I am looking forward to his next album, which I've read will have some of this amazing talents own songs.... Bring it on!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|after i read some of the reviews on this site, i expected this album to be bad.  however, a friend had me listen to her copy and i was very impressed.  there's really nothing i didn't like on the album.  there's some great pop and techno-sounding songs on it.  i especially love 'touch of my hand' and 'breathe on me.'  i have to say i was extremely impressed and didn't expect something so good from britney.  i'm sure you'll feel the same if you give it a listen.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I have to say I always *hated* country music with a passion, but I guess I was just listening to the wrong brand of country music--the &quot;new&quot; stuff they play on the radio these days. Well, I just heard Johnny Cash and I can't say that I dislike country anymore.  <br />Johnny Cash is like noone else I've heard in country. He brings a rough and tough edge to many of his songs that is nonexistent in most country where they just sing about their pickup trucks or how their &quot;daddy&quot; taught them some lesson.  Half the time they're just crying about some lost love.  Maybe Cash does a little bit of this, but not much.  He really makes all the other male country artists sound like a bunch of pansys. San Quentin, I Walk the Line, Folsum Prison Blues, Wanted Man, and The Man Comes Around are my favorites.
B00006J3WH|4.0|This cd is a must for anyone who loved the episode entitled \\"Once More with Feeling\\" - and who couldn't in their right mind?  Joss Whedon's homage to the all of the great musicals is pure genius.  Placing an old school musical in a campy tv series for the under 30 crowd was a stroke of brillance that he masterfully pulls off.  I mean, who'd think this could work with a cast of mostly non-singing actors?  Well it does and there are three songs (which correspond to singing capabilites) that really stand out: Tara's \\"Under Your Spell\\" (the proclaimed break away pop hit - it's a love song), Spike's \\"Rest in Peace\\" (a done-me-wrong love song with a hard rock edge) and Giles' \\"Standing\\" (a classic rock/folk tune about love in the paternal way).  Everybody else pulls their own weight and the whole cd is eminently listenable.  I bought this cd even before I saw the episode and now it's only that much better.

B00008J4P5|5.0|You can listen to this cd over and over and it just keeps getting better.  I love the heavy catchy beats and lyrics.  The great thing about this compilation is that not every song is the same.  Unfortunately, most groups tend to have the same sound present in most of their work and if you've heard one hit you've heard their whole repetoire.  This duo doesn't stick to just one formula and you never get tired of listening to it as a result.  Some standouts were:<br />Seven Nation Army;<br />There's No Home for You Here;<br />I Just Don't Know What to do with Myself;<br />In the Cold, Cold Night (Meg White sings);<br />You've Got Her in Your Pocket;<br />Ball and Biscuit;<br />The Hardest Button to Button;<br />Little Acorns; and<br />Hypnotize.<br />Since that's 9 songs out of the 14, how can you really go wrong?

0553583182|3.0|Unless you enjoy reading several case stories in every chapter, of people who he has met or maybe even made up, then this book is not for you.  Most of the stories in his books I have found, after buying several books of his, is that he likes to use case stories to explain his concepts and to me they don't interest me enough and they don't always work for me.  I prefer a simple step by step procedures (i.e. (1) Place x in y (2)Take x and do this to it (3)Finished .  There must be a 90%-100% cause and effect relationship of the procedures in a book, meaning that if you do (A) then (B) will always result. If you do (A) and expect (B)to happen and it never happens, then it fails and should not be published. <br />For example in his books he recommends saying some words, phrases, or verses or to think a certain way, and then your life will get better.  Fortunately, I have taken some philosophy courses in college, and well some things can't be changed with your thoughts.  If something is wrong, something is wrong, and you can't think that it's right and that will make it right.  For example, thinking the Earth is flat or the sun rotating around the Earth doesn't change those things.  We sometimes have to conform our way of thinking to certain natural laws that exist.  I am afraid that it will take more than what he is prescribing for certain things to happen in one's life and the MAIN PROBLEM with these concepts is that he does not give a  time duration, meaning if I do what he says in the book, how long will it take for me to get the desired results (1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day, 1 month, 1 year). <br />The one positive thing I would say about this author is that he helps steer people in the right direction with the attitude that they should generally have towards others and the negative things I would say about his writing is that it's too wordy, too much redundancy, and uses case stories when I think he should use step-by-step procedures.  <br />This is just another make you &quot;feel good&quot; authors out there.  If I could recommend one thing that authors should do in their books, and this might be because they are trying to reach a general audience rather than a specific person with their specific problem, is to (1) make sure this stuff actually works before publishing it (100% cause and effect relationship) and to (2) keep it simple by putting the procedures in a step-by-step format, making it easier for readers to remember, understand, and perform with success.  When the steps are simple they are easier for the readers to follow and remember, and please NO REDUNDANCY (to save me some time from reading something similar), unless the redundancy is used for emphasis or repeated in the summary section.
0743454529|5.0|This book compelled me to write a review for the first time.  I've ready other novels by Jodi Picoult before but this one was the best.  It's definitely a page turner and now that I've finished it, there is a sadness in my heart.  I wish it wasn't over!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I like the album OK as workday headphone soundtrack fodder, but have a hard time identifying it with Slipknot. I appreciate that they've grown and matured, sure, and would advise as such that they do what others in the past have done: come up with a different band name to release this body of work under. I came to Amazon to see if the copy I'd procured over the weekend was edited as there isn't a single colourfully violent or vulgar thing on it. Hate to sound immature, but that to me is what separated this group, the raw intensity of the word and the sound. Well, and the cool masks, too. After such a long wait for an album, and after discovering that no, there isn't an alternative version, well, I just wish I had more of the old instead of the new; a new album that went about raising the stakes on the previous two just the way Iowa raised the bar over Slipknot. Not a lack of evolution, just a logical one, a chaotic, violent and beautiful one. Past albums' radio tracks were generally not my first playlist picks, and here they go and make an album of nothing but radio friendly answers to the trend that began with Motley Crue's &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; or Poison's &quot;Rose&quot;. Disappointing and sadly average thus. Still, the old albums will remain some of the best music to build 3D &amp; design game worlds with, and maybe this crew's next effort will be back on track for the fans. Not the first group to do a soft album, look at Killing Joke's &quot;Brighter than A Million Suns&quot;, Static X's new one (ugh), Fear Factory's one last year (the dull one). Pretty much any group with the legs to do multiple albums will drop a lame we've grown up and gotten introspective. Just wish they'd warn the listener of same instead of having a zipper mask cover that seemed to promise hard core musical decadence. Should've had a picture of a guitar sitting in a field by a Joshua Tree.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Since my family is going to Italy this summer, my father had us watch Roman holiday because of the setting and all of the landmarks shown in the movie.  It was my first Audrey Hepburn film, and it definately will not be my last.  In this ligh hearted tale, a princess of a European country becomes fed up with her duties and sneaks out to enjoy a day in Rome, where she soon meets, and falls in love with, an american reporter.  This movie is incredibly charming and very romantic, with one of the saddest endings that doesn't seem all that sad.  I would recommend it to everyone, regardless of age or movie preference.
B000148KK2|2.0|When talking about this album, I think of a tortured analogy once used by CBS commentator Andy Rooney, something like, &quot;I like women's hair.  I like butter. But I don't like finding a strand of women's hair in my butter.&quot;  Well, I love Diana Krall.  I admire Elvis Costello.  But the combination of Diana Krall and Elvis Costello doesn't work, and her willingness to collaborate with her husband indicates that, at some level, she doesn't understand what makes her a great artist.<br />Jazz is not about lyrics in the way that many rock performers think of them.  Elvis Costello's lyric writing is firmly in the tradition of Bob Dylan--wordy, poetic, complex, allusive, clever.  It has more in common with T.S. Eliot than it does with Cole Porter.  For performers in the Dylan tradition, music often takes a back seat to the lyrics.  Thus, it is uncommon to find a jazz performer covering a Bob Dylan tune.  But it is very common to see a Bob Dylan lyric published as if it were a piece of poetry.<br />A great lyric in a pop standard adheres to a totally different aesthetic.  While it can be clever, it can't be something that you need to read on a piece of paper in order to understand.  But those are the kinds of lyrics that Elvis Costello specializes in.  Sometimes, he can be absolutely brilliant. But he's also capable of being frustratingly dense, and too many of his collaborations with his wife on this album fall into that category.<br />Krall's music to accompany these lyrics suffers from some of the same problems that Costello's music suffers from--an excessively artful wandering from recognizable melodies, a forced quality where it feels like her reach is exceeding her grasp.  Not every song is equally bad, but overall, you hear these collaborations and feel no desire to hear them a second time.<br />Fortunately, there are a few tunes on this disk that redeem it, and almost make it worth buying.  Her take on &quot;Stop This World&quot; by Mose Allison is a great direction--I think more blues from Krall sounds like an excellent idea.  And her version of &quot;Love Me Like A Man&quot; is a tour de force.<br />Diana Krall is a world-class jazz artist who combines the pianistic skills of an Oscar Peterson with a vocal style that is utterly unique.  She is a brilliant intepreter of the jazz/pop standards, and her interpretations have created new standards.  But she is not, nor should she try to be, an avant-garde artist, an auteur like Elvis Costello, or a synthesizer of disparate styles.reat direction--I think more blues from Krall sounds like an excellent idea.

0375703764|5.0|This book scared the hell out of me - and it's about time! For so long I've been looking for a &quot;scary&quot; book that is actually scary and not just totally unrealistic and comical. This book had me looking over my shoulder when I was home alone reading it at night, and gave me nightmares even after I had finished it. <br />It's about perception, as well as the biggest horror of all - ourselves. Our emotions, ever-changing and unpredictable, like the house itself. Our hidden depths. The darkness within us. The characters were well-developed - I especially liked Karen Green, as I could relate to her. They are believable because they are humanly flawed, complex, and three-dimensional, unlike most characters in horror or sci fi books, where there are &quot;good&quot; guys and &quot;bad&quot; guys. <br />The book uses scientific explanations for the phenomenon of the house, like physics, as well as psychological and mythological comparisons. It is experimental in the way it is presented, with the diagonal writing, break-ups and footnotes, pages with only one word on them - which leaves you on the edge of your seat flipping the book in all different directions desperate to read what happens next.<br />The ending does not disappoint. There is no unbelievably happy ending like with Koontz novels, but a realistic one.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD shows a great deal of growth, and it's nice to see that Lavigne wrote some of her own lyrics/songs, or at least played more of a role in doing so. This CD is more of a \\"life soundtrack\\" then her last album (not to mention I enjoy it more). I especially liked \\"Slipped Away\\", that was really beautiful and it is even more beautiful because she makes it known that she composed it for her grandfather who passed away. <br />As for the actual songs, \\"My Happy Ending\\" and \\"Don't tell me\\" are catchy but I think that \\"Slipped Away\\" is my favorite on the album. It makes me cry because a few years ago I too lost someone close to me. <br />&quot;Under My Skin&quot; is an impeccable disc. I suggest you go buy this CD and enjoy it.
B0000019PA|5.0|The catchy opening strum does not prepare you for the ensuing journey of lush melody, incredibly beautiful arrangements, heartfelt and heartbreaking lyricism and vocals to follow. This album made me happy to be alive to hear it from the first time I played it. Mangum's lyrics read like the most bittersweet, complex and vivid poetry. Rarely does a songwriter achieve such parallel heights with the lyrics, the unique and gorgeous music, and the vocals. This lyric from the title track has always struck me as particularly sweet: &quot;how strange it is to be anything at all.&quot;
1920769005|5.0|This book really makes a big impression. The characters are unforgetable, the pacing is exciting and sustained and most of all the narrative has a very authentic quality to it. Assuming that much of this experience is autobiographical, then to say the authors life has been intense would be an understatement.  He has lived a few hundred lifetimes in the span of ten years.  Well worth reading.
B00005JN0A|5.0|I liked Eurotrip. I seen it twice at the show and would give it three or three in a half stars. The extras you get on the DVD push it over the edge. There are over a dozen deleted scenes, most are really funny (probably should have been included in the film). God, how I wish they included the European O.J. commercial. Just thinking about it makes me laugh.<br />Besides the deleted scenes, there are just so many extras with this DVD; I'm shocked to get so much for twenty-bucks. I counted fifteen special feature menus and most of them are actually entertaining (rare in my opinion). The best extra is probably the bootleg copy of &quot;Eurotrip&quot; they put on the disk: &quot;we just bootleged the bootleger, so -you pirate&quot;.<br />If you liked &quot;Eurotrip&quot; you'll enjoy this DVD. Even if you didn't care for it, or were on the borderline, you should consider picking it up. All the extras make this a whole new experience. If nothing else it will show you how little you really get with other DVD titles.
B00006EXCC|4.0|This is a seminal Rolling Stones document for a number of reasons, the most important being that it is the first Stones record without any cover songs. Every single track is a Jagger and Richards composition (any other contribution from other band members was generally not credited). It is also the first record that finds the Stones moving away from the blues and embracing more pop and rock elements. It also features Brian Jones in his new role as multi-instrumentalist. Mick &amp; Keith may have taken control of the band he started away from him, but Jones was still a mighty powerful musical force within the band and improved upon every song through the use of sitars, dulcimers and other exotic instruments.<br />There are a number of differences between the UK and US versions as well. The US version added the single \\"Paint It Black\\" and left a number of songs off (which made their way onto the throwaway LP Flowers). The UK version features 14 songs instead of 11 and was how the Stones originally intended it.<br />Highlights here include the misogynistic masterpiece \\"Under My Thumb\\", the equally misogynistic \\"Stupid Girl\\" (which is not to say that the anti-female tone is what makes these two tracks great), the Motown-ish \\"Out of Time\\", the romantic ballad \\"Lady Jane\\" (sandwiched between \\"Under My Thumb\\" and \\"Stupid Girl\\" no less!), the folky \\"I Am Waiting\\" (used to great effect in the film Rushmore) and the absolutely brilliant \\"Mother's Little Helper\\". Some of the other tracks are not the Stones strongest cuts, then again, they aren't the Stones at their weakest either. At least they were attempting new things. 1966 was a year where popular music took great chances. The Stones would not be the icons they are today if they had rested on their laurels and continued to regurgitate sounds they'd already mastered two years prior. Of all the Stones pre-Beggars Banquet output, this is probably the best (though some would argue for Between the Buttons). I highly recommend it to those of you who wish to delve a bit deeper into the Stones discography
B000002LBH|5.0|take a listen and you will be hooked on this great collection of singles and b-sides from one of the most influential bands of the 1980's: the Smiths. Of course, the Smiths aren't for everyone and of course they were never meant to be.<BR>Of all the great great bands to come out of Manchester the Smiths are certainly one of the best, as tracks such as \\"panic\\", \\"half a person\\", \\"william it was really nothing\\", heaven knows i'm miserable now\\" and \\"ask\\" certainly attests. <BR>In addition to the unforgettably smooth voice of Morrissey, the guitar accompaniment of Johnny Marr helped elevate the Smiths from a great band to, perhaps, one of the best ever. Listening to the tracks on this album one is struck by the seamless way that Morrissey's voice merges with and into the music of Marr, Rourke and Joyce, all complimenting each other beautifully as the music meanders through subtle and at times dramatic shifts in rhythm, melody and tone. Combine this mastery of harmony with lyrics that are often intense, provocative and always impassioned one can see why the music of the Smiths was so appealing to so many disaffected by the culture of alienation and isolation that has become one of most recognizable hallmarks of the 80's.<BR>While many mainstrem bands and performers were mindlessly celebrating the escapist world of sex, drugs and rock n' roll, the Smiths were providing a voice for all those who could see that such excess was simply a symptom of a cultural milieu awash in greed and blind conformity. If you think Van Halen is \\"cool\\" or think that owning a porsche makes you a somehow \\"better\\" or more \\"complete,\\" then this is probably not the music for you, however if you are one of those people who loves music with depth, passion and more than a tinge of melancholy, well this IS for you. \\"Yes, we may be hidden by rags, but we have something they'll never have, and if people stare, then, the people stare, I really don't know, and I really don't care\\"
B00000D9TQ|5.0|When I heard about Phil Collins' Hits coming out in fall 1998, I went so crazy, I bought 4 copies of it on the release date!!!! All those songs and classics by Phil put together in one collection!  I know someone must have played In The Air Tonight on repeat maybe 56 times on the CD player because he can make such hummable songs!  Lots of melodies and rhythms and songmaking that he's so good at!!!!  Against All Odds, Another Day In Paradise (which I can't stop humming to!), Two Hearts, Something Happened..., One More Night, Sussudio, and others were those I loved on there.  One overlooked song he should have put on it was Do You Remember and its South Carolina/Georgia like feel to it (it just sounded so good in Augusta in '90). But this is a very smartly done collection of songs that highlighted his decade long solo career!
B00005T30L|3.0|From the very beginning, the eccentricity of \\"Ghost World\\" had me hooked. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansen) are two high school graduates who are breaking the mold by not attending college. Instead, they plan to live together and torment the pathetic suburban neighborhood that they live in. While Rebecca takes a job at a coffee shop that is begging to be called Starbucks, Enid is forced to go to summer school to earn credits for an art course that she flunked. The two collect retro knick-knacks, play off-beat music, and haunt 1950's diners. Their angst-ridden but amused camaraderie, however, is shattered when one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. After pretending to be the long lost \\"blonde girl at the airport\\" that a lonely man has placed an ad in the \\"personals\\" section to look for, Enid finds herself a soul mate. Seymour (Steve Buschemi) is a significantly older man who is awkward but sweet and sensitive and loves the same music and culture that Enid does. <br />Gradually as everyone's lives shift around her, Enid finds her own splintering apart. Her father is contemplating marrying a repulsive former girlfriend. Seymour finally finds his \\"lost girl at the airport\\". Enid herself cannot keep a job and ends up flunking her art course, losing the chance to obtain a scholarship to an arts school. Even worse, Enid's relationship with Seymour alienates her from Rebecca, who is more interested in saving money and picking out apartments. Ultimately, Enid realizes that her only hope for salvation is to indulge one of her deepest fantasies and simply walk away from the life she has known.<BR>I started out really liking this movie for its quirky, off-beat characters. Apart from Enid and Rebecca themselves, there is Josh (Brad Renfro), the cashier at a local quick-mart, whom the girls alternately torment and flirt with; Josh's crazy martinet of a Greek boss along with his archenemy red-neck of a customer; Allen \\"Weird Al\\", the cook with the crazy hair atthe 1950's diner; Norman, who faithfully waits for the bus although it was canceled two years ago; Enid's obnoxious, freaky art teacher; even a cameo by a man so lazy he requires a wheelchair and spends his time looking up the answers to trivia questions in the coffee shop Rebecca works at on his laptop. Enid's father is also by turns amusing and sympathetic as her well-meaning but stuttering father. Seeing Thora Birch continue her masterful portrayal of teenage angst after \\"American Beauty\\" was delightful. However, I found one of the final plot developments outrageous and quite bizarre. Seymour and Enid were, as far as I could see, just friends. I did not view them as being anything else and felt that adding this dimension to their characters did not fit with Enid's personality as being cynical and aloof from typical human passions. Therefore, I was pretty disappointed and a little freaked out towards the end, although the final scene is somewhat believable. This is one of those movies where you just want to delete one or two of the scenes and pretend they never happened and let the rest of the movie go on as it is. Overall, worth watching simply for its hilarious caricatures of cynical high school graduates and suburbanites.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Ahh... Who hasn't heard of Avril by now? If you hadn't heard of her, obviously you have been living under a rock. Avril's first album I had bought wasn't what I expected, it was full of many pop tracks. Her newest album although, is much much better, although it could have some work on the lyrics, her voice and guitars are awesome.<br />Take Me Away- A good song, not the best, but I like it. 8/10<br />Together- A very very good song, but same comments as Take Me Away. 8/10<br />Don't Tell Me- Avril's first single on this album. In the beginning it's sort of pop-ish, but then it gets better. One of my favorites. 10/10<br />He Wasn't- Sort of like Sk8ter Boi, but I enjoy this song a lot. Also one of my faves. 10/10<br />How Does It Feel- I don't like this song that much but it has a pretty good message. 6/10<br />My Happy Ending- One of my favorites, it's really well-written and the music and Avril's voice is great. 10/10<br />Nobody's Home- Personally, my favorite track on the whole album. The message isn't like any other song, it's unique and has a good beat, music, and Avril's voice is excellent. 10/10<br />Forgotten- Very rock/goth sounding... Very very excellent, one of my faves. 10/10<br />Who Knows- It's an alright song... Not the best, but it's okay. 5/10<br />Fall To Peices- Also another one of my favorites, it's very well-written and has a nice soft rock tone to it... I love it. 10/10<br />Freak Out- A fun song to listen to, talking about having fun in life and enjoying it. It has a good message and great guitars, Avril's voice is good too. 10/10<br />Slipped Away- A nice way to end the whole album with a slower song, then getting faster. It's talking about missing someone special, and a nice soft rock song. I like it. 8/10<br />If you're an Avril fan, or a fan of rock/pop, you'll enjoy this album. Fans of her first album might be slightly dissappointed because of the more mature sounding rock, but you'll enjoy it as well. Personally, I loved it.
B0000UJL96|5.0|Nick Meyer's &quot;Undiscovered Country&quot; is a terrific movie which involves witty dialogue, a terrific plot, great special effects (for that day and age), a complimentary score by Cliff Eidelman, and surprisingly good acting. I was only eight when the film was released in '91, but when they special edition DVD's were released, I decided it would be best to buy just my favorites, and this one is on the list.<br />Why? Well, the script takes you for a good ride for close to two hours and never lets up - I mean never. There aren't many scripts that can do that. What impressed me the most is the acting. The actors aren't the same, campy, over-dramatic ones which they were claimed to be during the run of the television series. These are actors that pretty much know that this is the last movie in the franchise that made them stars, and they give down to earth and funny performances. It's almost like five grandparents and a grandma acting, with all that wisdom and wit. Shatner's performance was the greatest. This isn't the actor that released a horrible CD and is still impersonated - this is William Shatner at his best. Christopher Plummer is also incredible as the villain Chang. The trial scene is a great piece of acting for him.<br />True, the premise is based on the post-Cold War collapse of Russia, but isn't this how Trek was started after all? The Federation was NATO, the Klingons were Russians, and the Romulans Japanese? Roddenberry took our world, made races out of countries, and boom, we have &quot;Star Trek.&quot; Many people who believe that &quot;Trek&quot; is unrealistic must do is look to our history to believe how wrong they are. Either way, this movie is a fitting sendoff that features the crew, and is what I believe right up there with the second movie as one of the best.
0451191153|4.0|The protagonists- Howard Roark and Dominique are an embodiment of every conceivable other worldly impractical ideals. At the end of a decade of struggles in their lives, Howard and Dominique are given a fairy tale like \\"they live happily ever after\\" ending. If anything, I would consider Howard to have been extremely lucky in getting away with being an architect who considered his clients to be guinea pigs for his creative ideas. <br />Howard's statements in his own defense at the final trial, in which he draws a comparison between the creative human spirit behind the first use of fire and that of his own experiments in architecture, are contemptuous. In my opinion, Ayn Rand could have show-cased her philosophy of objectivism more effectively by grounding her story in some other profession which has a more direct impact on people's lives than in the field of architecture.<br />In summary, I found many parts of the story defying common sense and what emerges from the book is the mindless quest of two cold individuals who want to have their own way in the world, oblivious to whether they fit into the larger interests of society and in the process willing to subject themselves to  adultery and violent schemes-all in the name of pioneering human progress. I would still strongly recommend this book for the fun of journeying through Ayn Rand's brilliant thoughts and unbelievable plot.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|How do you sell a movie that has a mediocre storyline?  Add every big name you can, then highlight the fact that Clint Eastwood directed it.  Excuse me, but when was Clint Eastwood considered an important film-maker?  News to me.  At best, he's an okay actor.  <br />Mystic River has received so many mixed reviews that it's hard to know what to think.  Best advice is to watch it for yourself, like I did, then make up your own mind.  Here goes:<br />Sean Penn is a current Hollywood favourite. He's a fine actor even if he acts the same way in all his films.  But I felt his character was lost in this film, perhaps due to the lack of character development.  Tim Robbins character was more clearly defined, and I enjoyed his performance more. Other big names seemed to have very little purpose in the film (Bacon, Fishbourne)<br />It's far from the intriguing storyline that the film has been marketed as, and does not deserve the amount of nominations it received.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Perhaps those reviewers who found this film to be a disappointment were not as haunted by it as I was. This film was superbly acted and directed, with a fantastic and fitting score to boot. I was completely swept away and carried into the psyche of those on the ship, as intrigued and beguiled by Solaris as the characters (sans disturbing 'visitors'). This film ranks among one of my favorites--it's a great Sci-fi film without teetering toward cheesy, as many tend to do. Leaning more toward the 'psychological thriller' genre, 'Solaris' effortlessly captures the imagination, leaving the viewer to think about the fate of 'Kris' and 'Rheya' well beyond the end of the film. <BR>One caveat: If you're the type that enjoys mindless Hollywood drivel in which every aspect of the plot is explained ad nauseum, underestimating the intelligence of the viewer, then this film is NOT for you.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|First to answer a question:<BR>The song for Oren's entrance is 9- Battle without honor or humanity. I love this one too. Perfect replacement for graduation's Pomp and Circumstance, ugh.<BR>Now to rip Quentin. What the heck are you smoking?!?!<BR>This CD could have been so good. No Urami Bushi, my fav. song<BR>in Vol. 1. Then this guy puts it in Vol. 2. Except he F-it up<BR>by putting this stupid RZA guy rapping on crap into that same<BR>track!!!That's right folks, a beautiful Japanese song, appended<BR>with \\"..my japanese..b***, sucking ***, giving ****\\" in Vol. 2 soundtrack.<BR>The whole reason for the excplicit lyric is that RZA.<BR>Now I have to re-cut Urami Bushi. Thanks Quentin!!!<BR>And if you want a preview of RZAcrap, he's also in Vol. 1 talkin<BR>nonsense.<BR>And if the excuse for vol.1 is \\"there is not enough time in the CD\\", well..why the heck did he put a 10min version of <BR>Don't Let me be Misunderstood? This track breaks the whole CD.<BR>This CD could have been a 5star for me, but this is total screw up.<BR>I'm not dissing the songs, just the coke head making the decisions. and yeah, lose RZA. I know he's your friend, but please. it's totally out of place.<br />Here's my advice. <BR>Get the music, one way or another. But don't buy this CD if you can. Download the songs you want. Borrow from a friend. Or just rip the songs off the DVD. It'll be much better. And you'll remember it just the way it was in the movie. (...)
078322611X|5.0|We all have at least one regret; most of us more than one.  Maybe we said or did something stupid or cruel in a moment of passion, and left an eternal scar on someone we love, someone who loved us.  Life rarely if ever gives us a second chance.  In the words of Moonlight Graham (Burt Lancaster), an old small-town doctor who, fifty years before, got to play in the major leagues for just one inning, \\"...we just don't recognize the most significant moments of our lives when they're happening.  I said to myself, `There'll be other days,' but it turned out that that was the only day.\\"<br />The \\"dream\\" of this beautiful film, is the dream of the second chance.  This theme is common to all the major characters, and by some inexplicable miracle the film pulls it off without ever becoming sappy.  There are a few tiny flaws I could point out, but why?  The film as a whole is such a towering achievement of the metaphysical, of the magical, of the spiritual, that if you are willing to suspend your disbelief even the tiniest little bit, it will take you to places in your soul that you didn't even know were there.  In a strange and almost perfect way, \\"Field of Dreams\\" taps into that deepest and most precious place in the Judeo/Christian cultural tradition - that place where forgiveness and redemption live, and where that which is beautiful and good does not die or disappear, but instead lives forever.  If those who have the courage to love are united by hope, this film is a glimpse of what they are hoping for.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Volume 3 is a very well done piece of work.Its got something for everyone.I was very impressed with the musicianship on this album.This album is probably going to be the one that that will seperate the fans frome the true fans.Those who really truly loved this band from the start will like this one,and those that say they are fans just because it was cool to like them will be sifted out from the rest.I read some reviews from ppl who claim that \\"This Is Not What Slipknot Stands For\\"and they blame the success of StoneSour for the change..Well My question to you is \\"Who Are You To Decide What Someone Else Stands For\\",And there are only 2 songs that have the StoneSour Feel.If they didnt stand for it,they wouldnt have done it.Now With That Being Said I Will give my opinion on each Track..............Track 1 - \\"Prelude 3.0\\" -3.5 stars-When I first put this cd in and heard this song,I was very dissapointed.I thought that this was going to set the tone for the rest of the album....I Was Wrong.But It is a very poor song to start an album off with.   Track 2 - \\"The Blister Exist\\" -5 Stars-Very good music, I love Joeys drumming.Hes one of the best for this type of music.    Track 3 - \\"Three Nil\\" -5 Stars-I Frikkin Love The Guitar Riff In This Song.And The Small Drum rolls at the end of the song are amazing.  Track 4 - \\"Duality\\" -5 stars-This is the first song that has the \\"StoneSour\\"feel to it.Very Good Song.    Track 5 -\\"OPIum Of The People\\" -4 Stars-I liked the guitar Harmonies in this one.And The Way Corey Harmonized his voice in the Chorus is pretty Good.    Track 6 - \\"Circle\\" -5 Stars- Like alot of people who have heard this one,I was completely shocked.This song is the one that will sift out the true fans from the others,especially if it makes it to radio.And it will make alot of people scream \\"Sell-Out\\".I dis-agree strongly.Like I said before,If they didnt stand for it,they wouldnt have done it.This Is A Very Well Done Acoustic Song.   Track 7 -\\"Welcome\\" -4 stars-Reallywasnt anything Special about this song.It really doesnt have any kind of major things goin on.but its still a decent song.    Track 8 -\\"Vermillion\\"-4.5 Stars-I read some reviews of this album and every review praised this song.Although it is good ,I dont think its as good as some of the critics say it is.It does have a great chorus though.    Track 9-\\"Pulse Of The Maggots\\"-3.5 stars-The Song has a cool opening riff but thats about all I liked about this song.it got very repetitive.    Track 10-\\"Before I Forget\\"-5 stars-This is one Of My Favorite songs on the album.This is the other song that has the \\"StoneSour\\" fell to it.The chorus is very good.    Track 11-\\"Vermillion pt.2\\"-4.5 stars-Another song for people to scream \\"Sell-Out\\" to.This is another Acoustic song.Oh No...God-Forbid Slipknot do something differant.    Track 12-\\"The Nameless\\"-5 Stars-This Is an amazing song.It pretty sums up the sound of the whole album,its got its heavy moments and its mixed with some really (dare I Say)pretty guitar work and vocals.    Track 13-\\"The Virus Of Life\\"-4.0 Stars-This song could of been alot better,its just missing something and I cant put my finger on it.    Track 14-\\"Danger-Keep Away\\" -5 stars-This is probably my favorite song on the album.its the type of song that will put you in a trance.I wish this one was longer than 3 min.The Chorus sounds very Alice in Chains-ish.very well put together...................................................................................................................................................................................Although I really like this album I do have 2 complaints.the first is the quality isnt all that good and in some of the songs the music overpowers coreys voice.And The Second Complaint is with 9 members in the band,you really dont hear that much stuff going on...........I Still Think that there firsst album is there best one,But this is a very close second.It is alot better than Iowa.I reccomend this to everyone who is into this style of music,and dont let all the \\"StoneSour\\" remarks turn you away.................................. Stand Out Tracks Are:    \\"Three Nil\\"      \\"Circle\\"      \\"Vermillion pt.1 & Pt.2\\"     \\"Before I Forget\\"      \\"The Nameless\\"
B00000I07P|1.0|This album epitomeses the worst kind of cheese American idolitry, and generally blows big things.<BR>Some of RS's solos are passable, but for the most part - it's standard bad popcorn glam, for over-the-hill women who drink in bars by themselves, and over-the-hill men who always wanted to be American, or popular - but failed on all counts.<BR>For more of this throw-away hamshank trash, see Europe, Def Leppard etc . .
B00000DHRX|5.0|If you are a fan...you must have this collection.  He is a true talent on just about any genre his vocals touch.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Too much Stone Sour influence. I was dissapointed as soon as I started listening to the first track. I don't like Stone Sour so naturally I don't like the sound of this album. I don't like how Cory sings on this album, the guitar riffs aren't as heavy as in their previous recordings, and what happened to the double bass kicking???? Joey used to kick that double bass out so fast and it sounded so awesome but he doesn't use it that much on this album. I don't know. Too much singing and not enough intensity for me. Some of the songs on this cd actually remind me of Staind and I can't stand that band. Slipknot has definatly done better.
B000002HMH|5.0|I think that load is a really great album. The album is just sort of a slower version of what Metallica does and what they are known for. I love every single Metallica album, they are all teriffic. I mean, wouldn't it just be boring to have every single album be the same? Since the songs are slower, it does not mean &quot;they sold out&quot;. I think James Hetfield did a GREAT job on vocals, and I think KIRK did REALLY great solos. In my opinion, if one change in an album could stop you from being a Metallica fan, I really dont think you were a real Metallica fan at all. Everyone has to bad mouth Metallica about everything they do! Its like they sold out for every decision they made! I think people should listen to the album and find the greatness that came out of it! I love all the songs on that album.One of my favorites is &quot;Outlaw torn&quot; because of the singing and the guitar solo( REALLY GREAT!!!!!) check out the album. IF YOUR A TRUE METALLICA FAN, YOU'LL LOVE IT. SO STOP BAD MOUTHING THIS ALBUM!!!!! IT WAS #1 ON THE CHARTS!! ITS GREAT!!!!!!!!
B000000JO3|5.0|Minor Threat is one of the best hardcore punk bands of all time. I would just like to say that all the people that think these guys were posers would probably get their face bitten off at ahow if they said something like this back in the day. This music was made when punk was for punks. This is what it's all about.

0385336810|3.0|I've liked Sophie Kinsella's books as light-hearted &quot;beach reading&quot; for several years, and this one was fun, but she seems stuck in the same formulaic plot rut as she did in the Shopaholic books.  Emma Corrigan is just Becky Bloomwood in a different body, with an obsession for secrets instead of shopping.  This book had a few fun moments, but for the most part it was predictable and more of the same.  I hope Kinsella finds a new plot structure for her next book, otherwise I might move on to more sophisticated things.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne definitely grew up as a performer with this CD. The cliche lyrics that sound like a transcription of anyone's diary into pseudopunk are only present in two or three songs. A lot of the improvement is probably due to the recruitment of experienced pop singer songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk (whose CDs you should definitely check out if you like this one). The MTV teen crowd that loved her first CD will probably not be as tuned: there is more mature stuff in the vein of Losing my grip or I'm with you and less mindless shouting like the one in Sk8r boi. Probably those who have grown along with her and that have outgrown the punk-supposed to be anti-Britney of the first Avril will enjoy this CD more. Also, this CD is more appealing to grown up audiences, the songwriting in some cases is remarkable. I guess that this CD is the first step for Avril to go beyond her ephemeral MTV persona and become a respectable performer. I wish her third CD move more into that direction so she can produce a 5 star album.
1592400876|4.0|Hilarious little book with a decidedly British slant. It's good, but come on: #6 on Amazon? I flipped through it while I was visiting a friends house and got a good giggle out of the witty and instructional little book. The author, a self-proclaimed stickler who has a special aversion to misplaced or missing apostrophes - and provides outrageously funny examples from real life - used a chatty and sarcastic tone to point out common flaws in the way we punctuate the English language. <BR>She makes it fun to be a Comma Nazi, of which I consider myself one.<BR>Definitely worth a read. Not sure I'd spend $ to own it forever, however.
B000002LFU|3.0|The fourth R.E.M. I have owned really was a different one. The three preceding ones I owned (Auto, OOT and Hi-Fi) all have complex, moody songs (ignoring the likes of Shiny Happy People, obviously)... but this cd is all about catchy, radio friendly tracks, and they're guaranteed to put a smile on your face, even if half of the tracks aren't too good...<br />The two opening tracks, Pop Song 89 and Get Up, are both fun pieces of pop... I love them both. They're catchy and they'll stick in your mind, and if you're not into overly complex songs, these will have you hooked.<br />Stand and Orange Crush, the two main singles of this album, are certainly very catchy, though it may alarm some fans of the IRS days (as this is a VERY big swing from, say, Fables...) But I'm sure even they are grinning whenever they play Stand!<br />World Leader Pretend is awesome, period. This is the best track on this album, and it should have got more recognition. I also love the heavier Turn You Inside Out. There's not much to not like about this album...<br />Except the remaining tracks didn't really appeal to me, they seemed a bit dry. Maybe it's because they're not bouncing off the walls like the other songs, but still, You Are The Everything just annoyed me for some reason, and The Wrong Child just leaved me uninspired. The last three tracks are good, but they just don't compare to the better songs this album offers.<br />So what I'm basically saying is that half of this album is great... fantastic even, if you're into the happier, poppier stuff. But half of the tracks just don't really cut it for me.<br />Well, try it out. It's definatly a good album that's worthy of purchase (especially when you consider how cheap it is to buy these days), but be sure to pick up their higher rated albums first, before jumping straight into the Green.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This is a movie for everyone to love. It's a feel-good film without being sappy or dorky. It's about the immigrant experience, about life and death, about risk and faith and trust, about grief and joy. Who could ask for anything more than what this film delivers?<BR>At its heart, it's the story of an Irish couple whose 5yo son has recently died. They and their two little girls slip into NY via the Canadian border and rent a dreadfully skuzzy flat in a the-elevator-hasn't-worked-for-years tenement populated by \\"drug addicts and transvestites.\\" A friendship develops with a dying artist when the girls (soooooo well played by Sarah and Emma Bolger) bang and bang and bang on his door on Halloween - and this friendship slips into a bit of magical realism and becomes the catalyst to help the little family begin healing from the guilt and grief under which they've been trapped for too long. <BR>Gorgeous movie. Don't miss it.
B000002LOE|4.0|This is the first R.E.M. cd I have owned. I bought it when it first came out, and I'm still listening to it since. It is a great cd, full of classic, memorable songs, with surprising cameo appearances. Only a few flaws prevent it from getting the perfect 5 star rating...<br />Losing My Religion is the main song off this album, and it's brilliant, of course. It's a fantastic, catchy song that will have you hooked... that is, if you aren't already!<br />The brilliant Low and Half A World Away occupy this album, both great pieces of music that deserved more recognition. Country Feedback is another great song, and keen R.E.M. fans may tell you that it's one of their best.<br />This cd also contains the single... um, Shiny Happy People. This song has a mixed opinion about it; some love it, some can't stand it. I suppose the same can apply for Radio Song (which I, personally, can't stand.) With &quot;Automatic&quot;, generally everyone can relate to, and love, the songs on it, but with these...<br />As for the others, well, they're a mixed bag, really. Near Wild Heaven is catchy, though perhaps a bit poppy. Endgame is a great instrumental, and the remaining Belong and Me In Honey are certainly good songs, though they are dwarfed by the more popular songs on the cd.<br />So what's the verdict? Well, despite 2 or 3 poppy songs that some people are bound to oppose to, this is still a great album that I recommend to anyone!
0671027387|4.0|This is my fourth Dan Brown novel and while it may not be up to the DaVinci Code's standards, it is a pretty good effort of adventure writing. A president is in trouble in the polls; his opponant is a ruthless SOB who steps on people rather than around them; the opponant's daughter is called upon by the president to go to the Arctic to verify a scientific find of monumental proportions which can have a conclusive impact on the presidential race and this is just the beginning of a chilling story of intrigue, deception, miscalculation and ambition. The reader is drawn along in unraveling the mystery behind the find in the Arctic and then propelled suddenly into a race for revelaing the truth. Things are seldom what they seem and we can all be thankful that this is a true work of fiction. It will hold your interest and picque your curiosity throughout, which is a pretty good trick for any author.
B0001HLVS2|2.0|I purchased this DVD based on all of the hype surrounding the movie and of course Russell Crowe acting in a period piece. After watching this movie I wish I would have saved the purchase for a box of popcorn and a matinee discount.<br />Even Russell Crowe didn't pull in this movie for me despite being a great actor. He is convincing as Captain Aubrey but instead of acting and emoting he does more posing than anything else. Maybe it's because the movie itself had absolutely no storyline to connect the viewers to the individual characters. The sea is beautiful, the Galapagos adventure amazing, the period pieces and ship detail as accurate as I could imagine, but there just is no plot. Two boats travel about a restless ocean trying to anniliate one another over political control, so what! I even rooted for the French in the end because their Captain at least attempted to help an injured Brit while Russell Crowe was busy posing and demanding the loudness of cannons for interest. I was ready to de-board and take in a documentary on the Galapagos Islands, the only really interesting aspect of this film.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Director:  John McTiernan<BR>Cast:  Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedalia, Alexander Gudonov, Paul Gleason, William Atherton, Hart Bochner, James Shigeta, Reginald Vel Johnson.<BR>Running Time:  132 minutes.<BR>Rated R for extreme violence, language, and brief nudity.<br />Fresh of his success with the popular television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, Bruce Willis takes his stab at the motion picture business with full force.  &quot;Die Hard&quot; works on many levels--mainly as an action flick with a powerful leading star that adds a touch of normalcy and humor--but it also discusses more important views such as the criticism of the culturization of Japanese technology that was taking place at the time as well as the horrific, ongoing threat of terrorism.  It s a film that shows just how vulnerable any business or workplace really is to a terrible force but also how one man can stand up to the challenge and ultimately make a difference.<br />John McClane (Willis) is a New York City cop who travels to the Los Angeles area to reconcile with his seperated wife (Bonnie Bedalia) and family, who left him to pursue a lucrative job with a Japanese financial industry skyscraper.  While participating in a Christmas Eve party, the building is overtaken by German terrorists who want to use the hostage Japanese executives to break into the company safe.  McClane watches as the head terrorist (played brilliantly by Alan Rickman) blows the brains out of the Japenese CEO realizes that the game is on.<br />With the help of a gun-shy cop (Reginald Vel Johnson--yes, that's right--Mr. Winslow from &quot;Family Matters&quot;) and to the annoyance of police chief Paul Gleason, McClane runs around like a chicken with its head cut off attempting to save the hostages.  While on the explosive one-man war, Bruce Willis plays McClane in a very believable, humorous fashion--which is the quintessential reason for the film being one of the best of its kind.  &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a non-stop frenzy of excellent action sequences, a superb and witty screenplay written by Jeb Stuart and Steven D. de Souza (adapted from the Roderick Thorp novel), and top-notch, edge-of-your-seat direction from McTiernan.  The Five Star Collection DVD features a deleted scene and some excellent commentary from cast and crew.  One of the best action films of the 1980's.  A superb roller-coaster ride of thrills.
B000002B5L|5.0|With four massive hit singles and 17 million copies shifted worldwide, the Fugees did, indeed, score big time in 1996 with &quot;The Score.&quot; Never before had a rap act ever being so highly praised whilst managing to sell so many records. After 1994's &quot;Blunted On Reality&quot; passed by almost unnoticed, the Fugees pulled themselves together, seemingly matured by ten years and really knuckled down throughout 1995 - the result of which was The Score. Displaying a youthful exuberance fuelled with a wise-beyond-their-years knowledge of urban society, Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill and Prakazrel &quot;Pras&quot; smashed their way into the public conscious and firmly established themselves as one of the most talented and popular Hip-Hop acts of all time. They achieved this all within the space of two years and with one album which would sadly be their last...<br />Inflated egos and a desire to prove their impeccable solo talents (along with scraps within the group) resulted in the demised of one of the most lauded trios ever. What is left is a legacy which we can only hope will be resurrected someday - although with Lauryn (or Ms. Hill as she now prefers to be called) currently battling serious personal demons, the future doesn't look good (I hope that genius brings out another solo album - surely can't be as good as &quot;The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill&quot; though...can it?!). Success, fame and power tore them apart and this album is the only real thing we have left to remember them by.<br />Adopting the alias &quot;Refugee Camp,&quot; the Fugees brought something fresh to the scene in the mid-90's. Their fusion of rap and pop was exciting and very ground-breaking. It sounds not so today, but eight years ago it definitely was - before everyone was ripping it off. The album opens with &quot;Red Intro,&quot; followed swiftly by the classic opener &quot;How Many Mics.&quot; Superb rapping here from Wyclef and Pras inparticular, whilst Lauryn's lyrics bring something new to the song everytime you listen to it. &quot;Ready Or Not&quot; is the now classic massive UK No.1 that rounded off a year of phenomenal success in 1996. Sampling Enya's haunting &quot;Boadicea,&quot; the song becomes a profoundly eerie and dramatic Hip-Hop classic. Mario Winans recently sampled it, but his version pales in comparison to the version the Fugees provide here. &quot;Zealots&quot; has a rather corny chant that plays in the background throughout the song (that, for some unknown reason, reminds me of The Shawshank Redemption!), but the lyrics and rapping arrangement makes up for this and results in another great track.<br />&quot;The Beast&quot; opens with a dragging and throbbing beat that is tired and exhausted. The deep and suffocating atmosphere of the urban underground can be felt completely here and the lyrics are once more superbly arranged and performed. &quot;Fu-gee-la&quot; brings something to the album that has been missing up until this point - a catchy vocal arrangement. With a heavy beat and brilliant rapping, the song effortlessly switches between Wyclef's serious lyrics to Lauryn's fun-loving sung-chorus in that awesome voice of hers. &quot;Family Business&quot; has a distinctive and hidden beat that is incredibly deep and ambiguous, whilst Lauryn's chant of &quot;Ha-ha, ha-ha&quot; in the background is spine-tingling. A great song that is unfortunately forgotten as soon as the next song plays - truly one of the greatest cover versions of all time...<br />Yes, it's the multi-million selling mammoth No.1 &quot;Killing Me Softly.&quot; Lauryn Hill completely owns this track with her tear-inducing voice that caught the ears of millions worldwide. This was the song that made the Fugees international superstars, and Lauryn brings something to the song that Roberta Flack never could originally. &quot;The Score&quot; is held together by a thrilling and haunting beat that breaks down each verse and enhances the choruses, whilst samples from each of the previous songs play to remind you of what you've just heard. &quot;The Mask&quot; offers a metaphorical observation on the identity of people and warns the listener to be aware the false motifs of others, &quot;Yeah everybody wears the mask but how long will it last?&quot; &quot;Cowboys&quot; has a catchy beat with some really truthful lyrics about the dangers of gun crime. A serious topic is perfectly contrasted with Wyclef's hilarious cowboy chant &quot;Oh-lee-i!&quot;<br />The third single to be taken from the album was &quot;No Woman No Cry,&quot; a fantastic cover of the Bob Marley track. The guitar strumming is totally different to anything else on offer on the album. &quot;Manifest/Outro&quot; is the album's final proper track, and the music is hardly present at all. We hear Wyclef teaching us a lesson about his experiences with drugs and all the rest of it, as the piano break from the Intro of the album starts to play. Then Wyclef thanks everyone for working on the album as clapping in the background plays. Kinda funny! The album also has two remixes of &quot;Fu-gee-la&quot; which I'm not really fond of, but apart from that, this is a near-flawless album!<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />At present all is not well in the world of the ex-members of the Fugees. After the phenomenal critical acclaim of her debut solo album and sales surpassing 13 million, Lauryn Hill's personal life has been plagued with many difficulties. Since she met that preacher dude Anthony, I pray that she'll be okay and come out of it, get her head screwed on and bring out another album. I know she's working on one, but she's taking her time - fine by me. Wyclef and Pras parted on bad terms and still don't talk to each other. I think it's a great shame that one of the world's most notorious and talented Hip-Hop acts ever had to end this way. The music on this album is stellar, making it an essential and instant classic - buy a piece of history now.ch of the previous songs play to remind you of what you've just heard. &quot;The Mask&quot; offers a metaphorical observation on the identity of people and warns the listener to be aware the false motifs of others, &quot;Yeah everybody wears the mask but how long will it last?&quot; &quot;Cowboys&quot; has a catchy beat with some really truthful lyrics about the dangers of gun crime.

B00012FXAE|5.0|Director:  James Cameron<BR>Cast:  Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein, Bill Paxton.<BR>Running Time:  154 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<br />As with any James Cameron (&quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;) production, his films are always of epic proportion.  Cameron not only wants to tell a story, but uses many long cuts and extended versions of scenes to draw the audience in and does a fine job of keeping them on their toes.  Perhaps better than no other director, he takes the time to fully set up a film and progress in an exponential fashion towards a climatic, full-throttle finale.  &quot;Aliens&quot;, the sequel to the 1979 hit &quot;Alien&quot;, might be his best example.<br />Taking place fifty-seven years after the original alien rampaged on the ill-fated Nostromo spaceship, the frozen-alive Ripley (played exceptionally well once again by Sigourney Weaver) is miraculously located by a search party and rescued.  She is brought up to speed with all of the changes that have taken place since she was last coherent over a half century ago--including the colonization of LV-426, which happens to be the planet where the original horrific creature was found.  Ripley is worried that something awful is going to happen to the new civilization, so she organizes a hard-nosed team of officers to investigate.  To everyone's surprise except Ripley, the colony has been wiped out, with only the flesh-eating, acid-spewing monsters running around the premises.  While fighting off the dreadful enemies, Ripley befriends an orphan (Carrie Henn) and is driven to get her to safety.<br />The film slightly drags in the first half on hour, but only because Cameron uses this time to give the audience enough information from the previous film in order to catch all those up to speed--then he brings on an onslaught of thunderous action sequences, riveting special effects extravaganzas, grisly nightmare scenes, and a kick-ass finale battle between Ripley and the mother of all aliens. &quot;Aliens&quot; succeeds for many reasons:  the supporting cast, including Michael Biehn as a quiet, yet resourceful commanding officer, Bill Paxton as a smart-alleck private officer who does not know when to keep his mouth shut, and Lance Henriksen as the generous, intellectual android--as well as being a sequel that is informative and stylish enough that it can be enjoyed by those who either did not see the original film or even did not like it.  Sigourney Weaver is given a chance to expand her character--and the sequel takes full advantage in a spellbinding nightmare scene and a few takes with Henn as she is able to show her caring, non-combat side.  The Extended Version has around fifteen minutes of extra footage that gives information about Ripley's daughter and outlines the initial alien attack on LV-426's colonization.  An absolute juggernaut of a film--intense, rip-roaring, and sensational.  A James Cameron classic like no other.  Rivals &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot; as his best action film.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|One of the most consistently interesting female artists of recent years is the amazing Anastacia. Since she burst onto the scene in late 2000, she has been one of the most outstanding vocalists to come out of America. Her success as a female artist in Europe and Australia is rather unparalleled by anyone else - she shifts more records than Jennifer Lopez and Kylie Minogue could ever dream of selling! Her first two albums, \\"Not That Kind\\" and \\"Freak Of Nature,\\" sold a combined total of 10 million copies in Europe alone and were No.1 all over the continent. Despite all this success, the majority of America remains oblivious to Anastacia and her powerhouse voice that brought her to Europe's attention...<br /><br />All I have to say is that they really don't know what they're missing. Here is a lady with the build of Mariah Carey, the voice of ten Tina Turners and praise from legends such as Elton John! In January 2003, Anastacia was diagnosed with breast cancer. The public was instantly sympathetic and Anastacia received much gratitude from her loyal fanbase. Suffice to say, she stood up strong and fought this evil and came out at the end of the year a new woman, which brought her first new material in more than two years. Her third album arrived in March 2004 and became a massive European No.1.<br /><br />The music on offer here is more rockier than ever before. There are clear influences of Evanescence in her music, but she towers above Amy Lee easily. She used to be a soulful diva with a passion for R'n'B/funk classics, but Anastacia is almost a new woman with this album. Her battle with cancer has clearly had it's effects. The album opens with \\"Seasons Change,\\" a fantastic up-tempo rocker that sees Anastacia sing about how life goes around in cycles like the seasons. It's an impressive opener, but nothing compared to what arrives next: \\"Left Outside Alone.\\" As the first single to be taken from the album, this song is just a classic. Opening with high-pitched and haunting vocals, Anastacia soon breaks loose and thrashes her way through this rocker of a smash hit single that has spent more than ten weeks in the UK Top 10.<br /><br />\\"Time\\" is a rather weak spot for me because the song seems to go no where, and is a bit repetitive. However, this dip doesn't last long as \\"Sick And Tired\\" picks things up. As the second single to be released from the album, Anastacia sings of heartache and sadness as a man babbles something African in the background. Anastacia is said to be at her best on powerhouse ballads which have gained her the name The Voice. However, I think she's best at uptempo songs, but I make an exception for \\"Heavy On My Heart,\\" a ballad in which she spills forth her emotion about her cancer last year. Her voice rises into the stratosphere and you really feel for her. \\"I Do\\" is a massive anthemic rocker in a Linkin Park style, but features the vocals of Sonny from P.O.D. Anastacia sings about a crazy world (who can blame her?) that we live in at the moment, and how she wants to pray for a better world.<br /><br />\\"Welcome To My Truth\\" is a true album highlight for me, because it's like a true revelation of Anastacia's personality. It opens like U2's \\"Beautiful Day,\\" and she sings about an escape from dark times as the sun rises, and she sings, \\"Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see. My life turned around, but I'm still living my dream!\\" You go girl! \\"Pretty Little Dum Dum\\" has an awful opening, it's so corny! However, the song itself is rather catchy. \\"Sexy Single\\" is another brilliant song that opens with some really airy and breathy vocals from the backing singers and you just feel like sighing along to them! The beat is brilliant and Anastacia really sells the song from deep down. She's single, happy and freely living her life!<br /><br />\\"Rearview\\" opens sounding like \\"Every Breath You Take,\\" but you soon find Anastacia's growling vocals purring all over the arrangement, stamping her trademark footprintsonto it. The vocal arrangement is very catchy, but in a very mysterious and ambiguous way. The chorus totally kills it though, and makes this one of Anastacia's best-ever songs. \\"Where Do I Belong\\" is the second of only two songs in which Anastacia confronts her trauma of last year. It's a fantastic ballad and is perfectly followed up by the album's final track, \\"Maybe Today.\\" This song is actually rather so-so. It's not the album's best track, but then again it's not the worst!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />I bought this album at the start of April and at first, I have to be honest, I really didn't like it. I really didn't listen to it much to begin with because I was too obsessed with Norah Jones' \\"Feels Like Home,\\" but I've really listened this past week and I love it. Okay, the new rockier Anastacia takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do you'll surely not turn back. America is missing out big time, guys! Buy this album now and see why Anastacia is one of the most celebrated pop divas of the past five years.atchy, but in a very mysterious and ambiguous way.

B00005UK1F|5.0|This entire cd is great... it changes alot, and it never leaves you bored... check it out.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Did you ever see that \\"Love Is\\" comic strip which Homer Simpson once described as about \\"two naked kids who are married\\"?  Love Actually is like that cartoon, just as complex and sophisticated, except smothered in honey and sugar, with a maraschino cherry on top, surrounded by dancing kittens and bunnyrabbits, as cherubs hover in the air humming.  In short, it is so overly sweet and cuddly that it makes you ill just looking at it.  Even if you love romantic films--I mean, really _LOVE_ romantic films--this one is going to make you sick to your stomach.<br />For starters, the music that plays on the index screen of the DVD is the kind of romantic Muzak that accompanies late-night computer dating commercials on television.  Everything else in the movie and on the DVD is just as sappy and overdone.  The film tries so hard that it is scary.  One suspects that the writer and director really have some issues to work out with a therapist--as if they think they have finally discovered true love and happiness after marrying their third wives.<br />The movie is about all the wonderful, mysterious, glorious ways that \\"love\\" enters our lives, and if that description doesn't make you groan, then read some of the blurbs that they stuck on the DVD box (any critic who calls a film \\"the feel-good movie of the year!\\" should be put out to sea in a rowboat with no oars).<br />The movie starts with a narration by Hugh Grant telling us that love is everywhere and the proof is that all those people who made phone calls from the planes hijacked by the terrorists on 9-11 were calling loved ones.  Those were not calls of hate, we are told.  If you think about that a little bit you can see how seriously off-track this movie was right from the start.  Many of those calls were filled with terror and fear, and some of them were not made to loved ones but to law enforcement.  And how can one use this event to \\"prove\\" that love really is all around us when, if anything, those hijackings proved theimmense power of hatred?<br />Besides the overly sentimental and sugary tone of the entire movie, there are some other serious problems with this film.  For one thing, it is too long.  It clocks in at over two hours and clearly doesn't have enough story to support that length.  In fact, there is no single plot that drives the movie from the beginning to the end.  There is no real story, only a bunch of loosely-connected vignettes, each about five minutes long and quickly moving out of the way for the next one.<br />What it has instead is characters, lots of characters.  Way too many of them, actually.  They are all supposed to be connected in some six-degrees-of-separation kind of way.  But this is a contrivance and we only find out that several of them know each other near the end, when they run into their friends at a school concert or the airport.  It's a lame way of saying that we are all connected.  But so what?  The movie would have been better to drop several of them and focus more time on a fewer number of characters that it could better flesh out--and tell real stories about, rather than how they each fell in love.<br />One gets the sense that nobody was willing to rein in this director and tell him that his movie had gotten out of control.  Does he really need that many characters?  Do they really all need to be connected?  Do we really need a cameo by Denise Richards just so that we can laugh at the end and say 'Hey, look!  It's Denise Richards!'?  And why the heck didn't someone tell him that having two actor stand-ins for an adult film constantly mimicking sex is simply _not_ funny?  No matter how hard he tried, the director could not make a couple of naked people making chit-chat on a movie set seem cute.  (One almost has to feel sorry for these two actors, because when the movie inevitably gets edited for television, ALL of their scenes will be the first to go.)<br />In fact, that sense of a runaway production is reinforced by watching the deleted scenes on the DVD.  These are introduced by the director and he reveals that his first cut of the movie came in at about three hours and twenty minutes and all of the scenes that got cut are among his favorites--including not one, but _two_ scenes shot of peasants in Africa proving that \\"love really is everywhere.\\"  Watching them, it's clear that he had little self-control.  One wishes that somebody from the studio had told him to eliminate several of his actors and a bunch of the subplots and tighten the film up so that it had a point other than that love surrounds us, everywhere.<br />I'm not being a curmudgeon.  I enjoy the occasional light romantic comedy (and I liked Notting Hill, which was an earlier work done by the people who brought you Love Actually).  But this movie gives treacle a bad name.
B00005JMEW|3.0|The movie is great! everybody knows that! but to be a Quentin Tarantino movie it have a lot of stereotypes againts the asians.<br />Quentin says that Hollywood movies are the ones that increase the sterotype againts the minoryties, and now he made a movie that is even worst than Hollywood. I know that he wanted to do a tribute to the martial art films, but I mean...<br />. Not every asian people knows about swords, anime, samurais, revenge and killing people with martial arts, for example: The fist time that O-Ren (Lucy) appeared, she was quickly introduced by anime sequenses of Yakuzas killing her family, then she grewn up to be an assasin after avenging her family.<br />. When Uma Thurman arrived in Japan, the only person that didn't know about martial arts and killig people was a lady that sells tickets in the airport.<br />. In Japan, all the people were born with fake blood that comes out like a shower if you get cut and all the americans were born with normal blood.         <br />. If you saw Kill Bill 2 you realize that anything that is not asian is normal. <br />There are many more things but I think that I finished for now. Like I said before &quot;the movies is great&quot; because is packed with action, swordfigthing, good story, so-so acting, great music and interesting characters. I could say that is one of the coolest movies ever since Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction. The movie is &quot;whorth buy&quot; but I think that Quentin could do a great tribute movie without so many stereotype, so let's hope that he doens't make the same mistake again.<br />Thank you for lisening! goodbye and take care.
B00006CXXU|4.0|[4.5/5]<BR>This is an underrated album - hope it will be valued more as time goes by.<br />Go back to her self-titled first album, which was a huge success. That one is ok to listen to, but I can never sing high of it. Calculated tunes, mediocre lyrics,  purely commercial stuff. The major credit is it showcased Aguilera's amazing <BR>voice.<br />This one is totally different. She sings from deep down her heart as promised. There are passion, warmth, strength and a bit fun. Four years on the album and 79+ minutes' music! Not a single filler in the album (although I personally don't like &quot;make over&quot;) in my eyes. It is load and you just feel every ounce of her effort.<br />It continues to show Ms. Aguilera's music strength, Pop(goo pop here)/R&amp;B/Latin, and she really shines in rock (&quot;Fighter&quot;). <br />It is very successful DESPITE her image (some said because of ???). No doubt about the harm done by that &quot;dirrty&quot; video! For those who gave her 0/1 star, did you actually listen to any song in it? (I understand stuff like &quot;get mine, get yours&quot; might be too hard for some conservative minds to digest. I urge you to pass that and open your mind. Don't miss this gem.)<br />Some say Pink will do a equally good job if she were to sing &quot;beautiful&quot;. I doubt that. Pink is undoubtly a good singer, but this song won't be carried through as well by her careless attitude. Aguilera's rendering truly gets the message out fully from this song, her voice just lingers on your heart. You won't be untouched.<br />I am not bothered by &quot;I'm ok&quot;, it is chilly but very touching. Yes I know Pink &quot;covers the same territory with 'family portrait'&quot;. That song rocks but this one gives a different feeling and is in a slightly different tone. It just doesn't sound redundant.<br />Also &quot;The voice within&quot; shouldn't be overshadowed by Mariah's &quot;hero&quot;. It is closer to a girl's heart and just beautiful.<br />Downside is she tried a bit too hard to get her message across - is there a need to both &quot;Soar&quot; and &quot;keep singing my song&quot; ? And because this is a very personal album, it doesn't offer a wider horizon. You'll appreciate it better if you are more interested in her person (I do although I don't applaud her fashion choices) and happily see her growing more mature and not wasting her music gift.
B000001ESF|4.0|just really got into Rush this weekend, when I listened to my Dad's LP copy of Hemispheres. I went out and bought this album, 2112, yesterday. I can confrim, in my opinion, this is not their best, I think Hemispheres gets that honour.<br />one point: to the summary/synopsis review at the op of this page where it says &quot;only Rush could've pulled this off, and only in the 70's.&quot; This album was made in 76. This dude needs to buy an album called &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; or &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; or &quot;Trilogy&quot; or &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot;. I love Rush, but they weren't the first Prog band ever.
B0000026DJ|4.0|That's what this album is; that's what Midnight Oil is about.  There isn't really much I can can do to elaborate on that.  Every track deals unflinchingly with the Aborgines and their place in the modern world.  It's an extremely region- and ideology-specific message, making it all the more remarkable that they ever had a hit stateside (Beds Are Burning).<br />If you don't have the right ideology (i.e., you think the white man is doing a fine job and wish everybody would stop whining), you're not going to like this album.  But if you're open to different, even unpopular points of view (particularly for a subject you might not care all that much about to begin with), this is definitely worth the effort to listen to.<br />As for songs themselves, they're very well done.  The singing is a little rough, but everything else is smooth and powerful.  Not unlike the message, actually.
1576751988|5.0|Everything Brian has to say on taking action is included inside this small book. Mine is heavily underlined, and I regularly take a speed course in effectiveness by skimming through it for half an hour.    Think of it: although we can view an entire week, month or year in our planners, we only actually exist in one point in time. We can only do one thing next. \\"What should I do NOW?\\" is the crucial question we must face. This book answers that question.     You can only do one thing at a time. You want it to be the right thing. How do you decide what the right thing is? Read this book, and you will find out. (Hint: it's probably the thing you are resisting the most).    In virtually everybody's life there is one thing they can do to elevate themselves to a better future. Each of us already knows what that thing is. So why don't we do it? Read this book, and you WILL do it.
0345409671|5.0|This book was absolutely phenomenal!  I own the entire Vampire Chronicles and this is Anne Rice at her very best!  This is by far my favorite book in the series so far.  (I haven't read them all yet).  Lestat is being stalked by something he refers to as &quot;The Ordinary Man&quot; who actually turns out to be the devil himself in another form.  Lestat is stalking a drug lord and at the same time, the devil is stalking him.  the devil introduces himself as Memnoch and takes Lestat on his most extrordinary adventure yet- to Heaven and then to Hell.  Lestat is forced to choose who he will serve, the devil or God or neither one.  lestat meets the daughter of the drug lord, Roger, whose name is Dora.  Dora and Lestat try to help each other and give each other advice.  then Lestat seeks out Memnoch and his newest and most daring adventure begins.  A great book!  I would reccommend this book to any person like myself who is absolutely infatuated with Lestat or Anne rice's novels as she tells her newest installment.  I read it in less than a month when I was 16!  (I'm a very slow reader by the way) and I absolutely could not put it down!  You don't have to read the rest of the chronicles first.  They all seem to be written in no particular order anyway.  Get this book as soon as you can!  It's sensational!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|So Avril isn't the best lyricist.  Lyrics on this album, much like her first, are trite, predictable, and just plain immature.  (But hey, what do you expect?  She's still growing up and maturing herself).  Therefore, if you are a person who cares about deep and meaningful lyrics, this album is definintely not for you.  <br />Despite the poor lyrics, the tunes are quite catchy.  This cd is upbeat and fun to listen to.  I think there is more electric guitar on this cd than the first one.  If you liked the opening song on her first cd (\\"Losing Grip\\"), then you'll probably like this cd as well; many songs have the same level of electric guitar as \\"Losing Grip\\" yet with a little more of an upbeat feel. All in all, I like this cd equally as much as her first, if not a little more.<br />If you're looking for original, earth-shattering lyrics, then stay away from this cd.  But if you are looking for something upbeat and fun to listen to in the car, then this is a cd for you.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have read alot of bad reviews about this album. To tell you the truth I think that anybody that gave this album a bad review is completely tone def!! The only people that would put down a brilliant piece of work such as this album are people that idolize so called artists such as Eminem or 50 Cent. Listen little kiddies Slipknot have matured, something some of you might know very little about considering the majority of you are still are getting allowances from your Mommy and Daddy,and that is the money that bought your new Slipknot album!!!!!<BR>   For most of you metal is just a phase that you are going through, much the same as the hip hop,rap crap phase most of you went through. What I am getting at is the fact that none of your opinions are valid because most of you don't even really know what you like, you just like what's cool at the moment and at the moment it just so happens that Nu-metal is the in thing.<BR>   Please do real headbangers such as myself a favour: leave the hardrock/metal reviews for people that know what they are talking about and go back to listening to your boy bands.<BR>   I mean did you people really think that with Rick Rubin producing the album Slipknot would continue the same dull creative pattern. Are you negative reviewers all retarded or what????<BR>   Listen for fans of true metal(music) believe me when I say that this is by far the best of Slipknot's work thus far, don't be swayed by all of the negative reviews. There is a hell of alot more passion put into this album by the band than in any of Sliknot's previous albums. I love the Idea of Slipknot inserting a few acoustic songs into their portfolio!! The album has a mix of heavy to slow songs. This of course would be Rick Rubin's influence.<BR>   Just give the album a chance instead of being so damn judgemental!!!You never know you might actually like it if you open your ears!!!
B0000399WI|5.0|What a movie.  I have seen it dozens of times.  I have the (now old) DVD.  But even when it pops up on cable, I cannot not watch it.  This film has that truly exceptional touch of magic, that very few motion pictures have.  An absolute gem of a film, that has taken its rightful place alongside classics, in my mind, such as Casablanca.    The performances--all of them--are magnificent.  The cinematography is rich, life affirming, encompassing, and colorful.  The screenplay is in parts positively sublime;  Red's (Morgan Freeman) dialogue in the last five minutes of this film reduces me to tears and fills me with such a well of emotion that I have to go outside for a walk and hug the first stranger I meet.  An absolute clinic in non-simplistic and direct screenwriting that keeps it simple and truthful.  And the direction of this film is fantastic.    This is not just a truly great film, it is also a necessary one.  The values it discusses and the emotions it conveys are in short supply in today's world:  love, patience, perserverence, trust, loyalty, sensitivity, truth, and compassion.
B000002GVO|5.0|THIS MAJESTIC ALBUM FROM THE EAGLES IS MY FAVOURITE MUSIC CD AND I CAN LISTEN TO THIS MASTERPIECE ANY NUMBER OF TIMES WITHOUT GETTING TIRED OF IT.I GIVE THIS TERRIFIC CLASSIC MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS AND WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THIS A THOUSAND STARS.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I thought she was a real lightweight before I heard this.  Good bouncy rhythms and some good lyrics too.  I just keep listening to it.  No it's not hooky enough for pop and it ain't real heavy - just pretty good rock.  If you like this try Liz Phair's latest, Avril sings better but both bring new songs to an old genre very pleasently. I think this one's going in the car 'changer with Liz, Oasis, Rjd2, eminem and some Air (for calming me in the jams).
B000056N8X|1.0|Reviewer: Lisa from Las Vegas, NV United States<BR>I never watched the original movie or Highlander 2 or 3, but HELLO?!!! What were Christopher Lambert and Adrian Paul thinking in consenting to work on this movie? I'll take other reviewers' word on the butchering of Connor MacLeod's character, but I can attest to the butchering of Duncan's. Duncan MacLeod killing his wife? The boy raised to be clan chieftain, raised to protect those in his care, killed his wife? Duncan MacLeod married? Even though &quot;Darkness&quot; (season 2) specifically stated he never married and never would? Duncan asked Tessa (his lover of 13 years) to marry him in that same episode. Darn, if she hadn't died we could have added bigamist to his resume. How about &quot;In the end there will be only one&quot;, yet Duncan and his immortal wife walk off at the end of the movie. So, is he going to kill her or allow her to kill him? I seem to remember other problems, but I have been trying to block this horrible movie from my memory and refuse to watch it ever again. I gave it one star because there wasn't any lesser option.
B000084T18|5.0|nice album. i'd like to say that mikkymouse is an idiot. i'll just bet that he's a white boy. always slangin', dissin good rappers. 50 cent's album is great, w/ in da club and 21 questions. witchymouse is just mad cuz he can't break on to the scene like 50. pick it up. you will like the album. and look for me. on sunfire records. my album might hit it big.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is fantastic !!! I've heard it 20 times for the first month. &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; and &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; are the best!
B00000DLUV|5.0|It's not often that a Live album can cement the title of &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, but clearly in 1998 the Bee Gees' effort on &quot;One Night Only&quot; merits a share of my choice for Album of the Year.    The Bee Gees who were nearly 30 years into their career came together for a 1997 Pay Per View Las Vegas concert entitled &quot;One Night Only&quot;.   Before this effort, the Bee Gees had only moderate success as a performing group following the incredible success on the heels of the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; era.  This particular performance by the Bee Gees caught them on their &quot;A&quot; game putting together a concert of innovative, powerful and inspiring music.<br />The Bee Gees open the concert with a segue between the old and new.  They start off with their most dynamic song of their career - &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;.  Without a bunch of remixing, you will come to appreciate this classic in a whole new light being performed live.   Listen especially to the percussions on this song.  You'll also hear crowd noise which the CD does a great job at not making too overbearing.   Following &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;, there is a nice segue into one of their newest songs called &quot;Alone&quot;.   The segue is perfect and is one example of bridging old and new nicely.<br />After the &quot;You Should Be Dancing/Alone&quot; segue, Barry Gibb says &quot;...shoot back thirty years....and bring you up to date slowly but surely&quot;.  Thus a series of older Bee Gees songs &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, &quot;Words&quot;, and &quot;Closer than Close&quot; go back to the older years of the Bee Gees.  The Bee Gees won't perform songs in chronological order, but by going back to the Bee Gees early stuff at the beginning of the performance, it sets the table real nicely.   I wasn't as familiar with this material by the Bee Gees, but after hearing it, I did come to appreciate things better.<br />The Bee Gees make use of modern technology in a couple of areas.  One is to perform a live &quot;duet&quot; with their late brother Andy Gibb.    The title of the song is called &quot;Our Love (Don't Throw It Away)&quot;.  In this song, the Bee Gees make use of some tracks that Andy recorded when he was alive and put some of their own live tracks around it (very similar to what the Beatles did with John Lennon on the &quot;Anthology&quot; album with  &quot;Real Love&quot; but in this case the Bee Gees do it live).   I happened to watch the video of this concert and you can see the emotion on Barry Gibb's face thinking about his late brother as he sings &quot;this losing you is real, though I still feel you inside&quot;.  On the CD, you will also feel Barry's heartache and true emotion as he sings those words.   It's really powerful stuff.    The other area is a &quot;duet&quot; with Frankie Valli to sing &quot;Grease&quot; which is a song that the Brothers Gibb wrote.    The Bee Gees perform a live version of &quot;Grease&quot; and in the middle of the song they put a recorded track by Frankie Valli. (who sang the version of that song for the movie back in 1978)   Although Valli didn't perform live with them, they do an amazing job at integrating him into the live performance and it is another example of bridging the old and the new nicely.<br />The Bee Gees do a nice job at including many of the songs that they wrote for other artists.  Besides &quot;Grease&quot;, there are versions of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, &quot;I Can't See Nobody&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, and &quot;Guilty&quot;.   The bad news is on the latter three songs, they are only small segments from those songs and they don't include the full version of the song.  It would have been nice if Barbra Streisand was folded into &quot;Guilty&quot; much like Frankie Valli for &quot;Grease&quot;, but these are minor flaws - the stuff that is included is still top notch.<br />The Bee Gees bring out a special guest - Celine Dion to sing &quot;Immortality&quot;.   I'm not a big Dion fan by any means, but she does an very nice job with the Brothers Gibb.  It is worth noting that this song was included in the Broadway Musical &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (which ironically was my other choice for 1998 co-Album of the Year).<br />On Tracks 9 through 16 the Bee Gees do sort of 'Unplugged' segment with &quot;Lonely Days&quot;, &quot;New York Mining Disaster&quot;, &quot;I Can't See Nobody&quot;, &quot;And the Sun Will Shine&quot;,  &quot;Nights on Broadway&quot;, &quot;How Could You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;,  &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, and &quot;Guilty&quot;.  Although again there are some segments of songs used here - the Brothers Gibb show that they just aren't Disco Kings by performing some excellent acoustics.  <br />As for the Saturday Night Fever stuff, the main Bee Gees stuff from the movie is all there.   There is a nice segue between &quot;Night Fever&quot; and &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; early in the concert.  Most of the SNF material comes later in the concert &quot;Jive Talkin&quot; (technically not an SNF song, but was on the Soundtrack), &quot;How Deep is Your Love&quot;,  and &quot;Stayin Alive&quot;.  The Bee Gees end their performance with a reprise of the electric start they used to this CD with &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;.   It is also worth noting that the classic songs &quot;Tragedy&quot; and &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; are also performed.<br />The liner notes are a little thin, however the band credits are given. Despite the thin liner notes, I think the performance speaks for itself.   Due to the death of Maurice Gibb in 2003, this would really be the last great live performance by the Bee Gees.   The innovations used in this performance combined with a high energy performance truly make this the Best Album for 1998.  It's a great way to discover or re-discover the Brothers Gibb.  Must Have CD.
B00006F7S4|2.0|If you are expecting Mellow Gold or Odelay, then stay far, far away from this. It's an entire album of somewhat wannabe Rolling Stones ballads.<br />Is it sad? Yes. Is it dark? Yes. It it entertaining? Not really. It just comes across as an entire album of boring guitar ballads. It isnt bad, just boring. *yawn*.<br />My friend let me borrow this, and I seriously wouldn't even burn it (and I am a Beck fan). Buyers beware...
B000059Z8J|5.0|The 1978 film Superman (and its companion piece, Superman II, more a continuation of the first film than a sequel) is, simply, the greatest film adaptation of a comic book character ever. The film is not without flaws, but is essential viewing.<br />It is that for a number of reasons. First is the loving and respectful adaptation of Superman, who is now more than a comic book character. Superman is an archetype, a myth, a folk hero. He is to us Americans what Hercules was to the Greeks, or Sir Lancelot to the English. The makers of this film actually *understood* this, and worked *with* and not *against* the mythic power of the character. (It sounds simple enough, but a generation of filmmakers afterward have failed to grasp the importance of this basic concept.)<br />Kudos to writer Tom Mankiewicz for taking Superman seriously. Kudos to director Richard Donner, whose work on this film may occasionally clunk along rather than soar, but whose understanding of what makes Superman truly heroic never falters. Kudos to Gene Hackman, for offering us the seemingly impossible--a lovable Lex Luthor. (You'd be laughing right along with this guy, even as he dropped a nuke on your house.) <br />Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth and the special effects team. The effects hold up surprisingly well after all this time. The truth is, Superman was never a quantum leap forward in effects the way, say, Star Wars or The Abyss were. The genius of this film was, and is, to emply a variety of effects--wires, bluescreen, miniatures, animation--to depict the same scene, then quick cut from one to the other. The viewer was, and is, usually not given enough time with any one effect to figure out how it's done. The eye is fooled into accepting the vision.<br />There is real magic here, but it didn't come from the special effects lab. It came from the heart and soul of Christopher Reeve, who plays both Superman and Clark Kent to perfection. In the end, it is Reeve that makes the movie credible, who makes you care. Check out the scene in Lois Lane's apartment where Reeve changes from Clark Kent to Superman and back again in a matter of seconds. There're no special effect at work, just Reeve using his voice and his body. That, my young friends, is what we used to call &quot;acting.&quot; Even in the age of CGI, It still has the power to knock you over.
0553260111|5.0|I bought \\"The Bourne identity\\" mostly because I didn't want to lose the opportunity of reading Ludlum's book before the release of a film based on it. I really wasn't a fan of the author (and I am not one now), but I loved this book.<br /><br />To start with, the plot is remarkably good. \\"The Bourne identity\\" is the story of a man without a past, rescued from the Mediterranean Sea by some fishermen. He is very ill, and his body has suffered the impact of many bullets. The man is taken by the fishermen to a doctor in a nearby island, who helps him to recover physically and mentally. Our protagonist doesn't remember who he is, but with the help of the doctor he finds some clues he doesn't like too much. He only knows for certain some things, for instance that his face has been altered by plastic surgery, that he knows a lot about firearms and that he carried on him a microfilm that contains the code to an account of four million dollars.<br /><br />In the Swiss bank where the account is he also finds a name: Jason Bourne. But... is he Jason Bourne?. He cannot remember, and if it were for quite a few people, he won't. From the moment he leaves the island onwards, our man without a past will be followed, and attacked. He doesn't understand why, but he reacts in order to stay alive. Add to this already interesting mixture a woman he takes as a hostage, Marie, a number of assasins (including the most famous assassin in the world, Carlos), and the possibility that he is, as a matter of fact, also an assassin, and you will understand why this book is so good. The main character will be hunted all throughout the book not only by the \\"bad guys\\", but also by the \\"good\\" ones (mainly agents from the USA Government). You won't be able to stop reading this book, and you will find yourself asking aloud to nobody in particular \\"who on earth is this man?\\" and \\"what started this whole mess\\"?.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book to those who appreciate a good thriller, and to those who don't usually read this kind of book but are open to new experiences. I belong to the last category, as I only read \\"The Bourne identity\\" because I was interested in watching the movie of the same name.<br /><br />By the way, I also recommend the movie (the 2002 version, with Matt Damon), that ended up bearing only a limited resemblance to the book. If I had to choose, I would choose the book without hesitation, but if you have the possibility not only of reading the book but also of watching the movie, do both things... You won't regret it, and you will probably have fun trying to compare the movie to the book !!<br /><br />Belen Alcatusually read this kind of book but are open to new experiences.

B000069CWE|1.0|I absolutely love Linkin Park. Before I discovered it, I was absolutely against punk rock. Maybe this CD was why. I loved Hybrid Theory, so I bought Reanimation. All the songs were taken and twisted into almost unrecognizable garbage. Do not buy this CD if you enjoyed Hybrid Theory, because it will ruin it for you. If you want more Linkin Park, buy Meteora, it's really great.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars DVD's that are coming out in September are NOT the original 1977, 1980 or 1983 theatrical releases NOR are they the 1997 special editions...these are the new 2004 versions, as mentioned on the Star Wars offical website and on thedigitalbits.com which even has a screen shot of the new Return of the Jedi 2004 special edition...it has the original Obi-wan (Alec Guiness), the same yoda, but has Hayden Christiansen as Anakin now as seen in the pic! I am looking forward to it immensely. I hope they have altered Jabba in this new version! In Episode 1 and 6 he is fat as he should be...between 1 and 4 it looks like he went to slim fast, then piled back on the pounds for episode 6...LOL. I know they had limitations being, the original Jabba shot was human...but still..I always get a laugh seeing it! I think it would be nice to see the Emperor in Episode 4! It will be cool, when you can watch all 6 movies back to back, 12 hours+ of Starwars....I can't wait until September...and of course to May 2005 for episode 3...
B0000CFW87|5.0|I heard this CD in its entirety at a party last night. I was stunned. I was in a room by myself feeding my newborn, and this music, this voice, this collaboration, drove me to tears! They were tears of pure joy, amazement that such beauty could be found in a voice. I mistook the artist for Andrea Boccelli, but was corrected. If you prefer shallow, loud and meaningless music, then by all means do not purchase this CD. But if you value talent which can reach the depths of your soul and touch you profoundly, this CD is for you.
B0001Z53C4|5.0|D12 World is a great CD, except, if you are expecting a sequel to &quot;Devil's Night,&quot; than you expected wrong. It's not as explicit, raw and inappropriate as D12's debut but it still features those six MCs, the disturbing Bizzarre, the skilled Proof, beat-man Kon Artis, Verse-hogger Swifty and barely-known Kuniva, as well as the lead singer, Eminem. &quot;My Band&quot; stands out the most on the album and D12 goes crunk on &quot;40 oz.&quot; The best songs would have to be &quot;Good Die Young,&quot; &quot;I'll Be Damned,&quot; and &quot;American Physcho 2.&quot; In this album, Em steps down and lets the other members of the group showcases themselves to a little bit of a farther extent. The edited version is edited perfectly, although it takes out Bizzarre's solo track, &quot;Just Like U,&quot; which I heard on a friend's unedited CD and it is... bizarre. Buy this CD definately. You won't be dispaointed.

B0001HAISG|4.0|This is a wonderful movie adaptation of the favorite novel Peter Pan. It really is a shame, that the movie didn't do well in box office, because it really is a good family movie.<BR>The graphics are very good and aren't way over the top like a lot of movies are. The back ground music is very beautiful and fits the story well.<BR>Jeremy Sumpter as a very beautiful and rich looking Peter Pan really fits and Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wending Darling really paces the mood at the begging of the story.<BR>The cast really complement each other and the full package is great to watch.
B00018D44U|5.0|All of you who are writing bad reviews saying &quot;Country crap&quot; etc. you arent music fans.. you dont even know what good music is. The fact is that Norah's Voice (Voice with a capital V!) may not be the most interesting intriguing uve ever heard.. but it is the most relaxing, reassuring music voice ive ever heard. The First 4 songs are amazing! Sunrise ok i thought was a bit lame the first time i heard it but listen to it a few times more and it wont be any less then her greatest song (which there is none coz they are all amazing). Whenever i listen to nroah i feel calm.. the whole world around me stops and its just me and her. I doubt there is anyone else in the whole world who has the power to do this with just her voice (and her great band)<BR>Also one idiot wrote that they wanted another &quot;come away with me&quot;  and that norah didnt care about her fans. You fool! If she kept on piping out the same old stuff people would get bored of her (except for me). She needs to change her styles, experiment maybe a little... thats what shes about... you never know what to expect.. but everything u do get is bloody amazin!<BR>The whole album is great, you dont listen to an album like this with a closed mind.. the variating kinds of music needs an open mind to be fully appreciated... and if youd rather go listen to &quot;metallica&quot; or some loud pile of crap like that.. then why are you reading this??? go listen to ur rubbish!!!

0790729970|2.0|There's a reason why this movie isn't shown on TV.  While Jim Carrey is very funny, and hits all the right notes in this Jekyll-and-Hyde story of a shy, sweet banker who turns into a super-powered, mischievously cartoonish caricature when he dons an ancient Norse mask, there are parts of this that are ghastly, overly graphic, and totally unhumorous.  For example, early on in the film, \\"masked\\" Stanley *robs a bank.*  My son was completely confused as to why the good guy is doing the same thing the bad guys must be stopped for. Is it OK for Stanley to rob the bank because he's angry at the way the management treated him? Or because he's funnier and more colorful than the bad guys? What on earth was the movie trying to say here?<br />To make things worse, during one of his sprees as The Mask, Stanley returns to the dishonest car mechanic that dealt badly with him in an earlier sequence in the film, and SODOMIZES HIM ANALLY WITH AN OBJECT.  The man is seen being wheeled out of his car shop after having been sexually assaulted by The Mask in this way.  It's grotesque and offputting, and it certainly wasn't funny. I found myself sympathizing with \\"regular\\" Stanley and glad at the outcome, but \\"masked\\" Stanley was no superhero, and I'd caution any parent who thinks this is a kid-friendly movie to think twice.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|As a fan of Marillion for many mabny years I admit I am some what bias. There is not much they do I don't like. After Fish left i lost track of them. I caught up and bought everything. I would say Afraid......and Brave are the best thing they have done. Why Brave was not the biggest seller of all time I will never know. I give them credit for going on and on. I purchased the 2 c.d. set from them directly, even paying in advance last year. I have listed to this c.d. for the past month perhaps 30-40 times. I have to agree with some of the others,It gets better after each listening. I have lent c.d. to freinds with instructions to listen at least 3 times prior to making an opinion. All have given it a 5 star rating. All have gone out to buy it. I e mailed Steve Hogarth,my opinion...there is no band doing this kind of music on the planet. I would call it Marillion's Sgt pepper. I feel I can say that as I was 17 when Sgt. pepper was released. I have over 8,000. c.d.'s in my collection. It's one of the top 10 I own.
B000001FI7|5.0|Wow!  This cd...wow...amazing, just bloody amazing!!!  the first time i heard Portishead was on Saturday night live, performing &quot;Sour Times (Nobody loves me)&quot; and i fell in love with Beth Gibbons' haunting and graceful voice.  I purchased this album 2day (5/31) and am simply in love.  With trip-hop sounds drenched in strings, vocals from Beth Gibbons (who has also gone solo under the name &quot;Poe&quot; [2 albums]), and jazz elements, one will be amazed at the beauty it all creates.  Somewhat minimalist, &quot;Dummy&quot; achieves what most artists' albums never do:  timeless continuity.<br />also recomended: Esthero/&quot;Breath from another&quot;&amp;&quot;Wikked lil grrrls&quot;(release: TBA)  - Bjork/all of her albums - Res/&quot;How i do&quot; - Aya/&quot;Strange flower&quot; - Aquanote/&quot;The Pearl&quot; - Miguel &quot;Migs&quot;/&quot;Colorful You&quot;&amp;&quot;Nude tempo 1&quot; - every album from the Naked Music record lable - Gemma Hayes/&quot;Night on my side&quot; - Sondre Lerche/all three of his albums

B000001FTA|5.0|I can't think of another band that influenced me in my youth the way these guys did. I consider them the best rock band of all. I know Phil wrote the occasionally awful line, and at times the songs were just downright peculiar (\\"S & M\\" off \\"Black Rose\\" comes to mind), but the unique sound and look of the band set them apart, and gave them a unique, singular voice. <br />Here is Thin Lizzy again offering very diverse material, songs that kick you in your butt (\\"Bad Reputation\\", \\"Opium Trail\\", \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" and \\"Killer Without A Cause\\"), what could be considered religious songs (\\"Downtown Sundown\\" and \\"Dear Lord\\", songs I find incredibly heartfelt, beautiful, and at times, awkward. God bless you, Phil), and pop songs with great guitar licks (\\"Southbound\\", \\"That Women's Gonna Break Your Heart\\" and  \\"Dancing in The Moonlight\\", my least favorite track on the album). Not what you would expect from what everyone was saying was a \\"hard rock\\" band. <br />When I consider that Thin Lizzy released the following 4 STUDIO albums consecutively....\\"Jailbreak\\" (1976), \\"Johnny the Fox\\" (1976), \\"Bad Reputation\\" (1977) and \\"Black Rose\\" (1979), and when I listen to them now, scratches and all, ....I think that Thin Lizzy is still my favorite rock band, and I wish to god I could play guitar like Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson, and be as cool as Phil Lynott. These 4 albums are rock nirvana to me.<BR> <BR>If push came to shove, I consider \\"Bad Reputation\\" their best album. It is more Scott Gorham than Brian Robertson, and for that,I give it up to Scott Gorham. But I wish the two would have stayed together, especially when you hear them together on \\"That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart\\". <br />My biggest regret was not seeing them on November 1st, 1977 at the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee WI, in support of this album. I was 14 at the time, and Thin Lizzy wasn't as popular as some of the other bands back then. Nobody really wanted to go to the show with me, and when your 14 you don't really feel comfortable going alone. As such, I never got the chance to see this band live, in person. But I hear that Scott Gorham and John Sykes have their version of Thin Lizzy touring this summer (with a date in my hometown, no less. Maybe I can fly there to see them).
B0001UL7RY|4.0|for people like mat who don't know how to spell or think about music shouldn't be writing reviews.  Bottom line check out the CD yourself and you might enjoy it.
B000001F9E|5.0|This album was the first time I had heard of the band &quot;Thin Lizzy&quot;, (I was 13 at the time. It was our nation's bicentennial!). It was also the album that made me want to learn guitar as a kid, and I knew exactly how I wanted to sound. LIKE THESE GUYS!!!!<BR> To me the look and sound of Thin Lizzy was the coolest. I never felt cheated with any of their STUDIO albums (even &quot;Renegade&quot; had some great moments on it), and I admire their courage to record songs that made Thin Lizzy a truly &quot;singular&quot; band. <br />But not everyone was so taken with this band. Critically they were often slammed. Read what Robert Christgau wrote about Thin Lizzy, and the album &quot;Jailbreak&quot;....... (from Robert Christgau, Christgau's Record Guide, 1981)....<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;The proof of how desperate people are for new Springsteen is that they'll settle for this -- even &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; is the sort of thing that ends up in Bruce's wastebasket. If Irish teen traumas are as boring as Phil Lynott's descriptions of them, it's no wonder they have trouble maintaining their birthrate. And if Irish teen traumas are as secondhand as Scott Gorham's guitar lines, the Irish will probably end up preferring Springsteen too. B- &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />I'm glad Thin Lizzy sound didn't compare to the bombast of &quot;everyman&quot; and critical darling, Bruce Springsteen. And I'm glad that the band kept doing what IT wanted to musically, critics be damned. Thin Lizzy's guitar work when Scott and Brian played together was brilliant, the song styles and subject matter varied, the song writing was at times subpar (being honest here), but usually excellent. They were never boring. There sound was exciting, and at times different and very challenging, unlike Springsteen (why people tried to compare the two is beyond me).<br />When Thin Lizzy released these 4 studio albums consecutively....Jailbreak (1976) Johnny the Fox  (1976) Bad Reputation  (1977) BlackRose (1979)....it was rock nirvana for me. I can't think of another band that influenced me in my youth the way these guys did, and I thank them for it. I would have given anything to play guitar like Scott and Brian, and be as cool as Phil.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Her songs are most craps. one day, I woke up and her songs was being played on the radio. guess what, I had a miserable headache all that day. and when I first listened to 'Me against the music', I easily noticed she hadn't been changed at all.<BR>and when I listened to the song 'Toxic', I was about to throw up. It sounded disgusting to me!<BR>Please do not buy any of her albums. Money is very important in you life, and you know that.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I loved this musical, even though it deviated from the book, a dark political satire, into a happy piece of Broadway fluff.  They may have messed with the story too much, but they messed with it well. <br />The score is uneven.  Some songs are just gorgeous, others seem a bit bland and poppy.  I would even say that some songs really didn't need to be in there (&quot;What Is This Feeling&quot; comes to mind).  Both Chenoweth and Menzel give fantastic performances.  I don't think Chenoweth really got enough of the music for herself though.   Menzel is a talented singer, but she is obviously a pop singer, whose strongest talents are of the Broadway belter variety.  Chenoweth has a well-trained, versatile voice that seems to adapt to an endless number of styles.  Her chances to show this off were a bit limited though in this show.  This CD is certainly worth the money for the great performances of &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, and &quot;The Wizard and I&quot;.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|Everyone was cast well, except for Anne. Yes, she's supposed to be tired, plain, worn out, lost her &quot;bloom&quot;. But she was once a pretty girl and she's also supposed to have a sense of humour, and have enough manners to hide her own feelings in a social setting. <br />Amanda Root's Anne in this movie is seriously plain/unattractive, and one can't imagine how she could ever be considered pretty 8 years ago with her long nose, plain eyes, and indeterminate jawline. But that's not the problem. <br />The problem is that in every scene in which Captain Wentworth's name is mentioned, her eyes go all big, her jaw drops, and she goes all pale and frozen and can't function in a social setting. She becomes a total dumbwit. When Wentworth's name is mentioned, Anne is supposed to be stricken, barely functioning mentally, yet also hiding it beneath her manners and continuing to attend to others in conversation. Furthermore, Amanda Root's Anne doesn't show any conversational ability until she's talking with Mr. Elliot in Bath. A little late in the movie, isn't it?<br />The Anne portrayed by Ms. Firbanks in the 1971 version of Persuason is at least 10 years too old, but I preferred that Anne's social adeptness. Even when stricken, she tried to hide it and spare the people around her from being worried about her, and acted graciously. And you could see her past beauty, and her conversational/social graces.<br />The rest of the movie is good, the costumes, classical music, Captain Wentworth is particularly well cast, etc. Although Bentwick is dreadfully unattractive and the conversation often too quiet to understand.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for these things, but I'm doing it for this because I bought this DVD a little while ago and I have to say that the performances by the Floyd in Pompeii are simply mind-blowing.  I can honestly say that it's the best thing that I own, and not just with DVD's.  It's the best thing I own, period.  I watch it pretty much every day.  The abstract clips of the history of pompeii complements the session so much, but even if it weren't there, it would still be amazing.  The four of them have never played so emotionally and thoughtfully, however drugged they may be.  This music really does transcend all things and it's worth every penny to buy this DVD.  Saucerful of Secrets... Careful with That Axe Eugene... Echoes... it's hard to pick my favorite out of the performances.  Don't be turned off by the fact that there aren't any of the more famous &quot;Wall&quot; songs or &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; songs played live.  These earlier songs are just as good and better and it will NOT dissapoint you.  I can't exagerate enough just how much the video touched me, and will surely touch all you Floyd fans.
0790731452|2.0|...but it doesn't work.  And I WANTED it to work, especially after seeing INDEPENDENCE DAY the summer before.  Will Smith's cigar-smoking bravado and Bill Pullam's uninspiring president made me want to see a wild and irreverent sci-fi send-up.<br />But there's a lot of dead air in this movie.  I loved ED WOOD (and still think it's Burton's best film), but I also have a theory: Tim Burton's films are always 20 minutes too long.  Every single one of them (except maybe the first Pee Wee Herman film, which is still hilarious).<br />There are moments of greatness here, but they come way too late.  My two favorite moments were (1) how the aliens are ultimately defeated and (2), no matter what was asked of singer Tom Jones, he could do it.  I loved that!  But those scenes came way late in the movie and, before that, this movie was all over the place.<br />(Other scenes worth mentioning: the Martians' response to the dove of goodwill and what they say when they learn English).<br />They needed either the Zucker Brothers (with Jim Abrams) or even the Coen Brothers take a shot at the script--then it might have had some more laughs and momentum.<br />Great special effects though.
B00005JLRT|3.0|STAR TREK: NEMESIS (2002) may have flopped miserably at the box office (I believe that it is the only STAR TREK film not to have recouped its entire investment from theater receipts) and with critics (most gave it a pithy two-star rating or below), but I really wonder what most people were expecting. After two consecutive TREK films directed by &quot;Number One&quot; Jonathan Frakes, Stuart Baird takes the helm for this one, the 10th installment of the celebrated space saga. Baird, who had previously made EXECUTIVE DECISION (1996) and U.S. MARSHALLS (1998), is the first Briton to ever direct a STAR TREK film. That's neither here nor there; just a fun fact. The film he directs here is dark, much closer in tone to STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT (1996) than the lighter STAR TREK: INSURRECTION (1998). That's not to say that this film is as good as the incredibly amazing FIRST CONTACT; however, it's not any worse than INSURRECTION. In fact, I like it better than INSURRECTION. I really do not believe that this entry deserved all the bad press it received and all the bad reviews it still receives. However, I think that I can understand the reasons for the negativity: I intuit that, NEMESIS did not advance the story forward in the way that most TREK fans had wanted or expected.<br />I liked the beginning of the film, which has the entire crew celebrating the long-awaited marriage of Commander Will Riker (Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (a now curiously straight-haired Marina Sirtis---I liked it better they way it used to be). I also liked the surprising cameo by Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew from the beloved &quot;Star Trek Voyager&quot; series). I also liked the suspenseful setup with the Shinzon character; he seems evil, but seems to warmly treat the Captain, but he must have ulterior motives somewhere...I really did not know where the film was going to go till after the midway point, and that's a good thing. I do agree that the end result of NEMESIS is fairly disappointing, part of the reason being the death of a beloved character; however, most of the film contains a good mix of drama, action and even a little but humor (although not anything on the scale of the one-liner-laden INSURRECTION). I think the reason for the negative overreaction is that this will be the final TREK FILM featuring the &quot;Next Generation&quot; cast. I don't know what's to come after, but hopefully it will be as special as the STAR TREK franchise is as a whole...and hopefully, it will revive the now-sagging series.<br />Bottom line: Don't let the critics dissuade you; see this exciting film. In fact, you should add it to your STAR TREK collection. I have!<br />RECOMMENDED
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I'm one of the people who is really annoyed by Avril's punkness that we're all familiar with, and the first CD showed little talent, lyrics that made absolutely no sense (Skater Boy?), and stupid themes in the songs. This new CD is so good compared to her debut, the music is better and a lot less cheesy, lyrics are better, and it's just a much more mature album.
B000001ESJ|5.0|I remember the first time I heard \\"A Farewell to Kings,\\" I was 14 years old and the album had just come out, my older brother went out and got it, but I immediately siezed it for myself, I remember sitting by the speakers for hours captivated by Geddy Lee's sexy, seductive voice. Then there's Neal Pert's amazing drumming, and the blazing guitar riffs, they're all in tip-top shape on this masterpiece. I've been a HUGE Rush fan ever since I got this album, and it has remained my favorite ever since. Who can blame me? It just rocks so hard. Tracks like the title track and Xanadu are hard for any rocker to ignore. My favorite thing about this album though, is Geddy Lee. Her voice is so sultry that I can't help but be a bit attracted her. Geddy if you're looking for a man, gimme a call!<br />-Roger
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Finally. It's about time we get a movie that really tell us something about the Vampires and Werewolves. I just could not understand why Werewolves had to do all the beck and call for those vampires thoughout the movies/books ages.<br />Was it because Vampires needed the &quot;eyes&quot; in the daylight, the know where's and the how to's. I'm sorry, but I always thought that Werewolves were much stronger than Vampires (OH NO, I might have said something bad there)They had the change and opportunity to kill their 'masters' but no, those werewolves (sigh) they listened and did all the wrong doings for those vampires, but what! 'Underworld' is not that kind of movie at all.<br />So, what the movie is trying to say (I'm being sarcastic here) is that with the blood of a Wolf and a Vamp you can get something stronger thus ending the fued and gaining the respect between the two? I can buy that...<br /> So Kate Beckinsale interested in action/horror movies are you? Well good for you, (saw you in Van Hesling,) very good acting. Your character? Very believable worked for me here in this movie and their in that movie.<br />Yes, and we must leave room for romance, and this movie has that.
B000002NJS|5.0|I do not like madonna.  i do not like her music, so it is a strange coincidence i like this album.  it is the best pop/dance/electronic album of the 90's and if you need to dance, buy it now
B000002J09|4.0|1st i want to say Led Zeppelin Is one of the greatest bands of all time. This album is great, i personally like stairway to heaven and black dog best but theres a little problem, i recently looked on this website and it said if you play one part of Stairway To Heaven which starts out as...&quot;if theres a burssle in ur head, dont be alarmed now&quot;......theres evidence of satanic lyrics. I didnt belive it being such big Zeppelin fan. But WHen i tried it out for myself, there are satanic lyrics that are a little disturbing. And if you try it out go ahead, but if it will change your beiews on led zeppelin i wouldnt reccomend it. But I am Still a Hardcore Zepplin fan...nothing has changed. So buy this album.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I never watch the Today show, but yesterday was one of those rare occasions when I did.  What luck... I saw Renee Olstead sing and had to run out and buy her CD.  I never buy a CD like that... goes to show what an impact Renee made.  With so many Pop singers singing the same old music Renee's singing and music is refreshing.  I play in a Jazz Band(Big Band Music) and this CD reminds me why this music is so good.  It is so hard to find a great jazz singer these days... but one has been found.  Renee is spectacular!
0312263120|3.0|Lovers David and Susan awake one morning and are sent on separate life-threatening missions with the same purpose: Locate the cause of the worms in National Security Agency's computer, the world's largest, and debug it. The plot, structure, and characters are typical Dan Brown, with page-turning twists and surprises. Those who have read his other novels will feel immense familiarity with \\"Digital Fortress.\\"<br />This is Brown's first novel, and in some ways in shows. Fearful of losing his reader, there are many redundancies and hyper-explanations. Many of the revelations are already known by any intelligent soul. It is not as taut as \\"Angels &amp; Demons\\" or the \\"D'Vinci Code.\\" but change the theme (computers) and characters, and you have the same type of compelling novel that keeps the pages flying. Recommended.
B00005Y228|5.0|I must say, I really enjoy the fever album.  Kylie is the only artist that was around in the 80's 90's and 00's (other than Madge) .  Unlike Madonna, Kylie completely changes her style and she actually knows how to use her voice.  Having seen Kylie live and listened to all her CDs and even rare performances such as Dancing Queen and Waltzing Matilda I can understand what all the fuss is about.  If you get the chance to see Kylie in concert GO! People are quick to criticise but never knock someone until you have seen them and given them the chance.  We Brits have almost adopted Kylie as our own.  She is lovely has sex appeal and she keeps on the right side of the boundry.  The girl next door image always shines through but this woman will be going strong in another 10 years.... The best is yet to come.  Body Language is extremely good and again a complete new direction.  Only Kylie has the confidence to take such risks and it pay off.  Highlights for me on the Fever album are the infamous can't get you out of my head, Love at first sight, In Your Eyes and Fragile.  There is also a little Gem on the Australian version called Tightrope.  This is fab and should be on the European and US version, but hey.  <br />Kylie you rock!
0060512806|4.0|Reviewing an epic novel like &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is not easy.  The sheer depth of Neal Stephenson's 1,100-page story about World War II codebreakers and modern-day technology entrepreneurs is bound to make any quick summary or analysis seem inadequate.  That said, I will mention a few positives and negatives that struck me about this book.<br />POSITIVES:  The story itself is remarkably clever and well thought out.  Mr. Stephenson obviously did a tremendous amount of research on the World War II era and the art of cryptography, both past and present.  Anyone with an interest in these subjects will not be disappointed.  It is also obvious that Stephenson spent a considerable amount of time in the Philippines, where the bulk of the story unfolds.  Actually, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is several stories that run parallel to one another throughout the book and then gradually converge near the end.  Stephenson makes it obvious from the beginning that these seemingly disparate plot lines are somehow related, but the relationship does not become clear for quite some time.  Watching them intersect is very satisfying.<br />NEGATIVES:  The book is far longer than necessary.  Those who read Stephenson's fast-paced &quot;Snow Crash&quot; will be surprised by the tempo of &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; which is much slower and more deliberate.  Stephenson often gets sidetracked, using many pages to establish what ultimately turns out to be a minor element in the story line.  The book probably would be much stronger without 300 or 400 pages of unnecessary material.  Also, there are a few too many coincidences, which hurt the story's plausibility.  Some of the coincidences are appropriate and necessary to the plot line, but others were thrown in for no apparent reason.  For example, a primary character just happens to stumble upon the Hindenburg Disaster while riding his bike one evening, yet this episode has no bearing on the story (unless there is some hidden meaning beyond mygrasp).<br />Overall, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; will not disappoint those who invest their time and money in it.  Neal Stephenson is a stylish author with a vivid imagination and a sharp sense of humor.  His passion for technology, mathematics, and history practically leap off the page.  In &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; he has combined these elements into an intriguing and unique tale.
B00006RINF|5.0|I'm not going to write a long review, firstly what needs to be said has already been said and secondly, there isn't much to say about this album except that it's pure and utter brilliance.  I don't know if Lacuna Coil did this on purpose or accidentally but they made my decade with this album.  Christina has an incredible range and I don't know if anyone else could sound as good with her than Andrea.  Definitely check this album out.

Fans of the first disk shouldn't be too dissapointed. The songs sound very similar, Avril sticking to her &quot;mean punk skater girl&quot; approach. She has written almost all of the songs on the album, which is respectable considering that most of her peers don't. Standouts include &quot;Take Me Away,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending.&quot;<br />Overall rating: Three and a half stars.
B000024JEX|4.0|Although the cover of the box set doesn't say so, this is not a Jarrett solo set, but the 'Standards' trio, consisting of Jarrett, DeJohnette and Gary Peacock, recorded in the intimacy of the Blue Note over just three days in 1995.<br />I say 'intimacy' because, judging by the applause, I'd be surprised if there were more than 300 in the audience. And you get frequent reminders that they are there -- on CD#1, track #1, around 7:10, you can hear a wine bottle go tumbling!<br />It's so hard to pin Jarrett down. He's produced excellent group work (e.g. 'Survivors' and 'Nude Ants'), solo albums (e.g. 'Vienna' and 'Dark Intervals'), solo classical (e.g. Handel) and the experimental (e.g. 'Spheres' and 'Arbour Zena').<br />Previously I've found the Standards trio to be the least compelling aspect of his output -- it's tempting, on first hearing, to put it in the 'dinner jazz' category which so many other trios have successfully played. Jarrett's own compositions are of such a high calibre that it seems almost wasteful to have the band play largely other composers' songs. Perhaps it helps to have seen the trio perform on video or DVD, then you realise how special the band is. In the Japanese concert I have, Jarrett seems to spend over half the concert playing the concert standing up (and dancing rather strangely!). Jarrett's scat-singing is also, uhm, unusual -- I doubt whether he was taught the technique at the Juilliard.<br />Although not budget-priced, it's impossible to fault this collection, and it is easy to be overwhelmed by the range of songs that the band played over three days, in two 65-minute sets per day.
B00012FXB8|1.0|One of the worst ways to ruin a sequal, in my opinion, is to kill off the survivors of the previous in the very begging. (What's the point in having them survive, then?) Not only does it hurt the sequal, but deminishes the previous as well.<br />Then there is the whoel problem of how the eggs got there in the first place.<br />If you want a good sequal to &quot;Aliens&quot;, find the Dark Horse comics versions. They are &quot;Aliens: Book 1&quot;, &quot;Aliens: Book2&quot;, and &quot;Aliens: Earthwar&quot;.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Of all the songs on this album, the Johnny Cash version of &quot;A Satisfied Mind&quot; grabs at my heart like no other. Johnny's voice makes it come across as a very personal version and it was one of the last songs he recorded before he died.  The song was an early hit for Porter Wagoner and has been recorded by many people. But Johnny's version is the only one I feel is as good as Porter's version.  At the moment, this CD is the only place you can find Johnny's version although I've heard it may appear on an upcoming CD of his last recordings.  Regardless, the song itself is something very special and I am happy it was included in the film.<BR>There are a lot of good songs on this CD, but I give it 5 stars for this rare performance all by itself.<br />BJ Pruett
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd is unbelievable and I can't get enough of it. I just don't understand how people can diss this album.  The music and lyrics are to perfection.  It's different from slipknot origional stuff but it's awesome in every aspect. They have matured a lot and there music is much better now than it ever was. This album goes to show you that slipknot can do anything they want and be extremly successful. I can't name one band that can do what they have done with the music industry.
1582432678|2.0|I had picked up this book with high hopes but rather ended up being disappointed.  Shouldn't Kevin's name really Damian (from The Omen)?  Such a bad seed...I do not buy Eva's lack of bonding with him.  I am not sure what she was suposed to bond with.  There was not a single moment anywhere in the story where Kevin acted like a regular little boy.  Not one moment of niceness anywhere.  To say she rejected him when he rejected her breast, is trite.  If as a baby he had moments of cuteness, I am sure she would have felt better about him, like she was with Celia, her daughter.  Her husband, Franklin, was a big boob.  His gee wiz Daddy-O routine was over the top and not believable.  Also, Eva would have received some support from the community. After all, she found her daughter impaled on the arrow target and her husband murdered.  I would have been interested in the aftermath of her discovering the bodies - who did she call, who came to investigate?  What about that funeral? She says she called the victim's families to see if it would be okay for her to go what what her little' girls's or husband funerals? Also, why in the world would she devote Saturday's to Kevin?  He murdered her little girl in such a barbaric way that how could you even want to talk to him, especially after the eye thing? Just because he is her son?  Not reasonable.  Kevin clearly was born with some misallignment in his brain, some defect, that the blame can not be Eva's alone.
B000002TQV|5.0|You won't find anything on THE BENDS as unique as &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; or as haunting as &quot;Karma Police.&quot;  Still, it's the only Radiohead album without a single song you'll get sick of.<br />The weakest tune would have to be &quot;Bulletproof&quot;, but really, it's all relative with a record this strong.
1582432678|1.0|What I found lacking in this book was Eva and Franklin's role as parents.  Kevin was obviously different, an unengaging, not responsive, emotionally distrubed child yet neither parent seemed to feel therapy was an option or should be something they should check into?  I think Kevin was born bad and therapy would be useless but it still, especially today, been a logical step for a parent to take with a child who is not quite right and it is not as if money was an issue for this family.  But Eva's biggest failure is in being Celia's parent.  She knew Kevin was guilty of harming her in such a terrible fashion yet what does she do to protect Celia in the future?  She stays and puts her child in further danger.  For that crime, and it is a crime, she should bear the guilt.
0767830555|5.0|A good deal of the controversy about &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; revolves around its ending, and justifiably so.  There are basically two criticisms that are particularly valid:  The first revolves around the violence in the picture.  Even by today's much too jaded standards, Travis Bickel's rampage is quite shocking.  The question is: Was that extreme violence absolutely necessary to show the viewer? In other words, there is a sense that the viewer is being merely titillated by violence. Is it just violence for violence sake with no redeeming characteristic? Or isn't that Martin Scorsese's point?  Isn't the violence pointless and irrational because Travis Bickle's life is pointless and he is himself an irrational person?<br />The second point of criticism is of course why the film ends as it does.  Should it have ended with the exterior scene of police cars with their flashing lights and the assembled crowd of onlookers?  Or is the extending ending just right?  Did the post-rampage scenes really happen (in the story)?  Or are they a halucination that Bickle is experiencing as he is dying from his gunshot wounds?  Does it really matter anyway?<br />My own position is that, within the context of the story,  it really doesn't matter whether Bickle is dreaming those &quot;events&quot; or not because Paul Schrader (the screenwriter) wrote the story that way to, among other things, highlight the nature of fame and celebrity.  Aside from the fact that as viewers we know that Bickle is really no hero and therefore doesn't deserve to be treated as one, we recognize the absurdity of the press and its hunger for &quot;red meat&quot; stories and images. As the famous definition of celebrity goes: a celebrity is someone who is famous for being famous. If the film had ended suddenly with the exterior post-rampage street scene, Schrader would not have been able to make this additional point.  Scorsese's directorial talents are therefore beyond criticism.  In any event, Scorsese and Schrader worked closely on this film and I don't see the point in second guessing them. They are both men of considerable talent and their judgement has to respected. They knew what they were doing. <br />Besides, if someone wants to know what the film would be like without the post-rampage scenes all they have to do is stop the VHS/DVD player. By the way, the film that was used for Bickle's rampage scene was not chosen as &quot;grainy.&quot;  The correct term is that the colors were desaturated.  It was done to avoid the possibility of garnering an &quot;X&quot; rating which would have severely limited the film's audience at the time.  (Even today an &quot;NC-17&quot; rating is the kiss of death for a movie). Sadly, when a search for the original film stock with fully saturated colors was made many years later, it was found to have deteriorated beyond the point of recovery.  What a shame! It would have made for an interesting restored version. <br />In any event, there is no need for me to recommend this film.  It recommends itself.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|When i purchased this album, i bought it mainly on the fact that &quot;Time is Running Out&quot; is an amazing song. Im not a fan of Muse, but after hearing only 30 seconds of the first track i knew i just purchased the best album of the year so far. I love how different sounding this band is, but they add so much soul into each song that i feel my heart tense up my eyes water just by hearing the notes in each song.<BR>I have never heard such an amazing mixture of rock with soft rock, sounding much like Radiohead, but adding the many qualities that Radiohead themselves missed out on. The lyrics are amazing and deep, leaving you breathless in a way, wanting more but not expecting to recieve something better than what you just heard. <BR>The instrument use is powerful, and never repetitive to the point of boredom. His vocal are beautiful adding only more of the element that makes this band truly amazing. For any rock, hard rock, alternative, or any other genre listener out there, this is the album that all must have, for it will please the ears of any who listens, and leave you asking why you never heard of them before.<BR>Every song on this album i rate a perfect, i find no flaw at all, they are truly perfect.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Man, I HATE THIS BAND, but this is really a great record. If you don't like Fleetwood Mac, but are in the mood for something arty and chilled out, this may very well catch you off guard. Some of the bands best songs in a casual atmosphere. I bought the vinyl for 99 cents and it grew on me until I shelled out for the double disc. The 2nd disc with all the bonus stuff is full of good things.
0201626632|3.0|Most of the pages in this brief book are devoted to statements of the obvious that anyone worthy of a Ph.D. should be able to discern on his or her own. There are some useful points on presentations and communication. The author points out the excessive burdens of being an assistant professor and suggests that the candidate establish a reputation in industry or government, then seek a (presumably tenured) academic post. Though I agree that one should avoid being an assistant professor at all costs, I cannot think of a single professor in my discipline (Organic Chemistry) who has obtained a tenured position without moving up through the assistant professor rank.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I don't understand how anyone could say that this album is not heavy.  Granted, Vol. 3 doesn't have the same level of brutality or intensity throughout that their previous releases did, but it's still a very hard album.  I don't believe the band has sold out, and to compare this album to something released by Staind, etc. is absolutely absurd.  I feel this album is a little more representative of the range of emotions that people experience, opposed to all anger all the time.  Although I prefer the angrier stuff, it's not bad to access other emotions from time to time.  Also, I'm glad that Slipknot have gone away from some of the rediculous choruses that were present on Iowa (People=S**t, Disasterpiece, etc.)  More maturity doesn't necessarily equate to being softer.  It seems like bands that have any kind of following are put into a tough position by their fans in terms of evolution.  They are damned if they do, and damned if they don't.  I think it's good for the band, and metal music in general that Slipknot mixed it up a little bit on this album.
B00005J6UP|5.0|One of the 1980s' most enjoyable romps, this fun adventure throws together a group of kids spending their last days with one another into a quest for hidden treasure, all with escaped criminals on their tail. What follows is a movie filled with spills, chills, chases, action, awesome set pieces and obstacles, and plenty of humor. All very predictable, and all very fun. Think The Little Rascals in the world of Indiana Jones and you have the right idea.<br />Take note before buying this for kids: Some of the humor from the 80s is probably more risqué than would be expected. This would probably get a PG-13 were it released today. The kids joke about sexuality and drugs in a way that many might be surprised about. Parents with small children, proceed with caution. That said, the movie remains kid friendly enough that it should be fine for most kids over 10.<br />This DVD looks very good; while not state-of-the-art, it is an improvement over the VHS versions that have kicked around for years. Great sound, good picture. All very nice.<br />The extras really stand out here. We have a Making Of documentary that covers all the bases, with plenty of on set footage and interviews. Informative and well done. An array of deleted scenes was surprisingly good - some of this footage is excellent - though not complete. Finally, the DVD commentary brings the cast back together for a very funny gathering as they swap stories from way back when. Good viewing for longtime fans.<br />The only downer on this DVD is that it comes in one of those awful Warner's snapcases. This reviewer hates those cases; if you have no such hatred, then there is nothing to worry about. A nice buy for the price.

B000089CKH|1.0|I was looking up the term 'power pop' in the dictionary the other day and I got the following definition 'bland, derivative, lazy, uninspired music'.  I had to agree with the definition, at least after hearing Nada Surf.  Nada Surf, for those of you who are fool and don't know had this one really big hit Popular that was funny, witty, and one of the few good songs on the albums.  But the indie kids, always looking for something cool to latch onto, jumped on the Nada Surf bandwagon to look superior to their peers who gave up on the band long ago.  This isn't anything you haven't already heard before.  Basically they take Weezer, and remove any of the intensity and emotion that comes along with it.  Let Go does manage to have one good song though, Killian's Red.  It stands out among the wasteland of the rest of the album.  It'd be nice to see Nada Surf take a smart, witty approach to their music as shown in the song Popular, but until then stay far, far away from the band.
1400032717|1.0|Don't waste your money, it was almost as bad as Life of Pi, someone trying to fill up pages with text, going into detail of things that shouldn't be detailed and then continuing on with the story line. What a waste!, If you want to read well written books I'll suggest: The Kite Runner, The Poisonwood Bible, Lovely Bones all well written- I can tell..no struggle to fill pages.
B0001AP158|4.0|As someone who thought the CD was horrible, yet had seen them do a one hour accoustic set last summer in Minneapolis that was fantastic, I approached this DVD with some trepidation.  I ended up enjoying it very much!  Most of the songs  hold up very well to these reinterpretations, and I think the ballads are much better because they are not so over-the-top.  Its a little weird to hear toned-down versions of their anthem-rock hits, but from a purely musical perspective, they did a very good job.  Doesn't hurt to have the guys from Southside Johnny helping them out!<br />Overall, if you are expecting the usual Bon Jovi, you will be sorely disappointed.  But if you are open to a different style, its very good.  They would never have achieved the level of fame they have with this, but its fun.
B00005KHJR|5.0|I have just seen this movie end five minutes ago and will proclaim that this is the shortest period of time before I wrote a review of a movie after watching it. <BR>The plot has been reiterated over 100 times, just scroll down and you can find it. <BR>The movie begins as a mystery with a police officer coming to the town and beginning the investigation of a missing girl. As night falls the movie starts to turn into a campy 70s-80s style horror/gore/porno style flick with the weird singing, gratuitous nudity, and dark and haunting imagery of the graveyard. From this point the viewer will assume that they know the direction in which the movie is headed; headed into a vat of gratuitous nudity and possibly some gory scenes. These images subside rather quickly and we are returned to the mystery imagery. We then see children learning about pagan sex symbols and singing songs about rituals and whatever else. The mystery begins to unfold with an empty desk in the middle of a class in a town with a total of a few hundred residents. <BR>Officer Howie begins to discover more clues and a web of mendacity and conspiracy in the strange town. Soon he is lead down the path to the true nature of the town. I will not divulge the ending to those that have not yet seen it but it is rather dramatic. <BR>The movie's imagery is thoroughly interesting and even if you are not captivated by the exhilerating plot you are sure to be impressed by the interesting surroundings and some of the outright bizarre rituals. Though it may seem that the plot moves a little slowly, everything has relevance to the story.<BR>The movie I beleive is wrongly referred to as a horror movie as there is not a single scene where you will jump up out of your seat, there are however some rather dramatic and powerful images that might disturb you but none that will genuinely frighten. Furthermore the movie does not create the same mood as a horror film partly because the first time director did not know much about creating mood or atmosphere, however this is all ok as I love unconventional movies.<BR>Furthermore the music in the movie is truly unique and every one of the actors has a powerful voice and the instrumentals are also very good, all played on celtic folk instruments of sorts. The movie has enough music to be called a musical however this is the farthest thing in the world from broadway.<BR>Overall this movie could not be more recommended, and as you can of course see i am not the only person to hold such an opinion about this movie.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is one of the most unique Slipknot albums that has ever hit the streets!  That's not to say that the album is bad, but very enlightening, dark, and simply amazing!  It's interesting to hear Slipknot do a few acoustic songs.  THis show me there compassion and some other raw emotions that are better put in simplistic songs that the &quot;rashing-out-at-the-world&quot;, brutal songs!  This album also holds some dark metal tones, some heavier than the others, reminding us of the first @ second album!  The sound is filled with a wide-range of emotions here: sadness, hate, and some dark compassion.  I think what Slipknot was trying to do was to combined some of the elements of Stone Sour, with some elements of other great metal artists who we've come to love and know, like: Metallica, Godsmack, etc.  I'm not saying that these sounds are closely related to these metal bands, but they have some similarities to Slipknot's new sound.  Yes, Slipnot has &quot;matured&quot; their sound to a relatively similar sound to some of our current and notable metal bands, but still hold the core withing their grasp.  They will never lose grip or let go of their &quot;core&quot; beginnings, but just pefect it into a modern-day metal song that we have heard before with a Slipknot style! <BR>               Yes, the lyrics are not as brutal, the swearing and f-ing is silenced just a bit, but I think that can be explained by the album name- Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses).  The fact is, their are messages within these lyrics that tell stories of their own, ones of sadness, madness, anger, and evil intent.  If you took the time to read the lyrics, you'd see what I mean.  Maybe the brutality in the swearing lyrics are taking rest, but there is a hidden brutality within the lyrics, one which effect certain people in each story or maybe even yourselves.  So before you go dissing this album, listen to the songs, listen to it's brutality, and read their stories (lyrics).  This is what makes Slipknot who they are and what they have become to be.  Slipknot forever!!!!!!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I know the title might be a bit redundant, most vampire movies inolve a little bit of eye candy.  Even both of the Vampires movies had attractive characters even if only a few.  But the makers of this film make it their primary focus.<br />The acting is for the most part cheesy or bad, the actors are good looking, the plot has truck sized holes, and the it all has a slick and stylized look.<br />But I am not saying that it is bad, it is a fun action flick.   <br />It is all based off an age old war between the werewolves and the vampires.  Years ago the werewolves were slaves to the vampires, but by their legends they broke free and a war started.  Now they are both out for the extinction of their enemy.  The Lycans(werewolves), are losing the war, the werewolves are getting desperate because they know they are losing and face being wiped out by their former masters.  so they are looking for a solution in the form of an individual, the decendent of some special individual.  Kate Beckinsale is a vampire assasin(death dealer), who is caught up in the political machinations of her family.<br />The movie has some good if improbable action sequences.  I often wondered how many bullets her gun was capable of holding.  The costumes and the sets were spectacular.  The characters were pretty and looked the roles that they were assigned.<br />The bad was primarily the acting.  A few of the actors were flat out terrible.  Beckinsale looks right for the role, but that is where it ends.  She seems unenthusiastic in her delivery, making her character wooden.  The plot might make sense to hardcore sci fi fans or gamers, but a lot is left either poorly explained or not explained at all.  I remember there being a lot of debate over it on the message boards.<br />Three stars for the production quality but lopsided final project.  To my understanding there is a sequel planned, hopefully they will work on the acting and writing.  Either way, I'll be there for the spectacle alone.
0743454529|4.0|Like many of her books, My Sister's Keeper is a completing engrossing page turner. I literally could not put it down. The book is written alternately from the perspectives of the main characters, which allows Picoult to provide each character's point of view and the reason behind their decisions. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it (as well any of the Jodi Picoult books!)
B0001ENY6M|4.0|Great, powerful, moving music.  Haunting and memorable.  Echoes many of the great epic Zimmer and Horner scores.<br />However,<br />I heard that James Horner was going to compose the score then Lisa Gerrard. What happened to Lisa Gerrard? I think she would have done an excellent job.  Her new album with Patrick Cassidy, &quot;Immortal Memory&quot; has some songs that sound as if they belong in this movie.  I dunno, but I want to know why she didn't wind up doing the score.<br />And on the newest trailer (not the teaser with the great peter gabriel &quot;Long walk home&quot; song) there is a song that has the same melody of the &quot;Resurrection&quot; song from this soundtrack, except it features the duduk, many other ethnic instruments, and Gerrard's haunting voice. Does anyone know why this wasn't in the movie?  Is there any way to get this song?  Thank you
0201634988|3.0|The CD is EXACTLY like the book.  Yes, you can browse it with a web browser, but it's really not much different.  <br />The thing that really ticks me off is that once you buy it you can't return it because it's a CD.  I specifically bought the CD because it mentioned code samples, so I thought, &quot;Oh that means it has a working implementation of the code samples for me to play with.&quot;<br />The major problem with this book is that the code samples are really all code snippets.  They show you enough code to give you an example, but not enough for you to play with.  It's one thing to read a few lines of code, but another to see the code in action in a full, working program.  So I thought the CD was different.  <br />Nope, it doesn't have a specific section with working code samples... the code samples are the code snippets from the book, you have to cut-and-paste them straight out of the chapter to use them... but you can't because they're not a full working example.  Whoopdeedo!  The samples are only about 10 lines each, you can easily just type it yourself.<br />Don't bother buying the CD, just get the book.  At least with the book you can write on it and underline things.

0060977264|5.0|I enjoyed a lot this book. When you feel love everything is a magic moment. Of course, you shuold be sure about her or him love. Sometimes we don't know who really love us, but, we must to trust on them.<br />     We always hope a true love. It came to us. You can feel the true love, in your heart, in your soul, is a magic moment. Travel with him or her, spend the life togheter, to be only one, with difficults, problems, discuss, but, the love is a powerful thing.
B0000062Y2|4.0|This is an awesome rendition and every actor and actress seems to be very talented.  The sound quality is not the best but the quality of the actors and actresses definatley make up for it.  I personally emjoy the Decca Broadway Original Cast Album better, but the version of it I have is not the full musical, just select songs, which is dissapointing, making this album the best one out there.  Hope you found this helpful!!!

0156027321|5.0|I just finished reading the book, and I am desperately seeking someone to discuss it.  This book is one of two books I could read more than once.

B00004RF97|5.0|Sometimes on cable you see sitcoms or movies from the 1980's and you think they are not funny and terribly outdated. <BR>Not so with the Philadelphia story. It is a terrible funny romantic comedy with three superb actors: Catharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart.<BR>It's about marriage and liking other people. It is very obvious that is is a play and it is also acted out like a play. It is considered one of the best movies ever and I have to agree it was one of the best I have seen lately.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What is it about this album? Is it really just that good? For the longest time I've sonsidered some of my greatest musical experiences to be my first time listening to &quot;Sergeant Pepper's&quot; or &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; but &quot;Ok Computer&quot; put up a valliant fight. I'm not sure if I've ever gotten so caught up in a piece of music. I didn't intened to lose 53 minutes of my day to this music, but I did. The thing is, it wasn't lost time. This album is that good. And there is nothing quite like the first listen to this album. Not even the second listen. It doesn't get old. There is something to every single listen. I'd also like to emphasize that I am not at all a big Radiohead fan. I definitly like &quot;The Bends,&quot; but &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; just don't do it for me. But this one, &quot;Ok Computer&quot; is without a doubt a classic. Arguably the best album of the 90s. Just can't ignore this one. It really is that good.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I was blown away when I saw the Matrix for the first time and still rank it among my favorite movies ever. I was looking forward to the sequel and again it is good. <br />The story continues about Neo fighting in the Matrix with Morpheus and Trinity. The enemies are now more, hundreds of Smiths and a very scary albino twin. There are however too many fighting scenes and sometimes it is very obvious that computer graphics have been used, even for real people. The scene with Neo fighting hundreds of Smith is absurd.<br />But still, the graphics are amazing, the choreography is very worthwhile and the story keeps you thinking as well. I wasn't dissapointed, not at all, so watch it if you liked the Matrix I

B00000I1OY|5.0|I first watched this film..in another language when I was a kid. How best to illustrate the impact it had on me? After 25 years I still remembered the story of it. Of a man swimming home and of the last scene where he coming home to find an empty, isolated house.<br />Flash back to the present. I found this movie by accident in the library. Wondering if it's the same one stuck in my mind for so long so I checked it out. The impact of watching it this time was still there (just a bit less since I already know the ending).<br />All in all it's really worth seeing. It left an unforgettably emotional impact on me..as a 10-year-old child. That's how best I could put it to say how good the movie is.
B000005RFQ|4.0|I personally saw this tour and definitely like the album.  The one thing I didn't like, as with the Dio years, was that though both singers did good for the material on the albums they recorded with Black Sabbath, neither were right to cover the Ozzy songs.  I always found that strange about Iommi, he would get singers that fit great for the new material but weren't the right tone for the previous stuff.  Anyhow, I think this is a good album.  Not for everyone, but not all is!
B00003CXCT|3.0|STAR WARS MOVIES: ARE THE BEST!<br />These are some of the most awesome movies - they will live forever :) And, most likely, go on and on and on and on, really, just like the movie suggests..., but today, before other releases, I have to say : <br />I loved the Star Wars movies from the age of being a kid of six (6), it was interesting for me, today, to see reviews reacting negetivly to the CGI versions (they are interesting, but not true), it is too bad, but you can really tell the difference, I prefer the original versions, some how they are more real, more connecting. In the final DVDs, I hope the originals are present! <br />Adults admire the original. Or shall it we make something, really nice, differnt - please don't dissipoint the audience...we are the thing, the original, the fans...now the parents of the things to come - to come - with<br />It would be great in the future if new releases would have both versions on DVD.<br />I like the films, but for now, they are being put at the lower end of my list of purchases. And, things like the sequences of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Matrix\\" series, are right there! Doing what I want. There are many other high quality movies to mention, but, I love STAR WARS, and I want my STAR WARS!, old and new, give it to me and I will buy. It is that simple and since 1977, wonderfully basic.  (...)
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Twenty minutes into this movie, I laughed out loud. From that point on, I never stopped smiling.  It's now three days later and I haven't stopped smiling.  A movie you want to wrap your arms around and hug, \\"Love Actually\\" is an anthology of love stories involving over a dozen people set in modern pre-Christmas London.    A woefully incomplete list:  Hugh Grant, the new young British PM, falls for his tea server. Newly widowed Liam Neeson bonds with his young stepson. The stepson is hopelessly smitten by a girl in his class named Joanna. Emma Thompson plays the PM's sister, married to Alan Rickman. He is disaffected with his home life, and is flirting with the idea of flirting with his secretary. Laura Linney works for Rickman, and has a crush on a co-worker, but her life is complicated by a mentally ill brother. Two adult film stand-ins develop a sweet relationship while hanging around nude and simulating sex so the film crew can set up for the real deal. The adult film directors' roommate heads to the U.S. because all U.S. women are hot, and they all want to have sex with English men.   Supposedly.   Keira Knightly is a newlywed who discovers someone else may be drawn to her. Bill Nighy steals the film as an aged rock star, angling for the Number One spot on the charts. Writer Colin Firth obsessing about his new Portuguese housekeeper.    Well, you KNOW how this movie is going to end. You really do. It's no surprise.  If it didn't end the way you THOUGHT it would, it would suck.   It's like music. You expect verse-chorus-verse, maybe a guitar solo here or some background vocals there, but the overall pattern is constant. It's the CONTENT that sets it apart.    This film is SO funny, with so many loops and asides, you'll be giddy. It's smart and sweet and heartwarming, all in the best way without being sappy or cloying.    This film is LOADED with uncredited guest stars. I won't spoil all the fun (there's at least a half dozen) but when the daughter from the TV show \\"24\\" showed up, I giggled. Get a load of the guy who plays the President of The United States. An absolute hoot.    The soundtrack is astonishing. An absolutely perfect melding of pop songs/performances to situations. Eva Cassidy's 'Songbird\\" is appropriately aching. The Beach Boys \\"God Only Knows\\" soars. The movie ends with a Christmas pageant performance bringing many (if not all) of the characters together, and little Joanna brings down the house.    While it is a romantic comedy, not every tale has a conventional or happy ending. Some are, yes, but others are bittersweet. Unrequited love. Familial love. The love between best friends, or old friends.   Puppy love, which if you think about it, may be the purest form of true love. You just like somebody, and you don't know or care why. You just do and that's it.   The love of sex. The love of possible sex. Love AFTER sex.   Love of parents, children, brothers, sisters, co-workers and colleagues; the love of cultures, of tradition, of language...    So I guess the overall theme of the film really is just love, actually.
B000001IQH|5.0|that butthead x2 may be OBSESSED with the Clash, but still buy this album. don't listen to him. he probably is a fat french kid who tucks his shirt into his underwear and when he bends over lightning strikes and little gnomes with laser tag guns pop out and run towards the eiffel tower and chew on wet towels in the dirty grass that the Music Fan pooed all ovuh.                This is a great album. It sounds like the clash, yes, but that IS A GOOD THINg (kiss that, Frenchy. i will list the songs not in any order and say the best qualitys of them.  1.Journey to the End- great bass and great chorus  2.Lock sTep and Gone- just plain awesome, dude-man  3.ruby soho- catchy and a good song for a new rancid fan  4.listed mia- i dunno...i just love it, cool cat  5.maxwell murders- THE AWESOMEST BASS SOLO after 1 minute in the song  6.junky man- great song in alot of ways:they also say and out come the wolves in it  7.roots radicals- skateboard song  8.the rest is good
B000089RVX|2.0|This is a fabulous pop album.  The writing is fine, the music is all synth and orchestration, and I don't see what the band did outside of perhaps write a few mediocre guitar riffs and some rough lyrics.  I did buy this record, and I have listened to it about 200+ times!  <br />My major problem with this band is not with the album itself, but with the live performance of Amy Lee.  This woman cannot sing to save her life.  Which leads me to believe that this whole band is a hoax.  A band that's can't pull it off live is worthless.  It's all studio.  I have seen 2 of their shows, (One because I enjoyed the album, and the other because I wanted to give Mrs. Lee a second chance!) and watched about 25 live videos from all over the world.  In each one she can't hit the notes.<br />To make matters worse, she's singing along to her own vocal melody and still can't hit anything!  That's truly bad.  I kept giving them chances, but each time she just kept sucking.  <br />The bottom line is that this whole band is all studio tricks. <br />They also are in desperate need of about 3-5 honest road experience before they're ready to play arenas.  They just don't have the stage presence for it yet.  The first time I saw them that was one of the first things I noticed was that nobody in the group seemed to know how to \\"fill the room\\".  Then I went and looked on their site and found out that they had almost never played live before they were signed.  That is really bad.  It takes about 5-7 years for the average band to break, and that includes live shows and some touring.  Evanescence just doesn't have that.  Not even close.  The one saving grace is that they probably made the label enough money to hire coaches for that sort of stuff.<br />I'll skip the next album, and get the 3rd one.  Or maybe a live one after they've had a chance to cook a bit more!
B000268QB2|5.0|What a great cd.  The first track, &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; was what hooked me to Keane in the first place.  Its a great debut with chilling lyrics and chorus melodies you'll be humming in your head all day.<br />The lead's voice is simple, strong, emotional, but never grating on your nerves.  I hope to hear lots more from him in the near future.
0767805712|4.0|Gattaca<br />Andrew Niccol makes his film début with Gattaca (1997).  Born in New Zealand he is also a screen writer and director.  He directed TV commercials in London before moving to Los Angles, where he felt that he could do something with more substance than commercials.    Niccol actually made our deepest fantasies come true with this sci-fi thriller film.   One is reminded of Orwell's book 1984, which also delves into the mind of the devious, not to mention Lois Lowry's book, The Giver.  Both authors, along with Niccol give us glimpses into a futurist world where society is stratified; life is pretty much predictable for the privileged, those not so well endowed have to scrounge for their very existence.  The message here is that we need to face our deepest fears and conquer them.  We have the means at our disposal to do anything that we want or put our minds to do.  <br />Niccol's use of dark and light portrayed sinister happenings, which had to be hid from the authorities.   The hiding in the shadows, added to the drama of the situation where Vincent (Ethan Hawke) was almost caught by his brother, in a nightclub, where by societal standards he was not allowed to be as an invalid.  Vincent found that he was able to achieve his dream, though not without help along the way.  Even though he lived in a closed society, he managed to escape from living the life of the marginalized.<br />One of the two major thoughts that came from this movie for me is how we as a society are not really that far from the practice of eugenetics.  Eugenetics is the practice of genetically altering the gene pool, DNA of a species.   While this film shows that practice in the form of shifting out unwanted traits; i.e. obesity, and other harmful physical conditions, one thing that could not be genetically altered was the spirit or soul of the individual.   Each person is an individual which thinks differently and uniquely from any one else.  The possibilities are endless, especially since this technology is already in use for cancer treatments.   But reality also shows that not everything shows up in the genes of individuals.  <br />The other thought brings into focus much of what has been happening in the development of identification technology.  The use of lasers to identify individual through their eye imprints, is now available in certain secure government facilities.   The future may be nearer than we think.

0553278223|4.0|Bradbury came up with a totally original idea of instead of having the aliens the ones who come to our planet and explore, it is instead the humans who are the curious ones and search mars for life. Bradbury mixes the old and the new by having the humans and aliens switch roles when it comes to alien abductions.<br />I, personally, like how Bradbury gave all the Martians telepathy, which enabled them to speak in all languages. But since all the aliens are telepathic they all know what everyone else does which makes the story much more interesting and a lot more difficult to write. That¡¯s why I admire Bradbury¡¯s work. I also enjoy how Bradbury doesn't follow the other books in the alien genre. This new idea has discovered a new form of Martian science fiction. <br />Although Bradbury didn't give much thought to creating the characters' names, he did a wonderful job on creating an exciting page-turner that has an interesting new twist at every page. Bradbury can always find away to make each page unique and exciting, whether it¡¯s sending the humans to a Martian insane asylum or having the Martians move to the planet earth. I believe that this book will be the start of a whole new way of writing alien books.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This might generate some ire but bear with me. After trying on several occasions to find out what people saw in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I just gave up on it. I didn't get its popularity and probably never will. Then the buzz about Angel and Firefly became all too apparent. Living abroad with very limited access to American TV allowed me to miss both of those shows (Firefly never even aired). Then, a very good friend who fell out of love with Buffy suggested that I rent the series Firefly when it became available. It took me several months to break down and give the failed series a try. What a wonderful &quot;failure&quot;! This was an adult, engaging, well casted and very well written series. And the executive heads at FOX who determine what should stay and what should go need to get their heads examined. Ironically this happens to a lot of series that I like, but in this case I was disappointed after the fact.Firefly was quality television with sympathetic characters who soon became family. After renting the first disc I had to see the rest and saw the entire series within 5 days.The reason I only give the series 4 stars is because I feel cheated by this series early demise, and the evident lack of information that was so well hinted at but never resolved due to that abrupt ending. This isn't the best that television has had to offer but it's much better than &quot;very entertaining&quot; and well worth owning the set.There is the hope that more Firefly is coming as a feature film. Perhaps there is some justice in the world of entertainment.
0679805273|4.0|This is my \\"staple\\" high school graduation gift.  It's a great gift for the graduate with or without money tucked inside.  It talks about life, both the good and the bad, but ends with a positive message.  The kids I've given it to have all seemed to love it...especially at 18, sometimes you just want to sit down with Dr. Suess and be a kid again.  It does get a little slow at certain parts, but in general I'd say it's a good book with a great message.
B00003CXB2|5.0|David Lean's &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; starring Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence, is a masterpiece of movie making and surely deserving of its \\"Best Picture\\" award in 1962.<br />As fine and gifted an actor as O'Toole has been throughout his distinguished career, his portrayal of Lawrence was truly magnificent and flawless.  From \\"Lawrence\\" to \\"Becket\\" to \\"The Lion in Winter\\" and \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips,\\" and other wonderful performances - which earned him an honorary Academy Award in 2002 for his \\"remarkable talents [that] have provided cinema history with some of its most memorable characters\\" - his performance as Lawrence still stands out.<br />The DVD contains extra footage detailing the difficulties and Herculean effort required over two and a half years, in brutal heat that reached 135 degrees; however, the end result is Hollywood at its finest, perhaps unequaled by recent movie making.  Steven Spielberg, among others, extols the movie's virtues.<br />For those interested in the pure beauty of its photography, unaided by today's computer-assisted \\"everything,\\" \\"Lawrence\\" is moving making at its best.  Lean was a taskmaster, but the results speak for themselves and will endure long after today's films are forgotten.  It is a classic.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|A friend of mine said his 15-year-old son saw this movie and commented on how awful it was.  While I can see how this film won't appeal to teenagers, I couldn't disagree more.  This is a really entertaining romantic comedy with superb performances by the great comedic actress Diane Keaton (Erica Barry) as a somewhat uptight playwright and the venerable Jack Nicholson (Harry Sanborn) as a successful businessman with a reputation for only dating young women.  Amanda Peet also delivers a good performance as Erica Barry's daughter Marin, who is also dating Harry Sanborn.  <br />This is a film that shows some of the pains of growing older and, in the case of Nicholson's character, the process of finally growing up.  Anyone who enjoys good, if mature, romantic comedies and appreciates excellent acting and writing should see this.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Okay i'll get this out of the way, the music is still hard and the core.... THE CORE of the band as far as music goes is still intact and still is some of the hardest stuff i've ever listened to, the music is great<BR>I begin listening to it with my friend who just bought the cd, me and him are both OLD slipknot fans, we're listening to it and corey's voice is different is the first thing i reckignize, then he begins to sing, that kinda started to scare me but i figured everyone's got to change sometime right, i mean you can't make everything sound the same or else you become a corprate sell out like linkin park (did a deal with aol) or staind (still wrighting about the same girl that hurt him like 10 years ago) now granted it's not fair to judge one band by another, but using that as an example i figured hey they gotta change or else they'll suck more<BR>I knew that once corey came back from the stonesour stuff that he'd want to sing and i was kinda all for it i bought the stone sour cd and it was decent and i wondered how it'd sound so coming into this i had a good frame of mind to listen to it.<BR>This cd would be great... if it was instrumental, corey has turned his back on what slipknot was founded on, i counted to times he screamed on the album and it only took 2 hands, screaming is part of the core nature of slipknot everyone knows that.......<BR>so let me say this, the album is good musically but skip track 6 or it'll make you almost vomit anything you've eaton that day, like it did me
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant collaborate again in this light, somewhat sentimental, romantic comedy.  The film features a great cast which includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney and an especially hilarious performance by Bill Nighy.  The movie is set at Christmastime and follows the sometimes interconnected lives of numerous couples.  This isn't great art and isn't meant to be.  It is, however, really good entertainment and a nice way to spend a couple of hours.

1592400876|5.0|After reading several magazine articles about this book, I realized I just had to pick it up.  Although I was mildly tripped up by the Britishisms, I fell into the pace of the book fairly easily.  Truss had me howling with laughter and on more than one occasion I was heard to yelp, &quot;Yes! I know! Aren't people stupid?&quot; from the comfort of my couch.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who has taken a red pen to their boss' memos (guilty!).
B000127LW2|1.0|Paramount gave little thought to Voyager maintaining the Star Trek franchise.  It was treated as the &quot;Money Making Monster&quot; that 'Star Trek' has become. Greed relentlessy dictacted the direction Voyager would take - AUTO DESTRUCT! <br />* It's all but impossible not to compare it to the other Star Trek series.  Voyager is the worst of them all. Deep Space Nine is by far the best! <br />* Voyager dwells too much on their return home and give it a &quot;Lost In Space&quot; feel - corny, stupid, dull and overly dependent on the special effects, i.e. read that as 'weak story'.  <br />* The characters weren't quite 'real' and as they developed the writers put the wrong people in certain situations Ex. Janeway would head missions just like Kirk did, a blatant abuse of protocol.  Sometimes Tuvok (a full Vulcan) would be the most emotional character!  Most of the rest of the cast would move from overwhelming a story to just 'disappearing'.  The ensemble cast element rarely existed and when it did the actors were most likely 'out of character'. For the sake of screen time?  <br />* There were some fine episodes (none that I can think of in Season 1) but even most of my favorites wouldn't make my best of list against Next Generation, DS9 or even some of the Original series! <br />* Being Star Trek you would expect nothing short of great packaging (consensus says no) but Paramount is just peddling something the fans are so addicted to that they will buy it in droves, no matter the packing or...<br />* High price for a short season, which is also one of the worst as far as stories go.  It makes Next Generations' season one look brilliant (it wasn't).<br />* The sad truth is the market was prepared for the onslaught of sales of a so-so series at a very high price with the poorest of packaging and the extreme hard core fans have left everyone else wondering why?  Save your money, watch the reruns.
B000003S5H|2.0|First off, I bought this after purchasing many chillout discs. In total, I own over 500 CD's.  I listen to a lot of music and I am very selective. <br />This album is not five stars or even close in my opinion.  First, I hardly call most of these cuts 'songs.'  They play more like experimental music tracks where vocals are an after thought.  The guys shouldn't be singing.  Period. The so called hit Sexy Boy is annoying, Remember is ridiculously sentimental nothingness and Talisman sounds like a piano riff in which they just kept piling on the sound effects. I gave this a chance, listend to it five times over a month and I grew less and less interested and more and more annoyed.  Granted, Talkie Walkie is better.<br />(...)
B000066NW0|5.0|You know the young stars of today and how they get started. They come from little shows (Britney, Christina, Jessica Simpson) or win contests like the American Idol winners. Well this is one girl who didn't have a push from anywhere and didn't need it. She came out of nowhere and put out an album that was simply put A 10 from beginning to end. The music is new, it's fresh, it's original and it varies from song to song. Avril Lavigne's style is exactly what I like, emotional, showing true feelings, and tells alot about her personality and her life. It's not simply party music that doesn't mean anything, She doesn't follow the trend of today in which everything is about sex. She wants to be known for her tallent not her sexuality and for that I admire and respect her. To all the haters out there maybe you should think about that fact and actually listen to her music before being judgemental. Avril, I wish there were more girls like you.
B000002U9W|5.0|If over 23 minutes of the albums title track does not display the bands layering musical talent yet, perhaps you should stick with the hits and move on to other artists.<br />This is, no doubt, the beginning of the band's vision which would eventually lead to Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall.<br />Listen, think, listen again, enjoy!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|THIS DEFINATELY HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DVD'S EVER MADE BY THIS BAND WHICH WAS ALL ABOUT HAVING LOADS OF TALENT AND SUBSTANCE.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL LOVERS OF GOOD ROCK MUSIC.ONLY A JERK COULD GIVE THIS GREAT DVD ONE STAR.A MUST HAVE
B000002UA5|4.0|Of this double CD/Album, disk one is a live recording of classic Floyd which every Floyd enthusiast MUST have.  The quality is outstanding.  If the roar of the crowd had not been included at the end of each set you could swear it had been recorded in the studio.<br />Disk two IS a studio recording.  Each of the four members of the band (David Gilmour now replacing Syd Barrett who simply stopped showing up to play at live events) created a song of their own.  Did it work?  Possibly not, but each creation has it's own feel.  Very interresting stuff.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I'm convinced that everyone reviewing this cd must be a linkin park fan or nickelback or some crappy music. OK! Hooray for slipknot changing and becoming artists yay! BAH! IF they wanted to change they should of doen it on there second cd. Thats what most bands do. I cant believe i'm saying this but slipknot is turning into metals Insane Clown Posse. When ICP first came out there music was different and everyone liked it. But as they progressed they started to suck more and slipknot is following the same path. Also Maggotts is turning into a &quot;Juggalos&quot; type thing to me. Hopefully slipknot realises this album isnt good and quickly releases another album to make up for it just like Korn did with Untouchables, god that cd sucked. People say read the lyrics, I HAVE NO DESIRE TO!, the songs suck so bad that I dont even feel like seeing one word of the song. People are saying that everyones just mad because theres no cussing or all they like is metal and dont see why all we want is brutal and not art, well slipknot made themselves out to be brutal on the first albums! Thats like all of a sudden Tool changes to rap metal and starts singing like Fred Durst. Just dont buy the cd. Download it then erase it.
B000002U9Y|4.0|Pink Floyd started as an underground band playing a 20 minute long &quot;jam&quot; tune called &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and this album was created to appease the original fan base.<br />Still very lyrical, the music also begins to increase in quality.  As Syd Barrett began to distance himself not only from the band but also from reality, the other members began to fill the void ... and very well.<br />Syd's talent still comes through on a few of the tracks to create a very good album.<br />Still, this is an album for the collector or the die-hard Floyd fam.
0671027387|4.0|I read this book b/c I loved The Da Vinci Code so much.  It is very different than TDC, which is good (Angels &amp; Demons was a disappointment!).  I thought the story was fresh with lots of twists and turns.  A quick read that pulls you in!
B000002UA0|3.0|After the release of a runaway single (Arnold Layne), Floyd hit the studio to record this odd but very lyrical creation, written by Syd Barrett.  Barrett did not adjust to fame (or drugs) very well and quickly left the band halfway through the second album.<br />This recording has some great pieces, but is essentially for the collector or the die hard Pink Floyd fan.
0780018664|4.0|If he did it could have been Fritz Lang & his seminal talkie, M, made in 1931 & released in 1933. A deranged child murderer is loose in the city (played broadly & wonderfully by \\"newcomer,\\" Peter Lorre).    The movie has scenes pitting citizen v. citizen, in accusations & counter accusations, near lynchings & mob hysteria. The police seem helpless & bereft of clues. Organized crimes seeks to find the murderer also. He's bad for business.     Crowd mentality is examined. It is a theme Lang returns to in later movies. His first American movie, Fury , (1936) deals with vigilantism & mob rule. This version, a poor print by the way, has English subtitles so you're forced to pay attention. It was Lang's favorite film. It is a prototype, if you will, of the murder mystery genre. Kind of a precursor to Hitchcock's thrillers of the 40's & 50's.
B000002J1S|5.0|Genesis' greatest work, and perhaps the best thing to come out of the Prog genre, despite a complete nonsense &quot;plot,&quot; this record manages to hang together beautifully over four sides of vinyl, a feat not equalled by any of their contemporaries; many tried the double concept album, no one else succeeded in creating something worth listening to all the way through. <BR>The key to this feat was the band's intense focus on SONGS (fancy that), not epic monstrosities (Jon anderson, I'm looking at you here), and tight production. Sure, there are bleeps and bloops and weirdy beardy noisy things going on here and there, but this is no Van der Graaf generator LP. The music is beautiful, and the lyrics, though patently silly (a sin of which pretty much everyone at the time was guilty), are very evocative and contain such gems as &quot;Erogenous zones I love you!&quot; Ranging from Beatles-derived pop to the far reaches of Progressiveness (for want of a better term), the tracks strike a wonderful balance of styles and give the ear more than a few hooks on which to hang its hat. Like &quot;2112&quot; for Rush or &quot;Fragile&quot; for Yes, &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; is the pure unalloyed refined essence of its creators. You really should buy it.
0714843377|4.0|It's a shot in the arm and a kick in the pants. This is a to-the-point book that helps you &quot;conquer the high dive&quot;.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Wow this cd is 100% awesome. It's the most diverse slipknot album yet and arguably their best (or maybe second best, next to their classic self-titled). The mixing of the trademark chaotic sound of the 'Knot, and their new-found melodic and mellower side makes this cd a must own for die-hard Maggots as well as metalheads in general. It's so brutal and at the same time wonderful, i haven't stopped listening to it since I got it 3 days ago. I highly recommend this cd to any respecting fan of good music. Thank you so much to Slipknot for always keeping the music heavy, heart-felt and REAL.<br />Now for my Song Ratings:<br />1. Prelude(9/10)- Cool intro to start off the album. It instantly gives you a hint that this cd is gonna sound different than older ones.<br />2. The Blister Exists(10/10)- Heavy as f*ck, great riffs, catchy chorus and a killer marching band-like intermission at the middle.<br />3. Three Nil(9/10)- Features some fast drumming from Joey &amp; melodic vocals from Corey.   <br />4. Duality(10/10)- One of the best tracks on the album. Ultra-catchy chorus! Make sure to check out the rad video they made for it.<br />5. Opium of the People(9/10)- Fast-paced song, some sick guitar riffs, and again a melodic chorus<br />6. Circle(10/10)- First acoustic song on the CD. Beautiful vocals, and cool drum beats at the end.<br />7. Welcome(9/10)- Really heavy track, crazy screaming and a short but sweet guitar solo.<br />8. Vermilion(10/10)- Best track on the album. Has some Marilyn Manson-esque sound effects, creepy vocals, and an irrestible sing-along-to chorus. Also a cool guitar solo, and a classic ending.<br />9. Pulse of the Maggots(9/10)- Promises to be the new favorite at the mosh pits, awesome guitar solo, chanting, a new dedication to the true fans.<br />10. Before I Forget(8/10)- My 2nd least-liked track on the album, though it's a common favorite of many. The lyrics, flow of the songs and even the chorus itself just don't quite appeal to me as the othersongs do.<br />11. Vermilion, Pt. 2(10/10)- The second acoustic song. To sum it up, a very awesome song. Great lead and back-up vocals. A haunting and beautiful track, it's probably my current favorite.<br />12. The Nameless(10/10)- Wild screaming, kick-a$$ riffs and another super-catchy chorus. This song represents the album's overall feel- heavy yet melodic. <br />13. The Virus of Life(7/10)- The song I like least. It just seems to be missing something to give it an edge. A slow song with serious screaming but doesn't really go anywhere.<br />14. Danger - Keep Away(10/10)- The third 'quiet' song, which ends the album. Good blending of Corey's voice and the back-ups.
B00003CXDV|4.0|This film was very enjoyable to watch.  The plot itself may seem over-the-top and ridiculous, but the filmmakers managed to pull it off extremely well, almost to some point of believablity!<br />The humour is great, not falling on the floor hilarious, but definately a nice light comedy and the cast is superb, many excellent actors show there face in this film.  Most of all, one can identifiy with the characters easily, they all have such diverse traits, it's simple to understand where they're coming from.  <br />This is a great sit and down watch it movie when you just need a movie to watch. Highly enjoyable, funny and somewhat enlightening for the presumably simple story, I recommend this film to anyone on their on quest for a good afternoon movie.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Underworld is already one of the best Vampire movies without being extended or tampered with. But the extended version makes it better nonetheless. This DVD is also packed with Extra Featured that go way deeper into the making of the movie than the one disc DVD. If you love and cherish Blade, Blade 2, Dracula, Dracula 2000, and Van Helsing you are sure to love Underworld.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|okay...so i have never liked avril at all..not one tincy bit...but i decided to give her another chance. i borrowed her new album from a friend...and the verdict is..she still sucks. her lyrics are about boys and stupid little people..and she still can't sing or play the guitar. she is just a sad poser.
B0001HAISG|5.0|&quot;Peter Pan&quot; is such a great movie on so many levels that I don't even know where to begin!  This film is no doubt director P.J. Hogan's crowning masterpiece.  <br />After years of being portrayed variously by grown women, cartoon characters, and an aging Robin Williams, Peter Pan finally reclaims his youthful boyishness in this first, and perhaps most faithful rendition of the classic story.  The casting is superb from top to bottom.  Unlike other versions, Hogan doesn't shy away at using young, talented actors and thus refuses to compromise realism.  Jeremy Sumpter is fitting and delightful as the title role.  However, it is the beautiful Rachel Hurd-Wood (whose name doesn't even appear on the DVD jacket!  What a travesty!)  who completely steals the show, and stole my heart!  :-)  Possibly the most gorgeous thing ever to walk the earth with her impossibly adorable eyes, the precocious Hurd-Wood combines her physical beauty with incredible depth in her acting.  Her chemistry with fellow young actor Jeremy crackles with unusual intensity for ones so young.  <br />This version of the Peter Pan story includes a sweet, adorable romance between Wendy and Peter that is the real centrepiece of the film.  Hogan doesn't sell us short, nor does he shy away at portraying young love in a positive light, in all its sweet, innocent glory.  There's nothing to be ashamed of here; Hogan chooses to acknowledge that 13 year-olds fall in love too.  The &quot;fairy mid-air dance&quot; between Wendy and Peter is one of the sweetest and most romantic scenes in recent cinematic history.  And the final &quot;thimble&quot;!  Wow!  I won't ruin it for you guys.  :)  Let's just say, the true power of love is unleashed to save the day.  And none of it would have worked if not for the genuine chemistry between the two young leads, whom I am told are good friends in real life.  (Jeremy has expressed romantic interest in Rachel, but unfortunately it is not reciprocated)<br />Jason Isaacs must also be given special mention for is phenomenal performance as the one and only Captain James Hook, AND Wendy's father!  I couldn't tell until someone told me; wow!  Now THAT's acting!  Isaac gives probably the finest portrayal of Hook ever, AT LEAST on par with (if not surpassing) Dustin Hoffman's also fine performance.  Isaacs gives Hook a level of emotional depth that I did not expect.  Indeed we find it difficult not to empathise with the lonely, emotionally scarred captain, and can't help but wonder what skeletons hide in the closet of his past.  <br />However, I must note that the greatest thing about this film is also its biggest problem;  whether purposely or unwittingly, Hogan has ended up making a version of Peter Pan whose target audience are adults.  The film is much too nuanced, layered, and complex to be fully enjoyed by children.  And it's much too serious.  For the first time, the irony of Peter Pan's existence is explored.  Pan's greatest gift is simultaneously his eternal curse; he cannot grow up, and thus he cannot receive his would-be girlfriend's love, nor can he live a full life.  As Wendy said &quot;You say you don't feel, but I think that is your biggest pretend&quot;.  This complexity to Peter's character is fully exploited by the writers (and Hook) in the final battle between Hook and Peter.  Even though Peter technically  wins (through the triumph of love ;-), in a brilliant twist), we see that in the end, both Peter and Hook are essentially tragic characters, trapped in a similar curse.  And, if this really had been a dark parody of the classic fairy tale for adults, I would suggest that the film should have ended with Peter lying on the deck of the Jolly Roger, exhausted and defeated not by Hook's sword, but by the unbearable truth of his words; this is how Peter Pan finally dies.  <br />Another level of complexity lies in the fact that Jason Isaacs plays both Wendy's father and Hook.  One can interpet this entire adventure as Wendy's own imagination.  <br />The special effects of the film must also be given a mention; they are gorgeous and superbly done.  Hogan has a distinctive style that beautifully gives live-action film a fantasy, almost cartoonish feel without sacrificing the realism and intellectual undertones of the movie.  The mermaids were my favourite.  Our familiar flippered friends are given a sinister, otherworldly look.  Tinkerbell is also very well done, played by the delightfully expressive French actress Ludivine Sagnier.<br />Alas, this is still technically a children's movie, and everyone ends smiling (except Hook, of course).  Children will indeed enjoy this movie, but in the words of Dr. Frink from &quot;the Simpsons&quot;, &quot;You won't enjoy it on NEARLY as many levels as I will!&quot;  &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is a multilayered and complex treat of social psychology and anthropology.  It is a very mature and philosophically rich movie.  It can be enjoyed as a fantasy, a coming-of-age story, a very sweet romance, and/or an unapologetic and fearless analysis of Peter Pan's hidden, background themes.  This movie will not disappoint the discerning viewer.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is an absolutely riviting documentary about one of the most important, and controversial, American personalities of the 20th century.  It is impossible to be objective about this film; my reaction to it was totally colored by coming of age and being immersed in that era.<br />McNamara was, for those of us alive in the 1960s, either a stone-cold intellectual genius, the perfect egghead CEO, a heartless  calculating machine, or a war criminal. The beauty of Morris' film is he lets the prisoner tell his tale from the dock (kind of like &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;) and seemingly does not take sides.  If the rules of karma hold sway, Mcnamara should be reborn as a bannana slug as he cheerfully excuses his responsibility for Vietnam - &quot;only 20,000 were killed when I was in office - the rest happened later.&quot;<br />Part of the problem with McNamara is he is the intellectual's intellectual, a hyper achiever who cut his teeth perfecting incindiary bombing of Japanese cities. His flair with numbers management drew him to revive Ford in the 1950s, and then his rise to true stardom as the brightest of Kennedy's intellectual lights.  His adroit handling of the 1962 Cuban Crisis remains required reading in political science circles, and for that, he is justly proud in standing up to the Joint Chiefs as they sought to blow the lids off of missile silos. However, one gets the feeling his problem with nuclear war is simply one of degree and proportionality, not morality.<br />The film prods him into his Vietnam disaster.  &quot;Mistakes were made&quot; admits McNamara, but anyone expecting tears or even an apology are bound to be disappointed.  Even in his advanced years, his overweaning ego is in full display, and even his self-criticism sounds like a daily Dow Jones summary.  Herein lies  the root of the problem, and the intense sadness when Johnson (the  polar opposite of McNamara's East Coast brahmin) parts company with him.<br />McNamara would claim that he scripts this film (the &quot;eleven lessons&quot;) but the twelth, and unspoken lesson, is that of hubris.<br />This is a must-see, essential Vietnam film, which will age far, far better than more contemporary documentaries like &quot;Hearts and Minds.&quot;  It is, alas, full of lessons the current administration has not heeded.scripts this film (the &quot;eleven lessons&quot;) but the twelth, and unspoken lesson, is that of hubris.<br />This is a must-see, essential Vietnam film, which will age far, far better than more contemporary documentaries like &quot;Hearts and Minds.&quot;  It is, alas, full of lessons the current administration has not heeded.
B000050FEN|1.0|As many reviewers have noted, this movie represents so much.... It is such a perfect reflection on a sick and numbed society that would hold this up in such high regard. It is a good reflection on the sickness of the people involved in producing this work. And I mean that sincerely, because I realize it took so very much time and effort to produce this film. And it is a reflection on the lack of ... lack of what? within the actors who took part in this! By the end of this film I, too, like some other reviewers here, was angry. Angry that I had wasted my time, angry that I had watched such tripe, angry at myself for having listened to and paid attention to all the praise that had been heaped upon this movie when it first came out. This movie still sticks in my mind as one of those that never needed to be made. It is that bad.

0451169514|5.0|Up until I saw the tv mini-series adaptation of the Stephen King novel \\"It\\", I didn't think much of clowns. Then I saw \\"It\\". I never saw clowns in the same light again, and I don't mean that in a good way either. So after getting the bezjeebus scared out of me by Tim Curry as the walking freakshow Pennywise the clown, I just had to read the book version. For the most part, the movie did stay faithful to the book but obviously the film had to edit certain parts of the book to keep the movie within a certain amount of tv time. It is hard for me to pick which I enjoyed more. Both the movie and the book were enjoyable. I loved getting the living daylights scared out of me. \\"It\\" is truly one of the few books/movies that literally freaked me out (not to mention made me hate clowns with passion). Although \\"It\\" is a very thick book, I will have to say that once you are into the book, getting through the pages won't be a problem. I found \\"It\\" to be completely engrossing whenever I read it. Sure the book is slightly different from the mini-series but I can't really complain. \\"It\\" is by far my favorite Stephen King book of all time.

B00000K0EA|3.0|Years after Ian Fleming's death the &quot;James Bond&quot; series rolls on, recycling the original stories for audiences who never read the original novels. Their villains were in turn Soviet KGB, then organized crime; now one of the most powerful publishers in the Free World! Is Fleming turning over in his grave? This film shows how a powerful publisher can create the news, and not just distort it (use your own example). [Will the viewers make the connection to the Real World?] &quot;Eliot Carver&quot; seems to be modeled after Robert Maxwell (was he the front man for powerful forces who stayed in the background?) There are changes to reflect modern culture and political correctness. James Bond still circulates among high-levels to gather information. But one scene shows him overindulging in vodka, as if to suggest a growing problem in an aging operative.<br />Bond is caught snooping in the villain's lair, but makes his escape despite the efforts of many guards (who are of various races for this equal opportunity employer, and also recalls Bond's enemies from past films). A former lover of Bond's is murdered (as in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;). The killer in the hotel room looks like he was recycled from &quot;Doktor Strangelove&quot;. The car chase in the indoor parking lot recalls &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, but is more spectacular. The skydiving to the wrecked ship recalls other films. Bond and Wai Lin (the female Chinese operative) are caught and brought before Eliot Carver (another recurring scene from Fleming's novels). The villain never delegates these tasks. Their escape shows the product placement of BMW and Land Rover (and reminds me of a Jackie Chan film). They escape the Heckler &amp; Koch MP-5 firing villains. The attack scene in the shop recalls another Jackie Chan film, with its choreographed ballet of action. [Could this ever happen in the real world?] I suspect the scenes in Asia were for that market of film viewers.<br />The final scene in the &quot;stealth boat&quot; recalls many earlier Bond films. But Eliot Carver seems to be lacking in a villainous character, unlike the classic Bond villains. [Imagine Pee Wee Herman as Goldfinger?] The ending is full of sound and fury, symbolizing the defeat of the villain, his henchmen, and the Plan for World Domination. The earlier Bond films seemed to have had wittier dialogue. The most surprising thing about this film is its villain: a powerful businessman in the Free World, not a parvenu who attacks one of the British Monopolies and has links to the Soviets or the ChiComs.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|like everyone else, i think the noose is the best song on this album by far, but there are a few others i think are worth listening to as well. i have not been to exposed to this kind of music, i am used to vanessa carlton and michelle branch. i am still impressed with this different style of music. the song i like the least is the nurse who loved me. that is soo random!! anyway, the 2 fillers arent so great either. my fave's are weak and powerless, the noose, blue, and gravity. the outsider is good, but it is so angry, i will have to get used to that. over all a very good cd, well worth the 20 dollars.
0553103547|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest fantasy series' ever written. It is not really classic fantasy at first because of the minor but growing influence of magic, but the story is unimaginably intricate and involved. Definitely not your standard heroes quest formula fantasy.<br />Squemish readers beware, this is a gritty novel with violence, sex and swearing, but all of this adds to the reality of the story. No character is safe, in fact I threw this book down on the floor at two or three points, promising to never read any more...but I couldn't stay away.<br />I've read and enjoyed a lot of good fantasy, bad fantasy, and everywhere in between, but I have never been so engaged by any other story with the possible exception of Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|that is how to summarize anyone who has given this cd anything less than 3 stars, who are screaming sell out sell out!  These are lonely losers who want to listen to crap music where a guitar is raped and the vocalist screams words that one cannot comprehend so that they can feel they are individuals who do not give in to mainstream radio music.  Slipknot themselves said this is their best record and I agree with them.  If you need a swear word to be in a song for you to like it, then you must have severe problems.  Every review on here that is bad is written by people who don't know anything about music.  I read someone referring Slipknot to Nickleback.  This is the same kind of dumbass that calls the band &quot;In Flames&quot; a Korn wanna-be that I heard on the radio.  Each new album Slipknot is releasing is getting better and better, and if you cant see that maybe you should see a therapist because you have deep emotional issues that need to be settled by a person screaming swears.  You can get the same effect by going into the room of a woman going into labor, save your $15.  I advise you to pick up this album.
B00005R2M3|5.0|It just keeps me moving.  I loved it!  All of the songs are pretty deep if you look into them, but if you don't, the style is just so fresh to the U.S.
B000002KET|4.0|Black sabbath in my opinion is the greatest hard rock band of all time. And with their fifth effort Sabbath bloody Sabbath they really stretched their sound. though none of the songs are really considered &quot;heavy&quot; but they all have great poetry and sound. though i must say that the track entitled &quot;who are you?&quot; definitley suffers from over synthesizing. but all the other songs are gold. this nearly flawless album is a true masterpeice. a must have for any metal collection. <br />the best songs on this album are: sabbath bloody sabbath, a national acrobat, fluff, killing yourself to live, and a spiral architect
B00004XOWM|1.0|This album suck like a PoP Mc Hammer album but with electric guitard and a real drum. Get your copy..... and put that crap in the garbage!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|If you've only seen the American trailer for this film, you are probably expecting a very different movie than what will arrive in your mailbox. <br />The trailer made this look like a fluffy feel-good comedy with one central plot, and not much more. But you'll find much more than that in Love Actually. If you want something to make you laugh, cry, think, ache and swell with emotion, this is the one for you. You WILL find a bit of yourself in one of the movie's excellent characters. If you want a movie you can watch without thinking, this also isn't for you. You need to be a tiny bit smart and observant to enjoy this I think. <br />I have only very minor complaints about the movie...subtle changes that would have rounded out the few rough edges. Most every line of the Portuguese sister should have been cut. Instead of comic relief they took away from the scene. In certain scenes the way the shot is set up makes what's about to happen too predictable. <br />That said, the screenplay is phenomenal, as are the actors. Maybe I'm too sentimental, or maybe I love British film and television too much to be an unbiased American reviewer. But I think this film is more than a pretty package. Watch it and then watch it again. I did and I loved it even more the second time. <br />The posterboard &quot;flashcard scene&quot; is worth the price of admission. <br />The soundtrack is great. The Seinfeld way it all ties together is brilliant. And also in the Seinfeld vein, if your friends ask you what the movie is about, you can say &quot;nothing&quot; and mean it. I mean, it's about love. But there's no plot. It's just actually just love. Or love, actually. <br />Lots of nudity and language, definitely not for the kids.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Go to her web site, or here, and give the songs a listen.  If you're into really heavy metal or hardcore punk, you may not like it, but she does have some good rock on here.  She's a rock chick who really gave a good effort for this album.  These may be categorized as pop, but definately have a rock sound to them.  The songs are catchy, and also are pretty good.  Worth the money for it.
B000268QB2|5.0|I have a bad habit. I purchase lots of CDs based on whether or not the \\"look\\" cool, without even hearing them. I've done it many times, with some great results (Damien Rice \\"O\\", Josh Rouse \\"Under the Cold, Blue Stars\\").  Sometimes I miss all together, but this is not the case. With Keane's latest effort, I did indeed like it right away, but I kept listening to it.  After about 3 or 4 rotations of this (unfortunately) short disc, I was in love. The simplistic yet somehow lush arrangements filled my need for new piano-driven Brit-Rock with feeling. And wow! What a voice. I do not like to draw comparisons for any band, but if you enjoy artists such as Ron Sexsmith and especially Travis, you will like this record, provided you listen to it enough.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Borrow it from a friend or listen to it here or her web site.  The songs are pretty good, and also catchy.  She's not hardcore punk, but has evolved nicely into a rock chick.  This album is worth the money.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is an excellent band. This album,&quot;Parachutes&quot;, is just perfect. It's a nice clean cd that you can just chill to and relate to any time you fill like just laying back. Their words and music flows perfectly together and just blends through ~ next song to the next. Parachutes is a good name for the way this album moves. <BR>   <BR>   1. It starts off with a song titled &quot;Don't Panic&quot; which is a great one to start the story off. It softly plays with a acoustic guitar in the background. Then with its' foot beating beat kicks off with Chris' deep taking his time voice. The song flows into &quot;We live in a beautiful world.&quot; The song moves where with all the different soothing sounds you can get lost in it.<br />   2. The next is more up to beat where after the last you just want to move with it. This one is titled &quot;Shiver.&quot; Believe me chris' high going voice with the jammen guitar is enough to really fall in love with. Got to love that up to beat drummer in the back.<br />   3. &quot;Spies&quot; is another softer song that as a great story. The story alone is just great. It takes you down a crying road then all of a sudden climaxes to a good ending you were not expecting putting a smile on your face. The music is a sad that sound with a high pitch guitar coming in with it and of course Chris' voice is perfectly added to the mix. This is indeed on of my favorites.<br />   4. &quot;Sparks&quot; is another love song that just is so cool sounden! The bass is here is greatness it just ties everything together. The guitar gently keeps its beat with the small smashing of simbuls in the back. Then a great sound of another soft guitar plays in and out. <br />   5. Then &quot;Yellow&quot; probably most up to beat one. You probably heard it for it was popular. If you haven't listen to it it's great the soft going group of voices with guitar jam.<BR>       <BR> 1,000 word maximum! crap! Any way a whole page wouldn't do for this cd. Troubleis sad and has one of the best story lines for a song I ever heard. Music wise... One of the best! From there it flows on and on like a never ending dream.  ( NOTE: IF JIM CARRY LISTENS TO THIS STUFF...) -its cool sounding music-
B00020HEL6|5.0|I love this version of Midnight at the Oasis!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|As I sit here and read the comments I think it's ridiculous to give this album a bad review. The album is one the best they put out yet. Yeah, I miss some the heaviness from the frist and second albums. I think they're climbing to a new level of the nu-metal genre and in saying they have more to offer to the table then to be label or stuck into that category of music. I'm totally digging the song Circle off this album. The ended of Circle is so great, it sounds like something that Trent Reznor would do or has done with Nine Inch Nails. I think it sets the bar from their true fans to fake fans again like what they did with there Self-title fans(People who only like them for the song wait and bleed) to there Iowa fans(People that love them for there heaviness). It's one there unique albums they put out yet. Don't let the bad reviewers run you away from this album. They're just poseur! <br />Bad reviewers think they soild out because they did an acoustic song. Acid Bath off their \\"When The Kite String Pops\\" album did an acoustic song called The Bones Off Baby Dolls. The funny thing is that Acid Bath is a Death Metal. They came back with their second album that was more sick and twisted then there frist. If you never heard of Acid Bath I advise you pick up there \\"When The Kite String Pops\\" album. Alice In Chains is another band who did acoustic set. Are those bands \\"SELL-OUTS\\"? I think not!<br />Slipknot's new album has Stone Sour influeunce in it. Well what are you going to get when you hear Corey Taylor start using his true vocals. I mean look back on WAIT AND BLEED and LEFT BEHIND. Are those songs Stone Sour influeunce because he uses some his true voacls there. To you pukes who think and live off hearing the double bass kick is what makes Metal good. Then man you need to learn more about Metal music or music itself. You can't keep producing the same sound over and over again because it gets boring to fans. That is what exactly they did with their Self-Title and Iowaalbums.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you like your science fiction with the realm of the plausible, minus silly looking aliens and unbelievable special effects, this DVD set is for you.  One DVD had me itching to view the rest -- the characters and the stories are irresistible!  The one sour note (emphasis on the words &quot;one&quot; and &quot;note&quot;) is the somewhat-limited talent of Adam Baldwin, as the mercenary, Jayne Cobb.  The rest of the cast, from veteran actor Ron Glass to veritable newcomer Summer Glau are stupendous!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss does it right, FOX execs do it wrong.  Today's trendyness towards Reality TV and the crap that Reality TV spawns makes dollar signs and not sense.<br />This series was by far the most inventive and engaging television series that could've been on air in recent history.  Yet FOX execs pulled it's plug.  They obviously know nothing about quality.<br />We can only be grateful that the movie is greenlit and filming as of well, now - and that we WILL see more of this fantastic concept on the big screen.  Too bad FOX is so shortsighted that cancelled it tho.<br />As a rule, I'm not a TV watcher.  I pay attention to whats on.  Check it out and if it's worth it I allow myself to watch it.<br />Firefly IS fantastic.  And worth way more than the purchase price of the DVD set.
B000003TAR|5.0|Anyone who gives this amazing cd less than 5 stars is an insult. Not just to rock, but to music in general. Kurt Cobain is an amazing guitarist/songwriter that should be given more than the credit that is given to him in some of the other reviews. You can see some of his amazing song writing in songs like &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot;. With lyrics like, &quot;I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black.&quot; And lyrics like, &quot; ...Man eating orchids....&quot; make the songs on this cd more than just your average rock songs. These songs are thought  - provoking masterpieces that require more than just one listen to fully understand.<BR>    Next is the vocals on this cd. By listening to songs such as &quot;Rape Me&quot; you can hear the softness in Kurt's voice, drawing you in like a &quot;magnet tar pit&quot; (as said in &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot;). But by listening to songs like &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; you can hear the buildup of Kurt's voice into an unstable shriek, &quot;STAY AWAY!!!&quot;.<BR>   Overall, this is an amazing cd that should be given more credit. Thank you Saint Cobain.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I listened to the first 2 songs on the Tower Records listening station. They were good enough to make me buy the entire album. <br />You might have heard \\"Take Me Out\\" on the radio. That song is representative of the remainder of the album. Very catchy but not over-produced. <br />The sound of this album reminds me of Duran Duran's first album (only without the synthesizers). It also reminds me of the movie \\"Velvet Goldmine.\\"
B0000019PA|5.0|The most common complaint about this record is Jeff Mangum's harrowing voice. My idol, David Byrne, once said, &quot;The better a singer's voice is, the harder it is to believe what they're saying.&quot; So by the standards of modern pop music, Mangum's voice is god awful. But it's perfect for In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. Mangum's songwriting has a hauntingly beautiful quality. His tortured voiced, much like Ian Curtis', only accentuates the heartbreaking obscurity of his lyrics. <br />Weird and wonderful, this album is a must buy for anyone who isn't uptight about perfect production and singing. The production, by the way, is perfect for this album. But once again, it just isn't for the clean and poppy albums of today. Approach this album with an open mind
0380789019|4.0|Richard Mayhew is a normal guy.  His girlfriend's a bit obsessive, and his career seems to be going nowhere.  But then he meets Door--a young girl he finds on the street, bleeding.  Richard takes Door back to his apartment, where he lets her rest and get better.<br />Before long, a couple &quot;men&quot; come looking for her.  They are Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar--two wisecracking, charming, thoroughly sadist and bloodthirsty individuals.  They promise to tear out Richard's liver and feed it to him...and they mean to keep it.<br />In an effort to protect himself, and to find out why he seems to be disappearing from the normal world, Richard tracks down Door...and finds something he never suspected: London Below, a world BELOW the city of London, where the phrase &quot;Mind the gap&quot; at rail stations means something entirely different...where a beast stalks a huge labyrinth...and a fallen angel plots a dastardly scheme...<br />Neil Gaiman is a thrilling, imaginative author.  &quot;Neverwhere&quot; will hold you rivited to your seat with its action, suspense, and the perils of Richard Mayhew and his naivity.  It's a must for fans of sci-fi, fantasy, and good old adventures.
B000005IS1|5.0|So much has already been said about this record and it's all true.  I just wanted to add that this is, IMHO, one of the greatest live rock recordings in music history.  The sound is amazingly clear, yet the raw, loose energy of the performance is entirely preserved.  Only Hawkwind's 'Space Ritual', Motorhead's 'No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith' and The Who's 'Live at Leeds' are worthy of being mentioned in the same breath.
B00005JM02|5.0|*****5 stars for the film<br />Clown fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) live in the perfect anemone suburbia - and they're about to become proud parents of more than 400 kids. But then tragedy strikes, leaving Marlin a single parent of the lone egg that survives. <br />He names his son Nemo.<br />Given the circumstances, it's easy to understand why Marlin becomes a devoted (if neurotic) dad who is afraid to let his son out of his sight - not to mention a super-worrier about all the dangers of ocean. But when the free spirited Nemo (Alexander Gould) is taken by divers and held hostage in a dentist's aquarium, Marlin will have to swim the ocean to save his son. He is aided by Dory (Ellen DeGeneres in a hilarious performance), a zany blue tang fish who - memorably - happens to have short-term memory loss.<br />Along the way they meet surfer dude turtles, sharks who've taken a pledge not to eat other fish (\\"Fish are friends, NOT food!\\") and a host of other original characters.<br />It's true that the technical wizards at Pixar have captured every nuance of light and water - you feel as though you *are* underwater. And more to the point, you feel like you're swimming through a rainbow. Finding Nemo is among the most brilliantly colorful movies ever made.<br />Finding Nemo doesn't have quite as many clever lines aimed to sail over kids' heads and at adults' as Monster's Inc. or Toy Story. But it does have heart, and it sticks to its story -Marlin as the overprotective parent who doesn't know how to let go; Nemo as the youngster eager to test his wings (that is, fins!) - and it hits all the right notes.<br />The kids will love it, and even adults who've sworn off Disney will be laughing despite themselves. Just make sure the kids know that in real life, all drains don't lead to the ocean (you'll understand when you see the film).<br />This one's a keeper.<br />\\"P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered!\\"<br />*****5 stars for the DVD<br />Picture & sound quality are excellent.<br />2 discs. EXTRAS BONANZA ALERT! Lots of fun games & activities for the kids, a \\"Making Nemo\\" documentary, a Behind-the-Scenes tour of Pixar Animation Studios & lots more. Fullscreen & Widescreen viewing options.<br />Comes in a sturdy DVD snap case with artwork as pictured, inside of a protective slipcase with identical artwork.
B0000027RL|5.0|Alright, first off, I'd like to say that, while Ten is not my all time favorite album, it's right up there. Second, they are not a rip-off of Nirvana, true, both bands ARE from Seattle, and, true, they did come out around the same time, but if the people who say this would in fact listen to Ten, they would see that it and Nevermind are quite different. And third, to the people who say that &quot;most of their fan base are upper-middle class suburban preppy rich KIDS REPUBLICANS&quot;, are a bit wrong there, as I consider myself to be a fan of Pearl Jam and I'm a 14 year old, poor, lower class, non-preppy, Democrat girl. So, while I admit that I do not know what the average PJ fan is like, having never personally met said average person, this is not entirely their audience. Frankly, I most confess that I have no idea where the Republican stuff is coming from lol.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is definitely the Star Wars of Japanese animation. If the Academy of Motion Arts and Sciences had made the Animated category years ago this would have definitely won for 1997. It is probably the most epic animated feature I can think of recently.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|Once again Tony Banks has demonstrated complete brilliance and extraordinary talent in his musical efforts.  Along with guiding the rock group Genesis for well over 3 decades, Banks has proven that his musisical instincts have not diminshed in the last few years sine the rock group has been dormant.<br />Seven is a wonderful musical expression that is both dramatic and inspiring.  One cannot help but think how incredibly appropriate parts of this music would be to accompany film.  Most of all the music, like all of the previous Bank's efforts takes you away on an adventure of beuatiful sounds and melodies.<BR>well done and I strongly encourage all readers to pick-up this CD.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is a psychological thriller, a mind-bending science- fiction work, and a piece of social satire all rolled into one.  Although I would not consider it a horror movie, it can be a tad creepy at times.  When it's not being creepy, it is quite often hilarious.  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a smart movie that deals with a number of different issues (sometimes at the same time) and delves into a number of different movie genres.  I do not recommend this movie to someone who lacks the patience to watch movies more than once.  <br />The acting in the movie is generally pretty good.  The big names (Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle) will attract many of the movie's viewers, but after watching the movie, few will doubt that it's the teens of the cast that really make it special.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I had the luck to find this cd in the bins for $5(US). I was kind of apprehensive about getting it, because I had never heard their music beforehand. When I first listened to it, I was completly blown away. This CD is some of the best ambient music I have ever heard. Whenever I feel angry, sad, or just plain crappy, this CD helps me get through the day.<BR>Highly reccomended.

B0001Z53AQ|5.0|First off let me say that this album was great as i expected.  There a lot of tight tracks but there are some really bad ones too.  <br />Git up- Great intro, the beat could have been a little faster but its an intro so i wasnt expecting much.(3/5)<br />Loyalty- Unbelivable track. Obie Trice outshines everyone.(5/5)<br />Just like U- Decent track. Only Bizzare is featured on it. Catchy. (3/5)<br />Ill be damned- Beat is a little too slow but the chorus is catchy and flows nicely. (3/5)<br />My Band-  You all know this song.  Very catchy and a masterpiece of its own. (5/5)<br />U R the one- no comment (0/5)<br />6 in the morning-  Eminem starts off the track but the rest is just average (2/5)<br />how come- Good ass song.  Eminem provides the hook on this track and he lets the rest finish. nicely done (5/5)<br />Leave dat boy alone- Creepy, Scary, and tight as hell.  This is one of the best tracks on the album (5/5)<br />Get My Gun-  Unbelivable!!!  This is fastest song on the album and has the best flow.  Eminem's verse is something to listen to. (5/5)<br />Bitch-  Nice beat.  This is a great track(...).(4/5)<br />D12 World- Kanye West's laces this track and comes out superb.  The beat is weird but its amazing. (5/5)<br />40 OZ- Quite possibly the best song ever made.  Lil Jon has done it again. (100/5)<br />American Psycho-  2nd best song on the album.  Of course Dr Dre cant produce a bad song.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I thought &quot;Let go&quot; was brilliant but &quot;under my skin&quot; is fantastic. I'm glad that &quot;happy ending&quot; is the next single to be released and i hope that &quot;how does it feel&quot; and &quot;fall to pieces&quot; follow.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|For a slipknot fan to pick this album up and listen to it,is sort of like coming home from a 3 year prison sentence to find out that you kid brother is not the fowled mouth, obnoxious person he was when you last seen him.  Not to knock slipknots past albums, because I own and love both of them, theres just a greater sense of maturity on this album.  Songs like Circle and Vermillion Pt.2 are perfect examples of this.  The most impressing factor of this album is that they've matured without sacraficing their brutality.  If you are a slipknot fan reading this wondering whether or not to buy it, BUY IT, you will love it and it's just another step in the evolution of slipknot as musicians and people.
B000148KK2|5.0|Ok, so based on the other reviews, you have already figured out that she's not doing jazz standards here. If you like your music in nice easy classification compartments so it makes it easier when you alphabatise your CD's, this isn't for you. If you like to mix it up, crossover, break new ground, make some stodgier folks uneasy, Buy it - I liked it.

1592400876|4.0|When one thinks of grammar guides, a few words usually come to mind. Boring. Dull. Not &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation&quot;.  I found Lynne Truss' book to be both educational and entertaining.  She combines humor, history, and practical history to make readers aware of common grammatical errors.  However, readers in the United States should remember that the author is British, so a few of the rules do not apply the same.  For anyone looking for a delightful read to brush up on grammar skills - get this book.  If you're looking for a definitive reference guide, you may want to look else where.
630027120X|5.0|The subject matter of this story, based on real events, is the expussion of the Jesuits from Amrica (1750).  They became the refugy of the indigenous people of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina from hacendados or slavery.  Jesuits' doctrine was one of love; they loved and respected the guaran.  Nevertheless, spanish society still considered indians as \\"jungle animals\\".  Due to the abuse that  landowners committed against the guaran, some of the missionaries felt the moral responsability to report it to religious authorities which did nothing about it.  The missionaries responded each as their consciousness guided them to protect the guaran.  The courage of the missionaries is admirable.  This film is worth watching because it presents a very accurate and descriptive account of a terribly sad part of latinamerican history.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I'll start by saying BUY THIS ALBUM ASAP.<BR>I am shocked that the reviewers of this album who claim to be &quot;fans&quot; say this is not their best work.  I strongly disagree.  This album is my favorite Rage album, and probably one of the last riff-oriented rock albums of the 90's (before nu-metal and 3 chord punk really took over mainstream rock).  I consider this to be the best Rage album and one of the best albums ever created.  Tom Morrello(rage guitarist) is a musical genius, he is a Harvard graduate and his innovation will never be matched. <BR>If you are reading these other reviews, please take mine into consideration, I respect the veiws of my fellow rage fans, but I beg to differ.  So, if you want powerful rock riffs that will blow your mind for years to come, look no further, Battle of LA is that and more. Buy it, I GUARANTEE YOU WILL ENJOY IT, if you don't: send me an email at Thextream400@hotmail.com, and I'll listen to your opinion.<BR>Buy the album and see for yourself- it rocks
0448060191|5.0|My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read. Read this one. Your eyes will thank you later.
B00005UKE0|5.0|there's so much you don't know about George Harrison, after listening to this album everyday when I woke up all the way through each and every morning for seventy seven days, jams and bonus tracks included, there is even more I don't know about George Harrison, God help me this album contains secrets
0446608955|1.0|I am not hard-hearted or lacking in sentiment (I loved &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;), but the only word I can find to accurately describe this book is CLOYING!
B0000C8AVX|5.0|Ok, I'm gonna try and break through the barriers and come out and say it.  If you are a kid and you don't know what is happening to you, and you feel like the world is changing in an uncomfortable way, your body is changing and your mind is changing, maybe you feel rebellious, maybe you feel left out, maybe you think punk rock is the real musical outlet of your feeling, maybe something else. If you see this album laying around your house, your dad's copy, listen to it. If you don't have immediate access to it, get it, listen to this album, so what if it is forty five years old.  It matters.  It matters right now.  If you are older you should get it too, if you don't know about what is happening on this album then you have, in my opinion, missed the big secret.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I love &quot;Underworld&quot;! I saw it in the movie theater when it first came out, then bought the dvd and novelization and just recently purchased the new unrated extended cut dvd.<br />The extended cut has some new added/recut scenes and, although I would've loved for it to be longer, I felt that it did add more dimension to some of the characters. Some of the new scenes include more backstory on Michael Corvin, a love scene between Kraven and Erika and an extended battle at the finale. The scene after Selene's car fell in the river has been recut and there are some minor additions that are barely noticeable (unless you've seen the theatrical cut a few times).<br />The new special features are also a big plus. I enjoyed &quot;Fang vs. Fiction&quot; and the entertaining commentary by director Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, to name a few.<br />I have already posted a longer review on the theatrical cut dvd and it goes without saying that I enjoy this film immensely. It's simply the kind of action film that you could watch over and over again. <br />Kate Beckinsale as Selene is simply mesmerizing. Who would've thought that the young British actress who started out in costume dramas/comedies like the BBC's &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; could successfully transform herself into a credible action heroine.  The rest of the cast is also outstanding and the story is completely engrossing.<br />I would recommend this extended cut dvd to fans of &quot;Underworld&quot; particularly if they already do not have the original theatrical cut.  I can't wait for the sequel to come out......
B00000DOZH|1.0|This isnt AC/DCs greatest albums but all the songs are great. Its rare that someone likes every song off an album by an artist but who cant like all these songs by a great band. I give this album three stars since its not the best rockin AC/DC album. The best IMO is Let there Be Rock since most of the songs have a bigger guitar sound to them thats what rock is about.
B00005B534|5.0|This band blows me away! Everything is there-instrumentation-vocals-excellent songs-WOW. Symphony X is my favorite band but this is like Symphony X with a little more of the orchestral/symphonic influence although the music is very heavy with a darker atmosphere at times. This band really does sound very much like Symphony X-even the vocals-although this is not quite as guitar dominated. If you heard this for the first time, you would think it was Synphony x-it is that good. I do like the more symphonic quality of this bands 2 releases-this is more like V or the Odyssey although the songwriting is not as original as X. This is the direction I wish X would stay in-i love this bands 2 releases.
0778320448|4.0|When she opens a yarn and knitting shop on Blossom Street, cancer survivor Lydia Hoffman doesn't know what to expect. She has enough money to run the shop for a while, but will she bring in customers? Or is she simply wasting her time and creating a burden on her mother, as her sister hints? It doesn't take too long before Lydia's beginning knitting class starts up with three very different women. Jacqueline Donovan is a wealthy snob, contemptuous of her daughter-in-law and angry with her husband for having an affair. Alix Townsend is planning on working off the community service time she earned for having drugs in her purse (they belonged to her roommate). Carol Girard is obsessed with having a baby--no matter what the financial, emotional, or ethical costs. Despite their differences and initial conflict, the four women forge a bond, gradually growing together.<br />At first, the women seem to share only two things--their knitting and an unhealthy self-obsession. By working together, each becomes free to break out from their self-imposed boundaries and to see how their self-destructive behavior was a choice rather than something imposed on them from the outside.<br />Author Debbie Macomber specializes in strongly written stories of women coming together for support and growth. THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET is a strong entry into this category. Although all four women may initially put readers off, their growing strength as they finally face their problems and seize their power makes them sympathetic and even heroic. The love interests are possibly a bit too perfect, but this is a romance after all and who needs a romantic fantasy about a realistic male.
6303481272|3.0|I don't want to piss the NS fans out there but I don't see how good this is?  I mean I have to agree with one reviewer, this is one of the coolest animes but I didn't think it was a masterpiece.  <BR>The story was alright but not big!<BR>The animation was great but not excellent.<BR>The action was great.  <BR>Over all it was an alright Ninja flick.  Though I think this film is a little overhyped.<br />Also I have a problem of people saying &quot;OH THERES A RAPE SCENE!  OH! <BR>Gimmi a freaking break its not like you see what going on!  Even though you have the sence of whats going on it's still stupid how people make a big deal that you see like a 2 minute rape scene which you barley see anything but a nipple shot.  Jeez.<br />Now I must say the violence is over the top.  Especially when one guy gets both his arms ripped right off. EEWWWW thats gotta hurt.<br />Over all I thought this was an alright flick I guess.<BR>Check it out for yourself and give your opinion on it.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Easy to nav, awesome picture &amp; sound.  The home movies are an addition, not a distraction.  This accurately shows the greatness of AIC.
B00006BTCA|4.0|This album is very, very  dark and very, very nice and wonderful and intoxicating and mortifyingly handsome in ways beyond my power to describe this album. It took me forever just to buy it because everyone else seems to love it and I never like what everyone else likes but I bought it never the less and this band is very cool even though they just want too be a fake ass of a fake ass post punk machine which they are and are not. And are.   End transmission.
6305603847|5.0|This is an awesome DVD.  Don't expect a storyline, and don't try to make sense of it.  It's all about the music!
B000001EYW|5.0|Please, cut the Brother's Gibb a break, they have taken enough criticism over the years, give it a rest.  Still Waters is a very good CD.  It's refreshing to see that a group can change it's style of music.  What they did 30 years ago was fine, but as we grow in our craft we get better, we get smooth, our taste becomes refined and Still Waters is a very refined CD.  I love it's soft sometimes jazzy tunes, makes it great for relaxing and just chilling with that someone special.  Great job guys!
B0000DJZB9|4.0|It's awesome for a 98 DVD but I'd like to see a revised edition w/ surround mix
B000001EYW|4.0|Still Waters was very different from most of their earilier recordings, which shows how an artist(s) can grow and change as it's audience changes.  I particularly love I will, My Lover's prayer, and I Surrender.  This CD has a smooth, mellow flow which I find refreshing.  It just goes to show how great people and how smooth an artist can get as perfection goes on.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is an awesome compilation of classic Zeppelin tunes.  It is a MUST HAVE for all rock &amp; blues fans.  The mixing is perfect, and the only problem is in Immigrant Song (It's 2 seperate performances on audio &amp; video, merged), but it just looks like a music video as opposed to a live performance.  GET IT NOW
B000000OQF|4.0|This has got to be the best Guns N' Roses album ever made. With classics like &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot;, &quot;Nightrain&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; How could you go wrong?? Not to mention &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; has got to have one of the best riffs ever.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|im not a fan or newer metal like korn or disturbed. it sucks. this is actually good though. they have realized their sound. good guitar, vocals, a little slower than their older stuff i guess though. I liked it, and im an old school thrasher (kreator,exodus,metallica,testament,etc.) and the farthest i go into death metal is death. Excellent record though. almost pure hardcore except for some acoustic sh*t.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Nancy Meyers's spirited scripting and direction keeps the action spinning as veteran film stars Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton team up in \\"Something's Gotta Give,\\" a lively romp through the world of a very lively and wealthy record executive whose life takes an abrupt turn.<br />(...)When he accompanies beautiful Amanda Peet to her playwright mother's luxurious Hamptons home he quickly gets much more than anticipated.  Thoughts of a carefree sex romp with Peet vanish when mother Diane Keaton turns out to be home, along with her sister, played by Frances McDormand.  Convinced he is intruder, they are ready to call the police until he provides a quick explanation.<br />Keaton decides to let Nicholson stay with Peet, but new complications emerge when he sustains a heart attack from the effects of Viagra.  The doctor who treats him, Keanu Reeves, prescribes rest for Nicholson.  If he will not stay in the hospital, the only feasible nearby alternative is Keaton's home.<br />A fresh complication emerges as Reeves reveals himself as a big fan of playwright Keaton and falls for her.  While Nicholson initially admits that he has a yen only for women young enough to be at least his daughter, the more he sees of the resourceful, independent Keaton, the better he likes her.<br />The romantic complications are resolved in, appropriately enough, that city of eternal romance, Paris.  Nicholson, Keaton and Reeves emerge all the wiser from the romantic whirl spin, and alas, nobody has so much as a disparaging word for anyone else when everything is resolved.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Incredible movie, but not one to watch just anytime.  Very disappointed that there don't seem to be any special features.  This cries out for TONS of extras!  How about a director's commentary?  Mel supplied the whole $25 million budget out his own pocket, so there must be really interesting behind-the-scenes discussion.  And how about documentaries on the accuracy and controversy surrounding the launch of the movie.  It just deserves this treatment.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First of all I would like to say that this CD is spectacular.  It is a wonderful mixture of great sound of the previous Slipknot and newly found emotion of now.  <br />Just because Slipknot's sound has been built upon does not mean that they are sell-outs.  The so-called &quot;new&quot; sound has been added because it is what SLIPKNOT themselves wanted to do.  They did not include an acoustic guitar and more melodic singing because it was the cool thing to do.  They did it because THEY FELT like it.<br />  This album is still as dark and as heavy as before, but has added a touch of clarity.  This CD is one of best CD's I have ever heard.  Every song is played accurately and exhilirating.  Joey's Drums are indescribable, the guitars are riviting, Corey's voice is hypnotic yet aggressive, and the rest of the instruments are used in a perfect way.<br />  I listen to this Cd for at least 3 hours everyday since its release and I never get tired of it.  Every song on this CD is great.  Among my favorites are Opium of the People, Vermilion, Before I Forget, and The Nameless.  Opium of the People has intriguing guitar parts and perfectly entwined screaming and singing.  Vermilion is an eerie sounding song with powerful riffs and verses.  Before I Forget has wonderful instrumentals and uses my Idol(Corey Taylor)'s voice to declare, &quot;I am a world before I am a man, I was a creature before I could stand&quot;. (Magnificent Song)  The Nameless is incredible because it has fast Slipknot which transistions quickly into a singing acapala(sp?).  This song is probably my favorite.<BR>All of the songs on this Cd are good in different ways, but they ARE all great.  I recommend this CD to everyone because it has a little melodousy, a little screaming, a little Acoustic, a little fast, a little slow, a little eerie, BUT ALL SLIPKNOT!<br />Anyone who thinks otherwise is just too strict with setting their ways.  Get over what you may think is a stupid aspect of this CD(like the soft-esque style in some songs).  It is what they, the artists, chose to do because of themselves.  If you are a true fan of Slipknot like me, you will LOVE this CD.  Go out and buy it right now.<br />P.S.  I even like some of the songs on Slipknot's very first CD called &quot;Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat&quot; (before Corey Taylor)so I have known Slipknot for a long while. So do not LIBERATE, MY MADNESS.<br />What are you waiting for, Go Get Vol 3: (The Subliminal Verses) right f*ing now!
B000002GVO|5.0|This is a great CD!  It will always be a H-O-T CD due to the song &quot;Hotel California&quot;. This is just a great song!!  This album was released in the mid 70's and has remained one of their classics since that time.  Everyone knows the song &quot;Hotel California&quot;, right!!? If you were to buy this CD for that song alone it is worth it!  The rest of the CD is worth listening to also.  I am a big Eagles fan so I enjoy any Eagles music, period!  Anyone buying this CD won't reget it!!!<br />I have the Eagles CD &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; and the version of the song &quot;Hotel California&quot; on this CD is not even close to the album I am reviewing now.  The song is done live on &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; and it does not have the original quality sound.  I would recommend this CD over the &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; CD.  Just a tidbit if you are looking for the original &quot;Hotel California&quot; song.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Just finished viewing this delightful movie with my husband, 15 year old son and 13 year old daughter.  Of course, it gets a little \\"sappy\\" at times but there are definitely worse ways to spend a few hours of family time.  The film copy was gorgeous.  We especially enjoyed the interior design of the older home.  A favorite was the opening scene with the family gathered in the  kitchen critiqueing the homemade batch of catsup. The music was neither too much, nor too little and kept the story moving at a comfortable pace.  We highly recommend this gem of a film.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I read a lot of reviews on this album deciding whether or not to get it...I really didn't want to spend my $ on a sell-out weak album. But after finnally breaking and getting the album I can say that their truly are a lot of stupid people out there.<br />This album is outstanding. It's just a lot more diverse and mature. It still f-ing rocks and the slower songs are great as well. And this is coming from someone who likes it as heavy as it gets, but I also know good music when I hear it. I don't think it's quite as ground-breaking/good as self-titled(in my opinion that album alone brought back the &quot;resurgence&quot; of American metal) but it runs circles around IOWA. A great buy that is well-worth the money.
B00002SSRZ|3.0|In my humble opinion, this is the finest album by Santana.  The music is an absolutely fabulous fusion of latin/caribbean rythms and rock.  And no one can get into the meaning of a note the way Carlos Santana can.  I have owned this album on vinyl, CD, SACD, and now on DTS.  The music is 5 star, and this is truly an essential album in any collection.    However, THE POWERS THAT BE in the music industry really blew it both when they converted the album to SACD and to DTS.  To my ears, when THE POWERS produced the SACD, rather than go back to the original analog master tapes, they went back to a 24 bit/44.1k digital master used to make the CD.  On my near audiophile system, I hear no discernable difference between the CD and the SACD.  No matter how good the SACD format sounds, it cannot sound better than the source material.  Garbage in, garbage out!    With the DTS version, THE POWERS THAT BE made a different mistake.  On the positive side, some of what is on the DTS version is absolutely amazing.  Notes and instruments and some vocals which were edited out of the original album show up, making a different experience and take on the music.  However, it appears they forgot to mix in the bass.  What is there sounds like blead over of the bass picked up on different microphones, or the engineer/producer or someone really didn't know the sound of the original album when they mixed this version.  Santana's work is very dense, with tons of percussion and Santana's incredible guitar work.  The bass anchored and gave the rest of the music a primal feel.  Its absence on the DTS is really missed, and leaves the music feeling incomplete.    So, I give this version of Abraxas 3 stars for the mistakes.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The second installment to the matrix proves that there was never meant to be a second installment, The first movie finished quite properly and pretty much left enough room for a sequel but this isn't it, this just ruins the first movies aspects and is a shameless showcase of &quot;cutting-edge&quot; movie graphic technology. The philosophies, that some claim make this movie incredible, are the most useless, and cryptic ideas ever....the whole point of this movie is to trick you into believing you have seen some miracle of modern cinema but really it is nothing more than a pseudo-intelletual attempt science-fiction.
B00005JMEW|5.0|First, if you've watched previous Tarantino films and disliked them, skip Kill Bill - both volumes.  It is pure QT from start to finish.  Same, if you don't like Uma Thurman (I am shocked there are some who do not!), you might want to skip as well.  However, if you like QT's quirky humor and oddball films, then you will love Kill Bill - Part 1 mind you!  This is truly the first half of the Kill Bill set.  So, expect the blunt ending that leaves you hanging.  It starts with the old Drive-in lead clip giving you a hint this movie is gash for the B-film addict's soul.  With soundtracks from everywhere and bits and pieces stolen - homage? - to other films, then remade in QT magic, it's a film buff's trivia delight.<br />In TQ style, you are given puzzle pieces that eventually fit together to present the whole story.  Thurman - rather preggers and on her wedding day - is attacked by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  The whole wedding party is taken out in a<br />bloodbath, with the unseen Bill putting a bullet to Thurman's head at the end of it.  When the police arrive, they find Thurman not dead and rush her to hospital, where she stays in coma for over four years.  Once she awakens, she finds it kill or be killed.  So, she set out on her adventure to kill the five people on her list - Bill being the last.<br />Everyone was Kung-Fu dancing, with tongue-through-cheek, in some of the wildest ninja fight scenes.  QT's brilliant, quirky wit shines in that totally indefinable way of his.  But it's Thurman who is the WOW of this show.  She alternates between her homely - breathtaking beauty, as the scene calls for it, and makes the total absurdity believable.<br />If you like QT, you will love Kill Bill Vol 1.  If you have not liked him, then forgetaboutit...you will hate it.
0312263120|4.0|After reading Dan Brown's Angels and Demons, I was anxious to read Digital Fortress.  This book certainly provides the reader with a wild ride!  While I liked the history in Angels and Demons, I thought the plot was less hokey in Digital Fortress.  It also provides a fascinating look inside the National Security Agency.  The NSA is more secretive than the CIA and FBI.  The NSA is responsible for gathering global electronic intelligence data, which can come from within our own country, other countries, or even from groups (such as terrorist organizations).  Much of the communication that the NSA monitors is encrypted, and Digital Fortress gives us a peak at the job of a cryptographer, or code breaker.<br />We are introduced to NSA head cryptographer and her boss, Susan Fletcher and Trevor Strathmore.  Their job is made much easier by the use of a top-secret, billion dollar computer called TRANSLTR.  But there is always the threat of a code that can't be broken, and when TRANSLTR takes more than 15 hours and still can't crack a code (most codes take less than an hour), the possibility of such a dangerous situation becomes a reality.  This code came from a disgruntled ex-NSA cryptographer, and he seems to be holding the NSA hostage.  There is murder, mystery, and mayhem and I had little clue who the villain was until the very end.<br />Through it all, Brown also presents the debate on how much the government should be allowed to know vs. the freedoms of our citizens. Should the NSA be able to snoop our e-mail and phone conversations at will?  It's a tough balancing act.<br />So, if you're looking for great literature, this isn't it.  But if you want a book that is suspenseful, fast-paced and thoroughly entertaining, Dan Brown is your man.

This book tells all from the crues child hoods all the way to Vince &quot;leaving/being fired&quot; and everything after and in between. As others say this is not for the faint of heart but a definite must have for any Crue fan. You will learn things you never new and maybe never really wanted to know but just don't care because it is the real Crue.

0790734060|5.0|&quot;Amadeus&quot; dares to tell the story of mediocrity, and in the words of the mediocre some astounding truths are told.  <br />Essentially narrated by the aged and suicidal Salieri in a &quot;confession&quot; to a young priest in the &quot;present day&quot; (actually 1823), former musical giant (composer of the &quot;greatest opera yet written&quot; that has been consigned to the ashbin of history) and now a wrinkled has-been, &quot;Amadeus&quot; ponders the plight of an ambitious man (Salieri) confronted by genius that he can never defeat on its own terms.  According to &quot;Amadeus,&quot; the results of this clash are not pretty. <br />The film opens spectacularly, with Salieri screaming &quot;Mozart&quot; against a black screen.  Soon we see Salieri, blood gushing from his self-slashed throat, being whisked through the streets of Vienna as the city dances and whirls to Mozart's exhilirating Symphony No. 25 in G Minor (don't worry -- you'll recognize it).  With an amazing economy, the film, directed by Milos Forman (and adapted  Paul Shaffer from his own stage work) establishes a world of wondrous palaces, hyper-elaborate dress, and astounding music.  No mere costume drama, &quot;Amadeus&quot; drops the viewer deep into the late 18th century in Vienna, then one of the most powerful cities in Europe and a cultural touchstone for the Western world.  This is the city to which all composers flock.<br />Salieri, with his crabbed hands and scratchy voice, tells of his early years, when he promises his soul to God in return for the ability to make music to honor God. He pledges his industry, his chastity, and his eternal devotion.  And, wonder of wonders, his dad (a merchant with no ear for music) dies, choking to death at lunch!  So Salieri is free to pursue his love of music, and it appears that God has granted Salieri his wish -- Salieri rises to become Court Composer for Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). <br />Well regarded, Salieri has his world turned upsidedown by the arrival of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, in an inspired casting coup).  Vulgar, impulsive, hedonistic, and supremely talented, Mozart's reputation as a genius has preceded him, but Salieri is horrified to see that Mozart is (almost) as concerned with debauchery as his music.  Even more horrifying, Salieri realizes that Mozart is more talented than he -- reading over Mozart's pages, Salieri groans, &quot;It was like he was taking dictation from God.&quot;<br />Why, God, why?  Salieri cannot fathom why God would make this creature the vehicle for such talent . . . talent that only Salieri seems to appreciate.  Mozart is popular with the masses, but cannot make a big splash with the Court . . . in part because the Emperor, who defines taste for the Court, has no ear for music.  When the Emperor yawns during one of Mozart's performances, Mozart is doomed.  The Emperor also has some priceless advice for Mozart -- don't use so many notes, becuase the human ear can only hear so many notes before it gets tired!  <br />Driven to despair by the continued genius flowing from Mozart's pen, Salieri rejects God and vows to destroy God's creature.  What follows is a descent into madness for both Salieri and Mozart.  Without getting overly sentimental, Forman and Shaffer spin a tale of surpassing beauty (Mozart's music) and tragedy (Mozart's death).  <br />Ultimately, Salieri proclaims that he is the champion of mediocrity everywhere.  As he is whisked away from the shell-shocked priest, Salieri absolves the various patients in his insane asylum, he also absolves the audience (who cannot help but feel mediocre in the face of Mozart's genius?).  In a pitch-perfect note, as the screen dissolves to final black, we again hear Mozart's aggravating, infuriating high-pitched giggle, and we know that it will forever haunt Salieri.<br />&quot;Amadeus&quot; throws us into the mania of composition for both Mozart and Salieri, the world of court intrigues, and the triumphs and agonies of success and failure for composers.  We understand Salieri's torture as his music grows fainter as Mozart's popularity soars -- even after Mozart's death.  This is a powerful film with a surprisingly dark theme, but it is required viewing for any fan of classical music.  <br />The soundtrack, by Sir Neville Mariner of the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, is astounding, and will have you rushing out to buy Mozart CDs as soon as the movie is over.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I saw this post below...&quot;did I never saw Joey Ramone, Kurt Cobain, or Matt Skiba on the cover of Teen People?&quot;  Wow, with intelligence like that I'll be sure respect your opinion.  Skiba has been in tons of magazines (including Rolling Stone, which doesn't cover trends, it creates them).  So keep on shopping Hot Topic and listening to Alkaline Trio (who has also turned pop) and thinking it makes you hardcore.  This album is quite a step up from her last album, which was a bit too commercial in my opinion.  Worth a listen, at least.
0618526412|1.0|I was excited to finally join \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" and start by reading this book. As I read along and got encouraging emails from Oprah, I kept wondering when the long, cumbersome details of each character would end and some sort of interesting plot would develop.  When I read the end of p. 359 the boring descriptions finally ended.  Unfortunately, it was the last page of the book!!!<br />I did get the point of the book, that we are all more the same than we realize or want to acknowledge....BUT...Overall, I felt that this storyline moved very slow and wasn't very interesting.<br />I'm hoping that the next book club selection is better than this one.
B0001EBXBK|5.0|First, if you've watched previous Tarantino films and disliked them, skip Kill Bill - both volumes.  It is pure QT from start to finish.  Same, if you don't like Uma Thurman (I am shocked there are some who do not!), you might want to skip as well.  However, if you like QT's quirky humour and oddball films, then you will love Kill Bill - Part 1 mind you!  This is truly the first half of the Kill Bill set.  So, expect the blunt ending that leaves you hanging.  It starts with the old Drive-in lead clip giving you a hint this movie is gash for the B-film addict's soul.  With soundtracks from everywhere and bits and pieces stolen - homage? - to other films, then remade in QT magic, it's a film buff's trivia delight.<br />In TQ style, you are given puzzle pieces that eventually fit together to present the whole story.  Thurman - rather preggers and on her wedding day - is attacked by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  The whole wedding party is taken out in a<br />bloodbath, with the unseen Bill putting a bullet to Thurman's head at the end of it.  When the police arrive, they find Thurman not dead and rush her to hospital, where she stays in coma for over four years.  Once she awakens, she finds it kill or be killed.  So, she set out on her adventure to kill the five people on her list - Bill being the last.<br />Everyone was Kung-Fu dancing, with tongue-through-cheek, in some of the wildest ninja fight scenes.  QT's brilliant, quirky wit shines in that totally indefinable way of his.  But it's Thurman who is the WOW of this show.  She alternates between her homely - breathtaking beauty, as the scene calls for it, and makes the total absurdity believable.<br />If you like QT, you will love Kill Bill Vol 1.  If you have not liked him, then forgetaboutit...you will hate it.

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of my fave bands.<BR>I just love ALL kinds of gothic music.<BR>They're great! If you liked this album, you'll like their older ones too...Their older album Origin has many LOVELY Evanescence songs.<br />I recommend these bands for Evanescence fans:<BR>Nightwish, Linkin Park, H.I.M
055357342X|3.0|The first 2 books I loved and read them almost nonstop. However in this the 3rd book some of the things are getting old. Dany is boring, Cat is getting boring same things over and over. However I think the book was good and I would not stop to recommend it to anyone. <br />One of the biggest problems with the book is that I want some &quot;good guys&quot; to have a little better outcome. I do not know how to explain it really it is just reality of the world of the 7 Kingdoms seems way to much &quot;Earth reality&quot;... I do not know it is like the Starks started out as the center point and they would bring about a heroic and masterful success in the realm. We had good guys and bad guys and guys in the middle. I like Tyrion very much and have a strange respect with the Kingslayer. <br />However my favorites keep getting stamped out and the others that are very interesting are not getting enough time. Jon for instance, Jon and his adventures and misadventures could be a standalone book without any of the rest. <br />I know this is a hard review to read it is hard to explain how I feel about the book. It is for sure that you must read it there is no doubting that. I just sometimes feel depressed after reading parts of it! <br />There is not White and Black in this series only shades and shadows of good and evil which is spread a little thicker here and there and neutral with other characters. Too much like the real world?  <br />3 or 4 stars I will go for 3 just because I am not having a good time reading anymore. Is like reading about history in this world and I read fantasy to get away from here. Even so Martin is one of the finest if not the finest storytellers I have read. I just wish for little less depression and mental let down once I connect with a character. Sometimes I just expect Jon to fall off the wall or get stepped on by a Mammoth... yes I want a hero that lives long enough to do something.
B0000024JN|5.0|The Beastie Boys exploded on the scene when I was a teenager in 1986. I bought the Licensed To Ill cassette tape back then when it first came out. (Wish I still had it!!) Now, I have the cd and will have it forever. What a great bunch of fun, extremely catchy and classic rap music for ALL generations. I read in a previous review that the Beastie Boys will be listened to as much as the Beatles, and I almost agree. It's a masterpiece and feel lucky to remember when it was brand new in '86 and cool to blast on the car stereo in the high school parking lot! Buy it today, and you can STILL blast it in the high school parking lot --If you're a teenager, that is, and not an &quot;old fart&quot; like me who's part of the first rap generation affectionately called &quot;Old School&quot; :(
0811826848|5.0|This book purports to tell the Beatles's story in their own words (though augmented by memories from people close to them like Brian Epstein, producer George Martin, roadies Neil Aspinall and Mal Evans, and publicist Derek Taylor), and does the job quite well.<br />I would estimate that at least 80% of the information contained in this book is already old hat for die-hard Beatlemaniacs who have memorized Mark Lewisohn's &quot;Complete Beatles Chronicle&quot; and read every Beatle book out there.  But it's not so much the substance of the information as the way in which it is told--it's great to be able read about these events from the Beatles' point of view, even as seen through the prism of the thirty to forty years that have passed.  And I am grateful that George was able to participate in the whole Anthology project before his untimely death in 2001.<br />The modern-day comments from Paul, George, and Ringo were apparently taken from the interviews from the Beatles Anthology circa 94-95 (if you watch the entire video/DVD and compare it to the text in the book it's pretty obvious).  Hard-core fans will be able to recognize where many of the other quotes came from, although they aren't sourced, unfortunately--after each such quote there's merely a superscript such as &quot;64&quot; or &quot;70&quot; showing the year it was said, with no reference to the publication or interview it was taken from.  That said, the editors had an incredible job piecing this thing together; they could almost be listed as co-writers!<br />There's a great deal of eye-candy (photographs, memos, handwritten notes, drawings, etc.), which are fascinating to look at.  Sometimes, though, the arrangement of text, typeface, and photographs on the page seems rather random and thrown together, and even can make it difficult to read (for example, page 177, which tells about George and John's first LSD trip is printed on a background of garish red with magenta and orange text that all but obliterates the actual text).  But it's never dull.<br />Despite the fact that it may be a bit of a chore to read, since it's large and heavy (even in paperback), it is a joy to read and  I heartily recommend it to all Beatle fans.
B00004ZD69|5.0|This album isn't for everyone. But those of you willing to dedicate your ears and your mind to the aural poetry Godspeed creates will not be disappointed.<br />Lift your Skinny Fists is arguably Godspeed's best album; two discs containing only four songs, each 20 minutes long. The pictures they paint range from post-nuclear holocaust burned cities rife with suffering to meeting god.<br />If you've never heard Godspeed before, this is a great place to start.
1400032717|4.0|Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone can name all the prime numbers up to 2000, can tell there are 60 circles on his teacher's shoes, can figure out it takes exactly 21 minutes to take the bus to school. Christopher has an inquisitive mind, keenness to numbers, unusual intuition of space, but he doesn't like anything yellow or brown. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, a condition similar to autism. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, unlike any book of fiction that I have read, deftly, but in very simplistic language that belongs to the voice of an autistic child, maps out Christopher's mind and emotions.<br />When Christopher discovers that his neighbor's dog Wellington has been murdered with a garden fork, he skillfully applies his logical mind to probe the murder. Starting with neighbors on the same street, Christopher makes his inquiries but to no avail. His teacher Sihoban encourages him to keep all the clues that he has produced and discovered in a book which will eventually manifests into a book. When his father interferes at his investigation and locks up his journal, Christopher sets off a chain of events that unveil a shocking truth about his family. <br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is after all a book about trust, integrity and reconciliation. It verbalizes the mind of an autistic child and internalizes his thinking, bringing his fear and insecurity to full actuality. The book shows great insight to the meticulously, pristinely set of routines that is built on logic and mathematical equations that governs the protagonist's life. The writing is compulsively simple and unadorned.<br />2004 (36) © MY

B00003CXA2|5.0|When I say greatest of all-time that is my opinion of course, but there are many others who would agree with that statement. For those who dont think it is the greatest it has to rank in the top 10 right? Well to me this is a pure cinematic masterpiece in every aspect, from the great cast(Hanks, Fields, Wright, Sinise), the great storyline, the camera work and great directing from Robert Zimeckis. There are also so many memorable quotes in this movie that today, 10 years later I still remember and quote lines from it like &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates...&quot;<br />Forrest Gump is the story of a man that is not very bright but still he sees the world in a way few others ever have or will. We see the progression from the young Forrest who barely makes it into a normal school and is constantly bullied by his peers, to the man who had come to experience so much in life like being on a national champion football team, meeting the president, serving in Vietnam and starting his own shrimping business. Along the way he meets some interesting characters such as Jenny whom he loves his whole life but she follows the wrong path in life, and his best friend Bubba. Bubba was his best friend in the world, and they planned on a partnership in the shrimping business since Bubba's family had always been in that business. You see real emotions that life brings when Bubba dies in Vietnam, when his mother and Jenny die, and when he learns he has a son, Forrest Jr. Forrest lives life to the fullest and I think it is a great message because someone may be considered to be slow but that doesnt mean they can't accomplish so many things in life. <br />The dvd is great and truly does this movie right. The extras are very good like the commentaries and deleted scenes, but to be honest I have not watched all that disc 2 has to offer. I could have gone into more detail about the plot but most of you reading this know what it is about. And if you have never seen it, I really think youwill be amazed at what a great film this is. This is a great price for those who don't own this yet so do yourself a favor and pick this up if you havent already. It is truly the best movie I have ever seen and I can't imagine anything else like it ever happening in cinema. It is my favorite and I doubt anything will ever take its place.
B0001L3LUE|1.0|Robert McNamara's lessons are largely inapplicable to average people, unless the lesson is to be complacent, even in the face of genocidal war. After all, &quot;you can't change human nature (one of the 'lessons').&quot; Many of them, beyond being inapplicable, are incoherent. This film gives no significant insight into the Viet Nam era that you couldn't find elsewhere. Furthermore, McNamara's assumptions that America still, in 2004, accepts the official lies of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, insults our collective intelligence. For example, we know now that Kennedy was fully aware of the coup that ousted Ngo Dinh Diem before it happened, and supported it. We also know that the U.S. was in North Vietnamese territorial waters (not international waters) when the Gulf of Tonkin incident took place. <br />Only when we accept the moral bankruptcy of the Viet Nam War and hold those responsible accountable (in a historical context at least) will we be rid of the &quot;Viet Nam Sydrome&quot; that polarizes Americans decades later. Apologists for genocide may impress the academy, but I personally don't have much use for it. <br />If you want the good Viet Nam documentary of the year, buy the Weather Underground. It should have easily beat this film at the Oscars. I knew when the competition was between an establishment perspective and a radical perspective, the establishment would win, but a bomb in an empty building is much less criminal than millions of tons of bombs on peasant agrarian nations.
B0002234LS|5.0|I saw this movie when it was at the theater and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  The storyline is so... original.  And the small details of the movie are completely sinister, as everything by Stephen King is.  I would go into some comments of the plot, but I don't want to give it away to anyone!<br />I say, if you're one of those people that think \\"Oh, that movie looks stupid,\\" you need to watch it.  Because your opinion will change fast.  Take my word for it, you wont be disappointed.
B00005ABX0|5.0|First off:<br />Smiley Smile is mostly scraps from the aborted Smile sessions and re-recorded in place of some Smile pieces (ex. Vegetables).<BR>Even if Smile didn't exist, this album would be mostly silly bits.  Although there are some hints of brillancy such as the hit single Good Vibrations and the follow-up, Heroes &amp; Villans.  Other standout tracks are Vegetables, Getting Hungry, and Wonderful.<br />Wild Honey on the other hand is the most underrated Beach Boys album.  I just love the slightly mellow feel to it with songs like Country Air and Let The Wind Blow.  Plus some nice airy songs like Darlin', Wild Honey and Here Comes The Night.  The album ends with a Smile outtake chorus taken from Vegetables - titled on this album Mama Says -- (AKA Eat Alot, Sleep Alot, Brush them like crazy....etc)<br />All in all :<br />SS a B<BR>WH gets an A+ IMO.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes exploded onto the scene caked in hype in 2001 with 'Is This It?, and in my opinion lived up to it with fast paced, simple, rythmic, emotional rock.  But here they take it not so much to a new level, but expand on their debut.  The base is still the same, simple basslines and drumlines, but the lyrics and melodies have become more complex.  The guitars use different filters that seem to be borrowed out of the 80s, and the best part is, it works.  'Room On Fire' is one of the best albums is the last couple of years.  'The End Has No End' is my favorite track because its probably one of the looser tracks on the album.  But to gain a full appreciation of The Strokes, see them live.  I saw them at The Norva on the Megadonis Tour, I was awe-struck.  Julian Climbed onto the balcony during 'I Can't Win' (I think thats the right song) and nearly busted his ass a couple times.  Amazing show and an amazing band
0449227421|4.0|The Third Twin was a sort of wierd title for this book i thought. Wouldnt three identical people be triplets and not twins? Anyway, the main character is Dr. Ferrami and she is studying nature vs. nurture and how even if twins are seperated at birth they still end up acting, looking, and dressing alike. She finally meets the perfect subject with a twin that is a convicted rapist.<br />  The story uncovers truth about three power hungry individuals and she has the power to stop one of them from getting into power. This book captures you with its story plot and vivid descriptions of their life. The plot takes a twist and keeps you in suspense.<br />  What i liked about this book was the vivid descriptions and the plot twists. This really kept me hooked and made me turn the pages to find out what would happen next. I had totally different views of some of the characters because of the good descriptions of them.<br />  I really hope everyone that reads this book will enjoy it as much as i did.
B000002UDB|5.0|I first became aware of this Album when my Sister bought this when it first came out in the Fall of 1967 , I was aware of the Beatles but I was only Eight years old but  for some reason this album made  me a Big fan of theres maybe because it was so different than anything else out there at the time songs like Blue Jay Way and Flying ,so Eriee Sounding !!! Actually released in Britian as an Ep Capitol Records refused to Release as An Ep because they didnt sell as well in America so they Released it as an Album adding the previous Singles Hello Goodbye , Strawberry Fields , Penny Lane , Baby Your a Richman and All You Need is Love !!! Just listen to the Genius of this album with starting out with the Title Song Magical Mystery Tour , the drug influenced song I am the Walrus ,Strawberry Fields  Forever  featuring  the Mellotron ,Georges synthesied voice in Blue Jay Way backed up by the Cello  and the  Cut up Tape Loops at the End of Flying ( Would this been thought of  or could be done  if the album was done  Today with all the Advance Technology that goes into Recording  Now a Days )  So Sit Back and enjoy the trip
6305949980|5.0|Ah, what a great film!  The animation is INCREDIBLE...I can only imagine how long it took to make such an amazing stop-motion movie.  Even if the story isn't your thing, you should see at least some of it to see the animation.<br />I thought this was an awesome movie...when I first saw it I was ten and I didn't like it much, but it's definitely grown on me as I got older!<br />As for kids, some will love it to death and watch it over and over...and over.  And for others it might just be a little too macabre.<br />I watch this every Halloween!  The songs are great, the good charachters make mistakes, the design is quirky.  If you like other Tim Burton stuff, you'll probably love The Nightmare Before Christmas!
B00005JLEX|5.0|Jerry made the announcement at his standup in Baltimore about 2 months ago, setting the release for sometime in November. Apparently I have a lot of money to spend that month (along with Halo 2). But anyways, back to Seinfeld. I don't care if the season 1 is going to be $50, $100, maybe even $200. It is definately going to be worth every penny. He is genius. Every actor is perfect for their roles. Loved every episode, and even the repeats that are shown all the time, always have the same level of hilarity (probably not even a word) as the last time I saw it. This, I CAN'T wait for. I'm tired of the bootlegged VCDs and Laserdiscs on a certain auction site. It's time for the real deal. PREORDER YOUR COPY ASAP! You KNOW it's going to sell out.
B00000AFFI|5.0|This album made me a real pj fan.  i had 'rid of me' in my collection but this cd changed everything.  every song is beautiful, different, emotional, and haunting.    my favorites include 'my beautiful leah', ' a perfect day elise', 'angelene', and 'is this desire?'.  'the wind' is extremely haunting to me, in a good way.  i could listen to this album over and over again, and i have and will continue to!
B00008OWZC|5.0|First, I must respond to some of the severe criticisms made by Infidel and Alex Cox.  Just take a look at some of their other album reviews and you will see that they have given five stars to bands/musicians such as duran duran, madonna, U2, and the Cocteau Twins(????), so we don't really need to take any they have to say about music seriously.  Duran Duran, have you ever actually listened to Hungry Like a Wolf, its a terrible song.  Madonna is just a whore.  Who the hell knows who the Cocteau Twinds are and Alex Cox actually had the audacity to talk about Zeppelin being pompous after writing a gloating review of War by U2.  First of all, War is the most pompous titles ever for an album.  Second, Bono is the epitomy of a pompous rockstar who thinks that he and his music are far more important than they could ever possibly be.  So before you go attcking great music, attack yourself for having terrible taste in music.  The only legitimate complaint about this album is that there just isnt enough, there are a lot of zeppelin classics that I wish could have made it on.  Lastly, it is sad but true, no music since the height of Zeppelin as come close to the incredibly high standard that they set.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Seriously people, how can anyone not like it?  *gasp* Oh no, it isn't hard metal, BLS is ruined.  I mean come on people.  I love BLS, but I have to admit, I get kind of sick after listening to all the heavy metal for long periods of time.  So what, it's slow acoustic rock, it's good.  Honestly listen to the CD before you criticize it just because it's not die-hard metal.  I think it's better than Book of Shadows.  I personally like Zakk's acoustic stuff more than his metal stuff, it sounds so much cooler.  Honestly how can you diss this stuff?  It's good that they went and made a nice slow acoustic rock album.  <br />Everyone who likes Zakk Wylde, or anyone who hasn't even heard of him should get this album.  It's amazing.  The acousticness is awesome.  You can't go wrong with it.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This movie makes me want to play guitar everytime I see it.  Great casting.  I hope there is a commentary track.  Steve Via was perfect and Ralph did a great job playing the young gun.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Woh! The PoA soundtrack is amazing! It is clearly obvious that this soundtrack is a whole lot better than the first two. I have not seen the movie yet, but from the 'Quidditch,Third Year' piece, I can tell that it is going to be outrageously fabulous!<br />The use of instruments is just great, and the way he has made the music alot more mysterious and darker adds to the Wow! Factor. I have to say, 'Finale' is my favorite piece, but I love them all! Highly Recommended! John Williams has outdone himself this time!
