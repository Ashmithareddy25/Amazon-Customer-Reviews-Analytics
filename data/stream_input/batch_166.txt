B000002J2F|4.0|Chances are you probably won't get around to delineating the loose concept, but Phil Collins, fresh off of a divorce and a bout with alcoholism, sounds edgier and meaner on this album than any other I have heard.  The songs tend to be about love and loss, and they all seem to have a cynical bite.  Especially after the dry, somewhat drab production of &quot;And Then There Were Three&quot; _Duke_ comes out like a cannon shot.  I love the desparation in Phil's voice, which carries all the way through _Abacab_ clear into their eponymous 1984 smash.  There's no arguing that the album is more or less the birth of the Genesis pop formula - which I guess means that if you are a fan of the Gabriel days you are supposed to hate it - but as a whole it plays more like a fine, strangely fulfilling 50/50 balance between edgy, quirky 80's prog-rock and choice pop singles.  &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; is the big hit here, althouh you will probably also recognize &quot;Turn it On Again&quot;.  Mike Rutherford puts out some very distinguished guitar work on this album, Collins' drums sound bigger and better than ever, and Tony Banks manages to squeeze out a few more classic keyboard tones on this album.  Its worth getting alone for &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; (redone on Collins' solo LP), the superb &quot;Cul De Sac&quot; which is one of Tony Banks' best compositions, and the epic instrumental &quot;Duke's Travels/Duke's End&quot;, which plays like a hyperspeed version of &quot;Los Endos&quot; before ending with a coda of the opening musical themes for the album.
B00001U03Q|5.0|In a career as long and as varied as Clapton's, there are bound to be different styles and a need for a variety of &quot;best of&quot; volumes.  Some of us who are getting older like to hear different things at different times, and while this is great &quot;background&quot; music as someone else wrote, it sure beats MUZAK. . . and who wouldn't want to get on an elevator and hear Clapton?  He is an artist, a musician, and he is entitled to take his music and package it as he feels at the moment!  I love the old Cream, Derek, and other old stuff, but it's hard play that in an office.  This music brings back so many memories, and the songs are all great songs that I love!  I guess I'm just so totally in love with his work that I love to listen to it ALL!
B00005B4GU|2.0|it's a sad day when a band with as much potential as radiohead subcumbs to the pressure of releasing a glossy pop-ablum.  there are still traces of the raw dark kid a but it's all protrayed in a milder light. nonetheless, radiohead still has potential to pull themselves from the corpropate wasteland that they shun and have inadvertently become part of so don't give up on them yet.
B000059WOD|5.0|First, there is no reason for people to say they hate Linkin Park because its not metal, or its not this or its not that - the reason I LOVE Linkin Park is because they're unlike anything else I have heard. Theyre unique and they're amazing, this album is awesome! I also recommend an awesome group called Furthermore for anyone who likes Linkin, the song are you the walrus - off of their album flourescent jellyfish is awesome - among others!! Linkin Park rocks!
0790749815|5.0|i won't say this is Hitchcock's greatest, but certainly in the top 5. when i first saw this film years ago, i wasn't impressed much. after seeing it for sale on Amazon for [price], and with all those extras such as: a commentary, theatrical trailers, a documentary, a photo gallery, an audio track showcasing the score and a tv spot, i immediately ordered it. after i watched it on DVD, i gained new and undying respect for a nearly forgotten classic in motion picture history. the visuals were magnificent and astounding. definitely worth the money.
0688170528|5.0|I truly recommend this book, I could not put it down.  I read it for my book club and only 1 person out of 12 did not like it (that's a first!)  It really digs into the lives of the 2 families represented and does a great job of telling the story- in detail.  I love the way the story was written, and it's very easy to follow both the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;now&quot;.  Enjoy!
B00000099Y|5.0|This album, like all of their other works, presents songs that also posess a very literary quality to them.  In this albumn for instance, the song 46&amp;2 represents a yearning to change into something better, something that could have been.  Tool has to be one of the best bands that use not only the lyrics tell the story, but the music as well.  I just hope they come to Pittsburgh on their tour<br />Bill Hicks, another dead hero
6305363668|5.0|Blade Runner is, overall, one of science fiction's finest films. The production and directory work is all top-notch, and the film's true standout feature is it's cinematography. With it's excellent, futuristic landscapes and prevading dark and gloomy atmosphere, Blade Runner was one of the first SF &quot;film noirs.&quot; It has had an incalculable influence on subsequent SF movies (and been lovingly parodied in mass media, such as Sierra's Space Quest 6 PC game.) On the surface, it appears to be simply an action/adventure flick with SF elements. However, a deeper inspection reveals unexpected depth. The movie, in it's way, is actually quite profound, and begs of you (like the book it is based on) the allmighty question: what is reality? Speaking of the book, I have heard a lot of people complain that this is a bad adaptation of it, Philip K. Dick's masterpiece Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And, true enough, it leaves out some things from the book and changes others, but this is to be expected for any adaptation. One shouldn't expect a book's purely literary qualities to come across on the silver screen; rather, it is nice instead to see the particular qualities that movies can deliver better-i.e., visuals, cinematography, atmospherics, etc.-focused on instead. And Blade Runner does that to the utmost. It highlights the points of the book that could be made better by movie treatment, and still retains much of it's heft. This is not a bad movie adaptation, this, my friends, is a masterpiece. Watch it today.

B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna Rocks! This is Madonna's best album to date. The revolutionary beats and hooks on this album have already inspired releases by J-Lo (&quot;Play&quot;) and tragically S Club 7 amongst others.<br />The first single (and Madonna's 14th Billboard #1)&quot;Music&quot; is another dance floor killer (complete with the Ghetto Fabulous video) and by now everyone would know the radio favourite &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and the current single &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;.<br />For those of you who have seen the video for &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; be aware the album version is a little slower and has alot more lyrics but is still one of the stand out tracks. The fourth UK single &quot;Amazing&quot; does remind you of 1999's mega-hit &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; but is also appealing. The most beautiful song on the album is &quot;Gone&quot; (Track 10) which has a simple guitar beat and Madonna's naked vocals. The haunting &quot;Paradise...Not For Me&quot; features a french verse and Madonna's most haunting vocals since 1989's &quot;Promise To Try&quot;. Also I have to mention that &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; will rock your world!<br />Overall the album is awesome (except for the versions that unfortunately contain the forgettable &quot;American Pie&quot; as the last track) and is clearly the sound of the 2000/2001 season. I can't wait for the Drowned World tour this summer!
B00003CXRP|5.0|I found this to be a very powerful movie. Some of the reviewers didn't like the fact that there was no happy ending, but I for one loved the ending. It lets the audience draw its own conclusion, which I love. <br />Tom Hanks' performance is amazing, and in a role where the lead actor must carry the movie for an hour while only talking to a volleyball, he is great. I also like this movie for the way the special effects are used. Watch the extras on the second DVD to find out. I prefer special effects that help tell the story, such as this or something like Terminator 2, where the menace of the T-1000 needs the special effects to come to fruition. It clearly shows up movies such as The Phantom Menace, where the special effects are the story. And they made for a bad story.<br />All in all, watch the movie, then watch the extras, then watch the movie again. It will give new respect to the words movie magic.
B000002NJS|5.0|On the eve of the USA leg of her &quot;Drowned World Tour&quot;, I decided I would return to this album as a few of the songs feature on the tour (Frozen/ Ray Of Light/ Candy Perfume Girl / Sky Fits Heaven / Mer Girl &amp; Frowned World) and I hadn't listened to it since the release of &quot;Music&quot; last year. <br />This album sounds better than it did 3 years ago. As with 1992's &quot;Erotica&quot;, Madonna was again ahead of her time. Standout tracks are the club favourites &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot;, the incredible &quot;Frozen&quot; and the song dedicated to the late Gianni Versace, &quot;Swim&quot;. An incredible commerical and critical success in 1998, this album is a must for any popular music cd collector.<br />Other outstanding Madonna albums are: Music (2000), Like A Prayer (1989) and the classic Madonna (1983)
0380789019|3.0|I was disappointed in the book.  It has an interesting concept, but never lives up to its potential.  Although most of the book takes place in the underground, we never learn very much about it.  For example, we experience very little of the politics of the underground, when that is potentially the most interesting part of the story.  Unfortunately, the underground functions really only as the setting for an uninspired storyline (if I never read another renegade angel story, I'll die a happy man) that could have taken place anywhere.  Also, while it's hard to dislike Richard, he's never very engaging as a lead character.  His &quot;growth&quot; through the novel is unconvincing.  Characters don't grow simply because things happen to them.  They grow as they learn from their experiences and change their behavior accordingly.  Richard never changes his behavior.  He never really does anything.  Things simply happen to him.  That does not make for engaging character development.  Yet, although I was generally disappointed in the novel, I do think it's a good lightweight action adventure and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, enjoyable read.  The underground is fertile territory for more stories.  Hopefully Gaiman will explore it in depth in the future.
630463949X|4.0|One star taken away only due to the fact that I don't consider this the highest video quality, but that's being picky. Once again,if you are a Mac fan, you need this. The U.S.C. marching band alone on TUSK is worth the price of admission.
6304466498|3.0|You definitely have to be in the right frame of mind when you watch this one.  At times it is hilarious, but at others it is just a little too silly for me.  If you enjoy the Mel Brooks style of humor though, you will not be disappointed.  It's also kind of cool seeing an actor like Bill Pullman (of Independence Day fame) in one of his earlier roles.  As for family viewing, younger kids may not get the jokes which spoof even earlier movies such as Saturday Night fever.  And although this movie is rated PG13, the characters cuss just a little too much for it to be appropriate for younger viewers.
B00004Z511|5.0|As with the limited ed. of Amnesiac, there are no extra songs, etc., included with this limited ed.  All the difference is in the gimmicky packaging.  So once again, if you're just into the music but not the artwork, this is not worthwhile.  In this case you get a book modelled after toddler books, the type with short, wide pages printed on glossy, thick cardboard pages with only a minimum of prose on each page (except for the last page which is a list of factual info about worldwide glacier melting stats, a warning about global warming).<br />Unlike the Amnesiac limited, almost all of the artwork (except for some very magnified details that are unrecognizable from the regular ed., including the above-pictured cover) is new, and you do actually get a story instead of just artwork.  In this case, it is a strange, philosophical treatise on the concept of &quot;nothing&quot;.  Once again, I personally find the limited ed. quite cool, but would prefer some extra music as well.  One complaint: the cd is difficult to remove from its pocket.
B000004C32|5.0|Serge is an acquired taste, also theres the &quot;French thing&quot; that some of your immature friends may call you on. I say dont let them get you down, when you can really get down with the funky  @&amp;(! on this CD. Also, this album conjures up many moods what with the amazing strings and vocal choir arrangements that add that extra special magic to the barebones 3 piece lineup of guitar, drums, and bass. Unfortunately, I can't understand French but Serge sounds great. As usual his vocals are way up in the mix... This album is a classic and will inspire the best in you. Once you start to listen to this, you wont be able to get it out of your head.    Background : I have been trying to get my hands on this cd for months and I finally found a copy in NYC on St. Marks St., also there is a great article about Serge in a recent edition of MOJO magazine.
0767817729|4.0|Tony Scott's &quot;Revenge&quot; is an excellent film, violent and uncompromising. It begins like a hackneyed version of &quot;Top Gun&quot; but once Kevin Costner gets to Mexico it becomes a mesmerizing and beautifully realized tale of blood and passion. Kevin Costner has rarely been so good. Madeleine Stowe not only looks and acts wonderfully but is fully convincing down to the accent of an upper class Mexican trophy wife. Anthony Quinn's performance was probably the last great one of a long and outstanding career. Even the smaller roles are beautifully rendered: Miguel Ferrer and a really young and touching John Leguizamo, Joaquin Martinez, Sally Kirkland, and a beautifully wrinkled actress who plays the Mexican curandera. I only wish that the great Tomas Milian (&quot;Traffic,&quot; &quot;Havana&quot;) had gotten more screen time. This DVD cries out for a commentary by Jim Harrison and Scott.
B00003CXRP|3.0|This is a good movie as the other reviews will attest, but the commentary is terrible. It is a combined effort of the director, the cinematographer and the chief sound guy. The problem is that the sound man does about 80% of the talking, and after hearing for the 5th time how they created the sound of a given wave so it was just right, it is tiresome. It would be better if the director and writer were the ones to do all of the talking. The technical stuff is interesting in limited doses, what is more intriguing is information that supports the development of the production, the plot and the characters.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Radiohead's fifth album, Amnesiac, is somewhat of a disappointment, especially considering the past heights that the band has reached.  Despite, for the most part, being superior to the majority of new music being produced in recent years, it pales in comparison to Radiohead's three previous efforts, The Bends, OK Computer, and Kid A.<br />Recorded at the same time as the far-superior Kid A, Amnesiac continues to tread water in a sea of (pseudo) experimentalist ambient noise, robotic cacophony, and distorted, repetitive vocals.  Not surprisingly, both albums sound very similar at times; however, whereas Kid A's songs complement each other, forming what turns out in the end to be a coherent whole, Amnesiac comes out as more uneven, fragmented and directionless than its predecessor.  Consequently, as it lacks the continuity and fluidity of an album, it sounds more like a collection of B-sides and studio outtakes.  <br />On a positive note, Amnesiac still contains some decent material.  The album starts strong, with the minimalist drumbeats and keyboards of \\"Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box\\".  \\"Pyramid song\\" is the best song on the album, with some fine piano and vocal work by Thom Yorke.  Other highlights include the more mainstream \\"I Might be Wrong\\" and \\"Knives Out\\", which, somewhat surprisingly, feature guitars quite prominently in the mix.  <br />The rest of the album, however, is mired in mediocrity, and is less consistent.  \\"Pulk/pull revolving doors\\", with its stop/start rhythm and mangled vocals, is reminiscent of Kid A's title track; however, this experiment was done before, not to mention it was better the first time around.  \\"You and whose army\\", \\"Dollars &amp; cents\\", and \\"Life in a glass house\\", while they are beautifully arranged songs, are weakened by perhaps Yorke's most whiny, annoying vocal efforts to date.  <br />The remaining songs are throwaways.  The alternate version of \\"Morning bell\\" is far inferior to the one that appears on Kid A, andshould not have been included in this collection.  \\"Like spinning plates\\" is merely an experiment in reverse studio effects, and is more a curiosity than an album track.  \\"Hunting bears\\", however, is perhaps the most frustrating song on the entire album.  It is a two-minute guitar/bass buildup to nothing that should have been developed into an epic, but is instead utterly disposable.<br />With Amnesiac, Radiohead has quite obviously made an album out of the leftovers from the Kid A sessions.  There are still some good songs, but on the whole this is less an album than a collection of cutting-room floor artifacts.  Radiohead should have called it &quot;Kid B&quot;.
0140283587|3.0|I just finished this book after reading Sutcliffe's \\"Love Hexagon\\", which I thought was brilliant. However, this one was a bit of a disappointment.<br />Having done extensive traveling around the world in my gap year at the age of nineteen I am absolutely sure that my behavior and thoughts went beyond Dave's, the books main character. The book deals with too many stereotypes (these are actually out there among those backpackers) and lacks the more sophisticated British humour found in the \\"Love Hexagon\\". India deserves a more \\"normal\\" portrait and so does traveling with a backpack, which you use to carry your things around in an efficient and convenient manner. There are enough incidents that provoke laughs and fantastic surprises!!!
B00005LMBK|3.0|I was really psyched for this album, the songs available at fans.gorillaz.com (&quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;19-2000&quot;) are both excellent, Dan the Automator seemed to be doing a good job expanding his range from trip-hop to pop music, and it was good to see more of Del.  But this album is clearly Dan's weakest yet.  Although there's no incompetently arranged or produced tracks, it's often generic and forgettable, two words not usually associated with Dan.  This album is the &quot;2 good songs, 2 OK songs, and a lot of filler&quot; that I hear mainstream rock music fans complaining about.<br />I think the main problem with this album is that the producer can only do so much, at some point it comes down to the source material.  I'm not familiar with this guy from Blur, but I really can't take him in any more than very small doses.  His laconic tone works well as a counterpoint to Del's smooth-but-enthused delivery in &quot;Clint Eastwood.&quot;  But aside from that song, he does nothing but add poor melodies with intensely annoying lyrics and a repetetive delivery.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|If you're interested in finding the songs you heard from the movie on this soundtrack, you're in for a disappointment.  I wanted to give the soundtrack a rating of 3.5, but I decided to round up.  Although it did include &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; it didn't include movie favorites such as &quot;Spectacular Spectacular.&quot;  I wanted to hear all of the songs.  Hopefully a second volume will be released, but who knows?...  Nicole Kidman comes out as an adequate singer, but who knew Ewan had it in him to be such a crooner?  The songs bring a smile to my face and makes me think of his twinkling eyes.  So, basically buy the soundtrack if you must, but really, just buy the DVD when it comes out.
B00004WGYA|1.0|This cd contains edited versions of some of the tracks. It doesn't compare to the Lp or cassette. The tracks &quot;Rio&quot; and &quot;My Own Way&quot; are different mixes while &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot; and &quot;Hold Back The Rain&quot; are edited shorter versions. They used the wrong master tape. Avoid!!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I loved the CD. The fact that the vocals from the movie were used made it great. If you liked the movie, you will love the sound track.

B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack is perfect for any music lover. I am familiar with other works by Hans Zimmer but this has got to be his best. The music really brings out the emotions in the film. It's suspensful and along with the movie it keeps you on the edge of your seat. My personal favorites are the climactic Barbarian Horde, the thrilling The Battle, and the emotional Now We Are Free. Lisa Gerrards haunting and sublime vocals add beauty and texture to the music. I loved this music so much I learned it on piano and performed it in a talent show at school. It can lift your spirit and take you to a place that exists only in the world of music. I think that this CD would have done just as good even without the film. I fell in love with soundtrack weeks before I acctually saw Gladiator.
0201633612|5.0|This is the bible of design patterns. Everyone that understands a little bit about object oriented design knows this book. It explains what design patterns are, how they are used and have a small catalog of very useful DP. Probably the most useful small list of patterns you will ever see in your life. Anyone serious about software development needs this book in the bookshelf, and, as far as I have seen, all serious developers have it handy. The examples are in C++ and the diagrams in OMT. A more modern approach would use Java and UML, but it absolutely does not depreciate the value of the pearls you will find in its pages.
B00005B602|5.0|This lovely CD is the soundtrack to a very new movie revolutionizing French cinema.  The film, &quot;Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain,&quot;(the fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain) has quickly darted to the tops of everyone's charts.  I sat mesmerized for the entirity of the time.  Everyone that sees this film is bewitched and wooed dangerously into falling head over heels into Amelie's world.  The all to real consequence being the crash at the end when the lights come up and the music fades.  I have scoured high and low for this soundtrack and to my sheer delight I have finally found it. It is a wonderful mix of old fashioned accordian music and the songs we all used to hum as children, the written tunes of which never really existed outside our heads.  I heartily recomend the soundtrack and the movie to anyone.  No one has been disappointed yet.
0789723107|4.0|If you need to learn about web usability and you are in a hurry (like usually computer people are), this book is for you. It is short and goes direct to the point. The author point out what worth to worry about focusing on what work, instead of the millions of ways it wouldn't work. He doesn't take out your freedom, giving you principles instead of recipes. The book is well structured and very practical to use. It stays with the basics. If your work is usability you'll need other sources, but &quot;Don't make me think&quot; is a great kick off.
B00005B7CK|5.0|makes fun of the south, but it is a funny movie.
0793518326|4.0|This book have all songs officially recorded by the Beatles. It includes songs of others composers, like John Lee Hooker, not only songs written by the Beatles themselves. It doesn't have non-official songs, like the early ones recorded live in Germany. You will find scores and tablatures for most of the instruments used in the record sessions (sorry, no orchestras parts), always including guitars, bass and drums. The songs are very close to the actual recording, and so are a little bit hard to play. You can simplify using the chords shown above the scores, but if you are not interested in solos and perfect playing you should buy simpler material. There are a few typos and the lyrics and notes are very small. Besides that this is the best and most complete Beatles songbook you will ever find.
6303407188|4.0|Ed Wood, Jr. is more beloved than reviled as the \\"creative mind\\" behind such grade-z movies as \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", \\"Glen or Glenda\\". Though it's generally accepted that Wood wasn't playing it straight with his horrible scripts (\\"he's been killed, murdered....and somebody's responsible!\\"; \\"Future events like these will affect you in the future!\\"), unbelievable special effects and nonesensical plots, this film slightly suggests that Wood actually bought into his own nonsense. Here, Johnny Depp (is there anything he can't do?) plays the beloved but infamous Ed, a WWII vet, failed movie maker and transvestite. Playing Ed as if doing an extended Jon Lovitz impression (his lines delivered all high-pitched and non-stop), Depp's Ed is mostly innocuous and guiless (his genuine belief in the implausible predictions of self-proclaimed seer, Criswell, are a hoot) and incapable of seeing his own sheer lunacy. The script uses \\"Glen\\" and \\"Plan 9\\" as bookends on Ed's checkered career - with the first film marking his collaboration with the then well-faded horror star, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), and the second marking a sort of tribute to the star who died before its completion. Director Tim Burton stocks the film with a well-rounded cast - Bill Murray as transvestite \\"Bunny\\" Breckenridge, Jeff Jones as Criswell, Sarah Jessica Parker as Ed's long suffering girl friend, Dolores, Lisa Marie as \\"Vampira\\" and George Steele as Tor Johnson - that's a lot of fun, but doesn't do much with them. Bill Murray seems at times the saddest transvestite in history, mulling his paltry earnings from Ed's flicks to pay for his \\"procedure\\" while Jones' Criswell puts a damper on things when he makes all too clear how he invents his predictions. Instead, Burton's attentions are reserved for Ed and Bela, with Landau turning in a performance that's in turns hysterical (when revealing his hatred for arch-rival Boris Karloff), heartbreaking and terrifying (the forgotten star dies trying to kick a heavy heroin habit). Even so, the script doesn't stay consistent, with the emotional and humours highs isolated in their own scenes. The script reaches a depth of sorrow and horror when revealing Lugosi's profound suffering in de-tox, yet only briefly. (The script dangles the question of how well the dying star recognized the inanity of Woods' work).  In other moments, the film hints at other real-life horrors like Ed's war experiences, but much of the film is actually shy of risk. Much of the conflict is between Ed and his backers - mostly evangelicals conned into thinking they were financing a religious picture and slowly realize Ed's true caliber as a film maker. Ed fights back to preserve his artistic vision without having to prove what his vision is or whether he even has one. His flagging self-confidence is restored by a chance encounter with Orson Welles (Vincent DoNofrio, also an underappreciated Hollywood fixture, his lines dubbed by the same guy who voices \\"Brain\\" on \\"Pinky and the Brain\\").  The more famed director is about to start work on a troubled epic of his own which, though never named, will be instantly recognizable to film students as \\"A Touch of Evil\\" (\\"Can you imagine Charlton Heston as a Mexican Cop?\\", Welles laments). Plunging ahead, the film works to the climax of Ed's career- the infamous \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\"! With Ed's trademark horrible special effects, unintelligible plot and insultingly poor script, \\"Plan\\" is almost guaranteed cult-status. Burton only recreates some of the scenes, so the last few minutes of the film plays like a montage of SNL skits, with Ed almost crying as he savors each frame. Leaving Ed before the credits roll on his \\"masterpiece\\", we never see Ed's lowly ends, his own substance abuse problems or the more clearly horrible films that marked his latter years. Burton never confronts this and misses an ironic motherlode - whether the ridiculous fantasy of Ed's pictures were supposed to be scary, or whether in seemingscary but so ineptly so, they were actually meant to symbolize a safer world than the one he experienced for real.
B000002MY3|5.0|Initially, I was going to call this the Sgt. Pepper of the '90s, but naturally worried about misinterpretation and claims of hyperbole.  So, I'll explain.  This album's all about angst, feminine angst in particular, and universal angst.  Whether about scholastic performance, religious conformance, or relationship mis-performance, this album captures, in a zeitgeist way, the social troubles bothering yuppie America in the &quot;Me Generation&quot; 90s.  With the stock market soaring and economic spirits up, we could afford to fret over our flies in our Chardonnay (as she sings about in &quot;Ironic&quot; which, as everyone knows, isn't about irony as much as happenstance annoyances) or about our latest botched relationship.  The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper tried to do the same with mid/late-60s' themes.  Both rock in their own way.  Otherwise, I'm pushing the comparisons.  'Nuf said about that.<br />Here's why I gave the album five stars: 1) Very high sound and production quality.  It's an honest recording, showcasing Ms. Morissete's emotive voice while exercising studio restraint; 2) No weak tracks -- all the songs evidence good-to-excellent songwriting and the music fits the lyrics; 3) Despite radio's overplaying of certain songs (as mentioned by many reviewers) when the album came out, all the tracks have worn well and are interesting after repeated listening.<br />Anyone who can incorporate getting hit with a splintered ruler into a song gets my highest recommendation.
B00003CXRM|5.0|For those of you who complained about this movie, you obviosly have never read the Odyssey, by Homer, upon which this movie was loosely based. For me, being quite familiar with the story, &quot;O Brother&quot; came alive. Those scenes that &quot;dont help the plot along&quot; are actually cleverly inserted parallels to stories contained in the Odyssey. For example, the Sirens, the Cyclops, Ulysses' decent into hell, and fighting against his wife's suitors. Nearly every scene had a clever parallel, which made this movie more enjoyable ten-fold. Add the ingenuity with a genuinely funny screen-play and a stand-out performance by George Clooney, and you got yourself a winner. Kudos to the Coen Brothers
B000023VR9|5.0|Dr. Dre is back and proves in this album that he still has what it takes to make one of the best rap cds I've ever heard.  He collaborates with other talented rappers including Eminem, Snoop Dog, and many others.  The great thing about this cd is that every song is great, so you can just turn the cd on and let it play with out having to skip any tracks.  Each track is different too.  I bout the cd just for the Dr. Dre/Eminem duet but was very excited to find out that the whole cd is good.  If you like rap music, I promise you will thorougly enjoy this cd.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Ever tried UN-scrambling eggs? Ever get a 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle of the seas and the cloudless skies for Christmas? Well, this is how you'll feel with &quot;Memento&quot;. This fascinating flick, destined to rack up the Academy Awards,is an example of one of the most original methods of filming &amp; editing. Based on 10 minute segments going BACKWARDS, this movie unfolds into a terrific thriller! Leonard (Guy Pearce) is out to seek revenge on the person who raped &amp; killed his wife and left him without short term memory. Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) is his &quot;buddy(?)&quot; cop(?)! BOTH deserve awards for their performances! The ending is fascinating but I can only say one more thing: Rent it, buy it, whatever...just SEE it. Not for the simple minded or Van Damme fans (Ha!)
0380973650|4.0|American Gods is an enjoyable read--I didn't find it quite as entertaining or imaginative as Neverwhere, but it still delivers.  Gaiman may be slightly handicapped by his choice of actors--in Neverwhere, his imagination had more room to roam, while I got the feeling the gods in American Gods constrained him to some degree.  The climax of the story is, as is fairly typical with Gaiman, more anticlimax than a real ripsnorter.  I did feel he could have done a little more with his main character, who is told at one point that he doesn't seem fully alive by his very loving (and dead) wife--unfortunately, I rather agreed with her assessment.
B00000AFWZ|4.0|Okay. I'm not going to be a punk rock snob and make fun of the last reviewer who complained about this not being &quot;punk enough&quot; for him, and then tried to sell us on the new Blink 182, and proudly mentioned that he was from the hometown of Eminem and Insane Clown Posse.<br />No. I'm much above that.<br />What I will talk about is how essential this box set is. &quot;Nuggets&quot; has a dozens of great 60's garage rock songs, though, unfortunately, it does delve into bubblegum and psychedelia more than I'd like it to. Still, if you're looking to get into the 60's garage band sound, this is the place to start, with everything from the Sonics' down-and-dirty &quot;Strychnine,&quot; to the Music Machine's snotty &quot;Talk Talk&quot; (Attention Murder City Devils! Sean Bonniwell wants his schtick back!), The Elastik Band's aptly titled &quot;Spazz,&quot; and the Brogues' achingly soulful take on &quot;I Ain't No Miracle Worker.&quot;<br />Like I mentioned earlier, there are quite a few dippy, bubblegum, psychedelic pop-flavored songs, but there certainly is enough tough-as-nails fuzz guitar and farfisa rock to warrant the purchase, and afterwards, if you're hungering for more of the dirtier side of mid 60's rock dished up here, Crypt Records's &quot;Back From The Grave&quot; or &quot;Teenage Shutdown&quot; series are wise, wise, investments.

B00003CWTI|1.0|First of all, they shouldn't even give an editor's credit for this movie, since you could cut out about 45 minutes from this 3 hour behemoth and not lose anything from the story. But that is an example of the film's problem: this movie feels like a first draft which was never finished. You could also cut out the entire frog dopping sequence, which doesn't alter any of the characters' motivations and thus doesn't add anything  (except some bizarre, uninterpretable arty element) to the film. A good cast is squandered with a lazy, foul-mouthed, and yet surprisingly predictable script. I was interested for the first 90 minutes (I even survived Aimee Mann's dreadful rendition of \\"One Is The Loneliest Number\\" drowning out the dialogue at the beginning) as the multiple stories unfurled and film moved daftly between comedy and tragedy, but then the film slows to a crawl and wallows in pathos, while all of these wretched, utterly unlikable characters (whom suddenly become inspired and sing along to another of Mann's abysmal songs in a scene that's unintentionally laughable) try to rectify all the dumb things they've done. A very ambitious film, but a film so ambitious needs to have a point. I can accept a bad film made by bad filmmakers, but such junk thrown at us by talented an auteur as Paul Thomas Anderson is really dismaying.

B0000026DJ|5.0|This band hit a high mark with this release. Actally I think the big hit &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; is actually one of the weaker tracks here. The Oils made powerful music with strong messages that stands the test of time and sounds vital to this day. This and 10,9,8 ... are thier two best.

B00000D9TK|4.0|Not all together as successful as was DEUX the first opus of CLINE and GOLDMAN,S'IL SUFFISAIT D'AIMER nevertheless won't disapoint CLINE's true fans.There are excellent songs like the title track obviously intented as a hit and also EN ATTENDANT SES PAS(i like this kind of song from her)and DANS UN AUTRE MONDE a good rhythm song.That's the best part of the cd.Now going to the negative side,i must say that i don't like JE CHANTERAI and it's gospel touch unsuited for CLINE.I can say the same thing about TERRE,a soul song that simply don't work.CLINE's fans have the last word,and as a whole they should enjoy it.Let me just say as a conclusion,that a third opus would certainly be of interest.
0345423496|2.0|This book is, thank God, better than the atrocity that was 2061.  There are some interesting ideas about the future - especially religion.  The story is mildy entertaining, though quite uneventful.  However, three quarters through this book, Clarke decides he needs to go ahead and end the series.  He slaps together an extremely anticlimatic, sloppy ending, leaving you completely dumbfounded that more thought and effort wasn't put into concluding this series.  Clarke's inconsistencies throughout these books were annoying as well.  It seems as if each book changes or contradicts something that happened in a previous story.  Bottom line - 2001 was great.  2010 was a cool addition, although not necessary.  2061 and 3001 are simply superfulous to the storyline and add little to the original masterpiece.  Life is too short for such mediocre, unentertaining books.
B000002UYZ|3.0|Most people have already heard most of the songs here, so I won't review them except to write that they are almost all of five-star quality.    So why the lower rating? Well, this is a two-disc compilation, which means there's room here for two and half hours of music. But the combined length of the \\"Red Album\\" is 15 minutes less than the potential length of one compact disc. Consdering how much good early Beatles material was not included on this, the CD release should have added more songs. Or it simply could have put the original two LPs on ONE CD -- as apposed to wasting an extra disc and setting the list price of this collection at more than $30. What a disgrace!
B00002E23E|5.0|For this movie to be viewed in its proper context, it should be seen immediately after a screening of SPINAL TAP! It is absolute, freaking Comic GENIUS! The way John Paul Jones got stuck in that pod?! Or Peter Grant, beating up on a TV set with a cricket bat! Or the party Jimmy Page was at, (you know, with that wench from the Nanny?) when they couldn't come up with a name for the album (later known as UNTITLED)? Unspeakably hilarious....
B00000G3PA|5.0|Although for the exception of PEARL HARBOR, Director MICHAEL BAY has shown improvment every film he directs, along with his sidekick producer- Jerry Bruckheimer.<br />BAY's third blockbuster film, ARMAGEDDON, is the adventure story of oil drillers recruited by NASA to stop an asteriod the size of Texas, from colliding with Earth.  ARMAGEDDON brings all-star actors: BRUCE WILLIS (Die Hard Trilogy, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), BEN AFFLECK (Pearl Harbor, Dogma, Reindeer Games), BILLY BOB THORTON (Pushing Tin, A Simple Plan), LIV TYLER (That Thing You Do, Inventing the Abbots), WILL PATTON (Gone in 60 Seconds) and STEVE BUSCEMI (Con Air, Billy Madison).<br />MY REVIEW:<br />&quot;ARMAGEDDON is great!  Why do so many people put this movie down?  This movie is perfect in every aspect!  The adventure, special effects, acting and story is phenomenal!  This is one of my favorite movies!  The BAY/BRUCKHEIMER team never fails in my book!  This is far better than it's competitor- DEEP IMPACT!  ARMAGEDDON is a great rush of excitment!  It is also emotional, inspiring and humorous!  See this movie immediately!  It is spectacular!&quot;- MJV &amp; the Movies.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have to say that seeing Radiohead live recently turned around my opinion of this record. Suddenly, music that I had dismissed as self-indulgent and empty came alive, and I &quot;got it&quot;. <br />Radiohead are possibly unique in contemporary mainstream rock in that they have a sound that is original. It strikes me that they have defined a near perfect blend of indie, techno and ambient.

It just might change your mind. It certainly did mine.
0446677450|2.0|I see this book as nothing more than a good money maker for the author. He appeals to peoples emotions and is very repeatitive about the same principles.

0790729628|5.0|Ridley Scott has, with Blade Runner, defined a genre. Within this movie, you will find the roots of The Fifth Element, Terminator, and a hundred other films. The &quot;gritty future&quot; film was not invented by Scott; but it was perfected here.<br />Further, the DVD finally restores Ridley's vision to the film, removing the &quot;happy ending&quot; and the voice-over that not even Harrison Ford could stand. The movie is finally viewable as it was always meant to be, and the story unfolds brilliantly.<br />While lacking in extras, the quality of Blade Runner, the film, is more than enough to carry this disc into a permanent place in every serious film lover's collection.
B000001ESJ|5.0|I have always had mixed feelings about this band.   They are fanastic musicians, most notably Neil Peart who is one of the two best drummers in rock,(Golden Earring's Ceasar Z) being the other.  Their songs are great and have meaning and are a joy to see live. I have though always found Lees' voice a bit hard to take.  This is a classic led by my favorite Rush song, Xanadu. Geddy Lee keeps his screeching to a bare minimum and the result is a fantastic listenable album.   Listened to it today and just might again tomorrow.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Let me start by saying that I wasn't expecting (or even wanting) another OK Computer with this album.  I loved Kid A, which was an adventurous, glorious album; though not entirely successful, it was a brave departure from the style and sound of OKC and probably necessary for the growth of the band.  <br />Amnesiac, on the other hand, is bland where Kid A was exciting, stifling rather than expansive.  In the end it is repetitive and without adding much to the statement already made with their last album.<br />Though not likely their fault, my disappointment was only added to by the fact that their record company (if not the band itself) had billed it several months ago as the &quot;real&quot; album from the Kid A sessions, where the first would be more of an experiment.  On the contrary, Amnesiac feels more like a throwaway than the first.  Maybe released concurrently and without unrealistic billing it would have been more satisfying.<br />Hell, if you are a Radiohead fan you have to buy it, but you can still call them on what is a minor work from this notable band.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have to say that seeing Radiohead live recently turned around my opinion of this record. Suddenly, music that I had dismissed as self-indulgent and empty came alive, and I &quot;got it&quot;. Despite the ambient feel, this does not work as background music, at least for me. This is music to really &quot;listen to&quot;, like Van Morrison's &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, or Joy Division or Tom Waits... You need to pay attention.<br />Radiohead are possibly unique in contemporary mainstream rock in that they have a sound that is original.

0440180295|5.0|For some reason Vonnegut has always escaped my &quot;Favorite Authors&quot; lists.  I love him, and each of his books...  There are few authors who are so prolific and yet so talented.  Still, I always overlook him.  I have decided to stop now.  I am coming out for the first time: Kurt Vonnegut is one of my top five favorite authors.<br />The thing is, Vonnegut is weird.  His stories, his novels, his essays...  They are all weird.  Still, they are hysterically, brilliantly weird, and that is something I can stand by.  I dont want to give away specific details of this weird book, because that ruins something, but believe me, it is great.  Suffice it to say there are alien abductions, porn stars and much more.<br />Oh, what an awful, awful sentance preceded this one.  I apologize.  Read the book.  Trust me.  Its a keeper.
B000050FEN|5.0|From the beginning, intruiges and never disappoints. The excitement and build-up of the film pay off with a satisfying conclusion that makes the movie &quot;whole,&quot; in many senses. Without giving too much away, I'll continue.<br />Se7en places Morgan Freeman in the role he knows best: disgruntled detective at odds with the world and society. Indeed, in many ways, Morgan Freeman has been cast in little else since this film, precisely because he does such a smashing job in it. Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast, too, are excellent, but Freeman's performance makes this film.<br />In short: not for the weak-stomached, but the story is solid and the acting is superb.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I picked this up last week after not hearing it since something like '74.  Trower was one of my favorite guitarists of the time based on his work with Procol Harum.  When this one came out (after I was sorely disappointed to not find him at the first Procol concert I went to), I wasn't all that taken with the music - the strat was just so different.<br />So, I listened to it and liked what I heard when I got it.  I got to about cut 7 or 8 and started really hearing it and had to put it back on from the beginning.  Funny thing these comparisons to Hendrix - they're based on the sonics.  Underneath them, every chop is pure Trower - the most tasteful of that time's guitarists maybe excepting Peter Green.  I can't pick a favorite between them because they're both so full of soul and feeling in everything they do.<br />The strat for Trower seems like a more sensitive or subtle instrument in some way, though I do miss the purity of that Les Paul now and then.  <br />A fine album, with really nicely written songs. Didn't appreciate Dewar enough back then either.  If you like bluesy rock with imagination and integrity, and like hearing a master of the electric who plays to the songs, you won't be wasting a buck on this one.
B000056NX4|4.0|That's probably when the next remake is done and God only knows what it will look like.  If it's as good as this 2001 remake, I'm sure the Almighty will enjoy it as much as I have.  Yes.  This is not the 1973 movie and there aren't any hippies.  Don't you get me wrong, the '73 movie was good, but let's not be too sentamental.  in the new film, orchestrations, instrumental performance and vocals are top-notch, except perhaps for Judas who can't quite seem to handle the technical parts of his score.  Performers are playing to the back of a hall, not overacting.  Caiphas, Pilate, Simon the Zealot, Jesus and Mary M. are all the best.  This performance is far more in-your-face than the '73 movie and frankly makes a lot more sense to somebody my age (Gen Xer)--not because it lacks subtlety (it doesn't).  It's just less dispassionate!
B000002J1B|5.0|When I first heard Relayer, it scared me (A couple of my friends--huge Yes fans--were listening to it in total awe and I was afraid that the world was coming to an end:  I had no idea what Yes were, or what was going on).        Now that Yes music has grown on me over the years, I'm also a huge Yes fan and hear Relayer in the way that other true fans do also.  I hear a very balanced, complex and beautiful masterpiece.

B00005BJ2O|3.0|I am going to have to agree with some of the first reviews of this CD that I read, commenting on the CD's lack of material from the movie. I, too thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was a bit disappointed that many of its best songs are not present on the soundtrack. Personally, I was pretty pumped for &quot;like a virgin&quot;. The songs sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman that are included on the CD, however, are great. I was just hoping for a more complete version of the film's music. I think it would be a good idea if they released a CD of the movie's complete music.

B00000AFFF|5.0|if you're an EC fan of stuff like pump it up and radio radio only, this may disappoint you.this is a lot more sedate than armed forces or get happy or this years model, but don't mistake mellower music as EC losing his skill for turning a barbed phrase. on painted from memory he's teamed with 70's tunesmith bacarach on what rolling stone called &quot; a stunning, vital song cycle&quot;. they were right. the songwriting here is top shelf, two 20th century masters of pop crafting some fascinating music. combining this brilliant, melodically  beautiful music with such a gutwrenching, heartbreaking vocal narrative yields an experience like no other. i vividly remember sitting on a rooftop watching the sun set while listening to the title track and thinking about a lost love who was moving 3,000 miles away as one of the most cathartic experiences i've ever had. if you've ever had a love gone wrong or a relationship blow up and erupt (and who hasn't) or maybe someone you liked but never told them (me), this cd will rip off all those healed scabs...and you'll love it for it anyway.
B0000019PA|5.0|i enjoy this album very much.  i understand that not everybody will like it. but - the ones who do understand this album know that it doesn't need five stars, or to go double platinum...it is just very good to listen to.  most of the people who regard this album as &quot;pure genious&quot; are the ones who are a little more open and aren't preoccupied with 'taste'.  so if you're concerned with finding pop songs or an easy album to get into, then this isn't for you.  but if you like music (all kinds of music) and don't expect everything from every album, then buy it, cause you might like it.  but you might not
B000000WJZ|3.0|Typically in rock music, America invents a sound/genre and then Britain refines it. For instance,  Radiohead has taken REM's sound to higher ground. In the case of the Pumpkins, the reverse is happening. My Bloody Valentine and Jesus and Marychain are the obvious influences here, but Corgan has stripped away some layers and has substituted Kevin Shields's shoe-gazing introversion for a more aggressive and adrenilizing demeanor. The results are wonderful - raw, punky, confrontational while sophisticated and coherent. Cherub Rock marries Pixies, MBV and Black Sabbath to create a spellbinding wall of sound. But what gives it coherence and originality is Billy Corgan's voice. Not as crazed as Frank Black and not as subdued as Kevin Shields - it's the voice of a worldly punk-rocker with a mature sensibility.  The rest of the album almost fulfills the promise of the first track. It's still a worth having in your collection
B00003CWOL|5.0|This movie was very funny from the opening segment where View Askew was apologizing to Platipi enthusiasts to the last scene where the 3 main charactors are sitting at the steps of the church.<br />Kevin Smith is a great director and Dogma shows how wonderful he really is. Dogma has a funny and creative story that shows how hes matured as a writer and director from Mallrats.  (*note* I liked Mallrats, but I agree with most, Mallrats wasn't nearly as good as any of the other Kevin Smith flicks)
B00003CXDG|3.0|I bought it 'cuz I watched it in the theater and I though  it is a cool movie. But as I watch repeatedly, I started to get tired of it because of the long bike-racing and fighting scene at the end of the movie. (I think first and middle part of the movie is pretty good...)<br />If it is'nt &quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot;, it's acceptable. But I felt these scences spoiled the theme of Mission Impossible.<br />If you really like the original one, I don't recommend U  to buy this stuff.
0684833395|3.0|Catch-22 started off incredibly witty and profound and well, good.  But after the first few chapters the humor gets old and repetitive, and towards the end of the book the humor was either no longer there or I no longer found it even mildly amusing. I had to force myself to finish the book and it took me weeks.  The book also wasn't very action-packed. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, and I thought it was somewhat insightful into war and human nature, but after awhile I found it to be tiresome and worn out. I'd recommend it for the first few chapters alone, and some of the characters are hilarious, but expect redundancy.
0671027573|1.0|There are so many things that were unappealing about this book.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the sinister/comedy aspect was jarring.  If done properly, this can work, but Ms. Howard failed to wed the two and the result was choppy. There would be a chapter on the very sick and scary bad guy, then suddenly the next chapter would be back to the (supposedly) funny stuff...and I really can't say I found this book to be humorous, at all.  The main character was uninspiring (Jaine) and her romantic interest was a total cliche.  I also found the premise weak, that this &quot;List&quot; would generate such intense media interest.  Save your money -- this book is not worth the paper it's written on.  Normally I like to pass the books I enjoy on to friends, but this one ended up in the trash can.
6305363668|5.0|This is one of the greatest films ever!  Using the science fiction genre very effectively, it is really about 'man's inhumanity to man'.  The rich and powerful, Capitalists once again, have 'created' 'androids', which they call 'replicants', which are human beings made bit by bit by genetecists, rather than in one go by natural means, and they have 'denied' them their humanity, and thus their human rights.  In this way, they have created, effectively, a 'slave' 'race'/ people, whom they 'may' exploit as they will.     Some, for example, they have made as 'pleasure models', 'used' for for sexual purposes, and psychologically shaped to fit the role, and others are 'used' for warfare, created solely to fight the battles of their 'creators', suffering in their places all of the horrors of the wars which their 'creators' chose be fought.  Some of these 'androids'/human-made humans reach earth, intending to revenge themselves upon their 'makers' for creating them for exploitation, suffering, and an early death.  One of them survives long enough to kill one of these 'people', but he dies soon afterwards, his lifespan having been determined by his genes at precisely thirty years.  His victory feels empty, in a world where noone cares about it, except him.  As he dies, he mourns the loss, so early at thiry years of age, and with noone to pass them on to , of his memories of the amazing cosmic sights which he saw in the heavenly battlefields where he was forced to fight.  This film is very heartfelt, and its poignancy is all the more unmistakeable because of the selfish, survival-oriented, 'social' setting in which it is placed.  It also contains a romance of the central character, bringing to the viewer an understanding of the humanity of the 'andoids', and an identification with their plight, as the central character finds himslef to be an android, and needs must flee his human pursuers with his android mate, in order to survive for however long he has been genetically programmed to.<br />A 'tip' for 'genetic' 'creators'/Capitalists/abusers: If you want to abuse ORGANIC material, do not make it look human!  Or, REALLY, DIE!
B000001EAQ|4.0|With POP, U2 has once again left its roots behind (read: stuff from Joshua Tree). However this is not a bad thing. Although POP, along with ZOOROPA, is not a masterpiece by any means, the album and its techno sound clearly is the work of the great band from Dublin. Even if you don't typically listen to the European style of music featured on this album, it is clear that U2 still knows what they are doing. A must for any U2 fan. As for the casual listener, &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot;  are treats even if you haven't heard much of the diverse material from this great quartet.
0060930187|4.0|This is an easy book to read, however, it can be very confusing when Esther becomes completely insane. This is the reason I give The Bell Jar only a 4 star rating. While reading this book, one questions whether or not Esther is truly insane. I began to rationalize her thoughts and was pulled into her world.  Are you living in a bell jar?
B000001IPL|5.0|The Offspring's third album, 'Smash,' is not your typical punk record. It may have the usual elements a punk record has, but it is all mixed together in a different way. 'Smash' is a brillaint record in all forms. The aggravated assault Dexter tells us all about shakes and shatters any person's soul, and Noodles's guitar licks are shattering and extremely powerful. With the lead track's hooky catchy beat, \\"Nitro (Youth Energy),\\" is a nicely written song with an awfully flavorful appeal. As well as the rest of the 13 other songs, except for the downside of the record, the song \\"So Alone,\\" the weakest sounding of them all. But with the awesome anthem of the title-track, the album finishes off magnificently. The hit singles (\\"Self Esteem,\\" \\"Come Out & Play,\\" and \\"Gotta Get Away\\") are, of course, all great, too, but there are numerous other awesome tracks on here. \\"Genocide\\" is highly aggressive, \\"Not The One\\" gives the finger to the adult world, \\"Killboy Powerhead\\" takes a nice look at relationships in a punk-like way and \\"Bad Habit,\\" gives a few tips on how to take care of bad drivers...by using the legendary art of road rage. All the songs pretty much talk about the same subject matter (politics, parents, depression, paranoia...y'know, the same old stuff you'd find on any punk album), but it doesn't make a difference because they're all great. Beware that all the tracks are pretty much identical, but will you care? Definetly not. This is one album that might sound all the same to you, but it won't let you down. The Offspring give this album a taste all of its own, which makes 'Smash' a treat to listen to, over and over again, day after day. (Also highly recommended is the Offspring's second album, 'Ignition,' whcih is a lot like 'Smash,' but a bit heavier.)
B000059ZLH|5.0|With all of the delays and stuff ups prior to the release, I was expecting bad audio sync and various other problems. I have heard a bad live recording of James before and expected the same vocal quality aswell. <br />The Truth is however that this DVD was as complete shock. I first listened to the entire DVD through and at the exact moment 'Dance Of Eternity' finished I was blown away. If your into DT and liked SFaM Get it NOW!!! There are also visual queues to the Story line that fit in very well and make the whole story a lot more interesting.<br />Total Sensory Overload!!.
B00000DFRS|4.0|This cd arrived after 8 long years since her last studio album, &quot;Im Your Baby Tonight&quot;. Afterwards Whitney went on to act in some movies, this was her celebrated return. My Love Is Your Love is a collection of contemporary R&amp;B music. Working with producers such as Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, David Foster, Missy Elliott, to name a few, Whitney turns in some exciting music with this album. Diane Warren penned a few of the tracks too.<br />The first single &quot;When You Believe&quot; is a duet with Mariah Carey, which I found to be underrated. The next single &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; performed better on the charts, a song with Kelly Price and Faith Evans, one of the most compelling R&amp;B tracks with true emotion that has been missing from the genre for quite some time. &quot;It's Not Right But It's Okay&quot; is a good song, but the remix on radio and in the video is much better than the one that appears in this album. &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; is a beautiful song written by Wyclef Jean which is truly a highlight of the album.<br />Along with the singles, there is definately some excitement to talk about. &quot;You'll Never Stand Alone&quot; is Whitney's most compelling and beautiful ballads since 1996's &quot;You Were Loved&quot;, truly inspiring. &quot;Until You Come Back&quot; is a classic Whitney ballad. &quot;In My Business&quot; is a song where Whitney wonders why people are all hatin her and up in her business, with Missy on the side to add extra flava. <br />Overall Whitney has turned in a fairly good collection of contemporary R&amp;B. Some would say she jumped on the bandwagon, but listening to this clearly showcases her ability to do various types of music.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|I went to see this movie at the insistance of my wife.  After the first 1/2 hour SHE wanted to walk out and I suggested that we give it some more time.  We stayed for over an hour but couldn't take the torture one more minute.  This is the FIRST movie either of us has ever walked out of.  I must add that the first movie I ever attended was in 1949!  So between us we have over 100 years of movie-going history to refer to and we've seen some doozies!<br />What a waste of talent (?), costuming and raw film.  There was no story to follow and the acting was horrendous.<br />If there were a minus 5 star category, this film would be it.
B000002VMD|5.0|In all honesty the only reason to buy this album is for the songs sung by Whitney Houston. This was Whitney's first movie and she's actually quite good, but nothing is better than her voice. These songs are classic and forever will be remembered by fans and admirers. &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; is a cover of the Dolly Parton hit from 1974 and 1982. Classic song for Whitney right there, with beautiful vocals and an outpouring of emotion. &quot;Run To You&quot; is equally compelling, the emotional depth of Whitney's ballads is incredible. Same goes for &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, another classic. Some of Whitney's best songs came from this soundtrack. &quot;Queen of the Night&quot; is a fun, early 90's dance song. &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; is Whitney's take of the Chaka Kahn hit. &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; is an excellent gospel song, made for the soundtrack (it wasn't in the movie). Overall these are six classic songs by Whitney which makes this a must buy for fans or anyone who enjoyed the music of The Bodyguard.
B00000JJQK|5.0|I was never a Beach Boys fan but when I saw the list of greatest albums and it was in the top five I said okay I'll take a listen.   I'm still hearing the harmonies in my head.  For someone who likes great melodies, harmonies, and lyrics this album is for you.  P.S. I am 40 and my favorite bands are the Clash, Beatles, and Elvis Costello.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Congratulations, ..., you can pick up your check and backstage passes, your career as a flack is fully intact. Folks, don't believe the hype on this one. I've been a fan of Depeche for years, and if you buy this CD expecting an up tempo, synth pop, i.e. fun album, like Black Celebration, People are People and Violator - Dream On. With the exception of the first two singles - Dream On and I Feel Loved, Exciter is boring, boring, boring. Lyrically it's as weak as anything they've done - I defy anyone to listen to Breathe without laughing. And Dead of Night? I thought that Rage Against the Machine experiment we had with Songs of Faith and Devotion was over. It seems that in their attempts to remain \\"relevant\\" Depeche has completely abandoned the sound that helped build such a loyal following.
B000007ODL|5.0|If you love the music of J. J. Cale then don't even hesitate to pick up a copy if you're lucky enough to find it.  When you hear the great hits others have covered from the Master that wrote and performed them first you'll truly appreciate what a true and original talent J. J. is.  Five stars says it all.
B000003S5H|4.0|How difficult is it to make a seventies-synthesizer easy-listening album sound fresh? This French duo makes it sound all so simple, though in reality it's an admirable feat. <br />Lush textures create dreamy atmospheres, which are all very pleasing to the ear. The inspiration is woven throughout the album. Many people call this a must-have, and I am inclined to agree, though I must wait to see if it is an album that can create a lasting impression.
B00005B4GU|5.0|While many people and especially hardcore fans will find that the music on this album takes a lot of getting used to, I'm thrilled that these guys have the guts to really move ahead, in spite of what everybody expects from them. <br />When I listened to this album the first time, I sometimes thought, &quot;they're making fools of all listeners by just doing crazy&quot;, but at second listen I realized they are talking serious business here. Or anti-business, if you want. Though rather somber, even fatalistic at parts, the album has an unbelievable emotional depth which is very, very impressive. I truly hope that more rock bands will try to explore these new exciting musical ways instead of further spoiling our already very much spoilt ears.
B000002GGO|5.0|Like all the other reviewers (who have such good music taste I might add!) I completely agree that this is one of the best albums of the 80's. This is passionate, urgent rock n' roll. When Jim Kerr sings 'just my imagination...' in 'Speed Your Love To Me' it gives me shivers. Also, the keyboard textures and musical backdrop to 'Up On The Catwalk' give this song an urgency and passion which makes me want to hear it again and again (I love the name checks in this one). Other classics include 'Waterfront', 'C Moon Cry Like A Baby' and 'East At Easter' - in fact the whole album is brilliant. 'Sparkle In The Rain' was released in the same year as U2's 'The Unforgettable Fire' and you can hear how much Simple Minds influenced U2's sound and production. This is the Simple Minds album to seek out as a bridge between the New Wave/synth textures of 'New Gold Dream' and the more straight ahead rock of 'Once Upon A Time'. Also highly recommended is '89's 'Street Fighting Years' and the recent 'Neapolis'.  You won't be disappointed with 'Sparkle In The Rain' - like a previous reviewer I also agree it's one of the Top 25 '80's albums. Simple Minds are a very underrated rock group and you should not miss out on this one.
B0000399WI|5.0|yes that is just a step better than phenominal.  Original story written by Stephen King.  The screenplay was adapted and I think directed by the same man who did Stephen King's The Green Mile.  This DVD has very little in the way of extra features but it is the DVD I watched the most.  Tim Robbins acting and Morgan Freeman's narrating is unmatched.  Go see it already.     D.Cox
B00004YW6I|5.0|This record is flat-out one of the best of the year.  Every track is a powerfully composed, synthetic piece of art that washes over you with visceral force.  Even better, this is the sort of music that works all the time--it's great for falling asleep or for a party.  Textured, brilliant, music that is different from almost anything else.  Driving rhythms matched to melodic electronics and Harvey's drowning voice.  Fantastic.
B000002HMH|5.0|Metallica take a big step forward, a progressive step that leaves a lot of whining fans behind, they show maturity on this album and their ability to diversify and for the Metallica fans of old tracks like 'Bleeding Me' might just be enough to keep you happy.<br />This album has a much fuller sound than their previous and is incredible as a result, don't be out off by what you've heard or your opinion of the band, just buy it, you won't regret it!
0060975768|5.0|This is not an easy book to read.  That isn't a statement on the writing style or the way the book is organized.  I found this a difficult book to read because of its content.  Several times, more than I could count, I stopped reading and found myself staring off into space as the impact of what I had just read was beginning to sink in.  Bravery and nobility, even in the face of such horror and violence, all in a day's work.  I was humbled by the almost nonchalant way in which these men spoke about their role in the battles at LZ X-ray and Albany. I have't cried in reading a book in a long time but I could not hold back tears when reading the chapter at the end in which the wives and children back in the States told their own tales of how the battle impacted their lives.  This book made me feel so very proud of all of our men and women who went to Vietnam, fought for our country, risked everything, and in far too many cases, never came back home.
B000002H72|5.0|the pixies are my all time favorite band, and out of their albums, this is the greatest.  if you have never heard them before, start here.  you won't regret it.  although my fave song isn't on here (isla de encanta), debaser, broken face, and, of course, gigantic are all songs worthy of listening to repeatedly.  so, check out the pixies.  they rock.
B00004T37H|5.0|I thought that this movie was great movie.  I loved the story and the developmant of the charaters.  The animation is also wonderful.  It may not be sutible for young kids, it does get pretty violent in parts and it may disturb some children, but all in all it was a good movie.  I think if you enjoy anime and want to watch a good moive, then you should try this one. Enjoy!
B000059RL3|5.0|A man whose music will inspire generations forever. From the start the ever popular Whats goin on flows through you and I like at the end &quot;get the football out&quot; you hear in the backsground. Other favorites are Right on which flows ever so perfectly. What's Happenning brother is another favorite. This album shows the variety of skills from the soul of a &quot;Troubled man&quot;
B00003CXFV|5.0|This was one of the best movies I ever rented. Good story, good acting... Rent it today
B00003Q43A|1.0|I've never understood the success of the movie. It has no script and nothing that approaches the storytelling elements of the great special effects films of a Speilberg or Lucas.
B00005LB9O|4.0|On the Invisible band Travis takes a slight musical detour from the Man Who.  Travis does not go electronic or anything but they do get a lot happier and upbeat.  Bad thing or Good thing?  Well a little of both,  There upbeat approach does produce some great songs such as &quot;sing,&quot; &quot;side&quot; and &quot;flowers in the window,&quot; However it also produced the campy and not very good &quot;Follow the Light&quot; (I tried to like it).  As for the slower songs they just don't stack up to their Man Who counterparts.  I'm speaking generally because there are songs on Invisible Band like, the intrestingly titled, &quot;humpty dumpty love song&quot; and &quot;the Cage&quot; which are very good.  But the songs &quot;Dear Diary&quot; &quot;Last Train&quot; and &quot;Safe&quot; lack the melody and choruses that make the tracks on Man Who a little better.  Basically a great album and a must have for Travis fans, just not exactly Man Who.
B000002HK4|5.0|This is basically two EPs pressed onto one CD. The first is a strangely moving epic consisting of seven distinct pieces (four songs, three instrumentals) that have been seamlessly spliced together in a single 23-minute track. Like all great music, it grows on you with repeated listening.  The second EP is a collection of live covers. If you're a DT fan, they offer fascinating insights into the band's various musical influences. If this is your first DT album, you'll like the covers about as much or little as the originals which they stick VERY closely to, both musically and soundwise. (More such live covers circulate on the 'net as MP3 files, with the band apparently turning a blind eye.)
B000002L9M|5.0|This album is completely amazing and I even fell asleep listening to it last night, waking up half-strangled by my headphones!!<br />This is my first and only Depeche Mode album that I've bought and I have to say that I believe it a masterpiece.  Many people find it as a very gothic and depressive album, but I find it comforting.  Gahan's voice is soothing and reassuring and the music is calming.<br />&quot;Stripped&quot; is completely amazing and thought-inducing and is my favorite.  In fact, &quot;Stripped&quot; was covered by Rammstein (German techno-rock group known for &quot;Du Hast&quot;) on what I believe is their latest album, which goes to show that this album and that particular song have had a great influence on today's artists.<br />With Gahan's warm-baritone voice and Gore's tender lyrics &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; becomes a close second.<br />I must recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the expiremental artists of the 80's and the &quot;technoists&quot; :o) of today, but als to those who like the British 80's group Tears for Fears because even though they have a much different musical style I believe that they sing about very similar things.<br />Depeche Mode are brilliant and I believe with their new album, &quot;Exciter&quot;, that they won't let us &quot;DMers&quot; down.
B00003CX97|5.0|There is probably not a film of human drama that compares to this.  If you haven't seen it, then you must...if you don't own it, you should.  A film about stout hearts and courage, honor and especially pride, this is a must see!

0156528207|3.0|This book was kind of strange, and I didn't really understand it at first.  Later in the book, though, I realized that it was about grownups, and how they are always so busy with life, and they never really sit back and enjoy it, and see it from a child's perspective.  Figuring out the message was more fun than reading the book, though.
0452282152|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Tracy Chevalier's book, &quot;Girl with the Pearl Earring.&quot; I knew nothing about Vermeer prior to reading this book. I didn't even recognize the painting on the cover of the book - however, my book club chose to read this as their selection for May, and I wanted to keep up with them. <br />    &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; is descriptive and moving, and Chevalier does a fabulous job of catching and describing the feelings and demonstrating the emotions that Griet has in having to leave her close-knit Protestant family to live with the famed painter Vermeer and his Catholic family in 17th century Delft. To imagine what it was like for a 16 year old girl to leave the comfort of her own home and abandon her relationships with her family is overwhelming. Chevalier does a wonderful job of showing the internal conflict that Griet is having throughout the book. She is torn between doing her job and what she feels is best for her relationships with those she loves.<br />    This book is not long at all, and it reads quickly, as you are captivated and drawn into Griet's life and relationships with the butcher's son, her brother, and her ill-fated little sister. This book is filled with tragedy as well as triumph, and makes me wonder about the story behind all those paintings I've come to take for granted.
0792843835|5.0|...was absolutely delighted with this funny, charming  and completely entertaining movie.  Each performance was perfect, from cafe owner Brenda's belligerent attitude to Jasmine's quiet demeanor, to the tattoo artist's contempt for harmony, each and every character in Bagdad Cafe lends to the overall charm of this wide spot in the road where these diverse personalities all work off of each other. Jasmine's ability to make the best of a bad situatiuon and bring some magic to the cafe/gas station/motel in the middle of nowhere is the spark that gives life to the desolation seen in every direction. Individual performances including Jack Palance as the resident artist make Bagdad Cafe one of the finest movies in my collection.
6305776326|5.0|Poor Mary Katherine Gallagher!  She's the most unpopular girl at St Monica's school, she's a klutz and has a habit of kissing trees and stop signs.  But, she's a SUPERSTAR!<br />Molly Shannon (NEVER BEEN KISSED) takes her beloved &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; character to the big screen in this cute, hilarious comedy.<br />When Catholic Teen Magazine sponsors a talent contest at St Monica's, Mary Katherine feels sure that she will win, and get to kiss super-dancer school stud Skye Corrigan (Will Ferrell).  However, there's Skye's bulemic girlfriend Evian (Elaine Hendrix - THE PARENT TRAP, ROMY &amp; MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION) to deal with, and the rest of the A-group.<br />But when Mary is put into Special Education after an incident with Evian, it seems her SUPERSTAR dreams might never come true...<br />A fantastic, big-hearted comedy.  It's a real winner, despite receiving less-than-thrilling reviews.  I really love it, and Shannon is a comedy legend.<br />Also starring Glynis Johns (MARY POPPINS, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING), Harland Williams and Mark McKinney.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out because of the hit single &quot;Higher&quot;. From the moment I watched the video on MTV, I became their fan. Then I started hearing the song over &amp; over on local radio stations, until they announced it on radio that Human Clay will be in stores on August 26, so I went that day &amp; bought it...I still listen to it everyday. I also bought the instrumental CD so that I can play the songs on my guitar &amp; drums, so far I got 6 of the songs down packed on the drums!!! Go buy this album for those who haven't, it's a great one, &amp; the concerts are even better!!!!!!!!!! (I went to their Mars Music Amphitheater concert in florida!)<br />Susy.
6304297912|5.0|Have to say, they don't get much better!  I won't go into the details of the movie, as you can read all that above. Trainspotting is dark, disturbing, and absolutely hilarious! See the movie in the right frame of mind.  The scene I feel almost stole the movie apparantly no one else finds as great-Rent and the Opium suppositories-laugh ...  every time I see it! Worth purchasing, may need to watch it a few times to catch all the little things.
0790749815|5.0|When you think of the mystery and the suspense this movie creates in a time well before computer special effects, Hitchcock was able to keep you on the edge of your seat in a way few movies can. Add to that, a before its time sexual tension and somewhat forward and flirtatious relationship (done very tastefully)and this is a must own movie!
B00005B36H|5.0|I wasn't going to write a review; heck, there are hundreds already. But the people saying it doesn't live up to Ænima in part because Eon Blue, Mantra, and Faaip De Oiad aren't real tracks, meaning that there are only ten &quot;real songs&quot; on the disc are having some proplems with basic math--and they're annoying me to no end. Have they listened to Ænima lately? That album has 6 non-musical tracks! (i.e. Useful Idiot, Harry Manback, Intermission, Satan--instruments and vocals, yes, but like Faaip--Cesaro, and (-)) Meaning only nine &quot;real songs&quot;!<br />That all said, I think Ænima has a number of better songs, but Lateralus is a better compleate album.<br />Bah humbug! Buy it now!
B000002V1D|4.0|I've heard that the Wedding Album was the album that really began Duran Duran's comeback (as if they could ever go away), and I can definitely see why.  Along with the hits 'Ordinary World' and 'Come Undone', the Wedding Album has a lot of other great songs that have a bit more funk to them than past Duran work.  I fell in love with 'Too Much Information' instantly, and it's the perfect opening to the album.  'Love Voodoo' and 'None of the Above' are amazing songs, and I'm sad that they've never gotten onto their greatest hits albums.<br />If you're a Duran Duran fan, this album is a must for any Duran Duran collection.  I highly recommend it.
B00000K19E|4.0|Discussions of The Matrix manage to send sparks flying whenever a fan and a hater should happen to bring up the topic. So (assuming you've been living under a rock since '98) what exactly is this film that managed to spawn a devoted following and equally devoted detractors? (A phenomenon you can witness simply by viewing other customer's reviewes.)<br />It's the tale of Neo (Keanu Reeves), a young man leading, as the nefarious Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) says, \\"two lives.\\" By day he works for a respectable software company, by night he's a hacker, searching at his computer screen for answers to his question, and for the man he thinks can answer them. The man he seeks is Morpheus, a \\"terrorist\\" sometimes called the Most Dangerous Man Alive, and the question, the question that acts like a splinter in his mind, driving him mad, is: \\"What is the Matrix?\\"<br />He's soon contacted by a member of outlaw Morpheus's group of merry men, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who leads Neo to Morpheus, and thus to Neo's encounter with the truth about reality (undoubtedly one of the finest ... moments in Cinema). And so begins our entry into the wild, graphically intense, kung-fu filled alterverse envisioned by the Wachowski brothers.<br />The Matrix has \\"cool!\\" factor to spare. So many things, such as the learning of entire martial arts disciplines in seconds, the dodging of bullets, intense slow-mo battle scenes, flying across rooftops, and Federal Agents from Hell (led by the aforementioned Hugo Weaving, who proves to be the most indestructible sci-fi menace since Terminator 2's T1000) leave you on the edge of your seat, waiting for and wondering what the NEXT thing they'll throw at you will be.<br />The most interesting thing about the Matrix though, is the vast variation in people's interpretations of its meaning. I've heard The Matrix described as everything from a metaphor about the Welfare State to a rebellious rejection of social conformity, and beyond; references to everything from Greek Mythology to the Bible abound (Trinity, anyone?), and at its core the story is a rather obvious live-action anime-style retelling of the story of Christ. Don't let that turn you off though; even as an avowed atheist I greatly enjoyed it :)<br />Now to the weaknesses. The characters are rather underdeveloped, the acting not so spectacular, though Carrie-Anne Moss turns in an underrated performance as the strong-yet-vulnerable love interest. And Weaving is delightful as Agent Smith (can't mention him enough!)<br />There were some rather edit-room floor worthy sequences (personally I found the Oracle bit a little silly), and the whole bit towards the end regarding our hero's \\"Second Coming\\", was, well, contrived indeed. Luke Skywalker probably couldn't do that, and he had the Force with him! Also, after the first few viewings...well, this is more the type of movie you watch *scenes* of then actually watching the whole movie. Which belies its fundamental weakness; it DOES put style-before-substance, but with style to spare, and just enough substance, The Matrix manages to carve out a niche in the Pantheon of Good Sci-Fi, despite its weaknesses.<br />So, are the fans right about it being \\"THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!\\"? No. Are the critics right about it being an \\"Stylized MTV-generation piece of tripe\\"? No again. I could say that its a good, solid Sci-Fi/action flick, but that wouldn't do you any good. For as the Great Morpheus himself says: \\"You cannot be told what The Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.\\"
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have heard this year. I usually don't get this kind of music because i'm not into the metal/rap thing. But then I saw the music video for \\"Crawling\\" and I was blown away. Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda's voices really compliment each other. I mean usually you just have some guy screamin in your ear or trying to rap, but with Linkin Park you have some soul in the voice, some screaming, and some rapping. This album doesn't have any cussing, which is surprising cuz usually u hear [it] all the time.  I don't know why people compare this group to Limp because they sound nothing like them. They are waay better. The songs here are also very melodic...which is hard to find with bands like these. The lyrics are very in depth too.If you liked \\"Crawling\\" I feel that you will love this whole cd. Also a note, give the cd time, if you don't like all the songs the first time, listen to it again, so you can grow into it. =)Here is my song to song review:<br />1. Papercut- Great opening, I luv it when they sing \\"The sun goes down!\\" 5/5<br />2. One Step Closer- When the guy screams Shut Up like 5,000 times, that gets annoying. 4/5<br />3. With You- Great lyrics, very catchy. Good combination of rap and singing. 5/5<br />4. Point of Authority- Rage song, good tho. 5/5<br />5. Crawling- I'm sure ya'll heard this or u wouldn't be reading this? 5/5<br />6. Runaway- The title explains itself, its alrite. Kind of like Point of Authority, but it has a catchier chorus. 4/5.<br />7. By Myself- Another rage song, but I like this one, chorus is catchy. 5/5<br />8. In the End- I love this song. Chester and Mike's voices are really good!  5/5<br />9. A Place For My Head- I dunno why I like this song. 5/5<br />10. Forgotten- I start digging this song by the third verse, give it time. 5/5<br />11. Cure For The Itch- This is DJ Hahn's solo! Very good. 5/5<br />12. Pushing Me Away- Just as good as In The End. This shows off Chester Bennington's vocal ability besides screaming his head off. 5/5<br />JUST GET THE ALBUM!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator 2 stands as the best action/science-fiction ever put to film; and the DVD lives up to that high standard.<br />Terminator 2, the sequel (obviously) to James Cameron's landmark Terminator movie, takes that films atmosphere of terror, of hopeless and heroic struggle against murderous and unfeeling machines, and kicks it up several dozen notches. This time, our mechanized friend from the future(Arnold Schwarezenegger) is fighting for the good guys; fighting to protect humanity's one hope in the future in the War Against the Machines, John Connor (played by Edward Furlong) from quite possibly the coolest sci-fi villain ever created; the shape-shifting and seemingly unstoppable T1000 (Robert Patrick, now of X-Files fame.)<br />Since we last saw our merry band of apocalypse fighters, John's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has been locked up in the looney bin for professing her belief that a man from the future saved her life from a killer robot and impregnated her with her son. But when her now-estranged son realizes that her tale was more then an insane rant, and gets his hulking robotic friend to help break her out, the spectacular action gets going (and going, and going.)<br />The action sequences alone are worth owning the movie. Using revolutionary (especially for the time) special effects, Cameron creates an adrenaline-pumping thrillride that has yet to be matched in the intensity of its atmosphere (and holds its own special effects wise, even against new-comers such as The excellent-if-slightly over-rated Matrix).<br /> But there's more to this then great action; Linda Hamilton's performance as a fanatically militant mother with a clear vision of the dark future awaiting humanity is superb, and again, helped along by Cameron's strong visual style (the visuals from that &quot;Judgement Day&quot; dream never quite leave your head after you've seen it, even once!) And Edward Furlong's attempts to bond with his emotionally-incapacitated protector rangefrom comical to touching, and provide another emotional base upon which the film works to its dramatic, explosive conclusion. To top it all off, this DVD, to put it simply, rocks. The visual quality, audio quality, the features (6 HOURS of content!), my goodness. All I can say is that this is a DVD experience simply unmatched by anything else (especially since I had the fortunate benefit of watching it on a 43&quot; Sony Projection TV with 5.1 Surround Sound!)<br />Whatever Cameron-less machinations (pun-intended) might be undertaken with the future of this franchise, this flick stands as a towering achievement of high-octane, action-packed, smart sci-fi.
B000002KHH|5.0|I am listening to the CD as I write this, and the song is Hand of Doom. Led Zeppelin were great, and they have been cited as the pioneering metal masters, and that is fine with me. This CD is my fave metal CD ever, along with some works of Iron Maiden. I first bought the casette in '88 and now own the CD. This CD has not dated. A fine piece of work from War Pigs to Iron Man to Fairies wear boots. My personal faves are Paranoid and the ultra-heavy Electric Funeral. Ozzy, Tony, Terry [Geezer] and Bill ROCK here. Very fun to listen to. This is the only Sabbath CD I own, and for me it's good enough and worth it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Thousands of flaming arrows dancing across the sky. Dangerous and gory swordfights against man and beast inside a splendidly recreated Colliseum, itself inside a Rome brought back to the old grandeur of the Empire, pomp and pageantry and cheering Colliseum-goers and all. These are just a few of the arresting images to be found within Gladiator, the epic story of Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe), a man whose incorrigible integrity and honesty display themselves at the wrong place and time, namely stepping on the toes of soon-to-be-Emperor Commodus's (Joaquin Phoenix) ascension to power. Set to be executed, Maximus manages to escape, only to be captured again, this time sold into slavery. Fighting his way up the ranks so to speak, he fights for a chance to enter the Colliseum, and strike back at Commodus, for vengeance, for honor, and for Rome.<br />Sound like the stuff of epics? It is indeed. Some have chided its simple storyline, forgetting that a movie with a simple storyline, if it's well-acted (Phoenix's Commodus was especially good, just the perfect combination of whiny dependence and power-mad incestous insanity necessary to create a believable, and quite hateable villain) , well-directed (by the brilliant Ridley Scott), and well-scored (by Hans Zimmer, currently of Pearl Harbor fame), is a good movie nonetheless.<br />Some have chided its historical inaccuracies, forgetting that the intent here was not to make a History Channel documentary. And this is not an attack on History Channel documentaries (they really ARE fascinating). But Scott's intent was obviously not to make such. His intent here was to tell a rousing, romantic, one might say &quot;old-school&quot; epic of a hero fighting for love, honor, and country. And at that he succeeds splendidly. So if you can overlook the historical inaccuracies, and the relatively simple storyline, be prepared for an unabashedly heroic film done with all the splendor Hollywood can muster. And hopefully you too willjoin the cheering of the countless Gladiator fans shouting &quot;Maximus! Maximus!&quot;<br />A sidenote: the DVD version is wonderful. Two discs, one with the movie (done with excellent visual quality, especially when viewed on a quality widescreen), one with fascinating extra features on the making of the movie, and the history of the Gladiatorial games, make this a package worth owning.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I saw the movie, and although it was a bit hard to understand at first, by the time it was halfway through I knew that I would be getting the CD.  I'm a big musical freak and this one is on the top of my list.  I absolutely loved some of the songs like &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot;, &quot;Come What May&quot;, &quot;Elephant Love Melody&quot;, and &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;.  However, there were a few songs on there that I don't remember hearing in the movie and not really liking too much.  These include &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;, and the last song on the disk, &quot;Nature Boy&quot;.  They have some impressive sound effects, but if they're not in the movie why put them in there?  Plus &quot;Nature Boy&quot; was already on there, the way it basically was in the movie (different singer), so why put it on there again?  Why not put another song from the movie on there that I know all of the fans would like to hear?  That was a little disappointing, but then again these songs probably have to go through many people for clearance so that it can go on the CD, and some weren't allowed on because of copyright issues.  However, if they don't come out with another Moulin Rouge CD with the songs that they missed and that everyone wished were on there, there will probably be many disappointed fans.
0385501560|3.0|I have read all of Palahniuk's previous books and was looking forward to the release of Choke. However, I was a little disappointed when I read it. Is worth the read but definitely not one of his best books. Hopefully the next one will be better.
B000002UA2|5.0|Obscured By Clouds is the soundtrack album to another obscure and long forgotten film, The Valley.  But unlike the film, the album contains more great Pink Floyd work.  The band was really hitting their stride on the album.  The title track is a spacey instrumental while then dive into a folky sound on the great &quot;Wot's...Uh The Deal&quot;.  &quot;Absolutely Curtains&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot;, &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; and &quot;Childhood's End&quot; are all strong cuts.  The album set the stage for their major breakthrough in the US, the ubiquitous Dark Side Of The Moon.  In fact, Obscured By Clouds sounds quite a bit like it's follow up and you can hear the trail the band was blazing with this album.
0062502182|5.0|Before i read this book, i was all over the place. I had no idea what i wanted to do with my life or where it was going. It was almost as if time had ceased for me and life was just happening all around to everyone else. When i completed it, i realized a lot of the things that were preventing me from moving forward. I think of Santiago and his adventures every time that same feeling makes its way back into my brain. It reminds me to be patient and stick it out. The Alchemist has changed the way i view life. I recommend it to anyone who needs a little push to get things started for themselves--and also to those who just want to read a wonderful story. Enjoy.    :O)
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother finds Pink Floyd finally coming into their own on their best album since their debut, The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.  That album was really Syd Barrett's and following his departure, the band struggled a bit.  But on Atom Heart Mother, Roger Waters' vision was realized.  &quot;Atom Heart Mother Suite&quot; is a brilliant track that is grandiose in nature, but perfectly performed by the band.  They swing through styles in almost a jazz like fashion and the individual sections, especially &quot;Funky Dung&quot;, could stand out on their own.  &quot;If&quot; has a softer sound while &quot;Summer '68&quot; has some great lyrics.  &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; shows that David Gilmour's talents as both singer and guitarist.  &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; is another great song suite.  Atom Heart Mother was a big hit in England as it became the band's first number one album.  The album also faired quite well in the US and help set the stage for their future success.
0812550706|5.0|ENDER'S GAME was a novel that will surely capture the minds of every one of its reader's.  From the beginning Card is able to establish a setting which keeps the audience in constant suspense. Based on the rough life of a boy prodigy named Ender who is chosen to save the world.  He is put through a series of training exercises along with several other young military geniuses.  One of the most captivating of these exercises or games is the battleroom.  Here is where the most important skills of military tactics are discovered. Card's masterpiece of a novel could please any reader.  It is highly recommended to people of all ages but mostly to the teenage reader.
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd followed up the brilliant Atom Heart Mother with another top notch effort, Meddle.  The album opens up with the hard driving &quot;One Of These Days&quot; that has been a concert favorite for years.  They slow things down on the smooth &quot;A Pillow Of Winds&quot;.  &quot;Fearless&quot; is also a slower number, &quot;San Tropez&quot; lives up to its name with a light, breezy sound and &quot;Seamus&quot; has a bluesy sound with some good guitar work.  The album's closer is the epic, 20 plus minute &quot;Echoes&quot;.  The song has a futuristic, science fiction sound that dips and dives and is a stunning song.  Meddle is another great piece to the band's great 70's work.
6305657939|1.0|Someone had the gall to market this drivel as mature and intelligent.  That egregious misconception is based on an inability to distinguish between wealth and brains.  Very few movies I've seen rival this one for emptiness and pointlessness, and the final scene is astonishingly stupid.  &quot;Are they kidding?&quot; I said to myself when I saw it.  I may even have said it aloud.  Do not buy or rent this film.  Every dollar that goes to its makers is a slap in the face to what's left of our culture.
B000002UA5|4.0|Ummagumma is a part live and part studio album.  The album opens up with fine live performances of &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot;, &quot;A Saucerful Of Secrets&quot; and especially an early Floyd live staple, the crazy and great &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot;.  The studio section gives each band member a chance to contribute a song.  Richard Wright provides the strong &quot;Sysyphus&quot; while Roger Waters shows some flashes of greatness on &quot;Grantchester Meadow&quot;.  David Gilmour's &quot;Narrow Way&quot; is the best of the studio work and he plays some great acoustic guitar.  Nick Mason's &quot;Grand Vizier Garden Party&quot; is far and away the weakest studio effort.
B00003CWL6|4.0|This film is very intriguing. IT's story is very creative, and it gives you something to think about... maybe we should all look a little closer. Kevin Spacey is a stand out as his character goes from a dumpy little guy to a bad mamma jamma. <br />The DVD goodies are pretty good. It's got a little montage of stuff about the road to the oscars, and all that. The comentary is informing. Get the movie already.
B000002AGY|5.0|I owned the LP of this and now own the CD. This group of all-stars led by Jim Hall with arrangements by Don Sebesky play so beautiful and moving that it is hard to imagine being without this recording. The centerpiece is of course &quot;Concierto.&quot; It is impossible to fully describe the inter-play and virtuosity displayed on this piece. One of the most thrilling moments in music for me is Paul Desmond's entrance into this piece. If you can't hear that moment without feeling so totally happy that you are alive and able to enjoy such sublime sounds, then check your pulse because you are probably not among the living anymore.
6304602979|5.0|If you're choosing between DVD's and VHS, it won't really matter which you get because this DVD isn't all that loaded with goodies. THey could have at least included some deleted scenes. There were some that I know of, but won't mention them becasue it'll ruin how the movie ends and all. <br />The reason I gave this movie a five, despite the lackluster DVD, is because this movie is so darn good. Strait down to the soundtrack. Some of the best dialogue ever is in this film. Tarintino writes in an almost Shakespearean (Is that even close to the proper spelling?) in nature. The performances are dead on. Like Gary Oldman who plays a white pimp that talks strait out the ghetto. You should watch him in this and then watch him in the Conteneder... good lord he's good. THen there is the infamous dialogue between Dennis Hopper and Chris Walken. That was one of the most perfect scenes in the history of perfect scenes. The film as a whole isn't sugarcoated which is why I think it's a much better Romance than anything else. Buy this movie...Better yet, Buy it right here on Amazon.com. It'll come strait to your house, ain't that cool.
B0000542DG|4.0|Okay, I'll be the first to admit it: Final Destination isn't going to win any Academy awards. There is no amazing acting, directing, or musical score that'll make this worthy of winning best picture. But why are we always looking for the next classic? Can't we just watch a summer movie every so often and enjoy it for what it is...just fun? I seem to think we can't. From what I see, movies such as 'Final Destination' are being mocked for their lack of &quot;Oscar-winning material&quot;. So if you're looking for the next Titanic or Saving Private Ryan, don't watch this movie, because you're not going to find it...this is what you will find:<br />1.) This is a very intense, frightening movie. At only one hour and thirty minutes long, its quick, fun, and overall a joy to watch. 2.) The plot is scary, and the death scenes will make you shiver...basically it's lots of fun.  3.) The acting might not be top-notch, but it's good enough that you don't laugh at it like other dumb horror movies made today, and that says a lot.<br />We all expected 'Pearl Harbor' to be a gem, and what did we get? A half-decent movie that didn't do nearly as well as what we thought it would...so watch 'Final Destination', but watch it with an attitude that you're watching a fun summer movie, nothing more, nothing less, and you'll enjoy it.
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all, I really love the packaging of this CD. It's very different than anything else I've seen. It's a black sleeve which is covering a unique booklet. I won't give away that part. I'm about to review every song on this CD. There is 13 tracks, but it can be cut down to 8 songs (Tracks 2,4,10,and 13 are interludes, and tracks 6 and 7 are two songs put together).<br />1. The Grudge - 10/10 - A superb opener. Very interesting lyrics, it has it's heavy parts and it's soft parts.<br />2. The Patient - 8.5/10 - Great music, but the lyrics are extremely bizarre, and don't make sense.<br />3. Schism - 9.5/10 - First single, great video, great lyrics, great song. One of the best song<br />4. Parabol/Parabola - 10+/10 - THE BEST SONG ON THIS CD. Very cool music and lyrics, almost too good to be true.<br />5. Ticks &amp; Leeches - 7.5/10 - One of the weaker tracks, but it's OK. You can skip this track if you're in a hurry.<br />6. Lateralis - 9/10 - Another strong track, a little long, but that's OK.<br />7. Reflection - 6/10 - The weakest track. Too long, too uninteresting.<br />8. Triad - 9/10 - Good way to end the CD.<br />I strongly reccomend this CD.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|..heard a d.j. once say after playing dust in the wind...&quot;wow, that's like uh,that's like, uh, uh, philosophy&quot;....yeah, he was right...in the bizarro world....philosophy - philo-love of....sophy-knowledge...yeah...i get his point...i agree with my friend from Simi Valley....&quot;When Push comes to Shove...the Shoved get going&quot;...play this one loud....play it often...and hope that the same event that flattened Siberia in the early part of the 20th Century (the famous Tunguska Event)strikes your hometown before you get to Carry on Wayward Son.
B00000AFFF|5.0|Well, this is my 'second' time around in trying to review this amazing disc...and I'll keep it up until I get it right! This is simply one of those cd's that I can't quite get a handle on when it comes to talking about it. Perhaps it cut's too deep...I'm not quite sure but I do know that listening to &quot;Painted From Memory&quot; forces me to look into myself, at times with an unbearable reality. Oh well, while it sounds a cliche this album really does defy catagorization and trying to explain it's contents, whatever adjectives I may use, will simply fall far short of the beauty that these songs hold. But, since hope springs eternal, here we go again!                                                  <br />This is a disc that, if you truly enjoy 'adult' music, and by that I mean music that indulges in wonderful, sophisticated melodies, mature lyrics and unforgettable chemistry between two artists than prepare to pick up your copy of &quot;Painted From Memory&quot; . Right from the outset with &quot;In The Darkest Place&quot; Burt and Elvis set the mood for a cd filled with heartache, regret, sadness and not just a little remorse as well. Looking back not exactly a 'fun' cd to throw on at parties but....you'd be wrong! Between Burt's still amazing gift with a melody and Elvis' ascerbic lyrics this disc can, and should, be enjoyed whatever you may be doing. The problem being though that you will soon find yourself stopping in the midst of whatever you were in the middle of and eventually finding yourself sitting down to listen much more intently to Elvis's tragic but at all times honest lyrics.                                                         <br />It never ceases to amaze me at the power that music holds when done, as in this case, exceedingly well. From &quot;My Thief&quot; to &quot;Painted From Memory&quot; and &quot;The Sweetest Punch&quot; to the awe inspiring finale &quot;God Give Me Strength&quot;  Elvis and Burt consistantly paint pictures of relationships that have, for various reasons, fallen apart and left one or perhaps both parties hurt, confused and ultimately abandoned. My first few listens I honestly kept wondering how they were aware of 'my' feelings when watching a lover walk out of your life....for the last time. Bogart actually said it best in Casablanca, &quot;....standing there with a stupid look on my face feeling like someone just kicked me in the gut!&quot;  But perhaps that is, in essence, what makes for a true masterpiece such as this. The artists not only understand your feelings so well but are also able to convey those emotions for you. And in the case of &quot;Painted From Memory&quot; Elvis and Burt have done just that.... countless times over! Who thought that a broken heart could feel so good.                                <br />Ultimately, this cd demands quite a bit from the listener. These are not just songs that 'paint' pretty pictures about love and everything that comes after. Elvis and Burt are two composers who have so much to say, not just in an incredible lyric but also in a passage where words simply aren't necessary. And that, my friends, is what makes this cd so powerful. A disc to put on with a glass of wine and an open wound.
B00004XQP4|5.0|If you loved Green Day before, you won't be disappointed--they have that same pop-punk sound. I usually listen to pure pop groups like 'N Sync, but I really liked a lot of Green Day's songs. The lyrics are great, and the songs are filled with catchy beats.<br />Best Song: Misery
B00000AFFF|5.0|Well, for starters I certainly cannot add much to what has already been written concerning &quot;Painted From Memory.&quot; If given the chance I'd gladly award this disc SIX stars...simply on the merits of Elvis Costaello's beautiful and at times tragic lyrics. Though at times he does tend to be slightly too clever (sans review title), it hardly affects the gorgeous melodies and the mature outlook that this cd reveals with just one listen! It's very difficult indeed to find &quot;Pop&quot; music that carries this much ingenuity and beauty while at the same time maintaining a certain amount of worldweariness about it. I know of no one who at some point, while dealing with a broken heart, hasn't felt the very same emotions that Elvis so vividly describes. Whoever suspected that a broken heart could feel so good...yet hurt so bad! Thank you Burt Bacharach and Elvis... a great disc to put on with a glass of wine and an open wound.
B00004X01U|5.0|The mother of reinvention has done it again. This time Madonna has taken on a sound straight off the '70s funk record. And as expected, the new stuff is 100% fun! Expect an even more electronic, gutsier sound than you heard on her last record, Ray of Light. Groove to the futuristic dance beats in &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; and the dreamy eletro-funk of &quot;Nobody's Perfect.&quot;<br />Best Song: &quot;What It Feels Like For a Girl
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge is spectacular! Without question, one of the most entertaining movies in years with surprising performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  If the characterizations are a bit thin, the incredible energy of this movie more than compensates.  The anachronistic music, rather than detracting as some reviewers have claimed, is one of the more amusing aspects. Moulin Rouge is a gluttonous smorgasbord for the senses-colorful and raucous with bearly a moment to relax.  Kidman is deliciously manipulative, McGregor is perfect as the breathless innocent playwright, and the supporting cast fills in the slower moments.  Moulin Rouge may set the standard for a new breed of movie musical, and if it does, it will take its place not just as great entertainment, but also as a great film.
B0000060NF|5.0|I don't know if I could pick one album to be the clear best, but &quot;What's Going On&quot; is definitely a strong contender. Everything about this album is spectacular. The lyrics are always inspiring and beautiful, and the vocals are wonderful throughout the entire album. Also, the production is incredible, with dense layers of instruments, vocals, and percussion making for a symphonic blend that's so deep you hear new things every time you listen.<br />With all parts of the album combining into a wonderful whole, it's no surprise the album is so addictive. It can be listened to daily, over and over again, and never once wears out its welcome. &quot;What's Going On&quot; is a masterpiece that anybody who likes music should have to own. Brilliant.
1881273156|5.0|I can't say enough about the knowledge I gained from this.  I am amazed that he was able to pinpoint what someone needs in a relationship.  The 5 love languages are RIGHT ON!!!   If you are having any doubts about what you need in a relationship, this is a must have. I learned so much about myself... Having read this after getting divorced, I have to say that this is going to make a difference my the future.
B000002J1O|5.0|This without a doubt is the best Genesis Album from start to finish, from the first song Dancing... to Aisle of Plenty you get a completely balanced group of songs that will get to you and evoke great emotion, just listen to After the Ordeal, I've never heard such wonderful music made by a Rock Group, and then you have Firth of Fifth, Battle..., I Know... and close with one of the single greatest songs of all time by Genesis or any other artist Cinema Show. This was my first Genesis album from when Gabriel was the singer (I only had Duke, another great album) and from that moment to this day Genesis became my favorite band and if you check buy this album, listen to it and submerge in it, it won't let you go...
0679879269|4.0|Once again, I'll get the problem(s) out of the way first. This book is quite sacreligious(and that's putting it mildly). It says in its plot that God was not the true creator of the universe, that he was an angel who merely claimed he had. The &quot;true&quot; creator was unknown. Anyway, the plot. it turns out that Lyra was taken by Mrs. Coulter, and secreted away in another universe, in a cave. Will and the two angels from the end of The Subtle Knife go to rescue her. Meanwhile, Lord Asriel is assembling an army to attack the kingdom of God, destroying the so-called false creator and his &quot;henchangels.&quot; Along the journey, the Subtle Knife will be broken and repaired, ghosts will fight the living, death itself will be no longer a bad thing, and so many shocking changes will occur that the characters are hardly recognizable from the ones we first met in the first two books. If, and this is a big IF, you can ignore the sacreligious content and tell yourself it's only a work of fiction, this is an extraordinary novel, with a plot so complex I can't tell you anything more without spoiling something.
079074404X|5.0|Just to clue folks in, this film was sometimes shown on TV in the 60's and 70's with the title, &quot;Id,&quot; believe it or not. I almost bought this tape until studying the reviews and realizing I'd seen it several times. Great film though.  The most professionally done sci-fi I'm aware of prior to Kubrick's, 2001.
B00005B36H|2.0|There is all this hype about how good this album is, this CD is terrible.  I have listened to the album a good 20 times or so, and I just cant bear to play it any more.  There are some tracks on the album that you would wonder why they are even on the disc!  The Grudge and Schism may be the only 2 highlights of the disc, and the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because the album cover has some of the coolest artwork ive seen in awhile on it.  Otherwise, the disc itself is mindless, repetitive drivel.
B00000DLVA|5.0|I remember hearing &quot;Lovefool&quot; all the time when I was in 3rd grade, and always wondered who sang the song. When I found out that it was the Cardigans, I immediatley bought the cd &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;. I had heard the song &quot;My Favourite Game&quot; on the radio once, so that was another reason I wanted the cd. What a change from the &quot;Lovefool&quot; days! This cd is so dark and strange, it's safe to say that The Cardigans are now alternative rock, not pop. It seems that The Cardigans have been waiting along time to expose this, one could say frightening, side of themselves, and finally got the nerve to. The first thought that came to my mind when I heard the first song &quot;Paralyzed&quot; was Garbage's &quot;Version 2.0&quot;. Both cds have something in common, a type of gritty, uneven feel to it. When I listen to &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, it's almost as if I'm reading someones diary, or reading their mind and personal thoughts. Please buy this cd, you will not be disapointed.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I actually enjoy Moby for more of his ambient stuff, which is pretty much the 2nd half of this CD.  But the first half of the disc is still very well written!  From songs like &quot;Honey&quot;, to &quot;Inside&quot; and the very chilling &quot;My Weakness&quot; you cant miss on this one.  Moby definetly struck a winner with this album.
0064407667|5.0|I purchased this book to read aloud to my three oldest children, ages 6, 10, and 12, and they were all absolutely enthralled!  Our custom is to read one chapter a night, but they pleaded for me to read more, and . . . well, who could resist? The plot line, characters, and writing style are completely engaging, and I am only writing this review while on my way to go buy the rest of the set -- the best of the best of childrens' literature, destined to be classics!
0060392886|5.0|Anyone who's remotely interested in the lives rock stars lead or has ever sat through &quot;Behind the Music&quot; will be riveted by this book.  You don't have to be a fan of their music - I've never bought an album - to appreciate the lives they've led and that they survived overdoses, drunk driving, lawsuits, predatory family members (namely wives), and enough drugs to stun a family of elephants.  I couldn't put it down.  You come away from it with a strange kind of respect for them - not only for surviving but for forcing themselves to grow up in an industry that wants them to stay drunk, bratty infants eternally.  Let's hope they get back together (all four of the original members) and make more music and have more adventures to fuel a Dirt II.
0789723107|5.0|Wow! What a book. This is an incredible and amusing look at web usability. Several times I caught myself laughing outloud!<br />More importantly, however, is the fact that Steve Krug not only explains the why, but very specifically shows you the how. Too many books on web development/usability/design tend to leave that crucial last step out. I have always believed it was because those author simply didn't *know* how to actually create great products.<br />Krug is obviously a master. I can't wait to buy his next book. And his next, and his next....
B000002N2Z|5.0|This cd has rapmetal and slow rock all combined into one what more could you want... Especially since the time period when this album came out! It's amazing how chino sounds so much like the singer of System of A Down in this early deftones cd...But then again in some points of the cd he sounds like Corey from Slipknot... I definitely recommend this Cd...
6303036570|4.0|Carlito Brigante played by Al Pacino, while not as rivetting and frightening as Tony Montana of Scarface is a thrill to watch.  The viewer sees a once boastful criminal trying to make it on the straight and narrow and put together $75,000 to go to the Bahamas and buy into a rental car agency a gone straight con before him has started.  The only way to earn this money is to manage a disco owned by his best friend, adopted brother and attorney, played by Sean Penn who sets Carlito up in more ways than one.  While this might sound like an out of character leap for a gangster, Pacino does make Carlito's  passion to escape the world he grew up in credible.  What does lack a little credibility is Pacino's Puerto Rican accent; his muddles between Italian, Cuban and faintly Jewish, leaving one to wonder if perhaps this film could've benefitted from more research or training on the usually perfectionist Pacino's part.  Sean Penn, whose past films and personal life have left much to be desired and yet appealing promises of megastar possibilities has found his part as the slimy lawyer.  Penn is astounding, dynamic and chilling as the coked up lawyer who's willing to destroy anyone who would get in the way of his profit or safety.  Sean Penn has graduated from the Brat Pack of movie actors and is now working on his Masters in craftsmanship and ability.  This may be at least the year of his Academy Award nomination, at the least, and a possible heavy contender for Best Supporting Actor, at best.  Penelope Ann Miller, new to the screen, her past films including Awakenings is simple in her role as a dancer who loves Carlito and who acts as his moral foundation against a tide of drugs, money and crime that inevitably draw him back in.  Her acting is neither good nor bad, one isn't quite sure of what to make of Carlito falling for this Anglo girl in a film that does strongly emphasize Puerto Rican pride, honor and integrity, even amongst those who live on the wild side.  A definitemiscasting but not a horrible one, Ms. Miller does deliver a waif-like seductress energy that offsets the grit and grime of the world Carlito belongs to.  One can only suppose though that Rosie Perez or Sonia Braga were busy.  One can only suppose also that Pacino, hitting fifty along with Carlito is worthy of being paired up with such a young yisse as Ms. Miller.  I think the smell of chauvinism reeks under this.  Comedian John Leguizamo, known for his astounding HBO specials on Puerto Ricans is equally chilling and hilarious here as well.  When the audience has forgotten about Leguizamo as &quot;Benny-Blanco-From-The-Bronx&quot;, his character is drawn back into the film as one of the major cruxes of plot and character and ultimately Carlito's downfall.  Ingrid Oliver from All My Children turns in, as her film debut, a powerful performance, often times with just her eyes, as Steffie, a waitress in the disco club Carlito is forced through his friendship with Penn's character to mention.  And as the lawyer's girlfriend, Oliver shows a strength and class which makes her a young Black actress to watch.  Between Oliver and Penn turning in such moliminous performances, this film is worth seeing.   Brian DePalma, known for Carrie, Scarface, Dressed to Kill and The Untouchables, knows this gangster film noir area well, having directed Pacino before as Tony Montana.  Producer Martin Bergman having worked with Pacino on Sea of Love and Serpico also knows Pacino and his ability well.    Screenwriter David Keopp (Death Becomes Her and Jurassic Park) does turn the true life account into a plausible, taunt and constantly moving script but it does lack a freshness.  This may be where Carlito's Way runs into trouble.  These three men are too familiar with one another and may not be able to attack a new project as vigorously and freshly as in the past.    Carlito's Way seems to suffer from a lack of challenge, if you will, which resonates disturbingly throughout the film.  I honestly wanted this film to knock me out of my seat, to open up the Puerto Rican world for the masses as Scarface did to Cubans but it falls short.  There must come a time when we break from the old and create anew and Carlito's Way filmed as a 70's film doesn't break any new ground.  Based on State Supreme Court Justice Edwin Torres' novels Carlito's Way and After Hours this could've been a mega-smash as a movie and not just a group of great actors getting together to make a good film.  We, in everything that we do should strive for our best, for the greatest we can be.  We should strive for paradise and as Carlito sees himself in the end, as one of the old school he's too old for this new world of slick gangsters, he's simply the last of the true mo' Ricans.  How appropo.
0671027344|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend -- which happens frequently.  And so I bought it.  And read it.  In a day.  Really.  The narrator's a young boy.  His life seems tragic, at least complicated, more than complicated.  Stephen Chbosky's book, part of the new MTV book series, is so memorable because it is so textured.  You can feel the story -- feel as if you're living it -- with his memorable band of characters.  Read the book.  You'll see.
0060278234|5.0|I read Sabriel only last month and was instantly hooked on Garth Nix. So when I saw this book in the book store I had to pick it up. It is years after Sabriel, and it is spoken through the points of veiw, of Lirael, and Sameth who is Touchstone's and Sabriel's son. I'm not going to give it away, but I do have to say, that the next book ABHORSEN is most definetly going to be a must read.
1558908382|5.0|Because it's an irresistible movie. Elements of action, suspense, humour, and great dialogue make this entertaining, and moreover, memorable. The character Martin Blank, is played brilliantly by John Cusack, and the storyline is neat; it just keeps rolling... not a dull moment to be had. I'm not going to say anymore.. just go and watch it!
0452282152|4.0|Tracy Chevalier's novel imagines the life behind a painting, a conceit in lesser hands that could have sustained no more than a short story. Griet, the daughter of a blinded and thus unemployed tilemaker, is sent into the Vermeer household as a maid where she quickly learns the ways of servitude.  Griet is not well-liked by the senior maid nor by her mistress, both of whom are jealous of her because she, and not they, are allowed into Vermeer's studio.  Griet is beautiful and has an eye for color and order, qualities the painter finds enchanting.  How she ends up in the painting and what it does to the futures of all involved make up this tale.<br />This book is easily read in a couple of sittings - maybe even one, if you have the time.  Because I read it back to back with Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, I found it lacking in complexity and depth, but was a good read all the same.  Griet's chores in the household are well imagined and precise, and the historical details Chevalier provides, particularly those pertaining to the grinding and creation of color, are a delight.  While Vermeer himself seems elusive as a character, almost as though the author were afraid of giving him flesh, the other major characters are solid. I couldn't help liking Griet and feeling for her difficult position.<br />This is an excellent vacation book, not demanding but still evocative. You don't have to be interested in art or Vermeer or historical fiction to enjoy this book.  It stands on its own as the story of a young woman coming of age and learning where her place in the world lies.
B00005KFUM|5.0|What is with all the Radiohead comparisons??? Matt Bellamy is NOT Thom Yorke, and nor does he want to be (anymore). I think that, instead of trying to emulate the highly sensitive angst-ridden haunting beauty which Radiohead have perfected, MUSE have gone for the outrageous, crazy, operatic and slightly psychotic sound. Call it Queen, call it space opera, call it what you want, but I like it. Origin of Symmetry is a new and refreshing album; one which takes courage to produce amongst today's mellow britpop guitars and sissy vocals. Although a tad too ostentatious at times, the musicianship from the band is quite excellent; the guitars are versatile, and Bellamy even brings in the organ, ala phantom of the opera. Matt's voice soars to Buckleyesque heights, and at times it feels as if he is actually inside my stereo. You've gotta love the sheer guts of MUSE. It's a wicked album.
B000002I25|5.0|This was an amazing album, from &quot;break on through&quot; to the 11 minute &quot;The end&quot; the album never goes bad.  The cover depicts the music inside, the cover is strange and the music is pretty much out this world.  Jim Morrison offers convincing lyrics and does some amazing singing, Ray Manzarek is a Keyboard genious, John Densmore delivers tight drumming, and Robby Kreiger.  This band also had no real rhythm section because the bassist was either sessionist or Ray played keyboard bass.  The Doors also show how they can experiment styles with &quot;Alabama song&quot; a german Opera and Chicago style blues with Willie Dixon's &quot;back door man&quot; with howls, grunts, and screaming courtesy of Jim.  This album took a long time to rise to the top but as soon as the amazing masterpiece &quot;light my fire&quot; was edited from a little over 7 minutes to 3 they were getting #1 albums and bigger concerts.  Not to mention singing, &quot;girl we couldnt' get much higher&quot; on Ed Sullivan when he was told not to.  The Doors were an amazing band and if you are a big fan there's a good chance you have more than one version of this debut.
0440219078|5.0|I found this book to be one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. I could understand the rationale behind the utopian design, and I could even see its merits. Conversely, I found myself yearning for Jonas to choose the emotion-filled free-will life. Already an optimist, after reading The Giver, I saw our world as an even more wonderful place.
B00004YKSD|4.0|I can't really explain this movie, it is a piece of art unlike no other I have ever seen released in '91, 20 years after Morrison's passing.  Val Kilmer plays the role of Jim Morrison and even thought a little extreme at sometimes does a good job, VERY GOOD!  True, the movie is a little over the top and Jim wasn't necessarily as evil as they made him but it got the main points, he loved excess and was always breaking ground, the rules, and got into trouble.  The end is very short compared to the rest of the movie but that's how it was, no one knew for sure if Jim had really died of a heart attack, drugs, etc. and no autopsy was made, therefore Oliver Stone didnt' add his own little twist like he did with JFK and Platoon.  This is a classic rock bio pic and deserves more recognition than it is getting.  I don't own the DVD or any of the movie but I've seen it many times and I just know that the DVD has the interviews plus the missing parts from the movie so I bet it's good.  The movie has some great concert sequences I think, recapturing the Doors while they were live and Val doing his best Jim Morrison screams and singing which makes me wish he sang &quot;Light my fire&quot; and &quot;Roadhouse blues&quot; on vh1 storytellers instead of Scott Staap who thinks he's more Eddie Vedder than Jim Morrison, I bet Jim isn't too pleased with someone like Scott singing his songs but oh well.  All in all a great movie, get this and &quot;the song remains the same&quot; from Zeppelin and you have essential rock movies.
B000055WIQ|5.0|This is by far the most frightening and disturbing film ofall-time. Such infamous scenes as the girl's head spinning will scarethe [stuff]  out of u. It was so terrifing in fact that some parts I just had to fast-foward past. (Though I'm going to try to  watch it straight through next time I decide to watch it) So if u want to attempt to give yourself a heart-attack, raise blood pressure, and stay wide-eyed 4 the next few weeks, I highly recommend buying this unbelievable horror film from 1973!
B000009EAD|5.0|I stumbled across Iced Earth by sheer accident one day when I was killing time online. I was intrigued by the titles of some of their albums and the fact that they combined Metallica heaviness with Maiden lyrics. Since then I have bought all their albums and enjoyed each one immensley and Something Wicked was just that. All of Iced Earth's song styles are present on this album. Fast, slow, melodic and even a ballad (I use it loosely to describe Watching Over Me). The highlights on this album include 1776, Burning Times, Blessed Are You, and the final trilogy of songs, but all of them are great. The musicianship is once again up to IE standards. Jon Schaffer grinding away pounding rhythms on his guitar with the assistance of James McDonough on the base. He is a better rhythm player than James Hetfield could ever hope to be. Larry Tarnowski proves that he is a competent successor to Randall Shawver. Although I miss his wild solos that seem to go all over place without sounding bad and his writing input. Matt Barlow's voice is once again charged with passion rarely seen nowadays. And the drumming, provided by &quot;the Creeper&quot; is good as well. In short, this album is full of inspired songs, tight musicianship and an atmospheric feel that is all too rare in metal today.
B00003CWTI|5.0|&quot;I have so much love to give,&quot; says William H. Macy's character towards the end of Magnolia.  &quot;I just don't know where to put it.&quot;  He might well be speaking for director Paul Thomas Anderson, whose obvious love -- for filmmaking, for actors, for his characters, for humanity, for himself -- is bursting the seams of this sprawling, maddening, stunning, exhausting tour de force. The cast list reads like a Who's Who of contemporary character actors, each pitch perfect in their role.  The themes are weighty and densely interwoven: the inheritance of dysfunction and flawed love from parent to child; the desperate need (and inability) to love and be loved it leaves behind; the small acts of forgiveness that sustain us; the marvels of everyday life; the ubiquity of chance and coincidence.  The soundtrack, mostly provided by Aimee Mann, is no mere backdrop but an integral element, a unifying and revelatory voice.  The direction and cinematography are obsessive in detail.  The non-linear, pointillist narrative structure often draws comparisons to Robert Altman, but a more apt analogue is the work of postmodern author David Foster Wallace, whose dense prose also challenges us to find thematic and emotional connections among seemingly disparate events.  Magnolia refuses to give viewers what they have been trained to anticipate from a film, and at three hours, it is anything but escapist -- it is a challenge to its audience's aesthetic expectations and their humanity.  Those that meet the challenge, who are willing to forgive Anderson's pretensions, as his characters ultimately forgive each other's, are rewarded with one of the most emotionally involving and wrenching films of this or any age.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I bought this c.d. the day after I saw the movie, which I also love.  i can't say enough good things here..It's an awesome soundtrack!!! The tunes on here will have humming along, and eventually, you'll start singing along and having a grand old time. Like many of the other reviewers here, I am not a huge fan of this genre of music usually. On sunday mornings, just put on this c.d, read the paper, have yuor coffee..It really is great relaxing music whether you are a fan or not.  I highly recommend this for all music fans who would like to expand their horizons.  There are some catchy bluesy tunes, and some softer selections that will help you relax.
B00003CXRP|4.0|i liked this movie alot. had alot of drama. the plane crase kinda scared me a little, because i am afraid of planes. but it was still a good movie. bye
B00003CXHJ|4.0|I thought this was a very good MOVIE (not a documentary).  The action scenes held my attention, although I thought the ending was a little lame.  Regarding the reviews from our friends down under, I don't recall it being stated in the movie that this was the first capture of an Enigma machine.  Also, after months at sea, don't you think the Germans would look scruffy and unclean?  Did you notice the Germans on the destroyer looked clean-cut?  Take this for what it is - a good action/adventure movie, not a documentary.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Well, it is my favorite movie, but it lacks of drama. I think most people think Stars Wars is all about action, but i think it should have comedy, drama, and action. Now that would give it a wonderful rating in the theaters. I loved the lightsaber battle, with Darth Maul, Obi-wen, and Qui-Gon. I thought the costumes were good too. If Episode 2 is like i said this one should of been, than Episode 2 will have no problems with making money. PEACE EVERYBODY.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Good all the way through.  They released their best cut first, and the rest are good, but no surprises.  Glad I bought it.
B000053VAF|3.0|i really liked this movie, it was funny and had action. but no drama, well some drama. this did get good ratings in the theaters and i understand those ratings but i think my ratings make more sense. bye
B00000IAU3|4.0|Why can't we have 4 1/2 stars.  This is a great first album.  Quiet, but groovy.  Sinead O'Connor?  No outrage on this album, and Dido's voice is altogether different.  She expresses a happy sort of passion and has great voice.  And, strangely enough, you could throw it on the CD player and dance to it.  Great lyrics.<br />Enough already, just BUY IT!
B00003CXS4|3.0|i only saw moview once so i cant really say much about it except that it was funny and a good movie. bye
B000002UUX|5.0|This has been my favorite Megadeth cd for many years now.  I'm a huge Megadeth fan and love all their music (yes, even Risk).  I'm torn now between it and thier new one, The World Needs a Hero.  It's the best they've done in years.  Hell, everything they do is great!  Just buy them all!  (Especially this one.)
B000001FSU|4.0|I've got several Anthrax cd's and this is the best, in my opinion.  The whole cd is good thrash metal with great drumming throughout.  I've always liked the vocals during this era much better than John Bush's.  But the new stuff is great too.  If  you like this, check out Practice What You Preach by Testament.  Great cd.
B000002IOJ|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  I got it about 8 years ago and just couldn't stop listening to it.  Testament quickly became one of my favorite metal bands.  This cd is thrash metal at it's best.  It's high on my list of top ten favorite metal cds.  This ranks up there with Metallica's And Justice For All, Megadeth's Rust In Peace, and Anthrax's State of Euphoria.  Every fan of older style metal should own this cd.
0061002747|5.0|I will not discuss the book which is, in my opinion, one of Agatha's best. I would like to mention a clue that seems to be overlooked by Poirot. This message does not reveal who the murderer is, but you should not read it unless you already read Orient Express, because it might spoil you the fun.<br />The clue is about compartments in the railroad car. As you know, the murderer(s) wanted to book up all the compartments in the Istanbul - Calais car, but the compartment number 1 has been booked months before, by the company's director, Mr. Buck (Poirot ended in that compartment later). Now that implicates that the compartments were allocated sequentially. Mr. Rechet got the compartment number 2, his valet Mr. Masterman got the bed number 4 (the first available bed in the second class) while his secretary Mr. McQueen got the bed number 6 in the next second class compartment. All that implicates some kind of the plot, since the car was obviously empty (except for Mr. Buck) before Rechet and his escort booked their tickets, and then all the sudden the whole bunch came. <br />Let us proceed. In his statement Mr. McQueen states that the valet always traveled second class, but he (McQueen) usually traveled first class, so that his employer, Mr. Rechet could use McQueen's compartment to store his own luggage. But on this occasion all the first class compartments were booked, so McQueen had to travel second class. Now that is a highly suspicious statement - Rechet got number 2, and McQueen and Masterman got the first two class 2 compartments. It seems like first class compartments 3 (etc.) and the complete second class was empty when Mr. Rechet's ticket was bought and that McQueen did not want to be in the compartment number 3, next to Rechet's, for some reasons of his own. He also did not want to share the compartment with Masterman, since they could probably have booked beds number 4 and 5. All that strongly points to some kind of the conspiracy engineered by McQueen who, as a secretary, was in charge of booking tickets.
B000002WYT|5.0|dmb is a great band to begin with... but Crash was probably their best cd to this day. I liked everyday and before these crowded streets but crash was better than both of them. i think anyone who likes dmb should get the crash album. listen to me, i have all the dmb cd's.
B00000099Y|5.0|Okay I finally bought this album after going through agony of listening what I could scrounge and listening to my Lateralus Album.  This is one of the mose intense, the mose deep, and the most musically...jammin bands I have ever gotten into.  <br />Maynard James Keenan seems to look into life itself and pull some of the mose abstract and some of the most obvious things that people never notice.  Adam Jones, Dana Carry, and Justin Chancellor back him up incredibly with a musical assault of a hard rock.  People who say that they are no more deep than a frying pan are probably shallow themselves and cannot understand the subtle phenomenoms(sp?) in this music.  <br />My fav songs are Eulogy, Jimmy, 46 &amp; 2 and I better stop before I say every song on the album.  <br />I'd recomend this album to anybody who likes to think and broaden their mind.  And like somebody said send them money, they sold their souls the make that record (&quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot;)
B00004XOWM|1.0|This CD is just plain horrible. We all need to be embarrised for for purchasing this.  Limp's first 2 CDs are good CDs, they deserved the attention they got.  But now they seriously need to get a new job.  Fred Durst makes himself look foolish on many occasions.  Just listen to him rap, Wu-tang makes him look like the next Vanilla Ice.  It wasn't nearly as bad in Significant Other.  The lyrics as a whole are dumber than Sully's and Chino's combined.  He sounds more childish then anyone Iv'e heard.  He tries to rap then talks about \\"taggin\\" on a skateboard then talks about how hard he'll knock you out.  It is so obvious that he just follows and annoys the human population.  Then, he tries to make fun of Trent Reznor because he shot a ball through his face in a video.(Trent made fun of himself also in that video).  Fred just makes himself look extremely stupid.  He would have to make ten albums to catch up to all the people taking quibs at him.  My main point is to stay away from this and do not go out and buy this.
B00005B36H|4.0|Since I never had Tool's older albums, I'm writing on neutral lines.  The first 10 songs are all great and give them a very rich and diverse sound.  Songs like The Patient, The Grudge, Parabol+(a), Schism, Ticks and Leeches, and Lateralis are definite standouts and some are long pieces that most bands could never produce.  But tracks 11-13 are throw-away tracks.  11 goes on forever with the same boring arabic beat with a small element being added every minute.  12 is just too chaotic, and it has no substance.  13 makes does not fit in at all and could be recorded by a 3 year old.  Some Tool fans will say the cliched &quot;this guy can't comprehend Tool.&quot;  To those I say SOME Tool fans are blindly obssesed and if Tool recorded their music through a plunger it would be an epic.  This CD should be in anyones collection for the first ten songs alone.  But it is by no means perfect because of the sloppiness of the last 3 songs.
B00004Z311|4.0|Everybody's still waiting for Legend to come out on DVD.  And 6 months after it's initial release date, it seems we're still no closer to a resolution.  I don't know what the hold up is for, but I wish they'd resolve it soon.  Legend has never even been released in its original aspect ratio (2.35:1) here in the states (on video or Laserdisc), so getting the DVD will be a real treat for everybody.  I just wish I knew when that day will be?<br><br>At any rate, I do remember seeing some extended scenes of Legend when it was shown on TV. Among them was the scene involving the water hag, Meg, who wanted to eat Tom Cruise. The extended part showed him trying to talk his way out of the ordeal and play to Meg's vanity, referring to her as Mistress Meg. He uses his shield as a mirror for her to look at, while fumbling with his sword to which he drops. Meg tells him he has a sweet tongue then attempts to eat him as he grabs the sword just in time to behead her. I know it was cut !for time, but honestly the scene makes more sense when presented this way. <br><br>As for who scores the movie better, it's a toss up for me. I love Jerry Goldsmith, but the trend at the time was to use rock bands to score fantasy type movies (Brit band, Queen for Flash Gordon, Toto for David Lynch's Dune, and Lamahl performing the title track for The Nevereneding Story) and with Tangerine Dream it works just as well. I also enjoyed Bryan Ferry's \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" because it really fits well in the fantasy element with its dense but moody atmosphere that it evokes. But then again, Goldsmith wrote the book on fantasy with films like Supergirl and the Star Trek movies. Obviously it comes down to a matter of personal taste. But the film works either way.<br><br>So Legend fans, keep the faith alive and never give up.  One day, our time will come.
B000003CKH|5.0|CAKE's best album is definitely Prolonging the Magic for the depth of sound and flow from track to track. I am a huge fan of their music, but for most casual fans, those into pop/rock/alt, this is the album for you. The Distance is the most popular song on the album by far. The 3 covers including I Will Survive are done so well you will think that CAKE wrote them themselves. I really don't know how CAKE can take such a variety of styles and make it their own, but they do one heck of a job. Frank Sinatra is my favorite song on the album, but all of them rule. Everyone should have at least one CAKE album in their collections.
0060392886|5.0|Unreal!! It's better than fiction. If you want to take your mind, and keep your mind off your troubles, woes, or hard times, read this book! It's impossible to think of anything else while you're reading every delicious and discussting word.
B00005K3OT|2.0|Chocolat is too long and dull for 2 hours. I cannot belive this film was nominated for Best Picture. Though the other nominations were well deserved except for Best Score. I usually am a sucker for a film like this, but this film tries too hard to be a good romantic comedy. In my opinion, the only thing that saves this film are the wonderful performances by Judi Dench and Johnny Depp. Depp's performance deserved a oscar nomination. I absolutely flipped when I heard this received a Best Picture nomination, and it's nomination should have gone to Wonder Boys. Overall, I give this 2 stars out of 4, only because of the great performances by Dench and Depp.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I didn't expect much when I went to see this movie. All I knew was that Sean Connery and Anna Paquin were in the movie, which I thought a strange combination. In truth, their characters interact little, though they are bound by an innercity youth who is a brilliant writer. The story is engaging, at times suprising and heartwarming. It's not an action thriller or a sports movie, but it is a wonderful movie about people and their talents. Highly Recommended.
0671449028|5.0|The Going to Bed Book is the first Boynton book I ever purchased.  I read it endlessly to my daughter when she was about 2 years old and got to the point where I could recite it from memory.  Now that she's older, SHE can read it to ME!  It's a very good book--complete with all the rituals that people do before going to bed (brushing teeth, etc.).  Sandra Boynton has done a good job of bringing the bedtime rituals to a level that a small child (and a tired mommy) can appreciate.  After reading it, you will be ready for bed yourself.
B0000024U8|5.0|I'm sorry with my english. In this CD, the song &quot;Season of the Witch' is an excellent example for the music years ago. I can tell you It's incredible this music. If you like it, you will like the folowing bands: &quot;Quicksilver Messenger Service&quot; (Who do you love), &quot;Horizons&quot; (The greatest show on the earth), &quot;El Ritual&quot; (Bajo el Sol y Frente a Dios, and Easy Woman). &quot;El Ritual&quot; is a mexican band. If you can get this CD album, buy it, even the &quot;Sthephen Stills &amp; Al Kopper&quot; about I'm writing.
0380788624|5.0|Blending near future fiction with historical novel, Cryptonomicon shows Stephenson has come far as a writer since Snow Crash. His straightforward mastery of the language, along with his irrepressible humor (think Vonnegut or Heller), made this book a joy to read. This book is not cyberpunk, but readers of his other works should enjoy it immensely. As long as the book is, it reads fast. And if you are a novice to cryptology, this book will teach you a lot as an added bonus, or at least give you tantalizing hints to follow up on with net searches and further reading. I also learned a great deal of historic fact about world war two from all the details Stephenson incorporated into the story. Computer and ham radio geeks of all ages will particularly enjoy this book due to the technology involved and several computer geek type characters and plotting in the near future fiction part. A few cruder passages generally relating to the inability of one of the characters to get enough...ahem...action left me nearly rolling on the floor. Although not really science fiction except in the loosest sense, Cryptonomicon is destined to be one of the best, in whatever genre it happens to fall. The book may be a little offensive to some people of Japanese extraction, since it deals pretty brutally with some of the unfortunate behavior of the japanese military in WW II.
B00000JMQE|5.0|I saw this movie when I was young on the Disney Channel and I was really scared, especially when Mombi takes off her heads, and when she sleeps headless and wants to catch Dorothy, it still gives me the chills. Anyway, a few months later, it played again and I taped it. Why? I have no clue but I must have liked it back then and after that it stayed on the shelf unwatched. A few years back, I started watching it again and again and I loved it (I still do), Fairuza Balk was definitely born to play the part of Dorothy. In the version I had taped, I noticed that some scenes had been taken out compared to the prior version I had seen and I remembered them so when I got this wonderful DVD, I saw that some missing scenes were quite important to the plot and that the editors carelessly cut them out. I also started to read the Oz books, so, if you're looking for accuracy in this movie, you have the wrong one, they completely mixed up The Marvelous Land Of Oz and Ozma Of Oz with an entirely new background story. But if there is one reason why you should watch this movie, it's for the mood, contrarily to the first one where you watched it for the munchkins. And although I liked that one, I find it too musical, too happy and too dramatic (Dorothy cries hysterically out of nothing, give me a break!). <br />If you don't believe me here are the most important reason that make RTOz the best of the two:<br />--This Oz is much closer to the one Baum invented<br />--Dorothy looks her age<br />--She is faced with real dangers (NOT Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!!)<br />--She doesn't cry every ten minutes<br />--She doesn't burst into song every ten minutes<br />Anyhow, Return To Oz will amaze you and you'll never want to go back to Judy Garland. It's also made by Disney so you know it's gotta be good. Although it may not be suitable for young children, anyone who read the Oz books and who are not overly attached to Judy Garland and her version should love this indefinetly.
0789723107|5.0|Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug is a must-have and a must-read for all Web designers! (Sounds like a big marketing cliche, but it's true. No, Steve didn't pay me to write that opening remark, and I'm not one of Steve's friends either.) <br />Don't Make Me Think is full of important and very useful design tactics.  I like how this book approaches the subject of Web usability too.  Other books try to tackle the same subject, but usually belabor the message. As a result, the book ends up being 500 pages long and full of lofty and condescending theory---Not this book. (&quot;Don't make me read another encyclopedia on design theory!!!&quot;) Don't Make Me Think was fun and easy to read. All the topics that Steve addresses, I've heard before in many a circle of designers---Steve had an answer for each of my personal design concerns too. In addition to the well-written text are the colorful screen shots that serve as excellent examples of each Web usability topic. (The Web Design Funnies in Chapter 8---a little comic strip parody on Web usability, design and marketing meetings---is a classic!  A hilarious take on a subject that some folks that WAY too seriously.)<br />I highly recommend this book to designers, marketers, and developers who constantly work to improve their sites and whose goal is to maximize the user experience. C'mon everyone, this isn't rocket science! But, the subject is still very important and should be examined if your goal is to convey the correct message on the Internet. This book will help you master the nuances of clear, effective, fun and clever Web design.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Yes this was better than E.T. and Tootsie(although those are also great films). In the great tradition of great movie epics this one runs 200 minutes and every minute is worth savoring. Ben Kingsley gives a brilliant performance as Gandhi, one of the all time great humans. It's beautifully shot throughout and despite knowing the events and the outcomes it is still marvelous to view them. You can also watch this movie a hundred times and not get bored of it.
0804106304|5.0|Through the stories of these Chinese immigrant women and their daughters, Amy Tan gives us a story that everyone can access: the story of the past and the future meeting in the present through the relationships of parents with children. I was astonished to find my own view of my relationship with my parents changing as I read the book. I found I could actually understand better where my parents were coming from. Now that's a powerful book to convey that sort of universality!
B00004BZ16|5.0|Many have complained that Sandinista is a sprawling mess, but that is altogether untrue. There is, in fact, very little on this album that I would want removed. The sheer length of the lp may contribute to it's neglect, though. It's not for short attention spans; it's an album to lose yourself in.
B000056K04|4.0|Most people fall into the catefory of either liking DMB or hating them.  If you did not like any of the previous efforts, this one will grab you.  Dave seems to be happy here and the melodies on this album are clear and non-stop.  It still has his trademarl syncopated rythms, so if that is not up your alley, don't but it.  But the music is fun and great to drive to.  Give it a shot with this one a nd you may be able to figure out ehat the fuss is all about.
B00002NDB1|4.0|It is the second Iron Maiden album featuring Blaze Bayley. It is important to consider that it is impossible to find another &quot;Bruce Dickinson&quot;... simply Blaze Bayley has a different singing style. The songs in this album are not as introspective and dark as in The X Factor but: 1) Riffs are all beautiful. 2) The songs are an attempt to content the fans: there were so many bad opinions about The X Factor (only fans were not able to accept the new singer) that Harris decided to make a new desperately bad produced album.<br />If you listen The X Factor for several times, than you are ready to listen Virtual XI.<br />If somebody is unable to accept Blaze singing style, I suggest him/her to buy the Blaze album: &quot;Silicon Messiah&quot;: it is a pleasing surprise (and a real good album).<br />((sorry for my bad english... but I'm good only in speaking Italian))
B000002UYZ|5.0|This 2 cd set has 26 of their greatest hits from 62/66. The nice thing about this collection is, is that all the songs have been digitally remastered, unlike a lot of their individual albums. And it comes with a 24 page booklet that includes all the lyrics and quite a few photos. So even though you may have the individual albums that these songs appear on, this way you get them with much better sound quality. Which for most Beatles fans, is a necessity.
B00001IVOR|5.0|This album is dope, don't front on it!!!!! Name another album that is as hardcore as this in terms of staying true to hip hop, as in beats and rymes, you can't!!! Today to be popular you have to do songs with R&amp;B hooks, the Wu is the best yesterday, today, and until someone puts out an album that doesn't reley on crossover appeal to sell. If you don't like it, stick to pop like DMX (who did a song with Sisqo, ahhh) and Ja Rule (who lipsinks his raps).
0060920432|4.0|With the recent scientific investigations into the psycho-physiological roots of religious experience, this ten-year-old book bears re-discovery. While not overtly spiritual in nature, this book could perhaps become the basis for a new spirituality -- one where personal happiness is the highest goal, and optimal experience is the means by which it is achieved. Anyone who is interested in spirituality (even non-supernaturalist spirituality) and psychology will find this author's work worth investigating.
B00004STPT|5.0|I am young, let's leave it at that and I love Rome. It's culture, it's landscape and of course, it's history. When Gladiator came out, I was amazed and I have loved it ever since. I have the DVD &amp; VHS. But when I heard the music inside the movie, I loved it. It fit in so well. This soundtrack is number 1 and agree.....whoever rates this soundtrack *1 star* is nutty in the head! LOL.
B00000JJQK|5.0|What do you know, the album officially considered The Greatest Of All Time might just be that.  I am innately hostile to canons, their systems of values and generally crippling influence - they close down thought rather than encourage it - but I think it's fair to say that the influence of the Beach Boys, and 'Pet Sounds' in particular, has inspired most of the great imaginative pop of the last three decades.<br />Considering its reputation for sonic adventurousness, I was expecting something more lush, more sound-heavy, but 'Pet Sounds' is actually quite austere, effects never promoted at the expense of the beautiful songs.  The most dominant feature is that thrilling soul-shuddering thump-drum echoing in vast Spector-al spaces, making intense and urgent great catchy songs like 'I'm waiting for the day', 'I know there's an answer' and 'Here today'.  <br />There's a mirroring of types on the album, where similar songs reflect and transform each other: the serene sleepiness of 'Don't talk' refracting the shocked tragedy of 'Caroline no'; the frustrated dream of 'Wouldn't it be nice' and the frustrating intentions of 'Here today''s narrator.<br />'Pet sounds' is one of the great exposes of the male psyche, with its less endearing, more devious and self-serving impulses - 'I'm waiting for the day' and 'Here today' especially.  Best of all is the tragi-bathos of 'Sloop John B', a male appropriation of the Shangri-La's' traumatic pop, made un-tragic by youthful male ridiculousness, yet still moving with its (and the album's?) refrain 'I want to go home'.
0671027573|5.0|So, right up front you should know I love anything Linda Howard writes.  Mr. Perfect is no exception.  At the time of this review I think there were 176 reviews written.  I'm wondering what I could say that someone else hasn't already said.  More humor in this book than her previous works.  Think Janet Evanovich.  In fact, Ms. Howard's latest heroine reminds me a lot of JE's Stephanie Plum.  High praise!!  LH's hero is not quite as in your face macho as her previous heros but he is macho enough and a guy to die for (make that live for).  LH, if you read this (Yeah, like that's gonna happen!), PLEASE write another western.  Mr. Perfect - a keeper that I've added to my LH collection.  I would recommend Anne Stuart to all LH fans.
B00004WGY9|4.0|'Searching for the young soul rebels' begins with someone fiddling with a radio finding only mindless fuzz (including, cheekily, 'Anarchy in the UK'), before Kevin Rowland switches it off, bluntly ordering 'For God's sake, burn it down', answered by a gang's call to arms, and the pounding opening song.  It is a frightening moment, demanding a leap of faith and unswerving devotion from the listener, a demand that our heart and soul is purified from all the numbing cultrual rubbish that surrounds us, made new and true, worthy to look on the New Soul Vision, evangelised by a uniformed gang of street toughs.<br />It's such a brilliant idea - melding the sound and emotional depth of Stax and Northern Soul to the aggression and rigour of punk - you wonder why no-one else had thought of it, and why few have done it since.  <br />'Rebels' is one of the great proletarian albums, one that records and celebrates working class life, its cameraderie and energy, and polemicises that its soul need not be the diminished concrete-dimmed bleakness Mike Leigh and Ken Loach would have us believe, but bursts of brass exploding from rigid confines (of course, behind the scenes, the reality was less romantic!). Pulp have done something similar with disco, and the origin of Jarvis' obsessive monologues, where the tawdry everyday is elevated to the intensely dramatic can be found in songs like 'Seven days too long', 'Keep it' and 'Love part one'.  Chris Roberts said Dexy's made the greatest album in the world twice.  Here's the first.
B00005BCK6|5.0|It's so great trek is now on dvd.These are two of my favorite episodes.&quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; is histerical,but very intelligent.&quot;By Any Other Name&quot; is a very interesting episodes with unique trek elements.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Every adult that I have talked to loves this movie for the simple fact that it reminds all of us what it was being a kid.  Exploring with your friends on those Saturday mornings and discovering all sorts of treasures.  I love watching this movie on rainy days with my children.  I have lost track of the number of times I have seen it.  I am so glad that it is coming out on DVD.  Without question, this is a MUST have for anyones collection.
B000000WA4|5.0|&quot;Time is never time at all, you can never ever leave/without taking a piece of youth&quot; sings Billy Corgan delicately to open the first non-instrumental track on the Smashing Pumpkins' most ambitious album. Indeed, time and life and youth turn out to be themes of this amazing album, although Corgan has stated this is not specifically a concept album. This theme is never echoed more strongly or touchingly than in the stunning &quot;Muzzle&quot;, which has anthemic, soaring music coupled with probably my favorite lyrics ever. The lyrics &quot;I fear that I am ordinary just like everyone&quot; and &quot;Time heals but I'm forever broken&quot; beautifully sum up everything Corgan is on about. Other highlights from the first disc, subtitled &quot;Dawn to Dusk&quot; in keeping with the album's cyclical theme, include the mental, blisteringly fast and loud &quot;Jellybelly&quot; which contrasts sharply with the dreamier, more optimistic &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; that precedes it; &quot;Zero&quot;, which might be regarded as Corgan's personal theme song, carries a killer riff and creates a dark mood; &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot;, understandably the biggest hit from the album, has an absolutely unforgettable chorus and instant-classic lyrics; &quot;Cupid de Locke&quot; and &quot;Galapagos&quot; are dreamy, drifting and memorable in their beauty and simple arrangements while the  9-minute monster &quot;Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans&quot; has two many riffs and hooks to count and dreamy lyrics to match. Certainly the darker of the two discs, &quot;Twilight to Starlight&quot; opens with the oft-overlooked but extremely worthy &quot;Where Boys Fear To Tread&quot;, whose metaphorical pit of darkness is unlike anything the Pumpkins, and indeed anyone else, has ever recorded. The hard-rocking &quot;Bodies&quot; finds Corgan at his angriest but is soon soothed by the lullaby-like softness of the beautiful &quot;Thirty-Three&quot;. &quot;1979&quot;, a contender for the album's best song (and also Corgan's personal favorite), has a strange riff that will never leave your head and wistful lyrics about Corgan's youth. It is unfortunately followed by &quot;Tales Of A Scorched Earth&quot; which is the only slip-up on a remarkably consistent (and long, at 2 hours +) album. This could easily have been replaced by many of the far superior b-sides of the era which later cropped up on the 5-disc throwaway set &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot;. Later gems include the beastlike, chugging &quot;X.Y.U.&quot;, which is a potent and explosive 7-minute piece of rage, but whose anger is quickly smoothed over by the closing trilogy of slow, beatiful songs. &quot;Beautiful&quot; is the pick of the three; its final moments, finding Corgan's reassuring lyrics of &quot;I'll be under your stars forever&quot; are among the most spine-tingling moments I've ever heard in a song. And the solo piano that closes &quot;Farewell And Goodnight&quot; is the perfect way to end the album and link it to its lighter version which starts the first disc. This album has immense personal meaning for me and I rank it up with Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot; as one of the best albums of all time. Although the Pumpkins' other albums are almost universally brilliant, especially &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, this album has it all.
0440539811|4.0|The novel is a self-contradictory mess.  There are too many characters.  The plot is incoherent at best.  Things which desperately need explanations don't get them.  The point-of-view keeps changing with no attempt to explain who's narrating now, and why they're doing whatever they're doing.  Obscure  references to everything from the Sect of the Assassins to John Dillinger keep popping up needlessly.  Several self-contained, and mutually exclusive, world histories are presented.  The novel's tone changes radically from one page to another, loping awkwardly from deadpan parody to soft-core porn to highbrow pseudo-intellectual to full-blown apocalyptic (including several nasty descriptions of where bad people go when they die [or don't]).  <br />And I couldn't put it down.
6305622957|4.0|Very accurate, with a balanced account of the events leading to the start of America entering WW II.
B000000QG8|5.0|This album captures one of Ireland's most loved musicians. He is back in his native land at the pinnacle of his powers. Perfectly capturing the live connection between the audience and performer, \\"Irish Tour\\", is not only one of Rory Gallagher's best albums, but is surely one of the best live albums ever released. The album was recorded in Belfast, Dublin and Cork, and shows Rory putting in some performances of awesome power. The fact that, after 28 years, it still makes you yearn to be there in the audience when Rory, in his check lumber jack shirt and battered stratacaster in hand, drags the band back on stage for the fourth or fifth encore speaks for itself.  This line up of the Rory Gallagher band had already released 2 albums and been on the road for 2 years, so they were as tight as the British Lions front row of the 1974 tour of South Africa. Rory could just let himself go, knowing that the band would follow him anywhere with an understanding and passion of the music they played - like Barry John to a young Gareth Edwards, \\"You chuck it son, I'll catch it\\".  By 1974 Rory's development and belief in his own abilities is almost palpable as is his confidence. He allows Lou Martin, the keyboard player, plenty of space to shine with solos before Rory storms back to show who is the boss. Throughout this album the guitar tone is colourful and hard hitting, whilst still maintaining a controlled sensitivity. Rory constantly demonstrates his incredible guitar technique. It is definitely worth pointing out skillful backing chord work, volume control and his switching of tone which deepen the musical expression of the album.  The M.C.'s announcement and the sound of Rory tuning his guitar before the opening song, \\"Cradle Rock\\", gives an atmospheric intro to the album.  The songs are a fine collection of self composed numbers and splendid cover versions. Rory made J.B.Hutto's \\"Too Much Alcohol\\" one of his own. It perfectly captures the warmth between audience and artist, especially when Rory and the fans count from 91-100. Another classic originally recorded for the \\"Tattoo\\" album is the 10 minute workout of \\"A Million Miles Away\\", where the musical development from the original studio recording is outstanding.  `Irish tour' shows Rory's different characters, from the gutsy hard rocking guitar hero to delicate, gentle performer. His unique style shines through on every track.  This album has sold in excess of two million copies worldwide and is a must for any Rory fan wanting their live `fix'.  During the live set closer, \\"Who's that coming\\", you can almost hear the adrenaline pumping through the viens of both band and crowd, as the music builds and accelerates into a truly dynamic sound with each band member playing his heart out and Rory really excelling himself on slide guitar. As the band leave the stage you are left with the Cork crowd singing: \\"Nice one Rory  Nice one Son  Nice one Rory  Let's have another one\\". Nice one indeed Rory. Mott the Dog.especially when Rory and the fans count from 91-100.

014028009X|1.0|Why do so many people love this book?? I just don't get it! I' m not sinlge, and I've never been into counting calories, but I don't think I would have appreciated it even if I didn't have those &quot;disadvantages&quot;.  The only reason I finished it is because it's coming up in my book club now with the film and everything. If it wasn't for that, no way. It's no fun, it's boring, it lacks uplifting qualities like beautiful language or vivid characters or interesting plot. If you want to read about relationships, pick something else. Anything else. Please!
B00003CXRP|3.0|That sad thing is that the only part of this movie I remember clearly and that had more to it than the scenes I saw in the TV spots was that incredible plane crash sequence.  <br />I still have nightmares about that sequence.  But then, this movie has me seeing the FedEx logo in my sleep.  Zemeckis is brilliant with this kind of high-tech, meticulous filmmaking process where thousands of things happen at once and are clearly memorable in the process after the movie is over and down the street at the coffee shop after the credits have faded.    However, I only distinctly remember three moments in the movie after that...Tom Hanks in Short Beard.   Tom Hanks in Long Beard with Soccer Ball.  Tom Hanks at home without soccer ball, but pining for Helen Hunt...not the ball.  There were some things that I latch onto with some thought... like making fire, stealing the shoes off a corpse, asking the professor how the radio could work after three years on the island....but that might be a sleep bleed-through from TV Land.<br />Sorry to say, I just didn't like it.  When I say that I know there was a tremendous amount of work that went into it and a lot of money and time and talent...but you'd think through all that I'd remember something more than I do.  Sorry...I own the 2-disk set and even the commentary doesn't jog my memory.<br />Oh well.  I'll try better with my next review.
B000002H70|5.0|if you could say the best album to date would be, what would it be? for me this is it. meloncholy at its best, pure and simple. it is impossible to top this album. this is over the top.
B00000IQC8|5.0|The reason to buy a DVD player is to get these kind of movies and watch them with the added features.  Sure, you can buy the Blockbuster Pre-Viewed VHS for 8.99 and watch it once every six years until it turns to dust or gets lost in the next move, but DVDs, man...you have to watch the flick more than once to get into it, get the whole picture.  I think that's the point.  You have to want to know more about the artists and the craft than just watch a parade of light and shadow on a screen.  You want to know how and why this picture was made.  &quot;Clerks&quot; is a perfect movie for this purpose.<br />The commentary track is made during the filming of Mallrats, where none of the cast or crew really know how the second of the five &quot;Jersey&quot; films would gross or play to the audience.  Its a time of innocence and excitement for Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier and the View Askew crew as they talk up their great, groundbreaking film.  There is none of the resentment or bad ju-ju you can hear in the &quot;Mallrats&quot; or &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; commentaries about how the critics were overly harsh with it.  There is just joy in the idea that &quot;Clerks&quot; did so well and that, though changes were made, it was all for the best.  Only with DVD can you go back and hear Smith and Mosier &quot;back in the day&quot; like this and compare it to today.  Their honesty and frankness make the track work.<br />In addition, it is great to be able to see the lost scenes of Clerks, even if you agree they don't really add to the film.  They are extra bits of coolness to enjoy while waiting for &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; to hit theaters for new material.  The video for &quot;Can't Even Tell&quot; is the first time, I believe, you get to see the Clerks crew in color as well...a little bit of Askew history there, too.<br />Great work and a wonderful time capsule for one of our generation's greatest writers.
0792838637|5.0|&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; is one of those Bond films that people love or hate.  For me, as an HK action fan, it was an important movie because it introduced Michelle Yeoh and she did a fantastic job in the movie and worked well with Brosnan.  So, I may be a bit biased with this movie, so I will talk about the DVD instead.<br />You are probably looking at this DVD and saying to yourself, &quot;I never seen this DVD before?&quot;.  Well, this DVD was offered back in 1998 and was a limited special edition release.  It is very hard to find and if you can find one version of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, look for the Special Edition with the gray cover.<br />This DVD version is seriosly packed with special features. Actually, dedicated more for the hard core James Bond fan.  The special features include a commentary by the director, stuunt director, producer, storyboards, concepts, 45 minute &quot;Secrets of 007&quot; featurette, music video, digital effects reel, music-only track with the composer, 12-page booklet, trailers and more.<br />The DVD looks great and the sound is awesome!  This is one of the early DVD releases that got a lot of recognition because it was packed with special features when most studios released DVD's bareboned.<br />So, if you can find this special edition release, congratulations...you own one heck of a collector's DVD.<br />Special Edition version of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (Gray Cover) is highly recommended!
B00003CXRP|5.0|I loved CAST AWAY. It's a facinating film about one man (Tom Hanks) leaving his home to go on a plane only to find himself stranded on a deserted island for four years. From beginning 'til the end, you are engrossed to discovering what happpens to Hanks' character. I loved every moment of this film, and Hanks definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. I mean, what's so great about Russell Crowe?! I didn't even really like GLADIATOR all that much. Also, the special effects in this film are just specatular and the storyline is solid and strong. I don't know why but for some reason this film reminds me of THE PERFECT STORM (maybe it's because both have to do with disasters at sea). But this is one film I definitely recommend. I didn't catch it in the theaters, unfortunately. But I watched it on VHS and thought it was just as superb! A must-see.
B00003CX97|5.0|What prompted me to buy this movie is the fact that it had won 7 Oscars and it was listed on the American Film Institute's #11 best movies of all time.  There are two DVD versions in the market.  The regular version and the limited edition.  I opted for the latter despite the cost because if this is a &quot;very good movie&quot;, I wanted to be treated with whatever was on that second DVD and I'm happy to say that this is one hell of a movie!<br />I don't think today's movies can do what was done on &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.  It's even hard to believe that this movie was made with a two million dollar budget.  The movie is brilliant as it tackles two major storylines between two leaders Colonel Nicholson for the English and Colonel Saito for the Japanese.  Two fanatics + another (the commando / British Major) who comes later in the story.<br />The movie was brilliantly done and for a movie that was made in 1957, the video was very nice and it's letterboxed and in digital 5.1.  You can hear the insects and birds all around you.<br />After you are done with the movie, you are then treated with the nearly an hour documentary on the film which is filled with interesting tidbits such as the problems of making the film to learning how demanding the director was.  Very interesting.  Also, an appreciation of the film by John Milius (director of &quot;Big Wednesday).  The original B&amp;W featurette,  a short USC film narrated by William Holden, movie trailers for other movies by the Spiegel/Lean duo, cast information and more.<br />This is an awesome DVD.  Highly recommended!
6305074364|3.0|Romance author Paul Sheldon (James Caan) longs for parting with Misery. Sheldon's plucky heroine of seven novels has delivered Sheldon fame and fortune and recognition beyond the average writer's dreams, but she is also interminably linked to him. Determined to escape an eternal role as dimestore novelist, he kills her off in the eighth novel and heads to his New England cabin to work on his own Great American Novel. Upon completion, Sheldon excitedly sets out for his New York City publisher in the midst of a raging blizzard and within minutes veers into a desolate snowbank. From the brink of death, he is rescued from the snow by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who just so happens to be Misery's self-professed biggest fan. At first, she nurses him back to health in her remote cabin, telling him the roads and phones are knocked out by the storm, fawning over his literary accomplishments. However, things change when she purchases his eighth Misery book and reaches the point of Misery's death. Annie's psychotic underbelly swiftly surfaces as the unfortunate author is held clandestinely captive in her home. Meanwhile, a wily small-town sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) circles in....<br />Director Rob Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's novel is an eerie tale of obsessiveness and isolation. The film features an excellent turn by Caan and an Oscar-winning performance by Bates. <br />Watch MISERY for a load of suspense and thrills that will have you begging for more. This is a great thriller and shouldn't be missed by any Stephen King fan. He's a great writer and Rob Reiner is an awesome director. The acting is also extremly great.<br />I wouldn't call this a horror movie, but any horror fan would just love this one. The scenes ares so brutal, that when Kathy Bates breaks James Caan's legs you can feel the pain he's going through.<br />Rent this film. It's excellent. You won't regret it.<br />I hope my review was helpful to you!
6305232660|4.0|I have been wanting to watch this movie for so long and now that I have seen it, here are few things that came to mind.<br />First, knowing that this movie and &quot;Armageddon&quot; were both going to be compared because they came out the same year and nearly the same time about the same topic, &quot;Armageddon&quot; is more action based and focusing about people trying to save the Earth.  &quot;Deep Impact&quot; is somewhat the same but focuses more about people and their last days on Earth and impending doom.  It focused on people and their emotions more than action.<br />I really enjoyed the movie and there are a lot of popular people in this film which is a plus.  The acting was good but Tea Leoni...I like her a lot but her acting in this movie was not at all involving and emotional.  I really couldn't care less for her character because of the acting.<br />I'm glad this movie is different from &quot;Armageddon&quot; because it would lose if it was an action film.  You need action stars like Bruce Willis but in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; our heroes in Robert Duvall, Blair Underwood and others were still good to watch and again, this movie is about saving the world but knowing that doom is ahead.<br />The video was very colorful and beautiful.  The sound was awesome but I believe I got more out of my 5.1 in &quot;Armageddon&quot; but that doesn't mean &quot;Deep Impact&quot; is a slouch because it sounds good!<br />As for special features, just only a teaser trailer and the theatrical trailer.  I'm sure they could of added more to this DVD and that was the only thing I was bummed out about.<br />Otherwise a very good movie!
B000002JB8|5.0|No other talk,just go and buy that cd,it is the greatest music,so relaxing and emotional. Especially &quot;fields of coral&quot;,&quot;aquatic dance&quot; and &quot;siren's whispering&quot; are mind blowing.
B00003CXAR|5.0|This movie is a classic and the mother of all sea animals vs. humans.  Sure there has been movies about killer whales, big snakes and other movies with sharks and also other &quot;JAWS&quot; movies but the first movie will always be regarded as the best out there right now.<br />This 25th Anniversary DVD was one of the most highly anticipated DVD's out there.  Of course, there was a debate because although the movie won an Academy for best sound, purists cried foul when they heard the movie would be released in DTS and Digital Dolby instead of Mono.  Well, I prefer to watch my DVD's in the best sound as possible including this movie and thus the DTS version is the way to go.  You literally feel that you are swimming in the beach with the splashes heard all around you.  It's awesome!  So, the audio is great and the movie looks pretty good despite the fact that it has been 25 years.<br />Also, this DVD is packed!  You get the documentary of &quot;The Making of Jaws&quot;, deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards and so much more that this DVD will keep you busy for the weekend.<br />A highly recommended DVD!

B00001PE4D|4.0|This movie is an adaptation of the novel &quot;Les Liasons Dangereuse&quot; (Dangerous Liasons).  Some may find this as a movie featuring today's young stars with Buffy's Gellar (Katherine) and young star Ryan Phillippe (Sebastian) and I think that's what makes this movie so appealing.<br />Yes, it's a bit twisted and over-the-top but it's entertaining to see a mega playboy who likes to have sex with girls and leave them and an ice queen who is just plainly a Queen B go against each other in a challenge for Sebastian's car or for Sebastian to do his step-sister, the only girl he can't have.  Interesting concept, interesting story.  Also, the other side characters are really fun to watch.<br />First, hats of to Roger Kumble for fighting for his film crew and also believing in his movie.  That's important.<br />Second, the DVD features really cool video (they got a talented cinematographer to work on this Indie-&gt;go popular film) and audio was assisted by the cool music throughout this movie.  As for special features, the two featurettes were very cool.  Learning about how clothing and colors were important to this movie was interesting to watch.  The deleted scenes were best kept cut.<br />The main premise of this movie is to watch a young, sex crazy guy with no care in the world but for himself goes from being a punk to a guy who finally falls in love and cares for the girl that he's betting on.<br />An interesting movie and a good DVD.

630439845X|5.0|I own this movie and have watched it many times and have cried many times. A friend once asked me what my favorite part was and was quite stunned when i told him the part where Hollie Hunter's &quot;husband&quot; chopped off her finger. I told him it was because of the passion....the passion of the raging storm and the passions raging inside of the actors. Which, i believe were very well portrayed by all of the cast. I'm sure you've guessed by now that i am a very passionate person and i have a love of music, as well. This movied touched me tremendously....it portrayed passion to the extreme.  It was a bit of softcore porn....but it was more erotic softcore porn. It was lovely and beautiful in the way it was portrayed. If you want to understand the true measure of a persons' loves...then i highly recommend owning this movie!!
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis, without question, is the most influential musician of the latter half of the twentieth century.  This, his greatest album, features yet another influential musician--saxophonist John Coletrane, who sweeps us away with his wistful melodies.  Picture yourself on a rainy morning listening to this album.  Or perhaps on a secluded beach.  Or while you cruise around in your ride.  Wherever you are, and whatever you find yourself doing,  &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; is the record for you.
B000002H8F|5.0|Whenever people talk about the Pixies,they usually fail to note how pretty they can be.Sure,lead vocalist Black Francis(ne Frank Black) could shred dry-wall with his caustic wail,but when he wants to,he can come up with some disarmingly sweet melodies,and deliver them with heart and sensitivity,and this was never more evident that on &quot;Bossanova&quot;.After the opening one-two punch of &quot;Ceclia Anne&quot;(surf-sufari meets The Clash)and &quot;Rock Music&quot;(a song Kurt Cobain obviously listened to a LOT),we get to &quot;Velouria&quot;,an etherial ode to a celestial muse,with a theramin stoked melody arching skyward for four blissful minutes.&quot;Ana&quot; is similarly geougeous,with a smooth,loungy feel and epic atmospherics.Speaking of epics,&quot;All Over The World&quot; is one and then some,a massive multi-part travelogue with one of the most spine-tinglingly inventive codas ever recorded.It's my favorite Pixies song.Also &quot;the happening&quot;,which would make a great song to put in an &quot;X-Files&quot; episode,also makes beauty and grace out of what is essentially avant-blues grind.What a shame these incredibally talented and creative musicians weren't around longer,but at least they left behind this and three other great testaments to thier genious.
6305428352|5.0|A great, great movie about: teaching, [great] music,  being patient and dedicated to something you believe in, being a father, a husband, and a caring person.   I took a dozen good friends and relatives to see it with me! Treat yourself to feeling good and watch it.
B000003CMC|5.0|I think some of you are getting the wrong idea when you talk about critics comparing the ABB with the Grateful Dead.  The critics that you speak of are not comparing the groups musically (and I think a Dead fan would be insulted as well), but speaking of both bands' ability to attract a large following of fans.
B00005B534|5.0|The comparisons to Symphony X are inevitable for this band.  They combine progressive leanings, classical structures and interludes with metal much like their New Jersey forerunners.  However the feeling is much darker.  Overall I don't think their songs are as well developed or the vocals as powerful, but this is still 5 star material.  Stephen Forte is an absolute monster on the guitar...he plays a lot of Michael Romeo style runs ie. blindingly fast with a lot of intricate tapping and weird atonal stuff.  He tends to do longer runs in the vein of Romeo's Dark Chapter or early Symphony X stuff.  It is a little more superfluous or excessive but I like that.  However, his rhythm playing isn't quite up to par with Romeo's IMO.  The rest of the instruments are played at virtuoso levels as well (especially the keys).  An excellent first cd and I look forward to follow up releases by this band.
B000002WPI|4.0|This CD is great. it has that 93 jazz feel to it that makes hip hop great. Pretty much all the songs are tight expt maybe like 1 or 2 but those arn't to bad. A must have for a hip hop head.
0385121679|5.0|This is my favorite Stephen King novel.  I love the way he lets the reader live the lives of each character, and shares with us the nightmares (than become realities) each one faces.  &quot;The Shining&quot; is a story of a haunted hotel entraping a small hometown family.  Great horror story, scary, exciting, and mysterious. Keep this one &quot;Out of Reach of Children&quot;, very spooky. Never a dull moment.
6303314015|5.0|The Lion King, to me is one of the greatest films I have seen. Usually when you think of of a disney movie, you would think it is directed towards younger kids, but the Lion King would be absolutely enjoyable for all ages. It is one of the more instense Disney films I have seen. From the fantastic opening music, and then to the powerful climatic scene, it kept me entertained all night long when I first saw it. The music is spectuacular! It's hard to pick out a favorite song. The cast for the voices are the best I've seen. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I am 16 now and I still love the movie. I just have one question. When will The Lion King be released on DVD????? The Little Mermaid was made around then and it is released. I don't know about Beauty and the Beast, but ALADDIN and THE LION KING are STILL not released!!!! Two of the most popular Disney movies of all time! DVD is the best way to watch it and I would certainly like watching the greatest animated movie of all time (in my opinion) on the best possible format (dvd). I only hope they are perfecting it for the DVD version, or are working on it, because I would certainly hate waiting 1 or 2 more years for it to come out.

B000059QY3|5.0|La traviata holds a very precious status in my experiences, from my first hearing with Eleanor Steber and Richard Tucker from a Met visit to Dallas, to two performances of Maria Callas, and two performances of Montserrat Caballe, all four with the Dallas Civic Opera under Nicola Resigno.  Performance-wise, I do not know how Solti's could be bettered, as even Leo Nucci, a somewhat casual singer, deeply involves himself in the Act II confrontation between Violetta and Germont Pere.Angela Gheorghiu immerses herself into Violetta's suffering,leaving every emotional nuance explored tactfully and lyrically.  Added to the physical beauty of the soprano, the voice reflects a lyrical sweetness with spectacular technique.  Her runs in &quot;Sempre libera&quot; are neat, articulate, and dead center, and follows an exquisite reading of &quot;Ah, fors e lui.&quot;  Frank Lopardo, her Alfredo, exhibits a sympathetic understanding of this thankless role, and rewards the spectator with a complete involvement.  The voice itself is quite handsome.  Even Leo Nucci generates fire with the long Act II scene  &quot;Pura siccome un angelo&quot; and &quot;Dite alla giovine&quot;.  Act III pulls out all the emotional and dramatic stops for an overwhelming finale.  But the surprise of surprises is Sir Georg Solti's conducting.  After years of hearing him drive Verdi with the intensity of a late twentieth-century Toscanini, what an unexpected joy to hear this wonderful gentleman lead a performance of great sensitivity and with a laid-back attitude that lets Verdi's lyricism speak with loving non-maudlin sentimentality.  This performance is a must-have, beautifully recorded both visually and aurally.

B00003CXRP|4.0|&quot;Cast Away&quot; is the embodiment of a frequent fantasy of many people to be stranded on a deserted island.  Great concept for a movie, and Tom Hanks was perfectly cast as the cast away.  I doubt that any other actor could have carried the movie - which mostly consists of  just Hanks on the island - so well.  The movie starts with the premise that Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, is a Federal Express executive obsessed with time.  A little obvious but still a nice contrast with his life on the island where time becomes meaningless.  Also, since he's on a Federal Express plane that goes down, several parcels are washed up which provide Chuck with a variety of items he can use try to use in his effort to survive.  By the way, the scenes from the plane crash are particularly well done and seemed very realistic to me (never having been in a plane crash, I can't speak with absolute authority on that).  I can't say enough about how good Hanks' performance was .  Personally, I thought the ending didn't live up to the rest of the movie.  I would have liked to see a little more of his transition back into a world that changed drastically during his absence.  Be sure to watch the &quot;Making of Cast Away&quot; on the DVD.  The story of filming the movie is almost as interesting as the movie itself.
0792101448|5.0|I'm really not into westerns at all, but ever since I caught this on AMC, it's become one of my favorites of all time. Henry Fonda is great in this rare performance as a villain. And that haunting soundtrack, I couldn't get it out of my head the first few times I watched it. What I want to know is who is the wonderful person that is sitting behind their desk looking at a pamphlet to their next vacation spot and not paying attention to getting this film on DVD. Come on! I think you've kept us waiting long enough. GET WITH IT! Thank you.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Tom Hanks gave the best performance of his life in this film. The way the movie interacted with past events really drew me into the movie and made me feel like I was really there. I recommend Forrest Gump to anyone who enjoys a heartwarming but yet, funny movie.
B00003CXRP|4.0|A Fed-Ex workaholic, recently engaged, is the sole survivor of a plane crash and survives on an uninhabited island for four years. This movie, like almost all of today's films, was poorly sold. In the space of a sixty second commercial, not only did they tell you all of the above info-admittedly this is a simple story-they also took out all of the suspense of the movie by spilling the beans about the 3rd Act and the fact that he gets rescued. All that's left to discover is the last 20 minutes. We don't know much about Hanks' character beside the fact that he's a workaholic, and that his life is dictated by the Clock. And this is where the film falls short. By not knowing what kind of man this is, or even what he thinks he is, there is nothing to discover about his transformation,of which there is very little, other than the physical. Sure there is the isolation and the depression to witness and the creation of fire and the finding of food and shelter, but there is a larger protrait missing here. It's the difference between a good film and a great film. Hanks is very, very good here, but without a truely full dimensional character to play, it's Hanks we see on the island, not Chuck Noland. Noland is more of a statistic than a character. An actress of Helen Hunt's stature, and talent, is badly needed because we can plug in bits of her other characterizations into the story to keep her presence alive. Robert Zmeckis is a good director for entertainment films, and he's got taste and class, but this film needed an artist, which Zmeckis is not. And like his other big film FORREST GUMP, you're not sure what,if anything, he's trying to say. Zmeckis is a very external director, so it's no wonder many, many people didn't get the last scene of this film. It feels like a different, and more talented director helmed this scene. It's completely at odds stylistically with the rest of the film. Like the director started using a different film language, is the best way I can explainit.No wonder many people didn't get it. It's more in the style of older foreign language films. I think it's the best scene in the film, and I wish Zmeckis had started filming this movie after shooting this scene instead of the other way 'round....As for the DVD, the DTS sound is superb and the extras at times, do a better job of defining the movie's intentions, than the film itself.
B000002UJQ|5.0|<br /> I hesistate to write this because I am a big Beatles fan ... but I think Radiohead's OK Computer is better than any of the Beatles' albums ... which would, logically, make OK Computer the greatest album ever!<br /><br />The first time I listened to OK Computer, I thought: What the heck is this? But the more I listen to OK Computer, the more I appreciate both its sonic and lyric brilliance as well as its underlying creepiness (no pun intended, forgive me Radiohead fans for the pun).<br /><br />Yeah, we've heard for the last 3 decades of how this or that band is the 'next Beatles.' Well there was only one Beatles ... and I don't think Radiohead qualifies as the next Beatles (maybe if Travis somehow merged with Radiohead ... hmm???). But OK Computer takes all the good stuff in music that came before, pushed the envelope musically, and combined it with contemporary anxieties about the information revolution / globilization.<br /><br />In short, <br /> Do <br /> OK Computer = Best album ever <br /> Loop
B000059QY3|4.0|One of the seven operas on DVD released in June 2001 by Deutsche Grammophon is a &lt;La Traviata&gt; (071 431-9) from a 1995 Covent Garden production. Here Georg Solti leads the Orchestra and Chorus of the Royal Opera House headed by Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu. Critic/commentator Albert Innaurato calls her &quot;the most complete Violetta on video.&quot; Now he did not mean the best vocally or even physically or dramatically; but as a whole, she is the most satisfying.<br />  Where Stratas looks half dead throughout the Zeffirelli film and others simply look too healthy for Act III, Gheorghiu (who, by the way, never had sung this role before!) manages to look fragile at her own party, stunning all in black at Flora's, and &quot;at death's door&quot; in her squalid apartment, the walls of which seem to ascend forever toward heaven.<br />  Tenor Frank Lopardo has some sense of acting his part beyond generalized suffering and is in good voice. The only really jarring notes are the unpleasant makeup of Leo Nucci as the Father and his unpleasant voice, which did not seem to bother the appreciative audience that night. The Gypsy scene, for once, did not work too well, nor did the camping up of the Spanish number, unless one considers it part of the decadence of the world the heroine will soon be leaving.<br />  The scenery for the first act seemed unnecessarily cramped, a little rest area in Violetta's much larger home; but the unfinished state of the country home was just right. Were those pictures leaning against the wall waiting to be put up or taken away for sale? And the little swatches of wallpaper on the molding were a good touch. The shadows of the carnival revelers through the slats of the Act III scenery was also effective.<br />  Now and then, the voices would fade away as if too far from a microphone; and then the sound would swell up so suddenly that I kept diving for the volume control. Was this an engineering problem or did it sound like that in the theater? The audience is absolutely silent, keeping applause and cheers for the curtain calls.<br />  All things considered, this set is very worth having for the Violetta alone.<br />  The DVD runs 135 minutes in the 4:3 screen ratio with subtitles in English, French, German, and Chinese.n the theater?

0385493622|5.0|<br /> This has to be the best book on math and science ever (note: I haven't read Simon Singh's Code Book yet). This book will make you fall in love with abstract math ... and you don't even have to be a nerd to feel that way ... although it helps ;) <br /><br />Simon Singh somehow manages to explain difficult techincal concepts in a a step-by-step way that is both accessible WITHOUT being too 'dumbed down.' Most 'laymen's books' on science are too inaccessible, too dumbed down, or too much of both! All I can say to Simon Singh (a guy who studied Physics at Cambridge in the UK) is a very British BRILLIANT!!!<br /><br />One helpful hint though ... for those who really loved this book ... I would recommend going to the amazon web site in the uk, and getting the British version of this book. Why? For some strange reason, the American publishers decided to leave some parts out that were in the British (the original) edition of the book. I think most of the material that was left out dealt with Bertrand Russell (and Whitehead???) as well as some additional insights on the future of mathematics. I highly recommend that option for those who don't want to miss out on what was left out.
B00003BDXG|4.0|I guess almost everyone missed the point Stone was trying to make here. Social Satire! He pokes fun at everything in sight, from the exagerated actions of our two anti-heroes (Harrelson &amp; Lewis), the hypocrisy of rating-hungry sensationalistic &quot;tv&quot; reporters (Downey), to the justice system and the corrupt fools who run it, to law enforcement in general, even to the capture scene with the police resorting to barbaric measures for no reason whatsoever! Not to mention a miniscule supporting roll for Dangerfield that was worthy of an Academy Award in my book! No, I am not a sick person who laughs at car accidents or mass-murder, nor do I condone the actions of Harrelson and Lewis as socially acceptable. I just enjoy a great flick, and this is one!
B000003N7G|5.0|This is as fine example of jazz that exists on a recording. I have heard a few that may equal, but none to surpass. There are not enough stars in this rating system to &quot;rate&quot; this  performance and the contents of this performance
B00005B4GU|5.0|Though &quot;Push/Pulk Revolving Doors&quot; is probably the craziest thing Radiohead has ever done, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; stands as the missing evolutionary step between &quot;Ok Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot;. This means that it has more guitars, more &quot;song&quot;, and sounds a little more natural.<br />Since I both loved &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot;, Amnesiac is a no brainer, especially since it mends two styles without repeating the songs. Other bands could learn a lot from Radiohead.<br />If &quot;Kid A&quot; was a little too extreme for you, give &quot;Amnesiac&quot; a try.
B00005B7CK|5.0|I was dragged to this movie, expecting it to be a predictable cornpone parody of southern life.  Instead of being boring, the story was brilliant in dialoge, humor, and music.

1881273156|5.0|This book changed my life and everyone around me who got given a copy.  And they in turn gave out copies to their friends etc. It is SO powerful.  After much frustration - my ex husband and I figured out where we had both been at in regards to each other.  Due to many things we chose to be friends instead of partners.  But this book really showed us what had been happening.  He was physical touch in 1st mode and I am quality time.  And as one person didn't get their quota filled, the other would not fill the quota also.  It went round and round in circles.<br />My new man is a quality time person like me and this is SO... nice..  I am 'words of affirmation' in 2nd mode and he is 'acts of service'.  This is so helpful in getting both our needs met. I have used this with friends too.  My best friend and I are opposite modes. She is 'acts of service' in 1st.  And I am 'quality time'.  Both of these things being our #5 modes for each other.  We nearly ended the friendship because of it.  Neither thinking the other one cared very much.  So, now we both know what to do for each other to feel valued. <br />I can't say enough about this book.  It changes every relationship you have ever had or will have.  It's brilliant
B000002LUB|5.0|After 1990's lackluster Tyr from Sabbath, and Dio's completely unsalvageable Lock Up the Wolves from the same year, Ronnie reunited with his former Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Vinny Appice to record what became Dehumanizer, an effort that sounded like it was recorded six months after 1981's Mob Rules.<br />Track after track, Dehumanizer pumps out metal with a modern sound, while sticking firmly to old school roots.  Without Dio monopolizing the lyric writing duties, the lyrical content is more diverse than on _Heaven and Hell_ and _Mob Rules_, featuring anti-technology bile that hints at Geezer (&quot;Computer God&quot;), as well as stuff you'd expect from Dio. (All author's speculation--as always with Sabbath, they don't tell us who wrote what.)<br />Dehumanizer is recommendable to anyone who likes Black Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio, old school speed metal...Any quality metal, really.  This album is one my favorite Black Sabbath records (out of eighteen), and frankly it's a shame to see it reduced to cut out bin price here at Amazon (as of this writing).  Buy it! :)
B00005B4GU|4.0|As a religious Radiohead fan I can and should be accused of bias when reviewing Radiohead's latest album. But the honest truth is I had a very cautious approach to this album when I first read that Radiohead put these tracks down while in session for Kid A. I didn't want an album of B sides. I'd rather buy them as EPs or Singles and enjoy them as the hit and miss gems that Radiohead's extra efforts usually turn out to be.<br />On my first listen I found the music a bit disorienting; unable to feel like the tunes belonged with Kid A or Radiohead's triumph, OK Computer. After a few listens I declared that I loved this album. After a few more, I decided it was only a marginal effort (which is a darn good one for any other band), placing it just ahead of Itch in my mind as Radiohead's best albums and sadly in the 4th position.<br />And then a few things happened. First, I recorded the tracks to a digital hand held and played the repeatedly and often. The music began to take shape and I heard the melodies and Thom's lyrics with more conviction. Songs like Pyramid Song and You and Whose Army? slowly started to blow me away. The crescendo of music and emotion seemed well-timed and complex, taking me back to the feelings you get with OK Computer. The revisit to Morning Bell showed me that Radiohead was still exploring with their sound, even with tracks they had just recorded during Kid A sessions. Morning Bell was my favorite track from Kid A and yet it seemed perfectly fine to get a varied, calmer version on Amnesiac. Other tracks, assured me that Radiohead was still Radiohead with tracks like I Might Be Wrong giving ample doses of smooth guitar riffs.<br />Secondly, I saw Radiohead perform many of these live. The level of complex sounds, from traditional symphonic instruments to high tech gadgetry was all over their performance and their mood. It was electrifying. The band had taken its angst about technology so clearly defined in OK Computer and flipped it back on itself, bridging simple traditional sounds (piano, cello) with out of this world screams that only a computer itself could generate. From there, I could see the album as a logical extension of Radiohead's work to date and put Amnesiac safely in its spot as a very strong #2 or #3 with Kid A being either better or worse depending on the day (i.e., too close to call).<br />All in all this album is not Kid A: Side B; and it isn't quite the same dreamy and untethered album that Kid A was either. To compare them is somehow not appropriate; they are of the same time and place, just different tones on the same color and to borrow from the vernacular these days, &quot;its all good.&quot;
B00000K0DT|5.0|Story: so complex it'll turn off less inteligent viewers. If you don't quite get it, find the screenplay on the web and read it. Some plot points are clearer, but it's good they left them out. Why? It works better without emphasizing them, just letting them linger in the background somewhere...<br />Direction: by Bryan Singer. Say no more. Visual genius.<br />Performances: cool, slick, yet believable.<br />Movie itself: in a word, perfect!<br />But, there is a man whose acomplishment is overlooked when praising this movie. His name is John Ottman, and he did montage and wrote music for the film, which has given a movie such rhythm and (tense) atmosphere that it's a crying shame he didn't receive an Oscar. Beautiful work, John!<br />By the way, it's one of mine Top 3 movies of all time...
6304233639|4.0|This was a blockbuster movie on the big screen, not to mention being one of the largest grossing films in the last ten years.  It's outrageously unbelievable, but that's what films like this are supposed to be.  This home video is an excellent buy.<br />Alien spaceships position themselves around the world, and lay attack on civilization as we know it.  The United States leads the revenge attack on these seemingly immovable and undefeatable aliens.  Throw in some amazing special effects, an incredibly inspirational speech by the President, a sexy, yet seemingly out-of-place exotic dance scene, and the comedic acting of superstar Will Smith, and you have one really enjoyable film.<br />The special effect were truly remarkable, and complimented nicely with a good sound.  The acting, for the most part, was good.  Will Smith was truly perfect in his role, with outstanding timing, and the perfect mix of humor and seriousness.  Bill Pullman played a sensational president, and his &quot;Independence Day&quot; speech was nothing short of spectacular.  You cannot help but be moved and inspired by his candid words.  Jeff Goldblum also added in a good performance as the scientist trying to &quot;save the planet,&quot; and Judd Hirsch was super as his hilarious, witty father.<br />Overall, this was a good film, guaranteed to bring you a couple of hours of entertainment.  The storyline, although a little far-fetched, keeps the viewer intrigued right through to Randy Quaid's heroic performance at the end.  This film will make you cheer out loud.
B000003TAW|5.0|who doesn't love weezer? when they came out they were like the alternative to alternative. the anti- rock stars. but mostly, they're just a bunch of cute geeky guys playing great music. the songs on this album are both heartbreakingly tender and insanely catchy, but it is also legimate rockandroll. weezer unknowingly made being uncool cool.
0800179501|2.0|First major disappointment (my fault, I bought it as a gift for my husband, and should have read more carefully) is that it is panned and scanned.  Second major disappointment is that there are NO special features at all (I know, we're getting spoiled). Audio selection is also limited.  I might has well have purchased the video.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent use of music as part of the story.   While not really a musical, it definitely uses music to speak for the characters and to seamlessly advance the storyline (instead of the typical &quot;plot-on-pause&quot; of most musicals as they get the song over with).  George Clooney was extremely sharp as Ulysses and the rest of the cast made for some very memorable moments, too numerous to mention.  A unique movie in that I can recommend it to my friends and the soundtrack to my dad........
0380973650|5.0|Neil Gaiman was introduced to me in a world of magic and the London Underground with his intelligent opus, Neverwhere.  He has once again created a world so similar to our own that it is easy to get the two confused.  American Gods is a mature and informed novel that is sentimental and disturbing, both comforting and terrifying, and altogether well written.  Gaiman does all the things one would expect from the brilliant writer.  He weaves tales together while keeping suspense high and his places and narratives in order.  His characters, from protagonist/anti-hero Shadow to Wednesday (Shadow's employer) to wife Laura to a host of unknown and forgotten gods, are so real and so life-like that I expect to run into them in life.  Gaiman has told their story with dignity and has captured their longing and their passion.  To say anything about the story would be a spoiler, so I will just say that everything works itself into the story and it's a pleasure to see how Gaiman conducts this tale.  I think that this story is even more appreciated if you have read Gaiman before, albeit in novel or comic form.  It always amazes me how he writes like he writing for a comic, but this novel begins to move away from that.  It is certainly an impressive and formidable book that I recommend to any fantasy fans or anyone interested in a good, exceptionally believable story.
B00001NFCY|4.0|Creed return with their second effort, after their titanic debut release My Own Prison.  Creed avoids the sophomore slump as if it were a pile of dog crap; a feat a lot of bands can't pull off.<br />Human Clay can contribute its commercial success to Creed's accomplishment of writing hit songs that transcend musical boundaries; something My Own Prison couldn't do.  The pure emotion of 'With Arms Wide Open' and Creed's lighter rocking side with 'Higher' can be heard everywhere from Alternative Rock Radio to Top 40 Radio to Light Rock Radio, expanding Creed's audience to people that might previously have not heard their music.  Granted that My Own Prison was a blockbuster release, this CD had the hype and the songs behind it right from it's release.<br />You have the massive radio hits, then you get into, what I think is the best song on the CD, 'What If'.  It's heaviness and anger cannot be met by any song on the CD.  'Are You Ready?' is another good song up until Scott Stapp starts to count in the chorus.  I found these lyrics annoying and unimaginitive.  The rest of the song really rocks, though.  <br />'Wrong Way' starts with some eerie notes then gets angry quick.  Another great song.  This song appears on the End Of Days Soundtrack.  'Say I' goes from heavy to eerie and then back again, several times throughout the song.  The verses feature some really great lyrics.  'Never Die' is a song with the same styling as 'Say I'.  However, the music and lyrics are not as strong as 'Say I'.<br />In general, this CD is a lot more formulaic and follows guidelines, unlike My Own Prison.  Each songs seems to follow the same kind of pattern.  One thing that could be improved upon, is that it doesn't seem like Creed is experimenting with its sound much.  The guitar tone on all of the arpeggios is the same and if it wasn't for the interesting progressions, this would get boring fast.  <br />But, when Human Clay is heavy, it's really heavy; moreso than My Own Prison.  In it's lighter moments, there are arpeggiated rhythms.  At times it is a beautiful CD, at others it is a rage fueled machine.  It's a very emotion filled listen that takes you through a lot of ups and downs.<br />If you just can't get your fill of Creed, check out the Scream 3 Soundtrack.  Creed produced it and 'What If' appears there as well as an unreleased song 'Is This The End'.  This song is an epic, but is an excellent listen; well worth the money for the CD itself.  Check it out!
B00005KARK|4.0|I found this in the back of a closet and decided to watch it again. It had been such a long time since I had watched it. I loved the songs. The songs were as classic as the ones in Cinderella and Peter Pan. It's too bad that Disney ran out of Fairytales. Because this movie and most of his earlier movies were some of the better ones. I don't know about you but this movie was so sad at some points. I remember crying when Dumbo was being teased, and when his mom and him were separated. Anyone of any age will be touched by the scenes in this movie. I was, and I'm thirteen.You will surely love this movie as I do.
6304711875|5.0|I admit that I didn't see this movie when it first came out, as I wasn't interested in it.  But then I began to hear how popular it was--not to mention how cute all the actresses were--so I decided to give it a try.  Reluctantly, at first.  But I was hooked at the opening moment.  We're talking a thriller filled with horror, suspense, action, and humor, combining it all into a great movie.  Neve Cambell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox are a great team, and make the sequels excellent, as well.  Sydney Prescott (Cambell) is at the center of a series of gruesome murders.  She is a young woman with several skeletons in her closet, the doors ready to be opened by reporter Gale Weathers (Cox) who is in town to cover the murders.  Sydney's past and present collide when her boyfriend is the suspected killer, and yet the murders continue.  Officer Dewey (Arquette), a not-so-hip cop who has a crush on Sydney, begins to fall in love with Weathers, and still the bodies pile up.  Try to guess who dunnit, and then try to stay in your seat as the climax approaches.  An engrossing thriller from the master of the genre, featuring a talented cast and an intriguing plot.  Don't miss it!
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz is the best CD of the year, bar-none. It's a refreshing sound I've been yearning for for the longest time. I was getting real sick of all the crap that I've been hearing, and I'm glad to know that there is a group of people out there who have the guts and brains to do this type of music. Despite who's in the band, they might as well just be totally nameless people, for all I care, the ingenious music speaks for itself. There are so many good songs on this record...Punk, Starshine, M1A1, Double Bass, Tomorrow Comes Today, Slow Country...these are all wonderfully crafted songs. The only lament I am making is that Rock the House is on the CD. Its riff is cool, but the lyrics seem kind of bland. Other than that, this is a top-notch CD that will blow away any of that other crap you hear anywhere.
0783225903|2.0|Highly dissapointing Orwellian, Quasi-futuristic film. The story revolves around a homosexual romance between Sam &amp; 'Jill'. A witness to an arrest due to false identity, 'Jill' is forced to run from law enforcement officials and is aided by his homosexual lover, Sam. This film shows sparks of creativity here and there, but will ultimately just deprive you of 2 1/2 hours you could have put to better use.
B000002N3N|5.0|One may wish that lyricist Roma Ryan cut on her use of word heaven (3 times in 'China Roses', twice in 'Pax Deorum' and 'Athair ar Neamh' (translations) and once each in 'Anywhere is','Hope has a place' and 'On my way home'). Having said that, Enya continues to produce quality new age music with a perfect blend of masjectic, flowing layered vocals. One may identify 'Pax Deorum' and perhaps 'La sonadora' with her previous works like 'Cursum perficio','Storms in Africa' and 'The Celts'; all these possess a certain assertiveness, and what i can only describe as a darker shade of Enya's music. As with all Enya albums you will like most of this albums' tracks at one time or another, but I would listen to 'On my way home' more often. Also, instrumentals 'Tea house moon' and 'Memory of trees' would be my picks. You can almost feel yourself sitting out on a summer house patio, snapping your fingers with 'Tea house moon'. The album does not beat either 'Watermark' or the hits collection 'Paint the sky with stars' but is an essential buy for any new age fan.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|Mmaaan... they left the meat out of the sandwich. I might as well be ordering myself the vegetarian. It should go like this, song after song, just like the movie, front to back. After I saw the movie once not including the times after, I said to myself, &quot;This is the best moive I'v seen since, William Shakespears A Midsummer's Night Dream.&quot; And I saw that one, well God knows how many times, but the morall of this story is that I loved everything about the movie, especially the songs that I can't beg for somthing that isn't available so I'll take what I can have and wish that all songs will come later on one nice compact CD that I can play over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over until it gets so hot inside my player that they become one with the exsistance of all living stuff!          Wwwoowww, what ever that meant? I don't know what came over me. I just phayz-owt sometimes mmaann. heh... Oh well, it sounded cool anyways. heh!
B00000J2KX|4.0|Hmmm,  I don't know where to start. It was nothing that i expected,  which was . . . horror in the traditional sense.   The movie horror.   This is taking horror, and tossing it,  making it realilistic,  something to relate to,  believe in,  instead of something to mock.   Horror's in the movie world have all been alike,  until i saw this.   It's that, it's not overdone.   Such a small amount of oddness to not push you away. So many elements working to create this . . world.  <br />And, nothing was overdone. Everything seemed to have just the amount needed to work. Just the right place.   That, that in itself was odd.   That i was thinking about what it took to make this movie,  while watching the movie.   Because you don't catch it often.<br />'happiness'-- The character marla trumph plays.   How smooth and crisp and unreal she is.   How perfect she comes across.   In such an unreal way.   That is like the feeling i had with parts of this movie.   Where something is just . . too right.   So that, in itself, it's eerie.   The whole movie was strange.   It's almost taking a dark comedy, and making it a horror.   And i hate horror movies,  in their traditional sense<br />i had to revise this.  add capitalizations, more commas, and periods.  if it sounds cruddy, well, i expect it.    i'm sending it anyway
B00004STPT|5.0|What an amazing CD! You are able to see the whole movie again in your head whenever you listen to the music. You can feel the victory and the end of \\"The Battle.\\" You can feel the sorrow in \\"Now We Are Free.\\" Truely an amazing soundtrack! Very well conducted and the vocals fit the scene perfectly. This is simply a must buy! -VR
B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD is one of my new all time favorites. What a talent India is and will be I am sure on future CD's!! Her songs and lyrical and addicting- moving your soul rhythm and class. &quot;Video&quot; should be made into an anthem for young and old women alike- it's lyrics teach us to stop comparing ourselves to others and find the vision we look at daily a sign a beauty within ourselves!! &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot; is another song highly recommended. India I applaud you for your ability to merge soulful music with lyrics as beautiful as poetry!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Never heard of Rufus Wainwright until on the Moulin Rouge and Shrek soundtracks....and this discovery of him on his own album Poses is a gem of a find...<br /><br />The album opens with Rufus' sexy and laid-back vocals on Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk. Greek Song follows and surprisingly, it reeks of ancient &amp; majestic Chinese music... California is one the more upbeat songs on the album where Rufus sings of his own decadence, but who cares when you have a voice, a face and a father like him.<br /><br />Armed with a bevy of top-notch producers, Pierre Marchand (Rufus Wainwright, Sarah McLachlan), Alex Gifford (of the electronic duo Propellerheads), Ethan Johns (Emmylou Harris, Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams), Greg Wells (Creeper Lagoon, Crash Test Dummies) and noted contemporary composer Damian le Gassick (K.D Lang, Madonna), the album contains songs of various different moods, ranging from simple ballads to folk rock and even near-theater type songs...<br /><br />Kudos to this young singer-songwriter...check out his debut too!
0805062971|5.0|Not to knock the movie (it's a great movie and I'll probably review it next) but wow, was the ending better in the book, or what?   Now there are things you cannot do in movies without being too vile... i.e. the little plastic baggies in the fridge... or too obscene ... i.e. Marla's post-coital (sp?) comments, but those things are really great punches in the book that the film left out.  But what can you do?  The book ending might be a little too intellectual for a lot of movie-goers who like to have the lights come up and move on with their lives without thinking about what they've just seen.  (Please see &quot;A.I.&quot; and my &quot;A.I.&quot; review if you are not one of those.<br />Other people might get irritated by the book's tendency to repeat itself.  But since most everything in &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a mantra, it must be repeated.  I found both this book and movie to be stunning in their treatment of the postmodern condition.  If you have seen the movie and found it &quot;too disturbing&quot; I highly suggest you stay far far away from the book.  Go read something tamer.  This book is wild and shocking.  I found it interesting how the film delayed the climax in comparison to the book.  I also find myself wondering how I would have pictured the characters if I didn't have Edward Norton and Brad Pitt stuck in my head.  And if Helena Bonham Carter is not the perfect Marla, I don't know who is.  And Robert Paulson?  Enough said.<br />If you loved the movie, you'll probably love the book.  It is an extremely quick read.  I read it in only a few hours and really enjoyed myself in the process.
B000021XS0|5.0|Two years earlier,when I bought the DT's latest album &quot;Metropolis Pt.2:Scenes from a Memory&quot;.I hope it would be better than &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot; cuz that previous work had not satisfied me so.Then I put it into my walkman,the metronome started ticking til the record's noise was blown.The complex rhythms,the beautiful melodies and the tender voices of this album is all impressed me much more than another album I've ever heard.And the content in it,seems like belief in Buddhism and as the Hypnotherapist in the story says &quot;Death is not the end but only a transition&quot; and Nicholas sings &quot;The spirit carries on&quot;,this content will enlighten your knowledge about your life.I hope DT's fans and you all will enjoy listening to this album like me.You'll feel love it more than any album that you've ever known.DT is shown more shining light of  thier unlimited successful career to all of us.
B0000549B0|1.0|Whomever colorized this classic should be executed post haste. I almost clicked buy when I saw it was &quot;Color&quot;. No way I would ever let this into my collection. Please, please never buy a colorized classic as you will become just a shill for the sham &quot;artists&quot;.
1577311523|5.0|Attracted by exciting reviews, I bought and read the book. I was so impressed that I bought the tapes. I have been listening to them over and over again every morning for several months. Rather than repeat the wonderful comments of previous reviews, I would like to add a few personal insights. <br />Eckhart's message is very condensed. He compresses a tremendous amount of meaning into a very few simple words. This makes the book very good value for money. You would have to buy and read several similar books by other authors to derive the same quantity of information - but they would probably not match Eckhart's high quality of delivery.<br />Eckhart's messages are deep. A typical sentence has two or three levels of depth that reveal themselves after a number of readings on the conscious level. (On the sub-conscious level you would probably appreciate the deeper meaning immediately). Reflection, and day to day experiences should take you to the deeper levels. However, do not be satisfied with whatever level you have reached. Deeper levels exist. Continue reflecting and seeing day to day events with the new wisdom you have acquired. This will take you deeper still.<br />While you may not agree with all of Eckhart's teachings, you will admit that most of them make sense at a very deep level. After reading this book and listening to the tapes, you will be well on your way to higher levels of consciousness.<br />Buying this book should not be the main consideration, since it is clearly essential reading for everyone. For me the main consideration is how deep do you want to go? I would urge more than one reading. I think you will be pleasantly surprised as each successive reading takes you to new levels of awareness and serenity.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Maybe this is what angels sound like when they're hurting. First, let me explain that I was not weaned on Radiohead.  I've been aware of them, and have been semi-aware of their singles, for a long time, but I could take them or leave them, really.  I recall really digging the video for &quot;Karma Police,&quot; way back when, and thinking, &quot;Okay, maybe they're kinda smart.&quot;  So I had the chance to go see Radiohead live at The Gorge in fabulously named George, WA a little over a week ago and did it.  I decided not to listen to Amnesiac until I'd been to the concert.  What a singular experience.  Their live versions of songs are quite different from their studio versions.  Live or studio, however, both are equally without parallel to much of anything else I've ever heard.  How can such seemingly subtle music manage simultaneous ferrocity?  Like gliding honey spiked with liquor.  The music on Amnesiac (and I'm glad this is the first disc of theirs I've heard all the way through) is dreamy and insistent; a collection of contradictory sonic and lyrical urges that gel astoundingly well.  There are two tracks that seem superfluous to me (&quot;Hunting Bears&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;), which occur side-by-side before the stunning New Orleans-funerary closing track, but this seems a minor complaint given that the rest of the material is simply so fascinating and beautiful.  Amnesiac is one of the few albums I have that I can honestly say becomes more interesting and enjoyable to me with each listen.
B000002LHT|5.0|Disregard everything bad you've heard about this album. It's simply NOT TRUE. Yes, I am a fan of just about everything The Ramones ever did, and yes, this was my first punk album which I got at the tender age of twelve. But those are not the reasons why I like it so much. It's the music, the lyrics, the image, well - The Ramones. And here they are at their 80's best: every song has a hook which will stay in your head for weeks or months (or years, like it happened to me), it's the finest pop music since the Beach Boys or Kinks, yet still there's just enough energy (and The Ramones' &quot;enough&quot; is all other bands' &quot;impossible&quot;). Some songs are as fast as anything they ever did (Learn to Listen, Ignorance Is Bliss), but there's always a hit-record feel because of the melody. Ah well. It's just fantastic and I can't really describe why. Please take my word for it, and buy it: to yourself, to your girlfried, to your kid, to your parents. Everybody will like it (just make sure they're not punk traditionalists who think Ramones sold out with &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;).
B000007T1M|5.0|And it came to be.  Rick Rubin has an exceptional product on his hands, folks.  From the frantic opening guitar into the full-tilt chaos that follows, this album touches many aspects of the rock cube.  &quot;Sugar&quot; is probably the most mr. bungle-ish on the cd and that is not a comparison intending insult.  Mike Patton is a genius and these guys know that.  The eerie and melancholy &quot;Spiders&quot; is a statement of the bands ability to get to you whether it be the hard way or the creepy soft way.  As a whole, there is no blending on this album.  Each song is an entity within itself, and yet they all work together to make that which is System of a Down. Do yourself a favor and at least get a burned copy of this.  Howver you have to get it.... GET IT!  The most energetic, original, talented, artistic, ecclectic and creepy album made in several years.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This film is absolutly, undoubtably the best film i have ever seen! It has something for everyone. Combining Action with adventure, Mystery with Romance, you'll be on the edge of your seats i asure you! I think that Russell Crowe delivers an amazing performance as Maximus, the roman general turned slave gladiator! The score to this film is also a must have, there are two versions of the soundtrack, i have both and they are both excellent. My opinion: Everyone should (MUST) Have a copy of this film. Truly and epic, and it deserves all the Oscar awards it received.
0380977281|4.0|this book was on a required reading list for my school. and i really enjoyed it! it quickly grabbed your interest with the story of dunstan thorn and the market that happens on the other side of Wall, the town he resides in. then, the story picks up with his son, tristran, who is half-mortal. tristan promises the girl he adores that he will bring her back a fallen star. his adventures after he ventures into the land of Faerie, will have you quickly turning the pages.
B00005AFVR|3.0|I saw Springsteen twice during the 1999/2000 tour, including once at the Garden where this was recorded.  I didn't feel he did as good of song selection this time as he did back in the eighties.  Too much of it sounded alike to me.  Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff here.  I particularly like &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot;.  But some of the stuff just sounds all alike.<br />Just a quick comment about the live show itself - I couldn't believe how lousy his sound system was.  And the Boss is so well known for his perfectionism and I was disappointed in how poor the sound was.  His eighties shows were much better.
B000005H7D|5.0|This is it!! Coltrane's powerfull soloing capabilities at the best I love the title track. It has a wonderful mysterious sound that is underlined with the stunning solos of Lee Morgan (trumpet) and Curtis Fuller (trombone). Get this cd!!!
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 has released a plethora of quality work over the years, including &quot;War,&quot; &quot;Rattle and Hum,&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby.&quot; But &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is their career milestone. The album begins with a long keyboard intro and then kicks into overdrive with &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name,&quot; a pulsing ode to Bono's visit to Ethiopia in 1986 and my favorite song ever written. The next 8 tracks that follow all hit the spot. &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; and &quot;With or Without You&quot; were both #1 singles. The thumping drum beat intro of &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; sticks to your brain like a fly on fly paper. Bono's tone has never sounded richer, fuller, or more beautiful as on &quot;Red Hill Mining Town,&quot; &quot;Running to Stand Still,&quot; and &quot;In God's Country.&quot; &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; was the Top 10 single never released. Only the last two tracks, &quot;Exit&quot; and &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared,&quot; fail to register as classic U2 numbers, although both have a formidable melody.
B00000I41J|5.0|This is the album if you don't have you need to get. With Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderley together they created magic. Miles's soulfull playing ablities and Adderley's tone and creative genius they created the perfect blend bottled in this recording. This is one you'll be groving with for a long time.
0060920084|5.0|I kept my husband awake by laughing constantly while I read this book at bedtime.
006016848X|3.0|I think Gray over-simplifies things quite a bit.  Yes, men and women are different in many ways, but we're also different in so many more ways as individuals, regardless of gender.  Too many blanket generlaizations that I think just miss the mark.   Actually, I read a better book ont he subject by Dr. Betsey Bittlingmaier, &quot;Shape Your Personality -- Shape Up Your Marriage.&quot;    A lesser known book, but actually much more on the mark.
B00004STPT|5.0|Oh, I really love this soundtrack. From the ones I know it stands out as a creation that succeeded in seizing the essence of the outstanding motion picture &quot;Gladiator&quot;.<br />The thing that makes a soundtrack great is the inability to separate it out of the film; Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard have done it. Whenever I listen to it I remember Maximus, Proximus and all the rest of the crew that have made the movie so good.<br />If you loved the movie, and chances you did are high, getting this souvenir would be a natural act. I truly recommend this disc. Myself, I can listen to it time and time again, and it never gets boring. The music is great as a background for a nice evening or a romantic night - it does have a kind of magic ...<br />So, to conclude, as some say,&quot; if you buy only one soundtrack this year&quot; - let it be Zimmer's and gerrard's Gladiator.
B00003CXE7|5.0|All the &quot;My God, he's gorgeous!&quot; aside, this film is wonderful.  The title character is one you root for from the beginning and the supporting characters you either love to love or love to hate.  Beautifully filmed and expertly directed, there are no slow spots in this one!
B00004ZB9D|4.0|This is 1 great cd!! Lenny or I should say Mr. Kravitz has some major talent.Every single morning before I go to school I had to play this cd(up really really loud) it helps wake me up and you can help it but you find yourself dancing around and singing very loud to this cd.I give it 4.5 insted of 5 stars just b/c sometimes it gets a little old ,but I still love it!!Lenny Kravitz rocks I can't wait until he comes out w/ a new cd!! Go buy this right now (I mean it!!)
B00000IOSU|4.0|OMG, I am so tired of people complaining about artists who finally achieve commercial success and calling them sell-outs. .... I mean, sure, you can be unhappy with the song selection, but don't deny that this is a great document of Sarah at her peak. Listen to the crowd response! Her fans adore her and she so plainly loves them back. Perhaps this was a missed opportunity for McLachlan to introduce her back catalog, but her popularity alone has helped do that. If you liked Sarah's last two studio sets (\\"Surfacing\\" and \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstacy\\"), then you'll love this. If you want the early stuff live, then this isn't the place to find it.
0380973650|5.0|It's a rare author who weaves a perfect, creative narrative from the best of all possible materials, and a rare book that entertains, challenges, and entices from cover to cover with such a narrative.  Neil Gaiman's &quot;American Gods,&quot; the latest literary offering from the High Priest of the English Language's Temple of Original Stories, achieves exactly this for exactly that kind of writer.  In &quot;American Gods,&quot; the author of &quot;Neverwhere&quot; and the creator of the Sandman graphic novels fashions a story that fans will find distantly familiar, and new readers will lose themselves inside within a few pages.<br />The book opens with Shadow, the main character and an almost Shakespearian anti-hero, walking out of prison to learn that his wife has died.  On the plane ride home, he meets an enigmatic con-man named Wednesday who offers Shadow a job - and a second chance at life.  With little else to do except practice coin tricks he learned in prison, Shadow reluctantly accepts and the two begin a wintery, midwestern odyssey gathering other characters together in an attempt to weather an upcoming storm.  The book follow's Shadow's travels as he discovers who he's working for, what's going on, and more about himself than he would ever want to know.<br />The journey involves dreams, altered realities, other dimensions, strange encounters, and myths and folklore from every non-American culture on the planet.  As with other Gaiman work, there is a certain amount of fun to figuring out which fantastic character Shadow is talking to - and to figuring out where the twisting plot leads next.<br />Gaiman's premise - that gods are physically created by belief and made manifest - should be familiar to fans of his graphic novels, short stories, and other work.  It is this kind of creativity that sets Gaiman apart from other authors today; his stories are as timeless as the mythologies that span cultures across the world, and yet they are original and fresh enough to engage the reader on a primal and intellectual level.  After reading books like &quot;American Gods&quot; and Gaiman's other works, one imagines he would be utterly comfortable as a bard or storyteller, weaving tales of heros around the fireplace late at night to ward off the darkness and cold outside.<br />&quot;American Gods&quot; is just as epic as these old stories, and as engaging as a new novel should be.  Gaiman is one of the most important and welcome voices in English-language literature today, although intellectual praise shouldn't put off the reader searching for a good story, because that's exactly what one will find between these covers.  &quot;American Gods&quot; is a journey of delights that I can do nothing but recommend to any reader.gh to engage the reader on a primal and intellectual level.

B000059QY2|5.0|usually i prefer opera dvd's filmed in an opera house . if directed properly they can capture the basic theatricality of the event . eno's 'xerxes' and covent garden's 'carmen' readily come to mind .  needless to say not all dvd's capture the feel of actually being there . this is the first site-specific production that fully succeeds . the cinematography is ravishing . the costumes and make-up are inventive and beautifully rendered . the locations were wisely chosen and illuminate the plot .  equally important the singing seems 'live' and finely sung . pavorotti actually looks handsome and displays rare acting ability . i keep on going back to it , which is rare for me . i think this dvd would be a good intro  for friends who might think  opera is over their heads , or others who labor under the notion that opera is dull
0375703764|5.0|I know this book has had a lot of press (it is regularly discussed on the morning show of our local FM radio station), but I would say that House of Leaves is NOT for the casual reader.  For the reader who likes a challenge, however, once you figure out the basic premise of the story-within-a-film-within-a-story, things go along pretty smoothly, if weirdly. The horror story part is not shocking Stephen King like horror, it is more a sense of pervasive eeriness.  I thought the ever-expanding hallway, and more specifically the spiral staircase, were very cool.  (At one point, the spiral staircase expands upward away from the protagonist at a very rapid rate; his brother drops a coin which lands several hours later beside him; it is calculated that the coin fell 27,000 miles--twice the diameter of the earth--you just have to read the book).  The footnotes, and Zampano's narrative, are filled with dissertations on geometry, the source of Greek legends, etc etc., but I'm happy to say that I managed to read every one of them.  Despite the different format (footnotes within footnotes within footnotes, upside down and sideways and diagonal pages, etc.), I breezed through House of Leaves fairly quickly. A fun book if nothing else!
B00003CXCS|5.0|The Sound of Music is a perennial classic if not a masterpiece in cinematography! Those who rated it &quot;poor&quot; because of its dribbling sentiment and overbearing cuteness forget that they live in an age of growing cynicism. They only believe they have outgrown this film because they can no longer relate to its beauty.<br />The DVD is superb!
B000000W6F|4.0|This is a very good debut album from a great band. This album isn't their best though. It is mutch more basic than their next few albums. The insterments are still very good and the vocals rock.<br />The album starts out strong with the rockin track &quot;I Am One&quot; the olny song not written soly by Billy Corgan. James co-wrote this one. &quot;Siva&quot; is a bit more unique. I realy love this song. &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; is a slow phsicdelic song. &quot;Bury Me&quot; is one of the best songs on this album. The bass is just great. &quot;Crush&quot; and &quot;Suffer&quot; are good slow songs. &quot;Crush&quot; has strong bass and &quot;Suffer&quot; is another slow phycodelic song. &quot;Snail&quot; is my favorite song on this album. Its realy upbeat and sort of hippyish.&quot;Triessa&quot; isnt that great. I get lost on that track. Its just not specail but no skipping nessacary. &quot;Window Paine&quot; is realy cool but kind of creepy when he starts to sing accapella. He doesnt realy have an acapella voice(in NO way am I saying his voice is anything other than great!!!). Its cool though. I don't like &quot;Daydream&quot; because D'arys vioce sounds like an old crazy lady singing. Shes good on harmonys though. The music to that songs very pritty though. the hidden track is a good finisher. I think 5 stars is given out way to much, so im only giving it 4. If your goona get all of sps albums get this them in order so you can see how they changed (and it is dramatic). If your olny gonna get 1 get Mellone Collie. This album is better than most rock albums. Billys voice is great(allthough he shows it better on other albums).Also, Darcys bass is very good this album. Jimmy is a great drummer and maybe the most talented member of the band depending on how you rate talent. If you like phsycadelic music you'll probably like this album but most rock fans will like it too.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Hmmmm...anti_nazi needs his head examined and a German-to-English dictionary.<br />Being a long time fan of Rammstein, I bought Mutter the day it came out.  I don't think the album lived up to all the promotion and anticipation, but it's still on par with Sehnsucht and Herzeleid.  All in all, there's a lot of new ideas and experimentation which make for a good album if you have exhausted the previous albums and want something fresh.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple is one of the best song writers to come around in years. The lyrics are powerful and oh so poetic. Every track is a masterpiece. She plays piano wonderfuly and has great insturmenatlist on the album. Her vioce is one of the best out there. Her vioce has so mutch felling and power in it. It realy moves me. The album starts with &quot;Sleep To Dream&quot; a great song musicaly but probably the worst song lyricly on the album. The next song &quot;Sullen Girl&quot; is a song about how she was raped when she was twelve. Its a very sad but beuitiful song more on the jazzy side. The next song &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; is more on the the soulish/blues side. Another great song. Criminal is the most rock orientated song on the album. I love her vocals at the end of the song. &quot;Slow Like Honey&quot; is a great lyrical song with great music as well. &quot;The First Taste&quot; is one of the best songs on the album. The song just brings poetic thoughts into my mind everytime I hear it. Good instraments too. Than comes one of my favorite songs &quot;Never is a Promise&quot;. The strings are great, the pianos great and the vocals go right along with the song. You just have to hear the song! &quot;The Child is Gone&quot; is the worst song on the album but you still should listen to it good. &quot;Pale September&quot; has very devious pianos and is a very relaxing song. &quot;Carrion&quot; finishes the album off the right way with what eles a great lyirical, musical and vocal song!!! This is one of my favorite albums. I put it right up there with the classics and at least for me, will stand the test of time. Her lyrics inspire me so mutch, and hearing her music is one of the best ways for me to forget my problems. Pick this up I just don't see how you won't be inspired and love this album. I expect Fiona to be remebered as one of the best songwriters of our generation.
B000002BPS|4.0|This Offspring album is a great one because it's the first CD they did where they tried new things with their music. They got a little more alternative and a little less punk, but they pull it off effortlessly. I don't adore every song, hence only four stars, but 95% of the songs are outstanding.  Excellent beats and as always a different message in each one. You can really tell how they try to get some humor into some of their songs (Don't Pick It Up) as well as portray their opinions about things in life (I Choose). I have always been impressed with their musical and lyrical abilities. Just go for it and get the CD and see for yourself how awesome it is!
6305657939|5.0|The best movie I ever saw!!  Pierce Brosnan plays the role of the multi-billionaire-thief perfectly, along with his co-star Rene Russo.  This movie is deffinatly my all-time favorite.  The conclusion of the movie was the greatest I've ever seen.  A funny, smart, and brilliant ending.  It's a must see movie!  A great movie for everyone, if they cut the nude scenes out.  Anyone would enjoy this movie.  Go buy your copy today!
B00000DHRZ|3.0|This album is great to own for any Offspring collection. It has some fabulous songs that are catchy and of course send a message, as always. The only reason I give it three stars is because in MY OPINION it isn't their best album. It's a completely different sound (and on some songs, not for the better). For those of you who like Pretty Fly for a White Guy, then you'll love this album. I was not impressed with that song, hence this isn't a favorite. However, this CD is still worthy of playing and owning, especially if you want to have a complete Offspring collection. If you're new to listening to The Offspring, I'd try a different album on for size to start with, maybe Ixnay on the Hombre or Conspiracy of One. Otherwise, it's every man for himself on this one!

B00004XQ83|5.0|This album &quot;blows me away&quot; each time I listen to it.  I loved the movie because the music played such an integral part of the film.  Heck, the tunes were another set of actors!  That is how important they were.  I could not wait to get the CD and sent another to my father, born in Kentucky and raised on &quot;old time&quot; music.  &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; in all 3 versions brings me great joy.  &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot; - gets me swaying.  As a kid I sang in a girl-trio in church and so &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; brings back memories.  You must purchase this album.
0312263120|5.0|This is a great book for those who like techno-thrillers.  It is also provides the reader with a lot of interesting facts and background, as far as the NSA is concerned.  I also really liked all the information about codes and code breaking.  The book is well written and is a real page turner.  Every time I put the book down, I found myself wondering when I would be able to return to it, to see what happend next.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I have played this CD 3 times since I opened it this morning.   It feels like an old favorite already and India.Arie feels like an old friend.  There are no tracks that make me want to skip immediately to the next one.   Smooth and easy.
B00003CXQY|5.0|When I first heard about the plot of the revamped &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; I thought it was going to be the worst animated Disney feature in history. Most songs from Sting were not going to be used at all. However, The Emperor's New Groove turned out to be a fantastic movie, in my opinion at least. It had some bad reviews and a lot of criticism from Disney-fans. But, I'm a long-time Disneyfan myself and I must say that, although it's definitely not what you expect from Disney, this movie is NOT to be missed! If you haven't seen it yet, order it now. The 'Ultimate 2 Disc Edition' contains a lot of extras which make it well worth the little extra money above the standard edition. You will watch this movie over and over again. Guaranteed! &quot;Long live Kuzco!&quot;
B000002MIY|4.0|If you love that smooth Steely Dan style, you can't go wrong here. Fagen sings and his old buddy Walter Becker produces, plays bass and lead guitar. It is a beautiful and joyous sound. Rhythmic, pulsating, swinging. A real musical treasure and one that won't fade away in a couple of years. This one stays with you. Do your self the favour.
B000002H70|5.0|This was the first Cure CD I obtained, and it is the one that got me into them...I had downloaded them before and I didnt pay much attention. But Robert Smith has beautifully painstaking lyrics and gorgeous music...its beautiful. A definite buy for any Cure or gothic music fan.
B00004XOWM|1.0|If hobos were culled in a desultory fashion, told to singer a capella after smoking 100 cigars, their vocal talents would far supercede those of durst.  He is bar none the least talented singer in any year, of any decade, of any century.
0060392886|2.0|If you have followed Motley Crue throughout their career, even part way, then you know what's in this book.  There are some tidbits of stuff in there that have not been made to the general public before, and are the only interesting items to read.  But over all, this book is beyond boring.  Tommy and Nikki slept with every Playboy Playmate in existence. So?  Then they married them all, divorced them all, and whined about them all.  Sorry, but you get no sympathy if you go through Playmates the way normal people go through paper towels.  They had the good life and screwed it up.  Royally.<br />Synopsis of the book - woke up, did bags of dope, slept with numerous women, passed out.  Turn page and repeat.<br />The true shining light of this book what the chapter on Vince and Skylar.   That was truly heartbreaking.  No one should have to go through that much pain.<br />Save your money - go see them in concert.
B00004Z459|2.0|Its astonishing to witness how many overtly anti-boyband teens can be vacuumed into the genre by sneaky music producers.  Of course these boy bands are given coarse voices, bleached hair, and angry lyrics, but the idea is the same.  Linkin Park is the packaged product of producers who are trying to be like Limp Bizkit(A heinous crime in itself, superseded only the crime of allowing such an untalented and asinine singer as Durst to make it big).  Not convinced, \\"take in the end\\" and get it to the part where they have the \\"put my trust\\" solo.  Then have a girl listen to just that cut and listen to her response.  I bet she says, \\"is this the new one from the backstreetboys?\\"
0671024256|5.0|To say Stephen King is candid about what it's like to be writer is an understatement. He visits with the reader, and not from a pedestal. I felt at home. It is a refreshing read &quot;on writing&quot;. Stephen King does not fill the pages with prim and proper, cute, tidy, clever, but empty phrases-like other works I've read. This book has provided a lot of insight for me and will continue to do so. If you're a beginning writer, you got to read this. Mr. King, thanks for caring and sharing.
044022425X|4.0|The fourth in the Outlander series, Drums of Autumn begins in Charleston in 1767 where Claire, Jamie, Fergus and Ian begin a journey to find Jamie's Aunt Jocasta who owns a plantation in North Carolina.  As with the previous three novels in this series, Diana Gabaldon weaves stories within stories creating a rich tale of adventure, suspense and love.  <br />In Drums of Autumn Brianna, Jamie and Claire's daughter travels back in time to find her parents to warn them of disaster in their future.  Brianna found a story in an old newspaper telling of the death of Jamie and Claire Fraser in a house fire.  Roger Wakefield, Brianna's sometime boyfriend, also found the story.  Roger decided not to tell Brianna for fear she would attempt to go back in time to warn her parents.  When Roger learns that Brianna has done exactly that, he follows her through the stones back to 18th century Scotland.    Brianna finds her way to Lollybrach and meets Jenny, Jamie's sister, and Ian and all the children.  This is a wonderful part of the book where the reader can appreciate and feel the amazing connection between past and future, gave me the chills just reading it.<br />Roger eventually catches up with Brianna in the colonies after Roger's most arduous ocean crossing.  I do agree with several of the other reviewers who feel that Brianna's character is a bit weak.  I haven't caught on to, or much liked, Brianna at all since the first introduction of her character.   Brianna does not have the depth or heart that Claire has and comes off as a self-centered child in many ways.  <br />Brianna and Roger each have their own separate adventures and each is intertwined with Jamie and Claire's.  Lord John Grey appears again to play an integral role in Brianna's life.  The character of Lord Grey is one of my favorites as he is a man of honor.  <br />In Drums of Autumn Jamie is not the ferocious warrior, nor the persecuted prisoner; he's a farmer and a builder.  Although it was a relief of sorts not to endure any floggings or near-death misadventures, it seemed as though Jamie was out of his element having been removed from Scotland.  Nonetheless, this book was everything the previous books were in it's own way.  Diana Gabaldon has succeeded in continuing the `love that spans time' between Jamie and Claire and has added more depth to their relationship.  <br />This series is one of the best I have read.  I was overjoyed to discover the 5th in the series, The Fiery Cross, has already been released already so I won't have to wait to continue this engrossing saga.

1573226521|3.0|Throughout reading The Beach I felt a sense of deja vu. Perhaps Lord of the Flies; Perhaps Heart of Darkness ( The Horror! the Horror!) I think we have a copycat on our hands! Despite a unique situation and setting, this modern day paradise seemed also unoriginal and bland. The ending was unreal and although I gave this novel a 3. The 3 came from my like of the characters.
0553264427|4.0|'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' is my first John Le Carre novel, and one of only a few Soviet-USA spy novels I've read.  I decided to give it a try because I remember as a boy (in the 1960s) that this was THE spy novel to end all spy novels.  My thoughts?  I was both overwhelmed and underwhelmed.<br />Firstly, the story is about a burned-out British spy coming home after a rough (and somewhat failed) assignment from Berlin (..right after the days of when the wall was built).  At least a third of the book is devoted to his subsequent breakdown; the reader now understands that the life of a spy is somewhat less glamourous than that of Mr. 007.  Whilst weak and vulnerable, he is approached by East German intelligence officials to see if money can persuade him to divulge information. And then ... the story takes off, with many bumps and twists.<br />I was very impressed with the overall 'cold', depressing feel of this novel.  The first half of the novel is very believable, especially our burned out 'hero/spy'.  But then Le Carre gets too clever for his own good and spins a story with too many plot twists; it is blown completely out of the realm of realty, and it makes for a confusing read.  Other reviewers have called this novel one of Le Carre's easiest to understand.  On that note I will not give him a second chance.<br />Bottom line: a moody, brooding cold war novel with an authentic feel.  Just don't let Le Carre's over-enthusiastic imagination deter you from enjoying the book.
B000002BFZ|5.0|as a more recent pearl jam fan, i got yield first and i'm still listening to that, and i proceeded to buy binaural next, which was fine but not amazing in the least, and then i bought this one and i like it the best i think. this one really never slumps in it's flow, and the songs performed live might even be better. from sometimes to around the bend, no code pulls it's weight the whole way. it's just easy listening, real smooth, and just fun to rock out to or mellow out to at different times, or if you're in just the mood for every style of music pearl jam ever experimented with, no code would be first choice. so eclectic and great that it just cant be overlooked. i love pearl jam, not to mention the casing and inserts in the album. pretty sweet. anyway, if you're a new fan, steer clear of no code. i'd go with ten, vs, or yield.
0743420373|5.0|I bought this book expecting to get the REAL lifestyles of the rich and famous, and I did. I expected to get an understanding of their attitudes towards making, spending and saving money, and I did. What I didn't expect was to be utterly fascinated!<br />This book elucidates every aspect of personal economics and backs it all up with statistical tables compiled from intensive research. Sounds super dry, doesn't it? Well, I was happily surprised to find that I could NOT put this book down! The authors' presentation of the information, coupled with the real-life stories throughout, is entertaining and enjoyable. By far the best book I've read in a long time.
B000000WA4|5.0|The pumpkins are not my favorite band. as a matter of fact, there's a lot of things i'm listening to right now that i would rather listen to than the pumpkins. now, i'm not saying that i dont love them because i've been listening to them for years and years now and i still love their stuff. i recently picked up siamese dream again and still think it's amazing, but it simply doesnt get any better than this. i can listen to mellon collie all the way through so many times in a row that it's just rediculous. i simply love this album. even though there's some total trash on it, (we only come out at night), i love this album. it's a work of art really. the whole masterpiece was put together in 2 years, which makes it even more unbelievable. i didnt think in 1993 they could ever top siamese dream but they passed that test with flying colors. however, they never topped mellon collie. too bad. thanks for the memories guys.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This is one of a very few movies where physical transformation of the main actor is very visible during the course of the movie. For the first half-an-hour or so, the beer-belly Tom Hanks is difficult to go unnoticed. Yet, after he has supposedly spent few years on a deserted island, Hanks emerges thin, tanned and \\"fat-free\\", just like your best archetype of a survivor. One must admire the lengths to which Tom Hanks have gone in order to prepare for this role. Otherwise, the film itself is what you would expect it to be: a modern Robinson Crusoe story with the necessary effects, casting and quality of a good movie. Yes, it could have been better, but it's still worth seeing. If you are fond of Tom Hanks, you will want to have this one in your DVD library!
B00005J9M1|5.0|This new release of Very (for my money the best of the Pet Shop Boys albums) is expensive. There's also very little that hasn't already been released on CD. That said, it's still well worth buying.<br />The first CD is Very itself, which you should all know and love, right down to the hidden track at the end. (Titled Postscript in the linear notes.)<br />The second CD contains sixteen tracks and lasts over 77 minutes, but only three of the tracks are previously unreleased, and all three songs have been released in different versions. There's a version of Go West, that while not radically different from the more familiar mix, offers enough to be worth listening to. Forever in Love is a version of a track from Restless, that's most notable for the addition of some extra vocals. Falling will be new to anyone who hasn't heard the Kylie version, as far as I'm aware. It's average Pet Shop Boys (which means it's great, obviously). The other tracks on the second CD are previously released mixes and b-sides, as you can see from the track listing above. Highlights include Shameless, Decadence and Some Speculation.<br />The 36 booklet surprised me by being full of information. After a short introduction you get lyrics and comments from Neil and Chris for each track. Informative, and frequently very funny, it really adds to the value of the package.<br />Overall, then, you're not getting an awful lot of new music. It doesn't matter. Very is a classic album, it's nice to have the music on the second CD included in one place (and especially nice for people who didn't buy all the singles) and the sleeve notes are superb. A great package all round.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This film will make a nice addition to your DVD library and it is very likely that you will (want to) watch it more than once.

0812550757|5.0|I've read the first three books in this series, Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide. I thought Ender's Game was a surprisingly good book with an amazing twist at the end. Speaker demonstrates Card's ability to really delve into the depths not only of interesting characters but societal interactions as well. This is the kind of book that SciFi is all about - not shooting up aliens in fancy spaceships - but a sociological study of human interaction with unknown intelligence.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This definitely is one of the best films ever made and it should be part of everyone's DVD library. Gandhi was a very special person and his life story, personal philosophy and approach to life are a fountain of wisdom. You can watch this film over and over and each time you learn something new. From technical perspective, the film is well made and the fact that it lasts for almost 3 hours is actually to its advantage. Ben Kingsley's performance is also top-notch. There is no question in my mind whether to recommend this movie or not: GO! Buy it, now!
B00004ZD69|5.0|Put simply, Godspeed You Black Emperor is a rock orchestra. Hailing from Canada, this nontet features a cellist, a few violinists, a couple guitarists, two drummers, and a tape deck. It's almost impossible to specify how many of each instrument there are since the band only uses first names and they don't mention who plays what on the album. There was the addition of two trumpetters for this album though.<br />On Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven, Godspeed gets full use out of their orchestra, letting the ideas run wild. If you know anything about the band, you know for sure that they specialize in doomsday music, ominous, terrifying landscapes of the end time. Just listen to the first two minutes of f#9#infinity for proof. For the first disc here, they more or less stick with that idea. The music of Godspeed is cyclic. It mostly rises in falls in cycles that last 7 or 8 minutes. The first crescendo is reached in the first six minutes of &quot;Storm,&quot; in a section called &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven...&quot; It starts simply enough with an easily strummed guitar and a few muted trumpets, the volume slowly rising. Then the addition of a xylophone adds it's opinion. So far it just sounds like people sitting around a campfire doing a slow jam. With the addition of a cello and a violin it finally starts to sound like it's going somewhere. They play nothing complicated, just the same melodies over and over, maybe it will get somewhere, maybe not. Then a strong drumbeat snaps all the intruments into order. The song becomes a march, with all the instruments adding their part, nothing coming to the forfront, just everything adding to the collective march. It's amazing, gripping, and probably the best thing I've heard all of 2000. It makes me proud to be human.<br />The collective of Godspeed are true craftsmen. They treat their tapes like marble that they carve into magnificent sculptures of sound, each instrument working on a different part. Godspeed You Black Emperor, with all of their political motives, doomsday themes, f-all attitude, and long drawn-out symphonies, may be the most pretenious band in rock today. But maybe they have to be. To make such gripping, engaging music, maybe they have to have egos as big as the music sounds.
B00003CXPD|5.0|You should see this movie. Period. The story of a boy who fell in love with ballet and, through his dream, he elevated not only his own career, but also his own family relations, is simply irresistible. The surroundings of a mid-sized English town during the difficult times of economic depression only add to the special character of this movie. This is a great family movie -- a wonderful mixture of hilariously funny, highly emotional and brutally real scenes. A great addition to your DVD library!
B000007O9L|4.0|During the Rolling Stones last tour, Philadelphia Inquirer rock critic Tom Moon urged the band to perform the &quot;back country&quot; of its career: the 30 years' hit singles carrying their legendary live shows (which became perfunctory in concert) then set aside for the blues, folk and hard country album tracks fortifying their greatest period. It would be a tour for hard-core Stones, hard-core rock fans.<br />Moon acknowledged the Stones always left concert room for some of these songs but never spent an album recreating them until 1994's exquisite &quot;Stripped.&quot;  This set, originally part of MTV's &quot;Unplugged&quot; series and titled &quot;Butt Naked,&quot; builds around the acoustic/electric guitar fight throughout its anthemic start-me-up &quot;Street Fighting Man.&quot; It's one of rock's least publicized musical stories; parallel to Southern blacks' migration to Chicago and other northern cities, expressed musically by everyone from Bob Dylan and Rod Stewart (and current Stone Ron Wood) to John Mellencamp and a generation's alt-country roots rockers.<br />Bob Clearmountain's clean-sounding engineering on &quot;Stripped,&quot; taken from intimate Amsterdam, Paris, Tokyo, and Lisbon venues, draw from Stone strengths. Mick Jagger's vocals remain weary in &quot;Angie,&quot; (featuring Chuck Leavell's tasteful piano)  &quot;Wild Horses,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Virginia,&quot; venomous in &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; (featuring excellent Wood slide guitar) and &quot;Let It Bleed,&quot; and sneering throughout a rousing &quot;Like A Rolling Stone.&quot; This cover returns Stax-Volt R&amp;B to that overdone anthem through Leavell's Booker-T style organ and a bluesy harp solo. (A video version of &quot;Stone,&quot; with &quot;Shattered&quot; and &quot;Tumbling Dice,&quot; is featured on &quot;Stripped&quot;'s enhanced CD.)<br />Keith Richards contributes trademark riffs throughout and vocally brings Memphis soul to the fore in &quot;Slipping Away.&quot; Despite their original hits becoming pro forma tour after tour, the Stones' respect for and command of their influences remains high; the Bo Diddley beat is poured over Buddy Holly's &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; ( Jagger replicaties Holly's vocal yips) while the classic blues &quot;Love In Vain&quot; and Willie Dixon's shuffle &quot;Little Baby&quot; get the deserved respect. All songs feature Charlie Watts' trademark commanding drumming; it is gratifying seeing him now recognized as the Stones' strongest asset.<br />While seeing a Stones concert is essential to any rock and roll experience, the many Rolling Stones live albums have sold that experience short. 1970's infamous &quot;Get Your Ya-Yas Out&quot; came closest to the blues and bile of being there; consider this highly recommended Stones souveneir an older, cleaner, no less meaner model.heir original hits becoming pro forma tour after tour, the Stones' respect for and command of their influences remains high; the Bo Diddley beat is poured over Buddy Holly's &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; ( Jagger replicaties Holly's vocal yips) while the classic blues &quot;Love In Vain&quot; and Willie Dixon's shuffle &quot;Little Baby&quot; get the deserved respect.

B00003CXA2|5.0|This is certainly one of the best films ever. Emotional, humorous and with sufficient action elements, this film owns most to the superb (!) performance of the main actor (Tom Hanks) and the director (Robert Zemeckis). The simple fact that this movie is the Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor should be enough to convince you that this title is a must-have. Go, buy one now!
0425156842|4.0|The bad news: It's not as good as the hype might lead you to expect. The good news: It's better than most of the other over-hyped pop-philosophy blockbusters on the shelves.<br><br>'Sophie's World' is at its worst when it pretends to be the sort of novel you would read purely for entertainment. That's because it starts out as a very good novel but finishes as a very bad one. Early on it catches your interest with an intriguing mystery and efficient classical narrative. Then about half way through, the author reveals his hand and ruins the plot. We are left with just another bit of post-modern ironic detachment or some such gimmick. From then on the fate of the characters ceases to matter, and as a novel it's all downhill from there on.<br><br>The book is at its best when it sticks to what Gaarder does best: lecturing on philosophy. This is where the fictive elements work best - by providing a character to voice the questions in our own heads. The author shows a good gra!sp of what will make sense to an uninformed reader, and provides a gentle ramble through a couple of dozen centuries of human thought that will help most people's understanding of the world in which we live.<br><br>That is not to say that Gaarder dispatches all periods in history with equal aplomb. His dealing with the metaphysical and ontological abstractions (jargon-free equivalent = world of ideas) of ancient Greece and the middle ages is exemplary. He manages to explain the more-or-less-unexplainable in terms of the easily-understood, in a way that more school texts should copy. Even the prickly thickets of 20th century existentialism yield up some of their unappetizing secrets under his patient hand.<br><br>Gaarder is least successful in dealing with creeds that go beyond pure ideas and involve a challenge to behaviour and lifestyle. His treatment of Marxism (which is not so much about ideas as it is about action) is shallow. His survey of Christianity (which is not about! ideas at all, but entirely about relationships) is derisory.<br><br>Amazon's warehouses contain better novels (for a first-class Scandinavian novel of ideas, try \\"Miss Smilla's Feeling For Snow\\") and better introductions to philosophy (e.g. Alain de Botton's 'Consolations of Philosophy'). In the end, however, 'Sophie's World' is surprisingly successful as a hybrid - it makes learning fun and deserves to be read.
B00003CXD0|5.0|This cute movie is already a classic. Watch Dustin Hoffman deliver his first great performance (these are 80's, remember?). Hoffman, playing an actor who cannot get a proper job, decides to take on a female role. He does this so wonderfully that he becomes a star female actor almost overnight. A series of humorous scenes as a result of this career change is a great treat for the viewer. The whole film is very funny, balanced and relaxing and should not be missing in your DVD library. Keep in mind, though that the film technical quality of the 80's cannot be compared with today's technology (and film budgets). All in all, however, you will not regret buying this one!
B000002UAR|5.0|What can I say, it is close to the perfect rock and roll record.  Only problems: it would be better if some of the songs were longer (AYBCS, Elenor Rigby), because they are so good it makes me so sad after 2:00 when they are over.  There are a few tracks that aren't that good (Yellow Submarine).  Here are the outstanding tracks: Here, There, and Everywhere; I'm Only Sleeping; She Said, She Said; For No One; Got To Get You Into My Life; and Tommorow Never Knows.  Listen to these songs a few times, and you will see why many critics call this album the best rock and roll album ever.   &quot;Turn off your mind, relax, and float down stream,    It is not dying, it is not dying&quot;
B00005BJMQ|4.0|For those who have seen the movie listening to the cd is most enjoyable. From fat boy slims dance track (if you can can) to the romantic medley sung by nicole kidman and ewen McGreggor listening to the cd lets you relive the colour and atmosphere of the movie. A personal favourite of mine on the cd is 'Roxanne' i loved it because of its overwhelming power!!!  The only reason i have for degrading the soundtrack one star is because some songs you have to be in the right mood to enjoy. But overall i loved the soundtrack as much as i did the movie......which is saying something!
0345350499|5.0|I have always loved the story of King Arthur, and now The Mists Of Avalon tells it from the woman's point of view. Marion Zimmer Bradley tells the story that keeps you reading all day long. This is a fairly large book, but it is so greatly written, that you can't put it down. <br />The book is full of characters that are unforgetable. The main struggle is between Morgaine, a follower of the lore of Avalon, and Queen Gwynhefar, a follower of Christianity. The story entangles love, jealously, and the fear of betrayal. As the Arthurian story comes to a conclusion, all I can think is that Bradley is a genius. I am glad that I became a part of The Mists.
B000002GMT|5.0|This one so far is my favorite ABBA CD. In my opinion, I Am The City is wonderful, in fact, it's my favorite ABBA song. I just love the beat to it and the lyrics are great. On and On and On is great, and so is When All Is Said And Done. The rest of the songs are good too, and I really like having so many songs on one CD. I recommend this CD to anyone.
B00003CXN4|2.0|I anxiously awaited seeing &quot;Traffic&quot; for this first time.  I must say that it was a dissapointment.  I keep waiting for the movie to pick up, but It never did.  No climax or conclusion in the film what-so-ever.  It drags along at the same pace, then bang, it's already over.  I don't see why Benico Del toro was praised so much by critics for this movie.  He must have only said 5 words of english in the whole thing.  This film will sadly make you feel no emotional at all for any of the characters, though probably does accurately tell the drug problem in AMerica
B00004SCX6|3.0|Since I have owned the cd, about a year now, I have experienced three stages of enjoyment of dislike. When I first put the cd into my stereo I looked over at my best friend like, &quot;OMG! This is like soooooo weird.&quot; Probably because we skipped strait to to the second track &quot;stronger,&quot; which later grew on me. After hearing for the third time I really started to like it, except for the last track- the one she co-wrote. After about the 35th time hearing &quot;Lucky&quot; and the 25th time hearing the entire album (my friend played &quot;Lucky over and over+ I saw the video all the time), I started to dislike it again. It's &quot;ok,&quot; now... Some of the tracks are good to dance to so I don't think my ... were a total waste. <br />However, if they made the cd over again without the last track I would prefer to have that one. The song is so juvenille and naive. &quot;Not that inocent&quot; does not apply to this song. This is the 13 year old- or younger- omg he is so cute I hope he thinks I'm cute too superficial dialogue. No offence to 13 year olds- I'm one myself- but I do admit some of us are that annoyingly superficial.<br /><br />Overall- three stars for the album.
B00003CXN4|1.0|Three things: 1. If Catherine Zeta-Jones never knew about her husband's business, how did she get so good at running it so fast? 2. Whenever the film went to Mexico, why was everything pinkish-orange?   3. How did Michael Douglas leave the White House press room so easily without passing anybody?<br />This film is terribly overrated.  I can't believe it got the notices it did.  The DVD is not unique in any way; typical stuff like behind the scenes and trailers.  I would have liked commentary.  (Even though I think if a film is made well enough, it doesn't have to be explained.)
B000007OY0|5.0|I generally don't like prison flicks but this one is a must see.  After having my arm twisted into watching it, I was surprised by this film.  It speaks of keeping hope and faith through adversity.  Need inspiration?  See this film.  It has a delightful cast.  It's a great story.  It has a fantastic plot with a surprise ending that you'll love. There are both poignant and light hearted moments.  Buy it.  You'll love it, too.

'The Last Precinct' picks up the day or so after with, not only a serious cleaning up job to be done, but yet again a mildly outrageous plot line crammed into about a one week over the Christmas period.  Without spoiling anyone's read, here are the high/low lights (nothing new here):<br />Highs:<br />:  if you're into the postmortem stuff, Cornwell's technical knowledge is excellent,<br />:  introduction of a strong, interesting and, seemingly normal new character, Jaime Berger, and<br />:  the pacing, in most parts, is 'rapid.'<br />Lows:<br />:  the aforementioned session with the shrink - will try anyone's resiliance,<br />:  the walk-through by Berger and Scarpetta at the Scarpetta crime scene - 'been there, read all about it' in the previous novel,<br />:  Kay's incredible paranoia and mistrust for everyone,<br />:  introduction of a scaly, reptilian lawyer,<br />Benton I:  continues to haunt us two years on (it's over, Kay.

Cornwell can definitely write well (when she wants to) and I'll continue to purchase her books (I may just wait a little longer so that I can enjoy the 69% saving currently offered on 'Black Notice') just so I can put in my two cents worth.
B00004STDN|1.0|Bad script, bad acting, bad technical climbing techniques, impossible scenarios, etc make this movie laughable. And would someone tell me if the helicopter rescue team member is really laughing when the woman falls to her death in the opening scene? Sure looks it to me. Terrible casting as well. A really really bad movie.

B0000028RR|5.0|This is a trly amazing C.D. It has everything good music sould have:cool riffs, good beats and intelagent lyrics. Zack De La Rocha's policticaly motavated lyrics show no mercy at exposeing the perjaduses and inequailties of capitalisium and socity in general.This is all set to Tom Morello's riffs and awesome distorted guitar souds.This albaum puts all mindless rap/metal bands ,ie. Limp Bizkit, to shame. A have for anyone who likes hard , smart, kick a$$ music.
630575067X|3.0|I measure it against my reaction to this flick which I saw both in the theatre as well as at home on video. From a technical standpoint, it suffers from an excess of special effects. It seems to me that having major characters such as Jar Jar exist only in digital form is a crutch; but a crutch for what, I cannot tell you. From the standpoint of the script, having young Skywalker destroy the federation's command ship by flying inside and blowing it up is a lazy rip-off of the first (chronologically speaking) Star Wars movie. And Liam Neeson? &lt;sigh&gt; Just going through the motions, IMHO.
B00005ASIL|5.0|Tull has been making records for over 30 years now.  In all that time, however, there has never been a single cd which fully represented their entire distinguished recording careeer.  The long wait is finally over with the release of this disc.  Featuring songs from their very early years, lilke &quot;Song for Jeffrey,&quot; &quot;Bouree&quot; and &quot;Living in the Past,&quot; up through their next to last studio album, &quot;Roots to Branches,&quot; this cd is an excellent sampler of the band's work.  Long-time fans of the band will, of course, already have copies of the songs on this disc, but the convenience of having them all together more than makes up for it.  My only quibble with the album is that it nowhere mentions Ray Davies and I believe that the inclusion of a more complete informative booklet on the history of the band or the songs on the album would have been a plus for those fans who already have these songs.  Still, this is definitely a must have cd for new fans and old.   Hopefully, in ten years time, we'll be able to look back on this cd and say, like the band did on their first album, &quot; This was how [Tull] were playing then-but things change...don't they!&quot;
0385121679|4.0|The Shining is one of the best books I've read of his in a long time. I would say any person who hasn't read The Shining has missed out on a very good novel.It remains has to become a true classic of Stephen King's and should be a mesmerizing book for readers.The ctory is about a caretaker named Jack Torrance and his family(his wife and son).His son has a matter of fact has a unique and rare power that only few people own.The family is snowbound in the hotel for seven mounths.Their communications have been blocked and it seems the caretaker is acting a little crazy.Now Jack Torrance is on a qeast to finsh a duty that may cost him his life.
B000001GK9|5.0|Love him or hate him, one must admit that Herbert von Karajan was one of the 20th century's greatest musicians.  Karajan made hundreds of recordings throughout his long, successful career.  Interestingly enough, however, he only began conducting Mahler in his later years, leaving behind only four recordings of Mahler symphonies(the 5th, 6th, and 9th twice, this being the second of the two).  Though his recorded Mahler legacy was miniscule, Karajan shows that he thoroughly understood Mahler, especially with this live recording of Mahler's 9th Symphony, which stands out as one of the greatest recordings of ANY orchestral piece.  Karajan conducts this symphony perfectly.  The articulation and accuracy are not as good as some of Karajan's studio recordings, but Karajan was a stickler for detail, thus his precision in this live recording is better than many studio recordings of other conductors.  Karajan takes the tempos and dynamics just right, and as a result is able to squeeze all the emotion intensity out of this symphony.  The sound quality is also superb in this recording, which was originally digital and was once again remastered, making it sound even clearer.  This recording is definitely one of the best recordings out there, in my opinion the best recording of a Mahler symphony, hands down.  One couldn't ask for a better combination of quality playing and great recording quality.  THIS IS A MUST HAVE!
B000002LJW|5.0|Released in 1988, this album contains the blend &amp; growth of Eric's past music.  In  &quot;Bad Love&quot; , Eric plays one of the best solo riffs ever!  You would be hard pressed to find another as a equal.  This should be in every Eric Clapton fan's collection.
B00000D9TK|5.0|This album proves that Céline Dion is one of the most talented musicians of our time. This album, though entirely in French, is a must have for anyone interested in Céline. It covers the artistic side of her voice. This album is by far her best to date. You don't have to know French to understand the pure emotions of these songs.          In &quot;Je Crois Toi&quot;(&quot;I Believe You&quot;), Céline portrays uncertinity and fear of the world. &quot;Zora Sourit&quot;(&quot;Zora Smiles&quot;)  is a great song that follows in Céline's styles from previous albums. &quot;On ne change pas&quot;(&quot;We Don't Change&quot;)is a very beautiful song. &quot;Je Chanterai&quot;(&quot;I'll sing&quot;) is an excellent track that is one of the best on the album.            &quot;Terre&quot;(&quot;Earth&quot;) shows a different side of Céline's musical range. &quot;En Attendant Ses Pas&quot;(&quot;Waiting For His Steps&quot;), is very fragile at start but picks up tempo to be one of the best tracks. &quot;Papillion&quot;(&quot;Butterfly&quot;) is a very slow song that shows off Céline's voice in all it's majesty. &quot;L'Abandon&quot; is one of my favourites on the album. With its calypso beat and irresistable rhythm it is a masterpiece.           &quot;Dans Une Autre Monde&quot;(&quot;In Another World&quot;) is a fun song that is really upbeat. &quot;Sur Le Meme Bateau&quot;(&quot;On The Same Boat&quot;) is a masterpiece. It is about the rich and the poor aboard a cruise. When a catasrophe takes place, they all have to face death, despite their social status (which could have been on the &quot;Titanic&quot; soundtrack). Céline gives her all in &quot;Tous Les Blues Sont Ecrits Pour Toi&quot;(&quot;All Of The Blues Are Written For You&quot;), a showstopping blues song. Closing with &quot;S'il Suffisait D'Aimer&quot;(&quot;If Only Love Could Be Enough&quot;) this song is by far the best track. In the is song, Céline expresses her dream for an end to violence and hate. The lyrics and the music are so moving. <br />    Many people criticize Céline's music for being too sappy and gushy-- this album proves that she is not and that she has an amazing gift.
6305922756|5.0|This movie is really funny. A lot of folks think that you must be into Heavy Metal... to enjoy this film. They are sadly mistaken this movie is great. I have had many folks who are into Opera and Country music see this movie and they love it. One of the funniest movies of all time! The DVD is loaded with extras and holds it&#8217;s own against the now famous Criterion version. The video and audio transfer were well done considering the age of this movie.
B000002KNY|5.0|I am a talking heads fan, and this is my favorite album. It strikes the balance between Just enough quirky garage sound, and just enough Brian Eno &quot;treatments&quot;.  At the end of the day it embodies what would seem to be an oxymoron: Intelligent pop music! (notice the Disco riff on &quot;Paper&quot;) It perfectly captures the high-treble new wave sound of the 80's without beeing screechy. This is the sound that IS early 80's new wave.  The only other album that comes close to this sound is Eurithmics &quot;love is a stranger&quot; and/or &quot;sweet dreams&quot;.<br />Another reviewer mentioned some similarities between this album and Radiohead... Is radiohead influenced by the Talking Heads? They named themselves AFTER A TALKING HEADS SONG! (&quot;Radiohead&quot;, on &quot;True Stories&quot;)<br />Anyway, this is a great album to listen to when it's too hot to bear and you take off your shirt and lie on the icy lynoleum and listen to &quot;cool&quot; songs.  Not for TH beginners, but sooo worth the money. And yes, it holds up like the great wall of china, still standing after all these years!  Pure Sonic Goodness.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|One of the scariest horror movies of all time. Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, which followed, were comedies in my opinion. Not that they were not good, actually they are both great in their own rights. But Evil Dead is true horror, I remember seeing this in theaters during a mid-night showing in the `80s and it scared the hell out of everyone. It is even better on DVD. The audio and video have been remastered, this film has never looked this good. The audio commentaries by Sam and Bruce are priceless as well as the excerpts and extras included. This is the only version of this film to own. Folks familiar with Elite will know what I am talking about. Those of you who have not seen an Elite DVD are in for a pleasant surprise.
B000002ADT|5.0|1st of all, yes this is a highly enjoyable album, instrospective genius, catchy as the flu &amp; a good intro the world of Miles or indeed jazz in general. However it bugs me that people resort to lazy journalism &amp; say oh yes everybody says it's the best jazz lp of all time therefore it must be. There are many different forms &amp; styles of this music we call jazz. This just happens to the highest plateau of relaxed, late @ night or cafe soundtrack but it isn't a journey to the outer dimensions, a stomping funk monster, nor does it blast yr ears off like the best free jazz. In the same year as Kind of Blue, his sideman John Coltrane released the equally catchy &amp; more upbeat Giant Steps &amp; even more importantly Ornette Coleman emerged from relative obscurity w/ the mighty unprecedented beauty &amp; brilliance of The Shape of Jazz To Come. So I say to the jazz newcomer, if that's who's reading this, by all means pick up KOB but get those 2 as well [&amp; a million others I could recommend]. Anyway from the set I like All Blues &amp; So What best, Flamenco Sketches [yes there's 2 takes of it even] doesn't do it for me as well as Sketches of Spain itself certainly does. So before you accuse me of gross blasphemy, I'm not knocking the masterpiece off its pedestal, just getting it to not hog the spotlight. My Miles favourites: On The Corner, Get Up With It, Sketches, Jack Johnson, Nefertiti, Miles In The Sky, etc.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Not being a Civil War buff I was a little apprehensive when I purchased this movie. I figured that it would be a documentary with actors. I had also heard that it was the longest movie ever made. When I got it I planned to watch it in two sittings due to the length of the movie. I was so engrossed in the film that I had to watch it all in one sitting. The movie was very well done and four plus hours seemed to pass like a couple of hours. I highly recommend this movie to all viewers. It will make you proud to be an American. The movie does not display the South as evil and North as good which is typical in most Hollywood Civil War movies. Instead it gives you a real insight to the folks who fought this war not justifying one side or the other but basically presenting it as an American tragedy, which it undeniably was.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I don't place movie reviews here on Amazon, I usually stick to the music side of this site. But this movie immediatly prompted me to write a review on it. So when I rented this movie not expecting much in return, just something to fill my evening while the wife and kids were out of town. I was truely moved by the movie. Steven Soderbergh has now made two fantastic films in a row, and is truely a craftsman of films when it comes to all the junk that fills the screens these days.<br />And what can I say about Benicio del Toro. I can't, his performance was brilliant to say the least. M.Doulglas, and C. Zeta-Jones acted just as well too. The un-sung hero in this movie is Ericka Christiansen, who plays Douglas' daughter. You could feel the pain that she was going through as an addict, and the turmoil that it put on her parents was very convincing.<br />This movie was hands down the best of 2000.
6302994063|5.0|Being a dancer myself, I'm automatically drawn to any film involving dance. And I must say that this is one of my favorite movies along side &quot;Singing In The Rain&quot;. It's humorous and intellegent, and the dance sequences are fabulous. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I would even go so far as to say it makes fun of ballroom dancing. An all around great film with a good enough skript that you don't even have to like dance to enjoy it. Although, you might enjoy dance a little more after you've seen it.
B000002I2I|5.0|After the pop disappointment &quot;soft parade&quot; and the Miami show the Doors were pretty much public enemies but still rocked.  This album shows it, they were back into hard rock and roll they were well known for.  The teenboppers were gone, the chicks were gone, Morrison was burning out, the band was getting better musically.  Rolling stone said that &quot;roadhouse blues&quot; started out the album good but it goes downhill, no it doesn't! This is also the magazine that hated Led Zeppelin and loves the corporate pop bands!  This is a good album, pure rock and roll and a great comeback getting the signature &quot;doors sound.&quot; The Doors would record one more album together with Jim after this.
0446677450|5.0|Why isn't this book introduced in Personal Finance classes in all upper level institutions?  This book changed my life.  My outlook on financial matters and life itself is different.  No longer will I remain in the rat race.  The book was very easy to read and kept my attention throughout.  I recommend this book to all who wants to understand money and who wants to initiate financial independence.
B000007S5B|4.0|These are the lines with one of the highlight songs &quot;Not to touch the earth.&quot;  This album turns Jim into more of the Shaman and away from the goodie too shoes sex symbol. Jim's voice is filled with a lot of screaming and anger with the songs on this album &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;'s video is extremely disturbing when seeing Jim get shot with blood gushing out of his mouth when the gun sounds in the song.  &quot;Five to one&quot; is the sort of protest, anti-war, youth is king song you have in your mind. &quot;Five to one baby, one and five, no one hear gets out alive...&quot;  The band were extremely tired and it shows, Paul Rothchild was obsessed about perfectiong so the songs were done over and over so it's obvious they were fed up with each other and in some songs the band just is tired as ever, overall, a good album but the years to come would get worse..
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I bought this soundtrack prior to viewing the movie.  I was inititally unimpressed, but at every listening, I am growing more and more enchanted with this CD.  David Bowie's version of Nature Boy (the first song on the soundtrack) is good, but John Leguziamo's version would have been a vast improvement.  My favorite song by far is &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot;.  The arrangement of this song is simply fantastic,although it would have been nice to hear Jose Feliciano sing more than a faint background vocal.  I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone and like other reviewers, I hope a second volume is released eventually.
B000002I2G|3.0|Wow, you might think, &quot;uh.. Touch me is a teenybopper top 20 radio hit but nothing else on the album sounds like that.. right?&quot; very wrong. The album is a pop album, and the doors with pop music doesn't work with strings and a horn section blasting out jazz.  This was considered to be a &quot;sell out&quot; record and did very horribly from fans and critics, this would also lead to horrible shows and the chaos at the Miami show getting jim arrested and banned in almost 20 states, not a good move Lizard King!
B00004U45G|5.0|This is undoubtless Jimmy Page`s best post- Zeppelin era album. Although Robert Plant insulted the Black Crowes some time ago, he should realice that they are actually a much better company for Jimmy than HE was in the No Quarter album. No weak tracks on this double Cd; Zeppelin covers and Rock and Roll classics (B.B. King, Fleetwood Mac) are equally spectacular. Chris Robinson squeezes the lemon almost like Plant did, Sven Pipien plays a superb bass solo on &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;, Rich Robinson and Audley Freed are an incredible guitar duet, and Steve Gorman (although not as good as Bonham, of course) is a unique drummer. What can I say about Jimmy? The only thing I know is that his time as guitar player hasn`t come yet. This album deserves 5 stars for it`s play, sound and production, and is much better than &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;. All of this plus an enhanced program featuring live footage.
B000002I2M|5.0|What a classic, you know? The Doors provided so much energy on this album, You have &quot;The changeling&quot; giving the nice groove sound followed by &quot;Love her madly.&quot; Then there's &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; with the famous &quot;Mr. Mojo Rising!&quot; over and over getting louder, it proved that after Jim died he would be legendary. The album closer &quot;Riders on the storm&quot; is one of the most amazing poetic works ever by Jim.  The lightning crackles in the speakers and the killer is on the streets finding who he can but ends with a fade out and it's the end of the album..  Jim would die later that year on July 3rd in Paris and the remaining doors would continue to record, &quot;Other voices&quot; and &quot;full circle,&quot; very unknown albums indeed, but Jim would be irreplaceable, on Storytellers i was mad that Scott staap sang &quot;light my fire&quot; and &quot;Roadhouse blues&quot; and got cheered on but that's just me, I don't like him, he's soooo cynical and deserves to be booed at for his personality and his willingness to diss PJ and Eddie Vedder and still copy them.. But anyway, haha back to the doors, I suggest this be in your album rack..
B000002H92|5.0|This double CD is actually a compliation of three previously released albums: \\"Absolutely Live\\", \\"Alive She Cried\\" and \\"Live at the Hollywwod Bowl\\". I`ve always complained about the sound quality and play of most live Doors recordings. But when Morrison really wanted, he could be the best Rock and Roll singer of all time, set the night on fire and performe until he couldn`t stand any more. The songs included here are the best ones ever featured ona live Doors set. Highlights include: \\"Soul Kitchen\\", \\"Light my Fire\\", \\"You make me Real\\" and \\"Moonlight Drive\\". Looking for a good live Doors Cd? Buy this one.
B000002I27|5.0|The Doors knew they couldn't match their first album so even though they knew they still tried.  So they came up with &quot;strange days&quot; the 2nd album from the doors and proved to be better much better sound in terms of the first, with more studio production, synthesizer, backwards piano, and the studio making changes to Jim's voice to get a stranger sound.  This is a great album, simply put it, it has a mind of its own, you have the mysterious &quot;People are strange&quot; nice romantic sound followed by Robby Kreiger's guitar on &quot;moonlight drive,&quot; blues with &quot;Love me two times,&quot; and of course the followup to &quot;The end;&quot; &quot;When the music's over.&quot; The screaming lines, &quot;we want the world and we want it now!!!&quot; is a warcry and would predict the Doors' popularity in the years to come, very classic rock.
0679735909|5.0|This is my favorite book.  I read it about once a year, and I always find something new to notice in it.  It is a literary detective story, a very sharp and accurate depiction of the struggles of competing views of literary criticism in the 1980s, and also a deep and complex love story that addresses, on a very personal level, the great philosophical struggles of late Victorianism.  Darwinism and its impact on the central question of whatwe all are as humans, and connected religious questions are all addressed in the context of an extremely moving story about complex, adult characters who certainly did not expect or necessarily expect to find a soul mate in each other who would radically change each of their lives.  <br />This is not an easy book to read--it requires careful reading and a willingness to give Victorian poetry and conventions a chance.  If you are patient with it it will return your efforts one thousand-fold.
B00003CXS4|5.0|LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS showed the new talent in the noir/comedy genre that is Guy Ritchie.  SNATCH proves that he is terrific at what he does.<br />SNATCH is a giddy, rollicking gangster comedy that is one of the funniest things I have ever seen hit the screen.  LOCK STOCK was very good, but Ritchie proves that he has an original visual style that works well with his films' typical fast paced styling and editing.  Ritchie's camera moves all over the place in odd spins and twists, jumpcuts, sudden speed changes, and pauses.  It's brilliant camerawork that adds to the impact of the more serious moments of the movie.<br />Even though it is the supporting cast that truly keeps this film chugging, every single actor is great in their part.  Benecio is quite funny in his small roll, as is Brad Pitt, who steals every single scene he is in.  But the fast paced, rapid-spit style dialog that is given by each actor is so funny that there seems to be no way anyone can screw it up.  This is a guy film all the way, even considering that the only female actress who isn't nude is Pitt's &quot;mother,&quot; who registers well in her roll.  The actors have terrific chemistry with everyone, and that makes every performance even more believable.<br />The story really can't be explained, since it's all over the spectrum, but it involves underground boxing, a HUGE diamond, a funny yet mean dog, and lots and lots of unsavory characters.  Ritchie's script is full of terrific one-liners and spouts of hilarious dialog, along with some very interesting takes on things such as the birth of Jesus and the meaning of the word &quot;Nemesis.&quot;<br />One thing in great films always sticks out, making the film evern better, and in SNATCH, it's the music.  It's a great blend of pop, techno, rock, and off-beat classical.  Every character seems to have some sort of theme song that is perfectly matched with their personality.<br />Overall, SNATCH is great fun.  It's funny, smart, fast paced, and never bogged down in its own pomposity, as many ventures into this genre are.  Ritchie, to me, is like Christopher McQuarrie (THE USUAL SUSPECTS, THE WAY OF THE GUN).  He knows he is good in his genre, but it will be extremely interesting to see both of these great writer/directors as they move into unkown territory of film.
B00004TWZF|5.0|This movie is inspiring in a way that few movies are.  Usually, when 'inspiration' is involved, the hero or heroin achieves some hard to attain goal.  Here Jacques, like a Buddhist monk, is no longer interested in the world. A better world awaits him in the Big Blue.  The viewer is taken on a surprising journey. For all his extraordinary attunement to the sea and the dolphins, Jacques is like a naief child when it comes to communication with the world. At first he experiences this is a shortcoming. But when faced with the choice of wordly love and the 'other side', he comes to see the depth and fullness of his world below water.  The movie has several spiritual metaphores, such as Jacques ability to slow his breath and concentrate all his energy in the brain - a feat also attained by mystics and yogis -, and the rope by which the competitors dive to the depths of the ocean - an 'upside down' symbolism of the spine. From this angle, the final scene is his release from all bondage.  Lighting up the serious theme are some totally hilarious scenes, and a friendship that endures all. I love this movie. With Crouching Tiger and the Matrix it is in my top three.
B00003CXIY|4.0|This movie was really funny. I gave it 4 stars because the comedy kind of dies off. This is a great movie for young, horny guys because if you can get away with watching it then you better be ready for a lot of nudity. The funniest parts are when a fat guys has some fun with french toast, when a guy gets some 'help' at a sperm donor clinic, and when a guy steals a bus from a blind lady. Overall this is a gross and funny movie but if you're offended by naked women and things like that you should stray away from this movie.
0671027573|5.0|MR. PERFECT is not the hero of this riveting, explosive masterpiece. The title alludes to a list of assets that Jaine Bright and her 3 best friends have decided the perfect man must possess. Some of the contributions to the list are serious but some are just thrown in for fun and the result of a few drinks and the bawdy moment they're having. However, the list leaks out and instantly causes notoriety for the four fun-loving women involved. Some people take it with the light-hearted fun that it was intended for; others find it insulting and sexiest. So the four find themselves either being cheered or spurned because of the list. But, one person reacts with murderous rage and the plot is set as Jaine and her friends realize the innocent list they created has put their lives in danger. <br />The nail-biting suspense is balanced out with the quick, off-beat humor of Jaine and the sexy presense of her next door neighbor, Detective  Sam Donovan.  With all the ingredients for good story telling that Linda Howard employs in MR. PERFECT, she comes up with the, uhhhhh......perfect story. This book should have come with a warning though: Once started, you may not be able to put it down until the last page.
0679809015|5.0|This was one of the first books I bought for my daughter.  Actually I bought it while she was still in my womb!  I decided to get it after seeing a child having the best time reading it with her mother at one of my pre-natal visits.<br />Needless to say my daughter absolutely loves this book.  She is now going on 15 months old and picks this book daily to read over and over and over....<br />The pictures are simple, bright and clear.  She loves to lift the flaps and see which animal is waiting for her and we both giggle our hearts out as we make the sounds together.<br />A pure joy of a book for both child and adult.  <br />This book, I safely can say is her favorite (and one of mine too).
B00003CXP1|5.0|This was a movie that I have heard so much about that I thought, &quot;oh no...overkill.&quot;  I am after all, a very bitter grape with a cynical eye towards marketing.  <br />But to treat myself for my birthday, I ordered this and 4 other DVD's (you will be hearing reviews of those too...but you gotta find 'em!).  And tonight, with another grape-y friend of mine, I watched it.<br />Let me just say, there will be SPOILERS so please read at your own discretion.<br />The first time you see those quick cuts of the syringe filling, the eyes dilating, the cotton balls, and the sighs of pleasure in the background, it's inevitable...you think &quot;wow! COOL!&quot;<br />But as the movie progresses and these 4 characters become less and less human, it ain't so cool no more.  You see that montage of cuts over and over again and each time you see it, it means more doom.  You start thinking &quot;oh please, Harry..please don't do that..please...&quot;  It becomes ingrained in your head that this is no longer fun..it's a habit...it's an addiction..and the fact that it is shot so magnetically, you can't turn your head away no matter how much you start hating it.  Much like drug addiction itself.<br />Ellen Burstyn, in that scene with Jared Leto in her apartment...when she talks about that red dress and Seymour and her hopes and dreams for Harry...I don't think you can get any more heartbreaking than that...her pathetic nature, her descent into madness, it's all up there and you can't stop watching.  This is a woman on the cusp and you have no doubt in your mind she's going to go over...what an incredible performance in this scene...<br />Marion's prostitution and transformation into a full-blown junkie...you love her so much, and you hate her too for doing this to herself.  Her degradation at the end was so un-sexual and I have no clue as to why the MPAA made such a big deal out of it...but what it was, and this is why I think they censored it and slapped it with an NC-17...wasthat it was NOT senseless....this scene is in there to show her humiliation, not her pleasure.  And that this will surely not be the last time she does this.  And sex that isn't mindless is not palatable to us sheep.  Thus, the NC-17.  What a pity we are treated like morons.<br />Marlon Wayans, what a surprise...'nuff said...and Jared Leto...the center of the film....never thought he had it in him.  When he turns his head away and suggests that Marion goes on the date (trick?) with Arnold for money...my heart broke.<br />Add this to the visual style of the movie, the music, the sound...believe me folks...screw the MPAA and what they think is ok to see and not ok to see...this is an IMPORTANT film...on a critical level, you will never see performances stronger than these in any movie released in the last 2 years.  On a social level...once you see this...once you see these characters (and that ARM!) go from healthy and loving to wisps of souls, you will never ever consider doing drugs...and if you already do, you will reconsider.  Unless you are Harry, Marion, Tyrone, or Sara...chracters who can never turn back.<br />The moral?<br />There is a point where salvation will never find you. So don't even start walking in that direction.<br />Excuse me now, kiddies. I have to find my Swingline and scrape my heart off the floor.
B00003CXDZ|2.0|I had heard that one would either love or hate this movie, but in my case, I'm right in the middle; I would actually give this 2 1/2 stars if I could. I loved the musical numbers; I was afraid that the modern songs wouldn't mesh with a 'period piece', but I was pleasantly surprised. I will never hear 'Like a Virgin' or 'Roxanne' in the same way ever again! I also thought the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan take-off was hilarious. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman gave incredible performances.<br />On the negative side, the last half of the movie is way too slow considering the frenetic pace of the first half. We all know the ending from the very beginning, so why drag it out? Major editing should have been done, in my opinion. Also, although I am a big romantic, I disliked being force-fed the love theme. The &quot;the greatest thing you'll ever learn...&quot; line was repeated too many times, so the end of the movie just left a bad taste in my mouth.<br />Overall, I'd watch it again only if I could fast-forward from song to song. This isn't a great movie, but an eclectic and opulent music video.
0780624890|4.0|Great action packed film.  Sure there are a few plot holes but if you're looking for Matrix-like action, then this is a great movie.  This one is a lot of fun.
0385486804|5.0|This has to be one of the most touching books I have ever read. For a whole month at work, whenever I could spare a moment I read this book with fascination, the words brought to life the mind of one who died in remote Alaskan wilderness. At twenty-three Alex Mcandless walked away from the Campus of Emory university with a 4.0 GPA and took to the road. To learn what no book could teach and what no one could show you, the frailty of human life and how truly valuable it is. In his death we have been given a glimpse into a world most of us never see, a real world not dominated by television and commercialism. Any person with an adventurous spirit or an open mind would love this book.
B00005ASIL|4.0|Lovingly assembled and carefully remastered, this collection stands head and shoulders above other Tull collections.  It's a mix of older and newer material, sequenced for listening rather than archiving (i.e. the songs aren't arrenged chronologically). From Ian Anderson's brief but insightful liner notes: &quot;Mixing up the tempos, key and time signatures made, I think, for a more interesting programme.&quot; Right he is!<br />I'll leave selection debates to future customers, saying only that the major hits are all here and this listener at least is delighted with the album tracks, including &quot;Broadsword,&quot; &quot;Sweet Dream,&quot; &quot;The Witch's Promise,&quot; and &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; (the latter has been cropped to roughly one third its original length, but tastefully so).<br />The mastering is by and large excellent, despite some overly judicious applications of treble equalization, most prominently on &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (which, by the way, was trimmed from 45 minutes to 3). For most of the album, timbres are natural, bass is taut, and the tracks haven't had the life squeezed from them by heavy dynamic compression (which keeps everything LOUD, all them time, robbing music of its natural swells and cadences).<br />To my ears, it sounds like the music may have been de-hissed and subsequently re-equalized to compensate for now-missing high frequencies. I regard this as a Bad Thing, but even still I must concede that the producers did a fine job (no producers or engineers are credited!). The music on this disc sounds better than any other Tull CD I've heard, excepting the amazing and now out of print Mobile Fidelity gold discs.<br />The booklet includes small pictures of the 23 contributing Tull members from across the years. The only things missing are track-by-track annotations giving us date, album, and musician and production credits.<br />For the most part, though, the music speaks very nicely for itself! Whether you're seeking an introduction to the band or a refresher course in its peculiar brand of folky, English &quot;Ba Roque&quot; progressive rock, *The Very Best Of* is the disc you want.
B0000026JR|5.0|Back in 1988, in New York, I received an advanced cassette copy of what was the first Riot album since&quot; Born In America&quot;. &quot;Thundersteel&quot; remained in my cassette deck till it literally wore out. This was Riot's first foray into the speed/power metal genre and their efforts were astounding. Featuring a revamped lineup with the exception of mainstay Mark Reale, the new Riot took heavy metal to new technical heights. The title track is absolute 95 MPH speed with a terribly catchy riff. The solo is long and classically oriented with a familliar Accept &quot;Fast As A Shark&quot; like segment. Tony Moore's voice soars high and clear over everything. The bass work by Don Van Stavern is excellent as is the precision drumming by Bobby &quot;The Zombie&quot; Jarzombek.&quot; Fight Or Fall&quot; continues the frantic pace. &quot;Fight or fall, in the name of the children, fight or fall in the name of us all&quot; screams Moore, and he means it too! &quot;Sign of the Crimson Storm&quot; is a much slower Sabbath type offering that is excellent as well. &quot;Flight of the Warrior&quot; and &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot; take us on the manic ride again at 85 MPH. How could a metalhead not love lyrics like &quot;Heat seeker flash headed straight for your heart, one finds the mark and a fireball rocks the sky; men and machines sweet and deadly we are, we rule the wind on titanium wings&quot;.&quot; Johnny's Back&quot; is next up. It is very catchy and probably could have been a radio hit for Riot. &quot;Tell the boys to step aside, tell the girls to form a line, the king is back to claim the land again&quot;. &quot;Bloodstreets&quot; is a fine ballad, slow and yet powerful at the same time, another &quot;should have been&quot; radio hit. &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; is really the only weak song on the album and it seems like the band needed to fill up four minutes of time on the record. &quot;Thundersteel&quot; concludes in creepy fashion with &quot;Buried Alive (The Tell Tale Heart)&quot;, a story of a man who awakens in a coffin at his own funeral. You even hear the sounds of the wake going on outside the coffin! While not a great song, it is good and brings to a close a near-great effort by a very fine group of musicians. This album was not given the promotion it required by CBS and while it charted in Billboard, it died a quick death. The band of course continued battling onward, fighting the good fight and never compromised. Thundersteel is a fine representation of Riot in 1988, or for that matter in 1998. Spend your money on this excellent piece of music.
B00003CXRM|5.0|So refreshing to see this film when I did....when inane movies like Pearl Harbor clogged the multiplexes I caught this gem at a low budget art house. True, I have recently been introduced to the genius that is the Coens and have been going ape for every thing they have done, but I think this film exceptional and would recommend it to Coen fans and non Coen fans alike.        A good comic performance from the usualy flacid Clooney, usual brilliance from Turturro, and the best of the three, Tim Blake Nelson tie this Homer-based epic together. The synthesis of the writing, directing, and acting was complete and that is at the very heart of good theatre/film- the point when you can't tell who is responsible for the brilliance you are watching.     The Coens have outdone themselves with this hugely comic and ultimately moving romp that leaves nothing left untied, and no plots left unwrapped and explained. Nothing in this film is there without meaning and purpose.      A hillarious supporting performance from John Goodman is only one of the many laurels this film holds in it's ever so eccentric boughs. Immediately arriving on my top ten films list, besides being brilliant, this film inadvertantly contains on of my favorite sequences in film- a thrilling mix of the KKK, the wizard of oz, and a busby-berkley parody.      The Coens have yet to do a commentary track (that being my favorite DVD aspect) but the producers of this DVD have covered it with other goodies- two featurettes and a couple of smaller behind the scenes type deals.      I shouldn't say that the film is brilliant. I should just say that I love it, and that I would highly recommend the film (and the purchasing of the DVD) to anyone who loves great art.
0399226907|5.0|I love all of Eric's books and so does my son - this book helps him count and he loves what happens - this is an EXCELLENT book!
B000056VIY|4.0|I bought Jennifer's debut CD, and liked it very much. My only problem was that I felt like there were repetitive Spanish songs on the album, which are not my taste. On &quot;J.Lo&quot;, it is the same deal. &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot;, &quot;Play&quot;, &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;, &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;, and &quot;I'm Real&quot; are all really great songs, but the album seems to go downhill from there. I thought it was worth a buy, and people who enjoyed her last album will like this one as much.
0345440757|5.0|I bought this book 2 months after my second son was born. I do not even look at the other books I bought while suffering from severe sleep deprivation with my first son! Had I followed her guidelines with my first child I am certain life would have been easier. None of the other methods we tried worked. A great middle of the road approach. I hear she is writing another book on toddlers...I hope it is out soon!
015650300X|5.0|It's difficult for me to write a complete review, as I am still an inexperienced French student. Having read the book as a child (in English, of course), I can rant and rave about the storyline, the message, the fact that it can be enjoyed on different levels by children and adults.<br />What stands out to me about this version is that it's in the original French, and what seemed bizzare in English works well in the author's native tongue. This is one of the best books ever written, and if the option exists, reading it in French would be the best option.
B00005A1PR|5.0|A friend of mine introduce me to India Arie, several months ago. My friend had her CD, and invited me over to hear it. I was truly mesmerized by the passion and delivery of this outstanding songtress. Then last week India attended a benefit in Newark, N.J., with former President Bill Clinton, and Mariah Carey, and it all fell into place. Her wholesomeness, style and class just exuded from every inch of this great young Diva. She is definitely a singing force to be recond with, and her CD is a must for anyone who truly loves to hear music not only with their ears, but with their hearts, too.   TJBJ
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M. has come along way from their humble roots as an Athens garage band. This album is NO DOUBT, in my opinion, theitr finest work. Being a huge R.E.M. fan, I can find gems on any record that they put out, versus a music reviewer who throuws out a whole CD with 1 or 2 bad songs. But this CD is a reviewer and a fan album. With such hits on it as &quot;Everybody Hurts, &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Man on The Moon&quot;, this record reaches far beyond their club, days and into the radio spotlight. My favorite song from the album is &quot;The Sinderwinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;. It is a fast paced rock song, that still can keep it's peacefulness.<br />This is a definate must, not just for R.E.M. fans, but for ANY sort of Music fan. <br />Heck, Puffy even covered &quot;Everybody Hurts.&quot;
B00005B4GU|4.0|We are at the epox of the end of music, as we know it. Pop bands such as backstreet, 98 degrees,Britney Spears etc.. These &quot;bands&quot; are created by faceless companies to extend their evil reach of power. The people who &quot;write&quot; these songs are no musicians or composers they are advertisers. These advertisers want to know what teens want then force them down the throat of mainstream culture and to pass it off as music. The music is worse than candy and rots the brains of little girls and boys. Radiohead, with a handful of other bands out there are real musicians that are willing to experment and try new things. If a song fails to be played on the radio who cares? Sure this is not the best Radiohead album out there. It's my personally believe that Kid-A was perhaps one of the greatest albums of all time. It pushed the envelope every way it can be pushed. You could call Amnesiac, Kid-B yet it's a over simplification. Amnesiac, has a much different overall feel with more guitars then Kid-A.  Track 3 Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,9 Hunting Bears, and 10 Like spinning plates are nearly unbearable to listen to. But the rest are just perfect. (Oh, yeah 7 morning bell is a junk version from Kid-A not bad nor all that great) Long story short support real musicians this cd is worth the 15 bucks.
B0000067X1|4.0|The tiny Balearic isle of Tago Mago came up for sale again last year.  I was tempted, but as the asking price was well in excess of $1 million, it seemed an excessive means of commemorating one of the weirdest albums I know.  This was the album that friends at school used to play to assert their individuality, but they didn't play it too often.<br />This album is a museum piece, a critical juncture in the formation of what some derisively call Krautrock.  You can detect its influence on the likes of Robert Wyatt's 'Rock Bottom', early Gentle Giant and Radiohead's 'Kid A' &amp; 'Amnesiac', as well as countless others.  But just because it played a vital part in rock history doesn't mean that you have to own it.  Albums tend to mean very different things to people who were there at the time than to new recruits, thirty years on....<br />There is plenty to annoy your parents on 'Tago Mago', but frankly little to enjoy yourself.  If you want Can music that you can really enjoy, play to friends, work to, drive to, and appreciate for many,many years, then my personal five-star Can recommendation is 1973's 'Future Days'.  In comparison, 'Tago Mago' sounds very raw indeed.
B00003CXFU|4.0|It's sure hard to find any opinions about this movie that aren't knee-jerk. On the one hand, the movie and its hero are attacked by people who don't seem to think corporations can do any wrong. On the other, it's defended by people who seem to think having a Good Heart is all that's necessary to Defend The Environment and the Public Health.<br /><br />Well, the true story involves _both_ junk science _and_ sleazy corporate practices. And whether or not the &quot;science&quot; in the movie is defended by actual scientists (which it isn't), Erin Brockovich was and is a hero.<br /><br />One hard fact is that hexavalent chromium probably wasn't responsible for all the injuries attributed to it in this film. Yes, it's a carcinogen and it's dangerous when inhaled. But so far as I know, there's no evidence linking it to all the problems detailed in this movie when it's ingested as part of the drinking-water supply. (Not that I'd want to risk it myself, mind you.)<br /><br />But another, and equally important, hard fact is that Pacific Gas and Electric _did_ screw up big-time. The company knew Cr(VI) was a health hazard, _didn't_ know exactly what the risks were (at that time nobody did -- in fact we still don't), failed to take obvious (and, for better or worse, EPA-mandated) precautions against polluting the local groundwater with the stuff, and then lied to everybody about everything. They were not heroes, and Brockovich did uncover their wrongdoing.<br /><br />Brockovich, as I said, was and is a hero, and she is well portrayed in this film. I am not ordinarily a fan of Julia Roberts (in fact, frankly, I haven't liked her in anything but _Steel Magnolias_). But she does a nice job here.<br /><br />The movie, while (I'm told) varying in places from the facts of the actual story, manages to avoid falling into at least _some_ obvious cliches. Far, for example, from portraying a triumph of the &quot;little guy&quot; over the big corporate baddies, the film makes clear that the law firm for which Brockovich works _could not have won_ without the aid of a big-corporate-baddie lawyer (Peter Coyote) with both money and toxic-torts experience.<br /><br />Brockovich doesn't much like this, but it's one of several points on which her knee-jerk, legally inexperienced judgment is simply shown to be wrong. Another is in her initial opposition to binding arbitration, a point handled nicely by Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who is marvelous throughout). And there's another cliche successfully avoided: refreshingly, the fact that Brockovich's &quot;heart is in the right place&quot; doesn't magically make her an expert who out-lawyers the lawyers at every turn.<br /><br />It's probably impossible to avoid comparing this film to _A Civil Action_, which involves a somewhat similar set of facts. But unlike that other movie (which heavily fictionalized Jan Schlichtmann in any event), at bottom this is a character study of Brockovich herself. And, presented &quot;warts and all,&quot; she is much more interesting than ideologues in _either_ camp would like to allow.<br /><br />She is most assuredly a very refreshing movie hero. Sassy, foul-mouthed, and occasionally downright mean (watch, e.g., her nasty comments to Conchatta Ferrell's character), she is also hard-working, (mostly) responsible, and hungry for justice. No cardboard cutout, she's a complicated person with genuine flaws, and Roberts plays her as such.<br /><br />The real fun is in watching her learn to put her &quot;flaws&quot; to work on the side of the good guys. It's a joy to watch her win -- against the usual Hollywood gang of weaselly attorneys (including a condescending Miss Priss who has a hard time believing Brockovich has anything on the ball at all), against PG&amp;E itself, and against the shortcomings that have thus far kept her from success. It's impossible not to like her and root for her.<br /><br />A satisfying film overall, then (and one that incidentally succeeds in many respectsin which the heavy-handed and absolutely pathetic _Pay It Forward_ fails utterly). Many reviewers will probably disagree with me here, but I hope Julia Roberts never goes back to romantic comedies.in which the heavy-handed and absolutely pathetic _Pay It Forward_ fails utterly). Many reviewers will probably disagree with me here, but I hope Julia Roberts never goes back to romantic comedies.
B00003CWLF|3.0|An excellent story, well told but there were almost no Thai/Siamese people in the cast. Another example of arrogant producers assuming that an audience can not tell the difference between races of people or that they do not care. A scan of the cast list, reveals that most of the cast were in fact Chinese. Does it matter? Yes, to me it does, when I watch a movie about Thailand, I expect to see Thai people, little wonder that the movie was not a hit in Thailand, I imagine that they are insulted by it. I was surprised by Jodie Foster in this role, I have always liked her but never imagined her as an English woman, she was most convincing.
6302293553|5.0|Monty Python took a hell of a chance making a full lenght motion picture, as the simple production and mostly strictly six man skits which characterized their TV show and their live performances since 1968 gave their brilliant scripts and acting their full power. With the Flying Circus behind them, however, and John Cleese already starting to work on his own project with his wife (Fawlty Towers), Monty Python decided to take that chance, and it proved to be worth it, mainly due to the fact that Monty Python and the Holy Grail looks more like a collection of skits than a single story; any attempt to follow the storyline will be quite disappointing. However, almost every scene is brilliant by itself, and the movie provides some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in comedy history.<br />The perfect timing and team work of the Monty Python crew, which made 'Flying Circus' one of the most popular shows in history, was transferred well to the big screen. Additional actors were kept to a minimum, so each of the Pythonists played several parts. As usual, the casting is wonderful, and each of the six actors brings life to all his characters, as each one gets one or two great scenes to show what he has to offer. Graham Chapman was given the role of the straight man (sort of like Zeppo Marx only funnier) and does a great job in the part of King Arthur, as well as an unforgettable short appearence as God (&quot;Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy...&quot;) Terry Gilliam is, as usual, not given a very big part in the movie, but does a great work on his very few lines as both Patsy, Arthur's trusty steed (&quot;It's only a model.&quot;) and the keeper of the Bridge of Death, as well a short appearence as himself (The Animator). His animation sequences on this movie are his absolute best. Director Terry Jones does a wonderful Sir Bedevere, supplying the brilliant witch scene, as well as the unforgettable Prince Herbert. Michael Palin is a great Sir Galahad, but is more memorable as Dennis (&quot;Help! Help! I'm being repressed!&quot;) and of course the leader of the Knights Who Say Ni. Eric Idle is dreadfuly funny as usual as Sir Robin, and also as Roger the Srubber, Brother Maynard, the Dead Collector (&quot;Bring out your dead!&quot;) and Concorde. And most of all, John Cleese, making not only a wonderful Sir Launcelot, but also supply some of the film's most memorable moments as the newt guy, Tim the Wizard, the rude French soldier and of course the Black Knight (&quot;It's just a flesh wound!&quot;)<br />The comedic work of the Monty Python team, their scripts and their timing are flawless. Python's humor is one that works on familiarity and not on surprise, and so I still enjoy it after watching it about twenty times - it's the perfect kind of thing to own on video.

B000002UCN|2.0|Unless you stopped listening to the radio in 1976, THE BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON will seem half-baked. Certainly anyone who thinks of the ex-Beatle's biggest records would look for several songs not yet made when this collection came out.<br />The June 28, 2001, reviewer's list of songs that should appear on a proper George Harrison hits album covers the biggest tunes of Harrison's career. But even in the context of the Harrison work available when THE BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON was released, why not fill it out with solo album tracks instead of Beatles songs? Oh, well, too late now.
6302293553|5.0|Monty Python took a hell of a chance making a full lenght motion picture, as the simple production and mostly strictly six man skits which characterized their TV show and their live performances since 1968 gave their brilliant scripts and acting their full power. With the Flying Circus behind them, however, and John Cleese already starting to work on his own project with his wife (Fawlty Towers), Monty Python decided to take that chance, and it proved to be worth it, mainly due to the fact that Monty Python and the Holy Grail looks more like a collection of skits than a single story; any attempt to follow the storyline will be quite disappointing. However, almost every scene is brilliant by itself, and the movie provides some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in comedy history.<br />The perfect timing and team work of the Monty Python crew, which made 'Flying Circus' one of the most popular shows in history, was transferred well to the big screen. Additional actors were kept to a minimum, so each of the Pythonists played several parts. As usual, the casting is wonderful, and each of the six actors brings life to all his characters, as each one gets one or two great scenes to show what he has to offer. Graham Chapman was given the role of the straight man (sort of like Zeppo Marx only funnier) and does a great job in the part of King Arthur, as well as an unforgettable short appearence as God (&quot;Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy...&quot;) Terry Gilliam is, as usual, not given a very big part in the movie, but does a great work on his very few lines as both Patsy, Arthur's trusty steed (&quot;It's only a model.&quot;) and the keeper of the Bridge of Death, as well a short appearence as himself (The Animator).

B000046PVN|5.0|Yes, this is a tremendous 2 CD set and worthy of any collection.  But something else you should consider is that the newly released Superman: The Movie DVD includes a much sought after isolated score of the entire film.  This means you can watch the movie with only the music playing and nothing else.  I have listened to it many times on my sound system and it is fantastic!  I'm not 100% sure on this but I believe that there is even music on the DVD that didn't make the CD release and this is because of the added footage that was placed back in the film.  Among those is a wonderful scene of Superman, back at the fortress of solitude, discussing how good it felt to help mankind to his father, Jor-El.  When Jor-El tells his son how proud he is of him and that he wishes he could hug him, John Williams does this great peace that really effects me everytime I hear it as Superman holds out his arms to his father's image which then disappears.  I don't believe that this is on the 2CD set, but if it is I must've missed it.  Either way, if you love the music of Superman and love the movie as well, buying the DVD will solve both of your problems.  That being said, owning this 2 CD set isn't a bad way to go as well.  But considering that the DVD is much cheaper to buy than the 2 CD set, you may want to rethink your decision.  And those without DVD players might consider getting one, especially when you're missing out on such special features as this one.  Sometimes isolated scores are the only way to get your hands on the music.  Trevor Jones composed the music for Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal and the soundtrack on CD is nowhere to be found.  But thanks to the DVD, an isolated score was included.  DVD is definately the wave of the future.  Let's hope one day that DVD sound players are introduced to replace CD players.  After all, you can store over 140 minutes of information on one side of a DVD, and twice that if it is Dual-Layared.  But until that future catches up with us,just enjoy John William's score for Superman on any format you can find!
B00005KHEU|5.0|My sister got this record when she was 19 and I,9 years old. To me is the best record this band has ever had,and I had owned in vynil,tape and,now,cd. I still listen to it,at age 31. My advice is that if yoy want to remember good old times,buy this cd,if you don't like all the song (and I bet you will),you still end up having &quot;Last Train To London&quot;,wich was a hit.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I first heard of Dido back in 1999 when the show Roswell premiered on the WB.The song &quot;Here With Me&quot; is the theme song to the show.I asked around to find out who this wonderful singer was and finally got a responce.I went out searching for the CD and couldn't find it anywhere until months later.I kept thinking about buying it and eventually did.I am so glad I did,because if I didn't I would be missing out on one amazing CD.The songs are all beautifully written.Her voice is absolutly beautiful.There is not one bad song on this CD.Stand out tracks are &quot;Here With Me&quot;,&quot;All You Want&quot;,&quot;My Lovers Gone&quot;,&quot;Take My Hand&quot;,and &quot;Isobel&quot;.Don't pass this CD up in the store.It is all amazing.
B00005AACC|4.0|I enjoyed Mission: Impossible 2 a lot.  The plot was good, there were many surprises, the action was well set, the script was good, the chick was hot, and the soundtrack is my absolute favorite I have heard.  The one thing which I think could be better was Tom Cruise.  Sure, he is good for action and all the girls think he is good looking.  But, he is just not like the original series actors.  Such as, when he got the surprise rocket in the beginning, he didn't treat it like it was anything.  I think he should have been really surprised, much more than he was.  And later, when he was told to go in to the building with the time locked door plates, he took it the wrong way.  He should have been more afraid yet cool of the idea, instead of, &quot;Sure, I can.&quot;  Beyond that, it was a great movie.
B000059XY3|5.0|Batman Forever was, in my opinion, the best Batman movie made.  Val Kilmer was good at Batman, Chris O'Donnel was very good, and the two villains, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as Riddler, made an excellent duo.  There were funny points in the movie, but it wasn't like Batman and Robin where they made it too funny.  The plot was good, showing that Bruce Wayne had to decide between devoting his life to one person or two many people-those in need.  After the struggle, and with input from Robin, he decided to do both by sticking as Batman.  Also, the action was very well done, the special effects were good, and the movie was all around a classic.

0385501560|5.0|Choke is different from other books by Chuck Palahniuk in certain ways. It did not start at the end. Less emphasis is paid to consumerism. But it is definite Palahniuk, no one can argue about it. Victor mancini is modern day saviour and he lives up to it in certain ways. The most impressive character is his mother, Ida mancini. Mr Palahniuk is definitely one of best writers alive. Atleast he made me buy the hardcover. I can't even remember when was the last time I bought hardcover fiction.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie was put together in a very colorful way.  Many of my friend's mothers were all worried about [the] contact.  Well I must tell you that there was no sexual contact and nothing out of the ordinary. To me this movie was very nice a well put with a good story line and lesson of love, truth, beauty, and freedom. Ewan Mcgregor was very magnifecient.  Him and Nicole Kidman made a wonderful couple and sounded beautiful together.  I owned the soundtrack before I saw the movie.  But after seeing it i appreciated it even more.  It had some comedy in it too.  There is one thing that I did not like about the movie, but I wouldn't want to give it away to anyone.  So inconclusion it was wonderful but if you cry at movies you may want to bring some tissues!
0380002930|5.0|You will love this book--it's as simple as that.  I was on a train to Biggleswade, England, a couple weeks ago, and it was sunset.  There were a bunch of bunnies out in a brussels sprouts field--no doubt at silflay--and it reminded me that it was once again time to read Watership Down.  This isn't a book one reads; it's a book one inhabits.  You will be transported!  Adams has the most incredible touch with the English language--his main characters are so gentle, so touching they'll make you weep.  There's savagery in it as well, which can even be shocking at times.  And the tales that are interspersed within the novel are works unto themselves (You'll just roar at Rowsy Woof!)  I'm an American who now lives in England, and the portrayal of the gentle English countryside is worth the read alone.  You will not be disappointed--read this book at once!  (P.S.  To this day I still refer to the old heap of a Dodge that I had in high school as &quot;The Hrududu!&quot;)
B00003CXDZ|5.0|have absolute no idea why people are panning this film.  i am a big fan of rock operas which this movie clearly is.  The direction was in one word marvelous.  the story can be compaired to shakespear in love but alot more exciting and captivating. the singing was surprisingly good. for someone who owns 30 municals on cd and seen 6 live i know what i'm talking about. some people said they walked out because they couldnt stand the singing, its a musical for cryin outloud of course there will be singing and dancing involved. I've seen the movie 4 times and will see it again most likely, if you havent seen it go see it in the theatre, its the only way to experience this movie.
B00005A1PR|4.0|I'm glad that there's something positive, truthful, fresh, and sexy that I can listen too.  Erykah's hypnotic anguish has to take a back seat to India's soulfully honest renditions of life and love (of self).  The beats are lush and flavorful and the lyrics are right on.  If you don't have it then go get it.  If you have it then buy one for a friend.  We need to promote the positive and refute the negative.  I pray that India (and the like) stay around for a while.
B00003CXS4|4.0|devilishly funny movie.  it takes a while to get use to the talking since the heavy british accent do make it a bit hard to understand at times.  especially brad pitts character, i still have trouble remembering the movie because i just didnt have a clue about what was said in some of it.  the story is the same setup as lock stock and 2 smoking barrels but has a very quintin tarrentino kind of feel to it.  the ending was a little hard to swallow but still very clever.  go rent it or buy it its a good movie.  the special features are kind of lacking though in my oppinion so if you want to buy it i suggest the vhs.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|Wonderfully done, I cannot say enough about it. The plot was anything but cliche, the characters memorable, and the entire storyline was done without even one scene containing a half nude female. An excellent movie.
0780622553|5.0|if you want to watch a movie that will keep you guessing right up till the final minutes, then this is for you.  a stylistic masterpeice, no wonder it got such high praise from siskel and ebert.  listen to the commentary track it is an education in film history.  the movie fills you with a genuine sence of anxiety that you would get with any good action sci fi flick but the charaters are so well developed that you can really understand and identify with what they are going through emotionally.  one thing i didnt like as much was the ending.  they explained the movie in the last 20 minutes so if you missed it you might very well have just not seen it at all.  but my god what a fun ride it was.  see this movie but try to find the biggest screen you can because it was ment to be experienced.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This CD only has a few swear words. It is the best CD out there though. AROUND THE WORDLD- Rocks. But what is with the &quot;Ding Dang Dong Doo Ding Dong Ding Dang&quot;? One of there 5 singles. (9/10) PARALELL UNIVERSE- Nice guitar and drums and a great chourus. (8/10) SCAR TISUE- Another one of there 5 singles, Scar Tisue is a rather mellowed down song with a nice guitar and weird chourus. (10/10)  OTHERSIDE- Another one of there singles, Otherside is one of the best on the album.(10/10) GET ON TOP- A very good song with a punk/rockish sound to it. (9/10) CLIFORNACATION- Another one of the 5 hits, this song kicks ...It has a really good guitar solo. (10/10) EASILY- A really good song about how everything must go easily. (8/10) all the other songs rule
B00000896M|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it! When I first bought this Metal CD, I was a bit reluctant to listen to it because I'm not that much of a metal fan, I thought that all metal bands were a bunch of screaming yahoos and had filthy and obscene lyrics in their songs. When I listened to this album, boy was I ever wrong! This heavy metal album isn't just any heavy metal album, it's an epic fantasy metal album, and this epic fantasy metal album is based on one of the greatest fantasy sagas of all time, &quot;The LOTR Saga&quot;. It is based on the first novel in the LOTR saga called &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; , and man, dies Blind Guardian ever do a good job of interpreting this novel through their songs!! My favorite songs on the album are &quot;Nightfall&quot; (in which you can clearly visualize the lament of the Noldor elves), &quot;Time Stands Still at the Iron Hill&quot; (which excellently depicts the epic battle between the Dark Lord Morgoth and Fingolfin), and &quot;A Dark Passage&quot;, which I like to call &quot;Smash Down the Light!&quot; which clearly expresses Morgoth's rage and dark desire to pour out his revenge upon the forces of the Light!   I must recommend this album to all fantasy and heavy metal bands alike! Definitely buy this album!   Oh, and if your a bit like I was and don't like metal, and think this is just a typical metal album with obscene lyrics and screaming so loud and ugly that you can't understand a word of the song, don't worry, Blind Guardian doesn't do this type of stuff, and when there IS screaming, it's there to express a character's lament or rage in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

0452282152|1.0|Did Tracy Chevalier ever read a novel? Though she attempts to shackle her readers to the text by using quaint historical details, it is clear she knows little of life in Europe during the 17th century and has indulged in only a cursory reading of the history of the period. Of course, the plot is not interesting enough to hold us on its own. <br />-Women in Girl- Flattened into 2 dimensions, anyone looks turgid, without dynamism or emotion. Catharina was a witch and the protagonist a victimized, though \\"clever\\" survivor. Gimme a break, man. Does any character possess the faculty of logic? Where is the author's examination of the economics behind decisions made by her women? What are the trade-offs that made the characters who they were? An interest in that might have repaired some of the damage done to readers of this novel who will come away with the lesson that there is only great good and extreme evil in the world, not process or human agency.<br />  -Use of Language- I can not point to one satisfactory turn of phrase in Girl. A deadening rhythm of medium-length sentences prevails, lulling the reader's mind further into inactivity. This is like watching an A&E movie when you can't press mute. Chevalier, go take a dose of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, espresso, you need it, girl.<br />  -Hero Worship- As we know precious little about Vermeer's character by the end of Chevalier's book, the novel appears to be an enterprise of hero worship. What criticism does Chevalier have to offer? What accolades to the artist? The only position Chevailer takes in the novel is that of a mundane observer. Fine. Vermeer can be meticulous, not money-hungry. But make it interesting. Make it original! Observe something worthy of our attention and our $15!! Vermeer was a \\"genius\\" in her book. How did he get like that? We've seen his paintings already. Don't repeat what they look like to us. Tell us what motivated the man. What his political inclinations at \\"the guild\\" were, what he atefor supper, what his family told him at supper. We know he's respected by art critics already. You don't need to reaffirm that for us. <br />The fact that novels like this get published and turn into best sellers is an insult to American culture.
0385501560|5.0|Ever since I carried my jaw out of the theatre from &quot;Fight Club&quot; I've been a fan of Chuck's (even though he didn't make the movie.) After readig Choke, I'd have to say it's his most entertaining book since...well since Fight Club, of course.  But don't expect this book to be Fight Club 2, because Choke's structure is the complete opposite of Fight Club.  Fight Club was only great because of its ending, yet Choke is great because of everything but the ending.  Choke was one of the only books I was able to read without looking to see what page I was on.  I enjoyed reading every page.  The chapters are extremely short (about 4 pages), each bouncing back and forth between situations which I found rather refreshing.  As I approached the last two chapters, I was afraid he might try to tie the book up into a drastic ending like Fight Club, but, instead, it ends without really having an ending at all.  This might sound like a waste of time to read, but I would, personally, rather enjoy 250 pages than a 5 page ending.
B000056K04|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge DMB fan.  When I first listened to 'Everyday', I was disappointed.  Like many other people, all I heard was Dave's voice over lifeless electric guitar riffs.  After several listens, I have to say that 'Everyday' has become one of my favorite studio DMB albums.<br />1) I Did It - I couldn't stand this song until I imagined the smile on Dave's face as he was singing it.  He Did It, alright, he made some stylistic changes, damn the critics.<br />2) When The World Ends - Very, very sexy song.. lyrics reminiscient of Crash Into Me.. &quot;Your legs don't work 'cause you want me, so you just lie spread to the wall..&quot;  My only qualm with this song is the placement on the CD.. I think it would have been more appropriate at the end.<br />3) The Space Between - Easily the worst song on Everyday.  It just sounds corny to me.<br />4) Dreams Of Our Fathers - The verses on this song are fun to sing along with, similar to Blues Traveler.  The chorus does leave something to be desired though..<br />5) So Right - This song is one that you hope a cop doesn't pull you over to.. makes you want to get up and dance, just like Rapunzel.  Very catchy, very happy.<br />6) If I Had It All - A song that has playful, wishful lyrics accompanied by a somewhat dark background of troubling sounds.. a cautious tale of someone who is aware of the evils of success.  Definitely worth reading the lyrics.<br />7) What You Are - A hidden gem.. a mid-eastern feel, similar to Minarets and The Last Stop.  The intro is awesome as well.  Just try listening to this song without nodding your head.. an infectious beat.  Dave continually teases the listener by delaying the rhythm with his thoughtful interludes.<br />8) Angel - Another sweet song, in the mold of 'Crash Into Me'.  Only time I've ever heard Dave sing out of tune on an album (When he sings &quot;When you're gone&quot;)<br />9) Fool To Think - What a great song!  The first time I heard it, I thought 'Oh no,electric fiddles..'.. this is one song that I really wish DMB had expanded and played with.. hopefully it will be jammed out live.<br />10) Sleep To Dream Her - Soft, sweet song accompanied by a sweeping saxophone melody.  This song sounds like it could have fit well on 'Crash'.<br />11) Mother Father - An excuse to use Carlos Santana.. not nearly as memorable as 'Love Of My Life' from Santana's Supernatural.<br />12) Everyday - Odd, as it doesn't really fit the rest of the CD.  This song grew out of #36, #41, and Stay.. definitely the closest thing to a classic-sounding DMB song on the album.. playful, happy lyrics similar to those found on Under The Table.
0694003611|1.0|I feel a little silly to be about the only one who doesn't get this book's appeal. It shows the same pictures over and over again, and every other page is black and white. No appeal whatsoever to my daughter, now age 18 months, who has had this book since birth. People say it's the 'lulling&quot; repeatability of the goodnight theme... I say, it's boring. There are so many bright, lively, board books out there today. I do not recommend this one, classic or not.
B000009QO6|5.0|Glenn Danzig here comes into his own, moving from the schlocky (yet undeniably wonderful) Misfits and the experimental goth-metal Samhain to this hand-picked outfit that sounds like the Doors, Sabbath and AC/DC collided in some frigid, reeking hell. I bought this album upon its release in 1988, having at the time just discovered the Misfits. The visions Danzig here presents are so intense, so sharply drawn, and so gleefully evil that it's a part of me forever.<br />Unlike many metal bands that have played Satanism either as a lame joke or as license for anti-Christian violence (see the countless black/death metal bands of N. Europe) Danzig knows that the figure of Lucifer is more slippery, more sophisticated than that; Danzig's Devil is amoral, a sensual, pagan force to be reckoned with. Someone once remarked that if Ian MacKaye was early '80s hardcore punk's super-ego, than Glenn Danzig was its id. Too perfect--and perfectly illustrated here.<br />The opening song is now a Danzig classic, and stands as perhaps his most finely-wrought depiction of the allure, and ambiguity, of evil deeds. &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; refers to the shadow side within us all, a serpent up the spine &quot;that cuts the numbness&quot; and makes us &quot;come alive.&quot;<br />&quot;Yea, took it standing/ Broke commandments/ And he tumbled like a toy/ Blood/ Like a crimson highway/ Spreading out/ From his forehead to the ground.&quot;<br />Glenn's obsession with religious imagery is in full effect here, setting the tone not only for the rest of this album but for all his subsequent works. While some may find it cheesy or overdone, I always found his lyrics and image much more... uh, sophisticated than Slayer or Ozzy or countless other metal bands. He had a lyrical gift rarely found in other contemporary bands, and I think that Jim Morrison influenced more than just his singing.  &quot;Not of this World&quot; revels in bizarre, poetic images that resonate in the unconscious mind: &quot;I am the dawn upon your bloody beach.&quot; Mr. Mojo Risin' would've found this, I think, irresistable.<br />With songs delivered in his overwhelming baritone, so seductive, so damning, Glenn really sounds like Satan trying to entice us to do his bidding. Satan's not gonna sound like Tom Araya; he's gonna sound like Glenn at the beginning of &quot;End of Time&quot; or &quot;Soul on Fire.&quot;<br />&quot;She Rides,&quot; struts and growls; the demoness who &quot;rides the night&quot; and &quot;slides down inside your skin&quot; is a woman he will return to again and again.<br />I could go on and on endlessly on the dark delights of this album; the quiet eeriness of &quot;End of Time&quot; with its howl of desolation, &quot;Lost your soul/Doomed and cold&quot;; the raw, ugly, muscular power of &quot;Am I Demon&quot;; the rebellious fervor of &quot;Mother&quot; or the apocalyptic, mysterious, sexually threatening &quot;Soul on Fire.&quot;<br />The demonic braggadocio here is equally tongue-in-cheek and deadly serious, which I find is why I've always really dug Glenn Danzig's work. But rather than reading my review, you could be listening to this album yourself and letting it insinuate itself into your shadowed heart.m the dawn upon your bloody beach.&quot; Mr. Mojo Risin' would've found this, I think, irresistable.<br />With songs delivered in his overwhelming baritone, so seductive, so damning, Glenn really sounds like Satan trying to entice us to do his bidding.

The haunting music, the hard contrast of the black and white images, the fearful kinetic energy of the hand held footage, the hypnotic power of Olivier's narration, are more lasting, more impressive, more significant, and more entertaining than any recent Hollywood computer graphic pseudo-romantic action extravaganza (that shall be nameless but you all know what movie I mean).<br />As I grew into my teens and I studied military history, the value of the series became more clear and the material more frighteningly real. There is something about black and white film, that creates a cold reality that color films cannot replicate. There is an edge here. Perhaps it is because there is something about the grainy black and white stock that is reminiscent of newspapers. Perhaps it is why Spielberg shot &quot;Private Ryan&quot; in a desaturated style. The series is like an engraving whose print leaves a deep, permanent indentation in your head.<br />This documentary brings home the experience of war. How it begins, how it is fought, how it ends, who wins, and who looses. At the height of the Cold War, when this series was produced, the answer to these questions were quite poignant and not as clear as you might think. It goes beyond the simple, World War Two was the &quot;good war&quot;, track that you see in so many recent productions. It is the defining World War II documentary, unmatched, and unsurpassed.
0380973650|5.0|You have to get this book!!! Seriously!!!!! No.. I mean you HAVE TO read this!  I think my favorite thing about American Gods are the interludes and stories within the stories.  Gaiman uses a whole different style of writing and rhythm to tell these stories.  While you can tell the book and the main story about Shadow is very difinatly American, it is these stories that make the book so wholy trusthful to the culture as it is in America today.  The U.S. is such a combination of cultures and different people from all over the world and that is one thing I think this book represents.  This is such a wonderful book and I think I wouldn't be the same without it!
0380796090|5.0|I loved this story and so did everyone who I have loaned it to.  I laughed through the whole book.  The heroine and her family are all totally lovable characters, and even though she finds herself in an awful situation, she can still laugh and make fun of herself.  A must read....
630562285X|1.0|If it wasn't for the fact that I rented the movie from the library, I would be quite ticked.  Just about every cliché \\"action\\" scenario was used and not very well I might add.  Bland plot, lack of chemistry between Connery and Zeta Jones, choppy story line, etc.  <br />Connery is an attractive man for his age, but come on.  The age difference is just too much to accept.  They should have had Anna Nicole Smith as his love interest, then it would have been believable.  <br />Zeta Jones cannot act to save her life!  And it wasn't one of Connery's better acting moments.<br />I didn't expect much from the movie, but I was still disappointed.  There are just too many horrible things about the movie to state.  <br />If you haven't seen it...don't!
0312243022|3.0|When I first picked up this Pulitzer prize winner, I was impressed by its rotating chapter titles. The stories of three women from three different decades were told in an intertwined fashion. The style is noval, but the complication, as a result, is sometimes beyond my comprehension. Therefore I'm rolling out a 3 stars for this book.
B00003CXXP|3.0|I overall liked this film, at least the first half, although Spielberg seems to lose his way in the second half of the movie, which bears little if any relation to the first part. So although I think it's still worth seeing, there are some problems with it.<br /><br />First, a little background. I read the Newsweek article about this film before I saw it, so I was aware that Kubrick had worked on it for 15 years before handing the whole project over to Spielberg. Given the contrasts and differences between the two directors, I was interested to see what the final film would be like. And the film ends up being an uneasy mix of the two director's visions.<br /><br />First, the good news. You'll probably be entertained, if nothing else, by this film. The special effects are worth seeing. The two main leads, Osment and Law, do an excellent job in their respective roles. The story line has its touching moments, but takes some weird twists and turns, especially at the end, although if you're a Kubrick fan, or a sci-fi fan, you may find the last part the most entertaining.<br /><br />Osment does a fine job with the little boy's part. The robo-stud Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, is a nice touch, and Law also does a fine job with this part too. The role had some good development to it (unlike some of the other characters) but could have used even more. Still, his part was a nice touch, and Law is completely convincing in the role.<br /><br />William Hurt's dialog seems a little forced in his main speech where he's explaining what's happened to Osment after Osment has found his way back, but it's okay. Hurt is always good even if the movie he's in is an overall dog.<br /><br />And now the bad news. The first one-third of the film works well, as we're introduced to the family and the artificial boy, played by Osment, who makes his appearance and becomes part of the family. After that the film takes a distinctly dark turn when the family's biological son wakes up from his coma, as his relationship to Osment becomes more and more disturbed. Eventually the mother abandons Osment rather than return him to the company to have him destroyed, and the rest of the movie is about Osment's trying to find his way back.<br /><br />However, the film really loses itself at this point, in the middle third. The \\"Flesh Fair\\" carnival scene, where humans destroy the cast-away robots, or mecha's, as they're called, on-stage, wouldn't even work well in a B sci-fi movie, and it works even less well here, in what would have been an otherwise acceptable, although not great, movie.<br /><br />However to mention the only good thing about the scene, the crowd gets pissed off at the ringmaster who is about to destroy Osment (because Osment is so life-like that they don't believe he's a mecha) and starts pelting him with garbage. At that point the crowd of onlookers riots and allows Osment and Law to escape.<br /><br />The last third of the movie is in some ways the most interesting, but is also the weirdest, as there's not much to connect it to the rest of the movie, as Osment becomes frozen in the sea ice in his copter after escaping the Flesh Fair and is discovered 2000 years later, barely functioning, but basically still \\"alive.\\"<br /><br />His rescuers are an advanced race of robots who have outlived humanity (not too surprising, considering the current state of humanity and the world), which is long dead. Like archaeologists, they are trying to reconstuct man and his civilization, and Osment is the greatest discovery they've made yet about mankind, since his memories are still intact, and he is the only person they've ever seen, artificial or not, that ever knew a real human being. They also look like the gracile aliens we've come to recognize, only these look even more like Giacometti statues they're so slender and thin.<br /><br />Anyway, the last third is pretty far out stuff, and although interesting, as I said, it's really almost a separate movie, although I nice mood piece, perhaps a high tech mood piece, if you will. But it seems pretty clear that by this point Spielberg had pretty much lost his way by this point as far as trying to bring the story to an even remotely meaningful or sensible ending.<br /><br />That having been said, I still enjoyed it, and if you watch it not expecting too much and simply wishing to be reasonably entertained for your oney, it's not a bad way to spend a Sat. or Sun. afternoon.eparate movie, although I nice mood piece, perhaps a high tech mood piece, if you will.

B00005BJ9W|4.0|Thank God this album has finally been re-mastered and re-released.  As a longtime Duran Duran fan, this was the first album of theirs that I ever purchased... you remember vinyl, right?  I have the older Rio cd, but this one sounds so much like I remember (I was particularly happy to hear the restored &quot;longer&quot; version of 'Save a Prayer', which the first cd totally cut to pieces).  I do miss the original vinyl version of 'Hold Back the Rain' though.  The enhanced cd elements are nice, and contain lyrics, 3 videos (Save a Prayer, Hungry like the Wolf, and Rio), old photos, and a discography of all the releases off the Rio album.  Overall, I think it far exceeds the original cd pressing, and while the enhanced cd stuff is cool, it's not anything really new and exciting. It's such a joy to hear the songs so clear and crisp, with all the little nuances, and relive the experience of so long ago, in 1982, when I would listen to my Rio record... if you're a fan, there's no choice-- you must get this!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I rented this movie because I had heard very little about it and was curious about a George Clooney movie that wasn't all over the media.  My daughter (22yrs old) and I (42) were at first perplexed..was it a musical or what?  By 10 minutes into it we were both addicted; the music working with the scenes was very well done. We were both new to this type of music.  I wouldn't have cared about the story or the 3 stooges likenesses, but they were catchy too. I now own the DVD and the soundtrack. Truely different and fun.......
0425180638|1.0|I have read all of Cornwell's books, even the strange Judy Hammer ones, and this is the one that is going to make me give them up. If I had picked this one up first I would never have read another one. Kay Scarpetta is so drenched in paranoia, Marino so nasty, and Scarpetta's psychologist friend so completely venal and treacherous that I found myself hoping some character would come along and just finish them all off.  The reader is set up to expect that the &quot;Last Precinct,&quot; a private firm started by the suddenly and miraculously wealthy Lucy, would play a big role, but other than providing Lucy with an excuse to get a helicopter, it has nothing to do with the plot. Instead, the plot seems to be that all of the antagonists in all of the Scarpetta novels turn out to have been in league with each other to set Scarpetta up. In the next novel it will no doubt turn out that they secretly implanted an electronic monitoring device in her brain, and she has to wear a foil hat to keep it from transmitting. Cornwell's earlier novels, though grim, were at least well plotted and entertaining. This one is just all over the place. How did it get past her editor? I wish Cornwell would take a long vacation and a few tranquilizers before she writes another word, and that the publisher would hire editors who know what they're doing.
B00005B36H|5.0|Although it has been said that this CD is nothing more than mindless drivel, I disagree. I frankly enjoy the hypnotic quality of these songs, as opposed to the idiotic noise others can make. The quasi-mystical overtones the album has certainly does not detract from the overall experience. Despite their previous work, this stands apart as an excellent production from Tool. Three cheers!
B00000JZC4|1.0|seems as if filter wrote this while half awake and on a hangover. this is, by far, the worst album in my cd collection. i bought this cd in hopes of a good, solid, hard rock album, but what i found was a very un melodic thoughtless album composed of whining and cursing. i don't under stand how a band like filter could put out such an &quot;album&quot; and get away with it. i'm severely disappointed.
0761957553|5.0|The author uses a different approach to explain statistics and spss.  If you have already read some conventional statistics books and are still confused about what all the numbers really mean (or even you think you understand them very well), you should buy and read this book.  Also, the materials about spss are perfectly integrated into the process of teaching statistics. Highly recommend.
B00004WC6J|3.0|... but not the ideal introduction to D. Sylvian's work. It is flabbergasting to see just how varied the man's work is, and what wonderful collaborations are featured here (Fripp and Sakamoto, to name but two). However, you cannot have a 'best of' (which this is not) that has the style and consistency of his other albums. Want a good introduction to the man's work? Buy subsequently Alchemy, Brilliant Trees and The First Day. Bet you'll buy all the other ones soon?
0393316041|3.0|Okay, I admired and respected Richard Feynman alot and this book was a good read.  But I agree with some of the other reviewers that he might have come across as being arrogant and that some of the anecdotes were gleefully condescending.  I had the unconfortable feeling that I might have been one of the hopeless luddites he was lampooning! If you can get past this feeling, however, you will enjoy the book.  It does reveal how a truly great mind works, warts and all.
0553573403|5.0|I am not an avid reader of fantasy. However, this series of books has been recommended to me so many times that I finally had to give it a try. Minus the appendix, this paperback is about 806 pages long. I was absolutely riveted throughout every single page! I devoured this story and quickly ordered A CLASH OF KINGS in order to find out what happens to all of these fascinating characters.<br /><br /> Martin has created a storyline that is bold, heart-wrenching and breathtaking. His words weave vivid mind pictures, and reading this book is almost like watching a movie---I felt that I could actually see the scenes taking place throughout the novel. Eddard, Arya, Jon, Daenerys, Viserys, Khal Drogo, Bran, Old Nan, Sansa, Tyrion, Catelyn, Jaime, Cersei---and I could go on! All these characters are fascinating. The story focuses on political deceit, murder, quests for power, magical spells, ancient warnings, intrigue. There are sword fights, plunderings, all-knowing wolves, and cold, dead things that walk in the night. I can't wait to sink my teeth into the next installment of this series. How will Jon fare on the Wall? What happens to Arya? Will Sansa be wed to Prince Joffrey or will she find the strength to fight against his black heart? What will happen to Robb? I need to know!<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this novel. If Martin can maintain this type of storytelling, then he has one more loyal fan to add to his list. This is definitely a must for fantasy fans. Actually...this is a great novel for anyone who loves to read a good story.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This is the best movie i have seen in a long time.  Hot woman, Hot cars and Hot Action == :-).  If you crave excitement, woman, and cars you can get it all in this dvd.  Not only do you get this kick butt movie you get bonuses that give you insite on how this movie was made showing the stunts they practise and etc.  Also the Cult's Music video is on here.  But don't take my word of advice watch and if you aint happy sue me.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of the biggest draws to this wonderful movie is the way the Coen brothers where able to give a unique sense of style and location to this period piece.  From the wonderful cinematography to the highly acclaimed soundtrack, the viewer gets a a stylized version of the southern U.S. of the 1930s.  The storyline, roughly based on the Oddysey, goes throughout the land in a somewhat haphazard, but madcap way.  It's not the end result of the plot that matters, though, it's the journey.  As with other Coen brothers films, the dialogue and regional dialect is a big draw, with the great cast delivering tons of quirky, hilarious sayings.  One note, however, with many Coen movies, I've noticed people seem to love them or hate them.  O Brother might not be everyone's cup of tea, though after many a repeated veiwing, I find it wonderful.  Aside from the film, getting the soundtrack would be quite worthwhile as well.<br />The DVD has a few nice bonuses, the best of which are a couple of interesting featurettes, and the 'Man of Constant Sorrow' music video.
B0000524E5|4.0|I read some of the other reviews and just words of advice &quot;DONT LISTEN TO THEM&quot;.  I am a guy who like hardcore action and adventure movies.  I bought this just mainly so i can see the girls dancing on the bar but i got seriously hooked into it.  The songs are nice, the dancing is awesome, little bit of humor in it, and all around good movie.  I bought it 3 days ago and have watched it 4 times.  This movie is a born classic.
B000002OXU|5.0|I still think &quot;Who's Next&quot; deserves its status as one of the greatest albums in rock history. Every song here is a bona-fide classic.  Unfortunately, I just can't listen to this album  nowadays without thinking of new-car &quot;Bargain&quot;s and yuppie morons playing polo in their SUVs to the strains of &quot;Baba O'Riley.&quot;  The licensing of classic songs for use in commercials is a very annoying practice which really ticks me off.  Don't  get me wrong--I'm not getting on The Who's case or calling them sellouts, but SOMEBODY (maybe at Universal or The Who's publishing company) is quick to lend their songs out.  I don't mean to stand on a soapbox, but I hate to hear their greatest work commercialized like this.
0060925000|5.0|This was a very good book, but you must have patiance and a good memory to read it.
B000002R48|5.0|This is my favorite Dream Theater CD. Just ahead of Images &amp; Words.  I actually think the vocals are quite good on this album, and Petrucci is at his best. Favorite tracks are   Ytse Jam, Killing Hand, Afterlife, and Light the Fuse &amp; Get Away.   BUY this CD. You will not regret it. Every song is worthwhile.
0684803356|2.0|F. Scott Fitzgerald himself said of this novel: &quot;It has all the profundity of REBECCA.&quot; REBECCA being a sleight novel. This book reads like a 2nd-rate journalist's attempt at writing a novel. It lacks the subtlety of Hemingway's other novels. I love Hemingway. But I didn't love this book.
B00003CXN4|5.0|This is a great epic.  It deals with a very prevalent and interesting topic.. the war on drugs.  The stories are all done and intertwined extremely well. This is 2000's best and the   best since American Beauty...
0451191153|2.0|Ayn Rand was, at one point, a novelist; I'm convinced that she was half decent at it, too.  However, at some point in her life, Rand decided that she was the most important philosopher in history.  This came after her first novel, We the Living.  Now, I would say that you should read Rand because she's a half-decent novelist, and in addition her philosophy is a fascinating view into the Narcissistic Personality Disorder she suffered from (Howard Roark, in this book, is a Narcissist and a sociopath to boot).<br />Fountainhead is interesting in that it does try to work in architectural ideas, and when Rand's not busy slamming you with her aesthetic tastes (or her philosophy) it does have a point about originality, and how a work should really be composed as a whole.  Now, Rand never finished her thought, and Roark really just seems to do it through sheer instinct, but it's a good thought nonetheless.<br />The characters of the Fountainhead are what set it above Atlas Shrugged.  Howard Roark and Dominique Francon are party line Objectivists, whose ideas flow from the mouth of Rand.  However, there's more of a spread in the rest:  Peter Keating is really just a man with no self-worth (Rand's Narcissism stopped her from seeing a middle between no self-worth and selfishness), Gail Wynand is a failed idealist (more interesting than Roark), and Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is a standard Objectivist villain (he would get the award for worst name in English literature if not for Balph Eubank in Atlas Shrugged; yes, BALPH).  Since the non-Roark/Toohey characters don't just spout Randisms (Roark is Objectivist; Toohey is the evil Anti-Objectivist that Rand set up as a strawman to knock down), they get to have some philosophical doubts and worries, and are just more interesting than the Producers and Looters of Atlas Shrugged.<br />Don't get suckered in by Rand's philosophy.  It's not that good, especially when you consider that it doesn't reflect upon reality.  Egoism is a false and evil ethics.  Don't believe me?  Okay...one, Rand's defense is based in the false assumption that rational people have no conflict of interest.  This is obviously not true--if you and I are each trying to sell a car to a potential buyer, who will not buy more than one car, isn't it in both of our interests to sell him the car?  So don't our interests conflict, even if we're rational people?  Two, one is incapable of ensuring the survival of the human race.  Ever notice that Rand isn't concerned with kids, of which she had none?  Well, under an egoist ethics, there's no reason to have them.  Indeed, it may be considered &quot;irrational&quot; to desire children in the first place, and hence evil.  Three, selfishness is considered bad because it is too much concern for the self with no regard to others.  There is nothing wrong with caring for one's own needs, but this does not have to be at the expense of caring about other human beings as well.  It's one of the things that makes a society possible.<br />Rand, because of her psychological disorders, saw only hard dichotomies and was a master of the false dilemma.  Self-sacrifice is not the giving up of a greater value for a lesser one, it is the giving up of a lesser value for a greater one.  Unlike in Rand-world, other people and society DO matter.  Her altruism is a false strawman made so that her evil egoism could seem rational by comparison.  I suggest the Christian ethic:  LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.  Think about the two things that this implies:  one, love your neighbor; two, love yourself.  The command is not one or the other.  It is both.  This is the error Rand makes in her ethics, and which is perpetuated by her followers (I was in an introductory philosophy course taught by Allan Gotthelf, who wrote a book called On Ayn Rand, and he specifically used these false dichotomies to argue in favor of Rand's position on almost all accounts).<br />Ultimately false is Rand's account of love.  There is no suchthing as real conditional love.  That is a projection of certain values one has upon another person, and the idealization of those values, never of the actual person &quot;loved.&quot;  Real love is unconditional, stemming from emotional bonds that Rand herself was incapable of growing.  That's why Rand's romance seems depressingly...unromantic.  (The way it happens in the Fountainhead is called rape.)<br />As I said at the beginning, I'm convinced that Ayn Rand was a half-decent novelist.  I'm giving this book 2 stars because its philosophy, not its story or characters, is bad.  If this seems contradictory to my prior post, it's because I've reconsidered Rand as an author since.  I think a bit better of her, but without accepting her philosophy.  If you read this book, be sure to ask yourself not only: does this follow logically? but also: does this reflect on the world I live in, or simply on a fantasy world created by the author?  I think that the answer, frankly, is the latter.
0446310786|5.0|What can be said about a book that covers so many bases?  To Kill a Mockingbird is the tale of two children, Jem and Scout growing up in a rural Georgia town.  Their father, Atticus Finch, is a kind, just socially responsible man who takes on a case in which a black man is accused of raping a poor white girl.  Since the book is set in the south in the 1930's, the defending of a black man against a white woman is unheard of, but Atticus takes the case pro bono because of every man's unalienable rights, and because of the fact that his defendant is not guilty, a fact which is hushed up and covered over by bigotry and hate in this small southern town.  The novel makes a stand on basic human rights while covering so much other territory.  The antics of Jem and Scout perfectly capture what it is like to be a child during the summer, despite the fact that these summers take place in the charged atmosphere of a racist southern town where both Jem and Scout are forced to do some growing up.  The mysterious character of Boo Radley points out once again that a person's appearance and reputation mean nothing when it comes to their character.  There is so much packed into this one little novel that it the one-hundredth reading would still be a fresh as the first.  Every scene, from Scout's first day at school to the night outside the city jail where a lynch mob threatens Atticus and his client are drawn with amazing skill and beauty.  This book is an American treasure and Atticus Finch is one of the greatest characters ever to appear in literature.  The only real question this book leaves you with is why didn't Harper Lee ever take up his pen to create another novel?
0380973650|4.0|I read this book starting at 3am, during one of the rare heat spells that we get here in Buffalo. The house was quiet, except for the whirring of the large fan in the room, keeping me cool while I became enveloped in this book, armed with my trusty cold bottle of Mountain Dew.<br />I had been a fan of Mr. Gaiman's for a long time, from the concepts introduced in &quot;Black Orchid&quot; and &quot;The Sandman&quot;, to the novels like &quot;Good Omens&quot;, &quot;Neverwhere&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot;. (which is good in it's novel or graphic novel appearance.)<br />&quot;American Gods&quot; is a wonder in imaginative uses of modern mythology. You may have to look up a few referances to catch a few lost traits behind many of the ancient characters as the reside in present day America, but why shouldn't you? You are intrested in them already, aren't you?<br />The battle between the old gods and the new is innovative, fresh, yet still familiar on a subconsious level. Like a dream you forgot for a few days until an image triggers it up. The idea of an internet god and a television god hits close to home in our society, maybe it strikes a little fear there, too. It is a concept we see happening while dreading it at the same time: the worship of modern trappings.  &quot;American Gods&quot; also has us ponder the old gods and our concept of faith and belief.<br />Laura is the division between life and death, another dream/fear realized. Someone lost to death comes back to you, but are you better for it? Are they? Think if this as a gentler version of a chance at the Monkey's Paw. What would you wish for if you thought you had no one? Would you believe if old gods came to you with their stories, or does media worship have more of your faith these days?<br />This, like most of Gaiman's works, is one of those novels that are great for the night dwellers like myself, who read best in the quietest hours, maybe crickets cricking in the background.<br />There are some paragraphs that are shorter than they need to be, and the pace of the plot is mostly breakneck speed, but the nice thing about &quot;American Gods&quot; is that you can go back, re-read, and fill in the blanks.

0684803356|5.0|There is no way to cover in 1000 words everything that this book has to offer.  Centering around one man who must undertake one mission with the help of some guerillas in the Spanish Civil War, this book is in fact the deepest most complete work on war that has ever been written.  Although, as I mentioned, the whole book is only about Robert Jordan blowing up a single bridge, the book widens in scope as it goes on allowing us to see the war from more and more angles, through more and more people, on both sides of the fight and of all rank and position.  It drives homet the point that the title of the book suggests.  Ask not for whom the bell tolls, the bell tolls for thee.  This refers to the church bells that would be rung to announce a death and is part of a larger quote which begins familiarly enough, \\"No man is an island.\\"  Simply put, there is no such thing as isolationism, there is no way to not consider yourself a part of the human race.  When you hear of someone!'s death, there is no need to wonder whose death it is, for whomever it was, they were a part of you, and so their death is in a way your death.  Their jouney was your journey.  Thus this book does not allow us to leave any vantage point of this war and this battle unturned, and every character relates and reacts to every other character, every action has a reaction, for no man is an island, as this beautifully crafted book points out time and again.

0380002930|5.0|So what if it's about bunnies? This is one of the most amazing stories ever to be put down on paper. After one of their friends has conniption and becomes convinced that their burrow is about to be destroyed, a band of bunnies leaves their home in search of some place to found a new colony of rabbits. The first two-thirds of this book is about their journey, the last third involves a battle undertaken against a headstrong rival warren that won't allow them to exist in their new home. The characters are brilliant, funny, and if you don't find yourself routing for them by the end I will be quite surprised. The world that Adams creates is complete in every way, including rabbit folklore, vocabulary, and even rabbit jokes. The adventure this book takes you on is not to be challenged and every climax seems like the end until the next one begins building to explode your brain even more. I dare any reader to finish this book and not swell with pride while thinking of Bigwig or Hazel or Blackthorn or any of these rabbits and the struggle they endure and persevere through to find a place that they can call home.

A gorgeous sight that comes along once in a blue moon and is not to be missed. And when it does come it holds an impact that with last forever. A beautiful story about a boy who tries to break away from something so right, but later very wrong. This novel reminds me of a poem by Pink Floyd:<br />Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air  And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves  The echo of a distant tide  Comes willowing across the sand  And everything is green and submarine  And no one showed us to the land  And no one knows the wheres or whys  But something stirs and  Something tries  And starts to climb towards the light  Strangers passing in the street  By chance two separate glances meet  And I am you and what I see is me  And do I take you by the hand  And lead you through the land  And help me understand the best I can  And no one calls us to the land  And no one crosses there alive  And no one speaks  And no one tries  And no one flies around the sun  And now this is the day you fall  Upon my waking eyes  Inviting and inciting me to rise  And through the window in the wall  Comes streamin in on sunlight wings  A million bright ambassadors of morning  And no one sings me lullabies  And no one makes me close my eyes  So I throw the windows wide  And call to you across the sky.
B00005J9U1|5.0|I love Bob and I own &quot;Legend&quot;, which arguably could be considered a Greatest Hits CD as well. Therefore, I was sort of surprised when this album came out because there is so much overlap between songs. Nevertheless I bought this album and I have to say the additional songs on this album and not on &quot;Legend&quot; (Turn Your Lights Down Low, So Much Trouble in the World, Iron Lion Zion) compliment this classic Bob Marley album and make this well worth the purchase even though I own &quot;Legend&quot;.<br />If you do not already own &quot;Legend&quot;, hands down this has to be a better choice if you are looking for a single CD as your Bob Marley collection. If you are a bigger fan, be sure to check out his 4-cd box set &quot;Songs of Freedom&quot;.
B000002U82|2.0|If you come to this album, as I did, having heard nothing from Pink Floyd but -The Wall-, you may be disappointed. If parts of this recording sound like the Alan Parsons Project, or even -Abbey Road-, it's probably because Alan Parsons was an engineer on both albums. In any case, any of those is superior to this (yawn) pretentious and overrated album. Listen for that voice at the very end: a very -Abbey Road- like gimmick.

0064400557|5.0|E.B. White has written a wonderful children's book that is very entertaining and equally educational.  The length and level of comprehension needed makes it appropriate for ages seven to nine.  There are several life lessons the reader can learn throughout the story, which also reflect lessons that the Bible teaches, such as humility and servanthood.  While children are being greatly amuzed at this humorous storyline, they are also learning valuable lessons about life, which is why it is unforgettable.      The use of personification of the barn animals is the most effective source of humor:  the goose cheers for &quot;Wilbur&quot;, who is the pig trying to escape from the barn; the sheep talk as if the farmers are &quot;plotting a murder&quot; to kill &quot;Wilbur&quot;; &quot;Wilbur&quot; does a back twist in the air; and &quot;Charlotte&quot;, who is the talking spider, states that, &quot;People are not as smart as bugs!&quot;  It is hillarious!  The barn animals are also experiencing human emotions, which help children to relate to them, such as loneliness, anger, satisfaction, joy, and love.  It is a roller coaster storyline that keeps children very attentive!       Also, equally impressing are the life lessons that White implements throughout the animals' lives.  &quot;Wilbur&quot; realizes that what is truly important in life is not that he is the most popular, talented, or best looking, it is the satisfaction of having one true friend to share his life with, who is &quot;Charlotte&quot;.  &quot;Wilbur&quot; and &quot;Charlotte's&quot; humility and servanthood create a wonderful friendship.  This definitely will teach children to be humble and to treat others as they would want to be treated, while not being too proud or self-seeking like &quot;Templeton&quot;, who is the selfish rat.  This is also taught in the Bible, when Jesus states, &quot;For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted&quot; (Luke 14:11).  Through &quot;Wilbur&quot; not viewing himself as &quot;terrific&quot;, but still becoming famous and &quot;Charlotte&quot; saving &quot;Wilbur's&quot; life without due recognition, children will learn that being humble and serving others is not always the way the world desires us to act, but it is the most rewarding way to live.  White is also very informative about spiders:  the seven sections of their legs and how they spin a web, which is very educational.  It is very interesting when &quot;Dr. Dorian&quot; states that just a spider's web, even without words inscribed in it, is a miracle.  God created every animal and insect, which are true miracles, and it is great that E.B. White points that out.  I found no weaknesses throughout this story.      This is a book I highly recommend for young children.  Through the use of much humor and implementation of valuable character traits that reflect who God wants His children to be, this story is one that children will treasure forever.
630027120X|5.0|This is a magnificent film!  This film has helped me to form a more clear picture of Catholicism.  Being a protestant, I have for some time had a very negative view of Catholicism, but Father Gabriel played by Jeremy Irons has won my heart.  To be like this man is something worth aspiring to.  I see him and Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert Deniro)as holy men trying to live and love for God in the midst of a horribly corrupt system.  The tension is really felt in this film.  The conflict is passionate.  The film was made with taste as well.  While most of the violent films put out by hollywood are killing people with much blood and gore, but little or no pain to the viewer, this film was made in such a way that when someone dies there is less blood shown, but it hurts, I mean it hurts the viewer(unless you are completely desensitized).  The cinematography is glorious.  As Rodrigo completes his penance the picture of redemption brought me to tears.  The humanity of almost all the characters comes through if you pay attention.  Even the characters who might fit into the &quot;bad guy&quot; categories.  The only negative thing I can say is that there were a few lines in the film which I found empty and contradictory to the message of the film.  One of these happens to be the last line of the film as the Catholic emmissary closes his letter to his superior.  The dissapointing thing was that this line starts out with incredible power and then he waters it down.  Overall however I think that this movie is incredibly powerful and has changed my worldview.
0345350499|4.0|I first read this at fourteen, sunk in fascination for King Arthur and Guinevere. It was with a great deal of confusion later that I discovered that, for a lot of people, this book had been a seminal moment in their lives, because, sadly, I barely remembered it.<br />I recovered it (ahem) years later, to reread in preparation for the upcoming TNT miniseries, and discovered that the world from older eyes was much richer... even though there were basic flaws in the storytelling. The first half of the book is slow but enthralling, the fabric is full of threads of gold and silver and you walk slowly through it to enjoy the surroundings. But after a certain point, particularly when our main touchstone, Morgaine, is no longer in the center of Arthurian politics, the book begins an endless drag to the final end.<br />But the storytelling is so fascinating and the characters so complex (with the exception of Bishop Patricius, of course; one of my main complaints) that you immerse yourself in the book more than read than it. Bradley managed to not only deal well with the cast of thousands Arthurian legend supplies us with, she even formed multiples of some stock figures because she needed more (Viviane, Niniane and Nimue are all forms of the same name, for instance). And why hadn't any other writer made the connection between The Lady of the Lake and Lancelot du Lac?
0784011796|4.0|This film uses interesting mathematics and other theories to create an exciting atmosphere. You can almost watch it as an extended music video. The music and visuals are excellent, better than most blockbusters. <br />A lot of the stuff is based on the real-life Chudnovsky brothers, who you are pretty interesting in their own right.
0345363132|5.0|Is it fair to review a book that changed your life?  No, literally.  At fourteen I stayed up until four in the morning, devouring this story of medieval power and politics, and have been a medieval historian ever since.<br />Penman has done a fantastic job of turning dry historical fact into fascinating and believable historical fiction.  People's motives are not simple and easily understandable in real life, and the sometimes-conflicting drives and needs and desires of the cast of thousands in this book live up to that fact.<br />While undeniable sympathetic to King Richard the Third, it is not a cloying, simplistic, Good King Richard whitewash.  Instead, it portrays the much-maligned king as an adoring younger brother left adrift when his idol dies and proves to have been less than perfect.<br />Supporting characters are equally complex, from the self-destructive King Edward to the self-absorbed Kingmaker, Warwick, from the unlikely queen Elizabeth Woodville to the helpless pawn, Elizabeth of York, from the insane King Henry VI to the ambitious King Henry VII.  Possibly the only black villain in the piece is the Duke of Buckingham; everyone else is painted in shades of grey that make them honest people, rather than props.<br />If you can't stand historical novels because they are boring, read this. ...It's better than the tabloids!

0671027573|5.0|Wonderful -- I couldn't put it down.  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much.  The interaction between Jaine and Sam is refreshingly, hilariously funny.  Ms. Howard's character descriptions were so concise I could picture each of them perfectly and felt as if I knew them personally.  The suspense was well balanced throughout the book.  Linda Howard just keeps getting better and better.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I liked Exciter on first listen, but after subsequent listenings, I've grown to love it. It's got all the signature Mode-isms - layered synthesizers, quirky guitar licks, hyper dance beats and Martin Gore ballads - but with a much more confident, laid-back feel. Dream On, the first single, is a perfect example of the brilliantly-crafted, art-pop tracks on the rest of the CD. Uptempo numbers include I Feel Loved - kind of Strangelove meets World in My Eyes but with a superpositive message. There's also Dead of Night - a Marilyn Manson-esque rocker that's reminiscent of Barrel of a Gun and I Feel You, but harder. The ballads are Exciter's real strengths, though. In Freelove, Dave Gahan urges his reluctant girlfriend to stop the headgames and realize there's &quot;no hidden catch, no strings attached.&quot; The minimalist synthesizers compliment beautiful acoustic guitar notes. Similarly, Goodnight Lovers and When the Body Speaks are as easy on the mind as on the ears. I never thought DM would come close to approximating Violator but they're almost there with Exciter. The more you listen to it, the more you'll like it.
1558908846|4.0|I have seen this movie, and I have to admit, the elements of extended plot and complexity cannot be associated with this movie.  So what?  Not every movie is only for the viewing of the critic hierarchy and the Albert Einsteins of the population.  This is an action flick made for EVERYONE's enjoyment, and while lacking in deep or meaningful substance, it still is entertainment for thousands.  I am a fairly intelligent person who likes to watch and read very complex material, but every once and a while, I like to kick back, relax, pop some popcorn, grab a soda, and let my brain rest for a while.  And why not dazzle me with a few explosions at the same time?  IT'S JUST A MOVIE, folks, so chill out with the bad reviews.  This is obviously no Schindler's List or Terms of Endearment, but it is a nice piece of entertainment, no strings attached.
0393314804|4.0|Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh, is one of the few instances in literature where the movie is actually and truthfully a lot better than the book. While the movie by Danny Boyle is a condensed version of the book with some things changed, it's a lot better than the book by not trying to cram in a whole bunch of things.<br />Another thing (and this is mainly just a squabble from a boy raised on the English language) is that there is too much usage of Scottish slang and after a while it gets hard to follow the story AND be able to decipher the sometimes confusing dialect from the Scotts, in particular the narrator Renton.<br />However, I can highly reccomend this book to those looking for an experimental story structure- this book is told entirely in the first person but not all from Renton, which is intriguing that Welsh decides to give the other characters a voice alongside.  Even if it's not intelligible all the way, it never slants in its fascination.
0593044703|4.0|Afficionados of this series have already figured out that the quick way to get ahold of the new one is to go over to Amazon.co.uk and pre-order them there.  The third book in the series, &quot;Memories of Ice&quot;, is now available for pre-order, and due to be published in Oct. 2001.  Good news for fans of book #1 who (like me) were frustrated by #2 (Deadhouse Gates) only following the storyline of some of the characters -- #3 sounds like it will take us back to the main Bridgeburner brigade.  No wonder Erikson is going to take 10 books to deal with this series, if he plans on spawning multiple storylines and devoting a book to each thread!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Next to Die Hard and Brazil this is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it 3 times in the theaters. It is so original and so filled with great ideas and plot twists, ...I have never rubbed my head or been absorbed in deep thought so many times within a single movie. Advice: Don't see this movie while out of school, your brain will hurt from thinking so much.
B00003CX5P|2.0|This movie deserves the Bronx Cheer.  It is the Star Wars version of Star Trek, The Movie (The first one).  Midichloridians are the source of the Force!?!  Puh-lease!  THe only good part was the duel between Qui-gon, Obi-wan and Darth Maul.  The rest was just too much.  The only reason why it got two stars is that the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made (yes, Virginia, even worse than Plan 9 from Outer Space) Dune gets that dubious honor.
0736621458|5.0|Ernest Hemingway was one of the most popular, influential, and charismatic of the American 20th century novelists. Books On Tape has undertaken to publishing an unabridged audiobook edition of Hemingway's body of work. Ably narrated by Alexander Adams, For Whom The Bell Tolls is Hemingway's classic story of Robert Jordan, an American fighting with anti-fascist guerillas in the mountains of Spain. This riveting novel of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, inspired idealism and battlefield disenchantment is a timeless testament....

B000002OX7|5.0|Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwhistle and Keith Moon set out in 1970/1971 to make Pete's new rock opera Lighthouse (or a title like that).  It fell through, but what songs were salvaged were included on this masterpiece.  An excellent piece of rock, with songs that can pass on through the generations (even anthems that can be attributed to the birth of punk) and can be very catchy at times.  While Quadrophenia is slightly better, this is definately the best album of 1971 and will always be remembered for such hits as &quot;Baba O'Reiley&quot;, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes (my favorite on the album with it being the unofficial start of the rock ballad) and the rebellious &quot;Won't get Fooled Again&quot;
031286504X|5.0|Drag your soul through the mud.  One of the most compeling and disturbing books I've ever read.  Not for the suicidal or depressed.  Matheson creates a castaway without hope of rescue, a protaganist whose suicide would seem a victory.  This is not your father's horror novel.
078322608X|5.0|I rented this movie, expecting it to be an ordinary sci-fi movie. It is anything but that. It is so original, and so confusing it makes it a masterpiece. The vision is a dark one indeed, but it needed that to make it all fit. I am a Gilliam fan, and this is almost on-par with one of the best science fiction movies ever, Brazil.
B000002J1U|5.0|In 1969, Led Zeppelin hit it big with their first two groundbreaking albums, which both remain landmarks in the history of rock music and laid the foundation for all hard rock and heavy metal to follow.  But with the release of LED ZEPPELIN III on October 5, 1970, it showed that the band had more than just blues-inflected rock in their musical veins.  In my opinion, this is the definitive Led Zeppelin album; it's certainly their most creative, thoughtful, and introspective LP.<br />The record's opening track is the fast-paced 2-minute rocker &quot;Immigrant Song,&quot; which picks up where ZEP II left off.  The song is quickly followed by the energetic acoustic number &quot;Friends&quot; which features great use of the tabla drums, and &quot;Celebration Day&quot; has a finger-pickin' guitar riff so infectious that you can actually groove to it.  &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is Zeppelin's true masterpiece, even surpassing the almighty &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;  A 7-minute blues epic about love lost, the singing and instrumentation are at an all-time high: John Bonham's drumming is as powerful and subtle as ever; John Paul Jones contributes to the dark feel of the song with an excellent back-alley organ riff; Jimmy Page's heartbreaking guitar solo in the middle is magnificent; and Robert Plant quite possibly delivers the best vocal performance of his career.<br />Bonham delivers some damn fine lyrics on the catchy rocker &quot;Out on the Tiles,&quot; in which Jones's bass sounds like a thumping trampoline.  &quot;Gallows Pole,&quot; a remake of a Leadbelly song, begins with a soft acoustic groove but like many Zeppelin songs, it builds and builds towards a rousing cresendo.  &quot;Tangerine&quot; and &quot;That's The Way&quot; are, simply put, two of the best songs in the Zeppelin canon.  Great acoustics and heartfelt lyrics contribute to this back-to-back emotional punch.  The album closes with the folky &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; and the bizarre &quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper.&quot;<br />With this album, you get a little of everything: a little hard rock (&quot;Immigrant Song,&quot; &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot;), a little bluegrass (&quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot;), a little blues (&quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;), and lots of awesome folk tunes (&quot;Gallows Pole&quot; and so on). III is Led Zeppelin's best album for many reasons, but it doesn't get the respect it deserves.  The playing, the singing, the songwriting, the acoustics, the remastering--everything is perfect.  Sure, Zeppelin has made many great albums, but III shows their ambition and musical diversity.  A masterwork.
B00005B4GU|5.0|When I first heard this album, I did not like it at all. I think I listened to it once or twice through and had a very annoyed feeling after listening to it, while other Radiohead fans I knew were raving about how great it was. It seemed to me like a collection of songs which were a lot of random noise, making up a highly non-cohesive album. However, as I began to really concentrate on the album and really ponder what I was listening to, I started loving this album. Like Kid A, OK Computer, and to a very limited extent The Bends, this album requires your total concentration and attention in order to truly appreciate and love. You won't appreciate Amnesiac if you have it on as background music for cleaning your house or doing the laundry. The way to truly appreciate Amnesiac is to sit down with an hour or two (in case you want to listen to it twice!) to spare, some good quality headphones\speakers, sit in a chair with no distractions, close your eyes, and just let the music soak into you and permeate your entire being. I think this is a better album than Kid A, because it has a nice mix of singable, traditional, memorable songs you can sing in the shower (You and Whose Army, Pyramid Song, I Might Be Wrong) and Kid A-esque songs (Pulk\Pull Revolving Doors, Like Spinning Plates, Packd Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box). Although some tracks on this album aren't as great and impressive as others, every track on this album really contributes something new and different to the Radiohead catalog and their body of music. I can't wait to hear how these songs come across live.
B00005M91K|2.0|Being a BIG fan of Ron Fricke, I can't honestly give this 5 stars. Why? Well, 2 reasons. For one, by his own standards, Fricke has done a lot more in nearly every one of his other projects (with the only exception perhaps being the shorts series). What do I mean by more? Experimentation. Stepping a little further into the unknown, doing the undone. The other reason I can't give it 5 stars is because, despite the fact that by other standards it is far from mainstream, by Fricke's own standards it feels like it. Look at it like this: If you want a deep look into original Cinematography, get any of his other projects. However, if you're coming from a normal background, this movie can really move you in that sense. It's more of a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, really. It shows off a little bit of everything, but at the sacrifice of depth. There ARE a few moments that deserve thier own viewing, and if you have seen ANY of Fricke's other projects then don't miss this one, but otherwise, if you want to see the same thing more or less, but in much greater depth, check out the rest of his work.
068818071X|5.0|I found Marian Keyes 'by accident,' having bought Watermelon and Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married based on reviews I read here and then forgetting about them.  But before I was halfway through Lucy, which I read first, I'd already scoured Amazon to see what other books the wonderful Keyes has written and thus obtained Rachel's Holiday.  While this book deals with issues the other books touched on, it explores them more thoroughly, magically combining the serious and hilarious with great results.<br />Rachel is one of the Walsh sisters introduced in Watermelon, and we meet her just as her family is rushing her off to rehab, her resistance somewhat worn down by the knowledge that celebrities often dry out in what must be a very posh place.  The book takes us through Rachel's stay, her reaction to being there, her denial, her interaction with others, the process of beginning to see and understand herself, all intercut with flashbacks of her previous life that illustrate clearly for the reader how Rachel perceives her actions and how others do.<br />It's a very serious topic - drug addiction - and Keyes treats it with respect, not overdoing things, but also approaches it realistically, revealing the humor when it should be there and, above all, never condescending to the characters or readers.  She somehow makes it all fun and engrossing without diminishing the gravity of the subject.  Even though I truly enjoyed Keyes' other books, I was very pleasantly surprised by how complicated and mature this one was, and I recommend it without hesitation to pretty much everyone.

B00003CXB2|5.0|This is the sort of film that is, whichever way you look at it, whatever your interests in the true story this is based on, really very good indeed. It centres around the life of TE Lawrence (a dazzling central performance by Peter O'Toole), a character who led an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. His superiors see him as an undisciplined waste of time, disliking his insubordination and lack of willingness to the rules (as one extremely amusing scene at the start when Lawrence is consigned to go to try and assist the uprising against the Turks), and his equals see him as a bit of an eccentric.  When Lawrence goes to try and assist in the Arab revolt, he meets up with headstrong young Arab Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif, giving off the best performance of the movie), and manages to get both the help of the various tribes and that of the Arab leader, the enigmatic Prince Feisel (Alec Guinness, rather underused but, in one scene where he meets Lawrence, really quite good), in order to take several of the main Turkish cities. Mocked but also feared when he returns by the soldiers, he becomes a changed man, who quite willingly would kill (the scene where he tells Jack Hawkins how he personally enjoyed killing some people is excellent, with O'Toole performing extremely well), whereas at the start his superiors saw him as both a fool and insubordinate.  It is unclear what David Lean's morals are, perhaps that the man who does not simply follow orders and does what he thinks is right is correct, as Lawrence finds himself consistently going against what the officers tell him yet still achieving better than was originally intended.  There is a solid supporting cast, with all performing to the best of their abilities, Anthony Quinn is his best role ever as a headstrong Arab chieftain, and Arthur Kennedy as a media-hungry journalist desperate for a story turning Lawrence into a hero.  This could have been deathly dull. There is nothing pointing to love interest, no huge battles, not even much by way of dialogue, and it does not conclude fully either. Lawrence, a homosexual, is hinted at this with his \\"poncy\\" attitude (which cleverly changes very believably by O'Toole), his willingness to accept servants which were in fact rent boys in reality and his frankly ridiculous dress, which could suggest he's just like the Arabs, but in fact is willingly wearing it, and enthusiastically prancing around in it in the scene where the train is attacked. The real character of Lawrence is not really performed, with it just seeming to be a homosexual stereotype slowly turning into an ordinary man, willing to see death when he was once afraid of it. But in Lawrence of Arabia, a story is being told, simply, frankly, and with beautiful desert shots and a truly excellent score.  The image of Ali coming out of nowhere in the \\"mirage\\" scene is a truly great scene in cinema history, and ranks along the shower scene in Psycho. It has direction as beautiful as any you would see, and the long, inspiring desert shots would be truly breathtaking in the cinema.  Very little is wrong with this film, which is a classic adventure story riddled with sub-plots (Lawrence's slow acceptance to the Arab ways, the superiors initial dislike for Lawrence eventually becoming a respect), but the plot is not really important to the film. After all, there are hardly plots to what happens in real life.
B00005LMBK|2.0|Do not be fooled like I was.  When I saw the video of Clint Eastwood for the first time, I thought to myself WOW.  I immediately picked up the record, and was very disappointed to say the least.  I read a few online reviews of this record earlier (some good, many bad) and then decided to buy it.  If for nothing else than the song Clint Eastwood.<br />Well, I put it into my player and started to play the first few tracks.  Hmmm, OK, let's skip one, another one...wait where is Clint Eastwood.  Ah, finally, Track 5, Clint Eastwood.  Good song, after that...let's skip this one too, not my music.  At the end of Track 11 I think to myself &quot;What the hell?&quot;  This is getting worse by the minute...I don't know, some people might like rap-funk hybrids like this.  It is not me.<br />Go listen to the entire record before you purchase.  Then you will decide whether it is worth it.  My copy is on eBay however.  Ohhh, 2 stars were given for the cartoon characters.  They are damn cool...True.
6300214435|5.0|I don't know how anyone could hate &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.&quot; Sure, it's darker and more violent than its predecessor, but I like dark movies (see my review for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;). Although not as good as &quot;Raiders,&quot; &quot;ToD&quot; does have its moments. The Shanghai opening, the mine cart chase, the rope bridge, etc. Its got all the action of an Indiana Jones flick, so why do people hate it? Maybe it's Willie, or Short Round.
0060392886|1.0|Pick up just about any tell-all book about a rock-n-roll group written in the last 20-30 years and it will probably tell you much of what you read here.  This is basically the same worn out story, just a different chapter, group, and year.  <br />What is the story?  Four self-centered morons with an ounce of musical talent struggle early on to make it big, while doing incredible amounts of drugs, booze and women.  The guys make it big, while continuing to do massive amounts of drugs, booze and women.  Guys hit the top, start to battle personal &quot;demons&quot; (due to the fact that they are all drug addicts now), start a downward spiral, recover to some extent, try to regroup, blah blah blah, yada yada yada.<br />The fans of the group will like this book.  The person with higher than average intelligence who has read a few books like this before will be bored, insulted, and maybe only occasionally amused.  This is a book about incredibly shallow, stupid, selfish, filthy, ridiculous people who have served absolutely no purpose in this world other than to make some really bad music.<br />Yes, they are washed up now.  Thank goodness.  Unfortunately, another moronic band (several come to mind) that is enjoying their rise to the top while doing incredible amounts of drugs, booze and women will probably assault us with the same sad published story next year.
B00005B36H|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first...when I heard Adam Jones singing on the first track I thought I was going to be in for a shock...and I was. The most visionary, hard, emotional music I've heard in a long time. I listen to a lot of different styles of music; Dream Theater, Boy Sets Fire, Megadeth, and now, more than anything else, Tool. I wasn't a huge fan until after I bought this album (though many of my friends' Tool albums have somehow ended up at my house before and after this purchase). This has hard songs, intricate guitars through the hard and the soft, a song that hits ya like a buzzsaw to the head and a song right after that bandages the wound before the next blow. Maynard's troubled life comes through in vocals about separation and people being used and many other topics. I am very, very pleased with this album and I encourage many people, even people I don't know, to buy this CD. If someone's looking at CD's...I tell them: &quot;Tool's newest album Lateralus is one of the best ever, you need to get it.&quot; And those statements are true, one of the best albums ever, everyone needs to get it.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I love a movie that challenges me as a viewer and this movie definitely did that. The non-dialog, non-soundtrack portion of the film is original and different and challenging. I have decided I loved the uniqueness because they weren't there just to stretch but as storytelling techniques. I left my initial viewing not knowing for sure how I felt about it. During the film I was intensly interested in Tom Hanks and his performance as well as what his character's next step would be. So, when watching the DVD, seeing the film for the second time, I was just as involved in the tale. In addition to the excellent film this DVD included the kinds of things we are growing to not only love but expect from DVDs. The &quot;how it was done&quot; feature was great as was the vollyball feature and I just loved the Charlie Rose/Hanks interview. Anytime Hanks or Bob Zemmekes (spelling?) has something to say about the film I was facinated. I loved both discs in the two disc set and I know that from time to time I will pull out this gem and enjoy it all over again.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I went into the movie theatre not knowing what to expect from Moulin Rouge.  The reviews that I had heard of it were anything but complimentary, but I was intrigued by the resurgence of a musical.<br />I was utterly astounded after watching the movie!  The plot was simple and sometimes easy to predict.  But Baz Louhrman outdid himself.  What the plot lacked the music more than made up for.  Taking pop music and reorchestrating it, Louhrman created a device that works to carry the emotions of the characters far better than any dialogue ever could.  Especially fantastic was the use of Queen's &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; and Christian and Satine's duet &quot;Come What May&quot;!<br />My girlfriend said it best as we walked out of the theatre, &quot;At first I wondered what you had gotten us into, but that was an amazing movie!&quot;
6304539258|5.0|It's hard not to like &quot;Star Wars.&quot; It's got everything you want in a movie. Its got space battles, shootouts, and lightsaber duels. I will say little more than that this is a great movie. If you are one of the five people who hasn't seen this movie BUY IT NOW!!!!!!
0316776963|2.0|I found this book exceptionally unexceptional.  The author's greatest talent seems to be at surrounding himself with interesting people who are themselves funny and noteworthy.  It's a good, light read but nothing that hasn't been done (in fiction and non-fiction) for years by the likes of Woody Allen, Philip Roth, Henry Rollins...
B000056N8X|2.0|I am a Highlander fan and I liked this flick infanitely more than the other sequals, but it just didn't quite make it. The concepts are interesting and even &quot;cool&quot; and I did have some guilty pleasures, but who let those bad-guy motorcycle guys in? That, and several other lapses of sillyness just punched holes in the good points of the film.  Typically, fans will like this flick better than two stars, but not love it. Non-fans should stay far away and might rate this in the turkey range. Still a helluva lot better than some tripe in theaters.
6303149200|4.0|I saw this film because I have recently become a big fan of British horror film actor Christopher Lee.  He is the last surviving great horror film actor and one of the last of the great movie villains.  Unfortunately, Lee has rarely gotten roles that do real justice to his great talent.  &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; is an exception.  <br />A Scottish Christian fundamentalist police officer(Edward Woodward of TV's &quot;The Equalizer&quot;) receives an anonymous letter reporting a missing child on a nearby pagan-inhabited island.  Woodward travels to the island, which is governed by pagan lord Christopher Lee.  Woodward's religious beliefs harshly clash with the views of the pagan inhabitants as he searches for the missing child.  The film climaxes in what is arguably the greatest twist-ending in film history.<br />&quot;The Wicker Man&quot; is the archetype of a great renaissance film.  The film successfully combines several different genres, including the Horror film, Detective story, Mystery movie, Drama, Satire, and Musical.  There is no other movie like it.<br />Christopher Lee gives the greatest performance of his career.  He was fifty years old when he made this movie but he looks several years younger.  Lee has said that &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; offered him his favorite role and I believe him.  He is absolutely charismatic as the suave and ruthless Lord Summerisle.  Lee is far more effective in this film than he was in any of his Dracula movies.  <br />Not only Lee but also screenwriter Anthony Shaffer should have been nominated for Oscars.  The film has the most creative dialogue that I have ever seen in a movie.<br />I have already seen this movie seven times and could stand to see it seven times more.  Well-recommended.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I like this movie, it's OK. I don't plan on watching it often as it will most likely get tired fast. But when I want to see a sample of some very, VERY good acting, then this is where I'll go.<br />Tom Hanks does a great job. Those vacant looks, anger, frustration, excitment, they are all very convincing. The slimed down version of Mr. Hanks after 4 years on the island is a pretty stunning transformation. And talk about a beard or bad hair day. WOW!<br />I can see where this movie is not going to be very popular as there is not a lot of action, special effects, or even sound track. It's very minimal in nature. If one watches the special features on the second disk, then the point of the movie will be very clear. There are many additional features on the 2nd disk, most of which could be lived without (&quot;Life and Death of a Hollywood Extra&quot; for example).<br />If I may, try these when you listen/watch this movie. Notice that there is no music or 20th century sound on the island. Listen hard for it, it's really relaxing in a way. You'll notice that it's very hard to listen to the nothingness of the film. Then make sure to listen hard after the return. There are some great points being made. Pay special attention to the Elvis selections that appear during the movie. Very interesting choices. Finally, watch Mr. Hanks' eyes. There lies the story, and amazingly so.<br />You'll enjoy this movie at home, especially with a home theater or quality stereo surround sound stereo. Don't watch it often, as the &quot;I'm tired of it&quot; syndrome will develop quickly. Bravo to Mr. Hanks and the crew in making the film. Lastly, do not watch this film if you're going somewhere on a plane a few days after seeing it.....
B000002NC4|5.0|Most artists excel at either writing lyrics or composing music. Martsch did both.  What a guy eh?
B000001EUL|5.0|The Scorpions have largely faded from the limelight in recent years but when taking a look at their rather large catalog, this album is truely outstanding. I have a wide variety of musical tastes but this disc is not only my favorite Scorpions disc but one of my very favorite in my entire collection. There are timeless ballads like &quot;Holiday&quot; and also songs such as &quot;Another Piece of Meat&quot; featuring the Germans at their hardest. The instrumental &quot;Coast To Coast&quot; is thickly emotional despite having no lyrics to convay any feeling. They also have a song &quot;Loving You Sunday Morning&quot; unlike any in their catalog that most resembles a rock/regae hybrid. A great disc, available both with the original &quot;bubblegum&quot; cover and the newer drawn scorpion.
B000002ARV|5.0|This CD is never mentioned in all of those &quot;top 100&quot; collections in major magazines, but this is what it's ALL about!  Only a man with the blues in his veins can turn it into hard rock like this.  And there's a couple of good country tracks, bitchin' Stones covers (his version of &quot;Silver Train&quot; is better IMHO), &quot;Too Much Secanol&quot; features Winter on a National Guitar, and his cover of Lucille is funky and nasty.  A great bonus inclusion!  But what's really about are tracks like &quot;Still Alive And Well&quot;, &quot;All Tore Down&quot;, and the like.  Put it in the car, crank it up, and go rockin' down the highway and discover one of the lost gems of the seventies, and indeed ALL rock albums.  You can't do better.
0440214041|5.0|This is my favorite Grisham novel, and I can not say enough good things about it.  He is devious and clever in his writing, capturing our attention as well as our imagination.<br />Grisham has created a story about the biggest government cover-up since Watergate.  It is sensational, realistic, and immensly frightening.  It is beautiful.  It is destructive.  And should definantly be read.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|In my opinion one of the greatest metal albums ever. 3 Guitarists, thundering bass, pounding drums, and Bruce Dickonsin one of metal's greatest singers. Nothing is wrong with Brave New World.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I ever thought I would in the theater and have enjoyed showing the DVD to people who had real doubts about its ability to entertain them at all. This is a fun movie, but more than that, it fits in enough drama and characterization to rise about standard action fare. It didn't try to be brilliant, but it tried to be thoughtful and good and it succeeded. Few will proclaim it a masterpiece, including me, but I will call it entertaining fun with a soul. I have shown it to many non-comic people and have always been pleased by their surprisingly favorable feedback.<br />For what it is worth, I hope the good folks at Fox are making another solid script and director Brian Singer priorities for the sequal. I hope they don't, but fear they will count on just the X-Men name to carry subsequent films because that is not what made this show financially successful or good.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|It's not often a movie surprises and entertains me. But this one does. It's slapstick and serious and musical and dramatic, all at the same time. And best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously. With all of the &quot;art&quot; film that's been made over the last 20 years, it's nice to see a movie that's just plain fun and still takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Plenty of eye candy for Gen-Xer's too. The music was well scored and arranged and cleverly integrated to fit the story line. Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are surprising and the chemistry was wonderful. I plan to get this on DVD as soon as it's available. This goes high on my musicals list next to the Sherman Bros. &quot;The Slipper And The Rose&quot;. All artists take note. It will appeal to that artsy side of your brain.
0385484518|4.0|This book is great if you're dealing with death in your family, or if you just happen to like the essay genre (like me), otherwise this book is a little dry for pleasure reading. The man was a college professor, after all, and this book reads somewhat like a lecture. If you can get past that, this book has some wonderful insights, not just on death but on how to live life as well. As Morrie himself might have said, \\"Death isn't worth anything if you don't live well beforehand, and face it cheerfully.\\" This book shows you how. Excellent!!!
B00001IVOF|5.0|Mobb Deep's word's penitrate to the core. Forcing all those listening, to visualize their portray'll. Wich is depicted verbally through a captivating format. This album will drag you into a violent demension, as it relay's a deadly reality.         The aggression is released in a calm style, with sentences that are realistically felt.           These two partner's in crime, always display painstaking effort within their work's of art.       Many dark nights have fallen upon us, since my investment in this cd was made. And to this day, nearly every track dosent have what it takes, to be considered played out.
0553573403|5.0|I read a lot in a lot of different genres, and the &quot;Song of Ice &amp; Fire&quot; series is a bright star in today's books lists. Martin has spun a great yarn that is compelling from the first chapter. The book must be classified as fantasy but it reads like historical fiction and never is Martin's world less than real. He spins many plot threads with many characters jumping from chapter to chapter leaving the reader &quot;breathless.&quot; Martin is not afraid to kill major characters and doesn't bog down his story with anything that isn't essential keeping his epic tale big, but not overwhelming or unweildy. The only real negative for me, is that after reading Martin's tale and seeing is word skill on display, everything else I pick is lacking.
0805053883|5.0|Okay, so you might not be able to make the sounds of the animals (what does a  walrus and flamingo really sound like anyway?) but the words they use in this book really help out.  With words like &quot;snarling&quot; or &quot;hissing&quot; or &quot;yelping&quot; or trumpeting&quot;, it's easy to change your voice and use your body and face to &quot;become&quot; the appropriate animal when you read those words.  My 2-year old daughter listened carefully when I read the book for the first time, then took the book and &quot;read&quot; it back to me.  Well, she only got the &quot;(animal name), (animal name), what do you see?&quot; as she paged through the book but it only took a few more days before she pretty much memorized all the lines.  This only happens with a few books (like The Napping House or Clothesline) so I was pretty surprised.  I think it's great for kids to learn other animal names, like peacock and hippopatamus, and other words like for the sounds they make.  It gets tiring to always read about puppies and kittens or farm and jungle animals.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool just keeps getting better and better. This album and all that came before it by Tool are worth whatever money you dish out for them. You CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH TOOL!  TOOL ROCKS...
B00003TL18|5.0|This CD is so wonderful.  Roy is accompanied by Bruce Sprintstein, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, and K.D.Lang.  One of my favorite selections has instrumental sections by Roy, Bruce and Elvis.  A keeper for any Orbison fan!
B000000OTU|3.0|Unfortunately, while Aerosmith became more succesful than ever with it's pop-rock reinvention of the 1980's, they lost a lot of what made them great in the 70's.  They went from an album-oriented raw-rock'n'roll outfit to a singles-oriented, heavily produced ballad band.  So while the album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, a chronicle of their biggest singles from the 70's, seems a little too forward and quite unnecessary, &quot;Big Ones&quot; is almost essential for their newer fans.  Why wade through the filler of &quot;Permeneant Vacation&quot; or &quot;Get a Grip&quot; when they only songs that got much thought can be acquired on a more consistant hits collection?  Still, their newer hits - &quot;Cryin'&quot; &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, &quot;Living on the Edge&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; -  are so damn similar it's almost overwhelming and kind of repetitive having them on the same CD.  So Big Ones is both fitting and too much.  Of course, they tack on two previously unreleased songs to hook the fans who already have most of it, but they are hardly essential.  If you've got the albums, don't bother; but &quot;Big Ones&quot; is the best way to get any post-rehab Aerosmith if you need it.
6302293553|5.0|I loved this movie.  I heard about it from 3 boys, my liberrin and, my uncle.  So I decided to rent it, I watched it the first day and did not stop watching it until I had to give it back.  I am young and I watched it during summer vacation witch is the best time.  I like the TV show too
B00003CWL6|3.0|Though it may not be a great film, American Beauty is quite a good movie and I recommend seeing it. It's lushly photographed and well acted. It has an entertaining and unpredictable plot. All this is true, but it may be the most manipulative film I have ever seen. It is as if American Beauty is taunting its audience, &quot;I can make you see or feel anything thing I want! I can even make you believe you are being manipulated!&quot; American Beauty is the Penn and Teller of movies: it's like an illusionist pretending to debunk illusionists. It will use you then intentionally make you feel used.<br />Certainly, you should see and enjoy this film, and the DVD is well worth owning, but remember this: a roller coaster is not a bus and will not take you anyplace useful.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|The cracking of the enigma code played an integral part of the allied war effort of World War II.  The Germans had developed and nearly perfected a code machine capable of sending accurate messages swiftly without fear of interception due to it's complexities.  It was important for the allies to not only get their hands on an enigma code machine but to decipher its ever-changing code.<br />U-571 builds its premise around this exciting and disturbing event but the film, itself, is anything but exciting.  It merely attempts to ride on the coattails of other submarine films such as The Hunt For Red October and Das Boot, including all of the suspense devices that it can squeeze into its 2 hours.<br />Matthew McConaughey plays Lt. Tyler, an ambitious young marine officer wanting his own naval commission.  'I don't think so' says his Captain (portrayed woodenly by Bill Paxton).  Apparently Tyler would not be capable of making the tough decisions, risking lives for the mission or the greater cause.  Disappointed, Tyler wonders what his next mission will be, succumbed to the thought that he will forever be a submarine's second in command.<br />But this is WWII and his next mission is revealed quickly - to disguise their US submarine as a German submarine, find another German submarine stranded somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic, pretend to be Germans, board the real German submarine, steal their enigma machine and get out of sight before the real Germans arrive.  But the catch is to ensure that the Germans remain completely unaware that the enigma machine is gone.  Otherwise, the Germans will abandon its use.<br />Through a course of events including submarines catching on fire, going far beneath its depth capabilities, and continuous carpet bombings, Tyler is forcibly given his own command.  Will he have what it takes to be a submarine captain?  Will he be able to risk lives for the sake of the greater cause?<br />More bombs, more fires, more plummeting submarines and- yes - an opportunity to send a man to his death are soon to follow without surprise.  As an audience, we are asked to feel for the officers who are risking life and limb for truth, justice, and the American way.  It is an almost impossible feat with U-571 as the characters are simply used as plot devices for the film.  If the producers wanted to reach the success of Red October or Das Boot, they should have realised that it is the boat that is the plot device and it is the characters that provide the story - not the other way around.<br />The film fails as it is simply bland and unoriginal in its character development, or lack thereof, and its action sequences.  But more importantly, and more shamelessly, is that it rewrites history without embarrassment or concern.  Although it mentions in its end credits that this was a work of fiction, it still gives the impression that these events at least bordered on accuracy.  <br />The enigma machine did exist and was captured by the British forces.  The British were also able to board a submarine and steal an enigma code book.  And the British were eventually able to crack the enigma code.  Certainly, these events could be made into an exciting film, not just one which is merely watchable.
B00003CXS4|4.0|After one viewing of Snatch I admit that I had no idea what these guys were saying half the time. Almost all of the actors had extremely thick english, irish or russian accents and talked very fast. I honestly needed subtitles to understand it all. <br />I did like Snatch though. I love Guy Ritchie's style of film making. Very slick. I will watch it again.....with subtitles on!
B00004TJFL|5.0|This Movie Starts Of With The Ending Of &quot;Halloween 4:The Return Of Michael Myers&quot;.Michael was blown in this mineshaft.Evreyone thought he was dead but michael escaped. Once again he is out for a killing spree and he is also back to try and kill his niece Jamie.
B0000027RL|4.0|It just happens to be thier first. True they havent been all that great since Neil Young started influencing (poisoning) thier sound. Forget about Alive, Jeremy, Evenflow and Black. You've all heard those countless times before. The other songs are what makes this worth having. Ocean, why go, deep, all great songs that you can feel what Eddie and the rest of the band were trying get you to feel. Yeah, I have VS. and Vitology but they couldnt measure up to TEN.
0060925000|5.0|Reading this book was one of the more beautiful times in my life. This is the reason I read. To be brought into lives and places that stay with me always! I felt like I had lost something when I finished the book and often think about it and know that I will read it again very soon. I hope beyond hope that Vikram Seth will some day decide to continue the saga of the families in this story. Do yourself a favour and read it, you won't be sorry!
B00003CX95|5.0|Yeah, I know, you've seen the movie and loved it. But is it really worth getting on DVD? YES!!! Not only do you not have to get up in the middle and swith tapes but the extras are excellent. I have watched the movie a ton of times and I still cant get bored of it. My favorite extra on the disc is Mel Gibson's commentary. Normally on DVDs you get commentary from the people in the film or the directors and special effects guys and they babble on about little detail things. Mel Gibson who you know directed BRAVEHEART gives an extremly insightful commentary. He tells you the real story of William Wallace while he is telling you facts about how met some of the people in this movie and problems they had while making the movie. You cant go wrong buying this movie.
6304508611|5.0|Carrie is a stylish, well-cast, immensely powerful movie. Sissy Spacek is amazing as Carrie, a tortured teenager who discovers her considerable telekinetic abilities and attempts to take control of her life. Just when she seems to be truly happy for the first time in her short, miserable existence, a cruel classmate hauls out a grotesque practical joke that amuses everyone and leaves Carrie enraged beyond the point of endurance. What follows is one of the most terrifying and satisfying sequences in movie history. <br />When Carrie finally got even at the prom, I was on her side all the way, because--and I don't care who criticizes me for this--THEY DESERVED IT. Carrie wanted to avoid such an incident, but they made it impossible. This movie and its fans have taken a lot of heat lately because of certain events in the news, when common sense will tell you that if you torment someone enough, their self-control will give out and they will strike back. The best way to prevent violence is to leave people the hell alone, but no one seems to understand that. <br />I feel as I can realate to Carrie. I have been mad fun of in school and I have actually been known to want to do some of the things Carrie does. Sometimes I wish I had the powers she had so I could do the things she does. All I Have is ESP... oh well back to the movie... Carrie is a movie I could see 1 MILLION times and NEVER get tired of it. <br />\\"Everybody will laugh at you!\\" <br />It's funny how 5 words can mean so much to a person. I will never forget the image of this pale girl, with a look on her face of horror, embarassment, shame and raw emotion, covered in blood and through her eyes, the whole gymnasium, stands and laughs heartlessly at her humiliation. <br />Carrie was a landmark for me, as I'm sure it was for a certain Mr King. It displayed for the whole world to see that school,(high school, secondary school) could actually be hell. In my mind Sissy Spacek was born to play Carrie White. She encapsulated all the emotions and feelings so well, your heart couldn't help but go out to her. In my mind this is a horror, but not in the sense of Carrie White's telekinesis, but of life, and of the people in it. Those who just wanna push things that little bit too far, for some nondescript reason. The girls squealing for Carrie to \\"plug it up\\" when she gets her first period and has no idea what it is, and when they start throwing tampons at her, is alot more frightening than most of the episodes of Carrie's telekinesis,(with the exception of the 2 final incidents). Piper Laurie's excellent portrayal of the religiously fanatical Magaret White, her determination that Carrie is first dirty and polluted which eventually gives way to her belief that Carrie is evil, is disturbing viewing especially considering that at the crux of this all, Carrie is her child. A WORD OF WARNING: De Palma's version differs from Stephen Kings novel, however that does not make it bad, since the initial essence is there. Carrie is an unfortunate victim of circumstance, trapped in a world that she does not control, one thread that is evident in both the film and the novel is that Carrie's ultimate empowerment and her decision (arguably based on instinct and reaction)to initiate it, leads to destruction of the town and finally of herself, but throughout the whole thing she remains, unsure and often even unaware. <br />Carrie is a victim you care about and you understand the revenge she exacts upon her classmates and the redeemed Sue Snell(Amy Irving), however, you get the feeling that Snell's attempts to bring Carrie happiness is slightly a case of trying to forgive herself for descending into madness in the girls locker room. <br />The final scene (one of the best classic endings of a film ever:discuss!?) is a final triumph for Carrie, her final revenge, her gift to Sue Snell, her legacy. But throughout the whole film, never was this more a case of just an innocent victim of circumstance. A triumphfor King and De Palma, (plus a chance for De Palma to home his skills down, in particular his trademark split screen filming). If any parent ever said life was easy for kids, sit them down and make them watch Carrie. <br />This movie is a must for those who can understand its themes. The low budget is utilized to great effect. The art direction is wonderful, illustrating the pain and horror lurking in everyday life--the White bungalow, for example, seems like any other house on the outside, but is a jumble of shadows and twisted religious images inside. Director Brian De Palma is at his flamboyant best, especially during the nightmarish split-screen climax. Piper Laurie excels as Margaret, Carrie's fanatical mother from hell, and provides some very frightening moments. And of course, the image of Sissy Spacek covered in blood, except for her bulging blue eyes, is one that will remain with me forever... <br />The Ending is the best part besides the prom... (....)
B00001ODGR|5.0|Styx with Dennis Deyoung (as it should be).  This was a great concert of most of the classic Styx.  Video quality and sound is superb.  I'm really glad I bought it.
B00005A3KS|1.0|I loved \\"Piont Break\\" ever since the day it came out in theatres. I own it on the VHS but it was not Widescreen. When the DVD came out I thought how great it would be to finally see this film the way it was meant to be seen, Widescreen. But when I got the DVD I noticed the horror of what has been done to it. This version is NOT Widescreen, it is not even the cropped version we saw on the VHS. The picture is just CUT even further and added with \\"black bulks\\" on top and bottom to CHEAT the Widescreen effect. The picture is so much CUT DOWN that sometimes it's not even clear what is going on. Buying this DVD is like paying to watch only 40% of the film. This is bad, SHAME on the people at FOX HOME VIDEO. Don't buy this DVD....seeing it like this is going to ruin the experience and this great film. They should make a real Widescreen/Especial edition to do the justice that this great action film deserves.
B000007MVD|5.0|This CD will give the listener a view into The Beatles prior to 1964.  Many of the songs are from their playlist going back to their Hamburg days.  Most of the selections are just the four  Beatles, no double tracking, no studio magic, just their normal gig performances, done for the BBC radio microphones.   One striking feature to me is the excellence of George Harrison's  lead guitar.  He is and was one of the very best.  His lead work goes beyond what was typical and expected of that day and is a precursor of what rock guitar would become. He is a master  of the Rock-a-billy style, yet with a definite Liverpool sound.  Their wit, humour, and incredible charisma also is very evident in the chat with the various MCs prior to playing.  The CD also  gives fascinating insight into the popular music of the early 60s, just prior to the British invasion.   Live At The BBC is a must have not only for the Beatles fan, but anyone interested in music history of the 20th Century.
B00003CXRP|2.0|I was disappointed.  I expected something emotionally moving, grand performances, something.  I didn't expect to be bored by the story.  I wanted to fast-forward, but I didn't.  I kept thinking &quot;you'll miss something&quot;... but no sir, nothing to miss.  Sad, boring, depressing movie.
0064407667|5.0|Having picked up this book out of curiousity, I immediately bought everything available.  I enjoy the wit, the word definitions, the references to Beatrice, the non-sequitor author descriptions at the back, and even the ludicrous invention solutions (although I admit some concern over Sunny's teeth what with staple-making and wall-climbing).  Even though you can often see where things are headed, you keep reading to see just what the narrator will say.  In addition, I recommend the...website, particularly the Count Olaf song.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|What a gorgeous movie!  Camera work jumped around a bit for me, made my spouse nautious, but we both loved it.  The romantic chemistry was fabulous, the character actors were superb, the opening dance scenes at the Moulin Rouge are worth the price of the show!  Spectacular!  Spectacular!  When Ewan broke into song in her bedroom inside the elephant, I almost cried and my heart almost burst.   A movie Nicole Kidman can be proud of for the rest of her life, truly a beautiful showcase of her talent.  Bravo!
B00000FCBC|1.0|One star because that is the lowest rating I can give!  This CD wouldn't be so bad if it was left in the original format as Garage Days Revisited.  Instead Metallica insists on placing substandard new songs on a perfectly good CD, adding the B-sides from all the CD-Singles (which the true fans already have).  If you HAVE to have this disk, keep in mind that only one or two songs on the first disk are worthwhile, and the only real reason for the disk set to exist is for the first 4 songs on disk 2.  God I miss Cliff!  What happended to this band?
0385501560|5.0|Oh jeez, I was completely dumbfounded when I finished reading CHOKE, and that means Palahniuk has done it again. I've read all his books, more than once, and CHOKE is a masterpiece none the less. It is hard to say if CHOKE is better then FIGHT CLUB, I really can't tell. But with such a original and plot twisting story as CHOKE it is bound to make your top ten list. Trust me on this, Chuck Palahniuk is my own personal Jesus Christ.
0060278234|5.0|You have to read this book. It is filled with everything anyone could want, romance,emotion,magic,and a plot that could be that book, what was it Harry who? <br />The only thing that could be better than reading this book is living it.

B000002UW1|5.0|Nary a jangly, navel-gazing moment on the set, 1987's Document is the zenith of the REM catalog in my opinion.  With a harder, darker, and uncharacteristically angry vibe throughout, this guitar fueled set is full of Buck's trademark arpeggioed riffs and one of the clearer lyrical offerings of Stipe's career.  Its a loud reaction to Reagan-era imperialism (as Joe Strummer would say, &quot;a political announcement with GUITARS!&quot;) and a breakthrough album for a band heretofore known mostly through the college radio grapevine.  Starting off with the rolling &quot;Finest Worksong&quot; and dashing off one catchy song after another, the album doesn't let up until the last feedback drenched notes of the ominous &quot;Oddfellows Local 151.&quot;  In between are the classics &quot;ITEOTW&quot; and &quot;The One I Love,&quot; the unique overplayed radio hit that still sounds good, and the taunting corporate/political kiss-off &quot;Exhuming McCarthy.&quot;  There isn't a bad song on the disc and the band's sound and politics may never have been more in your face. Superb.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Orsen Welles is a genius.  You've probably heard that a million times, but what is it about this movie that can elevate a director to such status?   For starters, Welles was an innovator in such mundane fields as equipment and lighting.  He innovated numerous ways of lighting his set which allowed him to achieve shots with large depths of field or backlighting.  He also invented equipment which allowed him to achieve tracking shots that were unheard of before his time.  You follow the camera over a rooftop and then down through a skylight into a room where a conversation is taking place.  It seems pretty standard today, but you don't see that sort of thing in films before Welles came along. There is so much more, though.  What is the big deal about shot with large depth of field?  Examine the scene in which Kane's parents and the executor of his uncle's will are arguing over his future.  The shot contains four characters.  The banker, who wants to take Kane away.  Kane's mother, who wants him to stay.  Kane's father, who is undecided.  And Kane himself as a child who can be seen through the window playing with Rosebud.  The banker is positioned close to the camera, the mother is positioned by the window, and the father wanders back and forth in the shot.  The very positions of these characters illuminates where they stand on the issue being discussed.  The father is the most obvious example of this, as he wavers back and forth in his decision he wanders back and forth in the room, moving closer to the banker or closer to his wife by the window and his son playing innocently outside.  This is one example of how Welles utilized the large depth of field shot which he created especially for such scenes as this.  There are no cuts, no panning, just the room, mapped out on each end with a decision, and he plays the characters against this map. Then there is the ending.  Rosebud is the sled?  What does that mean?  It means that the search that the faceless men have been onis a wild goose chase.  How can one item in a man's life define who that man is?  It can't, as is reflected by the jigsaw puzzles that Kane's wife does, or the long tracking shot at the end which covers all the items in Kane's life.  It doesn't matter if Kane's last thought was of his boyhood and the sled he used to play with.  That does not discount every decision he has made throughout his life, it does not change any of the plans which he set into effect, or alter any of the lives he has ruined as he traveled through life becoming less and less like the young, adventurous noble man he started out as when he first comes into the newspaper office.  He may long for his distant childhood, but every step he took away from that life was a step he took by himself, and simply longing for the past does not absolve anyone of responsibility for the decisions they have made throughout their life.
B000002NC4|5.0|What other artist, after signing a major label deal toward which he had presumably worked his whole life ,would record THIS album? Who else but Doug (Dug) Martsch? I know Built to Spill is a band, but I've always seen Dug as a kind of Brian Wilson character. That said, this album is like his &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. The genius of this band is the ability to craft a 3-minute hook-laden pop song, dream up some of the most inventive and wildly original arrangements, play those intricate arrangements using only basic rock instrumentation, and then stretch that song out to its logical or illogical conclusions. 8-minute songs are usually boring. These 8-minute songs aren't. There are vey few bands that manage to sound original or distinctive with just a bass-guitar-drums line-up. Sure, BTS add the occasional strings or keyboards, but at its core, it's a guitar-rock band. Instead of using an orchestra, theremin, movie projectors, vibes, etc. a la Flaming Lips, Dug uses his guitar to create the sounds, tones, and moods needed for the arrangements. When you hear Dug referred to as a &quot;guitar god&quot;, don't fear. You are not in for mechanical, &quot;technical&quot; or &quot;fast&quot; playing. Dug's genius is his ability to use the guitar as his own private orchestra, and to use those sounds and textures in service of the songs. He has an utterly distinctive tone, but also is able to shape-change into whatever kind of player the songs calls for. He's a guitar chameleon, and there aren't many guitarists you can say that about.  He can muster everything from heartbreakingly lyrical passages to storming walls of sound and stop at all points between. Just listen to the first track &quot;Randy Described Eternity&quot;. Much like the best Flaming Lips work, it uses odd-ball lyrics juxtaposed with transcendent music and ultimately builds to an emotional climax that defies logic or explanation. Just like you might wonder, whilst listening to &quot;Clouds Taste Metallic&quot;: 'How can a song about a giraffe have an emotional effect on me?', you'll find yourself puzzled at how a song that begins with a description of a huge shimmering sphere can raise goosebumps in your heart. To me, that perfectly encapsulates the perfect paradox that is Built to Spill, The Flaming Lips, and great music in general: The existence of both the ridiculous and sublime in the same place at the same time.
0684833395|5.0|This book is funny.  This book is the greatest parody of war ever written.  This book is a work of genius. I am amazed every time I read this book at how apropos the title is and how Heller manages to weave his main point, the absurdity of war, throughout every story in this book.  There is the classic scene in which the phrase Catch-22 is coined.  You can only leave the war if you are crazy, but if you have the mental capacity to want to leave the war then you must be sane.  An impossible situation for Yossarian, but what character does not live his life in accordance with absurdity? Major Major tells his secretary that no one is allowed in to his office to see him while he is in his office.  Chief White Halfcoat can not settle down anywhere because men searching for oil will uproot him to dig for crude wherever he sets down.  The man in Yossarian's tent can not be removed because he never signed in, but he can never sign in because he died before he was able to.  Milo strafes the men of his own division for money because the money he is making is for the men.  And all this time Snowden lays dying in the back.   Throughout all this absurdity this haunting little story line continues to appear about Snowden lying in the sunlight at the back of the plane shivering to death.  This is the most crucial moment in the book, for it is when Snowden spills his guts (literally) to Yossarian that the war becomes all too real.  People are dying, real people, people that Yossarian knows, and he is powerless to stop it or explain it.  It is during Snowden's death that Yossarian subscribes to this code of absurdity as all the other characters have in order to somehow cope with the concept of war.  There is a brilliant scene in which some new recruits come in to camp.  They are young and innocent.  They set up their stuff in Yossarian's tent.  They light Orr's wood, which was never to be used, and warm themselves over it.  They take the nameless man's belongings and simply chuck them outside, ignoring the logic trap which has kept this dead man alive for so long.  They are oblivious to the way things have been working in the world of this book because the war is still only a concept to them.  There is no need for them to buy into absurdity fully, for they have yet to come across something they cannot cope with.  Their Snowden is still alive, and their world still makes sense.   Catch-22 is not merely a funny book with quirky characters.  It is a testament to the only sort of mindset in which a war can make sense, the mindset of absurdity.
B000000WFU|4.0|Mmmm. When I was told that there was no meaning to the actual vocal sounds being sung, I sort of, wondered a little. It seemed a  bit like intellectual musical masturbation to me (excuse my language) . But then, I sat and thought. All those bands I listen to that sing in Gaelic or use really esoteric lyrics. Why do I listen to them? Aaah...the melody, the rythym, the atmosphere. It's just sound and form. Adiemus is pure melody and is like an impressionist's painting of all things &quot;world music and ethnicy!!&quot; The talent involved in making this album is unquestionable and there are one or two tracks that really up lift the soul. I just wish that person hadn't mentioned the meaningless lyrics......&quot;adi adi um bayae - adi um adi um ayae&quot;......sorry just can't get them out of my head.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I felt like I could really relate to this movie because I'm both in LOVE with music and with journalism. I think that it was very relalistic in its portrayl of musicians. Overall a wonderful movie that I could watch over and over.
0671578855|5.0|This book is dedicated to four separate authors, but it's really a Heyer book-that is, pure high comedy.  The title recalls Heyer's \\"A Civil Contract\\" but the book itself really recalls Heyer at her comedic best-say \\"The Grand Sophy' or \\"Cotillion\\".  Not in plot, mind you.  In *tone.*<br />I haven't read all the previous Vorkosigan books, but those I have seem to follow roughly the same action-`n-angst formula (though Bujold's formidable sense of humor is at all times evident.)  Not this time, though.  <br />Bujold can plot like nobody's business; in romantic comedy, this is a real plus.  The major story line concerns Miles Vorkogisan's courtship of `the Vor next door' Ekaterin.  But there are other protagonists-Miles' brother Mark and his lady-love, Kareen (her parents violently disapprove),  Lord Dono Vorruyter (who, um, used to be Lady Donna); and Kareen's three sisters.<br />They all have their moments, but some of the high points are: Miles' disastrous dinner party (when Lord Dono stuffs his napkin in his mouth and snorts through his nose to keep from laughing, you're tempted to join him); Lord Dono's arrival back on Barrayar from his transformation on Beta (the efforts of his Armsmen to coach him in male mannerisms are a hoot); Cordelia's acting as Baba for Mark and Kareen (laser beam meet butter); and the climatic vote in Vorhartung Castle.<br />As always, Bujold has points to make, but here she makes them so lightly you both laugh and agree.  <br />I first read this book in a library copy; but after reading it I immediately ordered a copy for myself.  I only do this when I intend to read and reread the book.  Highly recommended.
6300214710|3.0|when i saw this movie in 1991, i fell in love with it, because as a free spirit/outcast, i could relate to molly's character and the plight she goes through being different...<br />   i still like the movie, but i guess since i've become analytical, i have a habit of dissecting things...in the real world, the geeky girl or guy doesn't get the beautiful one. maybe on another planet , but not here...and while people tell us they admire originality, they really want people to be more like them...in a way, the columbine tragedy was the best thing that ever happened to america because  it forced people to see the marginalized as people, and they learned that the freaks do matter and shouldn't be dissed... one stars for the performances, one star for the cool psychedelic furs song, and one star for the people who don't want to fit in....
B000053VAF|5.0|I loved Clerks, which I hail as Kevin Smith's finest work to date.  However, a close second in my opinion is, without a doubt, Dogma.  From the starting disclaimer to the whimsical scenes with God finishing out the film, I was totally moved by this movie.  Its deep, yet funny; I originally thought that Jay &amp; Silent Bob (a staple throughout Smith's movies) would be out of place in a religious setting - I was totally wrong!  I could see the scene with Cardinal Glick (portrayed by George Carlin) introducing the &quot;Buddy Christ&quot; over and over again with the same amount of laughter.<br />The extra material, which I've been waiting ever so patiently for, is great as well.  Look for the &quot;Bethany Boo Hoo&quot; scene - one which should've made the final cut.  I did, however, find it somewhat of a relief that some scenes were deleted (the s**t demon / hospital scene was a perfect example).<br />I'm overly impressed with this special edition.  I look forward to the summer release of &quot;The Return of Jay &amp; Silent Bob&quot;.
1565114159|3.0|I won't go into the content of Christensen's book, since most professionals who purchase it already know it's a seminal work on the pursuit of innovative new businesses by established firms.  What I will go into is how the CD misses the concept of digital media.  I have a 2001 Subaru Forester whose stereo has no problems playing audio CDs track by track.  However, on Innovator's Dilemma, it appears that there is only 1 track per 100+ minute CD. A single track means that if you want to, say, listen to another CD before finishing this audio-book, you're hosed.  With only 1 track, one can only start from the beginning.  Turn down the volume at the drive-thru order window and an hour of driving later realize the CD was still playing?  Start at the beginning again.  Miss part of an excerpt because you got distracted in traffic?  With only a single track, there's no rewinding except to restart from the beginning....
0783225792|2.0|If you already own the tape, don't bother buying the DVD.  The quality is sub par and with all that surrounded this movie you would think that there wouild have been some extras.  There is nothing.  Hopefully someone will come out with a SE version.
6305169187|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  Although it's not a thriller, I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  This movie is a lot like the movie Deep Impact, only WAY better.  It isn't slow and boring.  Armageddon has lots of explosions and is filled with action.  There's also some emotional scenes that might make some cry.  In addition, it has great music to it, and at the end there's a music video from Aerosmith.  I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing is a great song!  Armageddon is a great movie!
B000002UDD|4.0|So Far So Good is not one of Megadeths best albums but it certainly isn't their worst. The two words that best describe this CD is RAW &amp; MEAN! The production leaves something to be desired but overall this is a true metal classic. Dave has really improved within the last 13 yrs since this album was released. The guitar work is fast &amp; furious. My favorite songs include &quot;My Darkest Hour&quot;, &quot;Hook in Mouth&quot; &amp; &quot;Liar&quot;. This CD is worth picking up.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz catch me when i was looking MTV watching the Clint Eastwood Video. I recognize Damon From once. I always thought that Damon or in less, the Albarn projects, are real original and greats. When i began to understan de idea of the Gorillaz, with the other 3 members i inmediatily bought the CD before it was too late. Too late because i thought that this will be a &quot;radio-media-explosion&quot;. But after i realized that Gorillaz concept is just for people with a little more of &quot;mature-thinking&quot;. It´s the perfect album that introduces you to a dark world, but without terrible scractches, and distorsions...&quot;Latin Simone&quot; it´s Dark latin....&quot;M1A1&quot; is great, with the great intro. Even the Funny &quot;19-2000&quot; is really catching. All songs are different between them....and all are good ones...<br />     The great voice of 2Damon Albarn with the great sounds of Rusel Funky Homosapien and Noodle yamamoto, all comanding by the Dark and satanic Murdoc Hewlett....Makes this as a album that you have to buy, just for General culture....Even if you don´t like music.<br />    I recommended to you, once you have this one, go and obtain the songs &quot;Dracula&quot; (the only &quot;reggae&quot; song that i like), &quot;12D3&quot; and the &quot;Latin Simone&quot; singed by 2D....<br />     I´m sure that -at less- 3 songs will be on your stereo constantly....
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I also was blown away by the film.  The song segues throughout the film were breathtakingly brilliant.  It's a shame that whoever built this album did not think it could stand on its own, hopefully it will be released as intended.    The break between I'll Fly away, and Christian's response is unforgivable.  How can a film have such heartstopping musical momentum, and not allow it on the CD?  For a good example of hearing the movie through the music, check out the soundtrack for GIGI.  It has the words before the songs, they're in the right order, and sung by the principals, just like this soundtrack should have been.
B000005IU2|5.0|In response to Tylan's post below, no, indeed the Stooges were not a &quot;punk&quot; band and couldn't really have been a &quot;punk&quot; band in the way that Black Flag or the Dead Kennedys (oh, and Tylan please for God's sake learn how to spell before attempting to write a review on amazon.com) are clearly modern punk bands of and following the true era of punk rock.  What the VH1 special and your pals are trying to tell you is that Iggy and the Stooges were directly INFLUENTIAL on rock music, later punk, grunge, and I could go on about that but there's no point whatsoever in doing so.  Without the Stooges there may never have been a punk rock, are you with me now?  Punk didn't jump out of nowhere...it had influences like any other form of popular music, and without a doubt the Velvet Underground and Iggy were two of the prime &quot;proto-punk&quot; influences.  But no, The Stooges never a &quot;punk&quot; band and never called themselves a punk band.  Rock and roll...yes.
0345441184|5.0|The Mist of Avalon is probably the best book I have ever read. I found it to be a rich telling of a magnificent story. I recommend this book to anyone. This book opened my eyes and changed my life in so many ways. I thought the story was told in classic Celtic fashion, it was a great story and could be seen as just that but it also had a much deeper level for those who chose to see it. All I can say about his book is that it is magical, you will find as you read it a spell is cast over you. It truely  helped me find my way.
0553277472|1.0|The worst book I have ever read! I had been told how great this book is and felt compelled to read it myself. What a waste of money and time. I would give it &quot;0&quot; stars but this does not allow that option. I don't need 380 pages to explain that madness makes no sense. I got absolutely no meaning from the book. I will never spend another dime on another book written by Robert Pirsig, ever.
0385335482|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Bridget Jones' books, and, to me, this is &quot;Bridget&quot; revisited by another author. The main character, Bridget -- oops, I mean Becky -- gets in funny scrapes, she's got a love interest very similar to the Mark Darcy character, and she's English through-and-through. A real material girl, she also mentions stores and designers that mostly Brits, I suppose, would be familiar with. If you are wishing for a third Bridget diary, here's your fix.
B000002KHH|5.0|I just have one or two things to add.  First is the big one.  The sound quality on this thing is crap.  It's a shame that something so amazing has degenerated into a festival of hiss distortion, and random noises.  I knew not of a remastered version until after I bought the Warner Bros. domestic, and I found myself to be just a little peeved.  <br />Of course, the way around the horrible sound is to buy the remastered disc.  Even though it costs a little extra, it is well worth the cash to be able to enjoy the disc more thouroughly....<br />But, anyways, yes, great disc....just take my advice now, and get it...
1577311523|5.0|If you want to read one book and one book only to change your way of thinking, buy this book.  The principles that Mr. Tolle proposes are so simple and should be intuitive for any sane human being and like many things, we forget and ignore the most obvious.  Most of the book is in a question and answer format.  Some questions are simple and explanations are simple.  Most questions are profound and answers are equally profound.  <br />After reading the entire book, the last question interviewer asks on the last page is probably every one wants to ask Mr. Tolle.  His answer(read the book and only look at the answer after you finished the entire book) is dramatic, succinct and bliss-provoking.  I carry this book in my brief case all the time.  You never know when you need an uplifting message!
B000031XCR|5.0|This CD is absilutly one of Celine's best work on her english albums. My grand-mere bought this all the way cd for me when we went on a trip and i listend to it and i enjoyed the whole  album. My favourite songs are, The Power Of Love*If Walls Could Talk*My Heart Will Go On*To Love You More*That's the way it is* I love all of the rest of the songs too but the ones i listed above are my favourites:) But my total top first favourite song is, If Walls Could Talk! :) Celine also has been my favourite singer for 4 yr's now and she will allways be my favorite singer! So this CD IS A MUST HAVE for Celine Dion musique fans.
B000000OA6|5.0|Innuendo has been my favorite Queen album since it was released. By that time I was a kid yet and actually not a good English-speaker so the lyrics didn't mean much to me - until I dig myself into my dictionary and tried to translate everything. The music was thrilling before the translation and became even more thrilling after it.<br />The best track on this album is Innuendo, I think. It creates a kind of athmosphere you can't escape. The closing lines are simply fantastic (&quot;We'll keep on smiling and whatever will be, will be... we'll keep on trying, till the end of time&quot;). This is the real message of this album. Since Freddy was about to die and he knew that exactly... well, this is amazing. Just like the man himself.<br />Other outstanding songs are I'm Going Slightly Mad, These Are The Days Of Our Lives and of course The Show Must Go On, the other defining track of the album. It is interesting though natural that the two defining tracks give a frame to this album (starts off with Innunendo and ends with The Show Must Go On). <br />These Are The Days Of Our Lives is about childhood and childhood loves, a song which isn't a complex one nevertheless is haunting from the very first listening. It has also some perfect lines (&quot;Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know, the rest of my life's been just a show&quot;). That's the one that I'm listening to nowadays the most. I'm Going Slightly Mad is actually a funny song though it makes you shiver. My favorite lines from the song (&quot;Are they trying to tell you something, you're missing that one final screw, you're simply not in the pink my dear, to be honest you haven't got a clue&quot;). And last but not at all least The Show Must Go On. It is exactly about what you expect it to be. He knew he would die but the show must go on. A reviewer already wrote the best lines of this song, I won't repeat him. Anytime I listen to it it brings tears to my eyes.<br />The rest of the album is also of thebest material Queen has ever made. I won't write about the other songs though all of them are great. This is Queen's best album and if you want to have only one album from them, try this one. It should be in the collection of every music fan.
B000002JPA|5.0|This is truly an incredible album, one of the finest I've ever heard. The songs are very long (most of them over 8 minutes), and the musicianship is off the charts. John Petrucci is one of the best guitarists on the planet. His solos are so fast, it's almost mindboggling. Kevin Moore is like a modern-day Mozart (although I think their new guy, Jordan Rudess, may be even better). Mike Portnoy is an amazing drummer.  I disagree that he's not as good as Jon Bonham or Neil Peart. I haven't heard anything from either of them that can match this. Mike is easily one of the best drummers ever. Not quite as good as the mighty Dave Lombardo (I'm not sure that's even possible), but he's definitely up there. James LaBrie's soaring vocals are great, very emotional. They're kind of a combination of Bruce Dickinson and Geddy Lee. They can be a bit much at times, but they suit the music very well. It's hard to single out one song when every one is amazing, but I guess I'd gravitate toward &quot;Metropolis Part 1&quot;. This is a very epic song, with some searing riffs and rather odd moments. In case there's anyone out there who doesn't know, part 2 is the &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; album, as a whole. I also really like the ferocious &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot; and the gentle piano ballad, &quot;Wait for Sleep&quot;. But, this whole album is amazing. If I had to make one complaint, it'd be the bass. John Myung is probably a great bass player (he'd pretty much have to be to keep up with John and Mike), but you can't really hear him throughout most of the album. There needed to be more bass solos, or just more prominent bass lines. But, that complaint is a minor one. If you like Rush, Queensryche, Boston, Kansas, Yes, Pink Floyd, Metallica, Tool, or Iron Maiden, this is one album you'd be wise to get. I also recommend DT's latest, &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; (which I haven't gotten to yet) and Liquid Tension Experiment, the side project Petrucci and Portnoy did with Jordan Rudess. If you have an appreciation for classical music, but wish it rocked more, this is the band for you.an Rudess. If you have an appreciation for classical music, but wish it rocked more, this is the band for you.
0553278223|2.0|We, an English course at a German Gymnasium, rate the book, The Martian Chronicles, a two because the structure of the book seemed quite confusing to us. Despite this fact we all liked the first couple of chapters a whole lot since the idea of settling a foreign planet was shown in an exciting way. After reading half through the book most of us put it away because from now on the stories got boring... Most of us found the effort of reading 308 pages a waste of time!
1558216847|5.0|Slavomir Rawicz was a young cavalry officer in the Polish Army at the outbreak of WWII.  After Poland was divided among the Germans and Soviets, Rawicz was arrested and sentenced to hard labor in the Siberian gulag.  The tales of the terrible journey to get to the gulag are epic in their own right.  The overcrowded cattle car the Poles rode in (those in the center suffocated; those on the outside froze to death; all died standing up because they were packed in like sardines); being hitched to reindeer and dragged through a raging blizzard, where men who dropped were shot or left to die in the snow; then they had to build the camp once they arrived.  Rawicz and some of his fellow prisoners, which include a mysterious American named Mr. Smith, decide to escape come summer.  They develop an incredible plan to walk to British India.  Once the time is right, they sneak out of the camp and begin a journey over thousands of miles.  They encounter no real problems in Siberia, even picking up a runaway girl, but once they enter Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, it's a different story.  They have no food, water, or map, and no knowledge of desert survival. They run across NO human beings during this time.  They enter Tibet and find people, seemingly the friendliest people on earth despite the language barrier, and eventually cross the Himalayas, fighting cold, bottomless crevasses, and even a Yeti! (the most doubtful part of the book; this incident is also described as fact in Bernard Heuvelman's 'On the Track of Unknown Animals', the cryptozoology bible).   True or not, this is all-in-all a great adventure read.  I passed it around, and everyone I gave it to liked it.

0385335482|4.0|This is the first novel by Sophie Kinsella that I've ever read, and it certainly won't be the last. If you enjoy author Marian Keyes, then this book will definetly be an enjoyable read. It was almost scary how much I had in common with Rebecca, and I coudln't help laughing because I know we've all been in her shoes at some point. Very entertaining and nicely written.
B00000J7J4|5.0|...great despite the fact that it's a hit. I don't think Carlos Santana is capable of putting together a lousy album (worst case scenario from this man is &quot;damn good&quot;), and I bought this one in that spirit. Then I started hearing a lot of media hype about a breakthough of Latino presence in the entertainment world--what with J-Lo, Christina, Ricky and Marc--that this album is a milestone effort to that issue. And it struck me that I've been listening to this man's music for over thirty years without really giving a damn about his ethnicity. What a shame that so many listeners bought &quot;Supernatural&quot; consistent with that old Tom Petty line; &quot;...fer all thuh raw-hong reasons&quot;. Me, I bought it for the exact right reason--to hear one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived play.
0064471837|5.0|This turned out to be a great book.  The beginning started off a little slow, but a friend urged me to continue reading.  I did and I'm so glad!  Sabriel had a unique personality along with her helpful, but smug friend Mogget.  This book has a lot of everything for people with different tastes: adventure, magic, an interesting world, and of course romance.  This was the first book I've read by Garth Nix, but it certainly won't be my last!

B00005B4GU|5.0|I finally experienced for myself the place where the cover art for Kid A must have been photographed. Amnesiac took me there. Kid A was only an intoduction for this incredibly deep and emotionally explicit album. The first track serves as an excellent &quot;from Kid A&quot; transition tune to get you into the new and more mature feel of Amnesiac. If you owuld know me you would know hard hard it is for me to give an album 5 stars. This one brings itself more of a 5.5. Great work form the band. They ARE finally making the music they've always wanted to make. Let them only bring us more!  ^_^ VERY RECOMMENDED!
0471381985|5.0|Value Investing begins with a very readable and well thought out discussion of the value investing approach and then moves on to provide insight from some of the industry's most admired and accomplished practitioners.  A very practical discussion that I consider one of the best books on the subject.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning how some great investors continue to generate consistent returns year after year, and also to professionals who will find a great discourse that they will want to have in their library.
B000003S09|5.0|I'm really replying to the review by Nick Karn. During their career, Crimson often made - and occasionally recorded - long jams.  Some of these canoodle. They wander from place to place in a rather aimless way. The difference between this and minimalism is structure.  Now, from the perspective of the '00's, we can understand just how forward looking that long jam was.  A large quiet space with a few sounds dropped in it, to savor, to allow us to recover from intensity. New-age music has made us used to very quiet and spacious tracks. But many modern ambient pieces just seem to wander: whereas the best have structure, as those doodles that Fripp or Klaus Schultz chose to put on record have structure.  In this..small tinkle of bells, this...single slow drumroll, are all the pent-up fury and power of a monumental band.  That is why I love King Crimson.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Snatch is really an excellent, exciting, VERY funny movie.  Alot like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, only better though.  However, is anybody else having problems with the DVD?  None of the deleted scenes will play on mine.  If they are defective, I wonder how we can reach Columbia/Tristar to let them know?  I went to their website, but there is no contact/email there.   :(
B000059XUY|5.0|Poor, abandoned kitten Oliver is homeless on the streets of 1980s New York City, until he meets a streetwise dog named Dodger. The cool canine takes Oliver under his wing and, with the help of the rest of his all-dog pickpocket gang, begins to teach him how to survive on the wrong side of the law. But when one of their con jobs goes awry, Oliver ends up in the hands of a sweet, lonely, little rich girl named Jenny. Suddenly, Oliver is living the high-life in a Fifth Avenue penthouse, much to the chagrin of Jenny's prize-winning, pampered poodle, Georgette. When the old gang shows up to rescue Oliver from his ritzy new life, they're disappointed to find that he wants to stay with Jenny. Their human ringleader, Fagin, however, is more than happy to send Oliver home, if he can get a healthy ransom in the process. Fagin isn't really a bad guy, he's just one step above homeless and has a really nasty loan-shark breathing down his neck. Jenny shows up on the dark and dangerous docks to pay Oliver's ransom and rescue her little kitty, and her sadness is too much for Fagin to take, but loan-shark Sykes has no troubles from a conscience and sees a chance to make even more dirty money. He snatches up Jenny and plans to hold HER for ransom! Suddenly, Oliver, Dodger, Fagin and the gang find themselves on a desperate rescue mission to save Jenny from the ruthless Sykes and his bloodthirsty Doberman Pinschers, Roscoe and Desoto, and even Georgette is getting in on the heroic action!     There's no doubt about it, Disney's wonderfully charming classic \\"Oliver and Company\\" is one of the most dated animated films you'll ever see. Of course, that's a big part of its charm. What could be more \\"`80s\\" than 1980s New York City? How about the music of Billy Joel and Huey Lewis? I know they were two favorites of mine in the `80s! Okay, to be honest, Billy Joel and Huey Lewis aside, the `80s is something you look back on and mock rather than view fondly, especially the clothes, and Oliver and Company captures that aspect, along with many others, perfectly. So, it's dated. Everything is, really. Call it nostalgia. Anywho, as strongly `80s as \\"Oliver and Company\\" is, it rises above it! It is simply a great film! That's something that's easy to forget if you haven't seen it in a while. \\"Oliver and Company\\" is Disney's twist on Charles Dickens' \\"Oliver Twist,\\" and it is an EXCELLENT modernization! All the best characters are there, and the cast is star-studded! The piano man himself, Billy Joel, voices the artful Dodger, a canine so cool he puts Snoopy to shame (we still love ya, Snoopy)! The hilarious Cheech Marin is Tito the Chihuahua, animation alumnus Dom Deluise is Fagin, the divine Bette Midler is one of Disney's funniest characters as Georgette, Robert Loggia is the excellently slimy villain, Sykes, and a very young Joey Lawrence plays Oliver, just to name a few! With seamlessly incorporated computer animation and painstakingly acquired \\"dog's eye view\\" shots of New York City, \\"Oliver and Company\\" was the film that kicked off Disney's big comeback as an animation heavyweight, though this cute little film was easily forgotten in the wake of Disney's mega-hit, \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" the following year. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the magic of \\"Oliver and Company\\" yourself! Even the soundtrack is terrific, despite that it is powerfully \\"80s.\\" And, it's amazing how well Disney has translated \\"Oliver Twist\\" into a tale about cats and dogs on the streets of New York without losing the heart of the tale and its underlying messages. The DVD is fantastic as well, especially for a single-disc Disney release! This is the way DVDs should be! In addition to the widescreen presentation of the film, you get a behind the scenes featurette from the original theatrical release, 2 shorter featurettes, a TV spot, theatrical trailers, a scrapbook gallery of art and other materials, 2 sing-along-songs, and the best part: You get two classic Disney shorts! Included as extras are \\"Puss Cafe,\\" a hilarious Pluto cartoon where the pup goes up against two troublesome felines invading his backyard, and \\"Lend a Paw,\\" the Oscar winning Mickey Mouse short in which Pluto saves a kitten from drowning and quickly regrets it. Outstanding stuff, and an amazing selection of extras for a single-disc Disney DVD! Rediscover this Disney Classic on DVD today! You won't regret it!
B00004Z459|1.0|My title says it all.  This thing sucks.  These guys have nothing new to offer, very uninovative yelling and chords.
0812548094|5.0|I have read all 6 books of the Sword of Truth series, I guess I had to wait 2 years to write these reviews because I was way too young and ignorant 2 years ago to write anything even resembling philosophy. I will now state some of the things I have seen and think are worth writing about. Feel free to skip sections if you want.<br />What is the worth of a friend anyway. Are they to be used as tools for the greater glory of the main character, or are they sidekicks, meant to support and do 1/2 but recieve 1/20 of the reward. Planescape Torment put it best when it stated do they \\"matter\\" to you? Are they the kind of friends that stick by you through hell and heaven? Khalan in Wizard's First Rule has never had a friend. Ever since she was a child she has faced adult responsibilities and others fearing her power. Personally I would love to have someone touch a person and make him tell the truth, that would pretty much eliminate death sentences and mistakes. If you were guilty why let her destroy you since you'll just tell it all? But I would also fear that which I would not understand and its abuse. Search Kahlan's personality and ethics and see if she abuses her power. There are lesser people all around that if they had this power, they would be corrupted by it.<br />When she says you are special Richard, and when Richard says that is what friends do... Its a subtle communication and teaching. It means more to people that really appreciate it. It is teaching that there is more to life than just \\"duty\\" to the people.<br />Next on the agenda is magic, how I love how magic is explained in this book and the series in general. Richard learns what is magic but not how to work specific aspecs of magic, mainly his magic. The Sisters of Light(AKA 50% Aes Sedai, 50% religious fanatics) said every wizard/sorcerous uses the gift differently... mm that sounds like telepathy and telekinesis to me. Additive magic adds and multipies what is there, but subtractive magic obliterates things. [...]Rather I just look at how Zedd uses magic. Floating things, making dense air sharper than a scalpel. Making fire that is alive. Too bad he's not powerful enough to raise rocks out of the ground and impale people. Although the tearing of the ground is just a waste.<br />Zedd worked up a great conundrum when he said the murderer justifies his killing because he believes he is right in book 1. Lol, but zedd also talked of Righteous anger and justification to Richard. So who is right and who is wrong if it is all only on perspective. Well there are 4 truths, your truth, his truth, the guy that saw it's truth, and the Real truth. Reality is so complicated its ridiculous.<br />The Six Wizard's Rules have improved my life by adding a touch of wisdom to a rather dull mind. It made me think about my actions, who governed them, and if they were right or not. Faith is all good and nice but I'd rather search for it then have it handed to me. I always did like philosophy and ethics.<br />I agree with some when they said there were several irregularities in Robert Jordan's works. To understand Goodkind's strong points, you must understand Robert Jordan's works. I don't think all the similarities between the two is by coincidence, yet a zirconium and diamond is similar in appearances, only when you go deeper is where you see the divergeance. Aes Sedai can't lie, but are they better for that or do they just adapt into a more subtle form of lying. Sisters of Light don't believe in lieing but they would do it by justifying it that it saves lives. Originally both were good, Sedai served the world, Sisters served the wizards that would otherwise have died. Now they are both corrupt, aes sedai trying to dominate the lives that they were Sworn to protect. Aes sedai would eviscerate any male that so much as insulted them. Abuse of power. Sisters of Light train and brainwash wizards so they can be controlled. Causing more harm than good. Aes Sedai is both male and female. Yet thefemales has so much scorn for the males that if I didn't know better I would think we had a gender switch. Circa 1500s when everyone thought females were stupid as cows.<br />Book 2 is an excellent sequel to Book 1. It begins the moment Richard and Kahlan leaves which is suprisingly enough. But the danger manifests itself very quickly as the People's Palace is attacked by the Keeper's minions. Richard has torn the veil, and now has to fix it. But his gift is going awry so he has to go and get helped. Whether that help is good or bad is your guess. In the end, you'll see that dragon, know what the Stone of Tears is, see the palace again, and get rid of that collar!
B00000DGUG|5.0|Maybe a few people think im pusing it by saying that but this is the only album that i havent got fed up of after hundreds of listens.   I to disliked this album when i first heard it, but i gave it a chance and wow, it really changed me. here is my veiw on the album song by song:  FRONT ROW: The first time i heard this song i was overwhelmed by the amount of words but i loved the chorus and still do. its a very affective song much better than the j.l.p opener &quot;all i really want&quot; its soo upbeat and fun to sing with... 5/5  BABA: i love this song, the guitar riffs and the intro rock, the lyrics are very controlled, moking all these insincere twats that go to find themselves!?! 5/5  THANK U: To be honest i dont like this song, the live version is much better,as its a great sing-a-long song and i do like the lyrics. i think if this song had not been released as the first single the album wouldve sold many more copies. 2/5  ARE YOU STILL MAD: This song is only average, but the more versions i listen to the more i like it, the end verse is really cool. everytime i listen to it i hear a new instrument or effect on it and that i love. 4/5  SYMPATHETIC CHARICTOR: I love the way the lyrics work in this song. Its very very dark and requires a lot of attention to get used to it, but i can see what alanis tries to accomplish in this song, and i think she did. 4/5  THAT I WOULD BE GOOD: This is the first and last relaxed slow song on the album. its so nice and melodic and the lyrics are excellant. its one of those moving songs that really hits you when your hurt. 5/5  THE COUCH: I love this song, its really unique it starts and just gets harder and faster and heavier each verse, and it fairly melodic also. 5/5  CANT NOT: This is another very dark song that is easy to relate to. The sound quality in this song and the way alanis' voice sings is very different to everything else. i love when mid song the grunge stops and it goes peaceful then trashy again it rocks. 4/5UR: This is the first song i really liked. The first verse is excellant but looses its originalty after a while. its very jagged little pillish, but its not the best. 3/5   I WAS HOPING: this song is flawless. everytime its listend to it gets better and better, i found it very dark at first but the tune is excellant and lyrics too 5/5   ONE: This is a good song, i love the chorus, its also very melodic and alnis sounds great, live i think it sounds as it was supposed too adn is much better. 4/5   WOULD NOT COME: The beat in this song is soo cool adn you just cant help but jump around to it, once again it sounds excellant live but even album is good, the lyrics are excellant, they are so autobiographical. 5/5   UNSENT: this is very original, the phrase plan of the music and the lyrics. its a nice chill out song and the accoustic sound is refeshing. 4/5   SO PURE: God i love this song, its soo upbeat and punky. it was an excellant single and deserved to do much better. 5/5   JOINING YOU: This is probebly my favourite song of all time, it rocks beyond belief and the chorus is really cool. 5/5   HEART OF THE HOUSE: This song has a nice tune but is a bit all over the place as the drums are fast and the piano is slow, it is unlike anything alanis ever did, but im not to pushed on this song 3/5   YOUR CONGRADULATIONS: theres something about the last verse on this song that sums up the whole song its also very different to anything ive heard on such an album, but it brings the album to a close nicely 3/5   (ununvited.(on some versions) this is an excellant song, its just flawless altough just a demo, it still sounds as hauntining 5/5)           i rest my case!?!?!??!
1587880490|4.0|Many critics view Morrie Schwartz's insights as tired or empty clichs.  Their dismissal reminded me of something C.S. Lewis once wrote, \\"Really great moral teachers never do introduce new moralities: it is quacks and cranks who do that...The real job of every moral teacher is to keep on bringing us back, time after time, to the old simple principles which we are all so anxious not to see...\\" Morrie's suggestions are timeless, which is why I accept them.
B000002KLZ|5.0|without a doubt one of the BEST rock bands alive. I bought the vinyl years ago and recently bought the CD. All the songs are performed excellent. Favorites are: Sara, Never going back again, Over &amp; Over, Rhiannon, Go your own way, I am so afraid, Fireflies and Landslide, which in my opinion is one of the most emotional performances Stevie has done ever, you can listen to the depth and the emotions in every whisper and words from her voice, truly amazing.
6301095294|5.0|This is probably the oddest film ever created But on the 3rd or 4th time veiwing it,it slowly becomes your FAVORITE beatles film.(especially if your favorite Beatles year is 1967).
B000003BF4|5.0|The Stones gained a kind of mystique' that put them in a cult status during their '69 tour culminating at Altamont. I know because I was 15 at the time living in Seoul, Korea as an Air Force dependent and it was hard to ignore GYYYO with all the groupies playing it on the bus on the way to SHS in the fall of 1970.  That's when I really fell for the Stones, I could see their influence all the way on the other side of the planet. I did not see the same kind of cult status for the Beatles or Led Zep or Pink Floyd at the time, there was definately something different about the Stones' cult. It's hard to explain that to people today because all they see are the worn out guys who make up the band today. It's really a cart-before-the-horse situation when the gen-X'ers say the Stones never really were that great or sounded that great. Well, the heights that bands reach today had the path paved by groups like the Stones, &quot;stepping Stones&quot; so-to-speak.  GYYYO and GIMME SHELTER gives a glimmer of what it was all about back then. Definately check them out even if you aren't a Stones fan (odds are: like them or not, you've heard of them). Something got lost when Mick Taylor left the band and Ron Wood replaced him in the 70's, they were never the same. It's this version of the Stones that genX'ers know best, who were really a different band and reached new heights. But during the GYYYO days, I think it was the polish of Mick Taylor's guitar from the JOHN MAYALL'S BLUESBREAKERS &quot;school&quot;. Not to say that GYYYO is polished by any means, but when Taylor played with the Stones, to me they reached their greatest heights. With him they were more than just another rock'n roll band in the studio, and on stage you got something like GET YER YA YA'S OUT (GYYYO). It's too bad that in the GIMME SHELTER re-master, there were only a few close-ups of Taylor because he was not ever given the credit due to him (well... it's hard to get the camera off Jagger, isn't it?). He brought the blues to the Stones, a lot more depth and briefly got them away from their Chuck-Berry-type rock'n roll one dimensional style.  To me, one of the most beautiful studio albums of all time is STICKY FINGERS, it ranks up there with DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, LED ZEPPELIN I and ABBEY ROAD. One of the greatest live albums ever is GYYYO. GYYYO and GIMME SHELTER go together. I just wish they had a film version of GYYYO because GIMME SHELTER was such a downer (why in the world did they pay the Hell's Angels 500 bucks worth of beer to &quot;guard&quot; the stage????), but regardless, both are fascinating as they stand.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Ever since I heard about Moulin Rouge, I couldn't wait for it to come out and to go see it. I loved it so much that my friends and I hightailed it to the music store right after the movie to get the soundtrack. Although initially disappointed that it was missing a lot of the great songs and amazing music from the movie, it really does grow on you. I have not been able to stop listening to it - and it's been over a month! It's such a great mix of songs and both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are fantastic! Among several high points are Ewan's rendition of &quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;Come What May&quot; and the haunting remix of the Police's &quot;Roxanne&quot;. Even &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; (which was never one of my favorite songs) is listenable when in the right mood. I have no doubt that a second Moulin Rouge cd will be released in the future with the rest of the music that's missing from the first one...the only question is *when*?!?! In any case, the first cd and watching the movie will just have to do until it does... :)
B00002DEIX|5.0|One of the things that are particularly frustrating to me is how people will not open up their minds and listen to different kinds of music. The masses of people only seem to like what is heard on MTV, which is hip-hop, pop and rock. I'm not saying that there's anything bad about those genres, but people are neglecting JAZZ! When you talk about classical music, I think Jazz should be included in that definition. And anyone wanting to get a taste of what it is, should listen to this CD! It was a phenomenal effort by Joshua Redman and his quartet on this CD! My two favorites... &quot;Courage&quot; and &quot;Leap of faith&quot; kind of remind me of the greatness once displayed by many Jazz musicians in the 1950's. Although, I must admit.... It took a class in College for me to appreciate Jazz because I never really gave it a second thought.. I wished someone would have let me listen to this stuff prior to that, so it would've been a part of my life! Joshua Redman displays a great range on the sax and Gregory Hutchinson does a good job as well on the drums. This is a CD that will please almost anyone's ears, if they give it a chance!
B000002BE9|5.0|Tidal is a poweful, passionate, poetic piece of work, from a woman whose art, voice, and personality would seem to possess all of the aforementioned qualities as well.<br />From the first track, Sleep to Dream, Fiona grabs you with her strong vocals, both in their performance and their lyrics. Fiona effortlessly transitions from such passionately angry pieces as Sleep to Dream to quieter, piano-centered pieces like Sullen Girl, giving us, through voice and lyric, a musical journey through the range of emotions that make up the ebb-and-flow of a young woman's journey through romantic life (that ebb-and-flow being the inspiration of the album's name, Tidal.)<br />Other notable pieces are of course the quite famous Criminal, with its jazzy, self-impugning look at romantic sin; The First Taste, combining a dance beat with all of Fiona's subtle lyrical poeticism, and the perhaps underappreciated Never is a Promise, a breathtakingly beautiful, melancholy song about the limits to which one can communicate one's essence, even to those one most deeply cares about.<br />Fiona sings with a maturity, her lyrics reveal a depth, her music demonstrates a passion most would say was &quot;beyond her years.&quot; To me, Fiona demonstrates clearly that popular music created by a young person (Fiona was only 18 when this was released), need not sound like the general conception of what popular music created by a young person sounds like (e.g.. the Pop Princess Cabal.) No, this is the beautiful work of a profoundly mature young artist, and it is one that you cannot afford to miss.
6303566448|2.0|Being a fan of horror and zombie films, I checked out Re-Animator with some fairly high expectations, considering the good reviews.  I finished the film feeling sorely disappointed.  Why?  Well, as a horror/comedy, it's not very funny, and it's certainly far from frightening.  Some moments are no doubt quite manically inspired, and Jeffrey Combs delivers a tour-de-force performance, but sadly, the thing that maintains most interest is either Barbara Crampton's nude scenes or the visual effects.  The least this film could have achieved was work as a thrill ride, with some good zombie action, but even at that it's underwhelming.  Either go back to Romero's Living Dead series or check out The Return of the Living Dead as a great example of how to mix horror and comedy.
B000002U82|3.0|Dark Side of the Moon is a very unique album, and a hard one to review. After all, it was extremely influential at the time it was made (1971). Many parts of it are still above and beyond the rest even today. But in many other places, it just falls apart.<br />The main thing about it is that at the time, nothing even close to this was out there. This album has long stretches of ambient noise, lots of very slow, gloomy echoes, freaky sound effects that are very well-placed, and long, self-aggrandizing solos. Most of the reason why it became so popular is probably because it was the only record like it. No other band had an otherworldly combination of blues-rock, psychedelia, jazz elements and gloom quite like Pink Floyd. Okay, a point for originality.<br />Sure, it contains at least two timeless rock songs - &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; (though in my personal opinion, &quot;Us and Them&quot; is better), but the thing is, the good rock songs comprise about half the CD. The rest is complete filler. &quot;On the Run&quot;, for instance, is just a bass/keyboard loop repeated over and over with panting sounds in the background. &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky,&quot; though it has a nice piano tune, also has some soul singer screaming her head off, and while that's well and good for about ten seconds, after that her &quot;AAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAHHHHH!!!&quot; begins to wear quite thin.<br />We see some of David Gilmour's fine guitarwork here, but nothing like the beautiful things he would compose later. In fact, I would say that this album is more a masterpiece of production than one of music and songcraft. It's flawlessly produced, with all the aforementioned weird samples, and with one song seamlessly seguing into the next. The music is inconsistent, and words, well, are only present on half the songs. They, of course, contain some of Waters' biting satirical commentary when they're there, but again, nothing like what he would later write.<br />Basically, this is a good place to see Pink Floyd's talents and achievements in embryo, but in and of itself, it's not all it's cracked up to be. That alone makes it more than a curiosity, and it certainly has its fine moments, but it's not great...just good, and interesting.
6302732778|5.0|Honestly, your perception of the movie depends on which version you view. I, wanting to see the film, purchased the VHS Director's Cut version recently. To say the very least, I was impressed. Scott's dystopian vision of future Los Angeles would have George Orwell standing up and clapping in applause. If you are watching the director's cut, pay special attention to the unicorn dream sequence, and Gaff's origami figures. However, if you are watching the original (which I prefer), Ford's voiceover (while monotone) explains crucial details to the plot.
B00005JHAB|5.0|I LOVED this movie!  At first it seems like it is going to be just another predictable ending, but several events come up that leave you worried that things may not end up how you might want them to.  I can't wait to get a copy of this movie so I can watch it again!  I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cute movie.
0440133688|3.0|I am a physician who completed a residency in Psychiatry. We had to do four months of medicine in our first year. The book is incredibly accurate with regard to the anxieties and fears that an intern has. These are too numerous to mention here. I'll probably never read the book again as those memories are too painful and I never want to go through that cruelty again. Being an intern means losing yourself; your patients become your life. I only gave it three stars because some parts of the book seem like verbatim copies out of Joseph Heller's Catch 22. Otherwise 5 stars for authenticity.
B00004U2GH|5.0|They don't make 'em like Johnny Cash anymore, and this CD shows exactly why he is and will always be unique.  I challenge you to find a CD more filled with honesty, emotion, spirit and skill.  <br />First of all, the songs are brilliant.  Deceptively simple tales of life and death, each song creates its own world, and the listener cannot help but be drawn in.  By including so many songs about incarceration, justice and redemption, Cash builds a palpable rapport with the inmates at San Quentin.  &quot;Starkville City Jail,&quot; &quot;Fulsome Prison Blues&quot; and &quot;Wanted Man&quot; all look at the lives of the fugitive and the jailed with simple, searing language.  The highlight of the CD, however, must be &quot;San Quentin,&quot; which Cash wrote just days before this performance.  Hearing him sing about the prison he's performing in, and hearing the inmates respond to each line, sends chills down my spine every time I listen.<br />Unlike most live albums, the stories Cash tells between songs never get old.  You really get the chance to see his personality at work as he interacts with the inmates, makes fun of the guards and shares personal stories.  Even for the non-country music fan (like me), this is a must-have CD.
0345350499|5.0|I only read this book because a friend of mine encouraged me to read it and I am so glad I did. I never have been interested in science fiction or fantasy books, nor have I ever read anything about the legends of King Arthur. But I quickly found that this book has much more substance that just another Arthurian legend. <br />Marion Zimmer Bradley writes beautifully through the eyes of the women behind King Arthur's throne about many dualities such as male power and female power, duty and desire, Christianity as opposed to other religious beliefs, and faith versus pride and ambition.  I found this book very empowering and would recommend it to all of my friends. This will be an all-time favorite book of mine that I plan to read again.
6302043158|5.0|This film deserves to be in the pantheon of classic teen angst films (though it will really speak to adults reflecting on their years more so than it will for teens).  I think it's the best film I've ever seen in that genre (and is based on probably the best album that ever covered such ground).  There is real grit to the film, real emotion and pathos (but also a teriffic sense of humor).  The cast is also outstanding (why Phil Daniels didn't become a big star is anybody's guess).  But add to this the knockout soundtrack (from the \\"Quadrophenia\\" LP and other radio hits of the 60s), and you practically have a perfect film (I'm always hesitant to say anything is truly perfect).  But I wouldn't change anything here.  It is an unqualified success.  <br />It helps to understand the milieu of the film, so read up here on the mods and rockers so that you understand the time and place.  But then hang on for a long, LOUD ride!  This movie just knocks me out!  I wish I had seen it when I was a teenager.  Better late than never!...<br />Don't miss it!  And I will say this movie was much better the second time around (especially at a theatre).  The film is so loaded with atmosphere and cultural references that you can't possibly take it all in in one sitting.
B00003CX8J|4.0|This is a very good film. I hope they make another. Patrick Stewart is what acting is all about. DVD extras are very good.
0316777722|5.0|This book is the perfect mix. A little insight and a lot of laughs. I read this book on a plane and my wife told me I had to stop because people were looking at us. I was laughing so hard people thought I was having some kind of breakdown.
630542828X|5.0|Here is a film that slowly and solidly builds to a rather unsatisfying climax and essentially leaves its audience hanging out to dry or does it? The film's denouement is brilliantly filmed and edited and leaves the viewer left to discover the better part of human nature.  This is a perfect example of post-romantic Hollywood film-making where visuals are not on the screen but are left to the mind's eye and in this case the film's directorial style finally delivers a totally satisfying piece of story telling.<br /><br />Steven Zaillian is a totally underrated director. He directed two other great films SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER and ALL THE KING'S MEN. Just as with A CIVIL ACTION, they are highly underrated and great films. The cast of A CIVIL ACTION is brilliant and includes John Travolta, Robert Duvall, Kathleen Quinlan, Tony Shalhoub, John Lithgow, James Gandolfini, Sydney Pollack and Bruce Norris. This film also has one of Danny Elfman's best scores. I highly recommend A CIVIL ACTION.
B00000K3UU|1.0|This film glamorizes everything that is wrong with our society. Just take one look at the cover. Is that the type of public behavior that you want to teach your children? Skip this for your own sake. Besides, it's not funny even when it tries to be.
B00005LB9O|2.0|I'd call it diet Brit pop. Sing is about as mediocre as you can get. It reminds me of Christian music - riskless and predictable. Travis inspire no one on this album and carry hardly any soul from track one to ten. A thorough listening gave me no reason to go back again and offered no remedy for my post-purchase anxiety. Buy John Lennon's Double Fantasy and save yourself before this abuse of schmaltzy  melodies invades your consciousness.
B0000214F0|1.0|Could have been a great movie if they had gotten a decent director and had not butchered Vidale's script but still pretty good none the less. Shows ancient Rome in all its glory. Probably one of the most realistic potrayals of ancient Rome ever made. The film attains good status based only on the great performances by its principal actors. Now on to the DVD. I bought a copy of this horrible ... only because the cover said Digitally Remastered and Fully Restored. The film quality of this DVD is unbelievably bad. The whole thing is very grainy and there were even parts were I could see scratches in the film and also where it had been repaired. I have movies on VHS tape that put this DVD to shame. I can't say enough about how bad the picture and sound quality of this DVD is. Do not buy a copy of this .... Hopefully someday someone will really fully restore and remaster this film but this one aint it.
0380973650|2.0|This novel has an interesting premise but it is weakly executed. The characters and situations were so boring and uncompelling that I had trouble continuing  with the book at times.Even his prose lacked vitality.The basic structure of new gods challenging old gods is interesting but except for a few intermittently scattered passages the book is awful.
B00003CXN3|1.0|I really had no idea what this movie was about when my husband and I rented it.  I wish I hadn't wasted my time.  I really like Michael Douglas, but this movie is not worthy of his acting ability.  He has made much better movies.  I agree with all of the other reviewers who said this was boring.  It was also depressing.  Very hard to follow and keep up with what with all the bouncing back and forth between stories.  I know that there is a drug problem out there, and I know there was probably supposed to be a hidden message.  It was one of those movies where you have to really think about it.  My husband made a comment about the movie that if he wanted to see that stuff all he has to do is watch the news.  We watch movies to escape, not be reminded of all the depressing stuff in the world.<br />Unless you like this kind of thing, I wouldn't recommend it.
0380730367|4.0|Someone told me to read them in order and I am glad I did. Excellent reading. Dennis has a way with words and characters. The dialogue is dry and great! I can hear the Boston neighborhoods! Loved all the characters and especially Bubba who is a hoot! I will have to save &quot;Mystic River&quot; for another time. It's a little too dark for me. But I hear it is great. Congrats, Dennis!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|OK so the first time seeing this the first half hour is a bit hard on the senses. But, I have seen this movie twice now and Baz has done it again. His prior two films, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo & Juliet, are also huge favorites of mine and Moulin Rouge is simply the best movie I have seen this year.<br /> Sure the music seems hokey at first but once you truly listen it actually all makes sense.<br /> Ewan & Nicole amazed me with their singing as well as Nicole's acting talent was much better than some of the other things I've seen. (Far and Away...ich..double ich!)<br /> So please if you like musicals and enjoyed Baz's first two films do not miss this flick and if you haven't seen the other films rent them!<br />
0671034065|3.0|OK, so this is not the Book of Life..but it was great fun to read. The sexual banter (down and dirty)between Sam and Jaine was very funny and not mean spirited. You will laugh out loud. The 4 friends were great and the mystery was easy to solve. Believe me, we would all want a neighbor like Sam!
B00003CX8J|4.0|I don't know why; I usually go to comic book movies expecting something cartooney, I guess.  But although this one is not as good as Superman or Batman (the original of each, of course), it is a great introduction to the X-Men.  It's definitely worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of the movie or the others I mentioned.  It has some pretty good special features.  The Hugh Jackman screen test was cool, and I was scratching my head wondering why a couple of the deleted scenes were not included in the final cut.<br />Now if only they would get off their duffs and get rolling on the sequel.  (Which, I hope, is better than the later Superman and Batman sequels!)
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is a must-see.  The special effects are incredible. The martial arts work is even better! Unlike &quot;Crouching Dragon, Hidden Lion&quot;, where it is obvious that the actors have been placed on wires because of their instability and awkward movement, the actors and actress in the Matrix have mastered the art of flying with wires, and the result is absolutely stunning.  The supplemental DVD shows the rigorous training they went through.  Kudos to the trainers and to the actors and Carrie-Anne Moss for their amazing work on this movie!
B00004Z4WR|4.0|This movie was great.  The cars made the whole movie but the story line was interesting.  Nicholas Cage-Dallas was trying to help his brother Kip steal 50 cars in a limited amount of time.  He is a former car thief gone straight who calls on his friends to help he and his brother complete this order in due time before Kip is exterminated by the bad guy.  This movie is exciting and the fast cars make the action and adventure in this movie one not to pass up.  Buy it!
B00003CX9E|5.0|After seeing this movie for the first time, someone challenged me to summarize it in one sentence.  Here it is.<br />&quot;Citizen Kane lived his life in a futile attempt to secure the love of others; futile not because he was unloved, but because he could not believe that he was loved.&quot;<br />Can a movie change your life?  This one changed mine.
0345409671|4.0|Once again, great book by Anne. (applause)  If you intend to read this book, it is best to read the series from the begining book Interview with the Vampire and work your way to this one.  If you choose not to do that it could hamper your ability to understand what Anne's characters are saying when they speak of certain things.  <br />This book tends to drag a bit when it talks of revelations and the creation of the world but her concept of God and the Devil are very mind boggling.  You find yourself saying &quot;This is only fiction&quot; but also take into account the possibilities of her being right on the money about life in general.  I guess that is why faith must be blind faith through and through.  Anyways this is a must read but don't let the boring stuff bother you the book does pick back up.  Have patience and enjoy.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I love to hear an orchestra and I love a good metal band.  My two favorites have been put together and put together very well.  What other metal band can you think of that could pull this off?  That's right, no one, because their talent is not up to the level as Metallica.  What a wonderful muscial gift and insight this group has.  If you have an appreciation for Mozart and Metallica, you will be in awe with S&amp;M.  This is no doubt my most listened to CDs I have purchased to date.

B00000DHRX|5.0|I'm fan of George Michael ever since he turned out to be gay just like me! I directly bought the single Outside of George Michael. This album is just great! It shows great inspiration and skills from this legend. If you are a pop fan, buy this CD. Thrust me! :)
B00003CXFU|4.0|Excellent movie. Based on a true story, though doubtless with some Hollywood style touch-ups, this is a powerful tale of a bunch of disparate, ordinary individuals, none too aware or confident, fighting against a wealthy corporation that has played havoc with their lives. And the driving force behind this fight is Erin. Julia Roberts plays a scrappy survivor in this movie, loud, foul mouthed, but a fighter all the way. She makes no apologies for her self or her circumstances and manages to rub countless people the wrong way. Down on her luck and nearly out of funds with three kids to support, she bullies a lawyer who let her down into giving her a job (the responsibilities are never clear!). Once at the law office however, she learns in passing of a set of strange events centered around a power company that has been polluting the water supply in a town near its plant, and then suppressing all news of its activities till the statute of limitations can rescue it. Biting in like a bulldog, Erin-Julia hits the ground running, talks to the victims and slowly assembles a case. She has to fight the status quo all the way, be it her own boss (Albert Finney, superb in a well crafted role), his new partner, the power company itself, the legal system and for that matter her personal life. Left behind by her single minded quest, her boyfriend (an unbelievably soft and sensitive Harley Davidson biker!) bails out. But Erin has by now identified so closely with the victims that it has become a personal crusade for her and she cannot throw in the towel. Great characterizations, the emotions are very real and honest. A quality movie that shows America at its best, and at its worst!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Years ago my sister &amp; I used to delight in listening to the radio show Blue Grass Alive on a local college station. It was so different from what the &quot;country&quot; stations played. Much of what they aired was non-commercial, frequently recorded outdoors. Plenty of hiss and distortion was there in the old recordings.<br />Well, this soundtrack sure captures the spirit of what we used to listen to on Saturday nights. Not truckstop country western, but real, honest-to-goodness country music--but recorded with quality. There's a great representation of various &quot;country&quot; styles here, from blues to gospel. It's a refreshing break from listening to the corporate tunes that clog the airwaves these days. I think Mother Maybelle is somewhere smiling ...
6305428298|5.0|Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan McGregor, and Jane Horrocks give absolutely stellar performances in this wonderfully quirky film. The title of the film refers to Jane Horrocks' character who is called \\"Little Voice\\" or LV, for short.<br /><br />LV is a mousy, meek, painfully shy and reclusive little thing with an itty bitty speaking voice. She is totally overwhelmed by her brazen and common mother, Mari (Brenda Blethyn), who treats LV with scarcely concealed contempt. Part of that contempt is fueled by LV's devotion to her late father's memory and her fondness for old time musical stars. She has a collection of records by those long ago stars, that she plays over and over, a collection that she apparently inherited from her beloved father.<br /><br />Her passion for this music drives her mother crazy, as it seems to remind Mari of her late husband, whom she apparently held in the same regard in which she holds LV. Only Billy (Ewan MCGregor), the local telephone repairman, a sensitive, young man who trains and raises pigeons as a hobby, seems to talk to LV as if she were a sentient being.<br /><br />Mari begins dating Ray Say (Michael Caine), an over the hill, has been talent scout. Mari is pathetic, as she tries desperately to hang on to whatever vestiges of her youth remain. Ray, a sleazy opportunist, who thinks that he is God's gift to women, does not exactly reciprocate Mari's lavish affections. I cannot, however, think of two people who deserve each other more.<br /><br />One day, LV is in her room singing, and Ray overhears her, but what he hears is \\"Judy Garland\\". It seems that LV can sing and sound exactly like those old time musical stars. Ray is in seventh heaven with his discovery. You can almost see the dollar signs in his eyes. He will do whatever it takes to get LV on stage, though his unctiousness towards her only serves to fuel Mari's jealousy of Ray's attention to her daughter.<br /><br />Ultimately, Mari and Ray band together, however, as LV is their meal ticket to fame and fortune, if they can only get her to overcome her shyness and reclusiveness. They do not, however, understand why she sings. It is this lack of perception that that will, in the end, be their undoing.<br /><br />Nonetheless, LV goes on to give one of the most show stopping performances ever to grace center stage. The transformation is incredible. Jane Horrocks gives a performance to be remembered! The only question is whether Ray and Mari can get LV to sing more than once. See the movie and find out for yourself. This is, without a doubt, an exceptional film.their meal ticket to fame and fortune, if they can only get her to overcome her shyness and reclusiveness.

B00005B4GU|4.0|'amnesiac', like 'kid a', has recieved mixed reviews both editorially and from fans. i believe it is another triumph for radiohead. the main arguement against this album is that it is a pale attempt to &quot;break new ground&quot; in the genre of electronic music. it is not, when viewed in this light, groundbreaking in any sense. its very raw, sometimes appears to stumble and seems a little skitzophrenic. the two obvious &quot;singles&quot; on this album are 'pyramid song' (track 2) and 'i might be wrong' (track 5). 'pyramid song' is hauntingly beautiful, with simple, eloquent piano and thom yorke's beautiful voice dominating the first half, and the rest of the band joining in later on. 'i might be wrong' is a little more fast paced, and dare i say catchey; a story about a relationship thats lost something, thom's poetic lyrics catch the rushed mood of desperation. aside from the two above mentioned songs, there is a sort of odd mix of music on this cd, its very different from anything else i have ever heard, which is what makes it a radiohead album. a few songs have drawn allot of heat, but i think the critics have missed the point. &quot;pulk/pull revolving doors&quot; (track 3) has drawn allot of heat, because, musically speaking, its horrible. the song has a very rushed and scratchey drum beat, and thats about all. thom yorke rants on about all the different types of doors that exist (barn doors, revolving doors, etc), with such a distorted voice that its hard to understand what he's saying. this song is, to me, about modern life, the rush, the confusion, etc... the simplistic, scratchy, very quick beat and thoms distorted voice portray this well... different types of doors equal different opportunities, different choices, but all leading to the inevitable, as thom puts it &quot;trap doors, that you can never come back from&quot; which is, death, of course. at this point the tempo of the song increased exponentially for several seconds, a mad rush, and just whenyou think its all going to explode, it just dies away, and the song ends... i think its great. &quot;like spinning plates&quot;(track 10) has also been criticized for its lack of musical athstetics, the song is so great i cant stand it. the lyrics lead me to believe this song is about social justice, and the wide social gaps in the world in which we live. the beat matches the title: essentially electronic sounds, repetative and with a &quot;revolving&quot; sound to them, like a turntable; very sullen, with deep and gloomy organ in the background. thoms voice is again distorted, he sounds half drunk, opening the song with the words &quot;while you make pretty speeches, i'm being cut to shreds&quot; the sound of the song (spinning) and the title spinning plates so acurately portray the unstable nature of the lives of the exploited, i.e.: spinning plates always tumble. there are more songs on the cd than i have described, these particular ones i just felt deserved mention, and defense. i want to stress that this is my OWN PERSONAL INTERPRETATION of these songs, i cant say for sure what radiohead was trying to say, its just what i think. if you buy this album, listen to it on headphones if possible, it sounds much better. this album is hard to swallow, buts its well worth it if you can.
B000023VR9|3.0|I really wanted to give this CD four stars, but I couldn't find enough good songs. I gave it three stars because I absolutely love the Next Episode! I practically worship the song, and the clean version can be listened to in public. I like Still DRE and Forgot About Dre too, so those are very good raps! But once you get bored of just those two songs, you get sick of the CD! I can't ever get sick of the Next Episode! But this CD is not worth the buy for me because I already have the Next Episode on a compilation CD. But if you don't have any songs on other CDs this is a good buy, not great. The price is a bit expensive though for its worth if you are trying to save.
B00003CXRM|1.0|This flick was, overall, disappointing.  Contained too few funny parts and was, many times, slow moving.
0743201140|5.0|Now, Discover Your Strengths is a provacative and extremely practical book with a gem of an on-line survey instrument.  Do you want to know your strengths?  This is a book + survey instrument that will help you.  Well worth the investment.  <br />One of the big nuggets of value in this book is the amount of research that Gallup conducted to back up the on-line strength surveying mechanism.  <br />The survey is uniquely focused on identifying your strengths.  This is not a test like Myers Briggs (that focuses more on personality traits).  The test takes 30-40 minutes on-line and the results are tabulated instantly with summary and full-text interpretation reports.  Your customized report is printable or viewable (at a later date) on-line.  (You must purchase the book to get the secret password to take the test.)  <br />I asked for an additional code for a family member to be able to take the test and the on-line customer service rep agreed and sent me a new code within a couple hours - very courteous.  I imagine that the survey will be available without the book at some point, but the book adds important information that helps readers understand other people.<br />The authors are credible and the Gallup organization adds deep practical underpinning.  This book will appeal to the pragmatic reader.  Educators and theorists will appreciate the inclusion of the appendix/technical report describing the testing theory and apparatus.<br />The book is not focused so much on the application of talents as it is the discovery of talents.  The author chose not to draw a stronger correlation between strengths and possible career fit. (Richard Bolles does a great job with career matching in his books:  What Color is Your Parachute and The Three Boxes of Life.)<br />In closing: the survey very accurately identified and articulated my key strengths.  It probably will help you, too.
B000059HCI|5.0|This is one of the best movies Ive ever seen. It is also one of the most depressing.  At the end of this movie you are left so inconsolable.  I would definatly sugggest this movie to any one who's on drugs.  Darren aronofsky did a great job filming thiis one. It also has a very very good sound track.
B000001F3C|4.0|This album has just an awesome classic analog tape sound. I wouldn't be surprised if these were recorded live in the studio. 'sunday, bloody sunday' and 'new years day' are my two favorites but this is an ALBUM in the true sense of the word. its a well rounded collection of songs the flow together well and have a certain relativity to one another. All in all, an excellent record from a young angry band who were speaking out about the things going on in the world and the solution we should all strive for.
0140177396|1.0|this book may be easy to study for english literature, being short. However, this story is not interesting in the least, with a plot that builds up and then is thrown away totally at the end.
B00005LB9O|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time.  I've been listening to it for 3 strait weeks without taking it out of my cd player.  Travis is a band that you simply won't get tired of and that's hard to find.  The acustics on this album are simply wonderful.  The bonus tracks get you into a groovin mood.  This cd is a must for your collection.
B000056VIY|5.0|When Jennifer Lopez released On The 6, it certainly proved that she is more than just a pretty face.  Her blend of R&amp;B, pop, and latin music, fused well together and created a truly genuine debut.  Now she's back.  With J-Lo, Lopez takes it a step further and creates another truly enjoyable album, packed with latin soul.<br />1) LOVE DON'T COST A THING - I'm sure everyone has already heard this.  First released single with a thumping R&amp;B beat and addictive chorus.<br />2) I'M REAL - Her latest release.  Has a cute Janet Jackson-like feel to it, and although the chorus maybe hangs on for 1 or 2 sets longer, it will have you jumping around in no time.  &quot;I'm Real, what you get is what you see.....&quot;<br />3) PLAY - I'm sure most of us have heard this too.  Funky club dance music with a hooky chorus.  Only problem is the unnecessary use of the F word in the middle breakdown, still a top song.<br />4) WALKING ON SUNSHINE - This is certainly a different sound for Lopez.  Has a club-techno feel to it, that i'm not always fond of, but here it works.  Positive and fun lyrics.<br />5) AIN'T IT FUNNY - This mexican style single will be what her international fans recieve, around the time of &quot;I'm Real&quot;'s release.  With it's cute chorus and zorro style feel, this is an absolute gem.<br />6) CARINO - A step up from track 5, this is more a contemporary latin song.  Fun paced and Lopez sounds like she was having alot of fun with this one.  The chorus has a bit of a Gypsy King feel.  Another winner.<br />7) COME OVER - First of the two ballads on this album.  Very sexy lyrics, over a strumming flamenco guitar.<br />8) WE GOTTA TALK - Picking up the pace again, with this latin blended R&amp;B dance tune, that will immediately catch you with it's addictive chorus.  &quot;Oooh, baby come and talk to me.......&quot;<br />9) THAT'S NOT ME - Another fast paced R&amp;B tune.  Fast beat, verses and chorus make this an exhausting and funky ride.  In some parts has alittle bit of a PINK (the artist) feel. Hot Hot Hot!!!!<br />10) DANCE WITH ME - Another blend of R&amp;B and latin, for this seductive dancefloor bound midtempo tune.  A little slower than some may expect, but upbeat enough to get you moving, the blazing trumpets over a thumping beat, make this irresistible.<br />11) SECRETLY - Last of the ballads.  In this sultry, late night love song, Lopez handclicks over a moody piano run.  Her voice is seductive in this breathy tune.<br />12) I'M GONNA BE ALRIGHT - Getting back into funky upbeat territory with this R&amp;B laced tune.<br />13) THAT'S THE WAY - Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins wrote and produced this funky upbeat addictive track.  Chorus is fast paced, whilst Lopez's voice is a mixture of sugar and spice.  And yes it carries the &quot;Darkchild&quot; trademark.  A must to listen to.<br />14) DAME - Duetting with latin popstar Chayanne, this is far more enjoyable and upbeat then her previous duet &quot;No Me Ames&quot; with Marc Anthony (Found on On The 6).  Upbeat, fun and the spanish lyrics are a joy to listen to.<br />15) SE YA SE ACABO - Lopez goes all spanish language to close off J-Lo, with this sexy dance tune, laced with blazing trumpets and a spicy spanish guitar.<br />Jennifer Lopez has struck gold with this album and I suggest you seek out both Lopez offerings.  If you like this material also look for Janet Jackson, Gloria Estefan or Christina Aguilera perhaps.
B00005B36H|5.0|Incredible rhythym, signature guitar work, and of course Maynard's fantastic voice lure the listener in with Tool's most melodic album to date. They work their magic, leading the listener into a false sense of security before sublimely pummelling him with the sound that's made Tool the masters of all things metal and beyond. These talented artists will surely receive the accolades they've long deserved with Lateralus. It's intelligent music for people who just aren't satisfied with the typical radio sound.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I like this cd even after all these years,due to the fact that it still can convey the emotion here. And it is still very very good too.
B000002H33|5.0|This is probably the best metal album ever.  I have listened to this cd a few hundred times, and I'm still not tired of it.  Battery and Master of Puppets are two of the top 10 best metal songs of all time, and Master has one of the Best solos.  It's too bad that they suck so much now.
B00000JHAU|4.0|I'll tell you why these songs sound so familiar...&quot;Seeing Other People&quot; has a Charlie Brown cartoon riff, &quot;Me and the Major&quot; might as well be the Housemartins &quot;Me and the Farmer,&quot; &quot;The Fox in the Snow&quot; is definitely Carpenters, and &quot;If You're Feeling Sinister&quot; is Nick Drake (without a doubt). Hey, I don't mind that songwriters borrow...This is a good listen and challenging to figure out where you've heard before...
0790749998|4.0|I liked this movie... unexpectedly!  I say that because the reviews were so bad, but I wanted to see Jet Li nonetheless.  So starting with low expectations, I was really impressed.<br />OK, let's start out by saying that Jet Li is a terrific athlete and martial artist.  In this flick, some of his stunts are wired but that doesn't take away from him in the least.  All the fight scenes are inventive and crisply executed.  The serious scenes, like the Hong Kong jail and the final fight with Kai, are packed with action and creativity.  The funny scenes, like getting away from the gang of bodyguards and the football game fight, are just the right combination of comedy, parody, and serious moves.  So the fighting is great.  See it for this alone.<br />But two other things stand out, which provide the unexpected pleasure.<br />First, the characters and relationships.  Although the plot is a little muddy (OK other reviewers, maybe it's downright turgid!), it still makes sense and is much better than most martial arts flicks. But the plot allows for excellent character development.  I was surprised at the dialog that exposed the depth of both father-son relationships... the brother-sister relationship... the betrayal by the #2 men... the black vs. Chinese gangs... the subtelties you don't pick up until the second viewing... and many good scenes.  Somebody tried to put together a great script.  They didn't quite suceed, but it's still pretty darn good.<br />Second, the love story just worked.  It was not overdone, and developed slowly and believably during the film.  There's no sex (unfortunately, given how great Aaliyah looks!) but there's still a tenuous initial connection growing into a subtle but effective matching of unlikely bedfellows.  The Romeo and Juliet theme is not overplayed at all... just a realistic story of two people from different camps but with a common perspective.  Hot it's not, but rich it is.<br />Finally (I know this is three, but give me a little Li-way), the overall quality is excellent.  The music, cinematography, motorcyle and car chases, smart &amp; funny gags thrown in, and all the other technical aspects are first rate.  <br />So my friends, see Romeo Must Die if you want a martial arts flick with a little extra kick and emotion!
B000002LK1|2.0|First off, the reason why I gave this album two stars is not because it's a bad album (on the contrary, it's actually a  pretty decent one), but because it isn't anything I haven't heard before.  The BIGGEST problem I had with this album was that Depeche Mode didn't take their music in a new direction when they knew they could have.  There wasn't enough variety in the sound of the album.  They didn't take enough risks; absolutely nothing on this album surprised me or moved me much emotionally.  Simply put, &quot;Violator&quot;, is very generic, and it really bothers me that a previous reviewer hailed it as a  \\"magnum opus\\" (whatever the hell that means).  Anyway...many of the songs seemed empty and hollow emotionally(especially \\"Policy of Truth\\", and \\"Clean\\".  The album doesn't challenge the listener, and it sure doesn't come CLOSE to offering the huge amount of creativity and emotion that their previous albums did (or even later ones such as \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\", and yes, even \\"Ultra\\").  And I know this might shock some DM fans that have trouble with being unbiased and objective with their favorite band, but this is my least favorite DM album (my all-time favorite is &quot;A Broken Frame&quot;, and &quot;Black Celebration&quot; with &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; as a close second).  Basically, it's a somewhat likable albeit mediocre (for Depeche Mode) effort.  I think that most people will (and obviously do) enjoy it, but I expected MUCH MORE from such a talented band.
0671027344|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I read it about a year and half ago and still will read it at least once a month.  So many books for teenagers now eitehr make everything seem perfect or where everything always goes wrong.  This book was very truthful.  I think everyone can relate to the main character of Charlie.  I laughed at some parts in this book and came close to crying at others.  I think this is one the greatest books ever written and everyone should read it.
0790743221|5.0|This was the first movie on my &quot;older film&quot; list to see, and it certainly was the best!  The movie was wonderfully witty and charming and had a fabulous plot.<br />The film is about Philadelphia heiress Tracy Lord (glamorous Katharine Hepburn) preparing for her second marraige to George Kittridge, a man who worked his way to the top.  Although George may be the working class hero, he is described as &quot;below Tracy in mind and spirit.&quot;  Two years earlier, Tracy threw out her first husband, C. K. Dexter Haven (the charming Cary Grant), because of an alcoholic addiction.  Now Dexter wants revenge, and with the help of a blackmail article about Tracy's father, he gets in tabloid reporter Mike Connor (the FABULOUS Jimmy Stewart) and photographer Liz Imbrie (The witty Ruth Hussey) to do a piece on Tracy's wedding.  However, with only a day to the alter, Tracy's happy marraige plans spin out of whirl when its a race to the alter that anyone may win!<br />The highlights of the film I thought, was the comedic scenes.  Tracy's little sister Dinah is hilarious, and several scenes including a drunk Jimmy Stewart and Katharine Hepburn are terribly funny.  Full of memorable one liners (I'm just a photographer, I can't afford to hate anyone!), its the perfect quotable movie.  Sequences are brilliant, and the ending is EXTREMELY hard to predict!  Its romantic, witty, and easy to fall in love with.  I was totally in love with the movie after seeing it the first time.<br />Acting is superb, a wonderful comeback for Katharine Hepburn.  Cary Grant plays his suave sophisticated part better then ever, and Jimmy Stewart is DELIGHTFUL!  With 3 such famous names, its impossible to loose.  Stewart won an Academy Award, and it is well deserved.  The part, with Hepburn in mind, is perfect for her, classy and chic, yet still remaining human and goddess at the same time.  Cary Grant is perfectly matched in the movie with his debonaire looks and mild attitude.  Jimmy is stronglycomedic in a drunk scene, as well as singing us a hilarious rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  Ruth Hussey is just as magnificent as Liz Imbrie, the top of the supporting cast.  Everyone is amazing, and the timing is fabulous.<br />The wonderful thing about this movie is that it is so reminiscent of a time that is gone...where you could see an adult movie without over-violence, sex swearing.  The closest you can get to any of the above is a swift punch to the jaw, &quot;two kisses and a late night swim&quot;, and &quot;dog gone it!&quot;  Its a film the whole family can enjoy, the humor is timeless, and the plot is romanticly funny.<br />A true gem amoung gems, The Philadelphia Story is a wonderful movie with a wonderful cast.  I recommend the film to anyone, especially those who are fans of romantic comedy.  A must see, this is Hollywood in its heyday!
B00004XMTH|5.0|I have seen this video several times and continue to enjoy it and find new things in it each time. The music is great, and dancing is out of this world - the way the dancers can move their bodies is awesome.  It's a happy, upbeat way to spend a couple of hours.  One thing that enhanced my enjoyment is getting a companion book that contains the lyrics so that I could follow along more easily, and going into one of the private websites about Cats that explains the plot (as it is - plot is not a major part of this show) and provides explanations of the various characters.  This video is one I know that I will continue to enjoy time after time.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I've never been able to listen to many punk albums all the way through and say that I honestly enjoyed all the tracks. The only other one besides this would be Rancid's \\"And Out Come the Wolves...\\" but don't compare the two: ATDI bends multiple genres into one, and throughout the entire package only two things stay similar: Cedric's voice and the band's incredible talent.<br><br>Songs like 'Arc Arsenal,' 'Pattern Against User,' and 'One Armed Scissor' are above and beyond most emo songs. Other tracks like 'Invalid Litter Dept.' and 'Enfilade' feature heavy pianos and vocal effects, respectively. Nowadays it has been common for bands to throw in the \\"Believe\\" effect just to sound a little more techno-inspired (namely eve 6). The studio effects on this album are sparse, and most importantly, tasteful. The finished package will affect you in one way or another.<br><br>I think it's important to stress that this isn't music with no point. In this day and age there's a real l!ack of honest, hard-hitting music...but 'Relationship of Command' fits that description perfectly.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is one of those albums that you just sit and listen to and say &quot;My God, these guys were truly amazing&quot;.  Brian Wilson was so far ahead of his time in regards to songwriting.  I don't however recommend this album to everyone.  This album is not &quot;packed&quot; with hits, but it is far better than most anything you would buy today.  If you are looking for a more radio friendly BBalbum, go with the greatest hits Vol. 1. But if you have a little extra cash, but this and see why so many contemporary artists believe that this is one of the best albums ever made.
B00002SSRZ|1.0|Please notice that all the other reviews you see here are for the CD VERSION not  the DTS version. The DTS version was terribly remixed. Apparently, they just took different recorded tracks from the original masters and stuck them to different speakers. If you want to hear a Santana lead guitar from the left rear sorround speaker and ambiance from the center speaker then buy it! If, like me, you wanted to hear this album (the music is great) in a sorround environment with a wider soundstage, realistic acoustics, and a &quot;I'm at the studio&quot; feel you'll be better off with the CD version and save money to boot.<br />I wrote this as fair warning to anyone else seeing so many stars for this product when most were reviewing the CD version and not the DTS version.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I really like this CD, and bought it after my New Yorker friend, Emma, told be about them.  &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; is a great CD with lovely songs.  The first single, &quot;Sing&quot;, is a wonderful track to set the mood for the rest of the album.  I am not too partial to &quot;Dear Diary,&quot; but it is a nice, slow song.  My favorite song is the third track, &quot;Side&quot;.  It has the best chorus and I love singing along to it.  &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; is another great song that you just need to give a chance.  The fifth song, &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot; is completely awesome.  I love this song and listen to it over and over.  I don't really know much about the other songs cause I listen to the first ones too much, but I can say that after &quot;Humpty Dumpty Love Song&quot; there are two hidden tracks which are brilliant.
0380973650|5.0|i was unable to do anything constructive for hours after i finished AMERICAN GODS.  i just wandered around my apartment, completely dumbfounded.  ambitious in scope, with an almost boundless capacity to surprise, this book and its characters seep deep into your subconscious, likely to remain there for days, if not forever.
0812550706|5.0|i will not be lenghthy. <br />a beautiful book. it explores minds, the horrible and wonderful parts. <br />the end blew me AWAY. <br />the negative review i read said (to me) the reviewer didn't care about any of the characters. pity.
B000002NIW|4.0|I don't see anything wrong with this album as opposed to the &quot;slandering&quot; that Chris Burton gave the deftones.  I think that these boys are highly intelligent and that Chino Moreno has a mystifying voice that ties in with the puzzling drum beats and bass rifts performed by Chi and Abe.  I just think that people that are very narrow-minded and weak hearted, like somebody I just mentioned earlier in this review, shouldn't think about listening to the deftones, let alone write a review about them.  IF YOU think that you can write better or perform better than this group, why are u sitting down slandering their music and not out there making millions of dollars?  If you don't like nu-metal, FINE don't buy the cd....but if you do... go out and buy it.  YOU won't regret it!!!!!
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Check this out I saw Slipknot at Ozfest this year and they more than proved to me they are the best band to ever throw 18 middle fingers in the air. They played three new songs and the only title I remember is Disaster Piece... Yeah it was that awesome. You guys think you know but you have absolutely no idea what these sick sick psycho's from Iowa have in store for you they are going to make you ... youre pants when you hear their new album but dont take it from me check out ozfest if it hasnt passed you by yet you wont be disappointed I guarantee it. and show up early the second stage will blow you away with bands like otep and american headcharge. anyways back to the knot the new albums coming out in August if everything goes right and all you christians go to church and pray now!
B00004Z459|5.0|Is this the best music album ever? Maybe, but it's definately the best in years. When this first came out people were saying that Linkin Park was nothing more than a carbon copy of Limp Bizkit. That theory was blown out of the water after any of those critics listened to any of the songs on the album. No one can say that anymore. Infact Limp Bizkit is garbage compared to Linkin Park. These lyrics have meaning behind them, Limp Bizkit, it's just swearing, it's all for fun, most of it doesn't mean anything. This album is a masterpiece. Most albums today have 1 good song, almost all of the songs on this album are really great. Papercut, Crawling, In The End are great.
B000002NBY|5.0|Its very hard to put in words how good this album is. Im young and dont really know the political significance it had nor do I remember the awards it won. BUT, Ive heard the album many times and know its good enough that I can not hold back from writting a review. The music Paul Simon has given to the public in Graceland is a gift of genius that is hard to define. If I analyzed every song Id be here all day, so in short: Their originality is moving and the talent behind each one is simply amazing.
080017948X|5.0|Groundhog Day is a refreshing retelling of the classic &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; Bill Murray is the Beast and Andie McDowell is Beauty. Bill Murray, a self centered, sarcastic weatherman (Phil Connors) is sent to Punxsatawney, PA to cover Groundhog Day festivities, finds himself trapped living the same day, over and over again.  Andie McDowell plays his beautiful, sensitive and intelligent producer. What do you do when you have to live the same day forever? Harold Ramis spun a very original, funny and enlightening tale around this premise. Bill Murray is the center and this is perhaps one of the best casting choices and performances I have seen from Bill Murray. It was like the script/story was made for him. It is also a more &quot;faithful&quot; telling of the story of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; than Disney's telling a few years back, with some real insight into the nature of what a beast could be. And like Disney's telling, Groundhog Day is full of magic, mystery and comedy and some important life experiences. From a technical point of view, the editing is smack on, never seemingly intrusive, great camera work. The sound is great.
B000001ESN|5.0|This is a must have cd for any fan of Rush's music.For any new fan,this is where I would start.It's all here,great musicianship,great lyrics and great songs.&quot;Natural Science&quot;may be  the best example of thier music's impact if you were to choose one song.The &quot;solo&quot; section of &quot;Freewill&quot; is one of rock's most impressive moments,ever.This band is the most underated band in rock and roll history.This cd is one of their very best.
B00004W5UA|5.0|this is an amazing movie. I didn,t think it would be good but i was wrong. Definitely David Fincher's best movie yet! It is about a guy that's life is falling apart. He all of a sudden meets Tyler (brad pitt) together they join underground fight clubs. There is a surprising climax and great performances by brad pitt and edward norton.

0380729407|5.0|The best book ever.  Granted, that's only an opinion, yet I would not just say that about any book.  What I enjoy so much about this book is great portrayal of the common battle of good vs. evil.  That's an old story, but this book is that storyline in its purest form.   Additionally, the imagery is amazing.  True, it can seem purple at times, but I still enjoyed it immensely.  It really keeps everything interesting.  Just wait until you get to the &quot;smiling bullet.&quot;  Oh yeah, and don't forget to rent the movie, the SCARIEST DISNEY MOVIE EVER.
0064400557|5.0|I liked this because it was exciting.  You never knew what would happen next.  You had no idea how Charlotte the spider was going to save Wilbur the Pig.  I thought it was funny when Wilbur tried to make a web because he was a pig!  The author was good at describing things, especially how the air felt when you were on the swing in the barn.  You should read this book because it is a love book.  Wilbur and Charlotte really stood up for one another. Charlotte saved Wilbur and he saved her egg sac.
0064471837|5.0|This book is a fantasy/horror book.  I read my brother's copy (without asking him hahaha).  Honestly, though, it is a very good book and I recommend it for teen readers.  If you like this book, you should like &quot;Forgotten Beasts of Eld,&quot; &quot;Shadow Moon&quot; (the first book in a trilogy that is the sequel to the movie &quot;Willow&quot;), &quot;Of Two Minds,&quot; and &quot;The Cats of Seroster&quot; (which is unfortunately a very rare book).
630575067X|2.0|Let's face it folks, this movie sucks. As hard and nearly impossible as it would be for George Lucas or anyone else to make a movie that's anywhere near as good as the original Star Wars and/or Empire Strikes Back, this was embarrassingly bad and only a ten year old could like it. What an insult that millions of movie-goers paid to watch a two-hour toy commercial. There was absolutely no story. Something about a Queen? Whatever. Americans could care less about having a Queen. Darth Vader was the greatest villain of all time. It was bad enough that he became Mr. Goodie Two-shoes in Return of the Jedi. Now seeing him as a little brat is just annoying. Okay so the effects are good but who even cares anymore? Effects nowadays are a dime a dozen. In 1977, yes it was impressive. Now it's just expected. George Lucas should've been honest with himself as an artist and admitted his script wasn't as good as it needed to be. How could someone as brilliant as he is overlook what made Star Wars so exciting in the first place? He himself once said that &quot;Without a good story a movie is boring.&quot; Sounds like he was describing this movie. He should have brought a fresh new writer on-board to co-write this; someone determined to make a good movie like George Lucas once was. Everything in Hollywood has become so predictically formulaic that the once rule-breaking rebels like George Lucas have sold-out to the system in the name of being politically correct and to appeal mainly to the pre-puberty crowd. The original trilogy appealed to all ages but this one doesn't even try to. The cast is very weak and desperately needs a Harrison Ford or a Carrie Fischer to carry it. Liam Neeson looks embarrassed and bored out of his mind. He probably was and who could blame him? .
B000056WTG|5.0|Mel Gibson at his best. Definatly one of the best action movies ever made, along with Aliens and the Indiana Jones movies. Action packed the whole way through, [tough] characters, and exellent storyline. It overall is a great movie, but it has some seriously (...)acting! But the bad acting in Aussie is certainly better than the horrible acting of the actors who dubbed over Mel in Mad Max! For people who love good action, you got it right here. For people who are obsessed with violence and action look no further. Road Warrior is a classic action, worth the money and space on your shelf.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|Well.... Though I really enjoy some of the songs on this soundtrack others do not capture the same intensity you feel in the movie or in the entire soundtrack. It was a disapointment to see the songs such as Come One May and Your Song taken down by ...Because we can etc. I also believe that some of the movies best songs were left out. While I was not overly impressed with the quality of the soundtrack, i do enjoy listening to it from time to time.
0060977493|4.0|Arundahti Roy's first novel is a journey into a mysterious country, filled with colours, smells and stories.  The poetry of her prose is intoxicating and allows this reader (and hopefully you too) to journey beyond her small New York apartment to distant lands.<br />The God of Small Things is truly a little miracle and we have to thank Arundhati Roy for having brought it to us.
B000002J1M|5.0|This is Gabriel's best Genesis release. My favorite songs are Watcher Of The Skies, Time Table, Get 'Em Out By Friday, Can-Utility And The Coastliners, and Supper's Ready. Gabriel really shows talent in this one! I highly recommend this to anyone who liked Selling England By The Pound.
0805062971|4.0|This book is different from anything else I've read in a while.  It is not the best from Chuck but I rank it number 2 behind survivor (I have not read Choke yet but it is on the way).  The story has a good plot twist  or two and plenty of social review for the reader to think about.  It is a short read but not for the person looking for the plain old plot.  Read it slow or be prepared to read it twice.
B000002J1O|5.0|This is the best Genesis album with Peter Gabriel. My favorite songs on this album are Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Firth Of Fifth, After The Ordeal, The Cinema Show and Aisle Of Plenty.  I highly recommend this to any Genesis fan!
B000002KXV|5.0|i bought this cd when it first came out in 1982 and it was then and still is the greatest sounding cd of all time.the cd tells a story of a young man growing up during the fifties and running a jazz staion.as usual fagen has assembled the best session players.my favorite track is the new frontier.i love listening to this disc on lazy summer nights
0783240236|5.0|Although some critics and Hitchcock fans have refused to place \\"The Birds\\" along with his best films (such as Psycho, Vertigo, or Rear Window) I would disagree. In fact, \\"The Birds\\", released in 1963, is in my opinion Hitchcock's last truly memorable film, and in many ways it is his most disturbing film. In Hitchcock's other films the villains are always human, but in \\"The Birds\\" it is Mother Nature herself who seems to have gone \\"psycho\\" and our heroes have no real defense. Nor is any motive given for why thousands of birds decide to attack the good folks of Bodega Bay, California - they simply swarm into the town and begin killing off the local population. This film is like a nightmare come to life - a very disturbing, almost surreal look at Mother Nature run amok. Recommended!
0399230033|5.0|My little boy LOVES this story and so do his parents.  Peggy is a smart woman who has a keen insight into a little one's mind.  Her illustrations are such that you can read the story over and over and still see new things (like the mouse carrying a banana on a string on every page).  My toddler yells the words and then gasps and throws his hand over his mouth.  I won't spoil the story line for you. PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK for your little ones.  Even my 8 month old loves it.
B00000IAU3|3.0|This a nice record for people who want their music to be background music.  With the exception of a couple songs, this record isn't particularly engaging.  I strongly suspect the next Dido album with sound exactly like this one as she seems to only have one or two musical ideas.<br />Don't get me wrong, the CD is pleasant enough.  But I've heard it all before.
6304211740|5.0|I, too, must disagree with many of the reviewers who do not like this film.  For me, this version of JANE EYRE works magic-in a quietly intoxicating sort of way.  Case in point: I've been haunted (pleasantly) by its breath-taking scenery shots and its beautiful background music.  I've watched this film three times since I bought the tape-and I bought it just two days ago!!<br />I must confess that I did not take to Gainsbourg's Jane immediately; I found her a bit too reserved.  But cold and stony, as some people find her to be?  Never, for I warmed up to her soon enough: I was drawn by her serene manners, her soft-spoken and intelligent words, and her somewhat otherworldly beauty.  And surely William Hurt's Mr. Rochester would easily fall in love with a woman of such qualities, no?  This is why I must strongly object to the observation that there is no chemistry between Gainsbourg and Hurt.  I see plenty to love in both Gainsbourg's and Hurt's characters.  Why, the scene where Mr. Rochester says good-night &amp; shakes hands with Jane after the \\"midnight fire\\" incident positively sizzles!!! (But doesn't EVERY scene where the two appear together feel so?)   This is not a dramatic film in which grand passion oozes from every scene, but it's not over-the-top, either.  This version of JANE EYRE just sort of draws you patiently and slowly, and it gets better and better upon every re-viewing.  I highly recommend it!
0071359168|5.0|Yes, this is the renowned marketing classic, revered for bringing to light the now ubiquitous strategy of positioning. If you're in business, you probably have at least a fuzzy notion of what the term means. If you're in marketing, you probably hear the word used at least five times a day. (Seriously, try counting.) But in terms of defining positioning and explaining how to use it as a foundation for your strategy, nobody has done a better job than Al Ries and Jack Trout in this original. Of course, the book does have a slightly historical flavor to it now, since the most contemporary business examples cited arrive from the 1970s and 1980s. While a lot has changed since then, a lot hasn't. You'll be surprised how similar this book sounds to the marketing missives of 2001, despite the fact that it was written before the arrival of the Internet, globalization and other buzzwords du jour. We [...] recommend that any executive charged with product development or general business strategy join those in marketing, advertising and sales by taking a few hours to read this book, and get back to the basics.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is their first and best album.  I saw RATM at Lollapalooza in 1993, I never heard of them.  When they hit the stage I was blown away.  I really can't remember now who else played that day, RATM stole the show.  The mosh pit was a small group of ruffians near center stage, but when RATM started to play the mosh pit enveloped the whole crowd.  I was so impressed by their performance I bought their CD the next day.  This CD has the same intensity and raw energy that I saw on stage.  If you don't have this CD and like RATM then you NEED this CD now!  RATM following albums are good, but do not hold up to this one!
1563890119|4.0|An occult sekt performs a ritual meant to trap Death itself but it goes horribly wrong and instead they wind up with Death's younger brother Dream as their prisoner. For over 70 years Dream remains captured. The sekt, who's leadership along the way is passed from father (who grows old) to son, try everything they can think of to make Dream give them unbelievable powers. Dream however never speaks a word to them, waiting for his chance to break free. He has time.  When Dream finally frees himself he returns to his kingdom only to find it shattered in pieces, and he realizes what he's to do now. The start of the road back.<br />This book can in my opinion best be seen as a prequel to the actual Sandman tale, that starts in &quot;A Doll's House&quot;. It isn't really the actual story yet but more a way to get people used to the way of storytelling, some of the characters and what they are made of. What's being done mostly here is laying out some of the dots that are later to be connected. You get introduced to some (later on) vital characters, like Death, Dream, Lucifer, Cain and Abel, whose importance only will become clear later on in the Sandman tale. You learn a little about who Dream is, what his powers are and what they are based on, while he goes on his way to retrieve the items he needs to restore his powers, and later rebuild his kingdom. Items which swerved over existence ever since he was captured and stripped of them.<br />The book contains the first 8 issues of the series but is basically divided in three parts. The first part, that runs from #1-4, is about Dream being captured and about his time of imprisonment. It shows that the story is still being build-up and the art of Sam Keith in these issues is really trying itself out to see if it's suitable. It isn't really great but it's sufficient, something Keith himself later admitted.  The second part, that runs from #5-7, is about Dream in his quest to retrieve the missing items. The story is much better already, more detailed and intertwined with things to come. Especially the part where we get to witness what can be done with Dreams powers when it falls in the wrong hands (really wrong !) is a great read (especially for horror- fans). The art which is taken over by Mike Dringenberg shows to be an improvement and the 'feeling' of the book is starting to build. The third part, #8, is the part where we first get to meet Dreams older sister Death and is really an intermission issue between &quot;Preludes &amp; Nocturnes&quot; and &quot;A Doll's House&quot;. Dream has done what he was supposed to and now he doesn't have a clue where to go from here. His sisters aid is needed to put him back on the right track. Good solid art by Dringenberg and a fluent read, but not really an important issue storywise.<br />I myself consider Sandman as one (if not THE) best comicstories so far and despite my maybe not overly enthousiastic sounding tone in this review, it IS a very nice read. Not as good as the later issues/TPB's but that says more about them than about this book. &quot;Nocturnes &amp; Preludes&quot; is really a great, and probably even neccesary, introduction to the tale later to be unraveled. There are some things being explained here that shouldn't be missed for a maximum enjoyment of the tale that's coming. People who's main-interest is not superheroes but something more of a realistic/dramatic/horrorized Fantasy tale (think of things like Hellblazer and Saga of the Swamp Thing) will surely have a good time with this book, and even more with the following books after that.

B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannible can only be described as a slasher film with smarts, style and plenty of chills. The title character Hannible Lecture has been on the lose for seven years, after having escaped in the film &quot;Silence of the lambs&quot;. Yet now one of Lecture's victims whom survived his encounter from Lecture, only to be a paralyised disfigured psychotic bent on revenge, Mason Verger. Clarice Starling also returns in this film as an FBI agent tring to capture Lecture while being made a sacrifical lamb for a drug bust gone bad and trying to stop Verger from killing Hannible. The cinematography and art direction are both superb and the acting is top rate from Anthony Hopkins, Julie Moore, and a very unrecognizable Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. The make-up effects are stunning especially on the imfamous &quot;dinner&quot; scene. A fair warning though Hannible contains plenty of strong graphic violence, gore, mature themes and language. The films content can be compared to the likes of Seven, and 8mm. This is strictly for an adult audiance only! For anyone who wants a psychological thriller and a horrifying slasher film with top rate direction by Ridely Scott, whom graced us all with Blade Runner and Gladiator, then you need look no further then Hannible.
0684859106|2.0|After reading all the rave reiviews this cookbook got, I couldn't wait to start baking.  Boy was I disappointed with the first two recipes I tried.  The Chocolate Buttermilk Layer Cake was not sweet enough and very dry.  The Strawberry Oat Bars were very bland (needed more sugar in pastry) and the baking time needed to be doubled for crust and crumb topping.  I'll give it one more shot...
B000002I6V|5.0|This is one EXCELLENT album from &quot;more than his share&quot; of CSN(and sometimes Y).  These are great, soulful songs, best listened to when you've just lost your love or on a rainy day.  Somehow, you feel tons better after listening to them.  Although I've an extensive collection of music, this always makes the turntable/CD player on a regular rotation.  Can't miss.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash, &quot;London Calling&quot; is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. It is an enduring classic that sounds just as good today as it did 22 years ago when it was first released.  It combines punk, rock, funk, r &amp; B, jazz, reggae and so much more.  The Clash were ridiculed by hardcore fans when this was released because they felt that the only band that mattered had abadoned their legions. That they were selling out to the man. One fan claimed to have yelled at Joe Strummer, &quot;Hey Joe! My grandma listens to you now!&quot;  Even if that were true, does that make the album any less powerful or less important. The Clash did not release very many full length albums. Most of the cd's you will find are compilations, live events or European releases.  Of the full length albums, this and their debut, (the British version) are absolute monumental releases that have influenced and generated a whole new breed of groups.  Think The Red Hot Chili Peppers with a cockney accent. Do yourself a favor. Include this in your cd rack. You'll thank me later
0060254939|5.0|I read this book when I was five; I still read it now; and I'm sure I'll read it until I die. The imagination of Sendak's work is timeless. Everytime I read this book, I feel like a young boy, like Max, imagining the world around me change into a jungle, a desert, whatever, inhabited by all kinds of little beasties ! The power of this book comes from a universal desire of children: To change the world around them, to be the kings of that world, and subdue all who inhabit it.<br />This desire lays in adults as well, though dormant in many, but can be re-kindled by leafing through these wonderful pages once more. I recomend this to all children, children at heart, and those who never stopped being children.
B00003CX6P|5.0|Manipulation...Lies...Deceit...Callous Exploitation...treating people as expendable, throw-away objects to satisfy personal whims or desires...ah, yes...those things only happened in the \\"La Dolce Vita\\" days of the 1950s, right???   Right???    Should we get ourselves all bent out of shape in trying to figure out whether Tom Ripley is \\"likeable\\" or not...a better question, perhaps, would be: is the character believable, or not...given the nature of our times and the lack of values which prevail in most of the contemporary, hedonistic, pleasure-above-all culture...or do we blame slogans like \\"Have it YOUR way!\\" and \\"What YOU want is what you get!\\" for brain-washing people into fantasizing that they can manipulate life and people into any sort of configuration they choose if they have the money or the power or the celebrity or the cleverness to do it?    Is there, indeed, a likeable character in this film?...maybe only the Marge figure...Dickie Greenleaf is certainly a self- centered, manipulative, callous, exploitive, self-indulgent, narcissistic vampire...feeding off one and all for his own pleasure...and sardonic amusement...his chum is even scummier and more abrasive, if a bit more insightful than Dickie... and the yappy American young woman is a fount of over-privileged, empty-headed, clingy whining...   Which leaves Tom Ripley...so he is \\"poor\\"...but he is gifted... he plays a good piano...has an incredible gift for mimickry...<br />has pretty good psychological understanding...of others...if not of himself...but his methods are definitely beyond any sort of rational justification...why does he kill Dickie?...supposedly because he loves Dickie...and Dickie mocks him and calls him a girl and tells him he is a bore...and a clinger...of course, Tom tells Dickie a thing or two about Dickie, which doesn't enlighten Dickie...only infuriates him...and thus, the confrontation...and the horror of that fury letting loose (....)Tom says some insightful things about himself...but one doesn't really know when he is being truthful...and when he is just rationalizing... and self-justifying...can he EVER be believed? ...   On first viewing, I felt this might be an anti-homosexual tract playing on public fear and prejudice...and helping to fuel the idea that homsexuality is supposedly a mental illness...it is too bad that one of the underlying motivations should have to be stirred up like this...don't know what the original author's view on the topic was...but given the filmed representations of it in Hitchcock's \\"Strangers on a Train\\" and now with this film, it seems to be a negative one...   But subsequent viewings have caused me to lessen that idea because the film has deeper things to say about society in general...and the people influenced by it...whether they be \\"straight\\" or homosexual (is Dickie Greenleaf a representative of the best aspects of being \\"straight\\"...for that matter, who in the film is a positive role model for being \\"straight\\"...certainly not Dickie's father...nor Dickie...nor his friend...nor Dickie's secret Italian sex object...again, maybe only poor ineffectual, ever-true despite her insights about Dickie --Marge)...although, in \\"The English Patient,\\" I found when I went back to check out this idea in relation to the director, that the British archaeologist who has an attraction to one of the male Arabs winds up wrecking the truck because of it...perhaps an insight into the director's bias about the topic? ...did he choose to film this work because he knew the author of the work shared a  similar bias to his own in relation to his own...plus the fact that it is a socially provocative issue? ...   The photography is incredibly beautiful...the clarity of the DVD version enhances it even more...the coloring is an integral part of the atmosphere...the music is also evocative and haunting...especially the song at the beginning of the film...singing of love...of love...    The whole scene on the beach...when Tom first plots to \\"meet\\" Dickie and Marge...is taut with sensuality, attraction, irony, and \\"beauty is only skin-deep\\"  implications...but then there is the whole thing of the attraction...and deception...of appearances... especially of good-looking appearances...when they \\"come on\\" as naive, \\"earnest,\\" slightly inept...    This film is deeper and more intriguing than it may at first appear...worth several viewings...it is one of those films like \\"What Lies Beneath\\" (what a wonderful punning title...could also have been the punning title for this film about Tom Ripley...what LIES, beneath...get it?... deceptions beneath the surface...)that never get old even with repeated viewings...
B00005LB9O|5.0|Travis is more than just a pop band.  They're a phenomenon in today's music industry:  they're genuinely nice guys, they're grounded and humble, and Fran Healy writes the best pop songs this side of the Beatles and Neil Finn. <br /> There are a few misconceptions about Travis, though.  First off, they aren't Radiohead wannabes.  They pride themselves for their accessibility.  And just to set the record straight, Fran doesn't really sound like Thom Yorke at all.  I love Radiohead, but if Yorke ever sang with the earnestness and emotion that Fran Healy does, I would eat my shoes... with ketchup.  Also, they don't want to save music.  They want their music to save music.  Ok, now that that's established... <br /> THE INVISBLE BAND is the best Travis album yet.  And that's BIG STUFF when you consider Travis' last album, the jawdroppingly wonderful THE MAN WHO.  That album had a handful of hit singles and even more perfectly crafted pop songs.  THE INVISIBLE BAND definitely picks up right where THE MAN WHO left off.  Healy has written some even more gorgeous and delicate melodies than before.  Songs like the lilting &quot;Pipe Dreams,&quot; the magical &quot;Humpty Dumpty Love Song&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot; boast tear-jerking melodies and arrangements.  Elsewhere, &quot;Side&quot; is the catchiest song they've written since &quot;Why Does It Always Rain On Me,&quot; and &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot; and &quot;Follow The Light&quot; are so sunnily beautiful that they would make McCartney blush with glee.<br /> The only thing that seems to be lacking from THE INVISIBLE BAND that THE MAN WHO possessed is a sense of purpose.  THE MAN WHO wasted no time in commanding the listener's attention.  But where THE MAN WHO used a &quot;Driftwood&quot; or &quot;Turn&quot; to wow the listener into conciousness of the amazing album in their possession, THE INVISIBLE BAND is snakey and subtle.  The melodies are immediate, but something about the play order makes the album's intent intangible. <br /> But repeated listens reveal that the band is simply content with their place in pop.  THE INVISIBLE BAND is a soundtrack to life.  There are songs about love (&quot;Sing,&quot; &quot;Flowers In the Window,&quot; and &quot;The Humpty Dumpty Love Song&quot;).  Songs about failure and disillusionment (&quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;).  Songs about following your beliefs (&quot;Follow The Light&quot;).  And songs about just being content with life in general (&quot;Indefinitely&quot; and &quot;Safe&quot;). <br /> Travis may never be as idolized as Radiohead, as wistfully remembered as Simon and Garfunkel, or as revered as The Beatles. But (and I say this with the full knowledge that many will guffaw at this statement) Travis is every bit as good as those bands.  Only time will prove that this is one invisible band that will become more relevant as the years and trends pass them happily by.
B000002MP2|4.0|Green Day's third realease, Dookie, is known to be one of the better albums of the 1990's and many say this is the album that broke punk rock into the mainstream. This album was not just great for punk, it also was great for Green Day, because this broke them into the mainstream also. The sound of this album is alot different than from Kerplunk and 1039, because Billie Joe's voice has more of a twang to it. This album has some GREAT hits from the 90's but the end of the album has some throwaways in it (F.O.D is an exception to that). Burnout, Longview, Welcome to Paradise, She, When I Come Around, Strung Out, and F.O.D are my favorites.
B000002UB6|4.0|This was my favorite of the later Beatle works. The focal point was the rooftop concert as shown in the movie, even though when I saw the movie, I was too young to perceive that it was showing the disintegration of the Beatles. My pet peeve is that &quot;Don't Let me Down&quot; which they also performed on the rooftop was left off of the album. Great song on this album were &quot;One over 909&quot; and &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; I think the &quot;raw&quot; sound of the live performance is what makes this album special. One interesting sidelight is how the bearded McCartney contrasts with the Three clean shaven Beatles. It may be a sign of how McCartney was showing the need to go another direction.  An added bonus to this soundtrack was  the superior keyboard playing of Billy Preston. He was the first non Beatle to get label credit with the group.
B000059H98|5.0|Tank Girl is one of the funnest movies of all time.  Colorful characters, adorable writing, and a childish toys-and-bright-colors style gives this movie a distinctive comic book feel.  Lori Petty makes this movie what it is with her strong and bubbly personality, and Malcolm McDowel plays the ultimate villain.  If you're looking for a movie with energy, pick this one up.  The soundtrack is also incredible, and I'm not usually a person who likes soundtracks.
B000003TAW|5.0|I got this CD a couple of weeks ago, and I can't stop listening to it.  It's addictive, and a terrific alternative to the boy band craze.  Their lyrics are catchy, and I'm dying to see them in concert!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I read a lot of reviews of this soundtrack before I bought it and so I was prepared for the fact that it was not the &quot;actual&quot; soundtrack, but a collection of the songs used in the movie. By itself, it's a great album. How can you go wrong with Bowie, Beck, Bono and the songs sung by the cast members? But it just made me hungry for more. What we need is a full cast recording from the film; a CD that resembles the recordings available from Broadway shows. I want all the music, all the layers, all the reprises and some of the dialogue and I would be willing to pay through the nose for it. If you loved the film, the CD is worth buying. But I sure hope they aren't finished!
B00004YA0T|5.0|I have heard these recordings on both Angel and EMI lps, on the first cd boxed set issue, on the more recent &quot;twofer&quot; issues (3 and 7, for example) and on Seraphim cd (4 and 9). This new compilation has by far the best sound. This is absolutely beautiful Bruckner, and I don't know how the riches of these recordings eluded the engineers till now.<br />I just finished listening to symphonies 1 through 3 and the warmth and balance of the sections of the Dresden orchestra remind me of Dutch painting from the 17th century. Everything glows, and seemingly glows from within! The sheer weight of the sound at the end of the Second Symphony first movement amazed me, and that is just one example.<br />I'm not sure if these were all originally analog recordings or part analog, part digital as in the von Karajan DG set. Frankly, I don't care. I'm just glad they got it right this time!
B00005B36H|5.0|you are all going to burn for even listening to this one, but it's damned good - so it's probably worth it. Maynard is Satan, but again the music is great, so...yadda yadda...the next step for them is what - to record the breaking of the Seals? Maybe a multicast video of Paz petting the Fourhorses before their big ride? I love Paz! I miss her so...gimme some insight of some Euro goings on, May-may, don't just stick to the States - it was great learning about comedians who died well before their time or guys from Area51, but teach us something about Jerusalem, Palestine, or even Persia for DaLawd's sake!
B00005LMBK|5.0|any album that has samples from &quot;day of the dead&quot; on it has to be good!
0553106635|5.0|After finishing The Wheel of Time series, I went searching on the Internet for another fantasy/sci-fi series, and came across A Song of Ice and Fire.<br />Simply put, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is the best fantasy series I've ever read.  When I purchased the first book, I was leery of more Jordan-clone books.  However, this series couldn't be more different than Jordan's work and still remain in the realm of fantasy.<br />Of course, there are a few common elements between Jordan and Martin, but using the word &quot;fantasy&quot; to describe Martin's work is inaccurate.  Martin writes reality.  If you're looking for a series where the characters are always perfect, where the protagonists always win at sometimes ridiculous odds, and most importantly where you always have a &quot;good feeling&quot; at the end of each book, type &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot; in that search box above.  Martin's books are real.  In the real medieval world, people killed each other sometimes for no reason at all, unexpected events could and did occur, there were no clear good guys, and the noblest people didn't always win.  In The Wheel of Time, one major protagonist dies in the entire series.  In just the third book of A Song of Ice and Fire alone, at least three are killed (&quot;Or were they actually killed?&quot;, you ask yourself), some of whom even serve as Martin's points of view!<br />Of course, I couldn't miss the reviews that were posted on the page for &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; bashing Martin's work for various reasons.  I became leery when I read those reviews hinting at excessive profanity and violence.  Whoever wrote such a thing should be thrown into a &quot;black cell&quot; in King's Landing - there is nothing excessive about the violent scenes in A Song of Ice and Fire.  I did not come across one instance where violence, profanity, or sexual content was used in an inapproriate manner, nor do these themes dominate the book.  When Martin is trying to show how cruel some characters can be, he does so appropriately, but not excessively.  He also omits extreme language and violence that would only degrade his purpose.  If you still think that these elements could have been omitted completely, think of how this novel would go over if Tyrion yelled, &quot;Oh, darn.  That knight almost shashed my head off.  My goodness, I could have been injured.&quot;<br />Others criticize Martin's lack of magic in the series.  One reviewer commented that magic hardly appears overtly at all in this series.  I say &quot;overtly&quot; because there are many instances where a magical event occurs and the reader is informed of it secondhand.  I was fully content with Martin's magicless world for the first few hundred pages of the series, and then I heard the first mention of the Lord of Light.  I was ready to curse Martin for ruining such a realistic, well-thought-out realm by including magic.  As it turns out, however, magic is there in the background and adds to the story, while not overpowering everything like it does in The Wheel of Time.  The lack of magic keeps the reader interested when something magical occurs, while the opposite occurs in The Wheel of Time: I found myself skipping Mat's chapters.  It was almost as if he was unimportant because he could not wield the Power like most of the other characters in that book.<br />Finally, both Martin's and Jordan's novels look to turn into an epic series when they are complete.  However, while Jordan extends his novels pointlessly because he's not sure what to write, Martin extends his novels because he is exactly sure what to write - he has so many plot twists and important information to include that it couldn't be contained in a thinner book.<br />In conclusion, if you're struggling to finish the last few drawn-out installments of The Wheel of Time, then give it up and read A Song of Ice and Fire.  If you're tired of the fluff that's included in many series today to perpetuate them for eternity so the author can make more money, then read A Song of Ice and Fire.  But if you're new to the genre, then avoid A Song of Ice and Fire at all costs, because when you've experienced the best, there's nowhere to go but down.
B000002C4J|5.0|This last entire english new material album from Celine Dion shows a more mature side of her talent,and proves that the succes of &quot;Falling Into You&quot; was not a passer-by one but instead the entrance to the Diva-world. &quot;Let's Talk About Love&quot; is by far the best album modern pop has ever produced during the past 20 years to say the least. There are simply too much stars involved in the recording of this album. There are practically no mistakes and there is a great coherence and cohesion between all of the tracks. No way this could ever be boring simply because it has a great diversity, starting with the common excellent well produced diva-pop and ending with a hip-hop cover and one or two extremely danceable songs. The album begins with &quot;The Reason&quot;, a top vocal track which features the help of role model Carole King. On the following track The Bee Gees appear both as songwriters and as fellow singers turning &quot;Immortality&quot; into and very emotional and romantic song. On her hip-hop effort, Celine is being hepled by jamaican Diana King and Brownstone treesome. In fact, this one is a cover of Diana's 1995 &quot;Treat her like a lady&quot;.  &quot;Tell Him&quot; is the star duet on this album,Ms Dion teenage years' inspiration Barbra Streisand, having an important role in the succes of the song. It is overproduces, nevertheless tiresome. Still it is simple and clear, making it one of the most enjoyable musical experiences ever. There's also another beautiful cover on the album, &quot;When I Need You&quot;, which goes on great with Celine's voice. The last duet is with classical singer Luciano Pavarotti turning on a more serious side of pop music, a more classical one.  On top of that the famous producer George Martin (Beatles) helps on &quot;The Reason&quot;, Walter Afanasieff and David Foster on &quot;Tell Him&quot; and several other tracks plus production work from music giants such as Rick Wake (previously worked on &quot;The Colour...&quot;), Corey Hart, Jim Steinman, Brian Adams, Jean-Jaques Goldman etc. There is also a spanish track on some non US editions &quot;Amar Haciendo el Amor&quot; on which Celine shows she has no problems with her fifth singing language. This is the work of Emilio Estefan Jr.  But what surely made this album so important is the Titanic theme which needs no description.  Next to those songs there are some great romantic tracks such as &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; and the title track.  Inspite of the cliche phrase this really is a masterpiece album which fits in any respectable CD collection. In fact you cannot say you know music unless you've tasted this one aswell.  All i have to say now is &quot;Enjoy it!&quot; because i know you will.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I bought the Moulin Rouge CD at Amazon and I think it is really good. It's worth the investment and I am surprised why the movie is not doing too well. I thought it was alright.

B000056K04|4.0|The Dave Matthews Band have transcended the norms in Rock and Roll while remaining fresh, creative and entertaining. The band's jazz/folk/rock salad has delighted more young adults and attracted more crowds over the years that they could become the Grateful Dead of the new Millenium. With their departure disc, &quot;Everyday&quot;, the band decided to make a recording that would cater more to males instead of females. In stating that, I mean that previous Matthew's recordings reeled in the female gender like game fish. And when girls would buy a cd like &quot;Crash&quot; or &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; they would make their boyfriends listen and hence a new fan was born. This time around Matthews has more of a rock sound that guys would get into more. Matthews himself is no Slash or Eddie Van Halen, but he uses electric guitars on many of the numbers in lieu of Acoustic to throw a curve ball at conventional Matthew's disciples to see if they can still catch and I liked that. This disc is for guys who want good date music, but don't want to sacrifice their masculinity. It's not too mushy, but just romantic enough to flatter. I recently saw the band play the new songs live and it sounds great. They are the band that can't go wrong and with the new CD, they will undoubtedly broaden their audience with more guys and their new girlfriends.

On the following track The Bee Gees appear both as songwriters and as fellow singers turning &quot;Immortality&quot; into and very emotional and romantic song. On her hip-hop effort, Celine is being hepled by jamaican Diana King and Brownstone treesome. In fact, this one is a cover of Diana's 1995 &quot;Treat her like a lady&quot;.  &quot;Tell Him&quot; is the star duet on this album,Ms Dion teenage years' inspiration Barbra Streisand, having an important role in the succes of the song. It is overproduces, nevertheless tiresome. Still it is simple and clear, making it one of the most enjoyable musical experiences ever. There's also another beautiful cover on the album, &quot;When I Need You&quot;, which goes on great with Celine's voice. The last duet is with classical singer Luciano Pavarotti turning on a more serious side of pop music, a more classical one.  On top of that the famous producer George Martin (Beatles) helps on &quot;The Reason&quot;, Walter Afanasieff and David Foster on &quot;Tell Him&quot; and several other tracks plus production work from music giants such as Rick Wake (previously worked on &quot;The Colour...&quot;), Corey Hart, Jim Steinman, Brian Adams, Jean-Jaques Goldman etc. There is also a spanish track on some non US editions &quot;Amar Haciendo el Amor&quot; on which Celine shows she has no problems with her fifth singing language. This is the work of Emilio Estefan Jr.  But what surely made this album so important is the Titanic theme which needs no description.  Next to those songs there are some great romantic tracks such as &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; and the title track.  Inspite of the cliche phrase this really is a masterpiece album which fits in any respectable CD collection. In fact you cannot say you know music unless you've tasted this one aswell.  All i have to say now is &quot;Enjoy it!&quot; because i know you will.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge was one of those movies that had to grow on me, but boy did it! I was skeptical at first but left the theater absolutely in love with this one of a kind movie. So many movie directors/producers these days are so caught up in making their movies mirror reality that they forget that movies are supposed to entertain. Moulin Rouge left reality to the side for a couple of hours and poured on the entertainment. This movie was definitely odd, it messed with my senses big time. During the opening scene I felt like I had just done an insane amount of drugs, yet this effect let me leave reality behind me and just relax and enjoy myself for the evening. What a clever, fantastic movie, definitely go see it! One note though, if you are not interested in seeing an artsy film you will probably not enjoy this movie as much, you must go in with an open mind.
B000002C4J|5.0|This last entire english new material album from Celine Dion shows a more mature side of her talent,and proves that the succes of &quot;Falling Into You&quot; was not a passer-by one but instead the entrance to the Diva-world. &quot;Let's Talk About Love&quot; is by far the best album modern pop has ever produced during the past 20 years to say the least. There are simply too much stars involved in the recording of this album. There are practically no mistakes and there is a great coherence and cohesion between all of the tracks. No way this could ever be boring simply because it has a great diversity, starting with the common excellent well produced diva-pop and ending with a hip-hop cover and one or two extremely danceable songs.

B00003CX5P|1.0|It's just not the same. I mean how many people want to sit at a 2 hour movie just to see special effects?? Did George Lucas get side-tracked having all this technology now to work with and not focusing as much on the actual story? The story was there, but the way he fit it into the movie. I kept on waiting for a powerful or exciting part to happen, but it never happened. The person you can always count on though is John Williams. He did a fantastic job with the music yet again. Anyways, Jar Jar took the place of C-3PO, by being the annoying character. HOWEVER, C-3PO played a much more interesting part. Jar jar was just plain annoying. Plus the movie at some points looks like a little kids movie. Jar Jar making stupid jokes and Anakin having no idea what he is doing and out of the blue blowing up the space ship is a little weird. There was not that relationship you can feel you have with the characters. There were the romantic (han and leia), the emotional, and powerful scenes in ANH, ESB, and ROJ. I can pick my favorite character out of the original trilogy, which would probably be either han or leia. I can only pick the most annoying in episode 1. I have seen mixed reviews about this movie. I can only say that the people who liked it weren't so much interested in the story but in the neat ships and great technology they had. I would like a great story and a powerful ending, such as in A new hope,  Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The casting needs to be worked on also in the phantom menace. Plus, how many weird looking creatures could George Lucas fit into episode 1??? My favorite is the Empire STrikes Back because it had the least amount of weird aliens in it. It actually had mostly real people! I just hope the George Lucas realizes that he didn't please as many people with his JUST special effects show as he might think. I would suggest going back and do it how you did the TRILOGY!
B00004U60I|1.0|I have other baby einstein videos, and my 14 month son loves them all except this one... there is a short sequence in the beginning with an opera puppet singing that scares him.  It startled me as well to tell the truth, and I can see why he doesn't like it. I meant to edit the sequence out, but after watching the video several times, I find it is really uninspired compared to the others and have decided not to keep it.
B00004XONN|5.0|Wow.  You can almost see the music dancing about in front of you.  I loved OK Computer, but this album is different - more mature and comfortable with itself, I guess, which is ironic for an album named &quot;Kid A&quot;.  Radiohead just keeps moving forward, and what results is pure musical genius.  Buy this.  Now.  Wow.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I stumbled into this movie by accident.  It was the only one showing that day that I found even remotely interesting and it was free.  I go to the movies about once every 2 years.  I prefer to rent them and watch them at home, or buy them.  Well, I never had such a good time with a movie in my life.  It is incomparable to anything I have ever seen before.  It is kind of a cross between Rocky Horror Picture show and Caberet and Romeo and Juliet.  And can Ewan MacGregor sing?  Hell Yes!!  He carries this movie!  Nicole isn't bad for an actress, but Ewan is awesome.  If you like Ewan MacGregor even a little, this movie will make you love him.  ...  I have already bought the soundtrack and listen to it constantly.  It brings back the feel of the movie.  I can't wait for it to come out on video.  And I am considering making the jump to DVD, just for this movie.  I LOVED it!! And that is an understatement.
0465068359|5.0|<br /> I picked up a copy of  &#8220;The Rape of Nanking&#8221; to bring with me on a leisurely vacation. I made the mistake of reading the first page three days in advance of leaving and I couldn&#8217;t put the book down. I read it at night before falling asleep. I read it first thing in the morning while my coffee was brewing. I read it while standing on line at motor vehicles. As a result I have nothing to read while on vacation.<br />This is an incredible book in every conceivable respect and when I use the word &#8220;incredible&#8221;, I mean it quite literally. It boggles the mind to such an extent that the reader can hardly process the material presented as historical fact.  The book shines a light upon the details of the December, 1937 Japanese invasion of Nanking, China and exposes the facts of a situation so horrible as to be unimaginable to any reasonable person. If I have one word of warning to the prospective reader of this book it is that you might not want to know these details. First, they will stay with you, maybe forever, and what they will cause you to envision isn&#8217;t pretty. Second, these details will frustrate the reader in that human nature as I know it is such that one will want to do something to prevent this horror after the fact.<br />Iris Chang is a highly talented writer and this book is written so well that if the entire story were a work of fiction it would be a worthy read. Unfortunately, it is not a work of fiction. She is also masterful journalist and this is demonstrated not only by her uncovering of the facts that comprise this book but also by her unbiased presentation of this material. Japan is not simply an &#8220;evil empire&#8221; in Chang&#8217;s presentation. China, and even the Chinese citizenry of Nanking during the invasion, are not simply helpless victims of the Japanese barbarian hordes. She speaks of Chinese traitors as readily as she speaks of Japanese atrocities. In fact, I suspect that I am having more difficulty writing an unbiased review of her book than she apparently had writing an unbiased book. However, rather than go off on a tirade here let me simply say that by today&#8217;s standards, the United States would be roundly criticized by the international community as well as by most American people if we were to sit idly by as any aggressor nation inflicted the level of pain and suffering upon the innocent, unarmed citizenry of any country as is described in this book. Today we attack Serbia for being involved in a civil war and for expelling Albanians from its borders and we act as if this is the obvious thing to do. In 1937, we watched and did nothing as the Japanese brought wholesale rape, murder and unimaginable mayhem to the simple people of Nanking. Where&#8217;s the justice? Where&#8217;s the equality? Where&#8217;s the compassion that we so commonly feign today?<br />As usual, when I finish a great book I am left with questions that I have no way of finding answers to. For example, Ms. Chang, if Chinese soldiers resisting the Japanese invasion fired upon fleeing Chinese soldiers who had gotten word to retreat, and if many Chinese were hurt and possibly killed in the panic to flee Nanking, how many of the 300,000 Chinese dead were not killed by the Japanese?  ... <br />I envision Amy Tan reading this book shortly before having written &#8220;The Bonesetter&#8217;s Daughter&#8221;. It was that book that gave me the idea to read this book. By all means, you should read this book too.  It left me with a strong desire to read more about this fiasco and, if I can track it down, to see John Magee&#8217;s film, referred to throughout. If you do read this book, keep the following words in mind as you read and tell me they are antiquated and have no meaning in modern society.<br />\\"A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\\"<br />Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution

B000002UB3|5.0|Ringo Starr's drumming dominates ABBEY ROAD, the Beatles' swan song. Critics and fans usually discuss the rock-n-roll of Lennon's &quot;Come Together&quot; or &quot;She's So Heavy,&quot; the balladry of Harrison's &quot;Something&quot; or &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; or the McCartney-dominated pop suite on side two. Indeed, their contributions are admirable, but Ringo's superb drumming knits the album together. When the Beatles acquired Ringo's services in late 1962, their mind-blowing sound began to jell. Although he flew all over his kit in the Beatles' live shows in Hamburg and Liverpool (catch his apocalyptic drumming in &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; on LIVE AT THE STAR CLUB [1962]), his studio work from the beginning (I vastly prefer his drumming to Alan White's in &quot;Love Me Do&quot;) stressed simple rhythmical frameworks. His musical genius shined in the deep, soulful sound he coaxed from his kit. His drumming is powerful and his touch is inspired in songs such as &quot;Please, Please Me,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; &quot;Ticket to Ride,&quot; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,&quot; &quot;Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (the reprise too), &quot;Revolution,&quot; and numerous others. When McCartney occasionally took over the drumming, his sound was thin and weak (&quot;Back in the USSR&quot; and &quot;Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; are good examples). Ringo knows how to combine the tom-tom and bass drum to lay a deep bottom underneath the sparkling sonic superstructure elaborate by Lennon, Harrison, and McCartney. Nowhere is Ringo's rhythmical flourish more apparent than on ABBEY ROAD. His tom-tom is funky and soulful on &quot;Come Together,&quot; and his tumbles add sonic drama to &quot;Something,&quot; while his brush work and rhythmical inversion on &quot;She's So Heavy&quot; are delightful. His adaptability to stylistic shifts in the suite demonstrate his mastery of the numerous styles that the other three threw at him over the years. Hisbrief rumble toward the end is a showcase of the rock-n-roll spirit that animates the best of the Beatle music. I encourage everyone to by this record and to listen to the sonic virtuosity of Ringo's drumming. You won't be disappointed.
B00000AFFI|5.0|This album is a much mellower, subdued album both sonically and lyrically than her previous two albums. It's like the morning after the night before. An emphasis in placed on distorted synths that replaced the white noise haze of before. The tracks in general sound hazy and distant, giving the album a lathargic feeling: neither awake nor totally asleep.<br />Not that the album doesn't have its powerful moments. 'The Sky Lit Up' and 'No Girl So Sweet' are frantic sonic explosions, PJs voice intense enough to jolt one out of the chill out semi slumber the other tracks induce. 'A Perfect Day Elise' is enough franctic upbeat track in a rather catchy danceified way. 'Joy' with monotone singing and grating distorted sonic effects, will scare the life out of you.<br />'The Wind' 'The Garden' and 'The River' seem almost as a trilogy dispersed accross the album, beautiful piano based ballads combine with PJ's spiritual fascination with the elements. 'The River' in particular, is just so beautiful.<br />The remainder of the album is essentially swampy blues heightened by Nine Inch Nails style warped sound effects. Best examples are 'My Beautiful Leah' 'Catherine' and 'Electic Light.' The title track is more acoustic based whereas 'Angelene,' my favorite track off the album, sounds much like one of Patti Smith's piano based ballads from her Horses album (think Free Money or Elegie.)<br />Lyrically, this album isn't as provocative or as stark as 'To Bring You My Love' but retains a more enigmatic mysterious quality with a narrative skill in some songs that rivals and almost outmatches Dylan. While not depressing, the songs do evoke either resignated melancholy or creepy brooding.<br />It isn't the most assesible of albums, none of PJs material is. However its worth the 'what the hell' sensation one will get from the first couple of listens and once that passes this is one of the msot listenable offerings she has ever produced.
6305736650|1.0|OK.. I don't understand why people praise this as the best movie of all time? I just don't find anything special in this movie. The film starts real sloooooooow and I almost fell asleep waiting for Bogart's character to appear and I waited half an hour for Ingrid's character to appear. A real dissapoinment!
B000059QY3|5.0|Holy moley!  I thought the praise on the DVD box was too effusive, too uncritical, too much marketing hype.  Now I'm a believer.  This is just about as perfect a performance as you could ever ask for.  Regardless of what you may think or know of her (well-publicized) offstage behavior, Angela Gheorghiu is simply beyond reproach in this live video.  She looks like the ideal Violetta, her acting is very moving, and best of all, she sings the part as it was meant to be sung -- musically, dramatically, thrillingly.  She judges her dynamics perfectly, never singing too loud -- she projects even the softest of pianissimos over the orchestra -- but she can really rip out the high notes when called for.  Her coloratura is flawless, and yet it never sticks out like a mere technical show (as with some singers) -- when she sings it, it's an integral part of the drama of the moment.  She sings the lyrical, legato passages with a genuine sense of line, but she also sings the whole with just the right amount of declamation.  Her voice is very pleasing to the ear, yet distinctive and instantly recognizable.  Now I can finally understand why people went nuts over Maria Callas 40-50 years ago.  I'll probably get some grief for making this comparison, as I'm a Callas ignoramus, but I imagine that this performance by Gheorghiu must be like what Callas's performances used to be like -- perfect singing, perfect acting, and perfect *integration* of singing and acting.<br />Everyone else on this video is pretty good, too.  In fact, Solti is (was) great -- his conducting is exciting and his tempos are, on the whole, well judged.  Frank Lopardo is a solid Alfredo, and Leo Nucci a somewhat bland but decent Germont -- and like Gheorghiu, they each totally look the part.  The sound and picture quality are both very good.<br />The only thing that maddens me is that it took Decca so ridiculously long (almost 7 years) to release this video in the United States.  (I think it was available in othercountries on VHS.)  Well, at any rate, it's here now, so what are you waiting for?  Get it!
0800141601|5.0|this movie is worth seeing at least once if you like knights, forbitten romance, violence, sean, or richard hey what you waiting for
0345442989|5.0|I was very impressed with this novel from the very beginning through the end.<br />After seeing Episode 1, I'm sure you and your friends pondered on how the Neimodians and Darth Sidious first got involved.  How did the Trade Federation set up the blockade of Naboo?  Just how did Queen Amidala become queen?  How did Chancellor Vallorum become perceived as incompetent as to heading the Republic?  And just who is this enigmatic young Senator Palpatine?<br />Well this novel does an excellent job of setting the stage for Episode One.  The double talk and blameless Palpatine shines as the master manipulator.  We stand in the shoes of Vallorum and watch the invisible power plays consume his effectiveness as a leader.  We watch the rise of Rune Hakao and Nute Gunray and their dealing with this cloaked figure who issues them a deal they cannot refuse.<br />Was also nice to see more of the Jedi council in action.  Mace Windu, Yoda, Qui Gon and even a younger Obi-wan in their attempts to bring peace to the galaxy.<br />The majority of the story revolves around a plot and conspiracy to bring down Chancellor Vallorum as head of the Republic and stave off a boiling contention between the worlds of the outer rim and the core through trade routes, pirates, and taxation.<br />New characters are introduced into the Star Wars mythos that are really exciting, and their actions, while at the time may seem innocent, set the stage for what will become the Empire....with everyone's strings being pulled by Darth Sidious.<br />A few other characters make cameos including Bail Organa and A young Governor Tarkin.<br />This is not your typical Star Wars novel.  It is very deep in conspiracy, plot twists, and black ops.  A very enjoyable read.
B000003TA4|5.0|What could I possibly add to a stack of some 570 reviews of one of the classics of modern music.  It's very, very good.  Buy it now.  Boy it yesterday.  Just buy it, or you're seriously missing out.
B0000024SI|5.0|I have to agree with my colleagues reviews in all respects. The songs on this album (how old am I?) are a &quot;sav&quot; for pain I went through growing up. How lost I can find myself in Desolation Row.  How I am almost drawn to tears when Dylan finally whales the harmonica at the end of that song.  In From a Buick 6, I can visualize him riding in that Buick. Was it a 6-up-straight? Or did they make only v-6's in those days? Who cares. But the prose and the rythm are haunting and beautiful all in one. <br />I haven't reviewed Blond-on-blonde in a while..maybe that is next.<br />John - 46
0792844793|5.0|\\"Blue Velvet\\" is one of the most intense flicks from our generation. Director David Lynch takes the pathetically naive and innocent and blends it with the completely demented and bizarre to create, in my opinion, the ultimate in modern-day film noir. Check this out: Frank Booth (Hopper) is a demented, drug-dealing, gender-confused kidnapper (with an oedipus complex) that has good connections. He takes Rosselini's husband and son and kidnaps them in exchange for .... favours...His bizarro posse includes Jack Nance (R.I.P.) as Bob, and Dean Stockwell as the ultra-suave Ben. MacLachlan is the curious & naive \\"young adult\\" that becomes curious on what gives when he finds an ear in the grass (sounds strange?). He manages to hook up with the investigating cop's daughter (Laura Dern) and begins a psychological menage a trois balancing good & evil! Lynch peaked with this film. Everyone who has a taste for the strange should own this!
6305364648|4.0|... The one thing that I didn't like was the crude language used in some scenes, particularly with the Erzats car salesman that had the hots for Ahnulds wife. This language was unnecessary to the storyline and appeared to be vulgarity for its own sake. \\"anything you can swear I can swear cruder.\\" I saw an LD of this flik as a demo of Dolby AC3 and was awed by the ability of the multi-channel surround sound to pinpoint locations. The warehouse sequence on the island when Jamie-Lee drops the Uzi on the steps had us ducking the flying slugs and the tinkle of the brass from the last round was right THERE on the floor to my right. Overall, the movie kept my interest to the end, stereotypes notwithstanding....
B000002WNP|4.0|this set is very nicely packaged and the remastering is top notch. so i leave u with this question. how in gods blue blazes can the leave out the song 'if i can dream'? of all the songs that really touched a chord with all the was going on in the 60's they have the nerve to leave this off the lineup. it really was a disappontment, which is why i give this set only 4 stars. someone at rca does'nt have a clue. very disapponting.
B0000027RL|5.0|Without blabbering on and on about how this album changed my view of music and started a revolution and [stuff] like that (which is all true), let me just say that this is one of the most essential CD's in my collection and were it ever damaged, I would immediately replace it no matter what the cost.  Nearly ten years old now, this one still lives in my CD changer.
B000001EAQ|1.0|I've been a big fan of u2 for years and I think that their 80s and early 90s material is really good such as albums like achtung baby and the joshua tree. Pop seems to be a weak attempt to recapture the time when their music was still groundbreaking and well written.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|It would be appalling to anyone to know that I had NOT written a review for this CD. Fiona Apple, once again, excels as a superb singer-songwriter, keyboardist with this her sophomore release. The haunting sounds of the chamberlain are once again present throughout the CD which give it that &quot;creepy&quot; undertone to all the tunes. Once again, the first cut feels displaced as it did in &quot;Tidal&quot;. And, once again, it feels like it's taken from a page from Alanis' songbook. The follow-up cut is a pseudo-latin syncopated, James Bond-soundalike little tune which wakes you up to what the rest of this CD is all about! Far better than &quot;Tidal&quot;, this CD presents her maturity (at least in songwriting) and the mastery of soul-singing. Even though she is the media's &quot;kickboy&quot;, don't let that affect you from purchasing this CD NOW! There is NOTHING in the market that sounds like this. This &quot;brat&quot;, like people call her, is talented, beautiful, and should proceed to the next level...film.
B000007U4U|5.0|I purchased this album when it first came out in the 70s, partly, it must be admitted, out of amusement at the name (coming from Hatfield, as I do). I have never tired of it in all this time, and even today, I can sit down and give it my undivided attention, and quite possibly pick up on something in it I never noticed before! Staggering musicianship (drummer Pip Pyle in particular), highly original composition, where the transitions between improvised and composed passages are almost seamless. When you consider how pompous and devoid of ideas a lot of the bigger prog. rock bands had become by the mid 70s, I suppose the punk &quot;revolution&quot; was by and large a good and necessary thing, but the simultaneous discrediting (by association) of the more &quot;left of centre&quot; artists such as the Hatfields, Henry Cow, Robert Wyatt etc. was an instance of throwing out the baby with the bath water, and really shouldn't have happened. This music deserves a revival.
B00003CXSM|5.0|This movie was excellent.  It has an excellent mix of humor and romance.  Jennifer Lopez does and absolutely fabulous job in this movie, as well as Matthew McConaughey.  The song during the ending credits didnt really fit, but I definitely recommend this movie to anybody.
B000001FS3|5.0|I'm writing this review as part of the process of designating all of the albums that I think deserve 5 stars.  In truth, there aren't enough stars in the galaxy to give this album.  It is truly U2 at their flag-waving, tearful, passionate best.  What matters, though, is that this is U2 at their musical, and lyrical best.  I would not only recommend this CD. I would question the judgement of anyone passing up the opportunity to own it.
0792842723|3.0|Goldeneye is the 17th movie in the legandary 007 saga stars Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. His perfomance was fantastic. He was a little rigid at times, but in my opinion is 007. However the case with the film is quit different. As an action movie it is spectaluar. As a Bond film, it lacks quite a bit.     As an action movie it is one of the '90's best. It plot is not rienforced, and is based around violence, there is no real character devolpment which makes it fun to watch. But it is not very memroable.    As a Bond movie it is NOT my favorite! It does follow the &quot;Bond Formula&quot; but the plot is based on pure action, there is no chacter devolpment(which I think is bad because after a six year abscence from the silver screen I would like to see how the character has changed. It also can drag. I recommened Tomorrow Never Dies (My FAVE!!!) but watch it and see for yourself. Move over SEAN, Brosnan =  Bond!
B00000K413|4.0|Great Debut by TFF. Basically no weak tracks which is saying a lot for a debut. In case any of you fellow TFF fans didn't know, Roland Orzabal has a new solo effort &quot;Tomcats Screaming Outside&quot; available on import only. Sounds real good.
0060245875|4.0|This is perhaps one of the best books my children and I have ever shared.  Laura Joffe Numeroff has a real winner on her hands, and not because of any particular medal or honor she has won in writing this book.  This book is a hit with KIDS!  I suppose I should say Kids of all ages because I loved this book and I am 34 years old!       The book is written in a circular fashion in that it begins with a mouse wanting a cookie and after the cookie: a glass of milk, a straw, a napkin, a haircut, a broom, and so on.  Each item he wants is associated with an action that takes place during his acquiring of an earlier item.  Eventually, the mouse will &quot;want&quot; his way back to glass of milk, and finally, a cookie.        What makes this playful tale such a hit with kids is that the mouse wants things that a child may ask for during the course of an afternoon or regular day.  It is slice of life for kids.  The illustrations of Felicia Bond show the mouse acting in ways a child might act.  This allows the child to be entertained and still connect with the book intellectually on his own level.  He can look at the book and say, &quot;Oh yeah - I've acted just like that standing in front of the regfrigerator when I wanted something to drink.&quot;  It shows the child something he knows about his world and about himself in a playful way.         Because of the circular style in which this tale is written , it allows the child to create anticipation and establish expectations in his reading or listening.  There is always a &quot;next&quot; in the list of things the mouse wants and they come quickly.  The child, then, does not get bored but listens intently to what that &quot;next&quot; will be.  The book brings the young reader full circle as well.  There is always a clear ending, sense of coming back to home base.  Once the book is well known, it might be read from middle to beginning just for fun.  Either way - it will bring the reader back around again - forming a secureattachment with the book and the way the tale is told.      This book can also be used as a way to inspire new ways to play.  Children may want to try to draw a circular story of their own.  A family with a flair for the dramatic may want to take turns acting out the part of the mouse after reading this book.  My children and I have even sat on the front porch and tried to come up our own versions of it: anything from &quot;If You Give a Squirrel a Peanut&quot; to &quot;If You Give a Kid a Quarter&quot;.        I highly recommend this book or any in Laura Joffe Numeroff's &quot;If You Give&quot; series.  Because of its memorable quality, and it's ability  to entertain and connect, it is amzaing what can happen &quot;If You Give a Child This Picture Book&quot;.
6303212379|5.0|The first time I saw this my friend practically had to pin me down and force me to. I thought I was too old for kiddy films anymore, but after seeing this, I'm rethinking that thought! The Goonies is a hilarious, cute, and attention-grabbing movie. The plot is an age old story: a few hardy boy type kids on a treasure hunt. Incorporated into the film is a little bit of romance, a little bit of terror, and a whole lot of adventure! After seeing this film i wanted to be a goony too and go on adventures with Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk, Brand, Andy, and Stef. Give this movie a chance, you won't regret it.
B000002A6N|5.0|I remember driving home from work on a rainy friday afternoon back in the summer of 76. When  &quot;More than a feeling&quot; came over the radio. I was in a complete state of shock and I had to pull the car over not to get in an accident. I knew then that the face of music wasn't going to be the same anymore. Even Ludwig, Amadeus, Chopin, Bach to name a few, would agree that this is a true masterpiece. Actually, I stored this album in the classical section of my record collection. This was by far the best thing to come out in that genre since the Beatle's Srgnt Pepper's album.
B000001DTM|5.0|No doubt about it, this was one of the premier releases of the 90's. Brilliant start to finish and includes the classics &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot;. Check out all the other cuts as well as they are all classics in thier own rights. As far as I am concerned, this or &quot;War&quot; is the best release ever by U2.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|While I can't help but dislike the first few songs on this album, the final seven more than make up for it.  To listen to the music of the Beatles evolve in quicktime is fantastic.  While they focus mainly on catchy beats at the beginning, the poetic quality of the lyrics become more and more evident by the time one reaches track 14.  And though repetitive and seemingly stupid, please, please, please, do not underestimate track 21--it's ridiculous, but in a good way.
B00000DG1R|5.0|What can I say about this album? Whether you are an 80's music lover or a Duran Duran fan, or you just like good music, you must have this album. It is by far one of the best compilations ever released. You get all Duran Duran's biggest hits in one nice package. To be honest, if you buy Greatest you do not really need any other albums by Duran Duran, you will have their best songs right here. The only other album that you should consider is Rio. I personally think Electric Barbarella is the best song on Greatest (I've never even heard it on the radio,) but all of the songs on here are great! Duran Duran's album Greatest is just that, the Greatest. Definitely five stars!!
B000002MUW|5.0|In my viewpoint, &quot;Bedtime Stores&quot; surpasses her 80s albums in its quality.  Undoubtedly, Madonna became a superstar with the release of chart-topping albums &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.  After the controversial &quot;Erotica&quot; which also shows her artistic diversity, Madonna released an album that proves her maturity as a songwriter and producer.  Among the 11 beautiful songs, &quot;Survival&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot;, &quot;I'd be Your Lover&quot;, &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot; are especially good.  Madonna was able to produce an excellent  R&amp;B album in such a short period of time after her 1993 tour!  Regrettably, her stardom wasn't at its peak during the release of the album in 1994.  It just reached Number 3 in the billboard chart.  But our fans and the history will remember this long-lasting album!  &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Stores&quot; are two Madonna albums that I like most!
B000001F3C|5.0|This c.d is just incredible, in particular for me, the first five cuts. I don't ever think I had up to that point ever heard such powerful music with such impassioned singing in my life.  My God I could feel Bono's pain as he sang &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; as if he were my best friend because of his vocal delivery. This is defintely one of releases that had a deep effect on me and is just incredible. I recommend this to any of the alt kids today who think the toxic waste they listen to is music.
B000002NBY|5.0|Paul Simon is rightfully a music legend.  From his earlier days with Art Garfunkel to his most recent works, he can be counted on to not only give the listener beautiful sounds, but words with meaning--a wonderful if not necessary change from today's pop.  Graceland is poetry at its finest, showing how Simon is willing to put artistic reasons ahead of what's popular.  Innovative, thought-provoking music with a point, this collection of some of the finest tunes around shows how the man making music thirty years ago is still strong.
0451197879|3.0|Roadwork is a novel with short snatches of interesting parts, buried in a whole lotta nothing. Some of the things just didn't make sense, and the unconscience dialogue form he mastered in his later novels detracts alot from the story. A colossal waste of time if you value plots that are thought out ahead of time, not just held together by chewing gum and string.
006092988X|5.0|I only started reading this book because it was required for my English class. The first 70 or so pages were very hard to get into but once I hit 100 I couldn't put it down! There are amazing characters in this book and when it ends you wish there was a sequel. I've read it twice in 3 years and will read it again in years to come.
B00005B4GU|5.0|You can almost interpret Kid A and Amnesiac as being all part of one big album; both require patience, in other words you can't expect to like the album after listening through it only once.  But relative to Kid A it can be described as slightly less influenced by techno and more influenced by some of Radiohead's earlier music.  Amnesiac opens with a track more in the style of Kid A, with very computerized drum beats, and very rhythmic synthesized chord progressions, even more electronic and dancable than the star track of Kid A, Idioteque.  But it is somewhat the black sheep of the album in that most of the other songs are more acoustic, guitar-oriented, with slow, haunting vocals.  But even this is an oversimplification.  The CD varies more from song to song than Kid A's general techno-chant trend, and even if you don't find it as beautiful and hypnotic as Kid A, it's a must get, and a necessity for expanding one's musical mind.
B00005A1PR|4.0|This artist is kind of hybrid of Tracy Chapman and Erykah Badu with her own blend of folksy R&amp;B music. As soon as I heard &quot;Video,&quot; I knew that I would buy this CD because the artist was speaking for all the forgotten sistas, the around the way girls who are happy with themselves even if they don't look like video chicks. So though that was the song that hooked me, track # 4 &quot;Brown Skin&quot; is my favorite on this CD. This song is a sultry ode to a fine brown skinned man (my favorite kind! 8-). I just like the mood on this song, and the lyrics are worthy of any mack as Ms. Arie flips the seduction scene on the brothas with words like &quot;Skin so brown, lips so round, baby how can I be down?&quot; I am determined to use that line on at least one man before the summer is over. lol. But seriously, this whole CD is good because the lyrics are substantial, but not pretentious or overwhelming. &quot;Strength, Courage and Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot; are also standouts on this collection. Check out Acoustic Soul for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
0316777722|5.0|Sedaris is a must (i'd underline must, but I can't so let's just pretend it is underlined) for anyone with an ironic sense of humor. He tells stories involving the period he spent in France with his boyfriend, and clearly outlines all the guidelines for choosing a boyfriend, all the while pointing out the stupity of situations in his own sarcastic way. The story involving his younger sister, and her flair for disguises, is worth the price of admission alone. Whether you are gay, straight, greek or polish, if you enjoy dysfunctional fun, Me Talk Pretty One Day is the book for you.
B00004Z400|4.0|I really do like this album, I am just becoming a deftones fan after buying this cd. I heard the song 'change' on mtv. and i liked it, but after i got the cd, i liked alot of the other songs alot better. this is definatly a must buy cd. i can do a reveiw of all the songs.<br />back to school-this is a good song, i like the guitar in it, defintatly one of the best<br />feiticeira- this is my third favorite song on the album, i think it should have been one of the singles.<br />digital bath- this is my favorite song on the cd, i like the way they make it sound like dripping water. very cool song<br />elite-this song kinda disapointed me because of the lyrics, and that is why i give this cd 4 stars<br />rx queen- i really liked this song, the intro drums are awesome, and the guitar riffs are kool too<br />street carp-i liked this song, shows what the deftones are made of<br />teenager-this is also a good song. although you might be surprised by the lyrics in it, not a normal deftones song<br />knife party-my favorite song on the cd, i like the screaming towards the end of the song<br />korea-i liked this song, but i cant listen to it too many times<br />passenger-this is a cool song, i like the way that chino moreno and james maynard from tool exchanged vocals back and forth<br />change(in the house of flies)- this is the song that made me buy this cd, i liked it alot, but i found out that alot of the songs on this cd are alot better than this, all in all this is a good song<br />pink maggit-this is not a bad song, i like the guitar in it, but its a little long, i cant listen to this song too many times either, almost identical to back to school
B00004VVNB|5.0|I remember first watching this movie when I was 7 years old.It put me in such awe back then and still does today.I believe this movie should have been credited with launching the age of the special effects not Star Wars.A 5 star masterpiece.
B000059GEI|3.0|OK a little history about this film. Marilyn Monroe had to make this film in order to go and then do The Seven Year Itch. Her costars Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey and evn Mitzy Gaynor report her being colod and aloof on the set. Marilyn was caught in an ubhaapy mariiage to Joe Dimaggio. She had not made a film in almost a year and on top of that she was playing yet again the gold digging blonde, and she was not a naturally born singer and dancer. However I think that she comes off the best in this film because of her absolute love affair iwh the camera. Hands down After y6ou get what you want You don't want it is a great number. AsIs Lazy with Mitzi Gaynor and Doold O' conner. Her acting is wooden, but so is eveyone else's in this film. Johnny Ray as priest!!! Yet, I have to say entertaining and fun to watch
6304007523|5.0|I recentley saw this movie for the first time, and I thought it was simply wonderful. I personally thought Rocky was a sweet, touching character. Some points of this film even made me cry. The script was well written and fresh, and the characters are more like real people and not blatant actors trying too hard to be memorable. I thought this movie was simply touching, and it sends out a good moral; if you never give up, you'll never be a loser. : ) I have yet to see the sequels, but all I can say is that its Oscar was well deserved and it's one of the best films of the '70s.
B000059GEH|3.0|Marilyn was quite funny in this film. This is the first time she was in control of her comic ability.
B000002U82|5.0|I will be seeing you on the dark side of the moon babey with prism crystals shining reflections through your back.  I will take my time and banish my money.  It will be just Us and Them.
B000005JA8|5.0|Pop music is better for the existence of this kind of music. From the opening notes of &quot;Bill's Corpse&quot; (with a great coda) to the funky bassline of &quot;Sweet Sweet Bulbs&quot; (my favorite track), this is the most adventurous album ever released (or is it unleashed?)on the public. Okay, the Magic Band's avant-garde and wild approach to rock/jazz/howlin' blues didn't yield them anything near chart success, but that's the whole point, this is music for open-minded, ingenius people. The last 32 years have done nothing to dilute the power and originality of this bold, groundbreaking recording. For some it may take a few dozen listens for it all to sink in. For others it simply won't make sense at all and they'll abanadon all attempts to understand it (too bad for them). Those of us with brilliant minds and truly open ears will not only get it right away, we'll become addicted! A Classic, Influential Recording.
630157401X|5.0|&quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; is a rollercoaster ride of a movie. More comedic than the other films, &quot;Last Crusade&quot; is a great conclusion to the trilogy. The film brings back the Nazis, this time searching for the Holy Grail. My favorite scene is the tank chase. The film is a perfect pairing between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO - BUY THE TRILOGY!!!
B00004T37H|5.0|What I love best about this movie is that it allows people to come to their own conclusions.  Not only is this wonderful to watch for its music and animation, but it also has a quality to it that the majority of movies today lack.  It makes you think.  There are so many intricate layers in this story that each time you watch it you catch sight of a few more meanings that you didn't see before.  If you have been disappointed with movies that seem to lack focus, or plot, or message, or if you are tired of watching regurgitated ideas that hold no more value than that which is on the surface, Princess Mononoke is the movie for you.
630575067X|4.0|Sure, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; isn't as good as the other movies, but it has its moments. The pod race, the three-way lightsaber duel, etc. I do believe that this is a great film, yet the weakest of the Star Wars films (don't get me wrong, there all great). Although it lacks Han Solo's sarcasim and cockiness, &quot;TPM&quot; is a diamond in the rough. For those of you that keep bashing this good film, get a life!!!
B000009O1U|3.0|This film is one of the last of the great hollywood epic films in the style of Samuel Goldwen. Heston is typically magnificent as El Cid and Sophia Loren as his love interest and then estranged wife Jimena. Strangely, I have never seen this film of television, unlike Ben Hur, Spartacus, and the rest of the titles that I think of in the same genera as El Cid. I was disappointed that the film used for the video I received was in such poor condition. It is &quot;pan a little and scan less&quot; and the images are dark and gloomy. The story is still a great adventure and still has a bittersweet ending. I hope that AMC, AFI,  or some other film restorer gets around to the master and that they release it to home viewing.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I thought this Cd was gonna be really poplike, because of pretty fly for a white guy, but luckily its not. The songs they chose to have played on the radio were a complete misrepresentation of this album. It's not the best because it has 3 or 4 songs that are pop, but aside from that it's great. Buy this one and don't listen to the radio songs.
B0000584V3|5.0|I have enjoyed all Opeth releases, however this is the best all round since Morningrise.  The production is great, due to the help from Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson (who also makes some guest appearances).  The overall continuity is great, Still Life somewhat dissapointed me in places, but this disc has not one flaw that I can hear.  There is nothing much that I can say other than this is essential listening.
B000059MEK|5.0|I've been listening to Daft Punk since '96 when i was into the whole phatpants/party scene.  They used to produce great tracks back then that got you pumped up, and were exhilarating to see live.  How fun was their 2nd going to be? I found this second album to be a new classic.  I really feel that it is one of the first electronic albums to really show that electronic music has a soul, a drive, a meaning, and an art to it.  This album harkens back to the days of those massive 60's &amp; 70's rock bands who had a theme or story that drove and influenced their whole album (think darkside of the moon, etc.).  Discovery is just like those albums.  If you have seen the videos for the first couple of tracks you know that DP is putting them out in the sequence of the album and that they all follow the same storyline.  When listening to the album you can imagine the rest of the space odessy for yourself.  This is not just an album, its a soundtrack, a ballet, a composition.  It has been expertly crafted to take you on a complete ride through different states of happiness, emotion, and funk.  We can only hope that they release the whole album/movie on DVD.  A milestone for electronic music.  We're here to stay, baby, and this album is one of the cornerstones.
B00001IVQT|5.0|The liner notes of the CD, by Bryce Morrison, speak for themselves.  I wouldn't disagree about one comma.  The technical explanation, for those who understand the musical terms are without fault. As a performance, it is  expression with complete regard for the Composer's intention--a quality of only the best performers.  Ashkenazy in his prime performing what may be the last great Epoch in the evolutionary chain of Piano Concertos.  Don't get me wrong, I love Ravel and Bartok and Stravinski--but we're talking about a true musical Epoch here.  Let's face it, there are not that many piano concertos that have withstood the test of time.  A few by Mozart, a few by Beethoven, the Schumann, the Grieg, a couple by Chopin and Tchaikovsky.  I'm sure I've left out a few--but still how many more are that memorable and haunting.  Rachmoninov was a rare being whose compositional virtuosity at the hands of a piano were unequaled--balancing complexities with melodic and harmonic content.  Rachmoninov in these two Concertos, inherited the true virtuosity of Beethoven--and aren't we lucky to have Ashkenazy to interpret these masterpieces.
B0000009RX|5.0|Zappa's mocking attack of the &quot;summer of love&quot; and its adherents' bloated self-importance might seem dated to some (I still find it very funny), but the satire of &quot;We're Only in it for the Money&quot; isn't really the point. Its strength lies in Zappa's command in the studio and his ability to piece together a huge patchwork of sounds into one wonderfully varied 39-minute work.<br />The 1968 release was Zappa's answer to the Beatles' &quot;Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot; which he lampoons on the cover. The Beatles' work had in turn been inspired by the Mothers' &quot;Freak Out.&quot; Whatever the difference between &quot;Money&quot; and the Lennon and McCartney's work, though, the two albums share one similarity: they both surprise with sound. Zappa's work includes patches of melody played backward, spoken words, doo-wop, surf music, hard-edged guitar, and a note held at the end of the tone poem &quot;The Chrome-Plated Megaphone of Destiny,&quot; which ends the album and provides Zappa's final comment to the closer of &quot;Sergeant Pepper's,&quot; the then-spooky &quot;Day in the Life.&quot;<br />The album nearly unrelentingly taunts the &quot;flower power&quot; generation, but its tones run deep. There is anger at the police, real insight into the gaps between parents and kids, and Zappa's ever-present love of plain absurdity. With the &quot;Chrome-Plated Megaphone of Destiny,&quot; he reveals his orchestral sense and his willingness to challenge his audience with a thoroughly free work. Zappa never condescended to his audience.<br />Zappa's music was always a great leavening agent to the reigning pomposities of the day. &quot;We're Only in it for the Money&quot; sears with satire but also amazes with the sound of surprise.
B00003CXN4|3.0|This movie had all the right ingredients, all-star cast, big-budget, capable director, promising plot...SO WHAT HAPPENED?  The only thing I found redeeming in this movie was Benecio Del Toro's performance. The script was too fragmented to develop much interest in anyone else. A lot of folks loved this movie, and it did have a gritty realism about it...I just wish I'd seen it BEFORE I made my purchase.
B00000099Y|5.0|Every so often, I get CDs that become part of my &quot;desert island collection.&quot;  You know, the albums that you absolutely would need to listen to if you were trapped on a desert island.  There is just so much to listen to on this CD, but also so much to to learn.  This album's best qualities are its lyrics.  The basic theme of the album is about opening up and looking at things a different way, and after listening to this CD, you may very well listen to modern rock music in a different way.  Complex rhythms, subtle yet powerful guitar playing, and vocals that somehow soar over all the monstrous sounds below.  Tool's song structure is also something worth mentioning.  I've never seen a band capable of playing one riff so many different ways and exploring which ways it can go.  Forty-six and 2 is basically the same riff over and over again, but it gradually changes, and by the time the song ends, you realize that its still the same riff, just another possibility for it.  But anyway, this is a superb album, a must for anyone who wants to learn something new from a rock CD.  It captures every mood and will leave you spellbound.
B00005AFVR|5.0|This album, like most of his concerts, leaves the Boss fans debating what songs should have been included. That was the way it was at every concert. Having seen Bruce a half dozen times on the last tour, I excepted the fact that he was not going to play Rosalita &amp; wondered what gem he was going to throw in that night. The Lost in the Flood tune is a great example. <br />Bruce &amp; The E Street Band rock and this album rocks. I agree with one of the reviewers and think Mansion on the Hill is taking up valuable space on this album. My vote for best missing song is Light of Day, which is the second half (after 10th Avenue Freezout) of his dedication to the power, the mystery, and the ministry of ROCK &amp; ROLL.
6305041156|5.0|I am giving this movie a 5star, BUT I have to complain about the DVD. OK, the image are pretty sharp but what a waste of space!! The entire movie is 2/3 up on the screen! Why, why??<br />With that aside,and with so many reviews before me, I will go straight to the point & say that 3 major characters that sticks on my mind is Kyaomi and Tango, the loyal fool and retainer , the 2 lost souls that drift along loyally with the great lord Ichimonji and Kurogane, the loyal henceman to lord Jiro.<br />Tango is wise and patient, while kyoami is childish, impatient and acid tongued, but their loyalty to the great lord till his last breath was extremely touching, and I cried during the funeral march. I don't see Kurogane as a \\"bad guy\\" but it is his loyalty that force him to kill. I cheered Kurogane twice, once when he give it good to lady Kaeda with the foxhead, and the second time when he removed her permanently.<br />The one I pitied the most is infact, the oldest son, Taro. He is naive and harmless , but used and manipulated by kaeda, killed by his own brother. Saburo is one tough little dude and he do just fine on his own.<br />I love Tatsuya Nakadai, and I noticed that his acting gets better and better the older he gets. Compare him in Yojimbo, Sanjuro...then watch him in \\"Kwaidan\\" then see him in Ran and differencr is amazing.<br />Kurosawa to me is one of the gods of cinema, second being Zhang Yimou of course.  And for anyone who loved Ran, I strongly suggest you try to catch all his other films particularly Yojimbo, Throne of Blood,  Seven samurai,...etc etc.
B00000IL1K|5.0|If La Luna was your first experience with Sarah Brightman (as it was with me), then Eden should be your second.  Sarah's vocals on this album are fantastic.  Her Italian version of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is one incredible song.  I like her version much more than the original.  This is an album that has great replay value and you will find yourself sticking in your CD player again and again...
B000059Z8J|5.0|It had been years since I had seen Superman.  So, I rented this one as a trip of nostalgia.  I was blown away by just how good this movie is so many years later.  Is there anyone more perfect to play the man of steel that Christopher Reeve?<br />Let this movie be a lesson to those who make movies like Spawn, Tomb Raider..., a movie must have more than explosions are special effects.  Superman is that movie.  It captures the grandness of childlike memories of superheroes without the use of  cliche.  <br />This is one to own for sure.  A super movie.
0553106635|5.0|How could anybody do this to faithful readers? After each book, we're left craving more, like junkies for a fix. I got the first two out of a library, intending to read the first one and finish the second after I came back from vacation. I ended up lugging the second book from the US to Asia, and the third book I'd gladly carry around for the rest of my life. Martin makes you cry, scream, and laugh, as characters the reader loves die ignobly and those you hated turn out to possess redeeming virtues. During this book, you almost forgive Littlefinger, you empathize with the Kingslayer, and you cheer (over and over and over) for the continued exploits of Jon (who is one of the best characters of the book). One note for the squeamish; don't finish the book right before you sleep... oh, what the heck, imitate me; pick it up at 9 PM, put it down at 3 AM. Somebody needs to stand over Martin with a whip and make him write the next three before the end of the year :-).
B00000J7JO|5.0|Is there any doubt that John Frusciante is the true heart and soul of RHCP?  His guitar work is so masterful and unique.  He has a style and a sound that, when you hear it, you know exactly who is playing.  Given that, Californication is a true throwback album for RHCP.  The songs are heartfelt and the music is top-notch.  <br />RHCP were lost in the mid-90's with many would-be lead guitarists.  Thank you, John, for centering yourself and this band once again.  I look forward to more great RHCP music!
B000002JB3|4.0|And Lorenzo, and Just Another Story, and... even if ya don't like the other songs, which aren't even taht bad, buy it for the 3 I named.
B000056NX4|5.0|I never saw any version of Jesus Christ Superstar before I watched this essential filming of the stage version on PBS, and I loved what I saw!  Glenn Carter performs an alright Jesus: few facial expressions, but when he acts he acts well, and his voice makes up for some of it.  Renee Castle is a touching Mary Magdalene, and Fred Johaneson is terrific as Pilate.  Tony Vincet really stole the show, though!! He is a terrific singer and great actor, and it is a shame he was cast as Judas only on Broadway and not in the film.  Onto Jerome Pradon's Judas... I saw Jerome Pradon in Whistle Down the Wind on London and I swear I am not making this up- he hit every note and his voice didn't crack.  Acting-wise, he is terrific and evokes much sympathy in his tragic role.  But the singing... However, I did read an interview with Pradon in which he said that he was asked to play Judas as part of the London cast, but he turned it down because he claimed he was absolutely not a tenor and could not sing the part.  I wish the directors had listened!  This is definitely an amazing musical that will change your perspective on musical theater, religion, and Really Useful's cast choices.
B00001ZULV|5.0|This CD is great for beginner fans. Trying to make a new fan understand The Lamb is not an easy task. If you're interested in Genesis, give this a listen and you'll find out a lot about their sound.
6303168507|1.0|It makes me very sad that people so love Steven Spielberg movies.  Spielberg only makes movies about the most simplistic emotions in the most simple ways.  Most of the time it boils down to a child's feeling of fear running away from a monster.  Is there really any difference for Spielberg between running from a killer shark or a killer dinosaur or a killer Nazi?  I don't think there is.  Showing bad things happening to people and saying, &quot;Here's a great holocaust movie&quot; is so insulting.  It's the worst thing one can possibly do to take something very complicated and through propogandistic techniques (cutting between party scenes and scenes of suffering etc.) make it look simple.  I beg you not to go for the cheap and easy way out.
B000002J1S|4.0|This is the album for you. It's a concept album about Rael, you goes through different worlds and stuff. It's really weird.
0553212737|5.0|Marvelous! Incredible! Amazing! Wonderful! That about sums it up right there. It was a great book. I t kept you in on going suspense on who was going to marry who. It tied up all the ends and it made you want to leap for joy at how happy things turned out. I definitely would give this book to you if you asked me &quot;What is the best book on earth.&quot;
B000002IG4|4.0|This CD has some really good songs on it, especially Like China, Do You Know Do You Care, Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away (this one makes me wanna cry!) and Why Can't It Wait Til Morning (this one too!). You gotta buy it!
0451526295|2.0|Definitely one of Jane Austen's worst books. At the beginning you think ...What?!!  At the middle you think... Pretty good!  But by the end you think... Give me a toilet so I can flush it down!!!!!!!!! You wait the ENTIRE book for something that happens in the last 2 pages. I quit 3 pages before the ending positive that Fanny would never get married. But then my sister said, &quot;You just have to be patient.&quot; Then I told her that I had been patient for the last 384 pages and I certainly was not going to &quot;be patient&quot; any longer! Well I was patient and finished it, but I must confess I no longer know where the book is. Because when you turn around and throw a book into a cramped toy room. It is incredibly hard to find.

6304508611|5.0|Though perhaps more of a drama than what passes for horror by today's standards, CARRIE stands out as one of the genre's finest moments, having been made in a decade that also saw other classic thrillers such as JAWS and HALLOWEEN.<br />Based on Stephen King's first novel, the film is in essence a character study revolving around a socially repressed high school student (Sissy Spacek) who is tormented at school by her uncaring peers and at home by a religiously fanatical mother (Piper Laurie).  She soon discovers, however, that she has telekinetic powers; and when a horrible prank is pulled on her during the school's senior prom, those powers are unleashed with horrible and tragic results.<br />Brian De Palma's superb, Hitchcock-inspired direction mostly avoids the blood and gore until the bitter end; even the nightmarish prom scene is never explicit in its violence.  But CARRIE really succeeds as both horror and drama because of Spacek's incredibly devastating performance in the title role.  We sympathize with her situation, even as we shudder at the kind of horror she causes in the finale.  Her performance got her nominated for a Best Actress Oscar in 1976 and it can be argued quite convincingly that she should have won.<br />For those who appreciate horror with a certain amount of drama, not to mention heart, CARRIE is essential, classic viewing.
B000002I8D|4.0|This album kicks! It's got one of the best songs out there, You Know What I Mean. It's also got In The Air (which is NOT about someone drowning, :sarcastic: thank you Eminem), and Behind The Lines. Awesome album.
6304416415|5.0|Wayne Szalinski is convinced he has figured out a way to shrink the size of matter.  It works great on paper, but he can't make it work in real life.  While he's at a conference presenting his ideas, the machine accidentally shrinks his and his neighbor's kids.  When they get thrown out with the trash, they must journey across the backyard, avoiding bugs, sprinklers, and lawnmowers.  Meanwhile, Wayne and his wife try to fix the machine and find the kids.  Will they find them before it's too late?  Can Wayne figure out how to make the machine work to reverse the process?<br />This is one of my favorite movies.  It combines a great story and great characters with great special effects.  All the characters grow because of their experiences, even both sets of parents.  The special effects still hold up today, and are there to tell the story, not the other way around.  The story moves effortlessly from comedy to drama and back again.<br />It's a shame that there aren't more movies like this.  Gather the entire family together and enjoy a great family film.

B000000Y27|5.0|There is probably none who has done more for jazz guitar than Wes Montgomery, except maybe Charlie Christian. Listening to this album you can hear why this man has influenced nearly every guitarist that has ever picked up an axe. Montgomery's style of play came about from playing late at night when his family was in bed. He used his fingers to keep the guitar quiet, and his trademark sound was born. <br />This album showcases some great songs from the master of the jazz guitar. The album opens with \\"Airegin\\", an upbeat tune that shows off some great chord comping and powerful melodic runs. \\"D-Natural Blues\\" intros with \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", but turns into run after run of powerful soloing from Montgomery. The quietly soulful \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams\\" is nothing but beautiful. His solos are full of the octave-doubled notes that give his sound such a rich color. <br />Even though Montgomery is gone, he still lives on not only through his own music, but through the music of others that have been touched by him. His soulful and innovative way of playing the guitar has earned him much respect in the guitar and jazz world. If you're a guitar fan, you owe it to yourself to check out Wes Montgomery, and this album is a good place to start.
B000002MUQ|5.0|There is a LOT of debate as to which singer best fits Van Halen's style of guitar and music.  After three singers, the debate is as evil as ever.  My piece of advice: WHO CARES?<br />Balance is a landmark album in the Rock genre.  Songs like &quot;Can't Stop Lovin' You&quot; and &quot;Big Fat Money&quot; show that Eddie and gang still have what it takes to put out good hard rock.  What really makes the album for me is the wonderful set of ballads.  I really can't say enough about &quot;Not Enough.&quot;  This song has almost religious meaning to me (ALMOST).  <br />If you're reading this review, then that means you are thinking about buying this album.  Off the top of my head, I can't think of any reasons why you shouldn't.  Sell your car, your house, even your significant other (I wish) and buy this highly essential piece of music.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This cd is a perfect example of what happens when bands get to cocky with there money.  I remember first hearing Limp Bizkit in a skate park back in like '94 when they were nothing.  Ill admit I thought the first album was the most origial thing I had ever heard back then.  I waited the release of Significant Other, and was disapointed. I would at least think they would change a couple of things to gain back there momentum for there next album.  I was wrong.  This cd just showes how mainstream this band has gone.  Now and days you cant walk down a street without seeing a 8 or 10 year old thinking there hard-core wearing limp bizkit t-shirts and red hats.  Not just that but the cd its self is horrible.  Not one good mosh song on here.  And this Chocolate Starfish thing is just plain weak.  Who wants to go around promoting a lame name such as Chocolate Starfish and Hot Dog Flavored Water.  I mean its really sad.  This band could have been way more, but this is the final nail in the coffin for anyone who wanted the old school Bizkit to do a second album.<br />Jeers to Fred and Limp Bizkit.   Jeers to this album.
B00004R99J|5.0|To anyone expecting a historical and accurate presentation of envents, look elsewhere. But then why are you looking at Disney films in the first place? They are famous for sugar-coating fairy tales and myths, why should historical stories be any different? <br />That said, Pocahontas is a surprisingly real story even if it's events are complete fiction.  It's characters feel like real people, and the events are both tragic and inspiring, and, yes children, not all endings are happy.<br />What's wonderful about Disney is how they can make a heart-wrenching tale such as this and still include light moments that don't seem totally out of place.  The cute animal antics are great and show that animals don't need to talk to be funny. Such constant prescenses and Grandmother Willow and Wiggins add comic relief to what would normally be only serious situations.<br />The story is classic and teaches a good lesson. Who cares if it's historically accurate? Leave that for the history books to tell!  Disney's calling it historical merely indicates that it is BASED on history in the way that The Little Mermaid was BASED on a fairy tale. And I don't need to remind you that Ariel commited suicide in Anderson's original tale.<br />Anyhow, many people I know don't like this film cause it's too serious.  Most of the guys I hang around with need a good fight scene or perhaps an explosion before they'll acknowledge a film's greatness. Also the humor is a lot more subtle in Pocahontas than in many Disney films.  Others like the film but not the ending.<br />To me, Pocahontas is a masterpiece of artistic creativity. Sure it's historical balderdash, but it's a great story, has great characters, and has more depth than many live-action films today. While it is not my favorite of the recent Disney movies, it's a great one, and I love to see them trying different things!
0671034065|2.0|I rather enjoyed Linda Howard's &quot;After the Night&quot; so I decided to follow it up with &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot;. As a romance it makes an okay beach novel, but the mystery/suspense aspect is laughable.<br />After Jaine and her friends compile a list of attributes that would make the perfect man, someone tries to kill them off one by one. First of all, the idea that anyone would be interested in this list that someone else wrote, much less be so offended by it that they would be moved to kill, is ludicrous. Also, maybe I've read too many suspense novels but I figured out who the killer was way too early. Still, Jaine is an interesting character and she's got good chemistry with her next door neighbor, Sam. Read it for the romance but if you're a mystery fan (or even a romantic suspense fan) skip it.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Ok, I know this is not the greatest film ever. I couldn't decide whether to give it 3.5 or 4 stars, but because I am a big fan of the series, I'll be generous. Jar Jar Binks? Yes, we could do without him. And yes, some of the acting is a bit dry. But come on, for any fans of Star Wars that know the characters, know the story, and just know the Star Wars galaxy, this is a great film to watch. The podrace is just incredible, and if that is not enough for you, you will LOVE the lightsaber duel between the Jedi and the sith at the end. The characters are well introduced into the Star Wars world with maybe the exception of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Loyd is not all that good in this film). But Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are all very good.<br />The DVD is loaded with extras that I'm sure will enhance this spectacle. I plan on getting it when it comes out and I'm really looking forward to seeing the cut scenes and documentaries. Bottom line- It's not as good as the original Star Wars, but it works.
0446677450|5.0|This book really has changed my entire outlook on my financial situation. So many times while reading it, I thought &quot;Dang, that's me exactly&quot;. I am much more confident now about my financial future than I was before.<br />I know some reviewers wanted examples, I did too, but then I got to thinking that, had the author provided examples, less people would be helped by the book. as with all things, there are many ways to gain wealth, and they come and go, outdated examples would only lead people to make poor choices and hurt themselves. While I do wish I had some examples and how-to's to work with I'm happy with just the coneptual understanding, I'll find the how-to's on my own.<br />I've ordered his other books as well. Hope they're as insightful.
B000002TPS|5.0|With 'Youthanasia' Megadeth gave their music a makeover and it paid off. Every track on the album has a fantastic sound with top cuts being 'Train Of Consequences', 'A Toute Le Monde' and 'Addicted To Chaos'.<br />For hardcore Megadeth fans it may take some getting used to but not much becasuer the quality of the music shines through no matter what your perspective on the new style.
B00004VVNB|4.0|Logan's Run is a dazzling sci-fi film. It is set in a very &quot;alien&quot; future of the United States; only everyone is forced to live indoors in a &quot;City of Domes.&quot; Society is peaceful and fun loving. When you reach 30, you are to renew your life through a ritual or never live again.<br />The story of Logan's Run is quite frightening. Director Michael Anderson does a fantastic job of keeping the frightening aspects of the story going. From the pleasant yet somewhat menacing voice of the main computer to the idea behind the &quot;Carousel&quot;, you never for a minute doubt what is going on and you really pull for the central characters.<br />The DVD transfer is good, probably as good as they are going to get, because some scenes of the film always looked a little &quot;muddy.&quot; The enhanced soundtrack is in Dolby and while not 5.1, is still sounds much better than the VHS. The commentary is good but nothing spectacular. And the widescreen is really nice!<br />A word of caution. While the film is rated PG, there are several scenes of brief nudity, one of which really doesn't further the plot any and is unnecessary (in fact, in the commentary, the scene takes the director by surprise and he says he forgot about it). The other is an elaborate scene in the &quot;love shop.&quot; Despite that, there is very little graphic violence and little to no profanity.<br />Logan's Run is a solid film. It looks a little dated now, but still entertains!

B00003CX9E|5.0|That is the point?  None, the world might as well end as the release of this DVD will be the end all  of everything.  Not only is it significant in the relm of cinema, ranking highly on many lists, is deserves all the acclaim.  I will gladly purchase this DVD if all it had was a miserable transfer from a fifty year old print.  The fact that there are many wonderful extras makes this the only disc you have to buy this year.  If you are a film fanatic or a Simpson's fan, you must own this DVD!
0684857820|4.0|Usually I avoid books like this-it's just so hard to connect with the whole concept of being raped if you're a man with no history of being violent or with being a victim of violence (though I was robbed at gunpoint and bashed over the head with a pistol once).  Anyway, I was given this book by my sister who told me that it wasn't the ususal ... and that I would really get caught up in this most unusual of memoirs.  My sister was right.<br />The opening 40 or so pages of Ms. Sebold's book are amazing--you are drawn into this very personal and painful memoir with hooks straight our of the best crime fiction--Ross MacDonald and James Ellroy fans take note!  And as she dips back into her childhood and adolescene in the first one-third to one-half of the book  Miss Sebold paints with seemingly disjointed anecdotal meories a portrait so vivid it simply amazes me.  Miss Sebold is a helluva story teller--can't wait for some fiction from this writer.<br />\\"Lucky\\" loses steam in the last third of the book--after the rapist is tried and convicted.  In telling of her last three years of college and the decade of debauchery (heroin and indiscriminte sex) that follows, Miss Sebold uses the same techniqes that make the first half of the book so powerful, but they fall flat here and just don't  have the ring of \\"truth\\" or any sense of urgency--the book is just playing itself out. A violent scene where Miss Sebold's companion is brutally beaten while trying to \\"cop\\" some heroin on the lower east side of New York just leaves me empty--I have no feeling one way or the other and no empathy at all for either Miss Sebold or the boyfriend we don't even know--perhaps this is the point, but it just doesn't work for me.<br />Still, it was wonderful to read this book and reassuring that a memoir of a brutal rape doesn't have to be a feminist diatribe.<br />Good job, Miss Sebold--I can't wait to read more!
B00000J2L8|5.0|Some one wrote that this was a &quot;fun movie and a great parody on the government&quot;, what they really meant was that this movie is a great diagram of how governments are run and the people who run them and what they are like.  Some times the absurd is the real and what we think or laugh at is the reality that we live with, but we hope, we pray for sanity, yet all we get is that which we see on the big screen, its not a parody its real.

B00005LMBK|5.0|People are complaining about buying this album after seeing the &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; video.  HA!  Thats what you get for thinking that one video is a fair sample of an entire album.<br />This album is pure joy, but is nothing like the &quot;Clint&quot; single.  This hasn't even been out for a year, and allready I crave the next one (if there is to be one).<br />For an experemental side-project, the boys really put it together tight!  I've always been a huge blur fan, as well as Del the Funky Homosapien.  Having them together is just pure joy.
6301967992|5.0|Yes, I know, this is a very old movie. But it's timeless too. Roman Polanski shows us his genius, with a kind of &quot;B&quot; movie feeling floating in the air, you end up with our friends &quot;professor Ambronsius and his faithful disciple (played by Roman himself)&quot; in a tavern in a small &amp; gloomy region of Europe. I really don't want to tell much about the story without giving it away, but the adventures these guys go through trying to save the world from these blood suckers are simply hillarious. Just let me talk about the increadibly funny people in this movie: <br />Prof. Ambronsius - Clueless Einstein look-alike, just too funny<br />His disciple (Roman) - The perfect clumsy side-kick (very natural, not overacted).<br />The tavern owner - A little horny jewish guy who's always after his beautiful employees.<br />Tavern owners wife - A very ugly and rough jewish lady who's constantly after her husband, trying to catch him red handed.<br />Count Dracula - A perfected Bella Lugosi, which makes it funnier.<br />Draculas son - He's gay (he doesn't bite women, so Roman is in the menu)and very pompous.<br />Need to say more? Just get this movie, you will not regret it. It's simply a classic.
0780020693|3.0|&quot;Amarcord&quot; is a &quot;plot-less&quot; movie, that goes from one story to another. There brief episodic scenes, that when they're all added up you have a movie that made you laugh, had a little heart, and perhaps maybe made you relive your past as well. In my opinion &quot;Amarcord&quot; is Fellini's most charming film. Even though films like &quot;8 1\2&quot; , &quot;La Strada&quot;, and &quot;The White Sheik&quot; are great movies, this one carries something special with it. Nearly everything about this movie is a delight. Fellini's directing is great. The music by Nino Rota has to be my favorite thing about the whole movie! Maybe this sounds odd to some, to actually say you enjoyed the music in a movie more than the movie itself, but, if you've ever seen this movie, you'll understand. The cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno is very good as well. Fellini has been quoted as saying this movie is not autobiographical, but, does relate to some moments in his childhood. Well, whether the movie is or isn't autobiographical it's still a pleasure to watch. The movie for the most part follows Titta (Bruno Zanin) and his family. We see the way his family is, the scene at the dinner table makes me laugh everytime, unfortunately it's like watching my own family, and how sad is that! lol. We see his friends at school, and we even get to hear his confession, which was providing a little bit more information than I really needed to know  lol. Look, there's not much more I could add that other's haven't already. If you've never seen a Fellini movie, this would be a good place to start. If your already a Fellini fan, why have you waited to see this? Again, not Fellini's best film, but, his most charming.
0671027573|5.0|Linda Howard has outdone herself this time! You will not be disapointed with this one, I loved the humor in Mr. Perfect. Even though the story took a serious turn, the humor kept it going.  If I were to describe the neighbor in this book one word comes to mind...YUMMY!
B000056K04|4.0|Everyday is another enjoyable cd by DMB, but it doesn't have nearly the same impact as their other albums. The hooks are strong, the guitars are edgy (I like &quot;I Did It&quot; unlike many fans), and they branch into some interesting new world music with &quot;Mother Father&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot;.  Unfortunately, many of the songs are too poppy and lack their normal complexity and instrumentation.  Leroi Moore's sax shows up only in short simple bursts and Boyd Tinsley's violin is mostly used as symphonic background noise.  It sounds like Dave with backing musicians.  It is still a good addition to their catalog but definitely not the place to start.<br />On the other hand, The Lillywhite Sessions is a dark, introspective masterpiece with great instrumentation from the entire band.  Get it if you can still find it on the Internet.  If not, find a friend who already downloaded it.  5 Stars!
B00005B4GU|5.0|I think that Radiohead deserve praise for continuously pushing musical boundaries. Personally, I have seen my musical taste develop as a result of following the band's development. I believe that if you are standing still it equivalent to going backwards. Radiohead always seems to be moving forward with their musical ambitions and that is good for music.
B000056K04|4.0|OK, all you DMB fans watch out, sharp turn left straigt ahead.  DMB broke the mold with this one, and while progressiveness is good, I'm not sure if this is a sign of development, or just change for change's sake.  For those who remember the good ole &quot;under the table and dreaming&quot; days, you'll like &quot;Father Mother&quot; and &quot;Dreams of our Father.&quot;  For those ready to move on past ants marching, &quot;I Did It&quot; is a real rocker.  All the rest of the tracks will take a couple spins to get used to.  But, in the end, I would say get used to it. The tracks grow on you, and have a nice groove to them.  Besides, DMB has a real tendency to be the trendsetters, not followers, so they might set the pace for what we will be hearing from other artists in the not so distant future.

0743216458|2.0|A rather silly and superficial telling of a military group of paratroupers. Names come and go and an officer named Winters is idolized. He doesn't drink, doesn't curse, kills Germans by the dozens and even takes time to comfort new replacements. Save your money and check out the TV series.
B00000IQC8|5.0|The story of the making of Clerks is outstanding. It is amazing that the young filmaker Kevin Smith would risk making a movie that no one might see, and be drowned in credit card bills for years. &quot;Clerks&quot; cost under thirty thousand dollars, which would be peanuts to any film production company. Smith was in the habbit of collecting credit cards, so he charged all of the expenses to those. He hired some actors and used lots of his friends in the making of the movie. The Quik Stop that was used in &quot;Clerks&quot; was actually the place that he worked at. The film is really based off his experience as a worker there.<br />&quot;Clerks&quot; is the story of a full day in the job of a store clerk. Dante Hicks(Brian O'Halloran) is called into work on an off day, and because he always gives in, he agrees to come in on the basis that he will be able to leave by twelve. Right when he gets to work, his problems begin. First off, the shades for the windows will not open because some punks jammed the locks with gum. He therefore has to remind customers that the store is now open, with the sign: I ASSURE YOU WE ARE OPEN. <br />He is then harassed by such customers as a cigarette hater, who rallies the cigarette buying customers against the seller of the cancer sticks. Randal(Jeff Anderson), who works next store in the video shop, spends more time doing his own thing instead of working. He also hangs out with Dante and takes pride in heckling the customers that make him tick, and there are many. <br />The customers that come into the Quick Stop are extremely wierd. One guy is obsessed with finding the perfect dozen of eggs, and on top of that, there are the milkmaids, the girl who obviously can't read, and a strange old man who is interested in adult magazines. <br />There is really no plot, but just an unusual day in the life of a store clerk. Dante is a college dropout, and his girlfriend tries to push him back into school. He really likes her, but he has trouble with the type of things that she has done with past boyfriends. He has gotten the news that his old girlfiend is getting married, and he becomes jealous.<br />Jay and Silent Bob: Possibly the funniest duo in a comedy. The pair are drug dealers, but they have trouble selling their product. Jay shoots his mouth off, steals, and marks his spot right in front of the Quick Stop. Silent Bob is just about the exact opposite. It is true that he marks his spot in front of the Quick Stop with Jay, but he does not speak. This may be to give what he finally does say some sort of insightment. The pair are played by Jason Mewes and the director himself; Kevin Smith. Kevin originally was going to play the part of Randal, but he didn't want to juggle director duty and play a part with so many lines, so he opted to play the non speaking role. Jay and Silent Bob are the funniest part of the movie, mainly because of the way that they are suited for each other. Jay calls Silent Bob his heterosexual lifemate.<br />&quot;Clerks&quot; was originally NC-17 not for nudity or violence, but for the language which describes various sexual situations in great detail. It grossed 3 million in theaters for Miramax and they had bought it for 227,000 dollars. Therefore, it was a giant success. &quot;Clerks&quot; is not about achieving a certain visual style as it is with many films, but about the conversations and relationships between the characters. The production of &quot;Clerks&quot; and the film itself should serve as a standard to other independent filmakers who are out there trying to make it in an already overcrowded business.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I thought that this movie was completely amazing! The scenery, the acting, the special effects, the action.....phenominal. Now I know why it won an Oscar for Best Picture. And Russell Crowe, ahhh!, he just portrays his character with such brilliance! Its wonderful! I recommend this DVD to anyone who loves blood, gore, and action as well as a twisted love story! I loved every single aspect of this film!
B000002TQV|5.0|Most peoples' introduction to Radiohead was through the anthemic rock song 'Creep' from their first album. Despite its huge success, the hype around the release of 'The Bends' was somewhat minimal. However it has come to be one of the greatest albums of our time, crossing Pink Floyd's experimentalism with gentle acoustic indie and straight-ahead rock sensibilities.<br />From spacey opener 'Planet Telex' to the soothing, intoxicating 'Street Spirit (Fade Out) we feel Radiohead through and through on the album. The album is nice and varied. The riff from 'Just' sounds like it walked straight out of a Nirvana song, before going into what should have been a Creep-sized anthem. Meanwhile The Bends is lo-fi guitar rock. I especially love the voice and drums only passage. It sounds very close to you.<br />This is the opposite of the distant closer Street Spirit, with its repetitive guitar line, jazzy drums, soothing vocals and melancholy strings. <br />Other highlights include High And Dry (which you are bound to know) with its strasospheric sound, Fake Plastic Trees, with its longing melancholia and the sleazy Bones. In fact, nothing on the album is bad! <br />The Bends is without doubt one of the most influencial albums of the 90s, from hard rockers to gentle indie people. To do that, it is without doubt a classic.
0792841344|4.0|I remember when this movie first came out! It was different, and you really didn't know what the hell was going on, at first!

0060955775|4.0|My wife, who is an avid reader of fiction, gave me this book to read and said I might like it.  She was right on the money.  It is an excellent read.  I don't like grim tails unless either I or the main character learn a great deal.  This is no grim tale. Don't be put off by the title.  This book is illuminating in what we can all do in our 70-100 years on this planet.
B00004Z400|4.0|The Deftones are a good band and some of their songs are just flat out awesome and some are just flat out dumb.  so since both cancel each other out i came up with a final 4/5 stars.  I haven't heard their others so i could check those out.  hope the next is better.
B00005LOLD|5.0|When I mention the film Sayaonara to anyone who likes a good flick, the first thing they say is &quot;never heard of it&quot;. Then I lend it to them and and they are simply speechless! Sayonara is a film that made such a strong impression on me the first time I saw it some 15 years ago, that I never forgot it and till this day I can recall the dialogue, scenery, and characters like it was yesterday. This film has always been a favorite of mine. I have a soft spot for a well made epic love story and the plot of a G.I. in a foregin land falling for a mysterious and beautiful woman. Then the realization of both  characters knowing that their love may not be possible and may cause nothing but anguish and harm is simply amazing and heart felt! This film is up there with the &quot;Love Is A Many Splendored Thing&quot; (AND THAT MOVIE IS AMAZING!!!) as a total tear jerker. The scene where brando must follow Japanese custom and remove his shoes in his lovers house for the first time is just an all around exhale of human emotion. I cry till this day and can't wait to cry over the film in a more clearer transfer of the characters facial expressions of their emotions on screen-a CLASSIC!
6305842442|5.0|Great movie. Not only for its visual effects, but also it's story line. There is so much symbolism and in depth analytical items in which to bring forth from watching this film. A true masterpiece and one which I can always enjoy, I absolutely love it. My favorite scene is near the end when Deckert is being chased. It is magnificent! Truly, whether you have heard it was bad or good, you should go watch it. To just get the knowledge of this film in incredible.
0060278234|5.0|Lirael doesn't feel like a daughter of the Clayr. In fact as years past she felt farther and farther away from ever being  one. She doesn't even look like a Clayr OR have the only thing important to her-the Sight.          Even worse she was destined to save the Old Kingdom which made her yet even more farther away from where she just wanted to fit in and be like every other daughter of the Clayr. Now she must undertake an important mission with only her best friend the Disreputable Dog to help her along the way.<br />'Lirael' is a wonderfully done novel by Garth Nix! He has the talent of capturing you right away into this book and it's like you feel and experience everything that the characters do. I can't express how disappointed I was when it ended and having to wait for the sequel 'Abhorsen'. Garth Nix took you into a new and capturing world in 'Sabriel' and now he introduces you to new places and intrances you deeper into the discovery of the Old Kingdom. When I first started this book I thought that their was no way Garth Nix can replace any of the characters in 'Sabriel'. He proved me wrong! He adds in new spectacular characters and former characters as well. If you read 'Sabriel' and enjoyed it get this one right away! It's worth spending the extra money for the hardcover.
6305807086|5.0|This should have been nominated for more Academy Awards and won more. This was a very smart, funny, and creative movie. Cameron Diaz was awesome as a person who you would never expect her to play so well. Great performances by Joh Cuack and Malkovich, too....
B000003N8R|5.0|Sandwiched between two of the John Coltrane Quartet's greatest masterpieces -- Live at Birdland and A Love Supreme -- Crescent is often forgotten.  But this album of four ballads and one blues is full of understated beauty.  &quot;Crescent&quot;, &quot;The Wise One&quot; and &quot;Lonnie's Lament&quot; are three of the Coltrane's most beautiful compositions; these are some of the first ballads in the later Coltrane style, with the saxophone playing the theme in free time over the rumbling rhythm section.  (There's a great 50 minute performance of &quot;Crescent&quot; on Live in Japan, but that's not for everyone.)  The mood on this recording is similar to that on Ballads but Coltrane cuts loose a bit more.  His playing can get intense at times, but it doesn't have the shrieks and screams which pop up on A Love Supreme and later albums.  &quot;The Drum Thing&quot; is basically an excellent Elvin Jones solo, with Jimmy Garrison's bass providing forward motion and Trane's saxophone wrapping around the rhythm section.  If you liked A Love Supreme, this is an excellent choice for your next Coltrane album.
B00005K9LM|5.0|I think this is best Priest album ever and even more, best  metal album ever made. New track is bad, but originally tracks are fine. BRUTAL, RAW and MELODIC same time. Such good ideas, playing and Rob`s voice.<br /> I have 2000 records and i have listened music 25 years and still I keep &quot;defenders...&quot; one of the greatest master pieces of human kind. Every song is worth of listening. BUY IT! We in Finland know what is best :)
B0000028RR|5.0|This is true classic. The album is in my oppininon the best Rage album. Tom Morello is the best guitarest out there right now. The sounds he can make on a guitar are uncomparable. He also has some great solos (especaly live) which proves hes not all pedals and effects. Hes sort of like a dj on guitar. Zach De La Rocha has a unique voice and powerful and meaningful lyrics. Tim C.(bass) and Brad Wilk (drums) are very overlooked because the power the other two put out but are genuine tallents. Zach's lyrics say a lot of important things that need to be heard. Allthogh I don't agree with some of the stuff he says America is too one viewed and needs to hear other ideas. They are one of the best rap/metal bands out there. The album starts out powerfuly with \\"Bombtrack\\" althogh lyricly not the best a very good song. \\"Killing in the Name\\" is one of the best songs and has a real good guitar solo in it. The lyrics are repetitive but I guess thats what this type of song needed. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS ALBUM!!!
0393317552|4.0|Diamond's book is both an ambitious look at 5 million years of human history (in only about 430 pages)(plus copious notes), and an extended and elegant plea for history to come into consideration as a science and not merely a &quot;humanities&quot; area of study.         Not being an historian or an anthropologist, I came to this book a complete layman, and I must say I learned a lot.  Diamond has a clear style that makes even some of his more far-reaching theories accessible.  I was frustrated by the way he &quot;glossed over&quot; opposing theories, but it makes complete sense as (a) if he didn't, his book would be MUCH longer, and (b) that's what all the bibliographies and notes in the back are for.  There are plenty of paths left for the curious mind to follow other avenues of research.         Diamond's basic premise is that Western European societies eventually came to colonize and establish dominant cultures across a vast swath of the planet due to geographic and agricultural factors, not due to any inherent superiority of Europeans.  It is one of those hypothoses that most people will listen to and say, &quot;Well, DUH.&quot;  It makes sense - but how well can we explain WHY it makes sense?  This book does that.  It is a good study in how to apply critical thinking even to things that seem self-explanatory.         He does tend to repeat himself a lot, but boy howdy does it get those ideas stuck in your head.  He makes a point, demonstrates why it is so, makes it again.  It's a good, solid book and a fascinating perspective on the whole of human history.  I recommend it.
0440219078|5.0|After reading a few of the other reviews for this book, I realize how great this book really is because of the lessons it implies, but mostly because of the audience the book has the power to touch.   Written for children, this Newberry award winner is a truly wonderful story.  Similar to the classic &quot;Brave New World,&quot; the story idea is quite original, but the themes are what make the book so important. A ten year old reader commented that the book is confusing, and although I do not agree, I would say that the short book packs a powerful punch!  This would be a wonderful book for family discussion, class assigned reading, or even a bible study.  Recommended to audiences of all ages and of my favorites!
1559408758|4.0|THIS IS SPINAL TAP is a &quot;rock-u-mentary&quot; that follows the popular British heavy metal band Spinal Tap as they do there first rock tour in the United States to promote there new album called &quot;Smell The Glove.&quot; The Special Edition DVD of this film includes theatrical trailers, TV commercials with Spinal Tap, deleted scenes, and much more. The film also contains some classic Spinal Tap songs such as &quot;We're Gonna Rock You (Tonight),&quot; &quot;Big Bottoms,&quot; &quot;Sex Farm Woman,&quot; and much more.
0440180295|4.0|This is clearly Vonnegut's most famous work and that's probably the reason it was the first that I've read (I've read 11 now). In my point of view this is the perfect book to get started on: it introduces Vonnegut's writing style and it peaks one's interest for more. However, this is by no means his best. Probably the most interesting part of the book is not the humor, which is usually the most interesting, but instead the factual basis of the novel: the bombing of Dresden. <br />What also interested me in this book was Vonnegut's way of telling stories outside of time. Although he does this in many of his novels, I think this is the book where it is more sophisticated and is vitally important to the plot as a whole. <br />I definantly recommend this book to anyone interested in getting to know Vonnegut's work.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Someone has to tell me, is it a crime that this collection was made? Sade sends me onto some other celestial plain from which I have no desire to leave.<br />Most every song from this album can be safely placed on the soundtrack of my life (It's a Box Set). Is it a Crime, Kiss of Life , Smooth Operator,No Ordinary love and Your Love is King are my absolute favourites in that order.<br />Sade is a once in a lifetime artist and performer.  No true Music Lover should be without a CD by Sade in their collection.  Make this CD the one you have.
B000002H2Z|3.0|&quot;Inconsistent&quot; is the right word for Head on the Door. That makes sense - Robert Smith and his homies had just tired of their horribly scary goth posturing (Faith, Pornography) and were searching for a new style. Head on the Door is a very strange venture into dance-pop. <br />It's certainly something, and there's no other Cure album quite like it. The first track takes on New Order at their own game (and beats them), another (&quot;The Blood&quot;) has a distinctly Spanish sound (the song is about a Spanish wine), and so forth. Every song is different. In some cases, we already begin to see the development of The Cure's future trappings - &quot;Push&quot; and some others have the same otherworldly guitars that would later become the band's signature style, &quot;Close to Me&quot; has a synth lead very much like the later &quot;Lovesong,&quot; and so on. While the music is almost always great, however, Smith's voice occasionally is not up to par - it may be just under-rehearsal (most of the tracks here went on the album after the first take).<br />Anyways, the best moments are decidedly &quot;Push,&quot; &quot;A Night Like This&quot; and &quot;Sinking.&quot; The worst are &quot;Close To Me&quot; and &quot;Screw,&quot; the latter probably being the most embarrassing Cure song ever. The rest are good while they're playing, but ultimately forgettable. When the album hits its high points, though, make no mistake - it shines very brightly. It closes with &quot;Sinking,&quot; making a wonderful parting impression that serves to erase the bewilderment (as in &quot;um...why is this on here?&quot;) brought on by, say, &quot;Screw.&quot; I recommend it for Cure fans who are interested in tracking the band's musical development (or for Cure fans, period) - it's really not a very accurate introduction to the Cure for those who know nothing about them. Get Wish, and if you like it, by all means get this CD. If not, well, you probably shouldn't.
0060934913|5.0|This is a very entertaining and humorious account of Anthony Boudain's life.  Infact, many a times it had me laughing out loud.  It really gives you an idea of what the inside of a kitchen is all about.  It was recommended to me and I am glad about that.  I was unable to put it down.  I have already recommended this book to several people....and I just finished it an hour ago.
0060930187|4.0|This seems to me to be one of those books that you absolutely have to read even if you know you'll hate it - just because it's so important, so touted and so, well, very well-written. Like the summaries say, it &quot;chronicles a gifted young woman's descent into insanity.&quot; It's very realistic because it was drawn directly from real life - the protagonist (one Esther Greenwood) _is_ Sylvia Plath, more or less. Plath very vividly describes every detail of every day, and fleshes out her character completely.<br />My one impression was bewilderment at the emptiness, soullessness and lack of purpose of most of the characters in the book, Esther included. However, this was not due to the author but due to the author's subjects - people _are_ really like that, and you'll realize that at some point in the book and you'll hope to hell that you're different. (So just for that little revelation, I recommend it.) Every one of the characters is so real that you probably know someone exactly like them - the crusty Jay Cee, the means-well-but-is-a-complete-jerk Buddy Willard, all the various young women who think nothing of giving away their bodies to a fleeting acquaintance, Esther, who is incapable of achieving anything despite her obvious talent and so plans to affirm her identity through sleeping with someone she just met, etc. None of them are exaggerated in the least. <br />At the end, the story will leave the readers asking why all this happened, why Esther went crazy, why she couldn't do something with her talents, why no one seems to have any reason to take up space on the earth, whose fault is it, what do we do about it, why it has to be like this, and so on. The book provides no answers to any of that, and unfortunately, it's too late to ask Sylvia Plath to answer.
0694003611|5.0|I have read this book to my daughter since she was only a couple weeks old (she's now 17 mos). It is a very easy to read book that we really enjoy to sit together and look at. Leads perfectly into time for bed. It just has a really nice flow to the words.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Bitney did it again, this album is very good, all that songs (specially Satisfaction, What u see is what u get, can`t make you love me, and Stronger.) are great, this album is better than ...Baby one more time, Britney show than is much better than the others.... Isnt only a beatiful woman, also she has a lot of talent, right now its the most artist female, NOTHING COMPARES HER.
0553106635|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is, hands down, the BEST current fantasy series.  The plot is intricate, gripping, and full of surprises.  This isn't fine literature, but it is a first class story.  One never gets the sense that the plot is out of control, and Martin is a competent auther who writes natural feeling dialog.  I can't wait for the next book!!
B0000027RL|5.0|Nevermind is an excellent album but really is just punk. Not that there's anything wrong with punk but it bears no comparison to the emotional rollercoaster of this album.  This album proves that music doesn't have to be &quot;heavy&quot; to be powerful. Every song has an unstoppable groove which results in this being the only album ever that makes me feel part of it when I am listening to it.<br />I find it incredible that a band can be together for a few months and produce this kind of work. Unfortunately this shows in the drop in quality of all their subsequent albums, all of which feature some excellent songs (Daughter, Immortality, Off He Goes to name but a few), but none of which have the force of Ten.  But if a band could choose one album to make, this would be it.  The only album I have ever heard that gets anywhere near Ten is Led Zeppelin IV.<br />From the time that the drumbeat kicks in over the first frantic chords of Once, to the final fade of Release you can't bring yourself to press Stop.  In fact I think that the Master/Slave hidden track is there to remind you to change the CD as you collapse breathless from the ride.<br />The album also contains some excellent pieces of playing - Mike's lead play throughout is soaring and majestic, and fits with the rest of the music so well. The drum line in Porch that you hear just before the vocals come in after the instrumental break is truly mesmerising. Jeff's bass keeps the whole lot riding on a very solid base (no pun intended). Eddie's vocals don't need dicussion, and the songwriting is exemplary, with Stone marshalling the talents of 5 musicians to perfection.<br />And then there's the lyrics. I never understood many of Kurt Cobain's lyrics, although songs like SLTS and Lithium have a clear message with excellent lyrics.  But Eddie's lyrics are in plain English and tell stories and describe emotions without resorting to being too blatant.<br />I challenge anyone not to find this album completely riveting,as long as they give it a chance. I bought it almost 1 year ago now and have only seen the need to buy 3 other CDs since then, and they've hardly had a chance in the CD player.<br />To sum up, there's not one bad song on the album and it's a completely involving experience.
0782008372|5.0|Christopher Lambert plays Connor MacLeod, a man who seems to be your normal, everyday guy, and he is, except he's over 400 years old and can only die when decapitated.  That is basically the whole premise of the original Highlander and it's sequels, and amazingly, the story seems to stay fresh throughout this first installment of the classic series.  Sean Connery is fantastic as Ramirez and in my view Highlander would not be as good as it is without his presence.  Clancy Brown is also good as the villian Kurgan who stalks Connor throughout the years in the movie, leading up to the final battle between the two culminating in the claiming of the prize the Immortals fight for.  This is the best Highlander movie, but my only gripe is that the DVD picture quality is nowhere to be seen and if you watch this next to the video version of Highlander you'll see no difference.  Despite that minor gripe, this is a classic plus its on DVD, and no Highlander fan should be without it....
6305268843|5.0|I like most period dramas and this movie has had an emotional effect on me unlike any other that I have seen. It is not a tear jerker, it just has a certain mood established by its setting that evokes a strong response. The impact if the love story is secondary to  the interplay between the mother and daughter especially when the daughter discovers her true identity. It is a rare event indeed in this industry that all elements of a production (music, actors, plot, cinematography) all come together so perfectly. It did here.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|To those of you that have complained about awful DTS or DD sound with this DVD, I have found the answer.<br />I rented the DTS DVD from a rental club and it was AWESOME!  I couldn't help but think that folks here that were describing audio problems with this DVD had defective systems somehow.<br />I just BOUGHT the DVD and the sound quality is horrendous -- exactly as it was described by others here (no center channel audio, etc).<br />Evidently there are some copies of this DVD in circulation that were manufactured improperly.  If you get one that was done right, the DVD is INCREDIBLE!  The bad ones are truly awful.
B000002L5I|4.0|Too bad there's no such thing as Top-40 radio to expose Shepherd's talent.  &quot;I Found Love&quot; is worth the price alone.  &quot;Blue On Black&quot; will still sound good in 20 years.  Excellent Blues/Rock CD.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'm a light skinned sista who's always tryin' to get a tan.  But never before have I been so jealous of those with &quot;Brown Skin.&quot;  India Arie's song of that name is senuous, sexy, and just downright beautiful.  And, yet, it's also a song about self-love -- about the love of someone who shares her skin color.  Ordinarily, you'd hear something more transparent when talking that subject, like &quot;I'm Black and I'm Beautiful.&quot;  That's a meaningful slogan, but India Arie's song gives the same message subtly, brilliantly.  That's not her only marvel.  Video, Beautiful and Wonderful (the tribute the Stevie Wonder) are also brilliantly written and performed.  They are my favorites, but every song on the CD is lovely.  Thank you, India, for joining Eryka Badu, Jill Scott and Lauren Hill to show us all that creativity and beauty still exist for a 35 year Black woman who's not into hip hop.
0060392886|5.0|I bought and read this book hoping to laugh at some wild rock-n-roll war stories.  What I got was a book documenting four really sad stories.  These guys have been to hell and back and are currently paying the piper.  It was more of a downer than I had hoped it would be.  But still, a must read for die hard Motley Crue fans - but the story is a bummer - A book like this makes one feel happy for what they have in their life, and for what they do not have to put up with.
B000002MUN|5.0|Okay, yeah, there are great artists with great songs out there. This though, is a great artist with a great album. Like U2's &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; or, even more appropriate, &quot;Actung Baby&quot;, &quot;Wildflowers&quot; is pure greatness from the first note to the last.  I bought this album knowing Tom Petty was doing some different things. Nothing too different, but different. This album is a mature and insightful Tom Petty that has been longing. His early work is remakable, this is stupendous.  Each and every song has it's own feeling, but not one too far from the other. It's almost like every song deserves it's own spin-off album.  This is the start of the Tom Petty that is still incredible today and has not stopped. Start here and keep going. &quot;Echo&quot; is a great place to end. But then there will be more greatness. Seriously, get in the car, drive on a great stretch of road and let yourself get lost in &quot;Wildflowers&quot;. It's perfect.
6305546789|5.0|This is a scary movie, even after 23 years since its release.  I had actually never seen this movie until I was in the video store, walking along the aisles.  And there it was, Halloween.  I had known it was a &quot;slasher flick&quot; and had about 10 sequels, but, I figured, it was Halloween time and I should rent it.<br />This is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen.  The ending was even more disturbing when you see what Michael Myers is seeing.  And you hear him breathing!  And when Jamie Lee Curtis thinks she killed Michael Myers and he gets up, man, I was yelling at the T.V.  This is a very very scary movie.  You actually feel it more than you watch it.<br />If you want a good scare buy this movie.  I bought the DVD and am very pleased with it.
B00000APLB|5.0|This is the Stones in their heyday...straight out balls -to-the-wall-ROCK. A quality recording with unique modern at the time- tunes..mixed in w/the classics..This album ROCKS! I wore out this(vinyl)album from many a partying summer afternoon in my teens...along with their other great album- HOT ROCKS-1964-1971. Enjoy! Turn IT UP! Get this one from the greatest true ROCK band.
B00005B6C9|5.0|The Bee Gees have certainly proved they are still HOT with this album. This is really a combination of songs that shows Barry, Robin and Maurice's separate styles, with each of them singing \\"their\\" songs. Also, when they come together, there is no way to describe it! <br />So there you have it! Believe me.....if you are a Gibb fan...you will not be disappointed with this album. My Mom and Dad are both Bee Gees fans, so thanks to them, I might now be an even bigger fan then they are! I am fourteen and will love and respect The Bee Gees (Oh, and my Mom and Dad!) forever!
B00003CXDZ|1.0|What a dreadful bore! The director should have been fired or given serious psychiatric help. Moulin Rouge reminded me of a high school production with a huge budget. Memorable music? Oh, give me a break! It was an embarassment except for a few fleeting moments of inspiration.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Once again Travis prove that they are one of the best bands around. And perhaps most interestingly of all, they don't achieve this accolade by indulging in over complicated song structures, drum loops, hip-hop influences, or any of the other things so prevalent in today's rock scene. No, Travis is a basics band, a guitar based group who focus on the important things - good melodies and expressiveness. It's pretty difficult to find another band that sound so full of emotion... mainly due to the haunting singing of Fran Healy. Fran sings with such emotion and expressiveness, that having heard one of his songs, everything else you hear after it will seem strangely emotionless, feelingless. The Invisible Band is slightly behind their previous effort, The Man Who, in my personal taste. Neverthless it is an excellent album, which shows what music should be... the expression of emotion through sound. Get this album, you will not be disappointed.
B00003CXP1|5.0|If you haven't the slightest what to think,  you are feeling the same thing that happens after you watch this movie.  I still get all tweeked when I hear the music fro the movie ( which they play on the site).  There will never be anythin to top this film.  Both content and eye candy have my full approval.  PS-I am very picky about films I see.
B00003CXAA|1.0|I love the movie (5 stars) but this HIGH PRICED DVD is crass commercialism at its height. The producers simply wanted to cash in on the marketability of the Godfather mystique. If they are true film lovers they should release the movie WITHOUT the old and recycled documentaries at a more reasonable price and release a special edition for those who want to waste their time on second-rate documentaries.<br />DVD lovers watch out... if this turns into a hot seller, expect to see more of the modern classics packaged in the same gouging way.
B00004Z459|5.0|Best songs are Points of Authority &amp; With You. One of the better new bands of late 2000. Hope to see more from them.
B000021Y77|5.0|I just had the pleasure of renting and watching this movie on DVD. What makes this film great is basically the hip, stylistic camera work. It had the style of a short film but was carried wonderfully into a simple yet engrossing feature length film. Throughout the film the director plays little head games with the viewer by starting the story over but it never gets confusing or boring. Some may say that this is a film directed to the dumbed down &quot;MTV Generation&quot; but what i saw was just a hip, entertaining movie. The english dub on the DVD is my only minor complaint. The english language track seemed to be a little less offensive making the film lose a little of its intended edge. This is a very well done german film with a great soundtrack that shouldn't be missed.
B00003CY5K|5.0|I just saw the sneak preview of Legally Blond and I haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time.  It borders on being teenagerish but has a broad appeal.  I especially appreciated both the ethics of the main character -and- the growth that occurs in her as the movie progresses.  I recommend Legally Blond to everyone!!!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|If you love musicals, you'll definately want to see this one! I enjoyed Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's performances and they're vocal talents were surprising, because they've been so well known for only their acting ability for a long time. Actually, I was tempted to write this review in response to another review I had read. It was completely antagonistic to this movie as a whole. And this person indicated they have had 50 or so years of experience in rating movies. I feel the need to defend this movie. This person's problem may have come from a lack of preference to musicals, or maybe because the movie dealt with some moral issues that in other people's opinions aren't appropriate.It's all a matter of opinion, people!!! I'm not insinuating that EVERYONE is going to love this movie, because there are people whose tastes are different, which isn't a bad thing. All I'm saying is if you love musicals, and you enjoy Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's acting and singing skills, than you'll enjoy this movie. If you don't, than in my opinion, it's your loss!!!
0792151712|5.0|I give it 5 only because there is no 4.5, and thus I can hope to offset the people who rate it as 1 star simply because it wasn't their cup of tea.  Titanic is a phenomenal movie, and it happenned to have been phenomenally successful.  Winslet shines on screen, and DiCapprio is fine, with his... dialogue.

0380973650|3.0|&quot;American Gods&quot; is not so much a novel as it is a chronicle of the main character's bladder with bits of story in between. But the story is pretty good.<br />Readers of Gaiman's &quot;The Sandman&quot; will recognize the world presented in &quot;American God's&quot; very well; in fact, &quot;American God's&quot; might better be titled &quot;Sandman: Book 12.&quot; The rules of Gaiman's mythos are essentially the same: every god or legend that has ever been believed in currently exists somewhere in the world, and these beings have magic powers and abilities in direct proportion to the number of people who believe in them. This is an exciting concept, for Gaiman is perhaps the first to recognize that in a world thats cultures are coming closer together and interacting more (due to the advances in telecommunications), it is natural that the mythologies of those cultures should also come to blend. In &quot;Sandman,&quot; and continuing in &quot;American Gods,&quot; Gaiman has created a kind of Panagean super-mythos in which the beings from all mythologies can come together and interact.<br />Just about every story that explores an unusual world needs a &quot;Joe Average&quot; to ground the story and to have the rules of the strange world explained to him (and thus, the reader.) This is usually, but need not be, the main character. Alice, of &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; Dorothy of &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; Arthur Dent of &quot;The Hithhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and Cliff Steel of &quot;The Doom Patrol&quot; all serve this purpose. &quot;American Gods'&quot; straight man is Shadow, the guy with the bladder. Perhaps in order to avoid the easy trap of having his straight man be flat and boring, (which was the one serious flaw of his otherwise excellent previous novel, &quot;Neverwhere&quot;) Gaiman made Shadow an ex-con. This is a good idea, and might have served as a means of spicing him up if only we had some idea as to why he had performed the crime in question. But we don't. Nor does Shadow really act in any way that suggests that he is a felon; he just seems to be a relatively nice guy who happens to have committed armed robbery and assault in the way that one may be a nice guy and happen to be--say--an ornithologist. But while being both a nice guy and an ornithologist is not mutually exclusive, one does not expect a felon to be a nice guy unless there is some unusual factor involoved. But we really do not get many hints as to who Shadow is and what makes him tick. He is little more than a sheep, following, and sometimes participating in, (although we don't really know why) the events of the story as they unfold. And while he managed to get away with this in &quot;Neverwhere&quot; because the supporting cast and antagonists were so phenomenal, the personalities of the supporting cast of &quot;American Gods&quot; are more often flat than not. The most confusing part is that Gaiman CAN write a good straight man; Matthew the Raven of &quot;The Sandman&quot; was one of the best of these types of characters that I've ever encountered.<br />With that said, I really did enjoy the novel anyway. The premise is good, the story is good, the observations and inserts in the prose that are sometimes quite brilliant, and there are some very nice plot twists toward the end.<br />A fun novel, but not a great one.crime in question.

B000005IU2|5.0|I love music and I have collected over a thousand lps, cds, and audio tapes. Over half of these are jazz albums. I buy rock music recordings sparingly because I find that over time my interest dissolves after repeated listening to most of it. But this album is special! I wore out this LP when I bought it and thirty years later I still listen to the CD. This is a recording of amazing visceral power. It's as sparse and melodic as Thelonius Monk, deep and emotional as John Coltrane and as irreverant and funky as Miles himself. I am still not tired of the music on this recording. Coming from me this is quite a compliment.
B000001FNL|4.0|&quot;Main Course&quot;, is to me the best Bee Gees album- a must have !The brothers Gibb explore different genres of music, including country and Rhythm and Blues. Tracks include -&quot;Jive Talkin&quot;, &quot;Nights on Broadway&quot;, &quot;Fanny (be tender with my love)&quot;. Pre -Saturday Night Fever-- a must for all serious bee gees fans !
B00000JGHS|5.0|Demi Moore is at her hottest in this film. It is funny too. Be sure to buy this.
B000059XUO|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made and it is so great   that Dimension has finally decided to release a special  edition of the crow if anyone who owns the first dvd of the crow   thinks they do not need this version they our mistaken this version includes deleted scenes and extended scenes the deleted scenes that will impress this who know about the comic book will love the scene with the skull cowboy and if that is not enough for you their is Brandon Lee last interview On this dvd so it was great that they finally released this specail edition becuse I never bought the other version becuse it never had Brandon last Inteview before his death but even I never thought the special edition would have so many extras oh and it is a bargain at amazon .com becuse I have seen it for about... in  some retail stores, thanks Amazon for making it available for such a great price.
B00005AXEL|3.0|But it is the most complete album she's made since then. There are no hits on this album, except for a country rock song called Too Far From Texas, which hasn't been released yet. I think a video with her and Natalia singing this song will propel this song up the country charts and possibly the pop charts. The other songs I like are the ones which she wrote in the seventies--Candlebright, Planets of the Universe, Sorcerer. I Miss You, It's Only Love, Fall From Grace and Bombay Sapphire are &quot;kinda good, but not quite.&quot;The problem with this album is definitely the writing. A lot of the songs seem like outtakes. The producers give each song a slick production and the best thing about the album is the production. Stevie's writing, however, sounds as if she hasn't grown at all. The title track is just a bunch of &quot;train of thought&quot; lyrics and it's embarrassing. &quot;That made me stronger&quot; sounds great but the song will never get played on radio because the lyrics are way too self-absorbed. In fact, Stevie is still way too self absorbed. And she doesn't have the edge to her melodies that she had in the seventies, and rarely hits any high notes. She talks her way through a lot of these songs (BIG SURPRISE).There is just not many suprises on this album. It's disapointing.  She worked for seven years on this album and THIS IS ALL WE GET. I wanted hit songs. She had the momentum to get played on the radiio if she gave them some really good songs.It's really hard being a Stevie Nicks fan: People make fun of you for being a fan of hers, especially if your male, and then you get nothing in return but another self-absorbed album that you have to make yourself like. Yet, Stevie still claims to be a great writer. She hasn't faced reality yet--she WAS a great writer. Although I will always be a fan of hers, I wish that most of the songs on her next album will be written by someone else. This album is not much of a comeback. Sorry, fellow Nicks' fans but that's the way I feel. (3 for a great production and 4 really good songs, but that's all.)
0440178002|5.0|I first heard about Shogun from a friend of mine when I was at UofI. My friend suggested the book because I was really into Japanese culture. It was an excellent book and I was very happy that I read it, although my grades did suffer a little.  After reading the review of Stuart W. Mirsky, I realized I had to make a comment on his mistake. He claims that James Clavell had a few characters in his book using Judo and kicking, when they were not around in Japan in the 1600's. This is in fact not correct. In the book, the characters do not use Judo, they in fact use Jujitsu. It is evident when one character pushes on a pressure point against the main character, that it is not Judo but Jujitsu. Jujitsu is Judo, but with the use of pressure points included. Also, in order to recieve a black belt in Jujitsu, one must be adept at kicking. I highly suggest to Stuart W. Mirsky that he researches material before he goes talks about them.
B000005DQR|5.0|Catchy and clever. I let this one sit for 3 yrs before a recordstore clerk recommended it.  Then I instantly liked it.  I guess you have to be ready for it.
B00005A3KS|1.0|Just like Arie Socorro, I had the same problem on the picture freezing on that particular chapter. You have to skip to the next chapter to get it going. Other than that this movie is great
B00004SVIK|5.0|Amazing Abosolutely Amazing. When I Bought the Wall I thought Pink Floyd was the best thing since fire! I knew I had to own all of they're CD's! I had no Idea that a live performance could be better than the Original. Hey You! was performed so amazingly that I cant stop listening to it! The clean guitar through the performance! What Shall We Do Now! Is an amazing song that just gives you that feeling that your In the Front Row! Masters of Ceremony Which opens the first CD acts as an introduction then all of the sudden In the flesh's first note explodes clear and LOUD! What I expected when I bought it was a much less sounding performance with applause throughout all of the songs. I just bought it for the collective purposes. But it was Amazing Absolutely Amazing!
0064407667|1.0|The author oh so cleverly warns you this a dark, dreary book where bad things happen.  Believe that.  It's not cute and it's not clever.  It's a depressing book.  The whole selling point of this book is that it's short and fun.  It's short, yet too long, because it is not fun.  One reviewer says the series improves.  I'll never know because I definitely will not waste my time trying to find out.
0618001905|4.0|King Leopold's Ghost is such a horrific and gripping account of the terror that took place in the Belgium Congo during the King's 23 year reign in the early 1900's. This book took me by complete surprise as I was looking for an historical account of this time period for a research project. I had never studied or even read about the horror that took place a century ago in the Congo and was amazed at the exploitation and murder of the population that went on so freely and completely unchecked. Anyone interested in the history of the Congo or in Africa would find this book both intelligently and frankly written. The detailed accounts of terror and murder are shocking but they will keep you reading until the end. I am currently searching for more &quot;true&quot; material of this time to read! This book has inspired me to learn more.
0060194995|5.0|BRILLIANT!  That's what I thought when I finished this book.  The depiction of small town bigotry, coupled with the &quot;myth&quot; of Arthur (Boo) Radley made for a spectacular and eye-opening read.  It couples several themes, as well.  Love and Hate, Innocense and Experience, Right and Wrong.  All come together for a spectacular finale which the movie fails completely to display at it's utmost meaning.  Don't just sell out and watch the movie.  If you have not read this masterpiece yet, I strongly suggest that you do.  You won't be sorry.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|My sister told me to go see this moive everyweek and i would tell her no no no im too busy busy busy. But then one day i finally went out and saw it. Throughout the whole entire moive i could not stop smiling this was the greatest moive i had ever seen. The music was great and the acting was wonderful. It make me laugh and cry. Belive it or not i have seen Moulin Rouge at the theatres 5 times! Thats how crazy i am about this moive. I take all my friends. The soundtrack is so wonderful. When Ewan Mcgregor sings your song i just about died at how awesome the singing was and how cute he was! he couldnt get any better with his innocence and jealousy. Nicole Kidman was amazing with her singing and acting. I cannot WAIT for this moive to come out on video. It ws truly &quot; Spectacular Spectacular&quot;!!
0195117298|2.0|The newspaper reviews led me to buy this book.  It is far beyond my novice capability to comprehend.  I think four years of college is not quite enough education to grasp this theory.  Not a &quot;Physics for Dummies&quot; type of book.
B000002GEY|5.0|You'll start this disc and it will be all over in a fun rush. You'll immediately start it again and it will breeze by.  Thank G-d CDs don't wear out. This is a GREAT disc! (Excuse me, I need to go hit PLAY again.)
B00005B4GU|5.0|I'll do a few things in this review. I'll give some facts about the album, go over the songs, and comment on the packaging (which is important on Radiohead albums and very important when it comes to the limited edition of this one).<br />The historical background: When they released Kid A in Oct 2000, Radiohead said they had recorded more than 20 songs and they weren't kidding. It is very tempting to consider these 2 different albums and critics have already labelled Amnesiac as a sort of reaction to Kid A and a return to more conventional Radiohead. The truth is that Radiohead had all those songs recorded, took 10 tracks to make Kid A, and have chosen 11 more for Amnesiac. I happen to be a big fan of those sessions and argue that they produced Radiohead's best work to date. Don't expect Kid B or a regression from Kid A and it doesn't matter if you haven't heard Kid A.<br />The songs:<br />- 1. Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box It's got a drum machine and electronic effects, follows in the tradition of Radiohead openers, and is an excellent song. Note that when played live, it's a rocker.<br />- 2. Pyramid Song A good representative of this period in the band's career. You've probably heard this one since it's the first release.<br />- 3. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors It's totally electronic with computerized vocals and very strange. It's a love or hate song.<br />- 4. You and Whose Army This one is Thom on crooning one of his best vocal performances while playing piano. It's just him and the bass until the rest of the band come in at the climactic and anthemic ending.<br />- 5. I Might Be Wrong This one is a riff based rocker. It's one of the more radio friendly tunes on the album and might be released as a single.<br />- 6. Knives Out This is another riff based song and note that it features all of the members playing their &quot;original&quot; instruments. It has drums, bass, and 3 guitars along with a great vocal. This one will be released as a single next inAugust.<br />- 7. Morning Bell/Amnesiac This is a reprise of Morning Bell from Kid A. Thom's vocals are haunting and drive the track. It's a great song in both versions but the original is played live.<br />- 8. Dollars and Cents A very spooky song that is based on a bass riff and enhanced by a wonderful orchestra. One of the more moody pieces where Thom shines.<br />- 9. Hunting Bears An instrumental that has only guitar with some background noise. The guitar is reminiscent of the vocal in I Might Be Wrong but not enough so to be considered a reprise. Note that it's pretty short (one of the better aspects).<br />- 10. Like Spinning Plates Completely electronic with distorted vocals. However, it's not as hit or miss as Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors. It is an excellent instrumental and the vocals add to this to make it one of the most intense and haunting songs. It's said to be a reversed version of another unreleased instrumental track and in my opinion, the best instrumental track they've done. It is more conventional in it's original unreleased form but it's great whether backwards or fowards.<br />- 11. Life in a Glass House Follows in Radiohead's tradition of emotional closers and features a jazz band. The song is very emotional and builds to a climactic end.<br />The sleeve: The artwork is very strange and is pretty much hit or miss. It features computer manipulation of photographs, paintings, and drawings. The booklet has no lyrics. A very important note is that the artwork in the album and in the limited edition book is the same (with a few subtle differences in cropping and two more images in the book). The difference is that the book a library card from &quot;Nosuch Library&quot; with dates in the future where it holds the cd. For this reason I advise against purchasing both. I thought the book was cool, but had I known the cd's artwork was practically identical I might not have bought both.<br />The band: I'll close by saying I give 5 stars because I am a fanof the band. They consistently make great music and I gave all of their albums 5 stars (after Pablo Honey which I gave 3). The thing I love about them is that they continue to move foward with their music and manage to keep their identity and artistic integrity. They knew they couldn't follow up Ok Computer with Ok Computer Part II. Instead of feeling pressure to follow up their masterpiece record they moved on to produce some of the most groundbreaking music in recent times (Kid A and Amnesiac). Note that Ok Computer was the same: It was not a follow-up to their previous masterpiece, The Bends. They have made a career of putting out records that are impossible to follow up, then changing and keeping the incredible quality of their music. Radiohead definitely deserve a lot of respect for making music on their own terms.
0140186409|1.0|I was forced to read this novel for freshman English, and although in general I think it had an important message and theme, but, man, was it ever boring!  I really liked certain passages and the theme, but much of it was told in such an obtuse way and focused on such minute details that I could hardly stand it.  I've read books on genetics, i.e. no plot, no characters, that held my attention far better and used words more economically than The Grapes of Wrath.  Perhaps if the novel had ended 400 pages or so before it actually did, I could have stomached it better.
B00004XONN|5.0|It was impossible to follow up the Bends, so they didn't try to and put out an even better record: Ok Computer. Similarly, it was perhaps even more impossible to follow up Ok Computer, so they didn't try and put out Kid A (whose better-ness is deliciously debateable).<br />Kid A is a love or hate record. I love it and you have to look carefully at these reviews, listen to clips, and watch blips, to see whether you will.<br />The hate clearly comes from those who are freaked out by electronic music. Synths will get in the way of your enjoyment of this album if you are are one of these people. However, I was one of these people(!) and this album showed me that electronic music can be amazing. I have since become a lover of electronic music.<br />The love for Kid A comes from those who realize that this is indeed still Radiohead(!) and that the quality of the music is just as good, if not even better than any of their previous work. Fooling around with odd time signatures is present: Morning Bell is in 5/4, EIIRP I still haven't figured out! And (of course) Thom is once again a virtuoso singer, crooning and snarling pure emotion throughout the album.<br />The use of computers to make music was (obviously) started in an almost primitive way on Ok Computer. Simple electronics supplemented wonderful tracks like Exit Music (for a film). On Kid A, much more evolved electronics add even more to the already amazing music. A perfect example is Motion Picture Soundtrack: a wonderful song as an acoustic demo, but on the album, an incredibly poignant closer worthy of being called Radiohead's best studio work.<br />It may come as a surprise at this point in the review to say that there is not even that much computerized music on this album. Some tracks have none at all like: How to Disappear, Optimistic, and Morning Bell (it has keyboard). A few tracks merely have &quot;effects&quot; used like the ones in Ok Computer, namely: The National Anthem (beginning and end), and In Limbo (at the end). EIIRP and Motion Picture Soundtrack are in-betweeners as the samples are more advanced. The rest of the tracks, Kid A, Treefingers, and Idioteque, are heavily computer based.<br />Despite the contrasting styles, they cause no confict what so ever, and as a whole, Kid A shines. It's no wonder that they didn't release any singles. This is an absolute classic album with no clear &quot;single&quot; highlight. I have no doubt that it will age gracefully and come to be accepted as the masterpiece that it is.
078401213X|2.0|... This movie was terrible and I wanted to like it so much. It's the only movie I have ever seen [UPDATE: this review was written before the release of A Beautiful Mind] to show people playing GO. It has alot of fascinating ideas, it just doesn't know what to do with any of them. What is so astonishing is that these ideas which the movie barely scratches the surface of, the depth of GO, the Fibonnaci series, are so rich as to be wide open to he possiblity of a really great story. It's just too bad the writer could see none of it... or at least how to make a movie about them without resorting to a cheap cop-out ending. Too bad, the ending ruined an otherwise enjoyable movie...
B00003CXN4|2.0|I had read recently that members of the US Congress were making use of this movie to re-visit the policies of the War on Drugs.  If our congressmen see these hackneyed themes as major revelations, that is indeed frightening.<br />A few years back there was mini-series on Masterpiece Theater that, I assume, was based on the same novel, as the stories were almost identical.  A gentleman is appointed drug czar in the UK, just as he discovers that his daughter is an addict.  A major businessman is found to be a drug king-pin, to the shock and dismay of his wife, who then goes into the business herself, and is even better at it. Yada, yada....Of course, Masterpiece, with it's way of presenting a story over several weeks, rather than a mere 147 minutes, was able to go into much greater depth, and develop some real characters.  Besides which, the ideas presented were probably just a little newer (though not much) back in the eighties.<br />This movie version has far too much happening and far too many characters, so that the whole thing ends up rather flat. Indeed, had I not seen the mini-series I might not even have picked up on some of the many plots.  The wife's (Catherine Zeta-Jones) entering into the drug trade on her own, was just barely covered.  And a sub-plot about a business partner trying to move in on her when the husband was in prison, was so badly handled that you didn't even know it had happened until it was over.<br />It is the rare movie that can handle all the plots and characters that can be covered in a novel or mini-series.  Instead, they should try to pare down the characters and themes, and then cover them in greater depth.  As it was, the &quot;extra touches&quot; like filming all the Mexican scenes in a wavey, hot- yellow light did nothing to convince me that this was anymore artistic than your average drug heist movie.  And the supposedly &quot;new&quot; questions it raised, were actually very old ones.
158234082X|2.0|a good deal of my life was spent in kitchens very similar to those described by the author. i agree with his portrayals but feel the flow of this book is hampered by redundancy.
B00005B36H|3.0|I gave this album 3 stars for the redeeming moments (&quot;The Grudge&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot;). This album seems to be stuck back at where Tool's last album was, only they expanded on the boring non musical tracks. I laugh when Tool fans tell me they dont forward through Disposition because I know they do. If you're a big Tool fan you may like this. But if you want better songwriting and better lyrics i suggest the previous release Aenima.
B000050XEI|4.0|This is such a beautiful album, the only reason it didn't get five stars is the same downfall most Enya albums have: it is WAY too short. If you're going to crank out the cash, I think that you should get more than thirty some minutes of music. But, oh what a wonderful thirty some minutes it is!! <br />I must say, this is my favorite Enya album to date, the best tracks being the first three and &quot;Flora's Secret&quot;. One of my favorite things about Enya is the fact that she's somewhat predictable, but manages to keep things fresh. You'll NEVER be disappointed with ANY Enya album... EVER. &quot;Wild Child&quot; is one of my absoulte favorites, especially for a &quot;let's get the day started&quot; song. <br />With melodies you'll be humming all day and upbeat choruses that'll have you smiling within minutes, (although, there are a few more somber tunes) &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is one of the best music buys you could make, for yourself or a friend.
B000002N3N|5.0|I don't like to give things five stars, but I just couldn't help it with this album: it's that good.<br />This was my first Enya selection, my second favorite (after &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;) and I think it's the best one to start with. EVERY song on here is superb. There's not one song I don't skip: something hard to say about music now days. All the songs are beautiful, and this CD is in my player almost all the time. I'm sure you'll find it the same for you. &quot;Memory of Trees&quot; is absolutely wonderful, it's a song that &quot;gets you right here&quot; and makes you feel a way that can't be described. The rising and falling of the voices and music from a gentle, quiet melody to an emotional swell... it's something EVERYONE should experience. &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is another outstanding track, but, like I said, all are exceptional.<br />You can't go wrong with Enya; you really can't. This is a great album, though, and I really encourage new comers to Enya to try this one out first: I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B0000025ZK|5.0|David Gilmour's second of two solo albums is a work of genius, from the beginning making it very clear that this not just another Pink Floyd record (see The Wall, and Dark Side of the Moon).  The album starts out energetically with electric guitars and synthesizers in Until We Sleep, throws you around a bit, then backs off with the climatic acoustic ballad Near the End.  A must buy for any Pink Floyd or sci-fi music fan.
0790725657|3.0|This is just plainly, a very sad movie.  This is the only film I have ever seen that has made me cry.  I admit it.  It made me cry because it is so sad and heart breaking to watch.  I just kept sobbing my head off about what was happining to this little girl.  I just couldent stop crying.  I strongly recommend bringing in a tissue box because this is just so sad.<br />The good:  The ending is good, fantastic acting<br />The bad: Heartbreaking<br />And the Ugly: so * Sad, increadibly tear-jerking
0446310786|5.0|An extraordinary novel that shows us the South that existed several decades ago through the eyes of a child.  Scout Finch's world is full of wonder and mystery.  When her father, the lawyer Atticus Finch, takes the case of a black man who has been falsely accused of raping a white woman, she begins to see and understand both the ugliness that exists in the world and the meaning of true heroism.  Harper Lee's novel must be one of the most perceptive narratives from the viewpoint of a child ever written.
B00005B4GU|2.0|&quot;Amnesiac&quot; is a frustrating album.  About five seconds into the first song I felt like it was going to be a chore listening to it, and it was.  Radiohead's last album &quot;Kid A&quot; was frustrating at first too, but it grew on me.  While there are some songs on that album that just miss the mark there are also some brilliant songs.  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was written at the same time as &quot;Kid A&quot; and that is obvious.  There is no discernable difference between the two, and that is why it is a disappointment. &quot;OK Computer&quot; was big leap from &quot;The Bends&quot; and likewise was &quot;Kid A&quot; from &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; however, offers nothing new.<br />The opening song, &quot;Pakt like sardines in a crushed tin box,&quot; has keyboard humming much like &quot;Kid A's&quot; opening song &quot;Everything in its right place.&quot;  However, &quot;Pakt&quot; lacks the lyrical quality of &quot;Everything&quot; that made it so good.  Furthermore, &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,&quot; continues the rhythmless musical dysfunction that was &quot;Kid A's&quot; title track.  &quot;Pulk&quot; is supposed to be artistic I guess, but it really is unlistenable.<br />The most frustrating song of all is &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot;  This is the best song on the album.  It's full of melancholy singing and piano playing with lyrical instrumentation.  I'm afraid that it falls short of greatness though because of a choppy rhythm.  It's impossible to tap your foot to, and that makes it forgettable.<br />I've been a big fan of Radiohead for quite a while now and that's why I was really disappointed with &quot;Amnesiac.&quot;  The band is full of great musicians who are pushing modern music past radio-friendly pop.  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is artistic, but I doubt I'll be listening to it much.
B0000508U6|5.0|When I first listened to this album in its entirety, I was at my friend's lakeside cottage in upstate New York.  On the most beautiful day of the summer so far and with no one else around, we flung all the windows open and turned the stereo up way loud so we could still hear it when we were out in the canoe in the middle of the lake.  Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes&quot; plays much like the soundtrack to a beautiful life.  Melancholy at times, hopeful at others, Chris Martin's voice throughout is the sound of a beautifully wounded human being searching through the remains of what good in the world might be left for the taking.  <br />Songs that are this lyrical, a la Radiohead and Sarah McLachlan as two examples, sometimes tend to be remiss in offering a real rhythm that you feel you can move to.  Coldplay reconciles more successfully than most bands in its genre both mood and melody to create one of those albums that can be played from beginning to end without having to skip over any of the tracks.  Martin's voice has the same lingering quality of Dave Matthews' without some its strength, and in conjunction with haunting guitars and deliberately tense percussion, it streams throughout touching songs that fit almost any mood.  When life is good, this is the type of record that will make you smile spontaneously for no apparent good reason as you're driving home.  On those rainy days, &quot;Parachutes&quot; delivers the perfect brooding kind of setting to satisfy more needfully depressive tendencies.  Come bedtime, I cannot think of anything more delicate and soothing to put me to sleep.<br />If you've ever listened to Radiohead and wished they had a little more rhythm, or if you've listened to Travis and wished they had a little more soul, or if you've listened to &quot;Yellow&quot; and thought that THAT was the best song ever sung, then give all of &quot;Parachutes&quot; a listen.  Perhaps the most poignant message of the entire album comes in the opening track in which comes the prevalent confession that &quot;we live in a beautiful world.&quot;  Beyond this, the rest of the record stands to prove that despite the pains of unrequited love and rejection, we have everything to be grateful for in this silly little life.
B00005LC3Y|5.0|I LOVE this movie. As an ex-Marine, the first half in bootcamp still gives me the creeps. Stanley seemed to catch the feel of bootcamp perfectly. I can't believe they released the first DVD in mono. I'll be the first to get this one.
B00004Z3S2|4.0|This was a pretty good album but it wasn't like their other stuff. You get tired of the songs pretty quickly.
6305878323|5.0|Walt Disney's &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a glorious family film. Though I have only seen it on DVD (I wasn't born in 1964 when it opened at Radio City Music Hall), I was quite impressed by the special effects of the time including the &quot;Jolly Holiday&quot; sequence with dancing penquins, singing ducks and so on. Andrews is a class act. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert. And the songs are the kind of showtunes you'll sing again and again.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|Many of the &quot;funny&quot; scenes in this movie were not funny at all. It seems like the jokes you would make as a child in elementary school.
B00004XQP4|1.0|I'm tired of arguing whether or not Green Day is &quot;real&quot; punk rock.  Let's settle it right now: THEY NEVER WERE TO BEGIN WITH, AND THEY SURE AREN'T NOW!  Have any of you kids ever listened to their first vinyl EPs (well, I did...way back in 1989).  I'm assuming not, because if you did, you wouldn't be calling them &quot;punk&quot; anymore.  You probably wouldn't even be fans of them anymore, either.  I wouldn't blame you, though.  The recording quality was unbelievably poor, and the songs are stupid and sappy.  Did I mention they couldn't even play their instruments?  Well, I just did (and they still can't, even today).  That's right, kiddies, Billie Joe (a High School drop-out and stoner) still hasn't learned to play more than three chords in over the 10+ years he's been in the band.  Thank God John Kiffmyer left the band while he still could (back in early 1990) to pursue a college career.
0062502182|5.0|This book was a short read and was very good.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I've never been much of a Fleetwood Mac fan but once I took just one glance at the cover of Stevie Nick's Trouble In Shangri-La cd its appeal instantly allured me. I know that I shouldn't judge a book by its cover but, come on people, it helps when you're just browsing! So I placed the listening headphones over my ears and was suddely stilled into comotose. I must of listen to the first song at least three times through before leaving the store... Another standout was Planets Of The Universe. That tune and Every Day is probably the closest to Stevie's old sound. I fervently enjoy all of the spellbinding tracks that are conjured here (with the exception of Too Far From Texas) but my absolute favorites have got to be Trouble In Shangri-La, Planets Of The Universe, Bombay Sapphires, and Love Is, which has Sarah McLachlan backing vocals (beautifully might I add) and gracing us with her dexterous play at the piano and guitar... Stevie Nick's withholds a power unlike many to entrance and to drug you with her bewitching lyrics and one-of-a-kind voice. Trouble In Shangri-La should not be a buy to hesitate on. So let the magic of her newest solo work weave a spell on your soul ....<br />Highly, highly recommended!
B00000253N|5.0|&quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; is exactly what Dylan is about.  This is a story song where the listener is left to fill in the cracks.  Dylan has found a wonderful melody and hook and just tells us the story of someones life on top of it.  It is a marvelous song that would rate the album 3 stars evenif the rest of the CD were chain saw fights.  &quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot; is a beautiful number in which Dylan lets the song do the work.  What Dylan did here was to write 10 great songs and perform them simply.  If the material is this awesome why blow it with overblown production?  You're a big girl now, is a beautiful song reflecting sentiments all men have had at one time or another.  &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; is a tour de force that should be on any radio station's play list.  &quot;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts&quot; is nine minutes of folk perfection.  &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot;, &quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; and &quot;Buckets of Rain&quot; are three beautiful songs to finish out the album.  There's not a mistake on this record. Only the Beatles and the Stones have ever made records that rise to the level of this one.
0385484518|1.0|The subtitle is An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson. What is that lesson? Should we follow Morrie's example and go on Nightline, not once, not twice, but three times, to tell why dying isn't all that bad? &quot;How bad is it, Morrie,&quot; Ted Koppel asks on the last show. Morrie tries to lift his arm which promptly collapses back. It's like those old Roman gladiatorial games where the crowd watches someone die and enjoys the thrill. Not only is that fake, it's disgusting. Fake emotions abound in this book and if you email me I will send you a list too long to include here. I can assure you Morrie is fake and so is the author. Both are cleaned up and polished fictional characters, sanitized humanoids to make them look sweet and nice for a TV audience mentality. But all that is neither here nor there compared to the main fake message which is: &quot;Once you learn to die, you learn to live.&quot; Wow! That has a kind of catchy affected poetic asymmetry to it. Let's think. Is it true? Does it make sense. Or is it a pile of you know what? In this fake book one true thing came through. It's on page 116 where Morrie says, &quot;And you know what? The strangest thing. I began to enjoy my dependency. Now I enjoy when they turn me over on my side and rub cream on my behind. I revel in it. I close my eyes and soak it up.&quot; Yup, that's the truth. Morrie's truth. And a none-too-pleasant truth. But it's just part of an even more macabre truth: Morrie like dying. No! He loved it. He reveled in the process. And he delighted in the TV celebrity he got from it. Too bad he never got to see his literary success too. It turns out that dying has a terrible price attached to it: It puts you out of touch and is so, so permanent.
B000000W5F|5.0|Mick and Keith managed to have a little revival in the late seventies and early eighties.  Some Girls started the revival, and Tattoo You continued it (Never mind Emotional Rescue).  This album of course has the smash hits: &quot;Start Me Up&quot;, &quot;Little T &amp; A&quot;, &quot;Hang Fire&quot; but the other tracks here are awesome also.  &quot;Neighbors&quot; is just good rock and roll.  &quot;Tops&quot; is just Mick showing a little sense of humor and style.  A must purchase to hear the boys last hurrah before they turned into a lounge act.
B000020617|5.0|I have had this album for a long time, listened to it over and over, and I still think it's a great album. They're a great rock band, lots of fun. If you're a fan of RHCP, you'll probobly love the Foo Fighters, too.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I could go on and on explaining, convincing, trying to hammer it into your head that Radiohead is the best group ever.  Instead, I'll say that you should make up your own mind.  My only comment is that nowadays it's plainly necessary for artists to break ground, to at least try and buck the trend and be creative.<br />That probably means I won't see their videos on TRL, even if Fred Durst endorses them.<br />In all honesty I couldn't be happier.  This music has blown my mind every time I listened to it, from when I heard 'Paranoid Android' at the age of twelve to when I finally began to appreciate 'Let Down' and 'No Surprises' about two years later.  It's too easy to condescend, to say that Radiohead is a smart person's band, or that the reason they aren't popular amongst teens is due to the fact that MTV has stolen their souls.  I would rather glorify the fans than malign those who aren't.<br />This CD probably won't instigate a change in your IQ or personality.  I just hope that people give it a chance and maybe, hopefully, they'll be pleasantly surprised.
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unequivocal satire on postmodern American life, with messages of dissident revolt that are well suited to the decade in which they appear. Heller is almost systematic in the issues he touches: the frustration of the individual up against powerful and faceless bureaucracies; the anticommunist purges of the Cold War and its smug hypocrisies; and strong antiwar issues that dominate postmodern America. In Heller's works, escaping these traps and inconsistencies of government is essential in the pursuit of moral and self-preservation. After all, \\"The enemy,\\" as Yossarian puts it, \\"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\"
B000001FHV|4.0|Aside from a few songs that seem to be there as filler... this is the best of the later Mup's period. And, contrary to popular belief, there is more to this record than just &quot;Backwater&quot;. Nothing wrong with that song, either... but one listen to &quot;Things&quot; or &quot;Severed Goddess Hand&quot;, and the true charcter of this desperate longing album will come out and smack ya in the nose. Presuming that you want to be smacked in the nose, that is. And why wouldn't you? Because it hurts... that's why. But, the nice country groove of &quot;Comin Down&quot; will cradle you in it's arms and make it all better, I promise. Oh... and let's not forget the extra track... the kickin' reworking of &quot;Lake Of Fire&quot;... with listenable vocals!!!
B000002OVJ|4.0|I prefer the original  LP without the additional tracks.  Maybe I'm just closed-minded.
6301969294|5.0|Some of the people who critized this movie apparantly have never watched a 40's or 50's movie. In those days actors actually had to have some talent before they would be let on the stage.<br />While this movie is a bit dry, the message it brings is not, and it is the message which makes it interesting. The mentally challenged among us will not understand the plot or the message.<br />The Fountainhead will make you think. I recommend it.
B000053VAF|1.0|I hardly ever write reviews here, but when this awful movie appeared like a lurking demon to the left of my monitor I knew something had to be done. This movie was so bad that I walked out about 5 minutes before it ended at the theater. The only advantage to it on DVD is that it can be destroyed. If you like movies with terrible scripts, not-funny toilet humor, bad acting, poor direction, etc, then you MIGHT find this tolerable. How anybody could like this travesty is beyond me.
B00005BCNC|4.0|Well, let me start by saying I like Tom Hanks, but I'm not a really huge fan of his.  This movie, for me, was only average.  I could have written this storyline, and I'm no professional writer.  The time spent on the island was OK, but I kept on looking for more.  Once off the island, the movie really drags.  It could have been easily shortened up by at least 20 minutes with no loss whatsoever.  The film ends abruptly, as if they didn't know how to really finish it.  This movie badly needs more suspense, more action.  As it is, it will appeal only to the diehard Tom Hanks follower.
0345347951|4.0|Fantastic imagination, huge scope, and classic Clarke.  Some well known and excellent science fiction deals with the evolution of mankind, but Clarke's vision of the future is unusually vast.  When Clarke peers into the future of human evolution, he does not ask &quot;What is next,&quot; but rather, &quot;How will it end?&quot;  Though Clarke deals with this question in several of his works (including &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and 2001), Childhood's End is his most elegant and compelling answer to that question.  In a word, that answer is &quot;transcendence.&quot;<br />While dealing with the big questions, Clarke throws in some fascinating ideas, such as the concepts of racial memory and future memory, and some memorable characters.
B00003CXE6|2.0|Man, this is supposed to be a really good movie, so I had high hopes.  These hopes were shot down about ten minutes into it.   Not only is this film boring, but the sound effects drove me nuts.  The music is way too loud, the voices are so soft and muddled that I couldn't even understand what was being said half the time.  Lots of violence - if that is what supposed to make this film great, it doesn't do it for me.  (A headless horseman, big deal.)  Parts of it were very confusing and hard to follow.  I still don't understand the poisonous snake scene.  Maybe if I could have heard the dialogue over the background noise I'd have a better opinion of the movie.  Part of the problem, I think, is that it's a guy film.  Perhaps it's something a woman like me just can't appreciate.  What WAS that snake doing there?
0780625129|5.0|This movie starts of through the eyes of Danny Vinyard, a young boy who's life revolved around his older brother, Derek Vinyard, and racism.  Danny looked up to his older brother in ways that most young kids do to an older sibling, as if they are god.  It took me three years to finally sit down and watch this movie, not because I didn't want to, but because I never thought about it til tonight when me and my wife went to Blockbuster.  I just picked it up, and was saying that we should rent it because I have heard nothing but good reviews about it.  Well, the reviews didn't lie.<br />     This movie shows how life and prejudice are all a big problem in todays society.  How one race can't get along with the other because of somethings that happened in the past many years ago.  After the brutal slaughtering of two rival gang members of a different color for trying to steal a truck Derek's father had bought for him, Derek gets sent to prison for three years.  In the time he was in prison, Derek's younger brother Danny followed in his older brothers footsteps and got active in a white supremesis gang his brother had lead.  When Derek gets out of prison and goes to quit the gang, Danny becomes upset because he never had thought his brother would ever do that. After sitting down and listening to the horror story his older brother had in prison, Danny decides being racist is not the way to go.  And the only reason Danny was in the gang in the first place was to impress his older brother.  <br />     In my opinion, this was one of the greatest movies of all time, it shows us what is going on, and how the whole world will never get along because of race, religion, or just down out right different.  Life isn't fair to everyone, and just because you were born different, doesn't make you different. We're all equal.  Rent this movie, buy this movie, watch it over and over again.  It will be one that you will remember for the rest of your lives.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Can't really believe someone can be as ignorant as the guy who  thinks the Beatles are 'ripping off' groups like Oasis, who've actually grown up listening to the Beatles!<br />Anyway, if you're<br />(a)New to the Beatles - Buy this.What better introduction to a       group than 27 of their most popular songs ? Granted, they         arguably have better songs, but then that's because they          have too many great songs to fit in one album,that too one        compiled based on popularity over a very short span of            time. Most of this stuff is evergreen - moreover, the point        is this - if you    don't like this, you can safely ignore        the Beatles from here on !<br />(b)Someone who likes the Beatles, but doesn't LOVE them - Buy this.Chances are most of the stuff you liked is here, since it's likely to be among the more popular ones, perhaps played by your Beatles crazy friends!<br />(c)A Beatles fan - You've already bought this, right ? If not, do so now!Sure, you might have all the songs in here, but not together - what's more the sequence of songs is also great .. starting with the chart-busting,foot-tapping stuff from their ealry days like 'Love me do' to the more mature,experimental sounds of their later work (e.g 'The long & winding road'), reflecting their growth as a band.<br />(d)Someone who HATES the beatles - Wow, you mean you people actually exist  ? Great - so why are you wasting you're time on this review ? Go play your favourtie brand of noise !<br />Just in case you couldn't tell, i belong to (c) above. Have a nice day

And I believe these few examples support my view:<br />On page 49 the author contends that sin is not our true nature.  Read the book of Romans in the New Testament.  Pay particular attention to chapters 7 and 8 and you will see God telling us that there is an offering that has been made for our sinful flesh.

B00003CXRM|5.0|I saw the movie on a friends recomendation and was expecting to see an okay movie, but what I saw was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  In my opinion George Clooney and the Coen Bros. did a terrific job.  I also own the soundtrack (which I recomend) and I beleive the music in the movie just adds to it and makes it even better.

B000002UAU|4.0|&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was something of a transitional album for the Beatles as it gives a nod to psychedelia and mainstream pop. Listening to &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is akin to taking an acid trip while &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; is almost a variation of &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot; This amalgamation of the &quot;newer&quot; and &quot;older&quot; Beatle sounds make for an interesting listening experience. There's not a bad cut on this album and George Martin's production talents also shine here. The booklet that accompanies this CD makes for interesting reading too. Although &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a stronger, more straight ahead rock 'n' roll album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is a more colorful and interesting album. If nothing else, SP gave rise to art rock and it rightly deserves all the accolades it gets. Truly, SP is a classic rock album that sounds as fresh and innovative today as it did back in 1967. Even if you're not a Beatles fan, this is one album you'll want to have in your collection.
B000002GK1|5.0|...This cd rocks! Its the esence of grunge but its more than grunge. You can hear the bands rock and roll influences like led zepplin in this cd. Its pure rock. The singer give some of his best vocals on this one. When you listen you just want to get up and start banging your head against something. My favorite tracks one here is Rusty Cage and Slaves and Bulldozers. It also features Outshined, Jesus Christ Pose, and Face Pollution. But the whole cd is good.  Buy this! You wont be disapointed.
0788760440|1.0|Don't purchase the audiobook version read by Ruth Ann Phimister.<br />The main character is a girl, ergo, The *Girl* With a Pearl Earring.<br />The reader sounds like she's pushing 80.  Very irritating.  I kept having to tell myself that the story was being recounted by the girl when she was an old lady, but there's nothing in the actual book to suggest this.<br />How can a recorded book company go so wrong in chosing the voice of their reader?  It's simply maddening.
B0000029DD|5.0|Ever since I discovered this album a couple of days ago, I have not been able to stay off of it. It's just addicting. This guy had something in his music that's very hard to describe. Seems to me like one of those privileged souls who happen to have a gate leading out of them into their voices, to express feelings in the most unexpected ways.<br /> The first few chords of his voice and guitar on the opening &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; bring two names to my mind: Chris Isaak, but mainly, Robert Plant. The resemblance of the emotion he puts into his singing reminds me a LOT of the softer Led Zeppelin songs. Beside these elements, the album is carefully rounded with some very nice covers (Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and Benjamin Britten's &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot;) which I'd highly recommend listening to with lights down, during a rainy afternoon.<br /> It's a disgrace that we lost him... he died in an accident in Memphis on May 29, 1997. Why does this have to happen to some of the most brilliant people? Reminds me of Stevie Ray Vaughan.
052594527X|1.0|I wonder if the popularity of this book is more a factor of the wonderful cover art than what lies between.  Griet is a supposed innocent who balks at being painted with her mouth open but who, in a weakly established fit of psychological displacement, apparently has no qualms about pre-marital rutting in a back alley with the butcher's son. This scene, by the way, being virtually the only human and/or humane &quot;action&quot; in the entire book which is otherwise replete with mundane observations supposedly about the Vemeer family in Delft but could just as easily have been about the Van Smiths or the Van Joneses.<br />Griet is difficult to like. She is astoundingly rude and inexplicably milk-toasty by turns. She puts up with arduous, back-breaking house work but has huge qualms about piercing an ear. Chevalier's characterization of Vemeer is worse: he is presented as a unidimensional puppet. You neither care much for him, or about him. The only thing we know for sure is that he had marital relations because the Vemeers had 11 children.<br />The popularity of this book astounds me. You are better off spending your time looking at Vemeer's evocative, luminous paintings than reading this book. It is not a book for the serious reader for whom plot, character and dramatic narrative appeal.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Richie, Snatch's director, for those who don't know it is Madonna's husband. This was basically all I knew when I saw the movie the first time. This, and a very good recommendation from a peer at work.<br /> What I found was a movie that is simply brilliant. It is filled with some of the funniest scenes you have seen in a long time (top-notch humor, the type of Saturday Night Live, but British-style), and therefore deals in that way with a whole ganster-like plot with originally many separate threads, which are progressively combined in a very smart way, much like the maestro Tarantino would do.<br /> If you enjoyed &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (Richie's first movie) you'll love this one. If you haven't seen it, after you see Snatch, you'll die to see it and will love it every bit as much. Richie uses again a large part of the same cast from the first movie (including the main star, Jason Statham).<br /> The only thing I regretted was that Del Toro did not play a more important role in the movie. But then again, Pitt's rendition of the impossible-to-understand-yet-incredibly-funny gipsy was a sample of sheer genius!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Moulin Rouge is nothing short of spectacular. With some of the finest costumes, cinematography, and art direction ever to be seen. The film is directed by Baz Luhrmann whom also directed the 1996 version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;brings his gift sense of style to this movie. This is not to mention a wonderful musical score which blends contemporary hits in a traditional musical style of presentation. The only flaw in this gem is the first ten minutes of the movie, which I did not know if I was watching a comedy or a serious drama. Yet once I found my self inside the Moulin Rouge I found that this was a heart warming romance, and a tragic drama. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give there best preformances in this film, even if the majority of there lines are present though music much in the style of &quot;Evita&quot;. The story of a young man whom goes to Paris to write a story of his ideals of truth, beauty, freedom and above all love leads him to a group of eccentric artists which ask him to write a play for them. This allows our main character the chance to meet the beautifull dancer Satine, whom is the main star of the Moulin Rouge and a prostitute. Yet there love is over shadowed by a jealous and insane duke whom holds the deed to the Moulin Rouge and there very lives. The film is rated PG-13 yet this movie should have been rated R for the strong sexuality, violence language and mature themes which include a scene of rape. This film is suggested for those sixteen and up, anyone under should truely view this film with their parents.

B0000028M7|3.0|This album has been in my CD collection since 1993 and, although it used to get lots of play back then, I barely even touch it anymore.<br />The first time I heard Alice in Chains was when they released &quot;Man in the Box&quot; back in 1991. I wasn't that into the &quot;metal&quot; sound at the time (outside of maybe Guns 'N Roses - can't believe I'm admitting that) but &quot;Man in the Box&quot; was just so dark and addictive that I just had to purchase the album, &quot;Facelift.&quot; The album as a whole was a very disappointing experience; outside of &quot;Man in the Box,&quot; it consisted of bland, uninspired metal.  (But it came with a free video tape, which included the &quot;Man in the Box&quot; video, so I wasn't too upset.)<br />When AiC released &quot;Dirt&quot; in 1993, a lot had changed since their 1991 debut. The Seattle scene was huge, Lollapalooza was THE summer concert event, and AiC were one of the featured bands that year. So, although I hesitated at first, I was too caught up in grunge fever to resist giving the band another shot. &quot;Dirt&quot; was uniformly dark and addictive, creative and varied, pontificating and unique - everything that &quot;Facelift&quot; wasn't. It became a part of my regular playlist for the next few months and it was great experiencing the songs played live that summer at Lollapalooza.<br />But, of course, things continued to change: the music scene, my personal taste in music, etc. Eventually the album dropped out my regular playlist and was gradually forgotten. Now when I choose to listen to it (which is hardly ever) I never find myself as impressed as I used to be. The first half of the album really bores me. There's really no &quot;catch&quot; to any of the songs. The second half of the album definitely picks up. &quot;Dirt&quot; and &quot;Angry Chair&quot; are good songs. The lyrical theme of drug addiction, life spiraling out of control, ensuing fallout and mental/physical anguish caused by overuse and withdrawal makes for compelling subject matter and disturbing lyrics. But, although the lyrics are well-written, I can't get past Stanley's delivery - there's a whiny, tiresome quality to it that tends to wear thin. As well, the &quot;grungey&quot; guitar playing just doesn't appeal to me anymore.<br />Even though I'm not that into this album anymore, I'd definitely recommend it to those of you that like the type of hard rock that you hear on modern rock radio nowadays. AiC were a significant influence on today's hard rock bands and they did it a heck of a lot better. But if you can't stand what you hear on the radio and don't care for grunge or metal, stay away.<br />This will always be in my music collection because it was a keynote album at a memorable period in my life. However, if it hadn't been, I'd sell it to a used CD store in a second.

B000002G9S|5.0|Free was nothing if not the proof that less is more; what distinguished them from their bloozerocking peers was the point that they didn't need to shove themselves into overdrive to make their point. Minimalists in the best sense of the word, they set a legitimately funky rhythm section behind the strikingly simple but gripping guitar playing of the late Paul Kossoff and the thrusting vocals of Paul Rodgers and delivered as singular a hard bloozerock attack as could be found during their brief but bristling existence.<br />&quot;Fire and Water&quot; was their best selling album and still the album on which their reputation rests (though the predecessor, &quot;Free,&quot; was no less effective). The title track impressed Wilson Pickett enough to make a striking soul hit out of it. And &quot;All Right Now&quot; remains a masterpiece of pure rocking R and B fire; never mind Rodgers's only too classic lyric of predatory obsession-compulsion (so he doesn't get the girl in the sack, she's too smart to fall for his jive, but you know damn well it isn't going to stop him from hunting fresh prey and probably landing one less gullible), the chunky verse playing is relentless, and that classic midsection, piano and bass nudging Kossoff to his most memorably melodious solo (that's saying something considering his consistency), is impossible to resist. The album cut has long since buried the hit single version (which contained a different rhythm guitar sound, shortened up that midsection a little bit, and eliminated the second verse coda entirely; it's available on the new anthology of the band, and it's worthy in its own right), and you probably know a few dozen &quot;classic rock&quot; bar bands who give it a whirl at least once a night and get a guaranteed round of applause with it after they've cranked out a little Bad Company to whet the appetite a bit.<br />Bad Company, in fact, seems to have forged a career out of trying to recapture that lightning and exercising the frustration involved when they see it but don't quite capture it. Though they outpointed Free for commercial endurance, they never really did get their hands around &quot;Fire and Water&quot;'s lightning long enough, notwithstanding that (&quot;Straight Shooter,&quot; especially) it was occasionally fun to hear them try. Essentially, Bad Company was Free if you imagined the band merely replacing Kossoff and bassist Andy Fraser with former Mott the Hoopler Mick Ralphs (who lacked Kossoff's subtleties) and former King Crimsonite Boz Burrell (who rumbled where Fraser would have rocked) and turning their elemental flame into arena rock cliche (though Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke never really did lose their hop), but they only serve to make Free look that much better in retrospect.
B00005AXEL|4.0|i haven't been a huge stevie nicks fan - this is my first cd of hers.  i dig it!  it's one of those that grows on you.  i listened to it several times through &amp; put it away.  i enjoyed it but was generally unimpressed.  well, i've caught myself coming back to it again &amp; again, and rarely skipping songs.  if you like the 2 pop releases &quot;everyday&quot; and &quot;planets of the universe&quot; then you won't regret plunking down the cash.
B000059T1G|4.0|OK, quit carping on the &quot;contractual obligation&quot; side of the ledger and just hang onto the slapdash fun that was the final album from the first flight of Traffic. Never mind how no remastering on earth can really clean up the muddy recording of the two live cuts. Just enjoy the point that &quot;Last Exit&quot; is charming goofiness of the first order, unless you think there's some serious messagemongering going on in places like &quot;Shanghai Noodle Factory&quot; or &quot;Medicated Goo&quot;. And, enjoy the lone moment of serious introspection (the eerie &quot;Withering Tree&quot;). Who cares if their record company threw it together to fill out their first recording deal? Worse things than this have happened in such circumstances (think Spooky Tooth; more appropriately, think singer Mike Harrison's supposed-to-be first solo album, &quot;The Last Puff,&quot; which got billed as &quot;Spooky Tooth featuring Mike Harrison,&quot; effectively killing any chance Harrison might have had as a solo performer until the Tooth themselves reformed in 1972). Pass the hookah.
0553278223|5.0|I began &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; as an assignment for an English class. This was required Summer reading, and my peers who had already completed the book were quick to tell me how boring, pointless and confusing it was. As I read the first few chapters, I was sure it was going to be one of the worst books I would ever read. I am glad to say that I was plesantly surprised. I was truly drawn to this futuristic tale, and there were chapters I loved so much that I read them again and again my favorite being &quot;There will come soft rains&quot;. It's easy to see why this book is such a classic. I highly reccomend it.
0345404475|3.0|There is some good stuff here, but Dick doesn't manage to pull the threads together to form a coherent novel.  <br />The characters in Electric Sheep, both the humans and the androids, never manage to evolve beyond the level of caricatures.  This is probably the book's greatest weakness.  In Electric Sheep the androids either try to blend into society, or they huddle together like pack animals (sheep, perhaps) and wait for Deckard to come along and blast them.  They're uninteresting figures, demonstrably sub-human, and merely serve as stage dressing for Dekker's ruminations about life and death.  Perhaps this is the point, but it makes for bland reading.<br />Ridley Scott, in my opinion,,  significantly improves on the material in using Dick's novel as the inspiration for Blade Runner (see the excellent director's cut, not the studio release with the corny voice-overs and the cut-and-paste ending).<br />In the movie the roles are reversed.  It is Deckard, the human, who is the tired has-been, and who up until the very end sleepwalks through his life.  The androids, on the other hand, are the passionate ones.  They are the ones trying to answer the big questions: &quot;How much time do I have left?&quot; &quot;What is my relationship with my creator?&quot; &quot;How can I extend my life?&quot;  It is through watching the androids and their passion for life, killing, and finally mercy, that Deckard begins to ask what it means to be &quot;alive&quot;.  <br />Electric Sheep was published in 1968, but the writing already comes across as dated, which would keep the novel from ranking high as literature (timelessness being a prerequisite).  In the end Dick's capacity to invent an interesting concept far exceeds his ability to deliver.  The prose reads, largely, like drugstore pulp.  The action scenes are anti-climatic and unbelievable, and the characters are flat.  There are some interesting ideas here: Mercerism as a controlling shared-experience technology based religion; empathy as the most valued of human emotions; the conversion of the class system and prejudice against &quot;specials&quot; - but those ideas just float around and are never really developed.
B000002K9N|5.0|Maybe not as intimate as SINATRA AND SEXTET, SINATRA AT THE SANDS makes up for by presenting the entire show from one of the pinnacles of Sinatra's multi-faceted career: the Vegas years.<br />The Voice is in prime order, and the tunes, with a couple of exceptions, are the romantic, victorious Pop of Sinatra's golden age.  The vocal-horn interchange on &quot;I've Got A Crush On You&quot; gets funnier with repeated listenings; the saloon song of the night--Sinatra calls it a &quot;drunk song&quot; here--is &quot;One For My Baby,&quot; which I've always considered thE signature Sinatra tune.  He handles it masterfully here.<br />I still like Mary Richards version best, though.<br />As for the patter, I could do without some of it, but what the heck--at this point, 35 years down the road, it's kind of nice to have this kind of thing documented.  If you've heard the Rat Pack tapes and know some of Dean Martin's act, some of Sammy Davis Jr's act, you know the three were really in each other's pockets and were borrowing material back and forth quite a bit.
044022165X|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly; plowed through it in a week which is good for me.  I thought the book was very funny at times, in fact at one point I started bursting out in laughter while taking the train home from downtown Chicago; I think a few people were looking at me, but I didn't care.<br />I thought the judges bias against Great Benefit and Leo Drummond was a bit out of hand.  It seemed as though old Leo couldn't say a word without Judge Kipley having some king of reprimand for him.  I was not on the insurance company's side (Who could be?), but I thought this was a bit unrealistic.<br />Also, after the trial was over there were about 20 pages left and I knew that this was going to be some kind of interesting ending with Kelly.  Sure enough, Rudy kills her hubby in self defense and Kelly ends up taking the rap.  The ending, however, is disappointing.  I was expecting some kind of surprise at the end; not there.  Rudy simply plots and strategizes and presto, Kelly is out of jail and they ride off into the sunset, literally drove off west.<br />Overall, I loved the book and highly recommend it.
B00005B4GU|4.0|You are a rock band from Oxford, just a humble university town that isn't known for much else. Your band makes an unassuming pop-rock album that gives you airtime all Europe and America; one of your songs becomes a major hit. But you know better than that. Trying to get away from pop, your band makes another record that ditches popular sounds and goes into experimental territory. Too bad it doesn't sell as good as your last record, but you realize that you're gaining a big following. So what do you do? You hire a great producer, lock yourself in an old mansion and explore deeper themes through; you also stumble upon sampling and electronica. By the time you release it, your band is instantly praised by the press as the next biggest thing--sometimes even the BIGGEST thing out there.   <br />You go on a world tour, grow tired of endless shows, endless reviews, endless interviews; sooner or later, the inhuman themes that your band displayed in your big album is beginning to happen to you. You don't know if you can take this anymore. Modern music becomes quickly dull, unoriginal, bland. You need something to vent your anger with, and you decide to go into a totally different direction. Your next album is virtually void of guitars, is even more apocolyptic than your last, and is as dark as the artwork you've put all over the booklet. It gets mixed reviews--people love it or hate it--but it cements your band's name more into the public conscious.<br /> How do you compete with that?<br /> Radiohead's fifth release, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; sums up what the band recorded during the Kid A sessions, yet felt somehow didn't fit into &quot;Kid A&quot;'s mold of silent rage. Yet let it beware that &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is no &quot;Kid B;&quot; it's &quot;Kid Z&quot; more like it. Unlike the last release, we find guitars turned up, more somber pianos and an outburst of New Orleans funeral jazz at the end. On the other hand, we also find much of the same electronic tempos that we all heard off &quot;Kid A,&quot; making the two albums sound like they both came from the same family, but are first or second cousins.<br />The downbeat &quot;Packt Like Sardines&quot; opens up the record with somber synths and am electronic trip-hop beat. &quot;After years of waiting/nothing came,&quot; sings Yorke, before ultimately warning the listener to &quot;...Get off my case.&quot; The isolation he felt after &quot;OK Computer&quot; still seems to be a part of him. <br />The dreamy, post-apocolyptic &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; brings the listener into the river, seeing all their pasts and futures after the climax of death; like the video, which shows someone diving into an unnamed underwater North American city after the end of civilization, we find Radiohead's fears of global destruction and death itself. However, we are calmly reminded to the warm words of &quot;There is nothing to fear/and nothing to doubt.&quot; However, the next track, &quot;Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors&quot; is a loud jolt back into a reality of ever-changing doors, pulsating with distorted vocals and a brutal hard beat with little pause, showing a great amount of Massive Attack, Aphex Twin and Nine Inch Nails influence.<br /> &quot;Amnesiac&quot; rolls on with the pleasing &quot;You and Whose Army,&quot; a shot at Tony Blair and the uber-bureaucratic European Union (comparing it to the ultimately doomed 16th century Holy Roman Empire). We encounter more songs along the way; the radio-friendly &quot;I Migh Be Wrong,&quot; a delicious mix of dirty American blues and underground British techno. &quot;Knieves Out&quot; and &quot;Dollars Cents&quot; create the most &quot;OK Computer&quot;-like songs on the record with their rushed pace and whispful vocals, while &quot;Morning Bell-Amnesiac&quot; sounds like it came directly from either a child's nightmare or a Tim Burton film. <br /> Yet the most experimental track (aside from &quot;Pull/Pulk&quot;) is &quot;Like Spinning Plates;&quot; Yorke's vocals recorded backwards and then played forward to give it an eerie imperfect feel. It's synths also sounding backwards, as if it were being played the other way round on the turntable. It continues before finally being subdued by the funeral march of &quot;Life in a Glasshouse,&quot; <br /> &quot;Amnesiac&quot; fails to let down the listener, but it's almost impossible to not have the same feelings you had when you first listened to &quot;Kid A&quot; on your mind when you listen to this. But unlike &quot;Kid A,&quot; &quot;Amnesaic&quot; carries a more forward approach to songs rather than the storyline epic of &quot;Kid A.&quot; But still, the amnesiac's of the world will not be disappointed.
B0000033OZ|2.0|Emmerson, Lake and Palmer were one of the worst examples of a 1970s supergroup.  They had the same problem that would befall Yes in that they often forgot to infuse their songs with a decent melody and they just didn't know when to quit.  Mercifully, the idea of combining classic music and rock music died a quarter of a century ago, and ELP were the lead pallbearers at the funeral.  This album, their debut, contains their best song, the decent and catchy &quot;Lucky Man.&quot;  Beyond that you get a lot of aimless noodling and pointless soloing.  At least Yes put together a couple of very strong albums before decending into mediocrity.  ELP was there at the start.
0780625129|2.0|The premise of this film is that is about the &#8220;redemption&#8221; of an &#8220;evil NAZI\\" skinhead named Derek Vineyard.  One would take that to mean the film is anti-racist, but I have found a few problems in the movie with that.  Number one the movie does not deal with the higher intellectual elements of the National Socialist movement, there is really no discussion on the nature of jews or revisionist ideals on the so called holocaust.  What it does deal with are real concerns of white Americans and it presents a great deal of the basic argument of White Nationalists.  The movie is also unbelievable and unconvincing with its &#8220;anti-hate&#8221; message.  For example, Derek gives a speech to a number of young skinheads on illegal immigration from Mexico.  All of the facts he gives in the speech are correct and true facts that any citizen can get a hold of with a little research.  Nothing in the film ever attempts to disprove or discredit these statements, save that after the speech the skins go tear up a Asian owned store.  The message of &#8220;dissent on illegal immigration or the protection of American borders leads to violence&#8221; is not going to pan out with any half way intelligent person.  It does leave, however, the viewer with a strong impression of the problems America faces because of illegals.   The movie also serves to reinforce many racialist ideas.  Another example is that blacks and other nonwhites can settle a dispute with no other means that violence.  When Cameron and Seth are beaten up because of their views it strongly supports the above statement.  Or when Danny is shot by the black in the bathroom because he wouldn&#8217;t stand down to him.  Derek&#8217;s sister holds very liberal views which would be viewed as pathetic by even mainstream conservatives.  These views are pretty well trashed during the dinner scene, where the jewish boyfriend makes a foolof himself.  The same retort of &#8220;racist ideals lead to violence&#8221;is used as Derek slaps around on his sister a bit.  This again is not going to fly with half way intelligent people who know that it is possible to disagree without beating someone.  The only minority characters that are not portrayed as not being scum are Dr. Sweeny and Derek&#8217;s black friend in prison.  Dr. Sweeny is unconvincing at best and his statements are somewhat illogical.  For instance Sweeny says, &#8220;is anything you are doing making your life better?&#8221;  A simple reply would be that if one believed an all white community was better than a mixed community then everything he was doing was to make his life better.  Derek&#8217;s black prison friend steps in to save him after his NAZI friends in prison disown him.  I do not care what your political persuasions are, if you are in prison and deserve to be you are probably not of the best character.  So it is no far step that a bunch of prison thugs who happen to have swastikas tattooed on them are not a convincing as a reason to change the ideas of a serious racialist.  However, the agreeable personality of one black in the movie does not do much to change the light that is shed on minorities. To conclude this film is completely unbelievable.  It in no way shows why the views of Derek Vineyard are incorrect and never presents a clear path to the reasons why he changed them.  The only little micro suggestion it presents is that Cameron was not as committed a National Socialist as he would have his followers believe.  But just because one Christian is bad doesn&#8217;t make the religion bad.
B00005B6NC|5.0|Woo hoo this movie was scary! Things are not what they seem, and when you figure out what it is, it's worse than what you thought. It's like the most hideous nightmare, being &quot;out-there&quot; in the dark with things trying to get you, plus you've got a violent convicted murderer to worry about too. But,let me tell you, I'd love to meet this dude in a dark alley! Ladies, see the movie, even if it's just to get a gander at Riddick (Vin Diesel). I found the movie to be very enjoyable and well worth seeing again and again, but then, I am a total Vin Diesel Addict, so I guess I'm a tad jaded when it comes to my opinions.   Again, I loved the movie, Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell were awesome!

0783113943|4.0|This movie is how I found this actress. Not only was she awesome in this...This movie was so intense and interesting. Kinda makes you feel like your life is boring when you watch the character's. This model had some interesting life.
B00003CX6P|5.0|Maybe one of the dominant themes in this film is: who is preying upon whom?<br />  No film is made without a message...or several messages... attached to it.  Some of these are overt...some are hidden... some are intended...some creep out because the film is made in a cultural context or time period which themselves speak a message of attitudes and values...<br />   As an American viewer, one might be prone to look on Dickie and Marge as living the \\"good life\\" (though the word \\"good\\" certainly would take on ironic and sardonic colorings if used in connection with any sense of values or ethics...) ...and Tom Ripley would seem to be the unwanted, predatory, disruptive, and destructive element which brings havoc into the \\"sweet life\\" arena...<br />  But Marge has already caught onto Dickie's ways and means...her frank sharing with Tom aboard the boat about how Dickie \\"picks people up,\\" amuses himself with their novelty, makes them feel so special while his attention is on them, and then drops them when they no longer interest or amuse him...is a devastating insight...especially when it comes from the lips of someone who believes she loves him...<br />  So all is not well in the American compound...on Italy's sunny shores...    We should, however, think of ourselves -- as a country and as a people -- as we might be viewed through the eyes of others.. in the world...not from the self-defending, close-minded idea that \\"Ah, they're just jealous that they're not us... don't have what we have...aren't rich and 'free' to live lives of pleasure and eating and drinking...\\"<br />   The question is, amid all the beautiful scenery and the chance to understand another culture...with its history and art and values, how much are these rich (but only because of Daddy's money, of course, not because of any work or ingenuity they have used to create their own wealth)Americans impacting this culture and society into which they have intruded themselves?...of course, it must be faulted that the society around them is all too eager to soak up their dollars...<br />  And what culture and knowledge and values are the Americans bringing into their foreign surroundings to share with the natives there?  <br />   Ironically, it is only Tom Ripley who has any sense of the beauty and art around him...we see him wandering around by himself in Rome, while Dickie and Frankie spend their time sealed inside music listening booths listening to jazz recordings...Tom, by himself...alone...is wandering to see the remains of monumental statues of Italy's Roman past...and then sitting in the beauty of an evening sunset looking down on the remains of the Roman Forum... only he, of the group, seems to have any sense of art or beauty...    It is at this point that one might begin to think about the director of the film...of his perspective...of his sense of life and meaning...and values...    What messages, either overt or hidden, is the director putting into his film about the times and the people he is making his film about?  <br />   What do the Americans in this film bring into the foreign setting?  What is their effect on the surrounding culture and people?  Is it beneficial and contributive and positive... or is it parasitic, predatory, and negative?<br />   In Henry James' novels, one might get the idea that it is naive Americans coming to wily, decadent, predatory Europe who might receive a revelation from their experience... but in this turn-around point of view, it is the callous, cynical Americans lounging and hunching around the beaches and waters of sunny Italy...buying or renting villas...carrying on destructive affairs with the locals...throwing money around to buy...and supposedly create a sense of their own importance...who, unfortunately, may bring the sad revelations to anyone who will see through their glitz and hedonism...
0767818040|5.0|Brian De Palma takes the unique voyeurism in Rear Window and twists it into a completely intriguing original story of his own, I will say that it was wrong of De Palma to take the kiss scene from Vertigo.  There are some things that you just can't touch.  De Palma still makes a great movie and the Hitchcockian similarities are only in the camera angles when you get right down to it.
B000059XYM|1.0|I am a big fan of alot of genres including stupid comedies like biodome,Bill and ted, airplane, and son in law. But while I can take and even enjoy a mild amount of sick jokes, this crossed the line by about 50 miles. The saddest thing was that this was a hit. There were a few chuckles and one huge laugh,the wazzup scene, but otherwise it was just people making fun of small penises, penisis caught in thongs, and more penises. If you want a horror parody go see &quot;Shreik if you know what I did last friday the 13th&quot;.How this was not rated x I will never know. If this is where societies headed the human race should not survive.JUST SAY NO!!!!

B00003CX5P|1.0|I love Star Wars, saw the  Phantom Menace at Universal Studious Cinemas, California, when it was release on the first day. The supposedly great computer generated special effects made the film look like a cheesy computer game. Worst of all, Jar-Jar Binks was so annoying and I certainly feel that Darth Mau would have immediately increase the rating on the film if he would have cut Jar-Jar into pieces in the first scene. They no longer do things like they used to, in terms of quality. The first 3 Starwars film will always be great, however, Episod 1 is certainly a Menace for the Star Wars collection. Hopefully Episod 2 is a lot better, I am certainly not looking forward to seeing Jar-Jar, unless of course it involves the new Darth Mau doing us a favour, sending him back to where he came from, below ground level.
B00003CXN4|1.0|I just watch Traffic, and I have to say it is nothing like the reviews had to say about it being a Masterpiece, Just as big as the God Father Epic, A Flat-out Electrifying Experience, Scenes play like tubo-charged versions of real life, and blah blah blah!!! <br />I did not like the movie, because they did a very bad job of story telling! I could not get into, or feel for any of the characters in this story. There was a lot at stake for the characters in Traffic, but they did not give you a performance that there was anything at stake at all. <br />I will touch, on my other reasons why I did not like this movie by naming the four Academy Awards that they got this year. <br />Best Director: how did Steven Soderbergh get this award? Did the people really watch the movie. I still believe it should have gone to Ang Lee, or even Ridley Scott, because they did tell a better story that had better direction than Traffic. Sure, Traffic has direction, tries to sound smart, but I believe it failed doing so. How did if fail? I believed it failed by doing too much, trying to tell too many stories, and pulling them all together into one in the end. I am sure if they worked on it a little longer, they could tell a better story. <br />Best Adapted Screenplay: Give me a break, and send me to the moon!!! Once again, they could have told a better story, if they seem took their time to write it out. I was reading the information inside the DVD cover, and it look like they did work on it for some time, but there was something missing in it. So, I have to go back to the performances again. The performances did not seem real to me, it was like yeah whatever, just get off my case!! <br />In addition, they got the idea from a TV miniseries called \\"Traffik\\" in the early 80's. For some reason this does not set well for me, it just seems to me not too much work is happening here. Because that is one of the first things we do in writing class, is taking stories and rewrite them, its not that hard of an task to do...<br />Best Supporting Actor: I felt nothing from Benicio Del Toro, in his role as a Mexican Cop. There was one time in the movie that I did felt something from him, and that is in the end. I have to say that was the best part, because the ending was very moving. His performance as a whole was so so to not much. I thought Joaqun Phoenix played a stronger roll and should of got Best Supporting Actor! <br />Best Film Editing: YAK!!! and i YAK AGAIN!!!! I have not seen soooooo many bad editing job in my life, it made movies like The Blair Witch Project, and Plan 9 From Outer Space look great! There was not much to any action in this movie to make people look good at in what they are doing. Therefore, they shot one or two bullets, and blow up a car big whip/tea doooo. I mean if they are going to give out this award for film editing, give it to somebody that Had to do Hard Work to make things look real and believable...<br />So, I ask what was the big haa/doo with Traffic? The only thing I can think of, it was really a pro drug story more than an anti drug story. No one is clean, so don't judge me. Is what I got from this story. <br />I watch it twice trying to find the magic behind this movie, and I could not. <br />I did not care about how it was filmed using a dirty black and white in Mexico, and using clear clean Color in the USA. I was amazed; however, to see that the characters did change colors when they went from Mexico to the US, talking about not staying in character. LOL!! <br />I believe what would have made the movie better, is by doing less with it.  I believe they would have had a great story by keeping it in Mexico, I think that was there strong suit in the movie. <br />If anything this was Soderbergh Pulp Fiction! and for that I give him one star for his effort...
B000002UB3|5.0|This album is wonderfull.  It has enteresting and sometimes unusual songs,  I love &quot;Come together&quot; and &quot;I Want You(She's so heavy).&quot;Maxwells Silver hammer is a kinda unusual and wierd(Just plain silly Lyrics)  Octopus garden is anothar of my favs.  Love how some songs bridge from one too the other.  And Her magesty is... REALLY SHORT(25 to 30 Seconds). Just one question... Why is &quot;The End&quot; Second too the last and her magesty as last(track),  The song IS called &quot;The end&quot;, Why Didn't they put it on the end.....<br />Get this album
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I must say I was rather disapointed when I first listened to the soundtrack.  I could not believe that the CD did not contain &quot;Spectacular! Spectacular!&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, or &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.  This is not to say that the CD is bad.  It is still a GREAT soundtrack, but I do hope that true Broadway style musical soundtrack is released also.  I mean John Lenguizamo's plaintive &quot;Nature Boy&quot; from the movie is just SO different from David Bowie's and the CD also doesn't have the great intro speech that Ewan does before he belts out &quot;Your Song&quot;.  If any of the recording execs are reading this...PLEASE RELEASE A FULL MOVIE SOUNDTRACK!!  But until they do, buy the soundtrack that is out now, and watch Moulin Rouge as many times as you possibly can to get your fill of the other songs (^-^).
0790734591|5.0|Awesome action movie!  If you liked DIE HARD, you'll love this!  I really reccommend this movie!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible! I love every single song on it - even the French/English song by Rufus Wainwright! Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both prove that they can belt out a song beautifully.<br />I love that songs from the movie have been included - but where is the dialogue that precedes each musical number? Oftentimes, the preceding dialogue adds to the song - it is sorely missed! David Bowie's \\"Nature Boy\\" is eerily haunting - it gives me the chills. But the film version feautring John Leguizamo would have been a better representation of the movie soundtrack. And \\"Roxanne\\" is so heated and heartfelt - I can picture the movie cutting between a torn Christian, a terrified Satine and the dancing on the Moulin Rouge dance floor. It places the images into your head beautifully!<br />Though it is missing some of the songs I loved best, it is still an awesome CD and an even better movie - I recommened both and give them each 5 stars. *****
B0000399WI|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE THREE TIMES , AND I AM BUYING THE MOVIE SO I CAN WATCH IT MENY MORE TIMES TO COME. I HARDLY WATCH MOVIES MORE THAN TWO TIMES. I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS VERY WELL DONE. DAVID
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey road, in my opinion, is Great.  One of my favorites(My fav is RUBBER SOUL).  There are some interesting songs on it.  &quot;I want you&quot; has a very sudden ending, It doesn't fade away like most songs, Or end with a chord strum, It just ends, Like someone stopped the recording all of a sudden.  Also, Some of the songs bridge from one to the other, you can't really tell were one ends and the other begins,  Mean mister mustard bridges over into Polytheme Pam than that bridges into She came in through the bathroom window.  The first time i really listened to it(the album) i thought that i was listening to one song(When i listened to mean Mr. mustard and Polythem Pam And She came in through the bathroom window) Untill I heard them start singing&quot;SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW&quot; and then(knowing that She camin thr.....) Was the name of another song i looked up at the CD player and saw that i was no longer on Track,11 but on 13.  Also, her magesty is enteresting,  It is the shortest song i have ever heard, Only about like 40 seconds or something, most songs las at least a minute.  It also has a very sudden begining.... As if Someone had been recording another song than stopped the recording right before the last strum and then started it as soon as the played it than they played her magesty. A bit as if it is  bridging from another song . But it not.<br />As i said, this album is great.... Get it
0767830520|5.0|This is a brilliant film with, in my humble opinion De Niros best performance ever. He plays the original loner who prophesises that one day a \\"real rain will come\\" to N.Y and wash the \\"filth\\" from the streets. As he's an insomniac he gets a job as a Taxi Driver working late nights in the worst parts of town. he sees things that anger him and throughout the film he is drifting further and further away from reality. He forms an unsteady relationship with a beautiful woman named Betsy. And meets a teen prostitute (Foster) whom he is intent on rescuing from her controlling pimp (Keitel). Oh and he takes a slight interest in guns somewhere along the way. A brilliant film from a brilliant collaboration.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This may very likely be the most truthful film on drug addiction and its grave consequences on the body, mind and soul. Darren Aronofsky's approach to this topic is engaging and stigmatizing. Using the arena of drug addiction, the film very persuasively depicts how innocence can be corrupted and how human dignity can be poisoned when a life has fear and uncertainty with no real sense of purpose. Aronofsky's approach to this film, like a good theatrical play, leaves you with a lasting sense of urgency on today's pop culture. The performances by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans were very good but it must be said that the foundation of this film was Ellen Burstyn's acting. Her portrayal of the mother in the film is simply mesmerizing. It's obvious that she put in much heart and soul in her acting for this film. At times I lost the sence of watching a film and felt that I was experiencing a first hand view of a woman completely falling apart from her uncontrolled use of &quot;acid&quot; pills.  Perhaps its because we no longer experience acting of this calliper anymore, just mere shallow performances dressed up with sensational special effects. It's unfortunate that Ellen Burstyn didn't win the Oscar for Best Actress in this film. However, it's even more unfortunate for the Oscar committee for lacking the insight and wisdom in not rewarding such splendid acting.
B00005ASOC|2.0|There is nothing bad about \\"Finding Forrester\\" as a film at all... There is nothing exceptional about it either.<br />The film is weighed down by its simularities to several other releases such as \\"Good Will Hunting\\", \\"Scent of a Woman\\", and even \\"With Honors\\".<br />The story revolves around a high school basketball star who happens to be a closet literary genius who is befriended by reclusive pulitzer prize winning novelist Sean Connery...<br />The legend Connery must come out of hiding to vindicate the writing of his young apprentice in a sceen far less climactic than the pace of the story itself.<br />The relationship between the old writer and the young one is the core of the film and it is this core that holds the viewer captive awaiting  the promise of the film.  What could of been a fine story of friendship is watered down and lost in the subplots of basketball games and ego clashes with villianous school faculty members...<br />The sceens that take place between Connery and his pupil make the film worth viewing but there is just not enough new material to merit the films own worthiness... 2 stars.
B00000G09Q|5.0|i love this movie it is cute! i really like it when they go to japan it is so funny. raphel makes a new friend while in japan his friend is named yoshi he is a litle boy. And leo saves him from the fire. mike also makes a new friend i think he had a crush on her hehe. well all and all i think this is a great movie and great for all turtle fans.
B00000DGUG|3.0|I must say the first time that I heard the first 4 tracks of Jagged Little Pill, I absolutely thought, this is going to be SO BIG!  Let me make this review short and sweet and say that I love Alanis.  Her concerts are wonderful, and there will never be another Jagged Little Pill.  However, with SFIJ, there are some really good tracks on here that are suitable for a mix tape, but to listen to this entire album at one time really starts to itch at my skin.
6305169187|5.0|Although I prefer Deep Impact, because it has more about average people in it, Armageddon is still excellent. The characters (especially the roughnecks) are fascinating, the dialogue is snappy, and it combines tear-jerking with triumph in the ending.
6304233639|4.0|Granted, it doesn't have the most complex or thought out script ever made, but this movie is fun.  Great to just pop in and enjoy without worring if you missed anything.
0452282152|3.0|I liked this book, but after reading reviews and seeing it on the Best Seller's Lists, I was very surprised by it.  It was entertaining and somewhat informative, but frankly, it read like a grade school book. It took me less than two hours to begin and finish it, and I was even trying to ready slowly!  I don't know if I will be as willing to try another book by this author.
B00003CXRP|1.0|...<br />Although the film was beautifully made with some fantastic shots on the island, there are few times that I have been more bored.<br />If you do watch it, be prepared for an hour of minimal dialogue. There is a well acted scene by Tom Hanks where he gets very excited about the fire he builds.  The rest of the dialogue is with Wilson the volleyball.  There was a moment that held my interest briefly when he casted Wilson away after realizing his situation in talking with a volleyball but soon retrieves it.  &quot;Wake me when he's off the island,&quot; is what some of you may say.<br />The third act doesn't get much better.  I almost quit watching it but thought that it may redeem itself with a cool ending....
B000059PR5|5.0|This movie avoids one of the problems I often see with end-of-the-world type stories: failing to focus on the common people. In ARMAGEDDON and DEEP IMPACT, we spend a lot of time watching astronauts and presidents, rather than the average Joe.<br />In THE DAY AFTER, it is all about common people, and how they deal with catastrophe.<br />The suspense and disbelief prior to launch is believable, the actual launch is heart-stoppingly poignant. The aftermath devolves into a hopelessly depressing morass, but even in that it is horribly realistic.<br />For those who want to take an unflinching look at a possible future, I highly recommend this movie.
B00005CDUE|3.0|Clearly released to support their current tour, this album provides a new fan with an excellent opportunity to acquaint themselves with Roxy Music.  That being said, there is no reason whatsoever for any other fan to purchase this, unless you are really bent on having some sort of complete collection. These songs are all on other albums. Even the single Pyjamarama is found on the Street Life compilation released a few years after the groups '83 breakup. This compilation is well put together though, making it arguably the best get-acquainted compilation of Roxy work to date.  There are some mysteries though, like why Same Old Scene was included instead of say, Editions of You or a third song off the glistening Avalon album.  Recommended only for new fans.
0060392886|5.0|I highly recommend your purchasing The Dirt.  Once I began, I simply could not put it down (finished in 4 days).  Written in a free-flowing, conversational style with intertwining perspective from each member (and their unwitting victims), The Dirt is refreshingly honest - to the point of being raw, sometimes sad, and often very funny.  In fact, Mick Mars (unexpectedly) owns quite a wry sense of humor and many hearty laughs came from reading his off-beat perspectives.  In the end, you learn a lot more about the members of Motley Crue and their half-baked adventures, trials and tribulations.  We all know about the sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll (though not to the extent described by them).  However, the book also delves into areas you didn't expect to tap into -- their heart, soul, fears, failures, personal loss, hopes and dreams.  Look, I became a member of the CRUE ARMY at the not so tender age of 14.  I am proud to say that after reading this book I have reinlisted and I am rooting for (and with) Nikki and the Crue to take over the world --- AGAIN!   If you have never thought yourself a Motley Crue fan, I challenge you to get Dirt(y)!
B00003CXSP|1.0|Hannibal was one of the worst over hyped [movies] I have ever seen... The movie took so long to finally show the star himself Hannibal. Too many boring moments in the movie and a lot of scenes that do  not mean anything. The death scenes are way over reacted, and to see such an old man like Hopkins be portrayed as so dangerous, seems funny to me. The movie trys to gross people out but I've seen worst from the childish Friday the 13th movies. The movie felt long and boring and I could not wait to leave the movie theater once it was over. Do yourself a favor and bi-pass this one...
0792153189|5.0|This movie deals more (though not quite enough, in my opinion) with the reactions of ordinary people to impending disaster. Astronauts and presidents are all fine and well, but what I really want to know is what the family down the street would do in this scenario.<br />While Deep Impact didn't go into it as much as I would like, it was still good, and fairly realistic. For instance, did you know there really is an underground complex (although it's in Kansas, not Missouri, I believe).
0679905278|5.0|We just gave this book to our son on his 18th birthday.<br />It was great!  This is one of those books that's appropriate for just about any age, since the present moment is the beginning of the rest of our lives whether we're four or sixty, and the possibilities are there for most everyone.<br />At his party we passed the book around and everyone read a paragraph or two and held up the book so we all could see the accompanying drawings.<br />It was terrific, with both lots of laughs and, from him, tears.  (And the remembrance now pulling my heartstrings.)
B00003RQNJ|5.0|BC&amp;SK passes the test of time: cinematography is beautiful, editing is absolutely modern, Bacharach's music is always fascinating, Newman and Redford need no introduction. this DVD edition is worth buying because the video looks excellent and the audio track - while mono - is good. The special features are exceptional: audio commentary and documentary are perfect.
6302649943|5.0|This movie stands out as one of the few movies to be based on a stephen king book that is surprisingly good.Tim curry was very good as pennywise and so are the rest of the characters.I'm not afraid of clowns not even the mean and scary ones,but this clown for some reason spooks me out sometimes edspecially when he has those glowing eyes and those nasty long sharp teeth. ....As usual though in most of Stephen King's addapted movies this movie is very long 3 hours and 12 minutes,but theres soo much going on it doesn't seem that long and it follows the book pretty well ... ....Good make-up too.
6305718903|4.0|Although the over-all cinematography in this one was dark and dreary, the storyline was excellent. It has cutting insights into modern religion, comparing them unfavorably with Christ's original intentions.<br />The concept of a non-Catholic suffering from stigmata, and a dubious priest confronting a side of religion he hadn't previously encountered, is original and fascinating.
B000003CKH|4.0|I am surprised how good this CD is. The song The Distance is really good, and I Will Survive, although it says [bad words], when it didn't really need to, i still think it's good. Speaking of cussing, listen to Nugget if you want to hear [bad words]atleast 10 times.. Haha, I'm not dissing the CD, I lvoe cussing, so BUY IT!
0671024256|5.0|There are two legitimate models of writing: intuitive where the writer sits down and lets the story unfold as it is written (with massive revision later) and methodical where the writer first outlines the story, composing plot, theme, and other literary elements before the story itself is actually written in its entirety. There are best sellers in both camps.<br />King is an intuitive writer and methodical writers will struggle with his outlook on the craft of writing. For intuitive writers, King is a wonder. The reason he gives a biographical study is that for intuitive writers, the story comes from within, crafted from their early experiences and filtered through a creative mind. With his childhood memory of the babysitter with \\"a dangerous sense of humor\\" and the demonic doctor treating the endless ear infections, it's no wonder King can pound out a story that keeps most people up at nights, mostly making it up as he goes.<br />Regardless, of your writing style, the most valuable part of the book for anybody is King's closing chapter on editing. Beginning writers and even professionals have something to learn from reading an unedited fragment of one of King's stories and taking note how he edits it to make it tighter.<br />One caveat. King has a propensity to use strong language which may be distracting to some readers. Reading his book reminds me of having lunch with a beloved, but blunt, Dutch uncle. The advice may sting at times and the topic may wander, but you'll walk away from the experience a better writer if you're willing to be teachable.
B0000399WI|2.0|I'm still trying to figure out why so many people absolutely LOVE this film and think it's the best ever and why it inspires such fierce loyalty.  (Kinda like *the Green Mile* - but that film was positively awful :(<br />Overall, I liked *The Shawshank Redemption* - key word &quot;liked&quot;.  It was entertaining, interesting, I tolerated its overly-sugary and sentimental nature well (this movie is kinda like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles for the soul :) but ....... parts of it were stupid however; no big thing.  So for me that makes it an average movie.<br />My personal suspicion is that as those who thought this movie to be a five star gem become less depressed and in need of sugary sentimentalized &quot;hopeful&quot; stories, they will see this movie more objectively and not as &quot;the greatest and most perfect film ever in the entire history of movie-making.&quot;  It will be less of an emotional rescuer or pick-me-up for them, and thereby they will be less prone to idealize and deify this movie and heap accolades on it.<br />Or maybe I just need to be more emotionally in need of inspiration and hope in order to get this &quot;remarkable&quot; film.  Could be ................
B00004XQP4|1.0|get the single for &quot;Warning,&quot;  then wait for the next album.  It might be another &quot;Nimrod&quot;.
6305078564|5.0|This production was absolutly wonderful.  I have owned it for less than a week and have viewed it two times which is a great compliement since the movie lasts six hours.  The cast was perfect, Elizabeth and Darcy especailly, the plot was in line wiht the book at all times, or as much as possible considering it was a movie.  Any Pride and Prejudice lover will love this production, it is a much have.
B000050FEN|5.0|*Se7en* is screenwriter Walker's &quot;love letter&quot; to the city of New York.  And what a wonderful love letter it turns out to be!<br />The acting is all around superb.  Fincher's directing is brilliant.  The portrayal of modern city life and human relations is very much on the mark - apathy.  The extra features on the DVD have turned out to be very, very interesting thus far.<br />The problem?  The ending.  It doesn't make sense.  The first five deaths are supposedly because of the victims' own vices.  The last two are because of someone else's vices.  That alone makes the ending a disappointment - it seems that it was more for shock value than substance.  Which is really too bad considering the great substantiative dialogue and interaction that occurs just previous to the finale.<br />Walker should have spent more time coming up with an ending that actually fit with the rationale of the first five murders.  The ending that he came up with is a let down.<br />Other than that, the movie is superb.  Five stars.  Enjoy on an empty stomach :)
B0000025CP|5.0|The biggest improvement on this one is the sound.Im not sure if they changed their sound or if it was produced differently.Either way a much more solid package.Lots of great songs although you wont see them on a Best Of compilation.Sinner,Better than you,Saints in Hell,Beyond the Realms, and Savage are excellent material.Many of the songs feature changing rhythms.A definite plus.No monotny here.Someone else mentioned that Saints in Hell sounds like it belongs on a Mercyful Fate album.Very true.I wonder if Priest had some influence on Fate.Anyway, great song.What can be said about the solo on Realms.Favorite part of the song.This cd is probably the best material overall as far as lyrics,rhythms, and of course sound.
B000002MP2|5.0|I'm mainly a rap fan, however, I always liked &quot;when i come around&quot; and &quot;Longview&quot; so i asked my friend to burn me Dookie.  I figured it would be pretty good but probably too heavy for me.  I was wrong.  Although some songs are heavy at times, this cd is mainly great, somewhat soft punk.  Excluding track 6, this CD is flawless.  The best three though are &quot;Longview,&quot; &quot;Basket Case,&quot; and &quot;Burnout.&quot;  This is probably the best rock CD of all time.
B000003ER4|4.0|I bought this recording in preparation for attending a perfomance of the New York City Opera's wonderful production of Korngold's once wildly popular opera, a work that is now nearly forgotten. After hearing (and then seeing) Die Tote Stadt, I am astonished that this gorgeous, evocative, atmospheric musical theater piece is not performed more frequently in the States. <br />To compare the composer's style to that of other opera composers is surely to do him an injustice but perhaps it will tempt you to listen to this exquisite piece to say that Korngold's music combines the sweeping romantic lyricism of Puccini with the sophisticated tonalities and lush orchestrations of Richard Strauss.<br />The outline of the story is simple, or so it seems at first: a man who is obsessed with the memory of his dead wife meets a singer whose resemblence to her drives him to pursue the woman at a terrible cost. By means of flashbacks and dream sequences, the composer draws us into a hallucinatory world where the future becomes the past and appearences are always deceiving. The haunting \\"Marietta's Lied\\" weaves a golden thread through this imaginative and beautiful score and the melody's reprise at the end of the opera is emotionally wrenching, one of the most powerful moments in modern opera.<br />Rene Kollo's voice is unfortunately past its prime here, and this, as well as his rather flat characterization of the lead character slightly mars an otherwise fine recording.<br />Die Tote Stadt is a story about love and loss, regret, resignation, rejunvenation and hope. Truly, this is a neglected masterpiece!
0790743213|5.0|Although Hitchcock's &quot;North By Northwest&quot; is primarily thought of as a Cary Grant movie, I first saw this movie because I was very interested in Martin Landau.  &quot;North By Northwest&quot; is one of the great spy films.<br />Madison Avenue executive Cary Grant is mistaken for a government agent by a group of communist spies led by James Mason.  Grant ultimately ends up being chased around the United States and meets femme fatale Eva Marie Saint along the way.<br />&quot;NBN&quot; features an excellent cast.  The leading players are perfect: Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau, Leo G. Carrol, and Jesse Royce Landis.  Mason is excellent as the suave and evil Phillip Vandamm but Martin Landau is particularly creepy as his henchman Leonard.  Nearly forty years later, he would win an Oscar for &quot;Ed Wood,&quot; but &quot;NBN&quot; is the real film that featured Landau at his finest hour.  There are few actors who look as naturally spooky as Landau.  With his gaunt frame and haunted blue eyes, Landau is the perfect heavy.  If he had not played Rollin Hand on TV's &quot;Mission: Impossible,&quot; Landau would have gone on to become one of the greatest villains of the big screen.<br />The cast is only one of the factors that make &quot;NBN&quot; a great movie.  The film offers a perfect blend of comedy and suspense.  The cropduster and Mount Rushmore sequences are awesome.  The photography is perfect.<br />By almost sheer coincidence, three of the stars would go on to appear in several of the great televison spy shows of the 1960s.  As mentioned above, Landau appeared in &quot;Mission: Impossible.&quot;  Leo G. Carrol, who played good guy-spy boss Alexander Waverly on &quot;The Man From UNCLE,&quot; plays a very similar role in this movie.  Edward Platt, who played The Chief on the spy spoof &quot;Get Smart,&quot; briefly appears as Grant's attorney.<br />One of the greatest spy movies of all time.  I have already seen this movie at leastsix times and can stand to see it several times more.  Very well-recommended.
B000001OAA|5.0|Well, I've procrastinated about posting a review for this long enough.  Garbage (self titled) is quite simply one of my favorite albums, period.  Not only do I empathize with the emotions and artistic flavors of it, but also it's one of the most complex pieces of production ever created.  I own a *very* expensive monitoring earphone made by an audiology company.  It's arguably the highest resolution, most transparent audio transducer on the planet.  When I listen to Garbage with these earphones, there's more intricacy and complexity and stuff swirling around than my brain can really keep track of.  What's so amazing, though, is that every little sound lends itself to the music, to the art.  It never ceases to amaze me.  Stupid Girl has these vocal layers that are absolutely astounding in their subtlety.  Every song has unique production quality and textures, as apposed to Version 2.0's Pro Tools sound.  Then of course, we come to Shirley's voice.  There's simply nothing I would change about her vocal inflexions and stylings at all for this CD.  Yes, they are heavily influenced by Curve, but Garbage is uniquely something else.  And as far as I'm concerned, the more bands in this &quot;genre&quot; of music the better.  I can only hope the band doesn't dilute their sound further with too much Pretenders and Beach Boys influence than they already have.  Some flavors just don't compliment each other very well.  By the way, they also make great B-Sides.  This is one band that deserves to have their music mastered by Steve Hall at Future Disc in HDCD.
B00005ATQC|4.0|I went to see this movie with my sister and at the very end she told me that she would be better not seeing it. Well, even I didn't like it right away, and look that i'm a die hard Kubrick fan, but I think now a bit different and I would like to share this thought about it./ There are many plots in this film, like in every Kubrick film, and at first you're supposed to take the fidelity theme of the film but, with sure, there are other sub plots. Take Full Metal Jacket, for instance, wich was about war but had also the Jungian discussion about Colective Unconcious where the character, Joker, has his individual personality smashed by his war persona, &quot;is that you  John Waine or is this ME?&quot;./ Jan Harlan told in a recent interview that to understand Kubrick films you can't watch them apart but as a whole pack./ Well, let's go back to EWS, I think if you take the Jungian discussion in FMJ it will serve here alright. 'Cos the fidelity of the Harford couple is also a confrontation of their social archetypes with their unconcious personal desires./ I won't be long here anymore with this psycological plot but I hope it can give some clue to help other people digging this film out.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I went to this movie expecting to not really like the movie, but in stead it has become one of my fave movies. The story line is a bit confusing, but the music, the dancing and the diolouge make it a wonderful movie.<br />Moulin Rouge is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to see a forbidding romance that sets the whole story,or want to hear songs like Madonna's Like a Virgin, remade in a sort of silly manor, this is a movie you would love.
B00005655J|4.0|just found out about this artist on the internet and decided to buy CD.  First time around it was different but the music grows on you right away.  I love the mixture of spanish and french.  Can't wait to get his newest CD. ...  Glad I purchased it when i did and I will treasure it!
B00000JPHG|5.0|Damn she looked good in this flick!!!! Strutting her stuff around in this movie makes me wanna jump the TV. This is probably the best of the Chucky sequels. The kills are good, the humor is silly, Chucky's one liners are still dry, but we always loved him for that. I won't give away the surprise ending, but you'll howl with laughter as the credits roll up.<br />Oh and one more time..... ...!!!!!! JENNIFER LOOKED GOOD!
B000059WOD|5.0|I knew I liked the Linkin songs when I heard them on the radio.  I did not expect that I would like the CD as much as I do.  As strange as this sounds, I got the cd about a month ago, and have had it on continuous loop the entire time.  My CD player died, so I had to start using my computer to play it now.  Its been on 24/7 for almost a month.  I still don't get tired of the songs, they are utterly unbelievable and their replayability is unlimited IMO.
B00004LN16|4.0|When I first heard this album, I gave it an honest listen. I mean we all know what to expect when we buy an AC DC album. It was slower and bluesier than earlier releases. That's not a bad thing, in fact this album continues in the vein of what one would expect from AC DC. In fact after listening to it a couple of times, you can almost imagine how the album came about.....<br />Ring, ring, ring,<br />Brian : Hello?<br />Angus : Brian? This is Angus, hey Malcolm and I are sitting around the house drinking Foster's and playing our guitars, you wanna come over?<br />Brian : Sure, I'll be right there.<br />Two hours later, the tapes from the living room and brought to the studio for Cliff and Phil to finish. Yeah, it's a pretty laid back album.<br />Now on stage it's a different story. I saw the Stiff Upper Lip Tour in Ft Lauderdale this year, and let me tell you, AC DC hasn't lost a step. All their classics, Angus' antics, Brian's screaming, and the rhythm section's thunderous noise is all there. I hadn't seen AC DC in over ten years, but they still played like they were on the Back In Black tour. They were on stage like a hungry bunch of twenty year olds trying to get signed. If you've never seen AC DC in concert, you're missing one hell of a rush. The only song they played off Stiff Upper Lip was the title track, but that's OK, they have a very long songlist to choose from.<br />I hope these guys go on forever.
0790729601|5.0|I'm i huge fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger  and this is one of his best movies i think. I have like all of his movies and this is a very good one. But Arnold hasn't makeing a reel good movie since Terminator 2 but hey i love his movies and this is a good movie to buy so order it now or when you get a chance too.
B00004XQP4|4.0|This album is different. Not the usual GD, but some different sounds. If you are a Green Day fan you'll want this album, if not it'll be one of those that sits on the side of your CD collection never being listened to or explored. But, there are some good tunes on this CD, not so commercial like &quot;Castaway&quot; and &quot;Chruch on Sunday&quot; but somewhat cheesy. Billie Joe is still playing around with the sounds but he seems to be getting somewhere. So we'll leave him and in the meantime buys this album for those days when we are bored!
0736656669|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book and was fascinated by the content. The author's premise is that there are specific geographic, animal and plant reasons why some countries and contents were able to flourish. Simple things such as whether or not certain continents had animals that could be domesticated. His theories made sense and accounted for why Europe and Asia where able to become so advanced and other continents were not as successful. I have recommended this to a number of friends and they almost all rave about this book and its content.
B00005AQE8|5.0|2pac, alive or dead has caught the eyes and heart of true rap fans out there. I have been listening to Rap for about 2 years now. I never listened to 2pac because none of his songs attracted me. I asked my friend why did people like 2pac so much? He told me that I had to listen to what he says. I listened and noticed that he says the game for real and he is not playing. He know what he saying and his style is unique. Just try rapping with him and u will see how different he is. Truly a thug. He didnt care wut u though bout him. He had a revenge and he dissed anybody. Even the District Attorney(check &quot;Picture me rolling&quot;). In &quot;No more pain&quot; he describes a little about his daily life as a thug and woman around him. Truly the greatest!!!!!!
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a phenomenal book about finding your place in the world. Jonas, the main character, is living in a futuristic society and is unlike anyone else in his community. Many rules have changed since present day and the people of Jonas' community don't own as much control over their lives as we do. One of the major changes is that Elders choose your occupation when you become a &quot;twelve.&quot; Since Jonas is not outstanding in any of his day to day tasks, he finds himself being placed in a job that is very remote from his society, yet is highly honored. This job allows Jonas to view and experience what our world today was like and even before today's world. These &quot;memories&quot; are transformed to Jonas through the Giver. This is the occupation that Jonas will someday fulfill. However the memories come in many different attitudes from sad, mad, hurtful, happy, fun and many other moods. These have a major effect on Jonas' way of thinking of and seeing his society. This makes Jonas very isolated from everyone in his community. As Jonas sets out to change the world he also finds and changes himself!
B00005AXEL|5.0|I was a very big fan of Fleetwood Mac in the '70's; that was my all-time favorite &quot;coming-of-age&quot; band, and &quot;Rumours&quot; in particular was my favorite album--I nearly wore my LP out.  Admittedly, however, I have listened to little of Stevie Nicks' music after that time, although I still enjoy songs from &quot;Rumours&quot; and other FM classics as much now as I did then.  Especially I grew weary of the much-overplayed recent remake of &quot;Landslide&quot; and was rather skeptical when I saw &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot; on a CD listening preview center at a local bookstore.  Still, I was curious to see what Nicks might be up to now, and the album cover looked intriguing, so I put on the headphones and listened.  What a genuinely great surprise!  I listened to a bit of every song and liked them all so much that I had to get that album, and it's been playing in my car ever since.  Now I want to go check out Stevie Nicks' other post-FM albums.<br />What's really wonderful is that, to me, she is as great and soulful and original a singer now as she was in the earlier days, a testimony and an inspiration that one doesn't have to be 20 to be a successful artist, or a successful anything for that matter.  At whatever age she is now, Stevie Nicks is still sexy and beautiful as ever, and yet she doesn't have to, and has never had to, ride on her looks and other cheap tricks to sell her music--she is a woman with true, great talent and she doesn't compromise her gifts.  More importantly, these songs are real, and what a welcome drink of fresh water.  I am hopeful that my own coming-of-age daughter and others her age will appreciate them amidst the awful, inane, soulless, hollow-sex garbage passing off as music nowadays.<br />I am very glad I bought this new CD.  What an amazing, wonderful discovery!
0385473788|5.0|Why does this little diary written by a young girl confined to an attic continue to fascinate the world more than fifty years after its writing? I think I know.<br />The diary of any young girl might have some appeal, if only at the level of the voyeur or gossip in us. The diary of a remarkably intelligent and articulate young girl like Anne Frank is interesting because she paints her reality with vivid hues and subtle shadings that bring us deeply into her experience.<br />The nature of Anne's experience, sadly, is what makes this work so enduring. The diary of this young girl in the hurricane's eye of one of history's most notorious and inhumane political regimes and cultural upheavals is fascinating.<br />We admire Anne for her courage and her Faith in humanity. We grieve the loss of this bright young life. We shed tears at the tragedy this little book lays bare for the world to read --- a Truth hidden from the world while the diary was being written.<br />This little book also reminds us of Anne's suffering and death in a concentration camp. Though Anne was not able to chronicle that time --- or if she did, it did not survive --- we feel we know her there, too.<br />Anne reminds us, finally, to move beyond the tragedy of her life to live fully. That, not despair, is the central theme of this little classic.
0375703861|2.0|When I picked up this book, I had high hopes for it. I love starting a new book and becoming absorbed in the world of it's characters. Finally at page 266, the only excitement I feel is that soon I'll be through with this incredibly boring novel.  I feel nothing for any of the main characters. I think this book would have been far more interesting if Samad was the one sent away. Less ranting and raving from Samad and more room for all the other potentially great characters in this book.
B000001ESN|5.0|PERMANENT WAVES picks up where HEMISPHERES leaves off. The songs ENTRE NOUS, DIFFERENT STRINGS, and NATURAL SCIENCE could have just as easily occupied a second disc on HEMISPHERES.<br />PERMANENT WAVES also preludes to the future of RUSH where MOVING PICTURES would take us. The songs THE SPIRIT OF RADIO, FREEWILL, and JACOB'S LADDER were the beginning of MOVING PICTURES. Actually, FREEWILL could have also been a track from A FAREWELL TO KINGS. Sort of a move forward, move backward, move forward motion. A VERY LIQUID RECORDING ALL IN ALL.<br />PERMANENT WAVES was my first real introduction to RUSH. Oh, I had friends who had A FAREWELL TO KINGS, and I had heard bits and pieces of FLY BY NIGHT and 2112, but PERMANENT WAVES catapulted my interest in RUSH to the upper hemispheres.<br />I have since added FLY BY NIGHT, CARESS OF STEEL, A FAREWELL TO KINGS, HEMISPHERES, and MOVING PICTURES to my CD collection, but PERMANENT WAVES was the first remastered CD I went after.<br />Nothing much else needs to be said, this is RUSH in their best years.
B00000JGOH|5.0|How do you describe what happens when you watch a film that is so magnificent that at the end you just sit and stare at the blackened screen in awe? It does not happen often. Shakespeare In Love captures the atmosphere of medieval England and at the same time tells a wonderful story. If you have a passion for Shakespeare the poet as I do, I guarantee you will love this film.
B000000WA4|5.0|When I say an album is good, that is not necessarily a compliment. When I say an album is exquisite, however, I mean it. And this album is most certainly exquisite! From the gorgeous &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; to the agnst filled &quot;X.Y.U.&quot; to the lovely &quot;In the Arms of Sleep&quot; to the poppy &quot;1979&quot; to the sleepy lullaby &quot;Farewell and Goodnight&quot; this album is a must-have! It's filled with songs to make you cry, songs that make you want to climb your walls, and songs that are so beautiful you want to hug whoever wrote them. Billy Corgan once again triumphs with this incredible double album.
0790738139|5.0|Terrific movie from start to finish. Guy Pearce got third billing but his was the most complex and difficult role, and he did a superb job. I hope he keeps in mind that his American fans know him as the straight arrow, Lt.Ed Exley -- or, Major Biggs, in &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;. We all know that actors like to 'stretch' but to keep a loyal fan base, he must bring back, from time to time, the man we can admire and respect.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Ronald Maxwell's &quot;Gettysburg&quot; is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Based on Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, this film carefully and enthrallingly details the major events of July 1, 2 and 3, 1863.  This battle, which proved to be the pivotal engagement of the American Civil War and, arguably, all of American history, is depicted, in surprisingly human terms, through the eyes of three men:  General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen), legendary commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, who faces what could be the final victory or defeat of his army.  James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), Lee's second in command, who finds himself torn between loyalty to his commander, and grave misgivings about Lee's strategy.  And Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels), the newly promoted Union Colonel who suddenly find his small band of battle weary troops placed in the key position of Union defense, a position that must be held at all costs.  The battle sequences are played out in appropriately grand and authentically raw fashion, with stirring music and moments of surprising poignancy, such as the beautiful and heroic spectacle of the doomed Pickett's charge.  What is perhaps most surprising though, is how compelling the non-battle scenes are.  It is quite a task to maintain audience interest for a span of more than four hours, but this picture succeeds admirably through fine introspective writing, moments of unexpected humor, and remarkable performances.  The ordinarily mediocre Jeff Daniels, for instance, turns in what may be his best screen performance and Tom Berenger is also at the top of his game.  Sam Elliot's Buford is magnificent and even C. Thomas Howell does good work.  This is a film that portrays not only history, but philosophy as well, and succeeds in showing the horror as well as the glory of this complicated war.  It is a truly remarkable film.  My only complaint is that, in compiling this DVD, the decision was madeto use the theatrical cut of the film.  An excellent director's cut, with something like an extra 17 minutes of footage, has long been available on Laserdisc and should have been the cut used.  This decision is the only thing to prevent this, extra-laden, DVD from being the definitive edition of Gettysburg.
B00004SCX6|2.0|It is one of those cd's where after I got it, I listened to it the whole way through almost 4 times and it has sat on my shelf ever since..not a real durable album.  The songs aren't good enough to want to listen to over and over and over.  This is how I rate them:<br />1. Oops I Did It Again: Very full of pop sound, distinct drum beats, Britney's weak voice, and of course, her favorite word, baby. *<br />2. Stronger: A powerfull girl anthem that would be better with revised wording in some parts and if someone with a better voice was singing it.  Major upside, she doesn't say baby! **<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door: Also has a good message for girls, I would like it better if it was without the valley girl language in some parts (like, so totally!) Again with Brit's weak voice.... *<br />4. Satisfaction: The origional is so much better!  Brit sounds a little [depraved]in parts... *<br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know: Britney belts out the notes in this song's chorus, which is kinda sad because you know that she is really trying but it is still pretty weak.....she just doesn't really have any volume, like Mandy Moore doesn't have any volume either, I like Mandy Moore better though.  Brit tries to be \\"baby girl [racy]\\" in this one. *(Brit is trying)<br />6. What U See: Brit is trying to be a rebellious rock girl in this one, but it doesn't work...she is the \\"Pop Princess\\".  It has a good message though.. **<br />7. Lucky: I like the phone message thing in the front and I also like how the music starts right after the guy finishes talking.  Very pop-ish song.  It sends a good message to girls who think movie stars are perfect..however, Britney said that she does not feel this way about the business, but if she doesn't then why does she play Lucky in the music video? ***<br />8. One Kiss From You: Very weak song..soo mushy..oh it hurts me to listen..the pain..the pain. (no stars)<br />9. Where Are You Now: This has the sort of the same message as Destiny'sChild's song \\"Where'd You Go\\" (Where'd You Go is much much better..) However, if you ever had to break up with someone because of moving away, then you will  like it. *<br />10. Can't Make You Love Me: So pop...makes me sick..about a crush.... *<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It: Another syrupy pop song.. (no stars)<br />12. Dear Diary: Co-written by Britney.. Is she trying to make me throw up?? *
B000002UDW|5.0|Just lay back and listen. Brian Wilson never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight section on &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;)on this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling  both excited and uncertain. Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder&quot;), the title cut, and the tear inducing &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since 1966. The more you listen to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the more it's beauty envelopes you.
B000002KHH|2.0|The link you just clicked on is the Bargin bin [stuff]version of the Great *coughunderstatementcough* Black Sabbath album, Paranoid. This is one of those \\"hurry we just realized that CD is going mainstream so release all the cataloge albums\\" releases from the late 80's. It's rushed, using engineers that don't even know what they are doing, probably just new to the job, and have never heard what the original album sounds like, using eighties mastering technology. *shudders* That's a recipie for a rip off, folks. And what's ironic is that in the sleeve Warner Brothers claims that Compact Discs offers the best sound reproduction, and on the back of the case it says they've tried thier best to represent the original sound as a close as possible. Really? I never knew the original LP's sound so cold and weak! <br />So in the end, only get this if you deperately need this album, but need to pinch pennies. Hey, that's the purpose these releases are serving now in the 21 century.
B0000028PL|5.0|The addition of legendary bassist Doug Wimbish was an inspired move! The brothers in Living Colour have never sounded angrier and more focused than they do on this, thier final studio album. The opening \\"Go Away\\" roars and sounds like a battalion of tanks coming to flatten everything in it's path. Corey Glover unleashes a parched, barking, gruff and soulful delivery on this track that may frighten you upon first listening and the lyrics are classic (\\"I don't want anybody to touch me, I think that everybody has AIDS, What's the point in praying for you, You're gonna die anywayhay!\\"), frightening? You better believe it! and that's whole point. Upon it's release in 1993, guitarist and band founder Vernon Reid described the album as \\"music for misfits\\" and he couldn't be more right. As violent as most of \\"Stain\\" sounds, the LP also has moments of sheer beauty the most notable example being the guitarless ballad \\"Nothingness\\". Recorded outside at night (listen close and you'll hear the crickets chirping in the background) with lead vocalist Glover singing into a satellite dish for a stunning double tracked effect, \\"Nothingness\\" is a moment of absolute perfection, it simply can't be touched. My personal faves are the walloping \\"Leave It Alone\\" (don't you just love the coda with Vernon soloing over the top of Doug's funky, popping bass and William Calhoun's fat bottomed drumming?), the punk attack of \\"This Little Pig\\" (the reference to the Rodney King beating that opens the track will drive the point home) featuring one of the albums most inspired solos( Vernon simply riffing hard, heavy and relentless on the same three chords for nearly a minute) it WILL have you banging your head. The art-rock pretensions of \\"WTFF\\", \\"Hemp\\" and the trippy, multi-layered, psychedelic closer \\"Wall\\" which bangs you over the head with it's message of Acceptance and Non-Predjudice. Special Musical Note: Drummer William Calhoun is in especially fine form on \\"Auslander\\", his snare and foot work on the choruses is ferocious! I really hated to see them go, but the the best black rock band on the planet went out with a bang! Living Colour, you are sorely missed.on the choruses is ferocious! I really hated to see them go, but the the best black rock band on the planet went out with a bang! Living Colour, you are sorely missed.
0812550706|5.0|The story is simple: Earth has been attacked twice by an alien race (known as &quot;Buggers&quot; for their insect-like appearance). A floating Battle School has been erected in space to train the brightest children on earth for the eventual final conflict everyone knows is coming. It's not a question of if, but when, and the leaders of the world want to be ready.<br />The most promising student to ever come along is a young boy by the name of Andrew Wiggin, nicknamed Ender. He is a naturally brilliant tactician and he has one trait that Earth desperately needs, he knows how to win. He knows how to win not just current situations, but how to win permanently. As the book progresses it becomes clear that Earth's only hope of survival rests with this child. It's kill or be killed, and the people of Earth want to live.<br />The ending will shock you the first time. It will shock you even on subsequent readings. You will find yourself thinking and pondering the book for weeks. After finishing it for the first of many times the only word this reviewer could think of to describe the book was &quot;wow&quot;. Even now, after reading and re-reading the book, I feel the same response. Wow. Wow. Wow.<br />Ender's Game is one of those books that will grab you and keep you in its choke-hold until you finish the book and finally come up for air. Every writer wishes they could write a book half as good as this one. This is the book that made Orson Scott Card, and it remains his best work.<br />Ender's game is part of a series of books called The Ender Quartet (there are four of them). The Ender Quartet is made up of two sections, Ender's Game and the other three books. Ender's Game is self-contained and does not need the other three. Speaker For the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind have their own plot arc that is wholly separate from Ender's Game. They are excellent in their own way, but they are not needed to fully appreciate Ender's Game.<br />In conclusion, if there isone Orson Scott Card book you will ever read, make it Ender's Game.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This film is so close to real life it's almost scary. The rush of emotions one feels when watching Lester Burnham (played to absolute perfection by Kevin Spacey) wander through his life like a suburban zombie is simply devastating. The film was directed by Sam Mendes is such a serene, crystal-clear and precise manner, I can't help but be reminded of the late, great Stanley Kubrick who had a way of making even the most disturbing ideas seem appealing with his use of slow rhythms, dramatic pauses and glaring white light. Annette Bening's Caroline is the perfect shrew, but that tough exterior merely masks her insecurities (witness her brilliant emotional breakdown alone in the den of horrible house she fails to sale. Slapping herself and screaming &quot;shut up you baby&quot; before slipping back into her role as the domineering control freak is fascinating!) The lucious Thora Birch also turns what could have been a one-note character (Janie) into a tour-de-force of of teen angst and isolation. When she finally succumbs to the charms of the quiet,curious and supremely secure boy next door Ricky Fitts (the superb and commanding Wes Bently) the kiss they share is the most tender and affectionate moment in the entire film. Ricky's speech about all the beauty in the world and the way it fills you up is also a classic. This film fills me up and satisfies on so many levels it's difficult to convey in a mere thousand words. I can only say that if you've ever found yourself in a rut, or felt emotionally paralyzed, &quot;American Beauty&quot; will hit close to home. This was a justified winner of the Oscar for best picture. This movie is simply about being human and saving yourself before it's too late.
0385501560|5.0|Great novel.  Right up there with &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and &quot;The Fountainhead.&quot;
B00003CX95|5.0|The Oscar winner for Best Picture 1995, Braveheart is a masterpiece.  Mel Gibson's epic tale of Scottish Patriot William Wallace certainly qualifies as one of the top 5 movies of the 90's, and one of the greatest movies ever made.<br />I can't say enough about the battle scenes, which certainly set the standard for movies to come.  Films such as Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor and others owe a debt of gratitude to Braveheart for setting the standard in terms of realism and accuracy.  Gibson did an amazing job depicting the brutality and violence of medieval war-making.  Those were the days when surgical strikes and friendly fire were not a part of the vocabulary.  <br />As for acting, well, you can't get much better than Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau and Patrick Mcgoohan (just to name a few).  Patrick was robbed by the Academy when they failed to nominate him for an Oscar in his portrayal of King Edward I.  I have to say that Mel has an incredible talent for film making and casting is no exception.  Every actor played their part to perfection.<br />The cinematography was impeccable.  This movie was one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  The DVD contains a &quot;making of&quot; in which we learn that it rained most of the time and Gibson decided to use that to his advantage rather than work around it.  I have to comend him for this, as it added character to the film and only made the cinematography look that much better.  <br />Finally the music was fabulous.  Horner did a wonderful job painting emotion with a soundtrack second to none.  It's no wonder he was chosen to create the soundtrack for another Oscar winning movie called Titanic.  <br />If you are a DVD collector, you must have this movie.  NO collection is complete without it.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is a very good album for any fan of punk or pop. Why is everyone screaming &quot;sell-out&quot; &quot;sell-out&quot;... What, do you dislike them finally getting NOTICED? Is that why you can't like a great album like EOTS? If you're not too stuck-up, a great CD.
B0000549B0|3.0|Please stop colorizing the classics.  It totally ruins a masterpiece.  I'm surprised the black and white part of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" wasn't colorized as well.  I love \\"Harvey.\\"  It's a fantastic movie.  Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor of all time.  I just wish they'd left it alone.  Colorizing a movie doesn't make it better.  In fact, it cheapens it, if it was originally in black and white.  I came on this site looking for \\"Harvey\\", but when I saw that it was in color, I passed on it.  I'll wait and see if they decide to rerelease it in it's original classic splendor.
B000059HAI|5.0|The Documentary and Commentary by the Director and Japanese Film Historian is great.  That's the great thing about viewing on DVD, you get all this extra information and this gives you a good half a day of entertainment Besides just watching the Movie!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Listened to the music, and was moved to strum along, something rarely done over the years.  Essentially simple music, chordally basic with elegant modulations. Surprising, as one is deftly moved through easily percieved changes, and goes with hand held gratefully.  No rush, no shocks, nothing 'nouveau', recalling the poet Larkin wishing for music that would charm, sooth, bring the gifts of pleasure.  Attenuations of early 'David Crosby' in his solo efforts, and 'The Blue Nile'. Long melodic lines, pausing upon passing notes usually with added harmony, thence onward again, a hint of the lachrymose yet sans sentiment or self-indulgence. Lovely 3-4 minute vignettes, self contained within the usually strangulating song format-where had that gone over all these years?  This man and his music has heart, engineering that keeps the closeness and lack of bobast intimate, like and old friend.  Friendly music perhaps?  Could well be sung and played amongst a few guitars, a tin drum or spoons, an out of tune piano, and conviviality.  Do any of us recall that?-conviviality....  If laid aside in some distant past, listen to this....it was in our back pocket.
B00004RHZU|4.0|Can't Take Me Home is a great first cd. Pink is a good singer w/ some major talent. This girl tells you how guys sometimes are w/o being mean she is just saying that she doesn't want to be played by her bf and that if he comes crying back to her oh well his loss. I only give it 4 stars b/c after a little while it gets old and boring. But I still would really think that this cd is a must have for anyone.
B00003CY5K|4.0|It's a cute film, with great hair and costumes. It doesn't try to do too much, but is comfortable with its improbable script and characters from central casting. All around, a fun hour and a half with a bubble-gum soundtrack to match.
B000006OS2|1.0|For all of you who got a DVD player for the digital quality, you will not find it here. Avoid the Goodtimes release and spend the extra $5-10 for the &quot;Authorized by the Wayne Estate&quot; version and you will not be sorry. The picture quality of the Goodtimes is not only poor and grainy, there are certain spots in the movie where a zoom effect takes place. I have seen this movie dozens of times on tape and if I had a choice between VHS and Goodtimes DVD, I would watch the tape. My family and I all love this movie but the Goodtimes version definitely was returned for refund at the store where purchased.
B000002UAU|5.0|If Sgt.Peppers did not exist Rock 'n roll would probably not be considered an actual art today. The Beatles had basically disappeared off the earth during the time it was recorded. Locking themselves in the studio spending long hours recording this work of art . Fans and critics thought they were gone when out of nowhere the record came out. The album was a monster, knocking the Monkees excellent HEADQUARTERS album out of the Billboard no.1 spot and holding it for the whole summer!<br />Although it was considered a big rock album, Sgt. Peppers is also a  interesting blend of classical and pop music. The songs certainly do not suffer from it interesting flavour. The title track SGT.PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is a great rocker followed by the classic WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS. Next is the physcadelic LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS followed by another rocker GETTING BETTER. FIXING A HOLE is a cool track and SHE'S LEAVING HOME is very pretty. The album's bizarre flavour with BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE! Then it takes a step into physcadelia with WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU. After that is McCartney musical hall-like WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR. More fun follows with LOVELY RITA and GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. The record finishes up with a quick SGT. PEPPERS REPRISE followed by the grand finale of A DAY IN THE LIFE.<br />In my opinion SGT. PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is one of the most important pieces of Rock 'n roll history. If you don't have it , take my advice... get it! It's very interesting and it was definetly another turning point for the Beatles. If you have only heard early Beatles this takes some getting used to please be open minded when you listen to this because it is awesome! Highly recommended!
B00003CXAR|5.0|&quot;We're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot; These were the words said by Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) to Quint (Robert Shaw) just after brody came face to face with the great white shark that had been terrorizing Amity Island for weeks. It is at this point in the film that we really, for the first time, see the shark, who is actually the star of the film. Roy Sheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw offer outstanding performances in this Steven Spielberg classic that has stood the test of time for over twenty-five years.<br />The DVD is loaded with features that make this worth buying such as a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, a photo gallery, outtakes, trailers and more. And on top of all that, the video transfer is excellent! It offers a nice crystal clear presentation of the film in its widescreen (2.35:1) aspect ratio. And the sound will blow you away!! The quality of this DVD is just incredible, especially considering the film's age! Bottom line- Just buy it, you will love it! It's as simple as that!
B000002UDB|5.0|All right I will admit that I greatly underestimated MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in my previous review of it.  So I decided to write a better review on this awesome record! To me it turns out to be one the finest albums of 1967!  Each song is interesting in it's own way and that's what makes this album really cool!<br />This was originally concieved as a soundtrack to the tv special but became known as an album when additional songs were added to the record to make it a 33 1/3 record instead of the out of demand 78&quot;.  To me this album is like a sequel to SGT.PEPPERS LHCB and like most sequels it tends to be a little weaker than the original but it is still excellent!  <br />The album starts off with MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR an awesome song followed by the peaceful THE FOOL ON THE HILL and they a far out instrumental FLYING. Next is the erie Harrison tune BLUE JAY WAY followed by the McCartney-style YOUR MOTHER SHOULD KNOW.  Next is I AM THE WALRUS one of the Beatles finest tracks followed by the groovy HELLO GOODBYE.  Next is the single STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER/ PENNY LANE both being hit Beatles songs.  Next is the neat BABY YOU'RE A RICH MAN and finally closes with ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE which delivers a great message.<br />Despite the rather lop-sidedness of the album it is still excellent and that mere lop-sidedness does not really effect this great music.  Beatles fans should get this if they can because it is really far out in an awesome way!  The tv special may not have been a huge hit but this album certainly was!  Highly recommended!
006016848X|1.0|The only thing worth getting out of this book is this:  Men talk to impart information.  Women talk to express feelings.<br />If you got that, that's it.  The rest of the book is puerile psychobabble.
B0000028UK|4.0|Pearl Jam's 'VS', their second album, is a pretty good successor to 'Ten'.  However, it's neither as good as 'Ten' nor as artistic as 'Vitalogy'.<br />It's still a four star album though.
0380973650|3.0|I have never read any  of the &quot;graphic books&quot; by Neil Gaiman, so I cannot venture forth an opinion comparing them to his novels. I started reading his books with &quot;Neverwhere&quot; which I loved, then &quot;Stardust&quot; which I very much liked, and now this book, &quot;American Gods&quot;. I have not completely formed an opinion on this book; it was OK, and it was sorta wierd. I have read lots of WIERD books - from the kind of strange you get from Stephen King to the wierd you get from the discount book store, (which sell books that the publisher gives them for pennies because they didn't sell well)... anyway, in my mind, the jury is still out on this one.
B00002NDB1|3.0|Virtual XI, the second Iron Maiden album featuring Blaze Bayley at vocals. Let me start off by saying that this album is not nearly as bad as people claim it to be. The reason that people say this album sucks and is Maiden's worse ever album is because it's not so easy to replace one of the greatest & most powerful voices in rock history in Bruce Dickinson. Blaze does a decent job filling in for Dickinson, plus the absence of Adrian Smith isn't helping much either. Also, Maiden fans are so accustomed to great albums. <br />I bought this album when it was originally released and actually enjoyed it quite a bit! It features some great riffs, including possibly one of their finest singles ever in \\"Futureal\\"! \\"Lightning Strikes Twice\\" is also a great riff and loved it the first time i heard it! \\"The Clansman\\" & \\"The Angel & The Gambler\\" are also very solid songs!<br />I think open-minded Maiden fans should enjoy this album and will hopefully appreciate it, since it's not so bad. Up The Irons!!
B0000062FL|5.0|Song for song the first album (Lion) is Santana's best. It's rare when quality beats quantity on record. After seeing them perform &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; in the Woodstock movie, there was no way it could be topped. Then they came out with this masterpiece, mixing mellow sounds with the explosive power. The first four songs on &quot;Abraxas&quot; are as good as any one side of an album ever put down. These songs are heard best in this form, not in chopped up singles like on radio and greatest hits packages. The latter part of the cd has the classic anthem &quot;Samba Pa Ti&quot;, an instrumental that will go down as one of the best in history. Santana is a genius because he makes great music that sells and never got caught in commercialism. He carried on brilliantly after &quot;Abraxas&quot; with a wonderful career, but this is the cadillac- the greatest Latin Rock album of alltime.
0790733226|5.0|I saw the movie twice at the theatres, then later on Video and finally I bought the DVD. I did read the book first and eventough there are some differences the subject of how would be a first encounter with aliens is treated in the best possible way. <br />No fantasies or alegories but just a very interesting scientific point of view. Plus remarkable on this movie is the possible reaction that such an event would generate for the great public and the government. All the craziness and insanity reactions are just perfect captured in this movie. <br />Jodie Foster is a great actress and gives a touching and very sincere representation for Ellie, the main caracter in the story.<br />The extras on the DVD were not that great, I think they could have showed more about Carl Sagan and his legacy.<br />Overall, Contact is a great movie and makes you reflect about all the insane things we see on the media about aliens... I also recommend not only this movie, but the book itself as well as all the other books from Carl Sagan, in particular The Demon-Haunted World.
0800177177|4.0|This is a fascinating movie, but not just for the reasons Coppola might have intended. It's a lushly shot, beautifully staged affair, oozing over-ripe, autumnal colours in obvious counterpoint to cool blues and bloodless hues asociated the cast of vampires.  It is outwardly a fairly faithful rendering of Bram Stoker's novel, but in pretty much every other respect it puts a novel spin on the well worn story.<br />For one thing, it's not very scary; any horror is supplanted by the decadence and sexuality of the film.  Coppola doesn't seem to care less about frightening the viewers; he seems much more interested devloping themes: for example, people and things spend A LOT of the film falling, and climbing back up again (I suppose this is sin and redemption) and there is a real feel of decadence and over-ripeness throughout. But it's never any more focussed than that - It's not clear exactly what he's getting at, other than just inverting the conventional wisdom.<br />The treatment of the good count is unusual; there's more than a sense that he's the victim in all of this - he's pegged out as having lost true love in tragic cirucmstances which, by operation of dastardly Christian law, inevitably pitted him against God and, by implication, the Great &amp; Good.<br />But the film isn't consistent about this - on one hand Dracule is painted as a noble warrior defeating the (decadent) hoardes and re-taking Constantinople and cruelly being deprived of his one love, but then later, according to Van Helsing, he's Vlad the Impaler, who ritually murdered defenceless prisoners and drank their blood.<br />In any case the vamps definitely have the most fun: Gary Oldman has a whale of a time in the various iterations of the Dracula character (his Transylvanian accent is priceless) and Sadie Frost is sex on a stick as the doomed Lucy. Good guy Keanu Reeves, on the other hand, is as dreadful as you would expect - the man can't act, and his English accent, when he manages to hold it together, is surely one of the worst to ever have graced celluloid.<br />I don't think Coppola succeeds in making any grand statements, though he certainly tries. But the film works at pure entertainment level, so it doesn't really matter.together, is surely one of the worst to ever have graced celluloid.<br />I don't think Coppola succeeds in making any grand statements, though he certainly tries.

B00003CXC7|5.0|If you want a stylish thriller, this is the perfect choice! Extremely well made. You are sitting on the edge of your seat most of the time. I also recommend &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, both made by Hitchcock.
B000002WU9|5.0|THe best Wu solo album is this.No album can be compared like this.The best tracks are Rainy Days,Verbal Intercource,Heaven or Hell and Ice Water
0767817486|5.0|This is one of the most important movies ever made, in my opinion. There seem to be a few people who don't like this movie and/or think it's silly. You have to think of something: you don't know how much Hayes might have suffered. I can understand that the Turks don't like this movie, but I myself think it's a masterpiece.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie is by far the best I've ever seen! Even though it's still in theaters, I paid the full $7.25 to see it 3 times. It's a brilliant film with music, dancing and best of all...love. Christian (Ewan McGregor), a poet-writer from London comes to Paris in search of a new writing job. His neighbors bring him to the Moulin Rouge to share a script (Spectacular Spectacular) with the &quot;pimp&quot; of the Moulin Rouge, Harry Zidler. Christian gets the job and soon finds him self head over heels for Satine (Nicole Kidman), the sparkling diamond. She is the star of the Moulin Rouge. This movie has an amazing array of songs including remakes of &quot;Diamonds are a girls best friend,&quot; sung by Nicole kidman and &quot;Your song,&quot; sung by Ewan McGregor. The two lovers &quot;theme song&quot; is &quot;Come what may,&quot; which is sung by both of them. This movie will get you laughing, dancing, singing, and even crying. It's a beautiful love story and I'm sure anyone will enjoy it.
0792838068|5.0|Hollywood cannot portray recovery from what ails Nicholas Cage in this film, for recovery is not a matter of images.  The 1948 film The Lost Weekend was marred by the need for a happy ending, which is the imaging of redemption.<br />We may contrast this film with 28 Days, a movie about &quot;recovery&quot; starring Sandra Bullock.  Leaving Las Vegas, and 28 Days, have the same male-female polarity as A Civil Action (a 1997 film, starring John Travolta, about a failed environmental lawsuit) and Erin Brockovich; for Erin Brockovich, in order to provide a believable happy ending in a society in which the most recent Presidential election had to be decided by a quiet coup d'etat, had to individualize struggle, and make it into a game show.  A Civil Action portrayed the truth of the plaintiff's bar as modal total loss, with occasional wins reversed on appeal making the news.<br />This is a male-female polarity because both 28 Days and Erin Brockovich use a triumphalist-feminist narrative which images and personalizes evil in the form of men, and unrealistically portray women as able, courtesy of misunderstood, vernacular feminism, to get to the required happy ending.  Their &quot;win&quot;, however, is a zero-sum game.  Brockovich claws her way to the top of a bogus revolution by dissing African-Americans and fat people (the latter in a snide plug for a Southern maker of near-inedible donuts that was probably connected with an IPO for Krispy Kreme that happened shortly after the film's release.)  In the irredemiably lower-middle-class economy of 28 Days, Sandra's Aussie boyfriend has to personalize clueless evil.<br />Leaving Las Vegas portrays in a mature way the consequences on relationships of the commodity system: for in the pressure of commodities as represented by Las Vegas causes relationships to use sado-masochistic mechanisms.<br />In the Las Vegas portrayed, &quot;winning&quot; has become a floating signifier which is detached from any sense of desert (as in deserving to win, by making a contribution to a society which has disappeared from the ontology of the individual.)  As a screenwriter, Cage portrays the plight of the real contributor to other people's success whose own success or failure is too unimportant from the standpoint of capital NOT to become a detached screen &quot;credit&quot; with no relation to reality.<br />Cage decides to drink himself to death and Liz Shue invites herself along for the ride.  No possible &quot;happy ending&quot; could be imaged for this plot because the ending would take outside of the system in which Cage is enmeshed.
0783227272|5.0|This film is not for those who are decidedly jaded. Best seen by 'children' whose passion for ideals are still alive and burning. Definitely not for those uncomfortable with emotions or those with issues with the past.
B00003CXV4|4.0|It's hard to imagine the premise of this film happening in real life...a young woman devotes an entire month of her life to helping the lives of complete strangers. Or, to put it mildly, she takes a new lover every month. Nelson (Keanu Reeves) is, at the start of the film, obsessed with one thing...himself. He's selfish, arrogant, and a workaholic. Sara (Charlize Theron) is a free spirit who decides that Nelson needs her \\"help.\\" Over the course of the month, we see Nelson transformed into a lovesick sweetie (he even sings for Sara, and I was blown away...Keanu Reeves can sing, and sing well!) The month ends, but Nelson doesn't want the relationship to. He tries his hardest to win Sara over and make her forget about her \\"one month only\\" rule, but Sara has a secret that forces her to stick to her rule, and it's this secret that is the most devastating to Nelson. Keanu & Charlize are good together, and the film has some tender moments, but the end was a letdown for me. As far as Keanu's role goes, he seemed more comfortable in the role of laid-back nice guy instead of the arrogant person that he started out as. Of course, I will never have anything bad to say about him, as I worship the ground he walks on. Charlize gives a fine performance, as well. Frank Langella has a juicy bit part as a man who is so nasty and cold, it gave me chills, and he must have given Nelson the chills, too, because we see in his eyes a slight change as he sees in Langella what he doesn't want to become. Also, look for the lovely Lauren Graham (TV's \\"Gilmore Girls) as Nelson's girlfriend, Angelica. All in all, a very sweet, touching, and sad film with wonderful performances.
B00005B36H|5.0|Every so often, a truly monumental album is released.  One which has the potential to re-shape our &quot;pop-culture&quot; minds, and change the way we hear music forever.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; is just such an album.  Tool's approach to song writing is extremely refreshing, as well as much needed in this age of porno-rap-thrash-sync-whatever.  While I can appreciate the fact that boundaries between musical genres are coming down, I find it very pathetic that every slightly new combination, of already existing styles, is considered to be revolutionary or ground-breaking.  Fortunately, Tool has managed to continue sounding like &quot;Tool&quot;, while simultaneously reinventing themselves as a creative force.  Lateralus is at once; heavier, more musically complex, and more melodic than all of their previous releases, no less anything anyone else has done in a very long time.  The album consists of one brilliant track after another, all fitting beautifully, and magically, into a very cohesive and theme-like vibe, which is apparent throughout.  Every track is an intense journey with a life of it's own.  Like any truly gifted work, each song gets better with every listen, as more and more intricate details reveal themselves.  Rarely is such intense, heartfelt emotion coupled so successfully with such technical, musical brilliance.  This album deserves far more than a 5 star rating, but this will have to do for now.  I can only hope that Tool continues it's career by using this milestone as a reference point for everything that is right about song writing, and music in general.  Be it theirs, or anyone else's.

Significant Other was way better , the only alright tracks in my opinion are Boiler , It'll Be Ok , Hold On , and this other one......meh , Rollin was catchy....the first 3 times I heard it .
0446364495|3.0|I found this book to be both as good and as bad as its reputation.  I suppose that it is just a romance novel (I wouldn't know), but the protagonists and the setting are so wonderfully drawn as to make it more than worthwhile.  Waller brings real empathy to the loneliness with which they lead their lives, and when they find each other he makes their desperate love real.<br />What he doesn't bring, unfortunately, is a consistent feel for the English language.  His prose is often quite amateurish, and many of his best scenes are sabotaged by truly awful sentences.  I'm not surprised that the movie was so much better, since it *is* a great story, and movie directors get to call rewrite when confronted with ridiculous dialogue.  Too bad the publisher didn't do that.
B000001FI7|5.0|I only recently gave Portishead a chance and I glad I did.  Beth's voice perfectly compliments the rainy day music so well I couldn't believe it.  This album is perfect for anyone who just wants something to relax to.  Beth's voice will sooth you and depress you at the same time.  <br />Each track progresses very well and doesn't leave any little bit of filler on the album.  Wandering Stars, Sour Times, hell every song is great.  It doesn't matter what genre of music you like, anybody will like Portishead.
B00004SVID|5.0|The Wall was the first ever Pink Floyd album that I bought. Wish You Were Here followed, and finally, Dark Side Of The Moon came into view. The Wall LIVE is only the fourth (or 3rd and a half) Floyd album I've bought in a span of 1 year. <br />    It's not that notably different from the studio version, mainly because the crowd has been watered (no pun intended) out in damn near all of the tracks, or that's just the way it is. I feel, if it's going to be live, it ought to feel live, instead of cheering between songs. <br />    Anyhoo, this is a great album whichever way you choose to view it. The keyboard work is more satisfying than on the studio version, and David Gilmour really shows that he can play the f'ing guitar on extended versions of Another Brick In The Wall pt. 2, Comfortably Numb, Hey You, etc. The drumming is a little more focused as well, especially on What Shall We Do Now. <br />    I'll say this-if you want Roger Waters' first real solo project, stick to what went on in the studio. But if you really want Pink Floyd at their collective best, buy this. It is definitely more of a Pink Floyd album than the studio version, and you'll notice when you get it.
B000002GJS|5.0|Veteran Canadian rocker's sixth album in 1991 is the second most successful album for Bryan that put out four major hits such as CAN'T STOP THIS THING WE STARTED, THOUGHT I'D DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN, DO I HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS, and (EVERYTHING I DO) I DO IT FOR YOU which was previously featured as the main theme track for Kevin Costner's \\"Robin Hood\\". Previous album INTO THE FIRE showed mature and adult rock side of Bryan but this one again tried to recapture the roughhousing rock vibe just like his most successful album RECKLESS in 1984. The most prominent example could be HOUSE ARREST with the lines from which the title of the album came.<br /> Mutt Lange who also did Def Leppard's HYSTERIA was instrumental in adding glam feel to this album, less keyboard, and more guitar parts. IS YOUR MAMA GONNA MISS YA and HOUSE ARREST might have been the answer to glam metal turks popped out since the Guns' APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION. DO I HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS, THOUGHT I'D DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN, and VANISHING in contrast are the refined ballads but with solid beat just as Def's HYSTERIA ballads were. I also love ALL I WANT IS YOU and DEPEND ON ME. On the whole this album is filled with the great solid songs the reason I love Bryan Adams' music.<br /><br />*Re-reviewed in January 28, 2014<br /><br />Verdict: Excellent rock album with great sing-along songs<br />Rating: 95 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Bryan Adams fans and late 80s to early 90s pop rock fans.
B000002H2H|5.0|I bought this album during the middle of the whole Metallica vs. the Internet ordeal. I was on the Internet's side, and I wasn't kicked off or anyhting, but my computer's sound card got [goofed] up, and I couldn't hear the songs I got anymore anyway. So, me being me, I decided to give Metallica a go, and bought this album out of random.<br /> I got it, put it in the CD player, and sat back (a musical tradition with my family-always listen to an album all the way through, only skipping if it is a bad song...it's my tradition, at least). I heard the few opening seconds and noticed that it wasn't thashing out of my speakers...wait...BOOM. I found myself air-drumming with the song, and realized that I had been brought into this monster called Metallica...and enjoyed it. The title track took me to my uncle's position, and For Whom The Bell Tolls is a ... great tune, spaced-out solo at the end. Fade To Black was a sudden mood change compared to it's predecessors on the album, ... great tune either way you look at it, my personal favorite off of the album. The next 2 songs were great, and the album's closing 2 are some of the best 14+ minutes in rock that I can think of. <br /> All in all, the album changed my mind about Metallica, and it can you too, unless you buy one of the LOADs first, then it's too late. So, if you think you can handle Metallica (and everything that comes with it), buy this album as a starter kit, and see what you think.
0062502182|5.0|This book was assigned reading in an english class i took, and at first i thought it would suck. After all, who wants to read a story about some kid from Andalusia who follows his dream to egypt? Once I picked it up and started reading, however, I found that I genuinely enjoyed it. It is one of the better pieces I have read concerning the interrelation of God, luck, omens, coincidence, destiny, and one's part ina ll this. However, readers who do not want to view this book as more than a simple story will miss out on the bigger messages; whether the messages mean anything or not is a personal choice. I recomend this book to any prospective buyers.
B000002AZ8|5.0|I have read a lot of the reviews on this album and am quite dissapointed by people's (Especially people who claim to be Pearl Jam fans) reactions to songs like \\"Bugs\\", \\"Pry, To\\",etc (the so called \\"experimental [stuff]\\") It is veary true say that the obvious stand outs on Vitalogy are Better Man, Corduroy, Spin the Black Circle, Immortallity, Nothingman, and all the other truelly excelent songs, but you must admit that a song like Bugs is a comedy song a deliberate attempt by Pearl Jam to make you laugh, it is part of what makes Pearl Jam good. They are not afraid to go out there and put a song on their album that people might scorn, but they think are funny. I admit listening to Stupid Mop and Bugs and Aye Davanita can get agrevating but skip them most times you listen to the album and then on the few occasions you do listen to them you can't help but laugh. Enough about the comedy, Everything everyone else has said about the great tracks is true so it would be pointless in repeating them. On the whole a great album and remember what makes Pearl Jam the brilliant, diverse band they are. Experiments.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Are you in the mood for a movie with deep, philosophical overtones?  Want to watch a film that is a cerebral challenge, one sure to leave you intellectually exhausted by the end?  If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to either of these questions, then &quot;Gone In 60 Seconds&quot; is most assuredly not for you.  At least, not in your present state of mind.<br />However, if you want a movie that is just plain a lot of fun, one that has a few laughs &amp; is well done, then you will enjoy this one.  In fact, this is an almost sure-fire movie if you're searching for these attributes.<br />This movie is the result of pouring together a flimsy plot, good direction &amp; top echelon actors such as Nicholas Cage, Robert Duvall and Angelina Jolie, stir gently with a quality Trevor Rabin soundtrack, sprinkle in some of the most gorgeous sports cars in the world, then let it sit for 60 seconds.  Afterwards, pop it into your DVD player and it's ready to watch!<br />As is the case with every Bruckenheimer movie except &quot;Armageddon,&quot; this production is very well done.  It is also noteworthy to mention that &quot;Gone In 60 Seconds&quot; is NOT just one big, long chase scene, or a series of chase scenes one-after-the-other.  By my count, there were only two car chase scenes;  a brief one in the beginning &amp; a dramatic one towards the end.  Somehow, the film found ways to keep my attention in between times;  remarkable for a movie that is almost exclusively about stealing cars.<br />The main question that will probably decide whether people enjoy this movie does not have so much to do with the film itself as it does the genre.  Can you appreciate a light-hearted, fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously?  Do you prize the opportunity of seeing exotic cars like Ferrari, Lamborgini, Porsche &amp; a vintage Mustang?  If so, odds are you will enjoy this one.  If not, you likely won't.  It's that simple.
0061020680|5.0|Mort is Definately one of Pratchett's best (which one isn't). I am at the moment involved in the play and am playing Mort. I haven't laughed so much in all my life as when I was reading this book. My favourite part being When Mort (Death's Apprentice) and Ysabell(Death's Daughter- adopted of course) diss each other about their appearances. Death is a really cool character and you will love this book, I don't care who you are.
B00000G3PA|1.0|What a waste.  Those were the words that echoed thru my mind as the movie ended.  What a waste of an outstanding Trevor Rabin soundtrack.  What a waste of the considerable talents of Jerry Bruckenheimer and Michael Bay.  Not to mention an all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi and Liv Tyler.<br />The fatal flaw of this movie is that it can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be.  NASA locates an asteroid the size of Texas heading straight for the Earth, and everyone seems to think it hilarious.  After the laughter settles down, NASA hires a bunch of oil-rig drillers to go up and take out the asteroid.<br />So, what we end up with is a movie full of slapstick comedy, combined with good special effects.  However, every once in awhile a sentimental, tender moment is stuck in.  Can you imagine someone trying to integrate a serious, emotional moment into a movie like \\"Airplane!\\"?  No?  Well, that's what they did with this movie.  The result is nothing less than absurd.  And I won't even ask why NASA deemed it necessary to take gatling gun  into space with them.<br />Don't get me wrong:  I'm all for fun movies.  \\"Con Air\\" and \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" are two of my favorite movies as far as pure entertainment goes.  It's just that there is something about the threat of an asteroid hitting the Earth and making the human race going the way of the dinosaur which seems incompatible with a slapstick comedy.  \\"Deep Impact\\" is a far superior movie;  it has the reflective moments minus the comedy.
B0000028UK|5.0|This Cd is an Awsome attribute to any CD collection. The guitar riff's are brilliant and complement Eddies voice really well. If it is your first time buying a Pearl Jam album this one is a good start. My personal favorite is Elderly Woman Behind The Counter followed closly by Animal, Daughter, Leash, Go, Dissident and Glorified G, my worst and the album's only bad song in my eyes is W.M.A, don't ask me why but it just gets on my nerves. Other Than that a good listen from begining to end. I would actually rate it a 4.5 but can't.
B00003BDXG|3.0|'Natural Born Killers' is meant to be a spin-off of the image of violence that the public has given our society in the past decade or so. The movie is also a detailed bio of the lives of the unfortunate few people out there who end up becoming mass murderers. <br />The public, in general, recognizes our ability to see things on television that may be sexual or violent and laugh at them and not try to generate that material to reality. But, when a child does copy actions from TV, businesses get sued and so on. This movie justify's why violence does take place; from sexually abused children growing up and not from things that we see on television. The 'I Love Mallory' scenes were meant to mock the public's image of violence, vulgarness and sex on television to show where the line is drawn between television entertainment and reality. <br />The content is pretty graphic; the only reason that this wasn't given an NC-17 rating was because it had a lesson behind it; which was that television is responsible for nothing.

The cd is all of their number one hits put onto one cd. Now tell me, what more could you ask for other than a cd of the number one group in the world singing all of their number one hits? They have all the favorites...Yesterday, Let It Be, and my personal favorite...Hey Jude.

B00000ILDE|5.0|They definitely did this DVD right. The extra footage really enchances the story line and gives you a lot of background on Newt, her family, and what happened on LB7. The audio and video transfer are first rate. Even though the audio is not DTS it is one of the best Dolby 5.1 tracks I have heard. The extras are good but not overwhelming. Overall a great DVD and a must for any Sci-Fi fan.
B000002MP2|2.0|I heard &quot;When I Come Around&quot; on the radio and thought it was great. So I bought the album it was on. I should have given the 10 bucks to the Salvation Army. In fact, every time I consider buying a Green Day album, I give the money to charity instead. Seriously. Absolutely every single song on Dookie sounds EXACTLY the same. It took all my willpower to listen all the way through this darwin-awful album before giving it away. &quot;When I Come Around&quot; is an excellent song, but the rest is .... I hate to resort to insults, but it really is that bad. The people who gave it five, four, or even three stars must be stuck in 1994 when it was cool to like Green Day. Track 10 is proof that even the most talentless band can make a good song, but that doesn't make Dookie worth anything more than it's namesake. It would get one star, but track 10 brings it out of the abyss into the two-star level.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I went to see this movie, namely because Clooney was in it, and everyone in Kentucky knows where he came from. The movie was terrible, but the soundtrack really got my attention. <br /> I listened to it, skipping only the alternate versions of &quot;I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;In The Highways&quot;. The album is great, for anyone who doesn't mind a little homegrown music, and for anyone who needs a break from today's pop-culture ...The album includes, of course, Man of Constant Sorrow, but some other greats too, like Big Rock Candy Mountain (perfect in every sense of the word), You Are My Sunshine (again, perfect), In The Jailhouse Now, and nearly everything else (except for the instrumental versions of 'Constant Sorrow').<br /> All in all, this album is what classic bluegrass is all about. Buy it, enjoy it, thank you.
0312119038|5.0|The author is a well-known popular writer on religion (if such a thing exists), but here turns to her own experience in a convent for seven years. At the tender age of 17 Armstrong joined a contemplative order--one not totally cloistered but close enough for the first few years--and attempts to destroy her own ego to allow God to fill her mind and soul. Unfortunately, what happens is what all too often happens in life when one human being is given total authority over another, even with that person's consent--the worst human impulses toward cruelty take over--the desire to inflict on another what has been inflicted on oneself is passed on down the line just as the abused child becomes the abusive parent. In this case the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience translate into senseless restrictions on basic human needs like eating and bathing, ridiculous orders being given in the name of testing obedience, neglect of the health of the young novices, refusal to acknowledge abusive behavior of priests, etc. Despite all this, Armstrong manages to convey the beauty of the religious experience and love of God. I was struck by how similar to eastern religions were the methods used to &quot;seek God&quot;--the denial of bodily needs, the isolation from other human beings, the notion that an individual must let go of the self to find God--all are straight out of Buddhism. Is the concept of the self too highly developed and embedded in the Western man or woman for these methods to work? Does the bodily and mental deprivation do something strange to the self that &quot;creates&quot; the experience of God? Is authentic religious experience only for a select few--because if anyone had a &quot;vocation&quot; as I understood the term back then it was certainly Ms. Armstrong--the intensity of her desire to stay the course was overwhelming. In any event this book is a lot more than a broadside attack on the Catholic church pre-Vatican II. I wish the author had answered a few questions in a post-script--her health problems during these years were certainly real but are unexplained, and she leaves the impression that they were caused by the convent--but I suspect that wasn't totally the case. At the very least she seems to have been lactose intolerant--something the convent didn't cause but unfortunately exacerbated. And it's hard to understand how the order thought it could train her to shut down her mind and question nothing for three years and then send her to Oxford. Readers who can get past feeling angry at the treatment Armstrong received will find much to think about.ns in a post-script--her health problems during these years were certainly real but are unexplained, and she leaves the impression that they were caused by the convent--but I suspect that wasn't totally the case.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge is EXCELLENT!!!... This film is by far the best film of the year. The performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are great. They have great chemistry and can really sing well. I came into this movie thinking it would be dumb, because of the current music and the storyline, but I LOVED this film. All the performances were great, and so were the musical montages. I must say that Baz Luhrman does a great job with expressing his vision, if only hollywood would have more director's like that, than we would have great films. I applaud Baz Luhrman, Nicole Kidman, and Ewan McGregor for making this wonderful film. I really hope that this film might get some mild attention form the Academy Awards. Everyone must see this film, it is absolutely GREAT!!!...
B00003CY5K|5.0|We went to the 'sneak preview' of this movie. I wanted to see it since i like Reese Witherspoon movies. I didnt know what to expect. The whole theater was sold out, and everyone was laughing their heads off. There are a lot of one liners, and ill probably have to go again to hear the ones i missed when everyone was laughing. I have not had such a good time at a movie in a long while. Cant wait for this to come out sometime on DVD, I'll definately be buying it when it comes out to watch over and over.
6303114946|5.0|This is a wonderful, smart, and touching movie.  The chess is intriguing, the characters are enchanting, and the story is heartwarming.  A definite must-see!
B00003CXV4|4.0|I am a Keanu Reeves fan and would pay mony to see him stand still, BUT I thought this movie was great! Yes, its sappy and predictable, but its sweet, sad and sexy! Anyone who feels like a good cry and to have their faith in love renewed, should spend the time and money on this great romatic feature!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I don't have any of Rage Against The Machine's (RATM) other CD's so can't make a comparison, but if you like innovative music with a little harder edge, this one's for you.  These guys are definitely ..., and not all that happy about the system, but through the seriousness of it all, it's good music period.  You won't find too many light-hearted lyrics, so it's not always such an easy listen, but there is some amazing guitar work by Tom Morello and the intensity of singer's Zack De La Rocha screamed/rapped lyrics is actually catchy.  You will be drawn in by the radio play songs of, &quot;Testify,&quot; &quot;Guerilla Radio,&quot; and &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot; and then hooked by the amazing sounds and the mix of hip-hop heavy metal driving rhythm of the rest of the CD.  The incredible sounds these guys can coax out of their instruments are reason alone to buy the album.  It would seem they have to use some serious studio manipulations or obscure instruments to get those sounds, but as the liner notes testify, &quot;all sounds made by guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.&quot;  Pretty incredible to draw such disparate sounds and have it sound so good.  Some past groups that remind me of bits and pieces of RATM are, King's X for some of the driving guitar chords, Living Colour (not sure why), Henry Rollins for the political rapped voice, and the Beastie Boys for the innovative Rock and hip-hop mix.  This is definitely not one to listen around kids or in the office due to the language, but with headphones or in a car, turn it up, rock out, release a little rage, and enjoy.  You won't be disappointed.  Too bad these guys let some of their raging political anger spill out towards each other and broke up.  They could have made some more incredible sounds for years to come.  That's a long time to stay that intense though.
B000002UAR|5.0|this cd is with no question the best ever the Beatles composed. most of the critics say that sgt peppers is the top, but listening to both you will see that the main difference between them is that REVOLVER is the real top of the Beatles work. SGT PEPPERS is something different than pure Beatles. the masterpiece is called &quot;eleanor rigby&quot;, a piece of music for the centuries. near this we have &quot; i am only sleeping&quot;, &quot;here there and eveywhere&quot; and &quot;taxman&quot;, and and and....<br />unfortunately the less interesting song here was the biggest hit and thats &quot;yellow submarine&quot;. if REVOLVER had &quot; a day in the life&quot; too, could make mozart jealoys!!
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not your average teen-based book. I'ts a breath of fresh air from that &quot; Sally met Todd at summer camp and they went shopping but Todd tried to feel up her shirt so she slapped him and spent the night at her friends house. A makeover always did make her feel better...&quot; This book is down to earth and deals with problems teen-agers can relate to. You can't put this book down. You'll wish it never ends.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I admit that the only reason I bought the CD was because Ewan McGregor sings on it *swoon*. But that isn't why I listen to it 24/7. It has spectacular renditions of all the songs I love and has song for every mood. But DO NOT buy this CD before you watch the movie, it will defiantly spoil it. But if you have seen the movie, well then you know most of what's on the CD and you should defiantly get it!...P.S.S Diamond Dogs, One Day I'll FLy Away, Come What May, and Children of the Revolution are my favs on the CD.
