B000LZCEIK|5|we have used this twice on our grandbaby and he likes it more than his regular pacifier!  No problems with him keeping it in his mouth until the temp is ready to be read.
B00N897M5Q|5|Very large! It holds all my child's bath tub toys and is easy for him to empty!
B009ZU3KGW|5|Perfect for caring booster seat on the plan. We put the backless booster in this bag, and put the bag over the rolling suitcase handle. Perfect, and you didn't even have to think about it. We were able to gate check it in its case so we didn't have to worry about the booster picking up any germs or getting dirty as well. It held up well and seems well made.
B0052QYLUM|3|I have not had another video camera so I can only write about this one...<br />This a good priced monitor, very easy to set-up (just plug in and turn on!), and very easy to travel with. The range is slightly an issue but we have a very long hallway so this may not be a problem for you. Works in our bedroom great and kitchen and living room which is really all we need.<br />We have it mounted on the wall and still find it very easy to remove and travel with it.
B011329L2G|5|This bibs are FANTASTIC.  I always had issues with other bibs but these are better than the rest.  The fabric is SO soft and comfortable for my toddler.  And the designs are super fun.  Also cleaning is VERY easy.  Just throw them in the washer.  The plastic ones, food sticks to the surface and sometimes the washer doesn't always get it clean.  These are very simple.  Ordering more now!!
B002Y5XJL6|5|Love this product, love the fact that it came in camo. My neighbor took one look at it and said she wished she had something like that when her son was little! Rubber backing works great with any kind of cup or toys....I've even used it to keep some toys wrangled!
B00M7BO3NK|3|.....it was opened and that's what confuses me the most. I opened the envelope, and took out the night light packaging which was CRUSHED, thank god nothing happened to the bulb, but the plastic came straight off and I planned on giving it as a present, but it's going to have to come out regardless.
B00LFP6698|5|This is so beautiful and sturdy!  It arrived last night in a very thick and protected box.  I set it up several ways - first as the crib, then as the toddler bed and again as the full size bed.  It is beautiful no matter which way you set it up.  I believe the finish will last a very long time on it, as it is not the cheap and painted wood like years ago.  I'm very satisfied with this crib and look forward to many years of use of it.
B00N54GF4I|5|I recently borrowed this carrier from a friend & loved it so much that I had to order one for myself. The wide waist belt is great. I highly recommend this carrier.
B00INGNYXS|5|great product. Easy to install. Perfect view of the baby.
B0096AT0LU|2|Comforter is very small like for a crib mattress even though the picture is of a standard twin sized bed. Disappointed .
B005HP6XUO|1|These are horrible! At 8 months old my daughter could get the top off and dump these everywhere. Why can't they make it with a decent lid? Is it really so hard to make a lid that screws on?  The lid just presses on and pulls off. It's such a stupid design that I can't even fathom why they're still in production. I threw ours in the trash and bought better cups at Walmart. Boo.
B003Y53YR4|5|Easy to use , wheels ride very smoothly, collapses easily.  The car seat is very nice and adheres to safety standards.  The value prizing made this a must by for me , specially after looking at several in store (Baby's R Us, Wallmart, Target and boutique stores).
B0041P3GJM|3|sturdy chairs only the color is darker than it appears in this picture.
B00BEVSSUI|5|I love that the handle is removable, and the spout can also be converted to Nuk's straw cup accessory.  Washes well and didn't cloud over after washing. the frog on the side is super cute.
B00ASI748A|4|This system works really well. It is really easy to open the stroller and lock in the car seat. Downfall...stroller is huge and takes up your entire trunk and both stroller and car seat are heavier than I was expecting for something advertised as being lightweight.
B008KFISUG|3|Very cute bins. However, they are not sturdy enough and since they are made of fabric, the top doesn't really hold the square shape. The bottom does have support.
B000K21D4K|5|This rubber duck was a gift for my grandaughter. It is exactly what one would like such a bath toy to be; well made, a good size, weighted so it floats upright.
B001ABZGU2|4|Good quality.  No sharp edges.
B00005QI1G|5|From the very begining my daughter has loved this bouncer.  The vibration is just the right amount and soothes her to sleep when she isn't ready to lay down just yet.  With just one finger you can bounce the seat back and forth and my daughter found that very calming.  I think most babies like to keep moving.  At first the toys overtop seemed to get her overstimulated.  So it was very nice that they could be removed.  Now (4 months)she really enjoys the toys and all the noise she can make.  She has had a little acid reflux once in a while and the position she sits in when in the chair seems to relieve those symptoms.  Overall this is the item we've used the most.  She now likes to sit in it and watch Wiggles on Disney.  Really a great seat!!!!!
B00J7KU3LA|5|I chose this over the nosefrida because of the ability to clean it and not pay for filters. My daughter has had a nasty cold and after several days of use it has worked wonderfully. I can clean out my daughters nose much quicker than with the bulb aspirator and it seems to be more gentle. When I'm done, I can unscrew the bottom and rinse all the parts. I haven't gotten any boogies in my mouth or even up the tubing :)
B000OY539A|1|Hard to use. Hard to get my son into and out of. The workmanship was sub-par and not worth the money. Next time I would save my money.
B005DOS2EE|5|I really like the supergate deluxe decor metal gate. It's really nice and goes really well with our decor. I especially enjoy the fact that my puppy has its own separate area without destroying anything in our house. The gate ended up being too long for where we wanted to put it, but because of its ergonomic shape, we ended up placing it in a much better place. I’m a very happy customer.
B003H10D1U|5|I have the Joovy Jogger stroller (supper kooshy ride) and the kooper (yellow) for travel and portable around town stuff. I love them both. I've had the Kooper for a year and it works great on planes and in the car. I am used to the way it locks and it isn't a problem. The fabric is durable and stays remarkably clean. I had a tear in the seam and Joovy customer service is amazing. A PERSON answers the phone and takes care of you right away. That right there is worth buying a Joovy product. The canopy on both my Joovys is the reason I choose Joovy, and they work amazingly well. This is a great product. I wish more companies today worked the way this one does.
B00HYB09PO|5|These are adorable we haven't used them yet as our daughter was just born but we received them quickly and are happy with them.
B00TYNQA9Y|5|Love love love. My 7.5 month old still likes to be swaddled. These are big enough, and then some! It is light enough for him to stay cool, but warm enough to not wake up with chilly fingers. This is my new go to gift for baby showers. Just wish thr tag was a little smaller
B003ZYE7F2|5|So good!
B00000J4TE|5|I bought the Noahs Ark activity center for my daughter when she was  <br />12 weeks old and she loved it the second I layed her down on it. She is now 6 months old and although she  is always rolling off of it she still loves it.  She yells at the whale and seahorse that hang down and pulls them off even, it really is hysterical . I highly recommend this buy for anyone.
B000A6OLM2|5|Works GREAT
B0090OM1F4|5|Emma Jane has done it again.  I guess I'm addicted to these headbands as these were the 3rd set of bands that I recently purched.  I have not been dissapointed yet!
B0067GKHVS|5|I wasn't sure what the big deal was since I can handle a regular wipes container with one hand but this really does make it easier. A single wipe can easily be removed without having to shake and &#34;jerk&#34; it from the rest of them.
B000058CC7|5|Great baby gate! Love the hands free foot petal and the fact that it opens going both ways. It is very secure and hasn't moved a millimeter since we installed it. Great product! I highly recommend it.
B001DWG3V4|5|I go this for my daughter who was expecting her first child. She's since had her child and uses it all the time.
B00OJN7L3I|5|Worked great! Fit chicco keyfit 30 with plenty of room
B00C4RIGAS|1|After 40 days of trying this Blink1 camera and monitor everywhere app I offer this review:<br /><br />The setup was easy and the camera when it stay connected to the monitor (i-pad) works as stated. BUT...<br /><br />I receive an error message at least every other day? The wifi will drop the connection from the camera to the i-pad and beep. When I try to reconnect I get this message.<br />&#34;Can't start video stream the monitor is busy try again later (613)&#34;<br /><br />After receiving this message I will exit the program restart the program and I'm still unable to connect to the camera for usually around five to ten minutes.<br />The monitor everywhere tech-support told me to reset the camera, but the same issue continue.<br /><br />My son has health issues and needs to be monitored without interruptions.  If you want a dependable monitior to use with an<br />i-pad keep looking.  I read some questionable reviews, but I took a chance on this camera, because it was able to zoom & pan.<br />It was an expensive mistake.
B006I3HYC0|3|I only continued to purchase this because its cheaper than having to buy the bottles when I only need the nipples.
B003LQVZOK|3|Bought as a gift. Upon arrival, I took it out of the packaging to check it out.  It is quite smaller than I had thought, but very cute..
B0037NXG7G|5|I find that this is not good hearty enough for overnight, but I use this every day with a fitted for nap time! For nights, my disana never ever leaks.
B00834D5PC|5|This is a great car seat! I was easy to install and it very good quality. I know Britax is the best.. but when I went to a car seat safety event and had it checked out, the Sheriff, said I did a good job picking it out because it the best you can get. He said there are some that are a couple hundred dollars, but this is the better.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase. It was worth the money to know my kiddo is safe.
B0032G9E0G|5|We really love this bottle rack! It has a small footprint, but ends up holding a fair amount, and it looks great in our modern-decor home. If it helps, we use 8 oz glass bottles, and I am able to put about 12 of them on the grass at a time, and they are very well supported.
B00CCKC108|5|We used this for a two week trip around Germany and Switzerland for our 15-month-old, and it was absolutely perfect for that.  It fit in every space, and didn't take up a bunch of room when packed up.  I kept it up in the living room for about 10 days before the trip and we played in it, then used it for sleeping for the first time on the trip (when she was really tired).  She ended up loving it so much that she would crawl in and lie down on her own.  My only complaint is that it's hot in there; she almost always woke up sweaty, and our trip was in April.  But I'm so glad we found it.  I got it for $45 at Babies R Us.
B008P8EZOG|4|Favorite feature is that the monitor turns off and then only comes on when baby is making noise! This is so much nicer at night so you don't have the hear any feedback by keeping the volume on all the time.  Had an older Levana monitor and like that model so much we got this new one which does have more features like music and talk ability, but buttons aren't as friendly. overall I really like it
B001F6NJQA|5|This thing is fantastic!! It's SOLID. I don't worry about its durability at all. Definitely worth the money and my 21-month-old son loves it. It was a piece of cake to put together (no extra tools were required!)  and I love that I can adjust the height as he grows. A no brainer!
B00DHFJUQK|5|I love this diaper bag. It has a nice fabric that wipes clean but isn't vinyl or plastic feeling. It is very stylish and a perfect size. It has many pockets for organization.
B00AO083M8|4|This swing was easy to assemble and goes longer than I expected per set of batteries.  It isn't too noisy and the baby seems to find it comfortable and comforting.  My only complaint is that the crosspiece with the toys dangling from it comes off too easily.
B00ACSLSVK|5|I saw today my granddaughter wearing this tights . They look great, and comfortable . They fit PERFECT ! ... Not too loose and not tight ... just the way they should ! Great material . and very stretchy ... It has little rubber dots on the floor standing so the baby doesn't get slipped ... They are great !!
B000056JC1|5|I have struggled to sleep with the usual wedge for my allergies and sinus issues. I wanted a smaller wedge to use with my extra firm pillow, and this does the trick well. The doctor is happy because I am able to breathe better with this little bit of lift, and I am happy because I feel like I can actually lay down and not feel like I am sitting up to sleep!
B0080E6AIY|5|Good to use it in winter for my son
B000MRK5MO|2|I bought these Born Free bottles and nipples, switching away from Avent, mainly b/c of they are bpa-free.   The Born Free bottles and nipples are so diappointing in every way.  First of all, they are harder to clean (extra 2 piece valve).  The bottles leak from the screw on neck.  The nipples collapse consistently.  Nothing could be more frustrating than dealing with these product issues when you have a hungry baby to feed. Finally, I switched back to the Avent nipples which work on these bottles.   If you do buy this product, DON'T invest in the nipples- just use Avent nipples. I am sorry I invested so much $$ in this system..and would just like to warn others on the disappinting performance.
B000O7SR18|5|good quality, good fit
B00DB507V8|5|good
B006JA64YG|1|The image showed this large enough to fit over a wide-brimmed hat. That was my plan, to drape it over my hat; however, it is barely big enough to drape over my head. So, I would have to wear it under my hat and it would be right on my face. I can't see how that's useful. In Florida, bugs land on fabric that's close to skin and bite right through it. I can't use this at all.
B006WHR6CU|1|Water does not come out even after sucking on it very hard. So I guess it doesn't leak but child also can't drink out of it.
B0033UWT8A|5|I have a mommy hook and its great but with my double stroller I have plenty of room hang packages, its nice that it allows me to hang stuff so easily
B000JJOBOI|3|This worked well for a while, but at three months, my daughter gets frustrated because she cannot reach the toys.  By the time she'll be able to reach them, she will most likely have outgrown the seat. <br />
B00CMHYKNC|3|Considering how inexpensive it is; it's okay. Was not as easy to assemble as I'd thought it'd be. The reason I bought a plastic bed is, my daughter was chewing the bar on her wooden crib. It's not very sturdy but it should probably hold up until my toddler stops chewing everything and we can get a real wood bed.
B000BXHPEU|5|This is such a great little invention. It folds up so compact that I can drop it into a gallon freezer bag, and put it in my purse and leave the diaper bag at home! It provides handles so my daughter doesn't have to put her hands on the public toilet to rest. We haven't had any problems with pinching or anything with the covered hinges, but every once in a while, if she isn't positioned properly with her legs closed enough, we have had a couple of instances of the pee shooting forward onto her clothes... :( But really, I think you'll have that with any little inset potty seat. The openings are pretty small on most of them. Just takes a little practice. For me, it didn't detract from it's overall functionality. The fact that I was able to use it in a port-a-john without worries sealed the deal. ;) It's great for under $10.
B002SW3AYQ|3|I am not sure what is wrong with this blanket with an established reputation, the quality going down or they sell different stuff on amazon? I have washed them several times but there is still lint ball attached as one of the reviews said.<br />What is worse is that the lint attached to baby's skin especially when there is sweat or moisture.
B007RVSVEM|5|The rubber from the handles on my maclaren stroller were disintegrating. It was a sticky and gross situation. These grips solved the problem. I should have ordered this item a lot sooner.
B000H1MRJO|5|It's a great size for children up to 75 pounds.  I intend to put it in a canoe bottom to keep stuff off the floor that I don't want wet.
B00OEUGC3Q|5|Great warm coat.  My daughter loves it!
B00155WJRG|4|I was a little dissapointed with how these nipples seated with some of our Parents Choice bottles . Overall they are working fine
B00AMY6QCK|1|Truly, it is made in China.<br />mouth be off to the side.<br />eyes is unbalance.<br />It is very regrettable.<br />A child is pitiful.
B001ABZGU2|1|waste of money ... we don't use.. put them in door jam like suggested and it damages the wood
B005IWNNK4|2|Not work will not power on. will return reordered another hopefully not same problem Will keep you posted.Multiple power sources tried
B007UYBOK4|4|I think it looks great - however it is only forward facing.  Now they are recommending kids to be rear facing until 2 years old and my lil' guy is only 6 mo. so I had to find another convertible car seat to cover the in-between time (between the infant car seat and this one).
B00KDKKD1I|5|Great pillow. Perfect sized and thickness for my two year old. She loves having a pillow. She was using her blanket under her head at night and we decided it was time to get her a real pillow, but an adult pillow seemed to big/thick for her little bed. It was her special treat for giving up her pacifier that she still used at night. FYI- it worked!
B00IAIXPSS|5|Item was better than expected from the picture. The packaging used bubble wrap and the frame came in its own covered box with protective material on the inside of that. I have been leary about shipping frames for purposes of frame/glass breaking or being damaged. This was one of the best ones as far as shipping goes and the frame was exactly what we were looking for.
B002NUWQUM|2|Great idea, pretty good quality of materials. This is made of a nice soft material that feels nice against your skin. It's also got what seems like heavy duty elastic to hold it up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it does not support the flanges and bottles very well, leaving the weight of the milk filled bottles to tug on your nipples. This could not have been a sizing issue, since it was tight nearly to the point of being painful and I could barely zipper it on.<br /><br />On the other hand, the sizing chart seems to be inaccurate. I was on the border of small and medium, but the medium was terribly tight.<br /><br />The other problem I found that may or may not affect others is that the holes did not align with my nipples properly, causing the flanges to tug uncomfortably. In the end, I returned this and am continuing the search for a hands free bra that's an improvement over my holes-in-sports-bra method.
B002WB2GAM|5|This is light and easy to fold and push. It's perfect for running errands.  The recline on it is fine for my 2 year old when he naps. He seems comfortable in the stroller.
B000RFAAEO|5|They work fine.  I wish they were easier to clean for when you use them with fatty liquids that stain.  But, these directions say to use a Q-tip.  So far, that's been working satisfactorily.
B006YBHE6M|5|LOve it!!!
B000BNQC58|5|I bought one of these for each of my children and we all love them!  My husband now wants to buy one for our room. :)  We have had the same batteries since we got the turtles in March and they are still going strong.  Highly recommend this product.
B007BEHSDU|5|Used these to take my son with me to the movies.  We wanted to be a part of my four year old's movie experience and didn't want to be left out.  My baby was five months and he wasn't able to swat them off his head. They worked great and he slept through the entire movie at the theatre, didn't scare himself with any loud noise.
B00AJF7R3E|4|Very excited to try this out with my God-Son. He was born premie, 4lbs, and this is the pacifier they have him. Hoping he takes to it again.<br />My one problem is, Levi is a lot smaller than he looks in pictures. My one concern is if it detaches or not. The company says it does, yet parents say it doesn't. I haven't opened it yet so I'm not sure. If it doesn't, that's not a good thing. But hey if he loves it, so be it !
B001B9QNN2|2|My twins loved this toy. It really is a great toy for most intents and purposes. It has great colors, is put together well, has fun sounds, and offers the kinds of things that babies and toddlers love in a toy. It was a big hit in our home, at least until it stopped working after a couple of months of use. We thought it was dead batteries so we used a special triangle screwdriver to get to the battery compartment and went out to purchase the batteries. The batteries cost $7.50 each and it takes 3 of them. It would cost about three times what the toy costs to replace the batteries. After reading another review I'm not sure the battery is the reason the toy stopped working. With such a short lifespan, I feel guilty just having to throw it away. I like for toys to have years of life in them for many children to enjoy. It's better for our budget and better for the environment. I'm very disappointed with the product now.
B005I4DZO6|5|This swaddle is so cute,  we did an owl theme for my daughters baby shower and this was a perfect gift!
B00635MEGO|3|Love the shaver but the blue foam stains the skin.  Not so great.
B00005C5H4|1|These cups are not worth the money that is being charged.  The display pictures make them look much bigger than they are. In fact the smallest cup could be a choking hazard for smaller kids.  You are better off buying measuring cups at K-mart for $3.00.
B004L2JWX4|4|It's ok, nothing great but for the price it is all I expect it to be.  Only thing I don't like is sound it makes when you rock.  You hear the oil in the joints, but it is not that much of a sound.  I am happy with it overall and would purchase again.
B00Q871EM2|5|Simple and nice
B000JIMO7A|5|I just bought the second one for my second son.  My elder son has been using it for 1.5 years.  Love the New Denim material. Much cooler then other materials.  My sons get hot easily in California weather.  He always sweet in his old carseat.  The new Denim is much better.  Marathon is easy to install.  Just to remember that it is a hugh seat.  Better try it out in rear-facing position before you buy.  I have to move the front seat a bit to forward to accomodate it.  Luckily, I just need to do it for a few short months, then my son can use it forward-facing.
B009M68BUE|2|I actually bought 2 of these. I bought 1 for my grandson and 1 for the neighbor. The first one I received was EXCELLENT! Had the drum on the top that worked and all the batteries worked. I received the 2nd one later and it was disappointing. It had no usable drum on the top (just a soft top that lights up but doesn't make noise...BUMMER!), all the instruments came with no battery life, replaced batteries and the guitar and horn thing still do not work. Loved the first one with a drum...wish I hadn't given that one to the neighbor.
B000WUB9R6|3|We received this swing as a gift for my son, and are not overly impressed by it.   Cons: 1. It is very annoying to assemble  2. It only buckles on the bottom. A 5 pt harness is a lot safer, especially if your infant can sit up. (My son sits all the way forward which i totally not safe... if the buckle gets loose- he can fall!)  3. Only two speeds. (For a while I had another swing which we borrowed, and the faster speeds put my son to sleep instantly. He does not like to sit in this swing at all and usually cries when I try to put him in.)  4. The toy bar is garbage, it does not stay in place, and the toys are silly. (Once my son was old enough to reach for it, he was able to pull it off easily and it would poke him in the face- very DANGEROUS! We do not put it up ever.)  5. If your infant's hands wander too much to the sides, they can get caught between the metal bars!  6. Careful when you wash the material, the color does run-even in cold! (Our seat's cover is yellow, hence the yellowish tinge to several other things that were washed in that delicate load).    and the Pros: 1. Very sturdy  2. The rocking chair is nice to have, even for an older child... (but purchasing a plain rocking chair is much more worth it!)  3. Easy to wash the seat cover if it gets dirty (but the light yellow isn't the best idea since this seats best use is as a rocker to an older child).  4. Good battery life (could be because we do not use it very often).  OVERALL RATING: It is good in theory... but don't waste your money! There are better ones out there-- keep looking!
B000N8K5WC|5|It's hard to tell how big the fish is in the picture, but he's justa  little guy and just right for baby.  My 6 month old is 19 pounds and it fits his wrist just fine.  Love it!!  He always has a convenient soft plushie to chew on now!
B001DF67H6|1|the shades are really cute but I can not get them to stick to the windows longer than a couple minutes..they just fall off.  the suction cups are too hard and stiff I think...no flexibility.   I will try to warm them up to see if it helps.
B001HKPHYQ|5|I'm giving this 5 stars because I think it's a really cute idea for a nightlight, and because ours has worked just fine for us so far. (I've seen lots of other reviews saying theirs didn't hold up; I'll change my review if ours breaks too easily, but for now I'm not taking that into account.) The color-changing mode is fun to watch, even for adults. I think it's neat to have a nightlight that older kids can have in the bed with them, and the option to dim after 15 minutes is a smart one.    Ours is for our 7-month-old, but I think Amazon really has it miscategorized as a \\"Baby\\" item. The package clearly states it's for 2 years and up. Our son is fascinated by his Tykelight and loves to hold it, but of course we only let him have it when he's closely supervised. However, his fascination with it has helped in a few situations where we really wanted to keep him content. There's no reason it couldn't be in a nursery as a nightlight, but I think most babies sleep better without a nightlight. It's really not enough light to change a middle-of-the-night diaper, either.
B000K53UEI|5|Love this drying rack. Holds all my bottles/nipples/breastpump equipment. They dry within 3-4 hours. I was fascing problems with mold on lids because they would not dry properly when placed with dishes on dish drying rack. But that is no longer a problem. It even has a little area to collect dripping water. Great price and great product.
B001WAJVZM|4|Fits our antique-style spout well.
B007A0C3XU|5|I'm so happy with this bag. It is so cute, easy to clean, has tons of room and pockets, and I get complimented on it everywhere I go. The side pockets are perfect for bottles and the front ones are perfect for diapers. The rest of my stuff fits easily on the inside.
B00BEVF1X0|3|It is a good safe seat, but difficult to adjust the tension of the pull straps.
B001CWIW6O|5|Great fitting smooth finish , soft and comfortable I would not hesitate to buy this again. Excellent quality washes, and dries well
B007LWC472|4|I just got this package and it on my wall. I love it so much, I just ordered another package to stick on the other side of the room
B00M04KDSS|5|These cups are great and my daughter took right to them. No more baby bottles and these hardly leak after she throws them down. Not cool about the throwing part, but hopefully that will improve. Fast shipping too!
B00029T4D8|5|Nice soft booster for my young one to use.  Grips a little bit to the chair but slides some what.  My little one loves it and uses it daily.
B00005BTB1|4|This product is great for night feedings.  I used with playtex nurser bottles/inserts.  The one thing I do however is check the temp of the formula while the light is still on and the warmer is still going.  There have been times when the formula has gotten too warm.  Other than that, this product helps to avoid making those 3:00am trips to the kitchen or bathroom to make/warm up a bottle.
B007K3CYEA|5|These bibs do an awesome job. I initially bought them as a fluke, liking the patern, but shortly after when my husband fed our son and it caught everything, i mean everything, he loved it! It catches everything from crumbs to soup. I have bought 8 (leaving some at parents place) and only one had a snap break off. I cannot say any have gotten mold. This is the absolute best bib, especially if your little one likes to rip it off, it's impossible to do so :).<br />All in all, every child is different and situation as well, but for me it's a 5 star product, and would even buy this for someone expecting.
B00KNJBB60|3|looks okay... it's just what I need
B004AV0GXG|3|Broke within 5 months
B001OC5UNK|3|gate is ok and a bit wider than several others but it's not as stable as I'd like.  We use it for a dog gate and it does well but I'd imagine a 2 year old probably being able to loosen it up.
B001RTTO46|5|This change pad cover is a lot cuter and softer than what I was expecting and I'm glad I got the green and white dots.  It goes with the couch in our baby's nursery.
B00GEZEDVM|5|great
B005PNHWPI|5|This is a super alternative when you're going somewhere and don't need the full diaper bag.  It has a wipe container, fits 4-7 diapers, depending on the size, a spare onesie, thin wallet and iPhone.  Personally, I would just use this as-is and wouldn't stick it into another bag because it would be too bulky and make the bag too heavy.  I keep this packed, in addition to the regular diaper bag, so I can take this if needed.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
B004044LD4|5|very good
B00M3ACDSW|5|This is a very nice lightweight stroller.  I did not pay the price listed here.  Toys R Us is selling the same stroller way cheaper.
B000IDSLOG|5|I had one of these when I was a child, and bought one for my son.  He LOVES it!!  The first moment out of the package he was reaching for it.  Now he chews on it all the time.  The giraffe is made of soft plyable rubber that bends easy but doesn't tear/rip.  It is perfect for little hands to grab onto.  It wipes clean with a wet cloth or baby wipe.  The coloring doesn't rub off.  It is a great toy!
B003U2SPC0|5|bought these for my daughter when she begain to breast feed and it made it more confortable for her to continue to breast feed.
B000QFY8UM|5|THIS IS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON AND SEEMS LIKE A BASIC NECESSITY IN ANY LITTLE GIRL'S WARDROBE.  CAN USE IT AS A SLIP, DRESS, PLACE PANTS/SHORTS UNDERNEATH FOR A DIFFERENT LOOK OR EVENTUALLY OVER TIME COULD BE USED AS A BABY DOLL SHIRT.  EVEN HAS ORGANIC COTTON UNDER THE ISLET HOLES FOR COVERAGE.  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCTS AND EVEN BETTER CHOICE B/C IT IS ORGANIC!
B004I8VBZ8|5|I purchased the Woombie Donut for my grandson when he was 2 months old. I purchased it from the Woombie website and am very pleased with the purchase. He is just a 1 week shy of being 10 months and is still able to use it. My main concern when purchasing the Woombie Donut was to insure that when he was out and about with his parents, that he had his own personal space for which he could be laid upon, It is soft, comfortable, durable,cozy and very portable. I highly recommend this product and am a fan of woombie products.
B009SYEVXG|5|It's gorgeous and well made. It looks exactly like the picture posted. The face is cute, the cheeks are blushed, the stuffing is just right, and the price is fantastic. The only downside is that it took a month to get here, and I missed an anniversary date. Oh, well. That's my fault not theirs. I would definitely buy one or two more in the near future. Thanks!
B0002ZOI92|5|My son loves his big swing, however since I was on vacation in Florida at my parents I couldn't pack it to take with me. So my parents bought this traveling swing for him. It was awesome because it made my baby happy & allowed me to eat, visit etc. I have used this swing to take with me on many outings. It is very portable & durable!
B00BMVDQES|3|Lunaura Baby Keepsake, baby girl bottle with Crystals key chain was good choice for my new baby' shower. But I expected a different matterial.
B007A2ZQEG|5|It's a good package that has little bit of everything you need
B005CMI404|5|Love this product. Got it for my daughter. Soft material and so far, hasn't faded from washing.
B00000IZQI|5|My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!
B005FIA1CO|5|We have used our size large Planet Wise wet bag for about three years now. I wash it when I wash the cloth diapers and within the past year have started line drying rather than using the dryer. We hang it on a hook that is on our changing table. Lately, when it gets full, the snap comes undone and the bag falls to the floor. Also, the outer cloth layer is showing some significant wear and starting to come apart near the hanging loop. I'm sure if we didn't hang the bag (especially so full) it would not be coming apart in that spot. Since the inner layer is not compromised, we can still use the bag just fine; it just is starting to look a little ratty. I am probably going to buy a replacement soon and will probably get the same thing again because I love it!
B002UD65YU|3|Pros:<br />1. Nice, suede-like material. Feels very soft and cool to the touch<br />2. Does not make crinkly noises like other waterproof pads<br />3. Looks like it will stay put and not move around - though you do need a fitted sheet over it to protect your infant<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Too small. Description on Amazon says 28x52, but product packaging says 27x50. Leaves gaps around the mattress on top. I knew this was not a fitted pad, but I was at least expecting it to cover the entire top of the mattress.<br />2. Very thin, almost like a sheet. No padding. Probably won't absorb much.<br />3. Cons 1 and 2 above imply that its likely your mattress will get wet if an accident does occur.<br /><br />I can't get myself to return it given the price, but this is clearly not going to do its job. It will have to do until I pick up something else at a local big-box store.
B00HAZSBIG|1|does not work at all. The bubbles pop immediately and do not make it into the air. Got a refund from Amazon pretty easily, but didn't enjoy the hassle.
B0081C9UO6|5|Fun bath toy for the little guy!  He loves dunking them under water and watching as the water trickles out the bottom!
B000I2WB6G|5|I read lots of reviews before purchasing this bouncer and saw that some people mentioned very loud music, toys hanging too low and some clicking sound as the main issues with it. I don't find the music being too loud whatsoever, there are two setting, the lower one is really low and the louder one is not too loud at all.  The toys do hang low but that's because the baby is supposed to reach and touch them in order for the music to start playing.  My baby likes the bouncer and I think it is a great bouncer for the price.
B000JIHP88|5|Love the product.  didn't expect how beautiful it is until my husband assembled it.  Love the different music and the moving animals and most of all we love how it automatically turns off after 15 mins to save battery or in case you fell asleep.
B001KYZWI0|5|I've had this for the last 16 months and I still love it and use it! In the kitchen at the store around the neighborhood...so useful, pretty and practical. I love keeping my baby close and having my hands free.  I barely use my stroller because My baby and I love this wrap.
B000HIP38Y|4|This product has worked very well from day one. We are still using it in the infant bathtub. The only negative that I have is that if you dont shake out all of the water once you have removed it from the tub it will start beeping once the excess water temp gets too low. Sometimes I have to shake the water out 2-3 times because it will suddenly start beeping again.
B00DDUM1CY|3|rattles weren't really rattles.  Very little noise made
B00003TL7P|5|While I was in the hospital on bed rest with our twins, my husband broke our diaper genie. He was frustrated putting in<BR>the refill and didn't find the directions..anyways, I am so glad<BR>he broke it or we wouldn't have bought the Diaper Champ! It easy<BR>to use, no more refills, you can use any garbage bag and put more diapers in it. Our 1 1/2 year old enjoys disposing of<BR>his diapers. It is that easy! Helpful Hint, just give it a spray<BR>of lysol after you empty it.<BR>Mom,Dad &amp; our three sons
B00B64AY5A|5|Good price and works well
B00JL4OT9Y|4|gave it as a gift and is now loved to death. Came fast and was clean
B000096M2Z|4|I have been using these bowls for a few days and so far, they are perfect for baby's little portions. What I like most is that they stack very well on top of each other, both bowls and lids together, saving space. I recently re ordered some more.
B002ZG7JQA|5|This is perfect for anyone who has limited space. Is made with great quality and easy to put together. Looks beautiful. Color finish makes it look like an expensive piece of furniture for a reasonable price.Recommend to buy the Cresent 50 coil davinci mattress fits snug and made well. Overall very happy with our purchase. Just now to wait for our little man to get here.
B00COB7PJW|4|A bit low, but it's okay cause my son crouches down and its easier to push. Very good product. Totally recommend.
B007U3EY3Y|5|My 9 yo daughter loved this for halloween. At the time she was about 51&#34; tall and 58#.  It was so cute, we painted her face like a fox and she looked awesome.
B00GA2QRWC|1|Doesn't fit my doorknobs where i can open it. So, yes it prevents the toddler and EVERYONE from turning it and opening the doors.
B001E5CDX2|5|We've heard a lot about Britax and chose not to get one when our son was newborn, as I wanted a seat that I would be able to carry with him in it.  Once he was too big for that one, I looked around and couldn't find another that had better safety reviews.  He loves his big boy seat so much.  We have no problem getting him in and out of it.  After we bought the first, we bought a second for the other car.  It IS quite large, the largest of the seats available, but totally worth it.  I have family in the state police, when they installed the seat, they said that this was the best seat we could have purchased.  Totally worth the money, this is our life sitting in this seat to be protected, there's no price you can put on that.  If we need to buy another seat in the future, this will definitely be the one we will buy.  If you plan on moving this seat from car to car though, you may want to think again, it's not easy to install because it is so big and it's heavy, the more you move them, the more likely you are to install it incorrectly.
B0031KMAJK|5|Absolutely fantastic and beautiful. We bought two of the cribs for our twin grandbabies.  The babies sleep well in them. Very well made and they were pretty much what we expected in the way of assembly. We bought serta mattresses for them and they fit perfectly.
B005LRR6BI|5|This diaper bag is a must have!! Everything about it is great, from all the different compartments inside to the bottle holders on each side, I just love it. You can fit a lot of items inside this bag and it is really convenient to have a section for your personal stuff. I would recommend this bag to all mothers out there.
B001GQ2SA2|5|I have had this mobile since my daughter was born.  As soon as she was able to sit up, she figured out how to push the buttons herself and turn the projection back on if she woke in the middle of the night (the hanging animals came down at this point).  This self-soothing techinque saved her (and mommy) a lot of sleepless nights.  I have actually witnessed her reach up with her foot, hit the button with her toe, and go soundly back asleep.  My daughter is now 27 months old and is still in love with her \\"animals,\\" and turns it on each night as part of her bedtime routine and names each animal as it passes by.  I also like the remote which I keep on her door handle.  This allows me to turn on the projection before I walk into check on her.  At night, the projection is bright enough for me to see her and navigate her room.  This is a much used/abused toy, yet I only change the batteries about twice a year. My biggest problem now is that this devise attaches to the side of a crib, which is fine in her converted crib/toddler bed.  I am moving her to a twin bed soon and am having a hard time finding something to replace this (that features both moving projections and music)!  This was a \\"must-have\\" item for us and I am not looking forward to having to \\"retire\\" it!
B007700SE4|5|Baby loves this toy
B0009XBWLY|1|Broke/ripped in 3 days! Little legs can rip it no problem. Waste of money. Do not buy!
B0042D69VU|5|ok
B005CMI3UA|5|My daughter loves it!
B00DIXQ2LC|5|Love it!!!
B0067ZBRW2|3|Our newborn does surprisingly well on the roadtrips to the doctor's office for checkups and we were happy to get this.<br /><br />After a month or so of usage though as first-time parents, we can only fairly give this 3 stars.<br /><br />Our Dislikes:<br />==============<br />First, the plastic cradle is very hard and the \\"padding\\" is like one-layer thin.  When I put my hand on it, I feel how hard the plastic is.  So hard that when we use this, we cushion it with a folded over plush blanket.<br /><br />Second, the music is inaudible.  I've pushed on the UP-Volume button 50 times and it does not get any louder.  When you actually turn on the \\"rumble\\" portion of the seat, you cannot hear the already inaudible music over the sound of the internal motor.  Maybe ours is defective, but you might as well just write-off that your baby is not going to hear the audio part.<br /><br />Third, the design is a little silly.  The car-seat \\"rumble\\" lasts for 60 minutes, but when it is finished, the Power LED light stays on.  In fact even with no music and no \\"rumble\\" the Power LED stays on.  This is minor, but I think the Power LED light should be on when the thing is actually on and off when the thing is actually off.  I should be able to glance at it and know for sure if it is off or on, especially since it is powered by 4 \\"D\\" batteries that you don't want to have to keep replacing.<br /><br />Fourth, our 1.5 month old baby at ~9lbs and 22\\" fits this just right.  We had friends over who had a 16lb baby boy and a 20lb baby girl and the PACKAGING states this car seat soother is good for 25lbs but in reality, there's no way!!  I think 16lb is the absolute MAXIMUM before they are going to get too big for this, so keep that in mind!  At 9lbs, or newborn fits in this a little too well.<br /><br />What we do Like:<br />=================<br />Simply the fact that this works just well enough.  Meaning, the ability to eat dinner with your wife (even if we scarf it down in 20 minutes) evenonce is worth the price of this car seat soother.  We have used it a few times when the baby is a little fussy and dinner was getting cold, it worked for the 20 minutes we needed and what a blessing! :-)<br /><br />That being said, we also have an electronic swing with adjustable (and loud) volume and adjustable speeds.  Though it cost a bit more, it's more versatile.  It will serve us well for probably up to 30lbs and it works to soothe a fussy baby enough that we can finish our dinner, etc.<br /><br />The carseat soother sits on the floor, whereas the bottom of the swing cradle is a foot or more above the ground and our dog stays away from it.  The carseat soother our dog could (but doesn't) jump on it...<br /><br />The size and portability of the carseat soother is also nice, but if you only have the budget for one of these, then an electronic swing is more versatile in the long term.<br /><br />So 3 stars since our baby will quickly out grow this, the plastic is so hard it requires additional padding, the music is inaudible and our electronic swing by the same manufacturer provides us the same benefit.
B000WIBFCC|1|As first-time parents of twins, we were looking for a simple and inexpensive humidifier. What we purchased instead was this poorly engineered and consequently dangerous product. Nearly every time we placed the tank on the base, water leaked out of the back of the unit. Trust me, 1.5 gallons is a lot of water when it leaks out all over your carpet. In our case, the water leaked out far enough to reach the extension cord powering the unit. The first night, I found the puddle of water with my foot during a late night feeding and I could have been electrocuted! We tried every which way to make sure the tank was securely sealed, but finally gave up.     I wish I had read some reviews before I purchased this product. It is beyond me that big name stores like Babies-r-Us and WalMart would carry such a dangerous product!
B004919TPS|5|you must always have a spare one!!!! quality just as the one in the baby bjorn, wish it was a little more resistant to machine wash but it´s okay...
B000JWEXCA|5|Love this shampoo/body wash. Been using it for over 5 years, now on my second daughter. So gentle and the smell is so subtle and addictive. Don't know what that strong smell comment is about.
B0050GD2EK|4|Silly that something like this doesn't come with the stroller... Oh well. It's useful but sits really high. It took a long time for my son to see over it.
B0077RT9HY|4|I bought these bibs to announce my pregnancy to my sister who would soon be an auntie!  The bibs are very cute and good quality.  I rated 4 stars instead of 5 only because they were not as soft as the ones in the Carters store I have been into, they were a little different feel than what I had thought.  Overall though very cute and I am sure will be great when the baby comes!
B00008ODBG|5|this is great so that my daughters have the items that they use at home here when they visit me.
B0041RRZ1U|5|I just bought this bag at burlington for 35 dollars its a pretty decent sized bag fits all my necesities<br />Love the color i have it in the cream links.<br />Its very spacious inside especially when you unzip the middle it does make it larger (i thought it didnt at first)<br />inside i carry 6-7 size 3 diapers<br />100ct pack of wipes<br />3 onsies<br />1 pair of pants<br />socks<br />Medicine bag<br />My wallet<br />Pen and notepad<br />Teething ring<br />Changing pad<br /><br />This is my out all day diaper bag its wonderful! I love it! If u are looking for a diaper bag you'll love this one<br /><br />*edit*<br />I have owned this diaper bag for almost a year and it has held up wonderfully i even washed in the washer and hung it out to dry and it looked like new! it has had a few loose strings but it is not ripped anywhere!<br />and i am not gentle with this bag its thrown, on the floor dragged by my 4 yr old and its still beautiful! i also stuff it to the max sometimes and it doesn't give up on me!<br />I love this diaper bag! I will sure reccomend to any mom to be!
B00008ODBG|3|We have a newborn son, and decided to purchase this wipe warmer for the nursery.    It does a good job of keeping the wipes warm so it doesn't startle our son when we use them on him.    However, it will dry out wipes (and turn them yellow) if you don't use the Prince Lionheart refresh pads w/ it (and keep the pad refreshed on a weekly basis).  Anyone thinking about buying this product should understand that they are signing up for buying the refresh pads as well.  A single pad lasts about 3 months, and 2 come in a pack.  If you use them as directed, you will never have wasted wipes due to drying or yellowing.    I agree w/ other reviewers that the \\"pull-through\\" doesn't work well for our wipes.  We use Huggies wipes, and we frequently have to manually feed another wipe through so it is ready to pull at the next use.  Sounds like other brands of wipes seem to work a bit better.    The other design issue we have w/ this product is that the lid frequently pops open on its own.  It seems like a design issue w/ the latch/button on the top.  We had to solve the problem by resting a clean diaper on top of the wipe warmer to keep the lid closed.  This is obviously annoying.    In general, we are glad we purchased a wipe warmer.  However, we realized after the purchase that its use is limited to the nursery.  When we are out running errands, we use cold baby wipes.  When we change the baby in any room other than the nursery, we use cold baby wipes.  I think we'd purchase one again, but I don't think we realized when we purchased it how limited the use actually would be.
B004GCJML6|4|Little tabs stay pulled out if you remove from socket a few times. Baby did pull one out already!
B0060JJGBO|2|We bought to keep our 11 month old busy on the plane. It worked for about 5 seconds. The button on the flower fell off during our first flight. The mirror is useless, you can't see anything in it. The other toys weren't interesting enough or were for an older age group (zippers and clips). The only thing she really liked on this was the little dog toy, which we detached and she played with in her carseat.
B0033UWSYK|3|Stitching coming undone well was like that right out of the package. I probably should have returned it.<br /><br />Cheaply made, I guess I should have expected that since the price was so low.<br />It is better than having nothing b/w my son and grocery carts. Gives me a little piece of mind, I will have to mend it soon though.
B002UKKVIY|4|We like this stroller so far. Only concern is that the seat is not very stable compared to the fixed seat.  This may be the potential safety issue.
B005XTKJAY|1|We had to throw them away. With any slight tip the contents would spill out. Same with the 11oz cup.
B000RFCSMQ|4|Due to the design of this brush and the ability to store it handle down in the Munchkin bottle drying rack, the water drains into the nipple brush part and causes it to smell like mildew. This could be avoided by hanging the brush to dry, but after a while the nipple brush doesn't stay in the handle as tightly so the brush will just fall down. That being said this is an excellent brush.  It cleans very well and last 2-3 months with heavy use. We used to have a dishwasher and would just run the brush through there to clean it so we could make it last longer. Now that we don't have a dishwasher we may have to replace the brush more like every month or so, but for the price, that is fine. I would recommend this brush to other people due to it's cleaning ability. Also, we kept the nipple brush out of out first one because it does work well and if it isn't stored in the handle it doesn't get that mildewy smell to it.
B00C9833O6|3|I love my spare parts I got for my freestyle medela. The only problem I have with this is how expensive it was!
B00CJ3FJK2|5|it came it and looked great for photo cant wait to order more in different colores, my sister loved it
B0006TNC1O|5|My twin sons are 5 months old, and this is the only seat they have ever used (as well as my 24 month old daughter)     Take it from me, its easier (and cheaper!) to purchase a convertable from the beggining. This means you dont have to transition to the change of removible carrier to large convertable, and babies are usually much safer in the convertables. It also saves you money since you have one less carseat to buy, and maybe one less stroller to buy (doesnt have to hold the carrier). I think its similar to if you think you should train a boy to sit on the potty and THAN to stand, or if you would rather it be less confusing and teach them to stand from the beggining... If you want to have the few conviniences over the economical choice, than go for a carrier... Basically this seat works WONDERS from the VERY BEGGINING, (of course you need to purchase head support and stuff)     I love that the carseat is easy to install into my mini van, two in the second row, one seat down and my daughters in the back. I also love that they are easy to move from car to car and are safe with the LATCH or not, they are just terrific! Its really easy to strap them in since theres velcro on the sides to \\"attatch\\" the harness onto, taking it out of the way, but this velcro doesnt irritate the babies. The harness is a five-point (not regulated on some carriers, I am not sure about convertables though) and is VERY comfortable and secure. Even with my premies the straps stay put and dont slide off of their shoulders, niether does my daughters. I also love the ease of adjusting for the weather, if baby has a heavy jacket on you can turn a knob and extend the width to fit them. But adjusting the hieght settings of the harness takes removing the cover to do, but who does that too much anyway? I LOVE the plush fabric, its comfortable and hugs my children. It keeps them warm in the winter, yet allows air to flow through in the summer. Its easy to wipe up small spills, or take it off to washit in the washing machine. Its very durable and hasnt shown any signs of wear, it also comes in a variety of patterns and colors for whatever your tastes are. The seat reqlines well for rearfacing, and its easy to do and you DONT need a pool noodle or a papertowel roll like in some carseats (very dangerous). I love that the carseat can hold many sized children, and sits them up high enough to see out the windows and arent too big to fit all of them in my Mini Van or my husbands Explorer. For an average car you could definatly fit two and be able to have an extra seat in the back, or fit all three and only allow a passenger in the front.     I love our seats, they are great for all ages, although they can only hold 45 lbs, as opposed to the Marathons 60 lbs. I love them, easy to use and have the famous and safe Britax name.
B00PV6CGFA|5|My 9 month old really enjoys this!
2841233731|3|I have no complaints about the book but it was not what I expected so I returned it.<br />I just wanted recipes for baby food and it had too much other stuff.<br />Thank you
B003I8687A|4|Because we are traveling so much this summer, we wanted baby items that we could fold and pack. This is a great activity mat to that end. We have another activity mat at home but the bars are too long to fold--that's the big difference here. The bars meet at the yellow center, so they're about half the length of regular activity mat bars.<br /><br />Other reviewers are right about the twisting of the whole thing all together is a little clunky. I also don't like that the side of the mat the kiddo plays on remains out. I take it apart and fold the mat separately, hence the four stars.<br /><br />That being said, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone needing an activity gym/mat that is portable.
B002LINFZ6|5|This is a nice bedskirt.  The fabric has a nice feel and weight.  The bedskirt fits the bed nicely and looks good on the bed.  The color is great.  I had a hard time finding a color this intense and saturated.
B004J4VY2G|1|This is the first review I have ever written...but I was so disappointed I had ti share.  I was very excited about these bottles.  We tried the playtex dropin system but our baby didnt like the nipples.  When I was told these had a new drop in system I was happy to try them out.  We never got a single full bottle feed in.  Its like they just took the old bottle, added a ring and drop in and put it on the market.  We cannot get the top to seal tightly when using the drop in.  So with the least amount of pressure the top pops off and milk goes everywhere.  My husband and I have both tried everything we can to make the tops seal but its just not working.  And its too bad because our baby seems to like the nipple.  But I refuse to lose another bottle of breastmilk with this system.  How can you sell a product that doesn't close.  We even went back to the store and bought another pack of 3 (couldnt find single bottles) hoping that we just got a defective pack.  No luck.  Now I am out alomst $25 bucks and still dont have a bottle to show for it.  Tip for First Year, redesign the lids so that there is room to accommodate the rim of the drop in liner.  Playtex has figured it out...you can too.    To would be users...I would let them work out the kinks on this product before purchasing.  Right now its a waste of money.
B000AKB4IM|2|Bought for gag gift
B000KJZOWU|5|I've never slept better , thank you
B004VL2VRY|1|Let me start off by saying that when we bought this product a little less then one year ago we were extremely satisfied. We even bought an additional camera for our living room. The monitor was clear and camera easy to use. Again very happy. However, within 3 months the battery wouldn't even hold a charge longer then an hour. Within 5 months the battery wouldn't hold a charge at all-so although a hassle we would plug in monitor in whatever room we were in. Now less then a year later-no charge at all including when plugged in. Hopefully, with a battery change it will solve the problem, but from goggle searches it doesn't seem to help. I have read all the reviews regarding customer service and I'm almost afraid to call. I would recommend this product only if you don't care about blowing $300.00 like we did on monitor and additional camera that last < a year.
B00028S9Q2|5|If you are expecting a little bundle soon, this is the bassinet to buy! Very well made, easy to put together and baby is very comfortable in it. Well worth the money.
B00D0F4WEW|5|My son loves this lion. It's great for him to sleep with, no more waking up in the middle of the night because he can't find his pacifier!
B000058DM5|5|We got the Graco 3 in 1 carrier as a shower gift and as our son grew we were excited about using it around the house and on walks. Much to our dismay the carrier was uncomfortable for both our son and both parents. We returned it and tried out all the various styles of carriers available. We decided to spent the extra money and go with the Baby Bjorn. BOY ARE WE GLAD WE SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY. This carrier is very comfortable for both Mom and Dad and our son loves being able to see every thing as we walk around with him in it. I would recommend this carrier to anyone and tell them the added comfort is worth the extra cost.
B003HS5JPI|2|We bought this rattle for our 4 month old daughter. I liked that it was a high contrast rattle to help with vision development. However, the rattle is made poorly. The handle is twisted, making it hard for her to grip. We kept it since we could still hold it in front of her for play time, but I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend.
B00EDG2UA0|3|Looked nice...... but it wouldn't stick on the wall and the branches would get all tangles when you peel it off the paper backing.
B00IP8A9HI|4|Best grow with me carseat!!
B00G34TIHS|5|We bought this car seat because our baby is a sweater and in the infant seat.  We were going on a trip to Alabama in the summer and knew if she was hot, we would all be miserable.<br /><br />The first day I installed it (easy install) i was STUNNED that the &#34;lap&#34; belt is actually an upper thigh belt.  I immediately text my friend that has one and started googling just knowing i installed it wrong.  I was assured by my friend that is the way theirs fits too and google told me that it was safer than a lap belt due to internal organ damage in the event of a wreck.  Ok, I suppose I can see that...<br /><br />It took me a little while to get used to belting across the upper thighs but the baby didn't seem to care the first time or any other time.<br /><br />We have to use rolled up swaddle blankets on the sides to help keep her in the middle of the seat.  I definitely think it would be great for wider babies.  Ours is rather skinny so the swaddle blankets seem to help.
B001GQ2RWQ|5|Loved this product! It was cheaper and seemed to have ore features that worked for us than a regular high chair- portable and easy to clean.
B000046S2G|4|This chair is terrific!  We go out to eat a lot, and my 7 month old is still too small for the restaurant high chairs or booster seats - she pretty much slides right out of them.  The three point harness keeps her in the chair, and the tray keeps her from leaning too far forward, as well as giving her a focal point.  Since she can't reach beyond the tray, anything that goes on the tray can go in her mouth.<br />There are also two height adjustments and it folds well for easy carrying.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this a fifth star is how hard it is to put the tray on or take it off.
B00ETE7MI6|2|The first shipment they sent to me didn't work at all for any iOS device. They responded quick and sent out another set of cables and only 2 of those 3 worked. The products are not the greatest. I would advise buying actual Apple chargers. The customer service was good which is why I give it 2/5 stars. The products are poor.
B000JOT4DG|5|We've used it a few times already and it works great. My 8-month old seems very comfortable and secure in it, even took a nap once while shopping. It was very easy to put on the cart and fit well.
B000B74DYG|4|My husband and I also received this system for our first born.  We used it everyday, and loved being able to check on our son without walking down the hall (and risk waking him!).  With that said, just after having it 2 years the TV monitor went out.  Very annoying since we are expecting our second!  We are going to buy a new one, but we not expecting it to last for a third child, maybe we will be surprised.  Since it only lasted 2yrs I guess it cost me 20 cents a day, not too upset.  Buy it! This is totally worth it!
B003EGJT18|5|Very pleased with this purchase. High quality...I don't envision any tears or holes anytime soon. Highly recommend this brand/lunch sack.
B00AA6LQKM|5|Love it - baby uses these daily
B00EM5CPCA|5|My son received one of these in the hospital and he consistently loves this brand.
B0000DEW8N|5|Awesome product.  A wonderful alternative to a high chair that takes up a lot of room.  Dishwasher safe tray.  Height adjustments.  Can use without the tray as a booster seat.
B00O8RRMH0|5|This booster seat by Even Flo is one of the best for the price you pay. My 3 year old loves his new seat (it reminds him of Batman). It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. It shipped extremely fast too. I have bought an Evenflo booster seat for each of my kids. I highly recommend them
B000BN71GC|5|I just bought this stroller and cannot say enough about it! I have a 10 month old and an almost 3 yr. old and it holds them comfortably; the basket underneath is perfectly fine to hold a light diaper bag/purse. What I love most about this stoller is how light it is! I can get it out of my SUV with one hand and it's relatively easy to open. It moves well on smooth surfaces and I did have it at the park and it moved fine over mulch. When my youngest was born, I wanted a double stoller that was Graco carseat adaptable, so I bought the tandum Graco Duo glider-the carseat attached to the stroller with no problem and my older son could still ride in the stroller. But after switching carseats (she's now in the convertible carseat) I wanted a double stoller that was much lighter and easier to get around with. The Peg Perrego Aria double stroller is definitely the way to go. I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light, easy-to-use double stroller!
B00190JSXU|1|After one year, this stroller became very difficult to use. The wheels have become incredibly hard to steer and folding/unfolding is painful, you need both hands at all times. I'm very dissatisfied.
B00EZ6R70Q|5|BEST SOAP I HAVE EVER USED THIS IS WHY I GAVE IT 5 STARS.USE THIS SOAP IF YOU HAD ANY SKIN PROBLEMS
B000R5IC8A|5|Very pleased with service, received the bedding set quite quickly.  More than pleased with the fact that it was a new product  Thank you
B002OL1TTO|3|When starting with cloth diapers a year ago, we tried several different options- FuzziBunz, Bummis Easy fit, Bum Genius, Flip, and Econobum. We ultimately decided on Bum Genius over FuzziBunz, and those are the ones we stocked up on. Here are the negatives for the FuzziBunz<br /><br />1- fleece lining pills up and stains easily, hard to get stains out over time<br />2- he wide opening on the back of the pocket can accumulate mess, which is not pleasant when spraying! I also hate the placement of the tag- it gets poopy!  yuck!<br />3- My least favorite part of the fuzzibunz is the way it adjusts.  it's a giant pain to adjust the elastic on fuzzibunz, and then you have to let her wear it and see how it does before you can decide if it's the right setting. I found it hard to find the right setting, and the back elastic started off super tight on my tiny baby (even on the loosest settings). Snaps on other diapers are way easier for adjusting the rise.<br />4-These diapers seemed to leak overnight much more easily than my BumGenius diapers.  I stuff them with extra liners, but they always leaked around the top and the legs.  I could probably mess with the rise again for more secure leg openings...  but again, #3.  who has that kind of time to keep experimenting?<br />5- When she was younger (5 months or so) these seemed much bulkier than BG diapers.  Now as a toddler, there's really no difference.<br /><br />One advantage of the fuzzibunz is that the inserts themselves are fluffier and do not stain as easily. But I'm ok with inserts that have gotten a little dingy in the last year- a good stripping and sunning takes care of it. The Bummis easy fit was great in theory, but it does NOT have a fleece lining (BIG negative!), so it keeps wetness up against the skin (we use a fleece liner), it stains really easily and is hard to get out, it takes forever to dry, and it's a pretty small diaper! We continue to use the Flip (we just have one- I don't love it as much as the pocket system unless it's a time of day when I know she'll just be wet) and the econobums on laundry day, with our own fleece liners to keep her dry (I bought a yard of fleece and cut them myself- WAY cheaper!)<br /><br />Like I said, we prefer the BumGenius diapers by far.  We only have 1 fuzzibunz, and we use it, I just don't love it.<br />I did a ton of research and really relied on reviews in my own process, so I hope that's helpful!system unless it's a time of day when I know she'll just be wet) and the econobums on laundry day, with our own fleece liners to keep her dry (I bought a yard of fleece and cut them myself- WAY cheaper!)<br /><br />Like I said, we prefer the BumGenius diapers by far.

B001QKDI48|4|Very good & convenient to hand on a stroller or diaper bag, and convenient refills are easy to put in.
B0063A9IY0|4|My daughter loves this little toy.  She uses the net to catch her other bath toys as well!  I expected the net to it a little bit bigger for some reason.  I think I am going to buy another one to get additional water bugs.  Overall, very happy with purchase.
B001I3JR5C|3|it's a pain to cut and knot it each time it would be better if it comes with dotted lines to cut it.
B00BO1QUNK|1|I bought these to replace the straw spouts on my current Nuby bottles (which are a bear to clean!), thinking they would work. Nope! Totally the wrong shape, so I sent them back. Won't be getting Nuby bottles again!
B00RWV39ZS|5|It's a great gift!
B0031M9CL2|1|We couldnt even get the things to turn on, when you pushed the button it would turn on, then when you would let go of the button it would turn off! It literally took 10 tries to get the thing to turn on. The plastic is also very cheap and the quality of the audio was horrible!    Overall I wouldnt give it to my worst enemy.
B004DC9TD0|3|It's Huge! Takes up way too much space. Unless you have a garage for it, keep looking.
B009RLL74G|4|Thought this would fit our crib mattress, but it's too small. Fortunately it fits the mattress in the pack and play.
B007L2460U|5|My grandson loves Mickey Mouse. This lovey has ears that crackle making this very special. This made a cute Christmas gift for my 19 mo old grandson.
B0075M5H90|5|We haven't used this yet, but i did take it out of the packaging, it is so soft and comfy!! I cannot wait for our son to use this soon! This was a great deal to get, i highly recommend this item!!
B00G692Q6A|5|love it
B005C9ODSY|1|This thing is honestly a pain in the butt. It's not the easiest thing to navigate if you are a first time user. I honestly got really frustrated with it. When I did the ring sling it was so much easier and I can just slip the baby in when I already have it all on. This thing, I was just struggling with it. Even had my husband come in and help me and we were both like wtf is going on? This is even after we watched the video. The ring sling we figured it out after the first try. We had to play with this thing for a while. We ended up saying its just a P.O.S we really didn't like it at all and I honestly feel like I wasted money on this thing.
B00CR36DJU|5|I love these!  They stay on my LO's feet, and the Velcro is quite strong.  They are not too bulky, and very stylish!  I just wish they came in more colors (ie, something not white on the upper bootie).
B007KKWXFS|4|We previously purchased another crib mattress cover that was way too big.  This one has a nice snug fit - as all crib bedding should.
B007NG5UF4|5|I love the fact that you can use the monitor as a walkie talkie of sorts. I also love it that the monitor will buzz if the noise is too loud on the other end. Sometimes I don't always hear what's on the other end while sleeping, so the buzzing helps.
B001P4IBTM|5|I loved it. It looks really good in the baby's room. Not sure I will hang the three pieces on the wall, but over all I loved it!
B006T89X9Q|3|The nipple is indeed slow, the milk will not come out unless the baby does some serious sucking. However, once my baby got the handle of it, he would still chuckle with the milk as with the other nipples so not sure if it is really worth it. I also don't like that you can't see the milk coming out once he puts his mount around it, as you could with regular nipples. Not being able to see what he is eating makes it hard to tell if he is sucking too much air (it sure sounds like he is).
B00DGA06JQ|5|Best purchase ever!!! Our baby takes a nap in it every day, sleeps for 2 hours each time!
B000056J7L|5|Okay so I ordered this potty from amazon based on the reviews. I have 16 month old boy and figured why not get this started. I looked at many potty chairs and spent days reading reviews before deciding on this one. I just received it today and my son has made tinkles on it 4 times in 6 hours. He absolutely loves it, the last two times he sat there for about 10 minutes waiting to tinkle a second time. It was super easy to clean and at first impression I'm really happy!!!<br />One week later and nothing but success I love the simple design it is so easy to keep clean and the splash guard works great!!! This is an awesome product and I would recommended this to any parent trying to potty train a boy.
B002AX5IAW|5|I am so pleased with this product! Exceeded my expectations! Along with your baby pictures, you have the opportunity to journal all those milestone moments in baby's life including a little background of mommy and daddy, family tree, mommy's pregnancy, delivery, coming home, prints of baby's tiny hands and feet and many of baby's firsts, with lots of blank pages for anything else you'd like to include.  The pages are also removable, so if you want to rearrange the order or omit a few of the pre-printed pages, you can!  In the very back, you have pages for two 4x6 pics per page and plenty of space to write in descriptions and details.  This is a great gift and  a wonderful keepsake for your little one! I highly recommend this! Very tasteful!
B00DNBA82S|5|Very happy with this monitor.
B00DJPK8MS|3|This thing is a ton of fun for little ones but it sprung a leak shortly after I bought it.
B00BQMIAZ8|5|I got this for my 5 yo, she LOVES it!<br />It's very pretty colors, the clasp stays hooked, but also pops apart easily, no issues there.<br />My 3 yo also is in love with it (so I need to get her one as well) and my nearly 2 yo has been using it because she's teething! This was an all over win, good quality, very cute, easy to clean, will buy more and I highly recommend.
B0009JB3A8|5|very nice quality, super soft, great price, the boppy ones cost twice as much and same quality, my son loves to get change on this ones!!!
B0098IZEYM|5|I love Grobags! They're super cute, and very comfy for our 2 year old. They wash and dry well.
B00MRZIFL2|5|It's a great product, just like I imagined. The benefit cost balance is perfect. I recommend it.
B004B762AK|5|I love having this monitor! I got it over a year ago and it has been wonderful. I feel such a sense of security being able to see and hear my son.
B009ZU3MXS|5|Just what I needed to put over my knees when I'm on the computer.  Most are too big, etc. but this is fine and stays put.  I have to be careful when I put it down or my husband's cat is napping on it.  It has to hang over a chair and she still tries to lean on it.
B00J69XI9Q|4|Loved it. My dog can see thru and it is not a eye sore.  But if you a yorkie, it can go thru the side opening. So you have to add a board or something. Also not very practical to open. I have to slide button and lift door to open.
B000OS8BP4|5|Like any good mother to be I stocked up on all the baby necessities, including a nasal aspirator (bulb kind.)  I thought I was prepared and then came my baby's first cold.  I tried and tried, while my baby cried and cried, but the bulb nasal aspirator was worthless.  At one point I noticed a little bit of blood on the tissue after I wiped her nose.  I was heart broken thinking I had caused my baby pain.  That's when I thought...there has to be something better!  And there is....Nosefrida!!  With the first use I got so much mucous out of her nose that I shouted, \\"yeah!\\"  I have to admit, at first my baby did not like it, actually she hated it.  She still kind of bats at it when I bring it up to her face, but she's learned to accept it and no longer makes a big fuss about it.      I know this product may look bizarre at first glance, but let me tell you, when your baby is suffering from a stuffy nose you'll be glad you have it handy!
B003D3ML2Q|5|I love the dresser but it was very complicated to put together. It looks very classy and looks wonderful in the room. very heavy and seems that it will last for a very long time.
B000YLZVQS|1|Pockets threading came undone after 3 months!! It was a baby shower gift so I couldn't take it back to a store. Skip Hop would not replace or even get back to me. I emailed, called and left messages via Facebook. Terrible costumer service. Don't waste your $80. Even before it came undone nothing fit in there. Looks great from the outside, but nothing else makes it worthy of purchasing.
B005UV0UV8|3|Pros: Handy place to put the kids during dinner and housework. The playpen folds nicely.  Cons: The bassinet part does not fold or store easily. Almost impossible to clean. Graco playpen sheets don't fit. Bassinets don't have individual mattresses so can't be covered with a washable sheet. Bassinets are just the right size to attract housecats, which is a problem since they can't be stored and can't be washed.
B006P05SHY|5|Very comfy to kneel on. I was very satasified with the softness when bathing my baby. Great product. Recommend to anyone
B008BGNT4O|5|This saved our son and daughter in law as the negotiated through raising twins.  They had only one, but they could trade them off on sitting in it while caring for the other.  Two walkers might have led to collisions since they would really race around in this one.  The little boys loved it.
B000MVQBG4|1|It stays to loose that the baby take it out
B0009RNXNA|5|We had two carseats carriers. These were perfect when we got our luggage to put on our backs and go. My brother had the rolling kind, but they didn't roll very nicely. I would definitely recommend this one over a rolling one. Also, it was nice to put other items in them to check- like bigger baby blankets.
B00AU7G336|5|This bottle is 10 oz baby bottle with a soft spout. Most toddlers absolutely love this bottle because the spout is soft, yet it's not the same shape as regular baby bottle. Handles are also very comfortable to hold for the toddlers. Highly recommend this product.
B004FPYG7O|4|Exactly what I had expected. Almost would rather purchase whole new cup for price. New cup is 6.97.
B0042D69YM|5|Great high chair, easy to clean.  Love the seat recline feature for baby who is still learning to sit up.
B00JEN7XN6|5|These have been our favorite sippy cups. Very little leaking (there is a tiny lip on the nipples that allows for a small pool of liquid which can spill). Easy to put together and to clean. Our daughter has had no problems gripping and drinking from these as well.
B005ZBI03I|5|This is the perfect potty seat for a toddler. We purchased a cheap Cars themed potty seat thinking it would help our Cars-obsessed toddler get comfortable with the toilet. But it slides around and doesn't fit well into the seat. This seat is perfect - it's soft and cushiony and easy to wipe clean. My son can even put it on the toilet seat himself. It does tend to suction on the seat so I find that my son can't quite get it off. I would recommend this hands down to other seats.
B001H0GF10|5|I have a four-month-old who has been in daycare for the last six weeks.  They have Jumperoos and ExerSaucers there, and my son loves them.  He has loved them ever since he arrived there at 13 weeks old.  He is a big boy -- 95th percentile in height and 70th in weight.  I wanted to get him something similar at home, but most toys have 25lb or 30in restrictions.  My son will grow physically out of most toys before he cognitively does.  This ExerSaucer grows with the baby, so I am hoping that he will enjoy it for a long time (even though he's already at the second height setting even though we just cracked it out of the box).<br /><br />This ExerSaucer was not fun to put together, but I got there in the end.  Before I even attached the toys to it, I placed my son in the seat.  He liked it right away.  Once I attached the toys, it was all over!  He stayed in it for the longest time.  There is so much to swat at, grab, spin, light up.  He just loves it!
B00DYOQMBU|5|I have three boys ages four and under, all of whom loved these. They accepted the &#34;Soothie&#34; brand until around  three months,and then all three never accepted any other pacifiers except MAM. There's something about the soft texture on the nipple itself - this might sound weird, but I feel like out of all the pacifiers I tried, the MAM pacis are the only ones with a skin-like texture. My boys were all exclusively breastfed, so I'm guessing that's why they liked these pacis - they are the most similar to an actual human nipple. Also, their widening shape allows the babies to hold the pacifier more easily in their mouth even as they drift off to sleep. The Soothies would always fall out, but they are able to hold on to the MAM so much easier. I could not more highly recommend this product. They seem like one of the more expensive brands, but even with our single income budget, we make sure we have a good stock of these for our little ones.
B00CXTWJAA|5|Makes pumping and feeding a breeze. Absolutely love these
B0042D69WY|5|I bought this for my newborn niece and she loves it.  It was easy to put together and she loves watching the mobile while she rocks.  it's a great place to put her when I need my hands free.  She likes the sounds and the different rocking options are great for us to keep an eye on her wherever we are.
B008B349RS|5|Grand daughter loves it for her baby.
B001S5E0RU|5|Cloud B Gentle Giraffe Sound Machine is a wonderful product!  Its' soothing sounds really help my newborn sleep every night!  SO glad I purchased this adorable giraffe!
B00CKBKTOY|5|A perfect crib and a great price! The pieces are not marked with numbers or letters so it was a little confusing to put together, other than that, it's perfect!
B0077M41Z4|5|These are awesome!  It makes cleaning all of my son's cups so easy!  I wish I had known about them before, I now tell EVERYONE with kids to get these!!
B00P21F4T4|5|I love this pillow! It's not hard or bulky, perfectly soft and sized for little toddler heads!
B00346L470|4|I had purchased lots of type/brands, but this is so far the best sippy cup of them all, I had a few of the similar type, but the inside of it keeps breaking on us (when our daughter drops the sippy cup on the floor), but this one is much durable, OR, maybe our daughter just don't drop it as much, anymore.  It does leak out depending on what type of drinks you have, but I can live with that, as long as I loosen the lid for a while, when she is not drinking it.  It does the same leaking with other sippy cups, so I can't really complain about that issue, but overall, this one is the sturdiest and easy to clean, too!
B0007KMUH4|5|I did not want a bulky, heavy travel system, so when I read about the Snap 'n Go in Baby Bargains, I knew that was the product for me.  I registered for the Graco Snug Ride, and then Graco came out with their own infant carrier stroller, so I traded in the Snap 'n Go.  Could not be happier with it.  Large basket, and cup holder are well used.  Plus, it's so easy to open and close.  Well worth every penny!
B0009RNXNA|1|Didnt fit my graco all in one . Dissappinted
B00005BSXI|3|Like many other reviews listed, I too loved being able to watch and hear my daughter while she slept.  The night vision was great until the darned thing stopped working.  At first it just flickered from time to time, then the video portion stopped working altogether.  My husband and I would have to stand there for sometimes 10 mins switching channels and messing with it to get a picture.  Then it would go off again, then on again, just a headache.  For $150 bucks you think it would last more than a few months.  What a disappointment.
B000056JHN|3|People think when they buy this that they'll hear the heartbeat like in the Dr.'s office, but this device is nothing more than an amplified stethoscope.  The baby has to be in the right position and not moving as much for it to work the best.  I am a nurse and was able to hear my baby's heartbeat, but with a little practice, it can be easy for anyone.  Just don't expect to hear the gallops of the Dr's doppler at the office, instead listen for the lub-dub heart sound,as you would if you put it to your own chest.  Also the older the baby, the better you'll hear, I really didn't pick up my baby's heart until after 23 weeks.  Give it a chance, it's pretty cool!
B00GQZP8CS|3|They are very cute I just thought They were leggings not leg warmers.  But still like them good quality
B002EEO68W|5|Excellent
B000F1OGCC|3|We bought this on the recommendation of a major 'baby' store in our area.  \\"Baby\\" is in their name...anyhow, they assured us it would be fine for our crib converted to daybed/toddler bed and that we wouldn't need to worry that there was no box spring to secure the rail to.      That is true, it attaches well, it's secure, totally tight against the mattress.  The are other problems though and we can't wait to get our daughter a regular twin bed so that we can use this rail and be happier with our purchase.  Read on...    1.   The rail is very long, great to keep our baby in her bed, but our daughter only has a 10 inch opening to use to get in and out of her bed.  I guess it's sufficient, but it's a little tight for her getting in and out.      2.    The rail is very tall.  Again, great for keeping our little one in the bed, but bad design functionally.  If we put the mattress/frame up high enough for it to fold down flat (it won't clear the floor because of the height of the rail) then there will be a 4 inch gap between the frame and the daybed rail which poses a risk for our daughter.       We have to put up with not having the rail fold down.  Bedtime routine is very hard now, and we have to get our daughter ready for bed elsewhere since her bed is too hard to stand over and kneeling at the side of it is a joke with the 10 inch opening, I can't even get my head and 1 arm through.    3.   We had to move the mattress up a level so that the frame was slightly above the daybed rail, so that the very thick hinge (which serves to purpose for us since we can't fold the rail down) didn't put stress on the frame of the bed itself by resting against the daybed rail.   This defeats the purpose of the \\"toddler bed\\" setting and with only a 10 inch opening, it's an even more precarious a climb for our little one.    Lastly, the directions are ambiguous (at best) and the lack photo's makes putting it together a little challenging, which is why the manufacturer tells the consumerto \\"take a deep breath\\" as step one.    All in all, a great rail for a regular bed, a terrible one for crib to toddler bed/daybed.  If you are looking to increase the life of your crib with a rail, look elsewhere, this product will likely either go back or make you move to a regular full twin or other larger bed.    Note we have the durel crib/toddler bed/daybed.  It was inexpensive, so maybe that contributes to some of our problems.
B008KW8IP4|4|We wanted something for our daughter that would be sturdy for a few years with the realistic expectation that it may not last forever.  I would say that this chair fit the bill, and the price was fantastic. I don't think that the durability will be a problem based on our first few months with it in use.  Recommended.
B00B7M7BN4|5|THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL WORKS 100% AS GOOD AS ANY OTHERS AND 1/2 THE PRICE SO I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS!
B008J0DEAG|4|The bag is really nice and very well thought out. I haven't had it long enough to say for certain that its definitively worth the price though.
B00WG9MX0S|3|Love the style. It's as described, there is a slight smell and the color varied slightly, but I really like the purse. I typically buy fossil or similar purses, so this one is different in quality (i.e. The inside lining is stiff and not that attractive) but for the price, it's good. Again, love this style and was just what I was looking for.
B0011URFRE|5|our boy likes this seat a lot. the only down side is it is heavy. but we got two, one for each car so we wouldn't have to take it in and out of the car all the time.
B003IPSDM6|5|Thx i like the stuff that i just ordered it was perfect with good quality n the service was amazing n it arrived at the exactly time thx a lot
B0016ZZ20Q|5|I bought this product for my 6 year old. This is super easy to use. Great for families on the go.  Immediately seen results. I have tried wrapping thumb with tape and gauze, putting something on his nail to make it taste bad,overall this was the least expensive and most effective, plus my son loves wearing it.I bought it in his favorite color.
B000YDDF6O|5|Baby and adults enjoy this together. It gives my baby a big smile when the tune starts. He learned how to work it. I would buy this again for friends' babies. His aunt also wants one as it's so easy to operate and gives her something to relax with. Good product.
B00C78CILM|5|The loops are great to attach those little rings with toys on them. Extremely convenient for running around town. Throw it in your diaper bag!
B00906X9ZI|5|Thank you
B001WAJVZM|5|The Moby bath spout cover is much better looking than other too-cutesy covers, but it's also very functional ... easy to install and adjust for a perfect, snug fit. The shower lift and faucet work/flow perfectly with it in place, while my little guy is protected from bumping his head.
B006PB2FX8|5|Compact and stylish. Love that the tray is dishwasher safe! Folds so it takes up very little room when not in use.
B0052IERHM|5|This thing is great (so far), I've used it on 2 flights. I have a Britax Marathon, and it fit perfect in the upright position. Easy to get in, and there is actually enough room in the 'seat' of the carseat so stick even more stuff! So on the way back, we stuck one of our soft carryons in there so we didn't have to pack it around. One flight I gate checked it, 2nd flight I checked it as baggage. Both times it came through in one piece, yahoo!
B00NFY534Q|5|Wonderful bibs...very absorbent and cute. I just wish there were more colors/choices/some solids, especially for girls.
B003HS5JMQ|5|This item is so cute and great quality. It is perfect for my 2 year old to carry her \\"stuff\\" in: Coloring books, crayons, sippy cup. It is the perfect size and something she will grow with for several years. Love this item. My only problem was trying to pick which animal design to get. They are all so cute.
B004C053AQ|3|I bought this bottle in the hopes that my breastfed baby would latch, since he rejected every nipple I tried. Unfortunately, this nipple is too long and gagged him. I will say that it is a very cool bottle, with the silicone body. However it didn't work for me. I did eventually find success with the Lansinoh Momma bottle--that one I'd highly recommend, and the Momma nipples can be used in Avent bottles. Good luck finding the bottle that works for you!
B005KODTX6|5|I was very happy with this car seat when I started using it. It was easy to assemble and fits perfectly in my compact car. The covers detach easily for washing after messes are made. The cup holders are flexible and hold all shapes and sizes of snack and drink containers. We have a very happy munchkin in his new big boy seat.
B001GIOPH4|5|I bought this for a friends baby shower. She loved the color of the cover. Very neutral and not gender specific
B007NG5UGS|5|I love this product.
B00400NY9A|1|We have had about 4 monitors between our kids. This is the current one that we bought after some how misplacing the previous portable unit.  This has the worst reception ever! we have a split level and the monitors sit about 25'  from each other and up about 6 stairs. I have tried all the outlets in my room and babies room. I have to actually rest the listening piece ontop of my bed side lamp in order to reduce the static enough to sleep. the other issue is that the volume does not turn down to only use lights. Turned all the way down it still picks up baby at a hiugh enough volume that we never actually turn the volume above lowest setting. This sucks when the baby is fighting sleep or nap raining and you can not turn volume down and watch the lights. Instead you have to sit and listen to at loud volume.
B002ABMSCU|4|We put these up in the corners of my kids' rooms to hold all of the stuffed animals that were previously all over the floor with no real home. Its works perfectly for that job!
B00FLXBNOS|5|This review is for the Navigator as a double stroller:<br /><br />My kids are 4 months and 2 years old. Before the little one was born, I did not really want to buy a double stroller because I already found the single one I had too big. But once he was there, I knew I needed a double because I walk a lot with both kids. I ordered a side-by-side one first, but it did not fit in the elevator in our building. Therefore I returned it and bought this one instead and I love it! It is actually smaller than the single one I had for my daughter. It is easy to navigate and I like that it has a hand brake because foot brakes tend to ruin your shoes. I also love that you can convert one of the seats into a bassinet. We have used it this way most of the time so far.<br /><br />There are a couple of things that I do NOT love about the stroller:<br />- It is quite heavy. I usually let my husband put it in the car. BUT if they used lighter material, the stroller would probably be much more expensive.<br />- I used to hang my diaper bag on the handle bar of my old stroller. You cannot really do that with this one because the bag will be in your baby's face or at least block his view.<br />- There is not much room in the basket, especially when using it with two seats.<br />BUT the last two issues just come with a double stroller that is the size of a single.<br />So all in all I am super happy with this stroller and I gave it five stars because there is no other double stroller on the market that is as small and inexpensive as this one.<br /><br />Here are a couple of things we found out after we bought the stroller that can save you some money:<br />- The second seat is already included. So you don't have to buy an extra seat.<br />- We were going to buy the Phil&Teds cocoon for our newborn to put him in the bassinet. But when we got the stroller we realized that we would not need it. So we ended up not buying it.
B004SCND1E|3|I got this for my baby daughter to help her sleep.<br />The material is soft and smooth, however it sheds like crazy and after a few weeks there is a hole in the nose. This is unlike the quality of GUND. So I am returning this and getting a different one. Hopefully, it will not disappoint again.
B0096DG8LW|5|shipped fast, product as described.
B00SA5XNN8|5|Awesome bibs! I should have bought these sooner. They stay put, function and wash up well.
B00G93JMGU|5|This food tray is incredibly easy to use. I love that the material is so flexible, allowing me to easily pop the frozen food out without having to tap the tray against the counter (like you have to do with plastic trays). The lid is an added bonus, as well.
B0077M41Z4|1|The brush was too loose in my smoothie straws, so it was completely ineffective. I struggled to judge if it would work or not when I considered ordering it, did not work.
B00A6F2QJC|4|Good product that does a good job getting bottles and pump parts clean, no smell to it at all which is nice, we used several bottles of this before we switched to regular dish soap due to the cost of this product, besides being expensive it is a great product to use!!
B004J34TF6|5|It's as good as used be.
B00HMELOBQ|5|I purchased this lambs and ivy yoo hoo bedding setting for my first born's nursery and it has been literally everything I could ask for in bedding!  While I am having a son, I find the color hues of green, teal, white, yellow, aqua, and orange to be very gender neutral and extremely easy to match decorating.  The colors look just like the advertised picture (I included pics as well).  I machine washed and dried all 5 pieces, and they all held up great!  No stray threads or loss of color at all (I even washed some pieces in warm water to get them as clean as possible).  The set is fairly soft as well (as soft as threaded cotton gets, it's not flannel but I think it feels great).<br /><br />The blanket itself has two hidden gems that should be included in the description: a rattler and a squeaker in elephant!  I love the attention to detail on all pieces, but especially how every part of the blanket is sewn down - I can't find any choking or other health hazards.<br /><br />The fitted crib sheet has very deep pockets that fit well over my dream on me infant/toddler mattress.  It hugs the mattress well and doesn't slide when pulled on - again I feel it's very safe.<br /><br />The bumpers are very thick and well made.  Due to SIDS safety concerns, I won't actually use them until my son is a bit older, but they are great quality and hold up to the rails very well.  The ties are fairly long, so you can tie it in place pretty easily, just takes some time because there are so many ties (but it holds all pieces of the bumpers securely in place).  Again, awesome quality and colors.<br /><br />The diaper stacker is a nice pairing for decoration.  There is a cardboard insert that keeps the bottom of the diaper holder level (remove before washing!), which seems like it won't last long, but I really just plan on using this piece as decoration anyways.  I've talked to other parents, and it seems like this is just part of bedding packages.<br /><br />The dust ruffle is a mesh whiterectangle that goes under the mattress, enclosed on all four sides with matching yoo hoo fabric.  There are slits on all four sides to slide over the crib bottom.  This ruffle is the perfect length, and won't touch the floor even when I drop my crib down toddler level.  It held up great in the wash, which I was very concerned about with the mesh center part.<br /><br />The bonus free sheet saver is a very soft, multiple layer white cotton rectangle that is about the right size to change an infant on.  It's not huge, and won't protect the entire crib, but has four sets of ties, one at each corner, so that you can tie it into place and use it for changing or setting down a baby.  The idea is to get it dirty, so you only have to wash it and not your sheets.  I plan to use it over my separate changing pad.<br /><br />Overall, I have no complaints at all about this bedding set.  Not only does it seem to wash extremely well, but all the parts seem well thought out and safe, as well as very cute.  I like the set so much, I ended up getting some matching pieces from lambs and ivy, which made setting up a well coordinating nursery super easy.  Five stars, I highly recommend!
B004EWG4ZA|5|My son really enjoys sleeping in his crib with this new crib mattress. It is very comfortable for him and was a great purchase!
B000WYJ2Y4|5|I purchased this desk for my son when he was between 12 - 15 months old.  The desk is stylish and fits well in small spaces.  Cleans up very easily.  The chair material is slippery so it was tough for my son to stay on the seat.  I was able to fix that easily by attaching the thin, rubbery material used to line cabinets.  That did the trick!  My son is now 2 and can sit on the chair sans the liner material.  He loves the desk!
B00BUAL4JU|5|Very cute pattern. Works great for containing my cloth diapers. Washes up great. So far has been completely leak proof.
B00LZKBKVM|5|If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would.  My 4-month baby loves to suck on things, and whenever we are out and she is in the carrier, she is just going to town on the teething cover!  She never gets sick of it!
B00F2MQ258|1|No good!
B002O085DI|5|My grandson just loves this taggies blanket - wish that you would carry it again so I can purchase as a baby shower gift.
B0050GD2EK|4|This tray is useful but makes the stroller much larger when folded. My 13 month  old also has to pull herself up to reach her snacks on the tray as it sticks far out. It is OK but there really isnt an alternative option.
B00ATYHGJ0|1|These is suppose to fit 3-5 CDs?<br />no... it fits 1-2 at most... VERY disappointed.
B003U5TLMU|4|Son was born 7 lb 10 oz and he was able to wear this diaper until he was a little over two months and 14 lbs. Easy to use the insert designed to come out of the pocket for washing worked well. I always used the extra insert for asborbancy.
B001DF67GC|2|I wanted to like these seat protectors because of the price; however, I was back at Amazon buying the more expensive version two months after purchasing these for my van.  The mats do not protect the sides of the seats very well, but they also aren't very sturdy.  After only a couple of weeks, the seat protector started to bend in at the top so that the bar on the back of the seat was exposed on either side.  This was problematic because my three-year-old likes to rest his feet on this bar, and this was one of the reasons I needed a seat protector!  Also, the only thing keeping this on the seat was a strip of velcro that goes around the headrest of the seat, which also started to loosen with ordinary wear.  My kids and I are not hard on our possessions -- this product is just not made very well.  It's true that you get what you pay for.  I bought a more expensive version (made by Rover), and I am SO happy with that one.
B0011URFRE|1|I HATE this seat. We had a Britax that was damaged in a car accident and we had to get a replacement asap. However, this seat has caused more safety issues with me distracted at how my little girl head continually flops forward every time she goes to sleep. I have tried EVERYTHING to keep her head from flopping forward, including ordering a $40 special head support and putting things under the seat in an attempt to tilt it so it would not happen. Nothing worked. This was NEVER an issue with the Britax. This is the WORST SEAT EVER MADE. It makes me so mad every time I get in the car. I feel like BURNING IT! Don't waste your money!
B000HEG7FQ|5|You'll love this product..it delivers the promise and they are so soft..my baby loves them..yours will too.
B004EBUXC6|5|Was sick of pulling out the carseat my daughter uses for my granddaughter everytime I wanted to take her out, so I bought a seat for my car.  The juvenile highback is perfect.  My granddaughter loves the seat, it's easy to use, and looks great.  I had no trouble getting it nice and tight in the backseat with the anchor attached.  The straps are easy to adjust and I know she'll use the seat for a long time - now as a car seat and later as a booster.  Price was rigth too!
B002TR7Q9U|5|My 4-month baby loves these links; they are her favorite toys! I disagree with a previous reviewer who called them 'cheap'. They are lightweight, but that is perfect for my little baby, who is starting to teeth but can't hold up most teething toys because they are too heavy. She loves to nibble on her links. And when she was first starting to grip things in her hands, these links were the easiest things for her to hold. I will be buying more for my baby and for friends' babies.
B0000D9SR8|5|I've tried several different bathing items for my 10 month old. This seat is great. Even for a baby that is on the lighter and shorter side. Our daughter is only in the 25th % for growth and a little less for weight. I was hesitant abou this product at first because I heard someone say it floats, when they were returning it at a store? I don't even know how that's possible now that I have tried it. As long as your child can sit up, it's a great investment. <br />I'm also a daycare provider and I talk with parents about items they buy. This one has been tops!
B000GE9XIA|3|This gate is great for its price. We did end up attaching it to a couple 2x4's so that we didn't have to reck the wood on the stairs.  The gate does what we need it too, however just know that you will need to drill holes in wall/stairs!
B004I8VDSI|5|I selected this 4 piece bedding set at BabiesRUs and got it for my baby shower. Additionally purchased the curtains, wall decals and one more sheet. It is well made is practical and looks great. The colors are easy to match. This set does not look too baby-ish, so it will last for several years.
B00D3MPRDC|5|I love this case!  Have had no problems with it!  Leather is of good quality to.  Highly recommended!
B005GU181Y|2|Ugh... awful. The tray DOES NOT STAY ON!!!!!! It just lays there and my daughter constantly throws it off and cries. We gave this away to community center.
B001IXYOD2|5|Love these bottles but there are A LOT of parts to clean. Also writing is hard to see the measurements. we marked it with a sharpie. Cleaning is painful but my son loves these bottles.
B0070ZY80Q|5|These are cheap insurance for any small electric devices that you carry.  I have one on my pedometer and also use one on my golf GPS unit.  Having the extras is great and the price can't be beat.
B003VNKLIY|3|I bought this since I have a large opening I want to keep my baby from entering. This works very well but it wasn't built to last it seems since pieces can be taken apart that shouldn't. Great idea but build needs improvement.
B001NXC3PI|4|I purchased this exact same high chair with a navy (reversible) cover in 2005. My grandkids all have cycled through it at my house ever since then. It is holding up quit nicely. I remove the fabric cover and wash it in my front loading washing machine, and let it air dry after every visit.It is easy to remove, and washes nicely. I store in in the corner between the hutch and wall, and it folds to about 12 inches wide; with the foot rest folded in the up position,excluding the tray.If you choose to hang the tray off the back it is a little wider. (about the width of the tray). The height adjusts to different levels so if you wanted to, you could push it up to your table without the tray. There is also vinyl padding attached to the seat under the fabric pad for a softer seat. It has several recline positions, and a 5-point harness. Wheels have a locking position. Cons: The tray seems a little high for the baby. My 10 month-old grandson is average in size, and it comes up to his chest.Tray removal handle is positioned in the front instead of on each side. This may only be my problem since I was used to removing previous trays by their sides.The tray has a removable top layer for easy cleaning, but it is still too big to fit my dishwasher.
B0038JE5Y2|4|I have used this for freezing breastmilk and have had no problems. Easy to fill, freeze, empty, and clean. I do have a level spot reserved in my freezer for my trays so I don't have to worry about spilling. I use this tray and the Fresh Baby tray and love them both. Fresh Baby trays take up a little less room if space is an issue for you. I usually don't leave the cubes in the tray for more than a couple of days so haven't had problem with freezer burn. Try taking them out of tray and storing in freezer bags long term to prevent this issue.
B00EHKHVKG|4|Exactly as described
B002MY3HBQ|5|Actually started using this for big ice cubes, but gave it to my daughter for her baby.  Works great.  Love the top.
B00CWEXIL0|5|Love this stroller! We were debating between a jogger (BOB Revolution) and this Britax. Chose the Britax and am very satisfied. I like that 1) our car seat fits (Britax B Safe - awesome car seat). 2) The stroller rolls really well (on both solid and grassy surfaces)... Its quite effortless to push. 3) The Britax is super easy to fold and unfold. Once folded it doesnt take up too much space (I drive a 2011 subaru outback and we can easily fit 2 sets of golf clubs and the stroller easily in the back without folding down seats). 4) It isn't too heavy. I can easily lift it in and out of my car.<br /><br />We thought we might purchase a jogger next year once our daughter is a year old.<br /><br />One comment my husband made is the handle used to push the stroller seems a little low for him (he's 6'7&#34;). I'm 5'5&#34; and have no issues. Handle is at a very comfortable height for me.
B00LCWA08W|1|They suck. They ball up and don't even protect my seats.
B004PKNRMY|1|Unfortunately, I've learned too late that this company is a bunch of scam artists. Their products are very cheaply made and their methods of making money are based off of charging high shipping and handling prices on their \\"free\\" product (should you come across one of their many \\"promo codes\\"), making you think you're getting a good deal. If that isn't bad enough, they are also known for selling your credit card and contact information to other parties. Don't bother with these people! You are much better off spending a little extra for a better quality carrier or, as another person had mentioned, checking out the used ones as they are a dime a dozen.
B001874FF0|3|I have had no problems with this crib.  I like how it is sturdy and well built.  One issue that recently came up, however, was the design of the front part.  See the gap between the top of the front (the bar) and the slats?  It's just an aesthetic feature.  Well, this became a problem for us when my son was around 20 mos (about 2 1/2 feet tall).  He realized he can stick his foot in between and use that to hoist himself up and over the front.  He literally climbed out of his crib!  Twice!!!  So while this design looks innocuous enough, it's actually a flaw.  Had there been no space there, he would've hard a harder time raising his leg in order to put his foot up the top bar.
B002BSHTSU|4|This has kept my daughter pretty entertained for the past couple of months.  I started using it when she was 3 mths (she's 6 mths now).  It's cute - a tad bit tacky neon pink - but overall a cute item.  She enjoys watching it.  I did find that the \\"low volume\\" is way too low - and the high volume is REALLY loud.  I wish there was a volume in between!  She will not fall asleep to this - we use this for play, not a sleep prop.  I would recommend it, but I'm not raving about it either.
B00YAYMYRE|5|I bought these for my 7 month old baby for the 4th of July. We shot off a ton of fireworks and she slept through it all while wearing these. These should fit her for a long time so we will use them.
B00URNO4GG|5|Great! We used these for a photo shoot. They look great!<br />They are however a little big for a newborn and hard for them to hold onto. I would recommend for a 6 month + baby.
B000096QDC|2|We got one of these and within 6 hours of being in our car window, it melted under the summer sun.  We got a magnet one, which sticks to the outside of the car, does not obstruct your view and can stand the hot New Mexico sun.
B00II6QO8A|5|Great product. Product and hardware arrived with no issues. Would buy from again.
B0082I1IA8|5|My son loves only this Brand. And it's easy to find them at night..
B00D9CE2AK|1|This carrier is ridiculous for a twin mom to deal with. First of all, the price is despicable, c'mon, we are already paying and dealing with TWO babies, do you really need to take advantage and charge $140?! I bought an excellent carrier for my singleton for under $20 & it's amazing. This rubix cube of a carrier is way over priced. Obviously, I'm willing to pay the price for something to make my life more convenient, but this thing leaves me frustrated and in a sweat by the time it's on.<br /><br />Who designed this thing? Have you ever dealt with twins? When you have two screaming at the top of their lungs to be carried, you do not want to deal with THAT MANY STRAPS AND BUCKLES! It's the most confusing piece of baby equipment I've ever had, and I own a lot of it! Everything becomes entangled, you don't know what goes where, unbelievable.<br /><br />Once you do solve the mystery of getting it on and the babies in, straps tightened, you realize your babies are slipping a good 6&#34; away from you! The straps will not stay tight and become lose leaving your babies bent backwards away from you in a very dangerous position. I have to use binder clips to hold it tight. Unbelievable.<br /><br />Let's talk about doing something when the carrier is on. Oh wait, you can't, there are babies in your way. Your arms can only go out to your sides. No folding laundry, no playing with an older child, just standing or sitting is all that's permitted.<br /><br />I am so disappointed in this carrier. Someone please make a comfortable carrier, easy to use, and safe. Twin mom's have it tough as it is, this is just an extra thing to waste money on and frustrate you. DO NOT BUY TWIN MOM'S!
B001BRBODS|1|Hi,    Our son turned 4 weeks old today; Two hours ago, he was also a split second away from suffering serious injury.    I persuaded my wife to purchase the new Ergo Sport and Baby Insert based on the excellent reviews the ergo carrier had received. I went ahead with the purchase even after trying this exact setup (sport with insert) on at a baby expo in Brisbane/Australia and thinking to myself how difficult/awkward it was to leverage. The reviews stated it was the best, and that was all that counted. We want the best for our boy, so we'll get used to it.    The instructions bundled with the infant insert leave a lot to be desired; only just now have we realized that the ergo baby website carries an instructional support video that shows two different variations to using the insert (the latter matching the pdf/printed documentation).    With much frustration in trying to leverage the ergo with insert without assistance from a second person, my wife turned to google and from there a link to youtube to watch a 5 star ratged video titled \\"How to use the Infant Insert of the Ergo Baby Carrier\\" by user \\"bellybeyondnz\\";     We followed these instructions blindly, assuming that this was the correct procedure. The video shows a women first laying a baby on to the insert, then wrapping it around him, and lifting the swaddled baby in to position inside a partially assembled carrier, and then raising shoulder straps etc.  Note, the instructional video on the ergo website (first variation) leverages this style of approach where baby is first wrapped/swaddled and then inserted into carrier.    I'm 6'4 tall.  To cut a horrible story short, standing with carrier semi assembled, I effectively dropped my son wrapped in the insert whilst awkwardly trying to put him in to the carrier; Through luck/reflexes, I managed to catch him about a foot from the ground. He still screamed like we have not heard before, and we hope no damage has been done.    Please, please, please try this device and insert out thoroughly at a store before purchasing and make your own mind up whether this setup is suitable for a new born. Don't accept reviews alone. Make sure if you do purchase, that you view the instructional video on the ergo website before use.    I'm sure once my son reaches 15 pounds and can use the ergo without need for the infant insert, this will be a great carrier.  But i'm certainly not sold on the infant insert. I have doubts the ergo was ever designed with newborn in mind. Maybe it is because our son is quite tall (61 cm / 2 feet ?).    Update: My wife has since tried the Baby Bjorn (Baby Carrier Original) out on our son. Its feels more secure for the newborn, but leaves them sitting completely upright with neck essentially taking full load of the head weight. Our boy will not fall asleep in such a position - but will in a more side-style position of the ergo. We are going to persist with the ergo, but be extremely careful and do everything sitting down.
B000F1O8T8|5|This seat is great for what it is designed to do, which is occasional use when out of the house. Much sturdier, and more comfortable than any other folding seat we have used. If used correctly (all the way back on the toilet) the back will not collapse.
B0002XO5M4|4|My husband and I wanted to buy on of these so bad, but kept putting it off.  We went on vacation and borrowed our friends and absoutley loved it.  Our son was so comfortable and secure in the carrier.  Now he's too big for it, but for the next baby if we get one, this will be the ticket.  We can't afford to spend $100.00 on a carrier, but since this one worked perfectly why should we.  If you are watching your penney's and want a great carrier for this price, I highly recomend this one!
B000OZH36U|3|I bought the Peanut Shell when my son was 6 weeks old. He was a very fussy baby and this dramatically reduced his fussiness and my stress level. I loved that I could easily fold it and tuck it into the diaper bag. It is easy to use and not overly hot due to excess material. I used it for him in the chest-to-chest carry, kangaroo carry, and hip carry. I clean houses for a living and take him with me so it's very important that I could carry him at times but also have him out of the way.     My baby loved to sleep in the sling and he always seemed comfortable. I never had a problem getting it off and keeping him asleep. I would just hold him under his legs/bum with one arm and use the other arm to slip the sling over my head and lay him down on a bed.     On the downside...I thought the price was a little steep for a loop of fabric!!!    My son is now 5 1/2 months and 17 lbs. He seems to be inbetween the size where he fits completely in the sling and where he sits with his bum in the sling and his legs hanging out. I always felt like he wasn't very safe when I tried it with his legs out. And I definatly wasn't comfortable with putting him on my back.     Additionally, although it does a pretty good job of distributing his weight by the time I take him out I usually feel out of whack. In the hip carry the weight pulls on one shoulder and pushes in on the opposite hip. Another thing that was difficult is that with my job I do a lot of reaching and the sling seemed to limit mobility on the side that it hung from.     I loved that it was so simple but at the same time I struggled a bit to get it just right. It always felt like he was hanging a bit low and maybe this contribute to me be sore after a while.     Conclusively, I loved the sling for a while but now that my son is older/bigger I've moved onto the Ergo Baby Carrier. I will definatley be hanging onto the Peanut Shell for my next baby though!!! Maybe I can have my son on my back and another baby in the Peanut Shell on the front. That'll turn some heads!!!!
B004VSM8NY|2|I had high hopes for this bib but it faded quickly, the magnets are not strong enough so my 4 month old pulls it apart and the idea of '4' sides to use is not practical with a baby that spits up as much as mine. Maybe for someone that jut has a child that drools a little it would work.
B004G8QSYO|5|My 9 month twin girls both love these.
B00H07AXY4|5|I do not write reviews ever. These were so fantastic and exceeded my expectation. Worth every penny. I use this and one cheap microfiber insert and he can go the entire night.
B00W1YI866|5|These are fabulous pants for the Spring and Summer. Great fit. No wonder they are sold out.
B00KHR7M1Q|5|Love it
B009FNYSLU|5|I bought these for a friend who had a little boy and they are absolutely adorable. They are stylish and look way better than the standard bibs.
B004FPYFWA|5|With our first baby, we carried a small suitcase (essentially!) and everything but the kitchen sink. These days, with four kiddos in tow, I need my arms and strength for more important things besides hefting an unnecessarily huge and heavy bag with me, like keeping my three year old from feeding the baby nuts or running into the street. (I can spot a new parent a mile away by their huge, fancy diaper bag...)<br /><br />I thoroughly examined, held and even purchased some of the following: JuJu Be, Petunia Picklebottom, Skip Hop Duo, and one more I can't even remember. And guess what? If I had a million dollars to spend on diaper bags, I'd still buy this slim little JJ Cole beauty. Why? Here are a few reasons:<br /><br />++Pockets galore! Inside and outside with lovely light liner inside to help make things visible. I never lose my keys now!! (Important because while I'm looking for my keys, my darling three year old is trying to find a stick to scratch the next car over.)<br /><br />++Several choices for handle straps (length and location)<br /><br />++Awesome, slim, easily foldable with velcro changing pad. I actually use it because it's not like wrestling an octopus to get it back in the bag neatly (and I feel as though I can speak with authority about wrestling many arms at a time...)<br /><br />++The metal feet on the bottom...I don't know why I like these, but I do.<br /><br />++Stroller clips - GENIUS! Easy to put on my stroller, easy to attach to my diaper bag (easier than the skip hop, juju be clips)<br /><br />++The size. I looked for a long time to find the smallest diaper bag (I really read all the dimensions on the bags to make sure I wasn't getting a small piece of luggage) and this is slightly bigger than a big purse, but still smaller than any other diaper bag out there. It's like a Mary Poppins bag because I can fit everything I need, but it's a sleek little size.<br /><br />In short, I adore this bag and I'm a diaper bag veteran and I really shoppedaround this time, but this is hands down the best for a fraction of the cost of many fancier bags out there.
B0018CMVME|5|I was really wary when I read the reviews before buying this seat, because people had mentioned lack of cushioning, and difficulty of adjusting the straps.  But this car seat was so much cheaper than everything else out there, I got it anyway - and I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />As for lack of cushioning, maybe it has less than other models out there, but it's plenty for my little one.  Also, it makes for very easy clean-up.  Face it, at some point or other, your kid is going to throw up ALL OVER the car seat (or worse, diarrhea).  When that happens, you'll be so happy you bought this car seat because it is very easy to just pull off the cover and throw it in the washing machine, and all that's left to do is wipe off the plastic base.<br /><br />As for the difficulty adjusting the straps, I'm not sure what other reviewers were referring to.  I have had no problems at all in pushing the little button to loosen them or pull them tight, which we do every time we get in or out.  The safest way to use a car seat is to pull the straps so tight that you have to loosen them just to get them off (but not so tight that your baby is noticeably uncomfortable).<br /><br />My favorite feature about this car seat is the safety rating.  As an educated parent, I worry every time we get in the car because I know how dangerous it is to be on the road.  With this car seat, I worry just a little bit less.<br /><br />My second favorite feature about this car seat is the view.  This is probably a feature of every convertible seat as contrasted with an infant seat, but I wish I had started with a convertible and skipped the infant seat altogether (especially since we are baby-wearers and rarely took the infant seat out of the car anyway).  Once we got our baby into a convertible (she grew out of her infant seat), she could suddenly see out not only the back window, but the sides as well, and she could even turn her head to see the driver.  Car rides suddenly became a lot more bearable.<br /><br />My one gripe with this car seat is the cup holder.  We hadn't even used it yet when the little plastic piece that holds it on snapped in two.  So if you really need a reliable cup holder, this car seat is not for you.is the cup holder.  We hadn't even used it yet when the little plastic piece that holds it on snapped in two.  So if you really need a reliable cup holder, this car seat is not for you.
B004GJXM0G|4|Thus mattress pad does what it's supposed to.  It protects the mattress from pee.  We machine wash but hang dry to preserve the life of the waterproof qualities.
B004A9PWHS|3|It's decent for the price
B0078LM4BW|5|Great quality
B006SFUEFM|5|I got these for Christmas and love them, so I bought another pair for my other stroller!  I broke a few plastic hooks recently, when my bag got caught on something and pulled the hook too hard or when the weight was too much with me pulling the straps out to fish for something in my bag.  These metal hooks will solve that problem!  They cost a bit more than plastic but will last 3x as long.  These have the same swivel motion as the plastic ones, hooking on the stroller handle bar in 1 second.
B000WH4KYS|5|Sweet soft and cute!<br />My two year old has 3 of these and has loved them since day one. i know my new little one will love them the same.
B004AWPY5K|5|We opted to purchase the normal sized leg warmers (12inch length) instead of the 'Newborn' size as we want our soon to arrive wee one to be able to grow into these. The quality is superb and the shipping was fast (as well as free as most of the items from JuDanzy qualify for free shipping!) Altogether we purchased seven pairs of leg warmers, though as our wee one grows and we acquire a more ample wardrobe we will be purchasing far more.
B002H9XCO8|5|This teether is very simple.  It's the perfect size and shape for small hands, and it doesn't include any extraneous parts that could get in the way of its main purpose.  My brother's baby loves this toy and seems to prefer gumming it over his other, more complicated and flashy teethers.  I like that its phthalate-free and BPA-free.<br /><br />Avent categorizes its teethers into three groups:  Stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3.  This is a stage 1 teether, which Avent describes as \\"Front teeth:  Massages gums and suitable for sterilization.\\"  Stage 2 is for middle teeth, and stage 3 is for back teeth.  Basically, stage 1 is for the earliest stage and is appropriate for small babies.  All in all, a good product from a reputable company.
B004GTLRY4|5|I have only ever used these diapers for my cloth diapering and I will probably never choose another system. I have saved SO much money by avoiding disposables and buying into the new cloth diapering trend of cute cloth diaper covers and crazy inserts and whatever. For my stash, I have 4 sets of these flat diapers, 4 sets of wool covers in s/m/l (2 that look like a binki bottom with velcro straps, and 2 of a version that look like mini shorts,)10 hemp liners for bedtime, and Bumpkins diaper liners for poop clean up, and a pack of Snappi's to secure these flat diapers. I have saved a lot of money by knitting the diaper covers and sewing the hemp liners as well, it's always cheaper to make things yourself then shell out $40+ for single items.<br /><br />So I want to address some things about these diapers:<br />1. You can just boil them once for 20 minutes, throw them in the washer and dryer- but NO fabric softener EVER, and they will be ready for use.<br />2. Yes, they shrink just a SMIDGE.<br />3. Yes, they are no longer perfect and square after washing- they do become regtangular-ish.<br />4. Yes, they will all become a different shape and one will not match another.<br />3. The odd shape of the flat diapers after DO NOT affect folding. The beauty of cloth diapers is that nobody cares if they aren't perfect.<br />4. I have used these diapers folds with no problems: newspaper, burrito, happy anteater, and angel wing. I just adjust the folding as my daughter grows. My favorite is the newspaper fold, I think it's the easiest and is the most comfortable but that's just my opinion.<br />5. Yes, the two hemmed edges are bulky but my daughter has never complained about them, I don't think babies care about things like that, more of an issue with parents.<br />6. How I use them- fold them into my preference, put a diaper liner for poop, secure them with a snappi, put a wool cover over, and then put clothes on. I never had an issue with bulkiness after putting clothes on. Nobody even notices that my daughter has cloth diapers. And for night time, I do the same exact thing but I add a hemp liner for extra absorbency.<br />7. Lastly, if any parent has issues with absorbancy, it is best NOT to use fabric softener, and since these are cloth diapers and not disposables, they are NOT meant to be worn for long periods of time without any additional lining. I change my daughter at least every hour-hour and a half. She's constantly wetting herself.<br /><br />I also have never had an issue with leaks. Only time I have to change her clothes is when she drools on herself or spits up. Her bottom stays perfectly dry.apers.

B001GQ2PLE|4|I purchased the Graco Pack 'N Play with the Bassinet and found it to be exactly what was described. I like the neutral colors and the ease of transport. The padding was actually pretty substantial- more than I expected. I did, however, think that the bassinet's quality did not merit a $13 increase in price from the Pack 'N Play that does not include it. But overall, I am very pleased and would recommend the product. Amazon redeemed themselves this time and shipping was very fast.
B00KTW35OM|4|Took a really long time but it's exactly what I was looking for in perfect condition for the right price
B004GXA6LA|3|We use this seat in our 2nd vehicle and for air travel.  I did not like this seat in its rear facing configuration.  First, I wasn't trilled with needing to use a rolled towel under the seat to get the correct angle (yes, that is in the directions) and second it was really difficult to tighten the straps.  Now that the seat is in the forward facing direction, it works much better and I'm happier with it.  As for air travel, it fit well into the seat and worked great with one of the Brica Roll in Go Seat Transporter.  It was difficult to the the seat belt through the back section but it worked.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Slim<br />Lightweight<br />Air Travel<br /><br />Cons:<br />Difficult to level rear facing<br />Difficult to tighten straps rear facing
B004K6LNSS|1|I would give this 0 stars if possible.  These must be made for dolls and not babies!  Do not buy!!!!!  There is no way to stretch the opening to fit on your baby's head.
B00PV6H3Z8|5|Exactly as described. Fast shipping. A+++++
B001O9H5Q8|5|I used rhiwithis in our car seat and my moon pillow everywhere else, flat spot about gone!  :)  She's 5 months now. Used about a  month or longer.
B006ZSYGOW|5|AA products are the best. Will buy more...
B007F9YPDM|4|We bought this placemat to have something to put in front of our baby when we go to restaurants. He isn't old enough to eat off of it yet, but it provides a nice barrier between him and the table. Before he would just gum the table and anyone who has ever worked at a restaurant knows that they are wiped down with bacteria-laden rags. The suction cups work okay, but a good tug from baby and the whole thing comes up, we suspect that as he gets older and uses it properly this won't be an issue. Overall a good product and worth the price.
B003LQQGE4|5|Kids Love it
B0083973FK|5|These things are a secret life saver. Regardless of how absorbent diaper brands say they are, my kids are special. They could (and can) pee through ANY diaper. Huggies. Luvs. Pampers. They peed through them all (and still slept through the night!). Until we found these. These bad boys soak up EVERYTHING and keep it all in one nicely soaked package that you can toss away with your morning diaper. No more back breaking crib changes (other than the normal laundry). Do yourself a favor and buy a 90 day supply. You won't regret it for a moment.
B007C52ZEA|4|These are great so far! I think if you are bigger busted you could probably wear these with a thinner bra, but for smaller-busted people they will still show a bit of ripples and bumps if your bra is too thin. I just wear them with a thicker bra. I would recommend washing them before you first wear them since they shed a little and the fibers can stick to you. I have a different brand I wear for nighttime but I think these will work great for daytime!
B00LVMSU0S|5|This came exactly as described and pictured. I bought this for my 1 year old daughter to sleep in on a trip to see family. This is a perfect size for her to sleep in. We'll definitely be using this more, it's a great buy!
B007HO4TJK|3|Hard to put together and make it her size. It's what you expect from Cosco . . . . .
B00W6CUSQQ|3|Beautiful pattern and colors, but unfortunately, it is 90% see-through. I guess I should have researched what &#34;muslin&#34; was! It reminds me of medical gauze. Not tightly woven enough for me to feel comfortable in public, and I'd worry about it holding up in the washer/dryer.
B007A52S7G|4|I really like the looks of this bag, but comparing it to the Skip Hop City Chic that cost almost double that I used for my first daughter, it can definitely be improved. First of all, the City Chic had the \\"deluxe\\" changing pad that was easily unfolded, folded, and put away because it went in the back of the bag. This changing pad is impossible to put away in the bag with one hand, which doesn't help if you're changing on the go. I actually don't like the fact that the outside pockets are insulated. I always used them on my other bag for keys and my phone, and these are hard to get those items in and out of. I also use wider bottles which are not easily put in or taken out. I liked the material of the City Chic because it could not be scratched or snagged. I also liked the straps which were more flexible and comfortable. I actually don't use the back pocket or inner zipped pocket because there are so many other pockets to choose from. My other bag lasted over a year and looked brand new. My friend used it after me and so it has now been used by two people for over 3 yrs and is awesome! Another thing that was a great feature was that the other bag had a detachable clutch which could hold aeverything you'd need, and looked like a trendy clutch when you weren't using the diaper bag. That was a nice option. I hate having to throw my wallet inside the bag. Overall, I would definitely purchase the deluxe changing pad to improve this bag. But other than that, there are just too many things about this bag that I don't love. It's a cute bag, but not as functional. If they still made the City Chic, I would pay the higher price for it!
B00820JBGO|5|Fits my daughter well.
B009PNO7AW|5|Looks beautiful in person<br />Brought it for a close friend if mines and she loves it<br />Dissent look cheap nice quality I highly recommended
B001F3YJNA|5|This nursing pillow positions my daughter in the perfect spot to nurse and I'm actually comfortable nursing. I was introduced to this pillow from the lactation consultant's office from the hospital. I was using the boppy before but it was so awkward and uncomfortable for me to nurse because my arms, wrists, and hands would cramp and/or go numb trying to.support my daughter properly. This pillow is amazing because I don't have that problem. I do use a rolled or folded receiving blanket to help support my daughter's head as I nurse if needed. The pillow is firm and higher than others so its very nice. Love this and would recommend to anyone! A great pillow has helped me become more confident with nursing.
B00KDKKD1I|5|Absolutely best customer service! The pillow that came was a bit too soft. I contacted little sleepy head and right away, Chris responded back saying they would send another at no charge! Plus, they let me keep the first! Great quote pillow and great people!
B008818OQ0|4|I bought these when my son was 3 months because everyone said he was teething and I needed small teethers.  These did not fit in his mouth at all.  He is 8 months old now and still has zero teeth.  His mouth is bigger and he now enjoys &#34;teething&#34; on these.
B0041XNDEC|5|I Bought this as a gift for my sister and she LOVED it! She is so excited about this purchase! Great quality product :)
B000GB0NAA|5|I love this set.  Great for teaching to spoon feed in a bumbo seat or high chair.  Very chic.  I have a huge 19 lb. 6 mth old and the neck size is plenty big for her.
B0043D28B4|4|This cloth book is great for little hands because it's light weight and easy to hold.  The pictures are very colorful and it's fun to play Peek-A-Boo with baby as he opens the flaps to see the animals. Also, good learning tool as baby connects looks of animals with names of animals.
B000N351VM|5|We are very happy with this product.  The booster is soft, yet durable and hods up great to our two year old.  We also don't have to worry about the seat slipping as it stays in place perfectly.  Very easy to clean too.
B00AQTWBDE|5|Fits perfectly on the stroller bar for the Uppababy Vista and provides plenty of entertainment for my little guy. The center toy is detachable, so it can be handled and brought to mouth as they get older and want to manipulate the toys more. The other two are attached, so they dont get lost. The ear makes that great crinkly sound that babies seem to love so much and encourages a lot of tactile manipulation. The mirror is a great addition as well as babies never seem to tire from looking at themselves ;) A great toy bar without all the blinking lights or obnoxious music. Just simple play and a gorgeous design. And it matches beautifully with other Skip Hop items as well.
B000TFMJKA|4|Cute item. Our little guy seems to enjoy it so far (he is six months old).
B0030AHK5A|1|I used a friend's older KidCo food mill and it worked great.  It was just like this one only rounder and a bit bulkier, but it did the job of grinding food.  There is a design flaw with this new model.  The plunger is not long enough.  I purchased this with the hope of grinding a little bit of our table food at each meal.  (I did not plan to grind a lot for storage purposes).  I also wanted to take it on trips or to restaurants to make a quick meal for my baby.  Since the plunger is not long enough, lots of food remains in the grinder without being grinded.  Grinding just a little bit of food for one meal is not possible without wasting A LOT of food.  I called KidCo to ask if they have fixed the product since it seems many reviewers have the same complaint.  The person I talked to seemed to be aware of the complaint and apologized that I was not satisfied with the product, but that was all.  If they are aware of the problem, they should correct it.  If you can find an older round model, buy it!!!
B000KJBFC8|1|Do not waste your money, Just use a 3 inch card board box  instead. Costco sells little water bottles in card board boxes. I like these better because they are more stable and there are no creases.
B001UF8BL4|3|It could just be my baby, but he rolled it like twice and didn't care. I love Baby Einstein toys and I would recommend the music box they sell. My baby was fascinated by that.
B00QEI7MS0|5|I♡ it
B004GJXM4C|4|Not as bright as picture. Still cute.
B00CTBLZYS|3|Nice product and good service. Unfortunately,  I can only give 3 stars as my 6 year old chewed through it fairly quickly.
B0079RKCTG|5|I have become addicted to these metal puzzle games since my daughter got me one for Christmas, but the other puzzles I've found were small. This one is nice and sturdy. I used free shipping which took some time, but it was worth the wait.
B000056JMU|5|They do their job and love playtex bottles no air with drop ins. I wouldn't use any other liners or bottles
B005O8IK32|5|great quality
B00HVSV7OC|5|I got this pacifier holder because the fabric type we use left a funky milk smell. Even after we was them. This pacifier if great because it is made a non toxic silicone which does not absorb fluid causing oders. No more smelly pacifier holder.... oh and Teething Toy works great.....
B002KRDFS0|5|We love this light, and so does our 18-month old.  It's just enough light to make him feel comforted at night.  It's not too bright.  You can set it to change colors throughout the night or just set it to one color.  You can also set it up for 30-minutes or for all night.  It's cute, comforting and easy to use.  Our son likes to play with it sometimes.  He loves the Tyrannosaurus.    The price was great and shipping was very quick too.  I had read other reviews before we purchased this regarding problems with the base, but we've had it for a while now with no problems whatsoever--and as I mentioned, our son takes it on and off the base sometimes to play with it.  We're expecting our 2nd child now and have every intention of ordering another light.
B000056HNM|5|Originally, I did not plan to have a changing table for my son. We saw this one online and thought it was pretty and the price is great! The color blends well with our other nursery furniture. The table is the perfect height (and has saved my back). We placed a curved contour changing pad on top and there is still room for wipes and antibacterial soap. The shelves are nice and big and we have 2 big wicker baskets that hold all of the changing supplies and still have room for bibs, blankets, and rattles. Great, useful necessity for the nursery!!
B001ED6BFA|5|This frame was purchased because my Mom passed away just a few months ago.  My son is too young to remember her and she called him her \\"little angel\\".  The frame is a perfect fit in his room and will guarantee that my son knows his \\"Nana\\".
B005BWKTDA|2|This is really cheap, and thin, seems it would rip easily and I don't expect to get much wear out of it. But it will hold wipes a few diapers and maybe a small thing of sanitizer.
B00AIAJ5YE|3|Small...not worth the money for what you get. Nothing great about it for the price you pay. Maybe if it was bigger..
B0052TT6GI|4|I got this for my son when he started solids.  I LOVED the bento-style design of it, plus the different colors so you could \\"color code\\" and remember what you'd put in them!  They are well-built, can take a lot of abuse, and are exactly what I thought they would be.<br /><br />Full Disclosure: I don't use them as much as I had intended... Mainly because I don't make as much food for my son as I had originally intended and instead rely heavily on jars and pouches, especially when we are on the go.<br /><br />Either way, I would still recommend these for any one who is looking for a compact way to store/transport small amounts of food.  (I was thinking the other day, it would also make a great storage container for condiments/sauces if you went on a picnic or camping!)
B002WC7ONK|5|These curtains are a simple pink polka-dot pattern.  The material is thin and will still let some light through.
B004V8VQC8|5|This gym has to be the most fun activity for a small baby. My granddaughter loves it and  can see that it is an important part of the learniing phase.
B00AHVR4KG|5|Awesome jogger. It fits our current car seat like a glove. My only concern is that the front wheel is SUPER sensitive.
B0077P3U6W|5|I'll start with, I read all reviews before I make a big purchase, eespecially if I won't be able to see the product in person before purchase. My husband and I were a little nervous after reading some of the reviews on here but we went ahead and purchased 2 in slate for our spare bedroom/mother-in-law suite. The chairs arrived last night and we were pleasantly surprised. These chairs are great for a small room and look great!  They do swivel perfectly,  they DO glide but not like some of the wooden gliders we have seen. So don't expect this to feel like those types of gliders.  My husband is ~250 lbs 6' tall and fits in them fine but he did say he wishes the back was a couple inches taller. I am 5'7\\" 140 lbs and I think its great. I can't say if it would be good for holding a child in as we don't have children,  but for someone looking for a comfy, small, glider  this is the chair for you. I'm thinking of buying more for our bedroom,  I like these so much.
B00C5X9B4G|1|We purchased two.  Zippers were sewn poorly.  Reading reviewing and safety blogs, infants should never be seating into a bean bag.  Learned this after the purchase.  Would have kept it for supervised play time but quality was very poor.
B0082I1IA8|5|Won't buy any brand but MAM. My son loves them. Love the glow in the dark feature as it makes it easy to find during the middle of the night or during the day if it has fallen under the crib!
B00IP8AG3U|5|A great little seat for the price.  I did buy some extra foam for $1.50 and put under the existing foam to make it really soft.  There is no cup holder, but again, that's okay for the price.
B004A9ZF3Y|5|This ROCKS! SO easy to get the baby food out. Way easier than the Munchkin one (that I also have). Just run some warm water on this to loosen everything up and the frozen food slips right on out!
B008B915K6|5|Nice and convenient. Base has rubber parts to make it anti slip and the spoon fits well in the cover.
B0025Y6742|5|I already bought 2 of them for myself, and now getting another 4 of them for my friends who has kids, they are so easy to use with the big openning, not to worry about spill the food everywhere while feeding or putting the food into container, and for the funtion: keeping them cold/ hot for hours......its great!!!!! I cannot be happy enough for this product!!! recommand for all mommies!!!
B002WB2GB6|5|I love this stroller. I spent a lot of time researching different models. I chose this one because of the features, lightweight and cost. The cup holder is great which you can't seem to find on a lot of models. Bottom basket is small but good enough to hold a jacket and hat.
B001I481LM|5|This pitcher is AWESOME! Our baby is formula fed and this pitcher allows us to make 32 ounces at a time. It has been one of the best purchases we've made for our 5 month old!
B000GX0B3M|5|We purchased the Wheely Bug for our daughter's first birthday.  We are very pleased with it; our daughter loves.  It is very sturdy, and because it has casters (goes in all directions) she does not get stuck very often.  She does not actually ride it yet without help, but she enjoys pushing it all over the place on her own.  It is worth the price.
B001DOKBY2|5|I wasn't sure how it come out but once I assembled it and put away my stuff, it was absolutely perfect. It was one f the easiest furniture to put  together.
B002UXQRNE|5|Good silverware for my grandkids!
B00AIFY38W|4|The only complaint I have about this booster seat is that the arms do not pivot. If the arms pivoted it would get 5 stars. It is a breeze to attach and remove from almost any vehicle. It is light weight and easy to transfer between cars when needed. My oldest child loves it and it makes her feel more independent as she is no longer using the &#34;little kid&#34; (her words) booster with a back, and the youngest is very jealous that she cannot use it yet. She wants her own, but in pink. I would have no problem purchasing another of these for myself or as a gift.
B00175ROGU|5|This was a great chewy for my son that was always chewing on everything. We couldn't break him of the habit. We got this toy and this was the only thing he chewed on. The school had to order him some of these as the ones they had he didn't like.
B004H36ZZA|3|You put them on, they fall right off. You put them back on, they fall right back off. Etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />I'd say these are more the size for 3+ months. They just don't work for a newborn.<br /><br />Other than that they are fine, material is soft, colors are nice.... just sizing is off.
B003N0JXSO|2|This did not really work for my cloth diapers.  I tried using different amounts and finally gave in and got Tide like everyone recommended.
B001Q4MQHY|5|LATCH system should be a must for all child booster seats! Perfect fit in VW Touareg. Paul Frank design definitely stands out in the crowd.
B004NHJHV4|5|I am a first time parent with a 6 month old son. I started researching high chairs, and every time I searched for good high chairs Boon Flair was on the list. This chair is just a great chair all around. The chair is able to move up and down, but you probably won't be using this feature as much. The brake is okay, but you have to press on it with a little force for it to be effective. We don't use the straps because of how close the tray is to my baby. It seems like I've been listing the cons of this chair, but they aren't so much as cons as just additional, maybe superfluous features. The style of this chair is just like its called \\"Flair.\\" When people see your high chair they will take notice and ask questions...there may be some jealousy. The tray is so easy to take off and easy to clean, but it isn't as big as some other high chairs (maybe Graco or Chicco). They also give you an extra tray. The chair itself, because it doesn't have any cracks, is very easy to get food off of. When I put my son in this chair he is able to stay in it for a very long time, like hours, especially if everyone else is at the table with him. It is made to roll on a kitchen floor (tiles and wood), not carpet! The tray can move out some as your child gets bigger. The chair is able to move in all directions, which is great. It does not recline, but that hasn't been a big deal to me. This high chair is well worth the cost, if you have money to spend. If not, then it would be just as effective to get another high chair for lesser price. However, if you get this high chair you will not be disappointed. I love this high chair, and so does my son. I would recommend this chair to everyone who has the financial means to get it. Seriously, this chair is awesome!
B00BCXVQWK|5|So cute and it stays stuck to my mirror
B00T2DYFU2|3|Most of the time we buy plastic junk toys, teething gels, tablets, or necklaces for our children but we never stop to think what is in any of those things that we are letting our child gnaw on all day long. Gnaw on with open wounds on their teeth, over and over daily. Beabies are 100% safe for your infant. Do you want to know what kind of product standards it has to meet to be that safe? Here is the list, All Beabies Teethers are: BPA free, FDA Approved, Made of food grade silicone, no harmful chemicals, PVC-Free, Latex-Free, Rubber-Free, Lead-Free silicone. They contain no vinyl, phthalates, plastic, nitrosamines, cadmium, or heavy metals. They are taste and smell-free.<br /><br />So the big question is what did our Little Miss, and her mommy, and I think of Beabies Teethers?<br />The Beabies Teething Toy Set is a set of three toys; a train, car and elephant. It also comes with a free Teether holder. These toys are very thick and chunky. They are suitable for very young babies; I would say three to nine month olds. They do not stay cold more than half an hour at the most. However, if you have a gnawer that needs something it is the type with the bumps on the toys and the big handles for babies that may be teething early. Other than that I would stick with the Necklace and Bracelet combination by Beabies.<br /><br />Next Generation Stay At Home Mom Gives Beabies Teething Toy Set 3 Stars!
B00BJMXKVO|5|This is a great gate and the spring works wonderfully. Def recommend this gate
B00F33YB5O|5|I love it
B00JV305GQ|4|I used the Goumihat for my newborn. So far, this is the only hat that stays on the longest on my baby's head. I love that you can tie it so that it stays put and also how it covers his ears... Perfect for colder days. All other hats I've tried on him tends to fall off pretty soon after I put on his head, so I appreciate that with the Goumihat, I don't have to constantly fix it of pick it up off the floor. Two other things that I love about if is the softness of the material and how adorable it looks on my baby! As much as I like the hat, I'm only giving it 4 stars because even though it stays on my baby's head longer than most other hats, I still hate how I do have to fix the fit on his head several times a day.
B00U1UQ4CC|5|The b30x30 Inch Soft Fleece Blanket by bogo Brands is a very nice blanket for any child. This blanket is nice and soft, comfortable and a great blanket to go with the swaddling blanket I also have from bogo Brands. I had planned to give my neighbor who just had a baby both blankets but my granddaughter had other ideas. She said Grandma why can't I have one? I told her the difference in the blankets and she said the swaddling blanket can go to the baby but I would like this one please. She Won!!  My granddaughter is a blanket feign and she loves this one. It's been washed and dried a couple off times and is just as soft as when we got it. The blanket is well made and durable with great stitching to keep it together. I received the fleece blanket at a discount for my honest unbiased review and that is what I have given. If your in the market for a soft, good quality, comfortable baby blanket I would recommend this one.
B004EL6O1U|4|So far these are the best cloth diapers I have tried!  I love the colors and they look so cute on my baby boy!  The snaps look nice although can be a little difficult with a squirmy baby!  I have some with the hook and loop and they are much easier to put on the baby, but they don't look as nice after a while (I got them used so not sure if there would be a way to prevent them from looking so yucky). I love how there are two inserts and the longer one has snaps so it can be folded and used for a newborn!  I put the folded part in front for my little guy and this helps hold more pee with out having to put two inserts in!  I think it might make it a little less bulky that way!  I wish they weren't so bulky, but I think that is the case with all cloth diapers!  The bumGenius brand diapers seem to stain a little more than another brand that I have used, but if you put them out in the sun the stains come right out!  The pocket opening is in the back which is ok except if they get poop up there back!  Then your fingers might get poop on them when you pull the insert out, but i wash my hands after changing him anyway so no big deal to me!  These are alot easier to stuff than another brand that i have!  i really think these make cloth diapering quite easy!  I wish i could use them more, but my little guy seems to have very sensitive skin and gets diaper rash when he doesn't have some sort of cream on, so i have to use disposable since you cant use creams with the cloth!
B00005BYUR|5|Before I delivered my son, I knew that I would be bottle feeding due to previous issues.  I decided to purchase the Playtex angled bottles.  Once my son was born, I realized that was a mistake.  He was getting way too much air in the nipple, therefore, he was having alot of painful gas.  When he was just 5 days old, I decided we needed something else.  I went out and purchased the Ventair by Playtex, hoping that would help.  The Ventair did not make any difference!  So as a last resort, I went BACK to the store and purchased several different types.  One of them was the Dr. Brown's.  After just one feeding I knew that I didn't even need to try the others!  My son did not get even one air bubble in the nipple!  While I do agree with the other reviews, there are a few extra pieces to wash, I am more than willing to wash them if my son can be more comfortable after his meal.  And quite honestly, it only takes a few extra moments.  They are worth the money and time because \\"THEY WORK\\"!
B002IWYXH4|5|A friend gave me this diaper pail instead of the Diaper Genie that I had registered for because she said it used regular trash bags and worked just as well.  I was a little skeptical at first, but now that we've been using it--I love it!  I don't have to worry about having special bags for it and it never smells!  I even have a dog who loves trash and he doesn't even notice that it;s there.  I would recommend this instead of the Genie any day!
B00I9IRM92|4|I was hoping this would miraculously drift my 5 month old off to sleep. It didn't.<br /><br />It is very beautiful though. I love the lights. It's much smaller than I thought it would be. The cord is a bit short too, so it is hard to get it in the center of the room, which is the ideal location of the projector so it is on the ceiling. Mine is on the wall and the ceiling in the pictures since it is close to the wall. To have it centered, you would need to use batteries or an extension cord.<br />It is very peaceful and soothing to watch, I can go to sleep looking at it, wish my baby would get on board. I also like that it automatically turns off after a certain amount of time, didn't see that anywhere on the description when I purchased it so I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Hopefully in the future it will help him fall asleep on his own.
B000GKU7C0|5|My son HATES...HATES his teeth being brushed. He screams and cries like I am trying to pull a tooth instead of brush them. He has been that way since about 9 months when we first started to brush his teeth with a real tooth brush. So I was anxious to find something to help me brush his teeth with him thinking it is just a yummy chewy toy.<br /><br />This is made out of a soft silicon, but it is sturdy so that it can not have a chunk bitten off. It is the perfect size for little mouths and hands. It has a tray with soft bristles on both sides where teething gel like tooth paste can be put. My son chews on this for long periods of time. Which is why we almost always loose it because he crawls off with it. But every time we pull it out he gets excited and lunges for it.<br /><br />Just wish I would have bought more than one. :)
B000LM7OQ0|5|I bought these for my girlfriend because she always spills in my apartment. The characters were a little off-putting at first but after a few close spills they've become a staple.
B007K5LZ6Q|5|This baby book includes things you probably wouldn't even think to record, such as the headline news from baby's birth date. Comes beautifully packaged and seems well made.
B004K6PM62|1|The item I received was nothing like what is pictured here. I received 12 of the same animal: all blue sharks that were very cheap looking.
B004FPAS6W|1|i would never recommend this seat, horrible and very uncomfortable mainly due to the head pillow being too bulky it keeps the neck bent forward
B002C3IAOQ|5|Love love love the little pink mouse backpack!! My 2 year old needed a backpack for daycare and this is perfect! It's girlie (pink), roomy, and has a space for her name. Perfect for her size (toddler)!! She even wants to carry her babies in it :) A++++ definitely recommend!!!
B006Z2BZOW|4|This was a good buy for the price, the crib is small would work best for newborn to 1 year only, if your baby is big not a good choice.<br /><br />Crib mobile hard to use with this design but we are making it work would be a great newborn crib.
B000F6R3TU|5|This stuff is messy. That being said, it came off the baby with baby oil on baby wipes.  We ended up taking several foot and hand prints.  We then took the best ones and had them copied at Staples.  It was not easy to get good prints, but persistence paid off and the copy idea worked perfectly.
B001QXCF0I|5|Gift for a toddler -- she LOVED IT!!
B00440CZVY|2|My 14 month old daughter loved this cup and it was easy to clean, didn't leak, etc. all the stuff you look for in a baby cups - but the 2nd time she dropped it off her high chair the cup slit at the bottom & it had to be thrown away. It should be much sturdier.
B00ESXTNP8|5|Help teething babies
B00NU5G0TW|1|It's smaller than I thought. The thing that goes on the wrists it's simple a small piece of fabric that has no support for the figures.
B00186ZQUO|5|I like this product because it heats very quickly.  Yes, the beep is quite loud, especially in the middle of the night.  (Fortunately, we didn't have many middle of the night bottles since nursing was an option as long as I was home.)  It does get scale in the bottom, even when using filtered water, but there are cleaning instructions that worked well.  My biggest concern was it sometimes worked too well.  As long as you are responsible and test the food or liquid before giving it to baby, the only problem is waiting for things to cool.<br /><br />The other warning concerns bottles.  Some bottles will melt under the heat of this tool.  These [[ASIN:B0006FHBAQ Playtex 3 Pack Baby Drop Ins Nurser Holder 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary]] melted.  These [[ASIN:B000056HM5 Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set]] didn't.
B00GMD8Q5A|5|I got these as replacements for my Spectra s2 pump, and they fit and work great! They seem to create a much better suction then the membranes that came with my pump, and they are a lot more sturdy. I was having issues with the other membranes falling off into the milk while pumping, which was a HUGE pain, so I was very grateful that these worked instead. Great price, too!
B000JVXZF2|5|This is a great product, I love that it is compact and light weight.  We currently leave it secured to a chair all the time, but fold it down if we need to set something on it, but knowing that if I wanted to take it with us for a trip to Grandma's or just tuck it away because we'd actually have guests over is very helpful.  Also, I am not a fan of the Bumbo seat or any of the ones with the toys on the tray because she does not like things in her face, and she is a very good escape artist.  This seat keeps her right where she needs to be and it's very sturdy and secure.<br /><br />Fully recommend this product.
B00KI02IRA|5|Let me tell you a story. We have an awesome little girl who has always been a good sleeper. Like sleeping through the night at 7 weeks good sleeper. The only issue we've really had with her has been her bad reflux, so she slept in our room until she was 5 months old (in case she had a bad spit up in the night we could get to her quickly).<br /><br />So when we moved her to her crib upstair at 5 months (she was still swaddled at this point) she thought it was party time. She would spend an hour to 2 hours at bed time manuvering her arms out of the swaddle, rolling around her crib, putting her paci in & out of her mouth, and eventually working herself into an exhausted fit where she was inconsolably crying. Good times. This went on for a frustrating two weeks before my husband had a friend tell him about this sleep suit. I literally ordered it on my phone from Amazon while trying to unsuccessfully calm her down in a fit of desperation. I thought that there was no way this thing worked but I was up to try anything.<br /><br />Two days later when it arrived and I put it on my daughter at bed time I was literally crying laughing from how ridiculous she looked (think a mix of the stay puff marshmallow man and the little kid from the Christmas story). BUT we put her down and after 10 minutes of trying to move around and realizing she couldn't, she was OUT. She roused once or twice with whimpers for her paci but she slept for 13 hours. 13 HOURS PEOPLE! I HAVE A CHILD WHO SLEEPS UNTIL 9AM.<br /><br />So just buy it. Seriously. And buy a 2nd one to use while the other one is drying (I recommend air drying it so it doesn't shrink).
B001NJRGIG|5|After trying several cabinet locks, we finally found these good old fashioned metal ones.  My toddler cannot get past these.  We needed a drill for the screws, but other than that installation was easy.  I never scrape my fingers on these when opening drawers or cabinets.   And they are inexpensive to boot!
B000MADQNQ|2|We bought this system because of its safety profile and the Manhattan was at a great price. Now I am regretting the decision because after using it for the last 2 months with my newborn, I am finding some Cons. The carseat is very heavy as is the stroller. Combined weight seems to be 30 lbs (i have not weighed it). Folding it is easy but it is still heavy to lug into the car and pretty much takes up the whole trunk of my CRV. It is not a great option to travel with, because of the size. Re: Travel, the Keyfit carseat is NOT compatible with 90% of the lightweight travel strollers out there (unlike Graco, Peg Perego, Cosco, etc). This is a huge negative. I am now considering shopping for a whole new stroller. Worst of all - the carseat makes her SWEAT and it does not breath at all it seems. The sun shade does not cover her completely so it's a game of adjusting sun shades every 5 minutes on walks.   Would not buy this again.
B0042D69WY|5|This is an awesome item if you just have had a baby.  My sister had twins so I got them one of these.  I know the Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing is wonderful!  My parents got me one after I had my daughter Elizabeth.  This is a soothing swing for babies.  My sister is so happy that we got this for her.  Makes for a wonderful baby shower gift.  It will be well used.
B0000798KZ|5|We installed this gate in our home at the top of the stairs.  We loved it because it can swing both ways or you can install the piece that makes it swing one way.  Easy to install if you are good in following and reading the instructions and handy with tools.  Very secure, sturdy, light weight and wished it was just a few inches taller especially being at the top of the stairs. Doesn't chip or dent, so far.  It makes a \\"Clicking\\" sound when shut.  I had two plastic gates that I received at my baby shower; took those back to the store because they were just cheap and not sturdy at all.  I would recommend this gate.
B002YQPDFK|5|I just got this tub and it fits perfectly in our guest bath's tub.  Tub was easy to inflate (once my hubby figured out it is one way valve and needs to be squeezed when blowing).<br />My daughter is 7 months and she loves it...she has plenty of space and loves to sit in it ...she can stand up too with my supervision without toppling over.<br /><br />So far, I am very happy with the product.
B005IWM7V0|5|SO CUTE AND GOOD QUALITY
B00AJF7Q4O|3|I am very disappointed in the quality. After having it for only one week I had to sow it in TWO places. The hands came apart from the &#34;blanket&#34; and there was a hole in the back of the head. And my daughter only sleeps with it! Very disappointed.
B000V88HJM|5|Best clippers for little ones
B001COPE86|5|I recently was given the opportunity to test out and try this Philips LCD Digital Baby Monitor with DECT Technology for Zero Interference Guaranteed and jumped at the chance. We love to try out new baby products and my husband loves anything techie. We've had bad luck here with a bunch baby monitors (4 kids) and have either broken them or found them to be intolerable and not of much use due to lots of interference. With the monitor we were using recently I could barely hear my baby because of all the static and alien noises that took it over, top that with picking up activity from a neighboring home and parts of phone conversations - that monitor was scrapped. So, I really thought this Philips monitor would be right up our alley as it claims to have Zero Interference Guaranteed.<br /><br />So what's it all about, and do you NEED it?<br /><br />What is DECT Technology and why is it important<br /><br />Do you want to have the whole world listening in on your child, what is going on in your home, or phone conversations?<br /><br />Hopefully, the answer is no! I value my privacy and the privacy of my baby and with this latest DECT technology I may just have found my solution.<br /><br />DECT technology stands for Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication. What it is, is a digital technology that enables you to have a private and secure baby monitor. The monitor chooses an unused channel and is smart enough to detect any interference on that channel and switch itself to a new channel so that you are the only one listening in.<br /><br />Sounds great, right? That's the upside of privacy and if you're house is anything like ours; you got cell phones, blackberries, wireless routers, cordless phones, microwaves, kids wireless micro phones, walkie-talkies, xbox controllers....etc<br /><br />Ready for the downside?<br /><br />First of all. How does approximately $100-$150 sound for a baby monitor? Ouch, right? Most monitors I've seen tend to be in the under $50 range for a monitor that allows you to listen in and usually there's some sort of visual display (like lights). This monitor is priced along the lines of the VIDEO monitors that allow you to watch your child. But, this monitor is strictly audio (plus lights). But, oh..there are a few other great features about it that are pretty nifty gadgets that I've not seen on other monitors, and so you decide for yourself if it's worth shelling out moola.<br /><br />My Experience<br />I love that this monitor is quiet and I don't have to listen in on aliens and other peoples conversations. I also really appreciate that this monitor uses a technology that ensures our privacy also, and I trust that using this other people are not listening in on us. We have more than the average amount of wireless devices in our house hold so if we are not getting any interference, neither will you.<br /><br />I think that this monitor has the cool factor in terms of the way that it looks. The baby unit is an long 3-D triangle that plays a lot of different tunes, with volume control and it has a little nightlight build into the unit.  The unit is pretty small and will sit nicely on a night table.  . The parent unit is small and portable. You can attach a belt clip or a neck lanyard on it. The unit is made and feels really well compared to the other unit we'd had over the years.<br /><br />Setting this monitor up piece of cake. I unpacked it, put batteries in it, plugged it in and  I was able to take it out and start using it, which included \\"linking\\" the monitors together following the instructions that were fairly idiot proof !.<br /><br />Now, as I mentioned before this monitor has lots of cool features. Probably the most useful for me actually has been the temperature monitoring. The parent unit displays what the temperature is in the baby's room in either Fahrenheit or Celsius degrees. My son's room is one of the cooler rooms in the home because it is on an end of the house, so I was quite surprised to see that even during the day her room gets a bit chillier than I thought. As the weather gets chillier here I really appreciate knowing the exact temperature of his room. I set the monitor so that an alarm goes off if the temperature goes out of a certain zone - indicating the room is too hot or too cold.<br /><br />Using the parent unit you can turn on and activate the baby unit to play 5 different lullaby songs which play for a few minutes and then shut off. There's also a nightlight feature which lights up but I've found the nightlight feature to be kind of useless but the songs are nice but my son is not into it.  I was thinking that the nightlight feature would actually be like one of those projector/soothers that they have for kids and put on a light show on her ceiling or walls, but its just not that cool HAHA! It's simply a little circle of very dim light.<br /><br />If you are like me, you'll lose the cordless parent unit. If you do this, simply go to the baby unit and you can page the parent unit. I found mine behind the couch (it had fallen down thru the cushions), which is where I often lose the remote and the cordless telephone too! You can also use the paging feature in reverse and talk thru the parent unit into the baby's room.<br /><br />You do all these cool features by using the menu on the parent unit and scrolling thru the features which are displayed on a small LCD screen. Admittedly, I'm not very good at using this menu and end up selecting something I didn't want to do or exiting out when I don't want to. I'm sure it will just be a matter of time until I'm whipping thru the menu like an old pro but the learning curve is longer when its something you are dealing with in the middle of the night and are half asleep!<br /><br />So, overall. Do I like this monitor or not? Well, yes I like it and love that it is crystal clear and I don't have to listen to space aliens. I really really really appreciate that it uses a technology that helps protect my privacy also. And, the temperature feature has come in way more handy than I thought it would. For a price, I would I buy it.  BEST baby monitor on the market today!r gets chillier here I really appreciate knowing the exact temperature of his room.

B000E89BNU|3|The nipple brush is very useful.  Better than the rubber tips of other brands. However the bristles of the bottle brush portion is very stiff.
B004S8MGHU|2|The material seems to make my skin itch around my breasts. I've never encountered a reaction quite like this before to any materials. Perhaps my breasts have just become sensitive since I've given birth and started pumping/feeding, but I every time I use this bra, I get itchy breasts and red marks; especially on the underside. I'll try re-washing it.
B005UV0UF4|5|Very good product.
B002NWMNJO|4|This wall decal is as cute as can be, and it's of course really easy to apply... I'm glad they provided a miniature picture of how they have it arranged... it already looks great, so why change it?  I have smooth walls, and decals from several different companies.  These are more like heavy-duty stickers, than the sheer-feeling decals from the other companies (although I'm sure they'll peel off easily when I want them to).  Also, my walls are completely untextured, but when I first applied them, they started peeling, so I just applied more pressure, and they've been okay for about a week now.  The other brands haven't peeled off the same walls even a little bit.  I guess I'll have to wait and see what happens when it heats up in my home.  But, they really are as cute as in the picture!
B00G4IS540|5|I love this diaper bag. It is very nice. I was afraid to order it online but it came and it was what I expecting.
B000YDDF6O|5|dont just buy one, buy two!!  our son has LOVED this toy since he was 3 months old (now 10 months).  he plays with it in his car seat non-stop. the lights intrigue him and the big button is easy for him to push.  it's all around just a great toy!  hope your little one loves it as much as ours does!
B007TLVPWU|1|Huge mistake. These are the cheapest quality, most thin wall decals ever. You can't even peel them off without ruining them. Had to throw them away, was so frustrated. Trying to get it off, and it gets ripped bc it's so thin, etc. awful product...complete waste if money.
B00E71SJQ0|5|My son loves his &#34;big boy&#34; seat.  It is lite weight and easy to move from car to car.  He can still sleep in the car but still have room to move around/relax.  I would recommed this item to anyone looking to buy a booster seat.  I personal don't like just having a bottom half, although as my son grows the back could come off if need be.
B000AKB4IM|5|so cute
B007KFEJNW|5|Just received this cover yesterday and the first thing my son did was explode in it. I breastfeed him so he has those creamy mustard poops. He always used to explode out his backside,  where his legs come out of the huggies snug and dry diapers. The moment I made the change to flat cloth diapers,  he exploded and this cover kept all his mustard poop in! It's also a very attractive,  light and soft cover. I immediately hand washed it and hung it outside to dry. I checked it in an hour and it was completely dry! It might have been dry for a while actually.  I'm very impressed with this diaper cover. I don't understand why people chose to pay more for these types of covers by other expensive brands. I bought 4 and I can keep reusing them when my son pees. I'm so happy. The black one is my favorite.
B000MZCKVK|1|I'm really sorry to give anything a bad review, but this thing is a waste of money. My daughter opened the box, took about three minutes to look at the monkey, potty and book and that was that. She wanted NOTHING to do with it. She potty trained just fine without it, and I think this may be a good toy if you're the lucky parents of the type of kid this may work on.<br /><br />Too much trouble, too much explaining to the child and it is time better spent on other things. Let your kid tell you they need to pee instead of always reminding them.<br /><br />Nice that a Dr. came up with it, but not worth the money in my book.
B000Q7G3VM|5|Exactly what I had been looking for!! Great price. This is an excellent way for kids to learn who people are, especially when grandparents don't leave near.
B0018LLZXQ|5|A+
B004AHMCKA|4|My six month old loves his new toy for his high chair!  This helps keep him entertained during mealtime and is also good for learning.  I would definitely recommend it!
B00IWY8VCK|2|Really cheaply made, I'm returning.
B00BEJP4HU|5|Highly recommend.  Best umbrella stroller I could find.  Excellent features especially the very soft and comfy seat, recline, and canopy extender.  Uppababy really thought about the needs and comfort of a toddler (and parent!!)
B000S8O9ME|5|I was leary about the quality, durability, and reliability of this product when I ordered it.  My sister, who is handicapped, visits me a few weeks at a time.  She is unstable in our shower and is afraid of falling. She suggested I get &#34;something&#34; not only for her but for my aging husband also.  I was worried that it would not &#34;grab&#34; and hold tight. I was concerned that it would give way causing one of them to fall. They both use it for balance and support when stepping in and out of the shower stall.  In one of the reviews that I had read previously, it said to make sure that the suction portion did not sit on the grout line between the tiles.  I followed this advice and it works beautifully!  I know of two people who really appreciate my buying this safety grip bar.
B0060SG3L6|5|Love it.  Almost always in my dishwasher for the little items that I need to clean for my baby.  An essential item.
B002MY3HBQ|5|We have a friend that recommended this to us.  She makes her own baby food and freezes it in this tray for use later.  We will give it a whirl when our baby arrives.  It seems like a well made product.  It looks like it is good for BIG Jello-shots too!
B006ZJQOXM|5|Of the newborn cloth diaper brands I tried (BumGenius, Blueberry, Imagine, Lil Joey), this was my favorite in terms of fit and ease of use. It is trim, and you don't have to stuff or button any inserts into it, which is great when you're in a hurry to calm your newborn. I never had any leaks or blowouts with these, but I liked the newborn Imagine diapers more for wicking away moisture and absorption. My LO could wear wet Imagine diapers longer between changes than BumGenius. One setback is that they don't clip down under the umbilical stump, so I used the Lil Joeys for about 2 weeks until it fell off, which is about how long those lasted before they were outgrown. LO is now 2 months old, 10lbs, and 22 inches, and has almost outgrown these. They may last another 2-3 weeks. It was totally worth it to me, because the one-size diapers are too bulky right now.
B0013RV0D0|5|This is perfect for prevent kids from locking themselves in rooms and shutting the door on their fingers.  We have these all over our house!
B00M0DWUWG|5|nice size fits all shopping carts love it!!
B00ED20JZW|4|Received as a gift. My soon LOVEs chilling and sleeping on his bear mat. It is super soft and provides some cushion from the floor. Only negative is that the fuzz sticks to pacifier nipples.
B00LXIYMMK|5|Love. Love.  I've done a lot of research on the new trends from amber teething necklaces to these rubber ones. I've even talked with my pediatrician who recommended what her patients told her which was the amber ones. However, seeing the reviews I went out on a limb and purchased this one. It was the best decision ever. My baby absolutely loves to play with it and Teethe on it, so  there's  two bonuses. Plus,  I am always getting compliments on my turquoise teething necklace because it is so vibrant in color. No one ever suspect that the teething necklace.
B003Y732II|5|lo recomiendo 100%, buena calidad, es antiresbalante, apropiado para niños, recibido a tiempo y en excelente estado. buena compra, satisfecha
B00815PFV0|1|Battery life is AWFUL.  It's 4 months old and we can't get any real use out of it unless its plugged In. Very disappointing for a Motorola
B001PRCJRO|5|Have held up great in the dishwasher and images have not worn off like other brands. Will buy them again if I need more.
B00H8N26FO|5|This is a great stroller, light and comfortable, the price is also great. The shock absorption in the wheels makes a big difference when taking the baby for a ride in the city. It can fully recline to allow the baby to sleep very comfortably. The tray underneath is small, and you have to buy separately the cup holder and organizer for cell phones and other things, however I think it is worth it given the price.
B009ONJVIQ|5|First I was on the brink of returning this BUT after looking the carrier over well, I found the solution to my problem.  My problem was (and I read a few other reviews about the same issue) was that the carrier (in the front facing position) was cutting into my 4 month olds legs and turning the purple.  The part where the legs spread in the front facing position was just to wide for her, after looking closely, I found two snaps at the base on the front design portion where the legs spread right above (about an inch) the hip belt and snaps on the front of the hip belt (to the side of the front design).  I unsnapped these and folded them to snap on the design portion.  This solved the problem!  It made the \\"V\\" that was needed for her smaller self.  So, with that being said, this is hands down the most comfortable carrier.  I have a Bjorn, that is now painful to carry her in @ 13 pounds but great for when they are smaller, I tried the Ergo that was also comfortable but lacked the front facing and the straps needed constant adjustment because they wouldn't stay stationary.  The padded adjustable shoulder straps are very comfortable, the hip belt to fabulous and baby and I love this.  I wear her for at least 2+ hours a day and we also use it for hiking.  Haven't tried all positions yet, but I'm sure they will work out great.  Also, I can comfortable breastfeed while she is facing me, I just let out the straps a little, move the carrier around a notch or two and there we go. Only downfall is the strap connecting the two shoulder straps is a bit of a pain to get connected/unconnected but with a little practice, it's not to bad.  Worth the little pain for such a comfortable carrier.
B005JKI2R4|5|works with any pacifier, my son can grab it easily and stick it back into his own mouth. If he chews on it, it doesn't get all soggy like cloth ones.
B0012LZD5I|3|Not recommended if your baby spits out a lot as the material is very thin and not absorbent. 1 side terry cloth and the other side waterproof lining. I bought these as my baby is drooling a lot.
B00FRS2C2E|4|Love it.
B007MCQA9O|2|We used this for about 9 months and now it doesn't even turn on! The screen is small so you can't see much except movement (which is what I expected) It was okay until it broke. Won't be buying this brand again!
B0015PBDLY|5|We have two Learning Towers in our house - one for our 4 1/2 year old and one for our 1 1/2 year old.  They both love to stand in it and help us cook or stand in it to eat their lunch.  It is a very sturdy product and we can't imagine our lives without it!
B00BXE5MRS|4|Sturdy cup. Truly spill-proof. Good price! My son didn't take to it right away like he did another cup, but he seems to like it now. I think the spout is just a bit harder than he needed at the time.
B00305HF0A|4|I am in LOVE with this changer. It is such a lifesaver with a wiggly baby. I purchased the navy, and it is a true navy color. It sits under a window with direct sunlight but I haven't noticed any fading or color change at all. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the boxes did not come with all parts. I ordered 2 (one for us, and one for grandma's house) and neither included the belt or Velcro strips that were listed as included. I contacted BabySmart directly and they send all missing things right out to me, so we are back in business. In fact, their customer service was wonderful to deal with! I HIGHLY recommend this product!
B00FSK1GCI|3|The board as self is great and fits on every stroller. I just wished it would be a little wider and not so long more like the lascal board so I could put my feed under it while walking. It's a little bit difficult to walk since there is always one foot bump on it. I have to walk on the side pushing the stroller with one hand, that's why only 3 stars. But sometimes it's worth for not listening about the complaining that my oldest one can't walk anymore.
B007S1T42O|3|Bought it for my friend and she says she likes it, but what's not realized is that the giant &#34;sponge&#34; needs to be rung out and dried afterwards, a little inconvenient.
B002T94RKE|3|My only complaint is that it only plays the music for about 2 minutes and that is no where near long enough to keep her distracted while she falls asleep.
B006ZSYGOW|5|Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time. Thanks!
B0006ZZB0I|4|This is a really cool toy for such a low price. The glass is very thin (which stands to reason since the heat of your palm is what is \\"heating\\" the liquid) which makes it fragile. Mine was packaged well and made it in 1 piece. It takes about 10 seconds for the liquid to \\"boil\\" up to the top and is overall a cute idea. I got it for an 11 year old as a stocking stuffer for christmas and I'm sure the whole family will enjoy it that morning. I loved it.<br /><br />Pros - Cool science based, geeky toy for not a lot of money.<br />Cons - fragile, so it could break while shipping or during use by smaller kids.
B0035RQF4K|5|We first bought these locks so we didn't have to drill into our cherry cabinets.  THe installation is a breeze and required no tools.  The locks are very sturdy and it even took the grandmas a while to figure out how to open them.  They work very well and I like the feature that you can leave the cabinets closed and leave the locks unlocked if you need to access the cabinet a lot and the baby is not around.  I must say that our toddler at 2.5 yrs did figure out how to open the child locks.  I do think she has above average dexterity.  She was able to disarm the grandparents lesser child locks at 18 months.  Bottom line these are expensive locks but have held up and worked great for us.  I would recommend these locks and I would purchase them again.
B008COEGUG|5|Cannot recommend highly enough. Makes it harder for little ones to push their arms and legs through. It also helps trap pacifiers ;) (if your little one is anything like mine, he likes to shove it out and then cries that it's gone) it also adds enough padding to help if they roll over and bonk their head. It allows great airflow (SIDS risk) and the chew rails really protect the wood.
B00L6IJ5II|5|Very nice keepsake quality. Pretty design and very good paper quality.
B0057GU264|2|My 3 year old got this as a birthday present, and she really likes it.  It fits her and her 5 year old sister well.  It is made out of pressboard, and it just isn't sturdy.  It's now about 3 weeks past her birthday, and the red piece that holds up the fabric container broke.  She thinks we need to buy a new one - Nope!  I'd suggest buying something more sturdy.
B0036TGYP2|3|When I received the decals, I was pleasantly surprised about how big they were and how many was received.  They will easily fill a large room.  However, after applying all the decals to clean walls I was disappointed the next day when two had come off the wall and others were coming off.  I took a credit card and ran it over all the decals which has helped.  However, now the cold weather has come, I find myself doing this every few days as they come unattached again.
B00J7KU3LA|5|This has been great for getting boogers out of my 3 month old. She definitely doesn't love it but it works a million times better than those regular suction bulbs. I love it. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00I3ZI5K6|2|Cups are ok, sturdy abs don't spill, like others said, I got the wrong colors and it was too much hastle to return.
B000I2OKDI|5|My daughter is 4-5 months old, and it can be difficult to find toys that are simple enough for her to interact with without being boring to her.  She is learning how to grab and move things, but she is still not very good at it.  A typical stacking toy or blocks are too advanced for her and can lead to frustration, but these magnetized bugs are very forgiving.  She only has to get the toys close for them to stick together, and she is delighted by that.
B00SLLK4FQ|4|Cute, functional. They sent us grey instead of orange, but otherwise great product. Baby hates wearing them, of course!
B00SHQMEGC|5|I was so excited when I came across this wall decal.  We have a room in our home that we call the “sunshine room” because the animals tend to go lay in this room since it gets the most sun during the day.  Over time, this room has sort of migrated into a special room for the animals.  There are some pet beds and a couple of comfy chairs placed in the places where the sunshine hits so the animals can be comfortable.  When one is missing, we can normally find them in the sunshine room.  When I saw this decal set I knew I had to have it for this room!  We placed it on the wall over our favorite kitty’s chair and it looks perfect.  The link to the video with tips in instruction made installation a breeze.  This is a high quality vinyl and I believe if we needed to move it, we could do so without damage.  When this room is transitioned into a nursery, the decal will be able to stay since this particular saying definitely works for a girl or a boy.  The script is elegant without being too “froofy” (I think that’s a word).  The decal comes in a heavy duty tube so it can’t be damaged during shipping and it’s big enough that it doesn’t make the decal curve too much if you’re not ready to put it up right away.  I honestly think it was easier to put this up on the wall than it would be to hang a framed picture on the wall.  Another great thing to remember is that you can place different parts of the decal in several different ways.  The “you are my” portion of the saying can go anywhere around, above, or beside the decal you want.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.  Honestly, I love it!
B00S6PC982|5|Awesome way to keep stuff from ending up on floor or ground!
B006ZVV0P2|5|Bought these kick mats to use in our Hyundai Sonatas to protect the seat backs from our 3-year-old. They fit great, were simple to install, and they function perfectly. Bonus: Our child likes to stash her things in the pockets.
B000TW3BM8|5|The small is up to 14 lbs the large is 15-22 lbs for you moms who need to know ..will this fit my baby....<br />WORKS like a charm!!! use w/ a swing and the soothing sounds sampler from Amazon<br />or your own sound machine and baby quiets down beautifully. Very safe, keeps hands away from scratching baby's face, secure and warming...obviously use cotton in summer, microfleece Fall/Spring and flannel for Winter.<br />also many believe this helps prevent SIDS..I don't know about that, but it can not hurt in my opinion.<br />GREAT pRICE...  check around, this a deal!!!
B008R6KF9A|5|Nice and funny
B003AJXY4M|5|Thank you !
B004IZWQYQ|4|Great you but the ramps come apart very easily which can be frustrating for little ones
B004PVUHGC|5|Oh my goodness, i LOVE this dish! I've had it a few weeks and have used it countless times so far. We take it to restaurants with us for dinners when there are unhealthy or too expensive items for my 18 month old. I love that you can change the division part depending on what's for lunch or dinner. Stainless steel makes my cold things stay colder longer and warm things warmer longer. HOORAY fresh baby!!!
B002WN2B6O|5|We have used this sterilizer for almost 3 years now and it's still working perfectly fine. We use it a lot (up to three times a day for the baby's first months), 3 kids in a row and so far no complaints.<br />It works for bottles, pacifiers, breast pump parts, etc. So far nothing has been damaged. It does not take too much space compared to other brands and it is very fast.<br />We rinse the hot plate with water after using it and clean it with vinegar when it has white deposits (probably once a month).<br />The only con is that it does not dry the bottles, but you have to pay more than twice the price to get that feature and they take more than 1 hr, so personally I prefer the price and speed of this one.<br />I definitely would recommend this sterilizer.
B004QQ9492|5|After searching for Doc McStuffins Ben and Anna huggie monkeys with no luck, we ordered these.  My 2 yr old loves them! All I have heard is &#34;Mimi, Momo&#34;
B001P4208A|5|I purchased this for my home now that I have a grandchild. I had one for my previous home for my children. That one was passed on when no longer needed to a grandma, who passed it on to another grandparent.
B00CSAWJPO|5|Affordable, and my son loves being able to site at the dinner table (as opposed to sitting in a separate high chair) like the rest of the family. I love that this booster comes with waist straps. We don't use the tray because we just push my son't chair/ booster seat up to the table.
B003BEDAY0|1|Looks nice, locks in position way to quickly.  Bottom springs were poorly attached...had to restaple springs...could not get Shermag to return my calls about repairs.  Best to stick with a USA made glider!
B000XT30G4|5|Great for dog control
B001DF7LIK|5|This worked great for when we needed it. It is kind of embarrassing to have your child on a leash but it is better to be safe than sorry. We used it in Rome when our daughter would yank her hand out of ours and sprint away. We have only used it a couple times since. Usually in large crowds. There is just a tiny window where this was so necessary for us.
B00C0TBARQ|5|My baby boy is in the 85% percentile for weight, I tried other baby seats, and he's legs always got stuck.  This seat is great. He is secure and comfortable.  It straps onto one of our regular dining chairs and we use it as his highchair for now. It is also very easy to wipe clean.
B00SHLZY8W|5|Excelen service and product
B00F2MQ258|4|Very Good
B00GCYTNYM|4|I LIKE IT
B00GSMU63U|1|This stroller was an epic disaster from day one.  Let me preface this by saying I replaced the stroller with the Joovy Scooter and am a very happy Joovy customer now, but this stroller is a nightmare.  Heavy.  Bulky.  Awkward.  Difficult to open.  Difficult to close.  So long you have to be extra cautious crossing streets and turning corners.  Difficult to get into the basket.  Most scary is it folded in on itself twice while I was walking with both of my kids in it.  Luckily I was not alone either time and neither child got hurt (though it was close).  Joovy replaced this for me when I called to complain and they were a wonderful company to deal with.  The stroller for me was just not a good fit at all!  The scooter in my opinion is much more practical and fun :)
B009ZU3TQ8|3|Ok
B001MUOK26|2|This is a nice carseat but had to clean it today...NIGHTMARE is an understatement.  Will be putting a towel between my son and the cushion from here on out.
B006PB2H36|1|Terrible gate. Would be cheaper and better to buy the wooden ones at Walmart that are about $10. Doesn't matter how many times I would try to extend it to make it fit better in the doorway it still isn't stable. Its fallen on my two year old multiple times. Its useless and a waste of money!!! Do NOT buy!
B000056OUH|3|Very easy to use, but don't feel that it is a must have.  All baby's need to develop their immune system and therefore I feel a good hot water and soap cleaning does the trick.  Have only used the sterilizer once, my baby is now 4 months - hasn't been sick yet.
B001DDMFI8|4|This is a great pad and stopped our son from sweating sleeping on his Naturepedic mattress.  However, it is a bit of a loose fit and he can definitely soak through it when sick.  However, we have the naturepedic mattress, so we can just wipe that off.
B002EVOXLK|3|I am 20 years old and I love Zebra print stuff. I bought this chair and a regular chair to comfortably sit in, I was completly unaware that it was made for a child until I recieved it. I was very dissapointed, for $119 I figured I was buying a big girl chair. I had no clue and had to return the item.
B00295MQLU|5|You try pumping without one of these! With my first baby I had a one-boob-only pump and didn't buy a bra like this, but it was still really tough to do anything at the same time, cuz you have to hold the shield there with one hand. For baby #2 I upgraded to a double-boob pump (which is awesome) and holding two shields in place becomes impossible!<br /><br />This bra is completely adjustable with the removable front center panel and the super strong velcro in the back, and washes beautifully. It also holds the shield firmly in place, and doesn't sag or anything when the bottle fills up. I pump into 5 oz bottles but usually fill past the 5 oz mark so it gets heavy. And it leaves your hands completely free. Yippee!<br /><br />Don't wear this as your bra though. It'll look weird under your clothes. Just wear a standard nursing bra, then undo the boob flaps and put this on over it to pump. Don't bother using the arm straps that come with it. It stays in place just fine.
B005UTRYWI|5|Nice average size basket to hold my yoga mats in our gym. Not floppy. Good buy.
B00318CLS2|3|This is a great looking cup and my son seems to pick it because he can see what is in it but he has a tough time getting his drink out of it. I tried it and it is pretty tough. We purchased the Thermos FOOGO cup with the straw too and that one is much better.
B00AO083M8|3|I would recommend this swing for travel use or to keep at grandparents' house or something, but not for every day. It just goes through too many batteries. I have to turn it up all the way for my 4 week old, so I don't think it would be great for an older baby. The swing itself is very nice, and a breeze to put together.
B00ANJLSTA|5|easy install with detachable straps.
B000HK6BCE|5|We just moved our daughter into a full-size bed and these guard rails fit perfectly on her bed allowing her room at the base of the bed to climb on/off. It was an easy assemble and I love that the rails can be pushed underneath the mattress if you don't want them up during the daytime. Great item for the price!
B00L4MJEC8|4|Product works well, came 1 day later than expected.
B00440D01S|5|These worked great. They were durable and easy to clean. Would buy again.
B00029HJIK|5|This Moses basket worked great for us!  My son slept in it until he was about 4 months old.  It's inexpensive, comfortable, and a great bassinet solution!  You can even use a receiving blanket tucked around the mattress as a sheet instead of buying specific fitted sheets.  And this basket fits into any standard rocking stand.  This also doubles as a travel bed if you're driving out of town, because it's so portable that you can bring it along with you and have the baby sleep in a familiar place even in an unfamiliar city and hotel room.
B001TJEDQS|5|Feels soft and easy to carry around, with sun protection and small bag at the back. The baby had fun traveling with it.
B001WAJVZM|5|I was very happy with this product. I bath my baby in the kitchen sink and I put it on that sink handle. She is a wiggle worm in the tub and it has kept her from poking her eye or face. I will use it in the bathroom tub as she gets older.
B004GEC8LU|5|excellent
B00005V95L|5|My daughter is now 6 months old and still loves this toy.  I took her to BRU when she was about 2 months old and went to the section where all the Lamaze toys were and held each one in front of her to see her reactions.  She got all excited when I held this one in front of her and didn't stop playing with it until I had to give it to the cashier to ring it up.   <br /> <br />I love how easy it is to attatch to her infant carrier.  We take it with us where ever we go.  She likes the sound the ears make the best.  I recomended this toy to my cousin who is now 7 months pregnant.
B00DQL6CIE|1|I was really excited about this dispenser when I found it on Amazon.  It's a great size for the diaper bag.<br /><br />However, less than two months after I purchased it, the clasp broke so it didn't stay closed. The wipes all dried out.  I tried to make it work and taped it closed.  Then the whole flap broke off!<br /><br />Anyone know of a travel wipe dispenser that won't break?
B001E5CE22|5|I bought the car seat for my 3 month old grandson, his parents are very pleased with the car seat he fits in fine and it is easy to use.
B009P7631Y|5|The baby is very comfortable it. easy to clean and i also like the color it is company has choosen to make it available
B005EHNL3M|1|The latching mechanism that holds the entire rail in place is a little pin on each side.  Maybe it's just the particular rail I received, but the flimsy little pin became loose on one side almost immediately, and won't reliably stay in place. This means that the rail may pop out of position and fall outward from the bed, definitely NOT a good safety feature. I can only rely on it if I brace the rail with an end table next to the bed.  Definitely not what I was hoping for, and I wouldn't feel comfortable using it when I travel with the kids either, for the same reason.  I've already replaced this with another brand of rail.
B009WPUMX4|5|it's works well
B00512QO5M|5|I had already read in the description the size so I knew it was smaller but it looks greats and holds all my collars and leashes.  Its so cute.
B000058DP2|2|Like many of the previous reviewers, this stroller was fine for the first year or so that we owned it.  My husband and I went to the store and tested every single stroller-car seat combo and went with this because it was light, easy to open and close, and very easy to get the infant car carrier in and out of.  I am now expecting my second child and have to get a new stroller and I will steer clear of anything Graco at this point.  First of all, you cannot reach the basket underneath while the infant carrier is in position or when the regular seat is in any reclined position.  Also, it is difficult to get the seat to remain in an upright position no matter how tightly you pull the tethers in the back.  And lastly and most importantly, after about a year of use the mechanism that unlocks/locks the stroller in an open or closed position became extremely unreliable.  More than once I have struggled in a mall parking lot trying to get it to stay open or to close it and more than once I gotten so disgusted with it that I have considered leaving it in the parking lot.  Save yourself a lot of grief and do not buy this stroller.
B0000A1O7P|1|Be careful to figure out if this is compatible with your table. I had to return it because it would not work with our table.
B00QTXYETA|5|Must have
B004LE7FVS|5|Way more durable, padded, and attractive than others I have seen. Great purchase for a girl or boy. Also doesn't show dirt or spills.
B003G2YUS2|1|I give this one star because zero is not an option. This is a complete piece of garbage. It would not transmit 30 feet, let alone the 500 (!) it boasted on the package. Perhaps if you need a monitor 8 feet away from where your baby is it will work, but I doubt it. Not only will I return it for a different brand, but it is so worthless I hold nothing but contempt for the company that would market this as a useful product. So, Fisher-Price, if you're listening, you've completely polluted your brand in my eyes with this horrible product. You'll not get another penny of my money. Is your business model to take advantage of first time buyers? Pathetic.
B001P9QO3C|1|Cute toy and my son enjoys it very much.  However, when I received the toy one of the arms was not attached,  It appeared that someone had cut it in half.  I am assuming a previous person received it and tried to cut through the bag and cut the arm as well.  Was not happy with this purchase because no one that purchases something should have to do repairs.  I was able to sew it on my own since there appeared to be no more in stock and it was a few weeks before Christmas.
B0000A1O7P|1|It doesn't fit on most tables with a lip, I should not have ignored the reviews. It doesn't seem safe to me. The holidays were so busy that I forgot to return it, so I'm out the $21. If you find yourself at Ikea, get a cheap back up high chair for $20 there, and just store it unassembled.
B00295MQLU|4|This hands free bra is made very well and could put up with multiple daily uses. The only thing I did not like about it is that it is super tight and would cause the pump to dig into my breast while pumping. I could not get it adjusted to be secure without causing it to be too tight. It was either too tight or too lose, but it worked.
B004NNUMEE|1|Purchased this item 6 weeks ago. Came with a broken zipper and I am still trying to get a new one.
B00FYOENMI|5|took forever to arrive. the pattern is bold and attractive. they are very absorbent
B006WLDKUI|5|This seat is built strong. We have had it for over two years and it still looks like new. We bought it because of the side impact protection. When used with the latch that it comes with, the seat does not move, making it very secure. Removing the cover is not too complicated, which is great to clean up the bad messes such as throw ups and pees. The harness is very secure as well.
B000KW1MI2|3|I don't care for the Boppy pillow but I felt bad giving the boppy cover a bad review. It's a good cover doing what it needs to do but not impressed with the Boppy Pillow at all. Read my other review if you're interested in why.
B00JALYDVW|1|I really like the seat but my three year old granddaughter is to short for this.  The seat belt hits her in the face, plus i wish it had a safety latch to latch into my carseats.  I really dont feel safe with this one. Maybe if your child is taller or older it would be OK  :(  not happy
B000BTNLBK|5|Perfect! Soft, comfortable and warm!
B0024S7JI2|5|I use this in my wet pail for cloth diapers.  i just spray one spray on top.  I think it works great.  i make my husband use it, too!
B007MP5MMC|5|The opening is small but what I do is stretch it out with my hands before taking it on & off & it does the trick. I've been using these for months now. My son is 7 months & is the 90% in growth. I like these instead of the Velcro which would scratch baby's neck at times. I bought 3 dozen. Since they're white I add bleach from time to time. Love their comfort!
B00STTQUQ2|5|Great quality. Looks just like it did in the pic. I research products for hours looking for items made in the USA.
B00KGIQYEW|5|Love this little pillowcase. Will be ordering more.
B006ZIST3G|3|I bought this car seat when my son was 1 year old and he is now 3, so I have used it for two years.  I have not had many significant issues with the car seat and in general it has functioned well.  I never used the rear facing option so I can not speak of that aspect of this seat, my son has always been front facing.  The seat is somewhat difficult at times to strap but once you get it latched it works well.  I have had to have others help me when I have had to remove the car seat and my husband frequently gets frustrated when he has to install this seat.<br /><br />My son is on the taller end of the spectrum and now we have it adjusted as much as it can go......he weighs 38 lbs and is 40 inches tall.  He is not old enough for a booster yet.<br /><br />The main only draw back is that the fabric is very, very difficult to remove for cleaning.  I have spot cleaned it thus far but my son is now potty trained and pee'd in his seat.  It needed to be removed for a washing.  I spent a significant amount of time forcing the cloth cover off and the part at the bottom which buckles does not fit through the slot at all.  I had to slightly cut the covering to get it out and that was after almost 30 minutes of trying that particular part.  If you have a toddler who is older I would find one which would be easier to remove.
B000056C86|5|this play pen is great.  it is sooooo easy to pick up, transport, put up and put away.  we have used this at the park, tailgating for football games, and as a bed when we went out of town.  my daughter actually learned to take her first steps in this pen.  highly recommended.
B003BEDB26|4|My mother bought me this glider for my baby's nursery. It shipped quickly, matches my nursery wonderfully, and is true to the online image. My only gripes about this chair are that the assembly is rather awkward (lots of nooks and crannys that are difficult to fit screws into) and the instructions are TERRIBLE but luckily I am handy enough (in spite of the fact that I am 9 months pregnant) that I was able to figure it out without much trouble.  Also, I can't figure out the lock mechanism on the bottom of the chair, I dont know if it is broken or if there was a step missing in the instructions.  Over all, I love the chair and if i had a second chance to pick a different one I definitely would'nt change my mind. I can't wait to rock my new baby to sleep in it.
B003KW8HSW|3|I loved this crib bedding set sooo much! I set it all up, and made our little girls room around this bedding set. Sadly, I just washed it and I want to CRY! The quilt now has a hole in it, which it can be fixed, but the stuffing from the inside all went to the middle of the blanket. Very SAD!
B00ZPXILD0|1|Completely flimsy. The suction cups work well, but as soon as the outside heat hits it, this sign just wilts and the sides fall back leaving the sign illegible.
B0000AHOYF|5|I love this carseat. It is truely easy to use even when using a lap/shoulder seatbelt. It has its own locking clip built in the side. It's comfortable, my child can fall asleep without having a crocked neck. The cover comes off easy for washing. Easy to belt your child into. hands down the best!
B00IXXYYQC|5|I am so very happy with my purchase of the lillebaby all seasons! I have chronic back pain and over the past week we have done many day trips where I carried my 20lb 6 month old and had no back pain what so ever! My son loves that he can face out and see everything. It is easy to put on and take off. The only negative I would have would be that you need to remove the carrier to change the seat width, but that's a very minor issue for me.
B003ZPHXNO|1|I bought two of these and both fell apart. One the side split and the other, the buttons fell off. Very cheaply made.
B000AKPE6U|4|Overall this is a great seat, much better than most of the other seats out there.  I have one in my van and one in grandma's van. Very simple to take off the cover for cleaning and to put back on. My 4 year old daughter says she is very comfortable in it.
B003BNY9O6|3|Wish it stayed softer after washing.
B00FK599DE|5|The all in one piece is tricky to clean, but I've started using a nipple cleaner after I wash the best I can with a dish cloth and they get clean. Or I put in the dishwasher if it's ready to be run. Works every bit as well as name brand. Highly recommended!
B00474TZD8|1|The lid on this product is very different than other cups by the same company.  It is almost warped and is difficult to line up the threads when putting the lid on.  I would not recommend this cup.
B00CHR025M|4|Great for a newborn because it allows you to changed the diaper without undoing the arms. My son managed to kick out of it by week 3. Also would be better if you could put it in the dryer.
B003ZFPRHS|5|My baby loves this adorable turtle tud thermometer, especially the light which indicates the water temperature. The light catches my baby attention, she loves playing with it even though I put all her favorite bath toys in front of her. This product is perfect for me so far. It indicates whether time for my little sweetie to finish her bath. I just left her sits and plays in the tub until the light turn blue :). And another thing is the light automatically shut off when the water is off the sensors, this is good thing as it saves battery... Good product, I would recomend
B004FI2P88|3|Suck to install  Then again all versions do. Once installed they work as they are supposed to, I like that you can 'turn them off'
B0044R7I1O|4|The product does and supports as advertised<br />- the only thing about this is they cookie cutter the pieces and they don't always fit together as we'll as they should so there is kinda a gap with the lower support rods that and the seat back pushes the side braces out
B00P4TO4F4|5|So far I love the necklace!  Looks beautiful and I feel good knowing the closure is sturdy and won't just pop open while she's wearing it.  I can't yet attest to the helpfulness during teething.  I'm hoping that having her start to wear it before she starts teething will prevent the uncomfortable symptoms she may have!
B004A15YTC|5|I bought this crib for my daughter, and I love it. The quality is excellent, and the crib is sturdy but not too heavy.  It looks really pretty and fits perfectly in our small nursery.
B00GR9FHNI|5|Great for rentals. Stick the latches to doors, cabinets, or toilets. It works well.
B007N5RLS4|3|This ball was okay but my grandson prefers the round Wiggly Giggly Ball.  It has louder sound and more enjoyment when rolling across the floor.
B000058CC7|4|This gate really does operate hands-free, which was terrific.  What was not terrific is that my barely two-year-old daughter figured out how to open it by herself - defeating the purpose of the thing.  Although others have said the weight of a two-year-old would not be enough to open it, my girl (50%ile for weight and height) could stand on the pedal and lean on the gate to get through.  Just an FYI.  If you've got a resourceful young toddler, he or she may find a way to operate this gate.  By contrast, she never could figure out the gates that required one hand to operate them.  Lost convenience, yes, but in the end we couldn't go hands-free without sacrificing the safety of our daughter.
B004C053C4|5|I'm already a fan of their bottles and since my son is getting older and eats more, the 6 months nipples are a great upgrade and the price was decent.  My son had no issues taking to the comotomo bottles from the start.
B003REAPE2|5|This is perfect for new parents who are willing to try a remedy in the middle of the night when you can't get ahold of your pediatrician.
B000WUF4LS|5|Our daughter can climb out of the hook on chairs but not this one.  It folds down nicely so it is compact and she loves the little toy.  I'm not crazy about how the tray snaps on but they all seem to be that way.  very happy with this!
B004X0WBHS|4|Toy was bigger than I thought it would be. Came nicely packaged in the box and all. Like it says in the name it clacks and makes sounds, keeps my little one entertained. She loves shaking it I'm just afraid she might hit herself with it since it's so big. Otherwise it's a thumbs up for us.
B004GCJMUW|4|Last year we purchased the Uppa Baby G-Luxe after debating between that and the MacLaren Triumph. It is a great light weight stroller, slightly flimsy, but we knew we were paying for the compactness. That stroller did not hold up very well to a year's worth of daily use. Disappointed, I started looking into another lightweight umbrella stroller a few weeks ago. I looked into the Inglesina Swift/Trip, Chicco Liteway, MacLaren Triumph and the Peg Perego Pliko Mini strollers. Two factors convinced me in favor of the Peg Perego: Lightweight (13 lbs or so) compared to some of the other ones (we live in a walk up) and the fact that the stroller can stand on its own when folded.      I received it two days ago and was immensely pleased at its workmanship. It feels really nice and solid, the opening and closing mechanism is super easy, not to mention smooth. Nice wide canopy, wide stroller but yet narrow enough for NYC doorways and good sized wheels. It must have something to do with the fact that Peg Perego brought back their manufacturing to Italy. I have always associated Peg Perego with big, bulky, non trendy strollers that I see on the subway. But the Pliko Mini has definitely changed my mind.     The reason for my four stars is that I am concerned about the brakes for the rear wheels and the swivel lock for the front wheels. They seem kind of 'plasticky' - I wonder how well they will hold up to daily use. But only time will tell. Thus far I am pleased with my purchase.
B000M4FEFA|5|I got this pail reluctantly since there were so many terrible reviews about this one and most people praised the diaper champ.  I got it because I was able to get it free through a work incentive program, so i thought I'd try it out.  Now that i have it, i would have paid the $50 or so for it.     My daughter is 3 months old now and I haven't had to change the batteries yet.  I can use the target stretchy grocery bags in it... i'm sure you can use others but those tie the tightest when i have to throw the diapers out. I love the touch free aspect so you don't have to let go of the baby on the changing table to throw away the diaper.     As far as the smell goes... there is none! We are in a small apartment and have it in our bedroom and haven't smelled the dirty diapers once.  However, when we went to visit a friend who has a baby the same age as ours.  We used their \\"diaper champ\\" and both my husband and I noticed that their diaper pail smelled bad and didn't like having to reach over to turn the handle thing.     Some other negative comments people have made about it are that you have to empty the diapers frequently. I only have had to change it every couple days at the beginning when you change a million diapers a day, and now that we're changing diapers less, i probably empty it once or twice a week.  Besides, i don't like to have dirty diapers sitting in my house a long time anyways.      I've noticed that this pail is not available at BRU or Amazon anymore, I am glad we got one and I hope they show up at the stores again soon.
B00EL8S3TW|1|The speakers hiss constantly, so I can't even hear my child. Why would you buy a monitor just to listen to hissing white noise all night?
B004C053D8|5|Very good products, good quality, very fast delivery speed, very satisfied.
B002UD65XQ|4|great product, can't complain..its hard to put on, but what isn't..
B0017UWDFC|5|Our son started playing with these at eight weeks old and he absolutely loves them! We used linking rings to string these across his crib, which doesn't pose a choking hazard because he can't sit up yet. He loves to spin each item, especially the clear ball with the fish and the turtle with the mirror on it. We also attach other toys, like his Kringlering, so he can play with those. Great baby toy!
B000WFPWUQ|5|This is my child's one and only &#34;Lovey&#34;.  It is a must have for comfort for her.  It washes well, is compact, and extremely soft.  We have bought three look a likes for the times in between washes (and day care).
B00BEVF1VC|5|I do not write many reviews, but I feel strongly about this seat. Britax in my opinion, has always made quality seats (we are moving from a Marathon to Frontier), and one of the huge things for us in addition to safety is ease of use.  Compared to the other brands I have installed and used, there is really no comparison.<br /><br />There are several things that I love about this seat in particular:<br /><br />First, as many other reviewers have mentioned, it is insanely easy to install. I am currently 35 week pregnant, and was able to install the seat in less than a minute.<br /><br />Second, it is heavy which I view as a good thing. It's solidly built-and the materials are of high quality. Luckily, i have not had to clean it yet, but the cover can be removed with taking out the seat, and the material seems to be pretty easy to just wipe off for smaller spills.<br /><br />Finally as far as car seats go, it just looks good. Furthermore, I feel better knowing that my son is as safe as possible in that seat, plus he loves the cupholders for his toys.  This seat is rated to be used for 9 years, so thankfully it will be our last purchase!<br /><br />I do have one minor criticism--it creates a pretty significant blind spot in my car.  I think it's more of a car issue than a seat issue, but it's worth mentioning.  I drive a 2007 Honda CR-V, and it completely blocks out my far back right window. I can work around it, but living in an urban area with 5-7 lanes to navigate across, it can make driving a little nerve-wracking at times!
B007A2ZQQY|1|I was hoping that the other reviews were wrong and they were being used incorrectly but when we got these and my husband put them in he was easily able to just pull them out.  The turning lock didn't work.
B00CUEBGU2|5|gift
B000HGBTPM|2|Nice looking, but not well engineered.  Bolts did not fit well and the item is not as sturdy as it could be.
B00CXWIL6I|5|Amazing addition to the nursery! Decals were very easy to put on and also re-position.
B009R56U76|5|Works great for on the go! Have had no issues and has come in handy while I have been outside my home.
B003OH0W90|4|This worked well getting a Graco car seat to fit with my Bob Motion Stroller. My only problem with it is it's bulky and I was traveling with it via plane. When I collapsed my stroller to check at the gate I had to carry on the adapter as it's not small enough for the basket of the stroller. Other than that I had no problems getting the car seat attached and detached from the frame the entire weekend I used it (the car seat was borrowed.)
B00SHO2SZG|4|Fast and fairly accurate
B000058DIM|1|This machine is a complete waste of money!  It produces so much humidity at one time that the entire machine and its surroundings get sopping wet!  We tried putting it on our babies dresser and it left a huge puddle of water everywhere!  You definately get what you pay for in this product.
B0007CS4EU|1|Lids don't close easily.
B001QIH7QA|5|We purchased this balance bike for our 2 year old grandson.  As soon as he saw it, he abandoned his tricycle.  This bike is high quality, was easy to assemble and our grandson loves it.  He's already starting to coast on this bike and pulls his feet up to do so.  He'll soon be riding a real bike and that was the idea behind buying this one.
B000N351VM|2|I love how this booster fits in my chairs and my daughter thinks it is very comfortable, but BEWARE...There is white text on the bottom of the booster and it has rubbed off on my leather chairs. I managed to remove it from my chairs the first time, but the second time I couldn't get it all off so now you see white text on my chairs. I tried covering the text on the booster with clear packing tape, which worked pretty well until my toddler discovered it and kept ripping it off. Now it sits in our garage. What a waste.
B000P635T2|5|Totally works! Keeps my kids out of the craft closet so I won't wake up to paint all over the walls and marker on the carpet again ;)
B00KRJWNDQ|5|Is perfect !!!
B004MDL5VO|4|Love this stroller, it is good quality for the price. It does not lie as flat when folded as some and honestly it is not as easy to open as a top of the line model, but it isn't $200-$300 either. if you are looking for a reasonably priced stroller that performs well this is it. plus, it is cute as can be!
B00CV3NN4E|3|it is what it is,,,,,,,they work pretty good....seem a little cheaply made but it is what it is....great price for
B0080D59Y6|5|I love that you can take the cover off and wash it.  Also, it's made for safety.<br /><br />I like the that the top tray comes off for washing.
B007NG5UF4|5|excellent monitor no background noise 5 star great communication<br />highly recommend<br />best ever purchased do buy works as reported very good
B0013FGWD0|3|Once installed, the bumper is effective for what we bought it for -- our 8-month-old is rolling around the crib and getting her legs stuck in the slats. We didn't want a traditional bumper, so this fit the bill.<br /><br />However, it's clear from the instructions that the product you receive is not exactly what's pictured. The instructions themselves are absolutely terrible. The photos are too close-up to show any context at all. The verbal directions are clumsily written and vague. Fortunately, it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to install it.
B000TFMIMY|3|I bought 3 of these when my daughter was born in 2009. I bought a couple of replacements and my daughter completely shuns them. The fabric is slightly different and they now have 2 tags instead of 1, which is apparently very important to a 3 year old. If you don't have the older version, then I recommend these. They make great lovies. My 5 year old still sleeps with his which are the giraffe version. Very cute and soft.
B004IFGCPA|1|Poorly made.  The hat didn't fit.  Eye holes were on his hairline.  Cheesy cheap product.  My son is 21 m old and is small for his age and it barely fit him
B000G7WU50|2|Okay, first, this thing looks a million times cooler than those duck ones.  I was really excited about a functional item that looked cool too, but I was disappointed.  I expected the design to be more evolved- there are a few major flaws.  My 10 month old son can (and does) easily pull this off the faucet.  When he does that, the door to the bubble dispenser pops open and all of the soap comes out.  Additionally, the bubble dispenser door pops off easily (choking hazard?)  I wouldn't buy a duck, but I am pretty disappointed with this product.
B00LVMSU0S|5|Smaller size but perfect for the space we have. Easy to set up. Nice to look at. Our 8 month old doesn't mind playing by himself for short stints so long as he can see us :)
B00N19USWW|5|Bought as a gift.  My son and daughter-in-law love it.
B005DEWDSK|4|I ordered two of these for my twins, Great product for the price! I love that they don't take up a lot of room in my tiny kitchen. They were very easy to set up, (a definite plus when you have to set up two). I love that they fold down easy for storage, so I can hold on them for many years to come. Even though they are collapsible they are very sturdy.<br />My only complaint is that the removable/washable tray is pretty tough to take off and to put back on. Also trying to get the entire tray onto the chair is a little tricky to get it lined up just so, but nothing I can't work with. Overall I am very pleased with this product, and I would recommend it!
B00PEJ9JC2|5|Love love love!!!!!!!!
B00JM8DANU|3|Very cute.
B002WT2XHK|5|I use this pillow to keep between my (bony) knees at night. It's the perfect width and silky and cool to the touch. I need to get another one for when I travel! It's also handy to prop under my head when reading or browsing my ipad. It's so soft and sikly, I'm sure babies would love it!  **I have relied heavily on reviews for years, since I do most of my shopping online. I've finally starting trying to return the favor by writing reviews of products I love. I hope my review was helpful to you!**
B0009JOSNM|5|Great design with safety and comfort in mind.  Certainly much much better than other baby carriers we've used and our baby is quite a heavyweight for his age but this harness makes it much easier to go on shopping trips/long walks.
B000LXQVA4|5|I purchased this for my Grandson, He has really enjoyed all the features. Would defiantly recommend.
B0058K5IIQ|5|This play mat is exactly what I was looking for. Large, easily rolled up and put away, lots of colors for my baby to look at, and SAFE. She can sit on it and we don't have to worry about her toppling over and hitting her head. She is learning to crawl on it, as well as just some play time. Compares very well to the Dwinguler mat that costs a lot more.
B002WYKJTY|4|Easy to put together, all parts and directions included. Beautiful crib and the trundle is a bonus for sheets and blankets. Can't wait to put the little one in.
B0038JE5Y2|5|These freezer trays are great for freezing pureed baby food. Easiest to remove frozen food if you slightly overfill each compartment.  I freeze the tray, then flex the tray and empty all food into a ziploc bag for later use.  These are also very easy to clean.
B008CDCKP0|3|Very small! Pay close attention to the sizing as I didn't and was a little disappointed. But overall it is a great product and cute.
B004FMAMNY|3|I just bought this to replace my Bjorn, which is starting to hurt my back when I carry my 15lb nine-month old. I purchased because of the similarities to a certain well-known, more expensive brand... as this one is much more affordable. Upon first inspection, I love the lumbar support, and the padded straps. The back clip was really hard to buckle by myself at first, but then I realized the buckle can be slid up a few inches, making it easier to reach over my shoulders. I was able to put my 35lb four-year old in it (though he looked ridiculous) and felt pretty secure. However, my baby seems to be a little too short, as the top of the carrier hits right at his cheek when he turns to look around. I can't imagine what a younger baby looks like in this. It seems like it would swallow them up and there's no way they'd be able to see out to look around. I'm going to hold onto this until he's a bit taller, as I think once his head comes up out of the carrier it'll be great.
B00QWVMW0W|5|Perfect for storing expressed breast milk when going out or road trips. The temperature stays nice and even for several hours, and the size is big enough to store a couple of feedings. Quality product.
B00CWN3JT2|4|I love this mobile because it is well made, cute, and soothing. No complaints EXCEPT that it really does require a traditional crib setup with wooden bars. None of the descriptions stated this...we're using a Pac N Play for sleeping - and there is no way whatsoever so attach it. We managed to hack the thing a bit and get it hooked onto the back of a chair which we set next to baby's bassinet. World fine then, but now with the PnP and his nursery setup, it's going unused. We're transitioning to a crib soon, and can use it again then, but the setup will still require a pretty big gap since the mechanism for attaching the mobile sticks out a good, jabby 6&#34; from the back. Lovely mobile, but wish it were constructed & attached different.
B009UQPSE8|4|I wanted a nightlight for my daughters room that gave her light but was safe for her to touch, incase she ever did. This does not provide enough light to see clearly, but it is enough to help a young child feel safer in the dark. It also provides me comfort knowing I don't have any bulb of any kind constantly burning in her room.
B00M2M4G68|5|Very fast and simple  setup.  Grandson loves it and tries to grab the monkey's on the mat.  Looks great and at a very reasonable price.
B003VRB69I|5|I use Fuzzibunz, Charlie Bananas, and Bumgenius 4.0's with my daughter.  I'm not that crazy about the Fuzzibunz and love Charlie Banana and Bumgenius, though if it came down to it, I think Bumgenius would be my pick between the two.<br /><br />Bumgenius 4.0 is so easy to use--my husband won't use the other two brands because he finds the three snap systems on Fuzzibunz and Charlie Bananas confusing.  I also love the absorbency--my daughter can go all night with no additional doublers.<br /><br />A lot of people have complained about them being too large.  They are big diapers, and it's true that they can interfere with the fit of clothing, but in terms of leaking due to the large sizing, I haven't had any problems.  My husband and I started my daughter in her Bumgenius diapers at 7 lbs, and even with them fitting her a bit large, we almost never had any leaks.
B00ATIJ6F8|2|The plastic in the back have the material to thin
B00186YSU8|5|I read lots of reviews before ordering this tub since mine was getting too small. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!! My baby is 3 months old and the first time I bathed him in it he kicked like a champion swimmer. Then he went to bed and slept for about 9 hours straight!!! That is a rare occasion and a very welcome one. I am now going to bath him every night to see if it works the same :) This tub may not work well for tiny babies, but I could have used it when my baby was 2 months old for sure. It's a keeper.
B000LSL5ZK|5|I tried several types of spoons, and these were on the very bottom of my list. I didn't like the way they look like toothbrushes (and that still bothers me). But these are ALWAYS the ones I get out of the drawer first when going to feed my daughter. LOVE LOVE LOVE them! They have long handles, deep bowls (vs. the shallow Nuk spoons), and they are very eye-catching, which can sometimes be a problem--baby would rather play than eat. :) I thought the Nuk spoons would be better because they're smaller, but I found they are a bit too small. All I can say is: Don't waste your money on other spoons...these are all you need!
B0050GD2AO|5|Great stroller!! Very good quality,easy to clean, lightweight, comfortable for the child,and rolls great.
B00198PQHY|5|He didn't pay attention to it when he was 1 month old, but now he just love it and &#34;talks&#34; to the toy all the time!
B00GRS9XEI|5|This is a great activity center. My nephew was thrilled when we put him in it. He bounced and kept reaching for the toys. He was squealing and laughing the entire time he was in the toy.<br /><br />The activity center is very colorful and it comes with a its own toys. The toy assembly was fairly easy and fast. Every part seems to be numbered so you can actually put it together without mistakes (very important to me). It also comes with 5 toys and the seat has a pad in it (important for my nephew's comfort).<br /><br />I liked the color since it looks like a lady bug in its colors.<br /><br />If you are space restricted then this might not be the toy for you. It takes a lot of space.
B001C6QM9Y|2|We used the old (with BPA) bottles with our first and liked them although we did experience a little of this same leaking with them.  When I read some reviews talking about leaking for this new BPA free version, I thought maybe it would be the \\"small\\" amount we experienced with the old ones.  As it turns out this is much worse and has become very frustrating.  I prepare 3 bottles each night for day care the next day.  On a good night one out of the three will leak while I am shaking to mix the formula.  On a bad night, more than one of the bottles will leak multiple times even after unscrewing and screwing the caps back on.    I have tried everything I have read about how to prevent leaks and nothing works so those that say \\"people that are experiencing leaks aren't using them correctly\\" must just be getting really lucky.    The one thing I like about these bottles, and the reason I gave it the two stars instead of one is the one piece venting system.  I like that there is less to clean and I have always felt that the venting system does a good job at what it's supposed to.    Now that I have invested I don't even want to think about how much cash on the 15 bottles we own I will just suffer through the next 4 months but perhaps I can save someone else from this misery.
B000H846T6|3|These are very cute and work great but you cannot select the color you want.  I got a pink set that says Daddy's Girl.  Also, you can find these much cheaper at your local dept stores.
B00DTV1IL2|1|I hadn't had the bag for a full month and the strap popped. I did not weigh the bag down either, the strap just didn't hold up
B0081S5SFA|5|Good fun! Better than giving just a gift card or money!
B004OXI6TQ|3|Really big
B003D3ML44|4|Extremely nice furniture. I only gave it a 4 because the door on the end was a little<br />challenging for my hubby to get on but once he did it was great.<br />Also it scratches easily so be careful when putting it together
B00CWN3JT2|5|good product
B00F2MQDU2|5|Excellent
B00EJ6MUJK|4|I had been looking for an affordable changing pad cover for a few months and the Trend Lab Chevron Cover colo great. The colors (Levi pattern) are vibrant and as pictured and have maintained through at least four washes thus far. It fits our Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad perfectly however, as others have noted it did shrink a touch but I find once I've put my son down on it the shape conforms and works fine.
B00WHO5SWW|5|We bought this pillowcase to go with the Little Sleepy Head pillow. The case is high quality and matches well with our daughter's room. It also washes up well. We are going to buy a second one to have as a back up. We also appreciated the personal email we received from Chris, the company's president. This is a good product and a friendly company. We would purchase from them again!
B005VT1022|5|I used these corks as decoration for a wine party I had over the weekend.  I put them in a couple wine glasses and scattered them around.  It looked great.
B004M0WRLE|5|I bought this a christening present and it is soooo soft! I wanted to cuddle w/ it myself. Pretty decent size too--plenty big for my one year old niece to use.
B00MC8GQ3I|5|This backpack is ridiculously cute on my two year old. It's just the right size and very light weight. He loves being a dinosaur when he's wearing it.
B002JOPRQC|4|My son loves this pacifer and my daughter had one just like it too. Its large enough for their little hands to hold onto and easy to clean. They look really cute holding it. The size of it also makes it easy to keep track of and find. The nipple snaps off easily for cleaning.
B005AUYEHA|1|Would you want to be carried around by your crotch all day?  Neither would your baby.  Try an ergo or a ring sling.  Babiea should be supportes from knee to knee, not hanging by their crotch.
B003N0JXSO|2|I wanted to love this soap. I had high hopes of it removing the barnyard smell that seems to plaster itself all over my son's cloth diapers. I have tried varying the amount of soap I put into the wash, increasing water usage with each wash, changing water temp, etc. but this soap just doesn't seem to get the diapers clean enough. And it's not some other culprit, like letting the soiled diapers sit for days on end, oh no, I wash those bad boys daily and they still stink. Like a port-o-potty at a carnival type of stink. It's nasty, and this soap just didn't meet my expectations. Not even a little.
B00AJFHG8A|5|I was really skeptical about using these pouches. I didn't think that they would make much of a difference. I was WRONG! My 9 month old son LOVES them, they are also a LOT cleaner than using a spoon. I plan on purchasing more pouches in the near future to have different varieties of food on hand :)
B004BU3CDW|5|I think these worked just as well as the original ones that came with the set we got from the hospital. I know they are generic but it's not too difficult to duplicate plastic and this manufacturer did a good job in producing these membranes. I really feel they were worth it. I think we only used 2 of the 8 membranes but it's still a much better deal then buying the ones Medela sells. I recommend these if you are not afraid of buying generics to save some money. There's nothing to be afraid of in buying this product because it works just a well as far as I could tell.
B000P007FI|5|Lifesaver. Saved my banister.
B00JKER4N8|3|Took a month to get here.  Very cute.
B006YZWYRM|4|Love this with one slight exception (that hasn't affected the use)....it has a tag near where I lay my head.
B001GBJOK4|5|My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the blue horse being one of them. He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his \\"wubbas\\" (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.    The wubbanubs are very easy to clean (the blue horse, being a lighter color, does tend to show dirt more than the darker ones) and they have been very durable. I highly recommend Wubbanubs!
B00CSAWIMS|5|very good
B00081L2SU|4|Works as advertised
B00M1WECUE|3|We don't use medication with our children often, but I want to be prepared and know that I'm successful at administering it when that time comes. This syringe fits that purpose for me with my 10 month old. My favorite aspect of it is the easily readable measurement markings on the syringe- they are in ml and teaspoons, so you don't have to find equivalents. It's heavy plastic and BPA free, so it feels better than the disposable ones that come in a package of medicine...but I don't feel that it performs better than those. The plunger is stuff and hard to push. It doesn't work as quickly as I'd want it to, when dealing with a squirmy baby! The adapter is a great idea, but it'd probably be cheaper just to use the syringes that already come with the medicine you purchase. I received this product free of charge.
B0002JETOW|5|I have several dogs and like to keep them in various areas of the house. Also up or down.<br />These gates are the easiest to install that can be swung to the side. Now I can keep the dogs away from the garage to<br />house door till I get items and myself in. Then can swing them open to take groceries or such in without risking them going out<br />of the garage. They look nice and could even be painted I imagine to match a wall. They also can be moved to another place by putting<br />in some extra screw eyes. And they are portable for a trip. Fit the bill for me!
B000ZG2JH6|5|My baby is almost 4 months old and he has had this since 2 months.  HE LOVES IT!  I can reach back in the car when he is crying and turn it on and he winds right down.
B004V8VQC8|4|My 3 month old son loves this toy. It will occupy him for up to a half hour at a time. My biggest complaint is the toys that come with the gym. They are hard plastic, which is not ideal for a 3 month old who just bats his hands at them. If I took them off the gym, they couldn't do &#34;double duty&#34; as a teething/ stroller toy. The lion that comes with the set doesn't do anything (doesn't rattle, squeak, turn, etc) - it is just a lion made of hard plastic.
B003AOHU5Q|3|The knob was nice, not an exact match for the paint color of our furniture, but I can not hold that against the product, as there is no way for it to be a perfect match.  Whe I did not like was the size of this.  It is HUGE compared to the other knobs that I was replacing.  I ended up not using it.  it made the dressed look like it belonged in a cartoon or kids TV show.. not our babies bedroom.
B005CNEQK0|5|Great and sturdy! Works with our Diono!
B001T6AOXM|5|this was a great seat at a great price. Better than what other places were offering. timely delivery.
B0052QYLUM|5|My sister and her family seem to be really enjoying this product!  I was pleased when I tested it right out of the box.
B00GUN3Z1W|5|I can't believe the quality for the price I have been using for months and not one issue
B008H3T5SA|5|Very impressed with the stroller, delivery etc. Great purchase for our daughter in law. Very easy transaction and she is really pleased with how lightweight and easy this stroller is to operate.
B000I8WNT0|4|The only thing I don't like is that if your LMP isn't on Sunday, it kind of messes with you.  Also don't like how when you are 10 wks 1 day it shows you at 11 wks.  I understand now, but was very confused at first. All in all its good.
B003XMWFBE|3|This is a very convenient organizer for vehicles but the seat straps are too short for larger vehicles. Therefore it just sort of hangs in our truck from the headrest and moves around quite a bit. But I do like have the extra pockets and dividers for sorting and storing everything on the go.
B010KOBPEU|5|I tried this product since I received a promotional discount.  I had the old suction type car sun shades that stick on windows and roll down. They never stayed in place.  This is an Excellent product.  Works exactly as advertised .  Very easy to use and stays in place. Can move it around to block sun while driving.  Great value!
B001EQ66WK|5|Bought this for our 5 year old.  We've taken it on several trips now and it's a very sturdy product.  She sleeps very well on the bed.  Sets up fast and the travel bag that comes with it is nice and sturdy.  Highly recommended.
B000A7V1EM|3|This chair is a great idea... in theory.  However, it's way too complicated to clean (you have to take it apart and machine wash the fabric part), and it gets filthy after about 2 uses.  This means you'd need to wash it approximately every day!  I'm not a germ-o-phobe, but for anyone who is, you will definitely not like it!  Contrary to the description, this fabric is not easy to just wipe clean!<br /><br />My other complaint is that it definitely doesn't work with all tables.  We have a fairly standard kitchen table, and it almost didn't work for us.  We can only hook it onto the ends of our table, not the sides, due to supports under the table that are too large to get the chair around.<br /><br />What would make it better: If the seat were truly made of some easy-to-wipe-clean fabric OR if Chicco made a good cover for it that could be removed and wiped clean.  Having to take it apart constantly to wash it is definitely not acceptable.  Please, Chicco, make a cover!
B000MXQGT4|2|We ordered the Contempo because of space saving factor.  However, we were disappointed up on receipt of the product.  First, the seat material is very thin and cheap.  It does not offer much cushion/comfort.  Second, the seat portion itself does not protrude out enough in my opinion; add to the fact that  there's no adjustable foot rest, my 6 month old ends up sitting with her feet dangling (she's 90% in height in her age group) and with the edge of seat putting pressure under the thigh rather than behind the knee area.  She was visibly uncomfortable after 5 minutes in the seat.  We returned it and ended up purchasing the peg perego siesta instead.
B0002PR43O|5|My 7-month-old son really enjoys playing in this toy.  He has this one at grandma's house and the Einstein at home.  He got bored of the Einstein and it's useless puppet quickly and fusses when he is in it. Not in this one.  He get's so excited being in it.  He loves the book.  I haven't had any problem with durability.  A friend gave it to me after her son outgrew it and everything still works.  I can see where it can be overstimulating for a baby under 4-months though.  My son didn't get it until he was 5 months.  I don't even think that babies under 4 months should be forced to sit in such an upright position anyway.
B00B8OB1S2|4|These bags are great for not wasting bags in lunches.  They don't seal as well as plastic though, so if you forget about something in one, kiss it goodbye because now it's stale.  I've also noticed that they can get discolored because they're cloth, but that was my own fault for leaving strawberries unattended.  Overall a very good product.
B001H0GF24|1|Purchased this gate and it was delivered broken, when I called Evenflo they were very rude and would not help at all since I didn't have the date the gate was manufactured. Bottom line - the gate was broken and the customer service was terrible.
B001HASCNY|4|I own three of these and I'm here to buy one more today.  These are fantastic!  They are very secure.  They are best used to block a standard door way and yes, as the other reviewer stated, they can take paint off the door frames, or leave a darker circle where the pressure mounted 'feet' (white round circles at the left and right side of the gate) meet the door frame.  A small price to pay for such a secure fit. I also own two metal North States walk through gates (great, but very pricey) and two North States adjustable 6 panel plastic gates, which allow you to create a 'pen'.  I'd say that these wooden ones are the ones that I use the most.  They are so handy and I can do it with one hand while holding a baby in the other.  I have two toddlers (including one active boy who gets into everything - thus all the gates) and two dogs (including one active puppy who likes to get into everything as well!)  The price of these have increased though, because I bought the other three in 2011 for less than $15.  I ESPECIALLY like that these are shorter than most baby gates I've seen, especially for a non-walk through gate.  I am 5'2\\" and have no problem stepping over them from time to time.  (I have one blocking the bathroom doorway, but leave the bathroom door opened so I can watch the kids playing and I am easily able to step over the gates.)  The plastic is solid and none of my three have yet to rip or crack yet.  The wood is quite strong and none of the three gates that I own have split either.  Great gate!
B004S8ZW58|5|I had one of these for our infant carrier and it worked great! Added extra padding and kept the baby from being all sweaty. When we switched to the convertible seat, we didn't have one and it was winter so I didn't think much of it but even in the winter, my poor little guy is so warm when I pull him out of the seat! Now that it's gotten a bit warmer, I've noticed he is super hot. Put the liner in and no more sweaty baby!! I know that people are hesitant to add things to their car seat because of it voiding the warranty but this is one thing that is def. worth it! I don't feel that it makes the seat unsafe in any way. Get it, try it and see for yourself it really is worth it, enough for my very cheap self to have bought one for his infant carrier and 2 more for his convertible seats!
B00F7NHXY6|5|Excellent product and if you have stokke stroller the blanket attaches well with side clips to it so it doesn't fall.
B008KW8IX6|5|This chair is just the right size for our 16 month old granddaughter. Now she has her very own seat in our living room when she visits! I did use scotch guard before use so if we have accidents, easier to clean!
B005V09ORY|5|The price is what drew me to choose this chandelier over the others I was looking at. It's absolutely adorable! I purchased for my daughters nursery and I couldn't be more pleased. Adds the perfect touch.. I also purchased a 16&#34; ceiling medallion to mount with it because the ceiling mount that comes with is is just a small plain white metal one.
B00081J3N6|4|These are clear. Most plugs went on smoothly, very few were stubborn.
B00ISS2S6A|5|I love this car seat! Let me just say I have had a maxi cosi pria, recaro pro ride performance, and a britax boulevard clicktight and this by far is my favorite! My son is going to be 1 on February 19th and he fits in this seat great. He weighs 25.5 lbs and there is so much room for him to grow. The other seats seem to work for now but he doesn't have much room. At first I was worried about size but I honestly don't think its that much bigger than my other seats! The seat is heavy but so is my britax! I like when I know my son is safe so those things don't bother me! No complaints here.<br />These pictures are in a 2015 Nissan maxima!
B00KXN59OG|1|The tube is too thin.  I would buy medela instead.
B002Z32N46|5|My son and I absolutely love this head support pillow. My son doesn't fuss anymore on long trips. It keeps his head cool unlike other head supports that I've used. I couldn't have asked for a better product. Go moms!!
B003IXNUS0|3|I bought this for my 2 yr old. She would hold on to it for a minute then let go and take off. This would be good if you needed this for a child that is mature enough to stand by your side but doesn't want to hold your hand or if you are holding another child. The quality is good. It comes with a carrying case. The product is nice and is exactly what is advertised, I just didn't find it useful.
B00EVRT6LM|5|Been working well for three months now.
B005ZBI04M|5|I got this seat for my grandchild's visit.  It worked as expected.  It fit a regular toilet seat and the best part was it did not slip at all.
B004ECJWK4|2|I'd like this thing if it would stop breaking. I've purchased 2 now and both have snapped in half after a few months. I'm on the hunt for something similar but sturdier.
B000GEAKNM|5|Works great. Stays in place no matter the shape of the spindle and easy to use. Would definitely recommend for banister stairs.
B0000789TK|5|If you are flying alone with a small child, you should not go without this.  It's a tight fit, but it works.
B000O7SR18|5|A VERY NICE SOFT AND COMFY CRIB SHEET FOR YOUR WEE ONE. FITS MY PORTA CRIB VERY NICELY. EASY ON, EASY OFF.
B00J9NVZZI|1|Even though there are more positive reviews than negative ones honestly, please don't waste your milk and your money on this brand.<br /><br />- Too stiff<br />- makes milk leak out on sides of your breasts<br />- messes up suction, its weak, too weak it breaks the suction away from the breast.<br />- makes hissing noises<br />- my 3 year old valves suck harder than these stiff things from this &#34;maymom&#34; brand.<br />- cheap plastic<br /><br />Best just make the effort and go to your nearest babies r us or whatever and buy Ameda brand because ya get whatya pay for.  For sure.
B000LSL5ZK|5|These are great.  I love them.  Now, if only I can find them in my house.  Where did he hide them? This is also a toy for my 16 mo. old toddler.
B00BSG2BLG|4|I like it but it is much smaller than I thought, doesn't fit a lot of stuff but its a nice bag.
B00T6ZG6I0|5|This item is great! I am very pleased with my tray. It's size has made it my favorite tray out of 3 I have for batch cooking and freezing. I pop out very easily the frozen food and store them in freezer bags. Every few days I pull them out and put them in a feeding container in the fridge. I would love it if they offered containers and a fridge store system similar to others since the tray is by far my favorite out of the 3 I have. Their service and tips have been amazing and helpful. I am a very satisfied customer.
B005NK10E2|5|I have yet to connect these two cameras to my monitor so I can't report on them specifically, but I am happy with the Safe n'See monitor and have never had a problem with the two cameras I already have been using for the last eighteen months.  Hopefully these cameras will work just as well.
B006PB2AO2|5|Perfect for second car, or if you found a used carseat online (just make sure to check the expiration date)
B000UCV2SC|5|After doing my research and not feeling right about putting my 3 year old in a booster seat, I purchased this seat.  He is sooo comfortable and has plenty of room to grow into this wonderful seat.  After riding in a booster for 2 months, I thought I would have trouble getting him to ride in it. He was exciting about his \\"Super Big Boy Seat\\" and adores it. He also uses the mesh pockets as his cup holder and they work perfectly. Yes this seat is big but it fits perfectly in my Pacifica's captain seat. I have piece of mind knowing that my preschooler is safe.  Bulk and heaviness is a small price to pay for your childs safety.
B00CP78JV8|4|It is a good crib
B0084TZOP0|5|So glad I purchased this, works great for pumping in the car
B002F9MUX4|5|really like the warming food this way just did not care for the fact it does not come aprat too clean inside the well
B001I481LM|5|This baby is a life saver!  I didnt like having to shake the bottles individually so this made it much easier!
B004G8QSY4|5|My son loved this turtle starting @ 4 months old. It kept him occupied while sitting in his chair while I was tending to other things on the room. The lights and the music always entertained, this was the first toy he really enjoyed. He is 10 months old now and still loves the turtle.
B002YRKWB4|5|Just what I ordered!  This was a gift and the receiver loved it!
B00BDCNPCY|5|We're on kid 2 and seat 5. This has been, by far, the easiest one I have EVER installed. Seriously, click and push, done. I was skeptical at first, but that bad boy is in there snug. Doesn't hardly budge. I have bragged on this seat to all of my friends who are needing to trade up their infant carriers.
B0035JL93K|1|These fell apart in the wash right away.  They never held any pee.  Do not waste your time or money.
B002UXQM02|5|This is the ONLY bottle that my 3 month old breastfed baby will take. He only uses MAM pacifiers, and after trying 6 (yes, six) other brands of bottles, and my return to work a month away, I ordered this (boo for not being carried in stores!).     Part of his resistance was probably stubbornness, as I think we gave him too long of a break before reintroducing the bottle (about a month of no bottle), but I also think that other bottle nipples just weren't cutting it for him. These have a natural shape, in my opinion, and the texture is soft, like the pacifier.     The multiple parts don't bother my husband and I at all - I think it makes them easy to clean out. We haven't had any leaks - always make sure the bottom rubber valve is placed properly and the nipple is fully in the collar.     I'm keeping all of the other bottles we purchased in our arsenal in case anything changes in a few months, but I'll be ordering more MAMs in the meantime!
B002VBXY40|4|I got this for my son after he started sitting on his own (around 5 months) and he really has enjoyed it. He is almost 2 years old now and still plays with the little toys on it. He has always loved the &#34;piano&#34; part of it. The seat never moved around very easy and he wasn't a big fan. Also, there is no way (at least that I saw) that you could fasten him in and once he reached a certain age (I think just over 1) I had to take it off because he did not like it and would try to get out and fall if I was not paying attention.
B001O9F6M8|1|I normally never leave reviews but felt it necessary to warn others about my experience with this product. I'm the father of a 3 month old baby. A couple weeks ago I put him down for a nap in his swing, with his head resting in this pillow. I was on the computer and noticed his arms flailing really fast, he didn't make any noise whatsoever. I ran over to him and his mouth was completely full of saliva, veins were bulging out of his forhead, his eyes were swollen and watering and he the most horrifying look on his face I have ever seen, he was drowning in his saliva and obviously in a lot of pain. I was able to grab him, pat his back, and get the saliva out of his mouth. Of course as a new born he has spit up many times, but he has never had anything like this happen before.  He has never choked on his own saliva like this for that long. And I have never seen him look like he was in that much pain.<br /><br />I began to brain storm of why this would happen now, and the only thing I can think could have caused this is the fact that he can't move his head to the side in this pillow. Before using this, if he had spit up in his mouth he could move his head to the side and let it drain out. This pillow prevents him from doing that, it props the babies head so his face is straight up and makes it really difficult for him to move it to the sides.<br /><br />I just thought I would let others know of my experience. I wish I would have known about this before buying this product.
B0038JDVCY|5|I love this bottle brush. It was worth every penny just for the stand! I loved that I had a place to put it so it wasn't just strewn around in the sink area. Highly recommended!
B000H6R15O|4|Love this feature. is so great to just carry the car seat around. But I feel like it's so expensive. We only used the infant car seat for 3 months.
B00014PLAO|1|Peeled right off even though we followed the instructions to the letter. Disappointed but at least it didn't damage the crib coming off.
B00EEDKDOM|5|I had an unpadded Maya wrap with my first child and loved it. It was a little awkward at first, but I got used to it quickly and could carry her around all day comfortably. I was also given a baby Bjorn, but never used it because it just wasn't as easy, portable, or comfortable as my ring sling. I heard great things about the Moby wrap, so I purchased one while pregnant with my second child, since I no longer had my Maya Wrap. I was also given a peanut shell sling. I figured that the Peanut shell would be good if I didn't like the Moby. I HATE the Moby! I thought I would get used to it, but after a month and a half of folding and wrapping, I gave up on it. While the peanut sling is easier than the Moby, it's still not as easy, secure, or comfortable as the Maya. I Finally gave in, and purchased another Maya Wrap. I'm so glad I did, the lightly padded one is even more comfortable than my first one, and my baby likes it much more than the others we tried. I definitely recommend a ring sling to all new moms. It's my most valuable baby item.
B002MXP3SM|5|i've been using these for the past 7 months and they're great. they bear quite a bit of weight with my heavy diaper bag and seem much more stable than some other hooks i've seen. i use two, one on either side, to hold my diaper bag. very sturdy and reliable so far. also, the velcro attachment makes it easy to put on any stroller. we have a slightly atypical frame on our stroller (quinny senzz) so i am glad i got a more flexible hook.
B001KYSY76|5|This Maya wrap turned around my life! My baby will not nap more than 20minutes unless she is in contact with me. We were both sleep deprived and I was desperate when I finally ordered this. I had tried my other baby carrier, but she screamed when I put her in it, and I didn't feel close to her. This wrap is so simple to use, easy to pack, and I feel close to my baby. When I put her in it, she sleeps for hours! I don't know how I will ever get her to nap in her crib.
B005SP2LWW|3|hard to get tight enough by yourself to hold the baby secure
B00LVGXUXQ|5|This is a well-built gate with a nice finish; I definitely recommend it.
B001IACJQ4|5|Loved it, very comfortable
B00CWN8IK2|1|We bought two of these. After less than 3 months of use, both leak substantially from the bases. One was on a real wood dresser and the finish is ruined. If you risk this purchase, place it in some sort of container to catch the inevitable flood. All in all, super disappointed and do NOT recommend!
B006K0UD6U|4|the adhesive doesn't stick, but the screws provided work well.
B004FLL7HA|4|The umbrella stroller works well and is very lightweight making it easy to use, especially in stores since it can actually fit through the aisles. It also folds up very small (for a stroller) so it's easy to store. My one and half year old uses it as a play stroller as well. I got the monkey design,which is very cute and playful.
B001E87FQY|5|I ordered this becuase my newborn has to use this so I didnt know that Amazon has thoses so I am glad I ordered. Thumbs up
B003VTZKOI|1|The seat is just a piece of fabric no cushion. The adjustments are so minimal it seams like you barely moved it. The walker is too tall for a 3-4 month old and I have a very tall baby. We returned this item and went to Babies R Us and bought the cheapest Babies R Us brand it is was way better than this one and cost less.
B00JRYS3FE|5|Good afternoon friend , I wonder if actually includes baby carrier + the choche , ie , the two articles that appear in the pictures published
B00D3EWJQI|4|I used this camera as an addition to the BB3521 set. The camera quality is pretty clear; I personally have not tried to take a picture with the monitor yet, but I'm assuming it would be low resolution. There is a delay in the P/T function of the camera, as is with most mid range cams. My biggest complaint would be that when you use the digital zoom, its as if the camera has to reset itself. It delays before zooming (X2); more importantly when you zoom in you have no idea where you are. It does not zoom in where you were originally centered, and I find maneuvering in digital zoom mode tiresome. For comparison, we have a 5 yr old Summertime baby monitor set, and when you zoom in it zooms in immediately where you are looking.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Smooth white blends in with the background of my white wall.<br />- Still viewing of camera is quite clear<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Zoom is horrendous<br />- Lags when Pan and Tilting<br />- Power cord is a little short<br /><br />Overall, still good enough for its use!
B00BXE5NWM|3|I got these for my toddler when he was weaning off of bottles, but unfortunately he didn't seem to like the shape/hardness of the spout. The bigger issue was that he figured out how to open the lid rather quickly, so these weren't a good option for us to use on a regular basis anyway. They're cute and were very affordable, and I have friends whose kids use them without any issues, so I guess it's just YMMV, as with many baby products.
B00NGN9SK6|5|Great large soft blankets. The designs are a bit odd looking, but the baby couldnt care less about the designs.
B004J69U98|1|If you have a very calm child who will gently flip the bowl, the product will remain in the bowl, otherwise, it's a waste.  The food gets caught in the sides of the bowl and prevents the bowl from twirling when makes it a regular bowl.  I would not recommend anyone purchase the gyro bowl. There are a bunch of youtube videos demonstrating how non spill proof the bowls actually are.  Here are a few.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]
B00H8MQB8S|5|My mom bought me this set for my wife and mines first baby and we could not be happier with the purchase.  We were initially going to go with a Britax model that we both really liked.  The only problem with that one was the base for the case seat was absurdly big.  It wouldn't fit in my Corolla let alone my wife's Scion XD.  I guess our cars were too small for the Britax base. So, we headed to Babies R' Us so we could try and find a replacement with a base that could fit in our cars.  We tried a number of them but didn't like the style or didn't feel like paying 600 dollars was within the range of sanity.  We honed in on the FastAction Sports set and loved it.  The base fits amazingly in both our cars with plenty of room for the person who is in the seat in front of the baby.  Installation was a little bit of pain, but that isn't surprising as weaving a seat belt through the base with any car seat can be a bit of a hassle.<br /><br />The stroller.  As I am not very good with putting things together, I found the assembly of the stroller to be incredibly easy.  Insert an axle, snap on a wheel, and put the cover on.  I followed the directions and it took me three minutes to have the entire stroller together.  We love the stroller to.  The front wheel works great and allows for sharp turns in narrower situations.  The stroller is light and easy to carry, and even my wife has no problem lifting it in her her fragile state.  There are a number of sun covers that come with this model which is nice.  Also the car seat snaps right in and pops out incredibly easily.  We have tried other models and it seemed like you had to hit three buttons and really give it a yank to get out.  The stroller releases it nice and easy.  The fold action is really awesome.  There is a little red strap that when you pull it, it folds up really quickly.  There is a small basket on the bottom which is handy although do not think about holding really heavy things down there.  One thing that I reallyenjoyed is as the baby grows the stroller has a built in neck pillow  that, I think, will really help the baby when they are sitting in the stroller.  Some people may not like it, but I do, and that is the way you adjust the pitch on the back of the stroller.  It is with a draw string that pulls it up or allows it to go down.  Very simple to use. One negative, and it's a small negative, is that when the stroller folds up, it isn't as compact as other models.  You will need a bit more space then some other models, but less then others as well.<br /><br />The car seat, as we found out later, is one of the best when it comes to safety and I can see why.  It is incredibly sturdy and well padded.  The harness, if that's what it is called, is perfect for a child from newborn to between 30 and 35 pounds.  The adjusting straps in the car seat are simple enough to handle and adjust to the size you need them.  It also pops out of the base with one button and is very smooth.  What I really like about this though is that there isn't 45 places for it to attach.  There are three locking clicks, and when you  hear those three, you're good.  It's a very smooth and easy transition.<br /><br />I've seen that there are a number of accessories you can purchase, which we have not because we do not need them.  The only one that we purchased was an extra base for my car, as it simpler to just have a second base to drop her in when we are traveling in my car.  We got it on Amazon for 45 dollars, a small purchase in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Over all, we are very happy with our purchase and would highly recommend.  If you have a smaller car, like we do, we've found that all the things that are included in this travel system fit really well without inconveniencing the passengers of the car.
B00AH8IZJI|5|After trying many cloth diapers, this is THE ONE.<br />*Price- cheapest cloth diaper I have found.<br />*The inside lining keeps away moisture very well.<br />*I like how the snaps align and stay together but are not hard to open when baby is fussy and you are trying to hurry.<br />*Available in lots of nice patterns.<br />*Holds up very well for washing, I use the sanitary cycle and have had no problems.<br />*I like the leg elastic, it is tight enough to not leak but not so tight it leaves red marks (like the BumGenius ones did on my baby, although the overall shape of this diaper is very similar to the BG)<br /><br />I'm reading a lot of people had problems with the leg elastic leaking. I had that problem at first, and realized that it was: 1. His legs were too skinny, and I had to wait another week to start cloth diapers. (at their snapped up smallest, they are about a size 2 diaper) 2. He was a heavy wetter and I needed to change my stuffing/inserts. I personally put one microfiber insert in the pocket, and a bamboo insert on top. Once I fixed that, I have not had a problem with leaks.<br /><br />I bought my full diaper stock from another site after trying one that I got on Amazon. Found them for much cheaper. However they are shipped directly from China, so they take awhile to come, but so worth the savings.<br /><br />Best cloth diaper I have tried, I highly recommend it.
B000H1MRJO|5|Perfect for travel with little ones
B0043C5XYY|5|I love Bamboobies! I was using disposable nursing pads. Bamboobies are WAY better. You don't have to feeling guilty about creating trash everyday. They always stay in place and are so comfortable. And they are easy to clean. I'm completely addicted and recommend them to all my friends.
B006WAF1WO|5|Great item. Great seller!
B008P8EZOG|5|This product works great even at noght and it lets me watch tAlk and listen to our baby. I get more And better sleep and he is safe. Highly recommend. GreAt price too
B001AZKWA2|1|Thought it was a full size for the price but it it only big enough to cover a kitten not a human baby. Go to the store a buy a blanket for the same price....
B00P0A6OM8|5|The shades are staying up...even in the hot garage.  We love them. Thank you.
B0006FHB5Q|5|Bought two of these to put in the tub/shower as an assist for our aging parents. Easy to install and they've remained steadfastly in place for several months. Was initially skeptical that these would hold, but you can't beat them for the price.
B000GGD3O8|5|We got this gate for our front door which leads to a couple of steps. Now that our daughter is crawling/cruising and almost walking and with summer temperatures rising we wanted to be able to let her explore the house safely and be able to keep the door open.   The gate is easy to install and fits very tightly in our door frame (so much so that we didn't have to screw in the cups to make it a permanent gate. The standard gate extension that is included with the gate will make it work for pretty much any door frame so you only need to order an additional extension if your door or opening is extra wide.   The bars are close enough your baby can't go through but still leaves you with a view.  We love the auto-close features, very handy when coming in/out with both your arms full.   The downsides:  1) you have to watch your step when using it so as to not trip over the floor bar  2) you'll have to show everyone how to use it, the opening mechanism is easy to operate once you know how it works and kids will never figure it out, but it will take an adult some time too if you dont show them.     I would recommend this gate, well worth the price.
B007A3GU72|5|The bag is very roomy and sturdy. My wife wasn't expecting it to be so big but I'm glad we got it. Even though it would be for the other kids we don't have yet. :)
B004OR1DVA|1|I honestly can't find a use for these. They definitely DO NOT stay put. Aside from putting things in them and holding the bowl in your hand away from your child these have no benefit for feeding a child. If you put them in reach of a child they will simply push it around or just pick it up, I would definitely not buy these again.
B00164WSVI|5|I still have not give this item to my daughter-in-law as her baby shower is not till November.  But grandma opened to see how it looked.  And it is what I expected.  Thanks so much for the fast service!
B000BOLLJE|1|when i used this bottle warmer in the car... it would keep turning off for some reason and the bottle would never get warm because i had to hold the sleeve against the bottle and keep it upright so the warmer would stay on.. needless to say i only did this a few times. i wouldn't waste your money
B001PBFWMO|3|Nice product. Didn't suck as hard as I needed it to. My son loved the button that he could push and listen to it play lullaby' . It was easy to clean and the battery lasted a long time. I used it for a few months but not as easy to use as I expected.
B001X9INMY|5|I bought these as well as the connectors to use with my Hygeia pump.  Hygeia takes so long to ship orders plus the flanges don't disconnect from the connectors making them difficult to clean.  I needed flanges immediately, so I opted to go with these.  They work perfectly.  There are a couple of difficult spots to clean, but other than that, they are great.
B00K5KVC52|5|Loooovvvveeee!!!! I stand out with these and they're just perfect!! No one has these where I live so it's great for bragging haha
B001FBO7F2|5|These cards were the perfect gift to give to our niece and nephew.  The package says for 0-12 months, but our niece is 2 years old and this was still a great gift for that age range.
B00028XJNA|4|Easy to use, great for storage the milk, it helps to save space on the fridge. (Be aware that the amount of milk in the bags is not the same on the bottles).
B00FG9LYY6|2|I wanted to love this product. I have a five year old who weights 39lb. My issue and his was the foot bar. his feet would hit my back as we walked. Needs to be remodeled for short Mommies with tall sons.
B006I0R4MS|5|This set of toddler dishes was perfect for our little one's first vacation. The best part is the silverware. I actually prefer this set of forks and spoons to any of the more expensive permanent ones we've purchased. They are the perfect depth and size for our 15month old. She eats with them very well.  It was an added bonus that the sippy cups were able to take a few drops/rolls without leaking any juice. We definitely won't be tossing these. They hold up quite well for multiple uses.
B001PEXRC8|5|Perfect cover for storing a crib mattress.  It was easy to slip on, durable, and just what I was looking for at a great price.
B000UO8HM4|3|These are cute on sight but FADE VERY VERY EASY.  I would suggest removing them as soon as your occasion is over And keep an eye on your child's skin as my daughter got black rings on her arm from hers.
B000BNQC58|5|Our first born loves his turtle.  He has used it for years and hates to sleep without it.  Two thumbs way up!
B00J4FYCY2|1|When I got it the package box was all banded up. And didn't come with batteries.
B002SG7JSK|5|A couple of years later and it is still sticking on our glass table.  Soft and one of the. Enter edge protectors for kids
B00GY8J8GO|5|Easy to put together!<br />Reclines nicely but likes to recline ALL THE WAY BACK without support...obviously needs to be installed in the car so it has a back support when using the entire unit which is what I'm doing.<br />We are using the seat with an 8 year old boy of average height and weight.<br />Quality is EXCELLENT!
B00DA3NLHI|5|Love this brand! Needed new lids for the sumo snack holder after the lid cracked. Led was not defective it was obviously our fault it cracked :-)
B001F50FFO|5|A great baby shower gift. She loved it!
B00C7JW3WK|5|Lot of work but looks beautiful and great value. Fits and works well till 30 months
B002G5I0YK|5|The baby loves not having the sun in his face anymore. A wonderful product.
B002U6GB0U|4|I first bought this bag when my son was just a few days old.  If you have ever been a new mom, I imagine you know what sorts of things I thought I needed to cram into my diaper bag every day, so I of course I needed the biggest diaper bag that I could get my hands on.  I saw this pattern at a local boutique and fell in love with it, so I forked over the cash and brought it home.  To my dismay, I couldn't fit all of the things I needed in it.  I was so disappointed.  I used it a few times and ended up hating it so much that I contacted Petunia Pickle Bottom and arranged an exchange for a different bag.    Fast forward to a few weeks later:  As I got used to my baby and started to learn what I really needed to carry out of the house with me, I realized that this bag would have been more than adequate- in fact, I exclusively breastfed for the first seven months, so it actually was too big for most day trips.      Pros:  -It's huge.  I mean, massive.  I had at least the following crammed in there:  A dozen newborn diapers, a container of wipes (not the black wipey case that comes with it, an entire container), two extra outfits (winter ones, at that), two pairs of socks, an extra shirt and nursing bra for me, a nursing cover, 2-3 burp cloths, 2-3 flannel receiving blankets, a small wool blanket, a snack and bottle of water for me, my wallet, my keys, my phone, my iPod, a travel packet of tissues, a tube of Desitin, hand sanitizing wipes... I know there was more.  The thing was crammed so full that the Velcro was almost bursting (and I say almost because it's super strong Velcro so it held tight).  -The patterns are even more beautiful in person than online.  I actually think this particular one is a bit masculine, which is ok with me because I'm not really into super feminine stuff, and the few times we did use it, my husband wasn't embarrassed to carry it.  -It could totally double as a laptop or school bag.  Just a thought, in case you are hesitant to drop the cash onit.  -It has a bunch of pockets- not useless pockets thrown in just for pockets sake, but really useful ones that are perfectly sized.  -I love the backpack straps.  My shoulders slope downward a bit, just enough to be annoying, and the backpack straps allowed me to carry the bag without having to constantly hike it up.  It comes with a long shoulder strap and two shorter backpack ones.  -The material is waterproof and wipes clean really easily.  -It is super high quality, you can tell by the feel of it that it is constructed well.    Cons:  -This particular bag is the glazed material, which while beautiful and waterproof, it quite heavy.  If you feel one of these bags empty vs. one of the same in a brocade, there is a noticeable difference in weight.  It may not seem like a big deal, but once you get this thing crammed to the hilt, another pound or two could make all the difference in the world.  -The straps are a slippery webbing material, kind of like car seat-belts, and it contributed to the shoulder-sliding thing I mentioned.    -It doesn't come with stroller clips (Valet Clips) and I know for sure that the JJ Cole ones do not work with it, I'm not sure about other brands.  I ended up with a few other Petunia bags, so I have the clips now, but it was a pain to try to loop this thing around the stroller handles.  -When it is packed really full and you are wearing it with the backpack straps, it doesn't really lay nicely on your back, it kind of tugs and gaps.  If you take some of the stuff out and have it packed to a reasonable level it lays flatter.  -I hear a lot about the Velcro being really loud, but it didn't bother me at all.  The Velcro is nice because if you have so much stuff in it that you can't get the zipper closed, then the Velcro will keep it all contained.       Overall, if I had to go back I would not have returned this bag.  Now that I am bottle feeding and carrying around snacks and toys in addition to bottles and food and diapers and wipes and fresh clothes and everything else, I think this would be the perfect bag for all-day trips.  I wouldn't take it for a quick trip to the grocery store (see Petunia Crosstown Clutches, there is a reason I own three of those), but it can hold the stuff your little dude/dudette needs for a long day away from the house, all while you look totally fabulous.
B00LK5J73U|5|Easy to install and a great mirror.  We bought a couple of different ones and this one is working the best. It is great because our middle seat does not have the head rest, but we can put this one on the side head rest and still see our little one really well.
B000TDZQ5M|5|Looking for a mattress for our 2-year old's toddler bed, and this is perfect.  Nice and comfy.  No issues.
B00846OIL4|5|Excellent for my newborn! I've been going crazy with the snot I kept hearing, and this made it possible to clear both of her nostrils! I'm a respiratory therapist, and this is the closest I find to the real thing we use at the hospital. 2 thumbs up!
B0029V28LW|5|Just as described, and a super cute addition to my sons nursery. It saddens me that they have discontinued this line.
B00S02EQPA|5|Love them !! They're very soft and best part not  as expensive as other bamboo blankets
B003I867US|4|We were really happy with this baby carrier. I like that my baby's legs are spread too far apart and the weight feels comfortable on my shoulders. My husband wears it too and it fits him well... Even though he's 100lbs and a foot bigger than me. We have bee pleased with the product and price.
B002DND57M|1|It said it didn't leak and it does very upset sepend too much money for something that doesn't work. Not happy
B00H4BIZNC|5|Well made and very easy to use!
B00NU2U9GU|5|Haven't used it yet but looks good.
B00073HJG8|4|worked as expected.
B00AJSIVWW|5|Our 2nd one because we loved the first one so much. Great booster.
B00ISGWPAG|5|Soooo cute and fit perfectly!
B00171WXII|5|As gross & disgusting as this seems it actually really works! Don't diss it until you try it.
B00MCIYAFO|1|This came with minimal instructions and was very difficult to open the battery compartment with the provided screwdriver. Had to use one from an eyeglass repair kit. I would have returned it but that would  have cost almost as much as the item.<br />There is no way to buy additional patches that have to be worn on it. Don't waste your money.
B001NIZSC8|5|The main reason to buy this type of stroller is because we were travelling on plane with 3 kids (10 yrs, 6 yrs & 2 yrs old). Both of 6 and 2 yrs old old cannot walk long concourses like every other kids. Also because of childs safety we like to keep them close to us. This stroller done the job we bought it for. All the long check-in lines, walk aways to airline we used this stroller.  The stroller is little heavier and bulker and fits only one way on the back side of our Honda Odyssey. But again it is a double seated stroller and it supposed to be big. Also one wheel come out every time when we load unload the stroller. Maybe clip of one side is weak.    One thing we noticed that this stroller works perfect on smooth surfaces like floors of airports & malls. It can be pushed very easily. But not easy to push on rough grounds, roads etc. Also difficult to tilt if you want to go one step high. Getting off and on from sidewalks to road is not easy. Sidewalks are one step high and stroller may not tilt easily.
B002J4U8PW|4|Cute little toy to keep baby occupied whether in walker, high chair or stroller.  I like that it doesn't make much noise too!
B0057IQG4O|5|I am using this same sack for my second baby and it's so soft and comfortable for him. He wears it every night, it's perfect for hot summer nights.
B001MS82HM|1|Initially I thought this was an awesome deal, and it worked great for 2 months until the bottom red button started to just blink. Batteries and plugging it into the wall didn't make a difference. It would turn on still but one side lost its suction. Then a few days later the whole thing just refused to turn on! So I had to run out a buy a different pump so I wouldn't become so engorged. 2 months and broken. For me, what a waste of money.
B008818NEI|5|Got this for my grandson 2 and half yrs old and my daughter says its too cute and has enough room for a toddler's essentials! He loves to wear it on his back per mom.
B00004D3EU|2|This tub would be great if it didn't leak all over.  I have been trying to use it on the countertop for my 10 week old, and half way through the bath, water is gushing everywhere.  It is too difficult to put it in our bath tub while the baby is small, because you [hurt] your back and it is not very safe trying to lift the baby out of the bath.
B002OU6OV8|1|Yesterday I received Carters Super Soft Printed changing pad cover and although it is indeed soft and cute, I am returning the cover because it is defective. Product description and packaging say \\"elasticized for a smooth tailored fit\\". However, on the cover I received, there is only elastic on one end of the cover and there is no way to attach/hold the other end to the changing pad. I think the cover is supposed to be elasticized at least on each end like a crib mattress sheet, but it is not. It could be that the cover I received is simply defective, but I'm not going to order another and take a chance.
B001CW7CVK|5|My older child had one of these given to him as a present...he falls asleep with it EVERY night. It's just part of the routine to 'turn on turtle light'. It automatically shuts off after about 45 minutes - battery lasts for a very long time...we recharge them about once every two months. My youngest son is just moving out of a crib in to a bed and he is very excited to be able to have his own 'turtle light'. Cute, looks good, made well. This makes a perfect gift.
B004I110D8|4|ok
B005QU55EA|5|I run an early childhood program in my home and am required to use cabinet locks.  I've used many over the years, and they've all eventually broken (because they're plastic), and they're all a pain to use and an eyesore.  Until these!  Finally--a simple solution that's not too ugly, not too plastic, and is easy for a grown-up to open (but not for a child).  I love them.
B00FBEN4JE|5|Cant speak highly enough of this thing. I may actually purchase a second in the future. Only thing that might make this better is to have an AC adapter option. We use this even on the crib as it helps soothe baby to sleep.<br /><br />I do wish the music had a fourth (quieter) music option.. it seems even on the lowest setting it's kind of loud considering how sensitive a newborn's ears are.
B00GT5Y4GQ|5|We love it!
B000MNBR2A|4|I chose to write this review in response to all the negative ones. My son and I used this stroller as a jogger (more than 40 miles a week, every week for a year and a half), we regularly used it on sandy beaches and up and down old, stone donkey paths, it traveled across the Atlantic with us 5 times on numerous cars, busses, boats, airline terminals. The thing never gave in. True, the lower basket is pretty much useless except for small, light items. The front wheel did from time to time \\"chatter\\" but it always corrected itself. As for the wheels, well, I ended up replacing all three tires over the course of the year and a half that we owned it. However, they had seen a lot of miles, so its to be expected. I did use a regular tire pump to reinflate. Had no problems with that. I didn't see the adjustment straps as a con. I didn't feel that they were difficult to manipulate. All things considered, this was a very good, reliable, true jogging stroller. It eventually broke at the plastic part where the handle connects to the stroller itself. It just snapped one day going down the old donkey path. Given that this thing had been tossed around like I'm sure it had over the trips back and forth overseas, by the bus drivers, in and out of the car so many times (we generally never went anywhere without it) I feel that it was awesome to get the use out of it that we did. Most importantly, had it not seen so much wear and tear, I'm certain this would have been the only stroller we would through the duration of my son's childhood. Now we have purchased another, different stroller. I decided to give the Joovy Zoom a try because it has the extended canopy and added rain shield as part of the purchase price. That is the one thing about the Tike Tech 360 I would have changed: too small a canopy. I hope the Joovy Zoom is as durable as this stroller and that we are as satisfied as we were with the Tike Tech. For the record, I only decided to purchase the Joovy Zoom to try something different. Its sometimes nice to change things up. All that said, this is NOT a bad stroller. Quite a good one for its price, purpose, and durability.
B008OJ7C6Y|5|This thing is amazing! As a first time mom, I had so much anxiety that I would never sleep again due to the fear of SIDS. My baby is now 18 days old and I can honestly say that I do sleep at night. It was worth every penny!
B004I2QA0U|1|It is big and thick but doesn't absorb water and leaves lint even after washing. Returned it for refund.
B00007LP11|5|I own the Peg Perego LATCH system infant car seat in synergy fabric, in use for 4 mos. About the other reviewers complaints on the `snug' fit &amp; `sweaty' babies...It is supposed to fit snug- you wouldn't want so much x-tra room if an accident were to occur, would you? We felt confident with our son's head positioning as a newborn. Of course then your more apt to get a sweaty baby...I just didn't put a sweater (we live in So. Cal.) on my son, but put a light blanket over him. Yes, he still sweats some, but so does he when he is nursing. About the head rest- there came a time that we just removed it, babies grow fast. Infant seat standard specs: 20lbs/26\\".<BR>Other complaints about the hood not being generous enough- the seat is made to be compatible with Peg's strollers, which the hoods compliment each other perfectly. (We own the ATLANTICO in matching fabric.) Therefore use with the `frame'-style stroller won't give protection from the elements that you may desire. If the hood on the car seat came down all the way...how would they do it from a design issue?...your baby would be in a very tight, dark space. Get a sun shade for your car window...let your precious little one look around.
B001LQCOIS|3|I use my babycook all the time!  Contrary to other reviews, I do NOT have a problem with mold (and I live in a very, very humid environment where EVERYTHING molds).  I just leave the steam lid off so it can dry out when I am finished with it, and make sure there is no standing water inside the reservoir.   I gave it 3 stars as there are a couple major design flaws.  The first one is there is no timer, or automatic shut-off.  You need to set a timer and be there when it goes off otherwise you'll oversteam those precious nutrients out of your Baby's food!    Second, you have to actually hold the blend button to blend, it doesn't have a swtich you can just switch and leave, you actually have to stand there and hold the switch when it blends.  It's not really that big of a deal, but more of a pain in the butt when you have to hold the darn switch on for 5 minutes to puree my 6 month old's food!  This problem won't be an issue when my Baby starts eating foods that have more chunks in it, but for now, it's a pain :(   I do however think it's adorable, I have the color Gypsy, it looks nice on the counter and doesn't take up a whole lot of room.    I would recommend it to a friend, but I'd also check out the competition model of steamers/blenders!
B007UOY5W8|5|These bibs are the best!  They're lightweight and waterproof and protect babes clothes from food and drinks.  I really like that you can throw them in the wash or wipe them clean.
B001DKHPD6|4|This bag looks great and the quality seems to be great too. I did however return it as it was not big enough for my needs. I got the Timi & Leslie Convertible Charlie II Diaper Bag which is amazing. It has loads of space, pockets and accessories.
B002RIII48|1|Absolutely the worst! Waste of my money! The bottle leaks and the bottle doesn't work! Wish I could return but don't want go through the hassle!
B00AM5NTIS|5|I'm loving these pouches. It's so easy to put a smoothie in one and give to my little guy. I love that I can make the food myself and use fresh fruits and vegetables. Little Green Pouches are a really great product.
B004AHMCKA|3|My son is pretty heavy handed so he often throws all of his high chair toys on ground. This was no exception even with the suction cup.
B003UYU0RG|4|I was giving this for a gift and the plastic box that it came in was torn so I had to quickly re-wrap it so as to not look &#34;used&#34;
B000306A3S|5|Our son has been obsessed w/ mobiles since birth that we had to buy a battery operated one for his crib b/c the wind up one didn't last long enough for him.  He used to watch the ceiling fan for hours.  When I saw this I surely had to try it. Unfortunately I didn't find this until he was 5 months but he still loves it even now at 6 1/2 months.  The clip is not really useful but we took that off and use the velcro strap to secure it on carrier handle to our car seat which makes it also very secure so that the mobile not able to come off or fall on our son. We have used this for hours at a time at restaurants, in stores, in the car as the music is also nice if we are in a loud restaurant or just walking around because no matter what, he can hear it. Another great feature is that the mobile pieces have two sides bugs and black/white pictures to avoid the child getting bored.  It is worth every penny and we have used many times and are still on 1st set of batteries (which do not come with) to my amazement. We also use the Tiny Love Stroller Arch with the Sun and this and our son is engaged for hours while we are out in public.  I highly recommend this product and only wish I had seen sooner!!
B004LDDO6Y|3|the socks are WAY too small...not to mention the material is NOT stretchy...impossibly to have gotten on my son EVER..the hand rattles are nice though. he loves to look at them while on his wrists and suck on the little bugs.
B00BLBLR1I|5|Supper quick shipping, great pump!
B0045VA3SO|2|A purchase that I couldn't really use. It fit uncomfortably in the car sear and my child looked like meat inside a burrito
B00012FGA6|5|Works great for all my daughter's stuffed animals. Took about 10 minutes to put up and 5 minutes was finding the drill and bit.
B00FB5JWU8|5|This was a gift for a baby shower.
B00C1ESP9G|1|No, no, and noooo. Such a good idea and so disappointing.<br /><br />First, as others have noted, the cubes have to be pushed in just right or the child is told that the crab she is looking at is a horse that says neigh. I figured we could get around that by me doing it with the twins.<br /><br /> Then discovered the makers couldn't deal with creatures that don't make noise, so they made noises up for them. Instead of just repeating the name an extra time to make up for the lack of sound, the caterpillar beeps like an old-fashioned car--such an amazing feat of nature. Not however, as amazing as the octopus who plays a harp. Since I got these to teach animal names and sounds, and my twins are not yet up to understanding an explanation of real and not real sounds, the multiple creatures with fantasy sounds eliminated the usefulness of two of the cubes. I decided I could live with the sproing sound of the starfish, or three would have been gone.<br /><br />I don't agree with the size being an issue. It fits well in little hands and pictures are large enough to see clearly. Those creatures making real sounds are accurately reproduced. The cat sounds exactly like ours, which always makes my grandaughter smile.

B0001IU5HY|3|I was so excited to get this swing for my three month old.  She has loved her other swing, but is beginning to bore of it.  When I read all the wonderful reviews this swing had recieved, I knew this was it.  I am pleased with all that the swing has to offer, but, I too agree, that the speeds are all too fast!  Even the slowest speed makes me dizzy to watch.  When I read the manual for trouble shooting, it listed \\"speed too high\\" as normal and to fix it, place a blanket under the baby and let the rest drag on the floor!  Nice.  If they could see this was going to be a problem, then why didn't they just build it to have a pleasantly slow speed... you can always crank it up a few notches if the baby likes it faster.  I'll have to see what a few more days will bring.  So far, I think it's a bit overwhelming to her.
B000S8O9ME|2|It keeps falling off the wall.
B003U9V18S|5|Folds compact, easy to clean and very comfy.  The only down fall is that the tray doesn't slide in closer to child so there's quite a gap for my 7 month old
B003VWCYV2|5|In the 90's I purchased 3 of these rocking chairs for grandbabies.  They were perfect gifts. The little ones loved them.  They were durable, tip proof and easy to take on outings.  I was looking for the perfect baby gift a few weeks ago, and found Hoohobbers rockers on the internet.  My great niece should enjoy it for her first birthday until kindergarten.  You can bet one day I'll be purchasing them for my great grandchildren.
B00073HJGI|3|This is a great product a bit small but gets the job done. I definitely recommend this to people with kids and lots of stuffed animals.
B000U02T0E|4|I only cloth diaper during the day with prefolds and shells. At night I use a disposable. These are working wonderfully for my 9 month old son. Absorbent. Soft. Easy to use. Would likely try the &#34;toddler&#34; size if cloth diapering overnight.
B00P0NHER4|5|A little bit darker than what I wanted but still worked
B00H8MSK1Y|5|I shopped for what seemed like forever for a convertible car seat. My daughter was extremely tall when she was born and outgrew her infant seat by the time she was 6 months old (at 30 inches tall and in the 99% for height consistently). I finally settled on this seat and have been very happy with it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Love the latch system.<br />- Fits nicely in my old 2010 Dodge Avenger, and now 2014 Honda CRV. We actually liked it enough we purchased a second to put in my husbands 2013 Dodge Charger. Though a tighter fit, it doesn’t quite touch the back of the front seats, though its awfully close.<br />- No extra supports needed, it has a built in level that showed us it was installed correctly.<br />- Adjusting the height of the straps adjusting automatically is wonderful.<br />- Even without the extra head support, you can keep the insert in the bottom a lot longer. We are still using it for my 10 month old who weighs 21 lbs.<br />- It is a very tall seat that seems like it will grow well with my big girl.<br />- Price was pretty darn good too at around $160.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />- As I have little experience with other car seats, I don’t know if this is a problem for most. But getting her into the seat, up over the sides can be a bit tricky. If we aren’t careful, we can bonk her head off the low roof of my husband’s car. Same thing with removing her. Especially if she’s napping, very difficult not to wake her while lifting her up and out.
B000056OUG|5|The Avent Steam Sterilizer takes up to 6 9oz bottles (with all the caps, nipples and rings), plus an Isis pump.  Uses only 3oz of water (I use distilled water to preven scale buildup from tap water) and sterilizes in just 10 minutes!  Also uses less energy than the Microwave sterilizer, for you energy concious people out there.<br />An essential part of your baby gear if you use any bottle!  Anything that is silicone or rubber can be sterilized in here (as long as boiling or autoclave is recomended as sterilizer method) i.e., pacifiers &amp; chew toys!
B0083973FK|5|These things SAVED my nights! My kids are already in the biggest size overnight diapers and my daughter was leaking every night. She was not a happy puppy in the mornings (understandably). Someone told me about these and now I can easily get an extra hour of sleep because she isn't waking up from being cold and wet. My son doesn't need them, but at least I have them on hand now if he does.
B002U3738C|3|Very cute design but it just didn't fit well over the existing carseat.  The bottom belt with the latch that you click the top two belts into kept disappearing under this carseat cover which was a hassle to dig out every single time I put my grand baby into it.  It may possibly fit much better on a different brand or design of carseat than the one I had.
B0093Y0IJ2|5|Grandson loves it
B000GUZC2A|5|Fun to use toy when my boy is bathing when he was still an infant. However, kids grows really fast, now he is interested in this<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V98HCI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000V98HCI&linkCode=as2&tag=hocivfd-20&linkId=FM6MLJJS6RZPGZZJ
B00L2FPBXS|5|This is a very high quality product with which I was quite impressed. Because this necklace is to be worn by infants, the designer took great care in crafting it in a durable and safe fashion.  The string used is very strong and did not break even when I pulled on it with a lot of force.  However, the string is not the only durable part of this necklace; the amber pieces are strong as well. I was able to bite down on the pieces with full strength and nothing happened. If the string and beads can hold up under the pressure applied by an adult, it will definitely hold up under any pressure a baby can apply if pulled on or accidently chewed on. Other elements aside from the strength of the necklace make this a safe and unique gift. I was pleased to see, as the product description states, that on either side of each bead, the string has been knotted. Due to this fact, if something happens and it breaks, all the beads will not come off, a common downfall (and hazard) to beaded necklaces. The clasp is another great feature as it would not be easy for a baby to accidently undo. The screw-on clasp is durable and would be too hard for a baby to unscrew.  As a final note, I was pleased to see that the dealer was 100% honest in stating that these were natural Baltic Amber beads. In order to test the validity of this claim, I did a test recommended online to see if the ambers were real. The test was positive proving the necklace is truly made of genuine ambers. Overall, I was very pleased with the quality, and most importantly, the safety of this necklace. I would definitely feel comfortable using it on my child or giving it as a gift to a new mother.
B00KD5O26K|5|Excelente seller
B0028S5KSY|5|This has been the best purchase I've ever made, is so comfortable I will use it after birth.
B0051J0QKY|5|OMG, no more bulky swaddling blankets!  I love, love this swaddle. ignore the bad review, this person has no idea how to use this swaddle.<br />I know how to swaddle in more then one way using a blanket but the baby always ended up too warm so I had to figure out ways to keep the room temperature proper. This swaddle solves this problem. after you watch the video its super easy to use and my large and strong boy cannot get out of it! he can even get out of a woombie. its soft, thin and works well. I will be recommending this to all my friends/family
B001FBFIF0|5|We bought a variety of toys to keep our almost 2-year old entertained on a long road trip, and this was by far his favorite.  He would demand the flashcards and yell out the letters and animals with glee.  It has been 6 months, and he still loves it.  It's indestructible, and liquid proof.  Obviously all kids have different interests, but my son loved this.
B00E24IWZK|1|Poorly made. Much smaller than It seems in the photo. Basket came damaged and seller was very good about giving a refund. Not super sturdy, but I think the price reflects what you get.
B000S8O9ME|5|I have purchased two of these Shower Handles and absolutely love them.  I have a fiberglass tub and surround which is thicker and sturdier than I have had in previous houses.  So when I attach these to my tub surround wall - they stick - tight.  Now I have read the reviews, so I know some people say they loosen up.  I have used these for a while and have not had that experience.  I have one positioned vertically for aid in and out of the tub, and one by the front of the tub near the shower head in a horizontal position.  These are a lifesaver to me because of severe balance issues.  I always give them a test when I'm going to use the shower just to be on the safe side.  I am so happy I found these on AMAZON.
B002NG6TV8|1|I thought I could save a few dollars with this pack and the fact that it was universal (for deco and standard outlets) was a bonus but at the end of the day, the cheap plastic beat out the pros. When screwing it into the outlet, I kid you not, the plastic started to warp. Yeah, you would think it was a matter of not screwing it in as tightly, but I felt it was necessary in order to get the cover flush on the wall. Other than that, the universal feature was nice but not nice enough for me to keep it. These were promptly returned.
B008DWQIJ4|5|The fabric is slightly stiff but it didn't shrink when I washed it and fits the crib mattress that I have.  Honestly I prefer a stiffer sheet for my daughters bed, and since she is a toddler I use fluffier blankets to make up the difference.  The color is true it is a soft blue with stars.
B000XT30G4|5|I needed something to keep my dogs away from the front door when people come or go and this is perfect. I bought this after reading some of the other reviews where it was used for dogs. I do agree that the opening is a bit narrow, but a average size person will easily fit through it.   My dogs are pretty well behaved and they do not jump up on the gate. With all the attachments installed it does wiggle a bit and is not totally sturdy. So if you have a large dog that jumps up on it I don't know if it would hold up if extended to the full width.   I also don't really like the auto close feature, but I just bought an XL door stopper to keep it open when it does not need to be closed. 5 Stars from me cause it does everything I need it to do for my situation and the price was awesome. Also like the color of it. :-)
B008CQUYPK|4|We are primarily breastfeeding but occasionally our son needs formula.  This bottle is a perfect backup especially when we are away from home.  Essentially a bottle can be prepared but still useable for a number of days.  We've been very happy with it. Be aware that the nipple it comes with seems to be a very fast flow, so if you have a newborn I would purchase a slower nipple.  We've even used the included nipple with thicker formula (Enfamil AR) with no problem at all.  The only reason I gave it four stars is the price, because it is impractical to purchase enough to use on a daily basis for regular feeding.  A standard bottle is usually $5-8. I would highly recommend parents of bottle fed infants/children have one for the diaper bag!
B001GQ2SA2|2|Read great reviews which made me but this product. I did like few colorful toys hanging around but when the projector is on it made disturbing noises which almost masked the music . Music is too low . I think the piece it self is defective . Didn't expect this from fisher price . I am unhappy with this purchase.
B004AHKUHM|5|We ordered this for our mother and it works great.  So not just for babies!!!
B000A7V1EM|3|This child seat doesn't fit under my tall table so we had to attach to the kitchen counter - not an ideal second choice but it works so we'll keep it.
B003OUWINA|5|My husband and I purchased this car seat for our son at 1 year once he moved to forward facing.  I wish we would have purchased it earlier.  The fabric is soft and the shoulder covers are softer than other brands.  You can really get this seat tight when securing it into your car and the ease which you can adjust the shoulder straps is worth the extra money.  My only gripe with the design is the protector that goes behind the main buckle (between the legs) is a loose fit.  Ours slipped off quite a few times before we lost it in a parking lot.  But compared to other car seats, this one is really great I would recommend it to anyone.
B000056OWC|1|This was given to us as a shower gift and at first we liked it. Then the front piece that suctions to the tub broke off. The plastic just broke in half. Also our 4 month old son keeps sliding his feet up underneath the plastic bar on the front. Plus it is a saftey hazard without that front piece. Our son has leaned back and almost fliped it over.
B000YZAG7I|5|Hands down one of the best gifts we got. Baby loves it. He looks so focused while in it that we call it \\"the office.\\" I exclusively pump and this is a lifesaver to put baby on while I pump.
B00AH8F5G4|5|Super comfy and pretty too.  Love that it has a harder side and a softer side.  Better than the breast friend.
B00FZGLVAW|5|Great for introducing rice cereal into your baby bottles!
B000JROE6K|4|This is a pretty good pillow.<br />I am 9 weeks pregnant and find that it is pretty comfortable.<br />It's a bit overstuffed which may be difficult once the belly grows but for now it is helps me from rolling on my back and allows for comfort while sleeping or just lying in bed resting.
B00AM5NTIS|5|Love these pouches because my 8-month-old loves them. They work amazingly well - he can hold the pouches all by himself and they are surprisingly non-messy. Great for the car! I fill them up over the weekend and he eats them during the week. They hold up really well too - although our dishwaser doesn't do a great job getting them clean.
B0038W0JI0|5|This seat is worth the money! This was our first Britax purchase. As soon as we opened it up, we wondered why we'd held out so long??? This brand is well worth the cost.
B003C1QPLM|4|muy buen producto
B00EZM7A5C|5|Great product! Baby loves it & I get a lot of compliments on it!
B000ETNU5O|4|This is a fun toy for running around indoors.  It's a bit tricky on our floors, going from wood floor to carpet, it gets stuck a lot.  But if you have some open space it works pretty well.
B009R56U76|5|I cannot compare this product to an OEM but the power given to my pump is just as strong as the wall power cord. Highly recommend and plus so much more affordable than the original.
B005N2O0AG|5|It is so hard to find pillow cases in this size, so I was happy when I finally searched these out. The silky organic cotton fabric and well-finished seams went way beyond my expectations. I'll be ordering more.
B0007CQ6L8|3|I wish I did not have to buy these. It is what I needed but now I have too many. I see how Arm's Reach is profiting...
B004CLBX2M|5|Great look. Easy to install and use.
B005YPOYI0|5|2 out of 3 of my children have needed to be swaddled in order to sleep well.  Both my boys in fact.  I used the True Womb in 2010 for my first son and now I have purchased new ones (both small and medium) for my new little guy.  He just turned 5 mos old and is about 16lbs.  He still fits in the Sz Med just fine.  He is starting to roll over so I am thinking that by the time he outgrows this Sz Med in weight we will probably have transitioned him to a sleep sack.  He definitely needed this though and it has worked very well for us.  Would highly recommend to anyone if your child needs to be swaddled to sleep.  We did have a transition period initially when we started using these TrueWombs from a classic blanket swaddle but it was about a week and then he went back to good solid sleeping.
B002F9MV6K|4|I wish they made these with a slightly wider neck/straps.  Otherwise, it's a nice set of bibs, with some water resistant qualities to it.  Liquids don't seem to soak through due to the plastic backing.  They are pretty easy to clean and do the job of protecting clothes from messes.
B00008YSRN|5|I am a foster mom for newborns and I use the wide neck bottles all the time for my babies. They have helped to eliminate spit up and it helps to control gassiness. The extra parts are a little time consuming to wash but worth it when your baby is happy because he/she is not gassy.  I tried Avent bottles and stopped using them after the first use.  The nipple is so much harder and the formula just leaked down the baby's face. By far, Dr. Brown's bottles are the best!
B000JIDACS|2|This product is huge!! I have an Aprica stroller and this does NOT fit, therefore it was a waste of money for me. I guess it only fits on Joovy products, use caution when buying if you have a different brand
B00JBYNNB4|5|My son loves his potty especially since he picked it out. As soon as he saw it he pulled down his pull-ups and used it. He likes when he tinkles and the Thomas song starts to play.
B0058GE2NM|5|My grand daughter loved her new Hello Kitty nap mat. It is of high quality and a very functional item.
B004HFQON6|5|have come to love this pump so much it's awesome and gets the job done<br />i'm a stay-at-home mom for the moment and being able to pump into the same bottle that will feed my daughter is great.
B005THDZ06|5|Just a tad smaller than what I was expecting, but looks very nice hanging up on her window.  Highly recommend
B00PTL6VLC|5|They are great!
B006PATBI6|1|very bad.. very expensive..
B00RG3TBVS|4|I was so waiting for this product to test. Its spring here and my car so badly needs protection from being soiled by my 5 year old. My kid is very rough on my seats and on the back of my seats. The pack has two sets . and are extremely easy to install and they are adjustable so no need to worry about if they will fit. The mats are extremely durable as well and wash very easily. Even though Black is universal and goes with everything the mats do stick out a bit and can clash slightly against cars with a lighter interior. I found that the mat worked really well for holding all of my kids odds and ends belongings that usually end up on the floor in the backseat. The mat eliminated the dirt and stains that normally end up on the back of the seat. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to keep their car clean and organized!I
B004C053CO|5|Perfect for our 3 month old!  She's much happier with the medium flow bottles and we don't have to squeeze the bottle to help her finish it.  Definitely upgrade your bottle speed if you have a 3 month old and you're still on a the slow flow nipples.
B00ECKPV5S|4|Super soft but doesn't fit the changing pad I have very well. It fits a bit small.
B000W9LX1Y|5|I found this nursing cover today still in the box for $5 at a consignment sale! Don't forget to look at used places for things! Even if you're on a tight budget, you can still find new/lightly new items for good priced, sometimes you just have to be a little more patient when looking for things!
B000YZD0QM|4|I recently purchased the Triumph for my daughter who has two pricier car seats so that she could provide her babysitter with a safe carseat.  We have a total of 5 of these car seats in our family at this point and the quality and safety rating is very good without paying a fortune for the high end seat.  I find two downsides to this carseat--one:  the car seat is not the easiest to attach to your car because it needs to be tight to be safe (I can't put it in myself)--two:  the tightening knob on the harness system is rather difficult to turn -- I wish it worked a little easier as I'm the grandma and don't have the best strength in my hands.  Otherwise, the carseat is fairly well padded, it is safe and reliable.  I would recommend this product.
B0028K2RN8|5|My 7 month old got this for his first Christmas, when he was 3.5 months old.  Never have I seen a baby love a \\"toy\\" more than this one, and I've seen a lot.  I have 5 kids and the recipient of this soother is my youngest.  Initially, he would lie there and just watch Mr. Starfish, as we call him.  Now that he's older, he lights up and coos, sings and smiles the second he sees Mr. Starfish on the ceiling.  The light does have to be fairly low to see the projection, but today, it's merely a rainy day outside and with the lights off, my little guy is playing with the soother in his crib.  Since he is older now we sometimes place the toy in his crib with him and he will spend a good half an hour playing with it.  When the handle falls a certain way, Mr. Starfish will show on his sheets but when the baby pushes it another way, he disappears.  You can just see his little mind working, trying to find Mr. Starfish again.  When he does, it's pure joy.  This is really a great little item and I highly recommend it.  If we were to lose our Starfish friend for some reason tomorrow, I would repurchase immediately.
B00LDWU3AQ|4|Worked as expected. Felt like screws should have been a little longer bc I couldn't get a really tight grip into the wall. Only used one for each window and wrapped cord a bunch of times around. You can use two. Be careful ordering. I believe you get two packs. Read the fine print/  I ended up with a ton of them on accident. No big deal- great price. Kept them for future blind cords.
B009L1VWCO|2|We put the Baby Cuisinart on our registry and were so excited when we received it. I really wanted to make organic food for our daughter and this seemed like it would make things a lot easier. It did - the machine is incredibly easy to use, but unfortunately it makes everything taste of plastic. And while it is a nice BPA-free plastic you're tasting, we all know that BPA's replacement chemicals are just as hazardous as the original.<br /><br />So now this huge disappointment is blocking up my counterspace and the only thing it's good for is pureeing the cooled fruits and vegetables I've cooked on the stove. Do yourself a favor - save some money and your baby's health and buy an all-steel steamer basker and a metal immersion blender.
B0032AMM9C|2|I'm really disappointed with this diaper, it's not at all soft to the touch. It feels like a scratchy cheap quality towel right out of the package and prepping it doesn't really help either... Also, beware that this is NOT an all-natural diaper; the &#34;Organic&#34; title is very misleading. Even just 17% polyester makes for a very synthetic feeling/smelling fabric. I did see this before I bought it but decided to give it a try anyway after enjoying other BabyKicks products (their organic cotton/hemp prefolds and doublers are really thick and nice and soft). This was not at all what I expected in terms of quality. The material is really stretchy, but also VERY thin for a fitted diaper, I was hoping I wouldn't need to use the insert except for nights and naps - I don't think so! No wonder they include a polyester stay-dry liner, this thing will be completely soaked within an hour! I won't be surprised when my LO pees right through it, and I don't imagine I will be enjoying stuffing and unstuffing it with every use and wash - the inserts are bulky and none of my other inserts/doublers fit. Besides that I am so not a fan of having to layer multiple inserts/doublers/liners just to make a diaper work; it's inconvenient and messy and EXPENSIVE when you add it all up. I can't believe the price I paid for these considering the quality - I'm glad I only bought 2! But upset because I paid $40 for diapers I don't even want to put on my baby! What a waste! I don't think I'll be buying diaper products from the PRC anymore.... :/
B00276I462|5|This set is great. We did not use the bumper, but plan to turn each square of the bumper into little pillows later on for our daughters room. We put the quilt on the wall over the changing table and she has spent tons of time staring at the animals and talking to them. It is so cute. We also purchased the decal set and it looks wonderful. I do not use the sheet yet, because our daughter only sleeps well on the carters velour sheets. We plan on using our crib/toddler bed for awhile though, so I am sure it will get used. The dust ruffle looks great and the little raccoon peeks perfectly through the slats in the crib. This is cutest neutral set I have ever seen. I did not wash the quilt, because it is going to be on the wall for a long time. I did wash the bumper by itself on a gentle cycle and it came out fine. I believe i dried it some and then laid it out to air dry. The dust ruffle also came out of the washer fine. I believe it shrunk a little in the dryer, so I would recommend hang drying. It did not mess up how it looks though. Great set. You can't go wrong!!
B009YDCH2S|5|This backpack is good quality and a great size.Doesn't hold too much but it works great.<br />I buy skip hop backpack: owl used together.Skip hop bag very cute.I love skip hop.
B004XCXRK6|5|My son (7.5 months) was constantly grabbing my necklace and trying to put it in his mouth. Also my hair. With these beads, he is distracted and doesn't go for the other stuff. These beads are wonderful!!!
B00KPYK7E0|5|Very good product! Thanks!
B00005V6C8|1|I would give this product negative stars if I could. This was expensive and not worth it. It was very smelly. It is easy to use but that is a negative. My two boys find it very easy to get into. I now use it as an overpriced guest bathroom trash can. I have to be careful and make sure the door is closed to that room or the contents will be emptied by my boys. I have the Neat diaper disposal sysem now and I love it. You have to learn how to properly use it, but once you do, it is easy. My boys can not retrieve anything from it. Anyone who says the Dekor is great must have a new born or not use it fom BM diapers.
B006PATBI6|5|I bought this for my daughter's room before she was born, and 19 months later it's still fantastic. No part of this has worn down unlike my experience with other wipes containers that have the soft plastic you reach through. It keeps the wipes moist with not problems. I have used it with both cloth and disposable wipes and it works equally well for both. It did not work well with the Huggie's Natural wipes which are a bit flimsy like a wet paper towel and they tore. Since I didn't like those wipes anyway it wasn't a problem in the long run.
B004GCJMLG|5|It's hard to figure out how to install the first time, but once you install one you will be able to do them all. I prefer these locks over the latches because my baby likes to bang the doors, which he can still do with the latches. These don't allow that.
B0001CJ9Y0|5|This is the BEST product for keeping your child warm when strolling around in cold weather.  It's like wrapping him/her up in a cozy sleeping bag.  Our son loves it and so do we.<br /><br />It's been wonderful for our little boy (bought at 8mo) however he's a very tall infant (28\\" at the time, 30\\" now at 9.5mo).  I question whether this product will work for him as a toddler since he's already in 18mo-old clothing.  This is why we skipped the infant size.<br /><br />Also, don't purchase this product thinking it will completely cover your child.  It comes up to their upper chest.  The child will still need to wear a coat/hat/mittens.  The flap does come higher, however our son doesn't like to have it pulled up and fights it.<br /><br />All-in-all, this product does what we purchased it for.
B000LSL5ZK|5|I bought these for my first son and have been using them almost every day for the past 3 and a half years. Still in good shape, great for first feedings and so on....
B0031ALSWK|5|Bed is exactly like shown in the picture.  Assembly was pretty straightforward. Instructions for the assembly were actually very good, considering sometimes products like this that are made over seas have instructions that are in Chinese-English, or whatever. These were understandable and with good illustrations.  Took me about 30 minutes to assemble after I inventoried all the parts.  Be sure to check the hardware against the parts list before you start. Some reviewers have complained because they did not have all the hardware. I would speculate that this is because they happened to get a kit that had been returned by someone else, and that person lost some of the hardware before returning it. If some hardware is missing, call the 800 number and they should send you a new bag of hardware. Picture shows a mattress, but it is not included in the kit.But any standard mattress will fit. Some reviewers have complained that it looks &#34;cheap&#34;.  Well, yes, it is inexpensive, but if you want to pay more, go ahead and go to a furniture store and spend $300-$400.  It won't be much better.
B000GEAKNM|5|I had purchased a couple of gates from a big box store for my new home, but it did not register with me that I had a spindle on one side of my stairs where I wanted the gate.  I did some research into what others did about this and bought this product.  My gates are the &#34;Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate&#34;, and this works perfectly.
B002T5Q01C|4|They did exactly what I wanted them to do. Catch poop.
B000RRD8LO|5|Very sturdy swing that works great. My son loves it and I can be confident he's safe while in it.
B002CN5E22|5|This went in our newborn's bassinet at the hospital and ours was the only baby who had a giraffe friend in the nursery with him. Very soothing sounds, even in the hospital setting. When he was in my room, we'd put it on the \\"white noise\\" sound to drown out other sounds. Worked like a charm.  He slept with it for a few months and even now finds it comforting to have on while drifting off to sleep at 9 months.  It turns off automatically in 30 or 45 minutes (there's a setting switch on the back). Still giving it 5 stars with one minor problem.  The velcro loop on the giraffe's neck started to peel apart and got very stiff so we ended up cutting it off. Then I had to sew the back of the giraffe back together. It was not a huge issue and we still love, love, love this giraffe and I recommend it often.
B002HK3TYK|5|This is a very beautiful piece of furniture. It doesn't look cheap, and is perfect for what we intend to use it for. It does take quite a long time to put together. Lots of screws and little pieces, but the finished product is very beautiful and looks like a very expensive piece of furniture. Great investment piece especially if you are on a tight budget. When it was delivered it had its basic wear and tear, but all pieces were in the box and there were no scratches or dents. I would recommend this to anyone who is on a budget and wants a nice piece of furniture.
B000RRD7UG|1|I was excited to use this gate check bag but it only lasted ONE flight, couldn't use it for our return flight home as we noticed both the side seams had come apart when we picked it up at our vacation destination.  Very disappointed in the quality of the construction.
B0097ZBH0Q|5|I love these swaddle blankets. They're so easy to use and my son is nice and snugly and comfortable in them.  They also don't wiggle free as easily as they do in regular blankets. I have used them for all four of my kids.
B000056OUH|5|Don't even think twice about buying this...as Nike says...&quot;Just do it&quot;! The system is easy to use, the bottles are as sterile as a NASA lab (THAT is pretty darn sterile).  It is durable as well, mine has lasted through two children (and is on loan to a friend for their newborn) I cannot imagine any other way to handle the bottles.  BTW, buy the bottles and nipples, truely the best choice out there!
B000KGLQGG|1|This seat is a peice of junk!! Within a week of purchasing this seat for my 6-month old son, the back part that is supposed to fold down broke!  It no longer attaches how it is supposed to attach, and my son cannot use it now. I tried glueing it, but the glue did not hold. In additon, one of the suction cups on the bottom broke off as well. I would not reccomend this seat to anyone.  I also found it difficult to wash my son's bottom in this seat. Now, I just fill the tub up and let him lay on his back or his tummy to bathe him. He loves bath time this way and it's so much easier to clean him!  If you decide to bathe your child this way as well, just make sure the water cannot get in their ears and they will be fine. I called the company who makes the seat and they are sending me my money back. Do not waste your money on this peice of junk seat.
B00009SS6A|5|It is most likely common for families with babies that money can be tight.  I know my growing family would like to dine out more often or indulge in some of the nicer things.  I can't for the life of me think that I would look at a car seat because of price or convience.  I don't want their to be the possability of regret in my family in concern of a car seat.  Now that can make it seem like anyone with an expensive baby saftey product is the best but we all know that it is not always true.  If you read consumer reports and they crash test the seats to see which one holds its integrity the best, that is a more logical step in the process of finding out which seat you should buy.  Do the research yourself, you owe it to your family.
B00IZ3WHB4|5|I have never written a review on baby items but these made me! After five kids, we finally started cloth diapering. At four months, he started wetting through and I was getting frustrated. These are thinner and he NEVER has leaks. Super soft too! I bought directly from their website.
B003ZFPRHS|4|This is a great product, the temperature reading I get seems very much on par for what I test with other thermometers. I only have an infant so I can't say much as to the &#34;fun&#34; factor of the Turtlemeter. We've had no issue with water seeping into the temperature indicator or the battery pack, so the toy is pretty water-tight. There's a bit of work that needs to be done to make sure you're getting the right temperature for a bath:<br /><br />1) Make sure water being tested is uniform temperature. In other words, mix up the water since sometimes the water by the faucet will be hotter/colder than the rest of the tub.<br />2) Submerge the turtle into the water, as the temperature of water is also not uniform from the surface to the bottom.<br />3) Move the turtle around the tub to ensure you get a reading across the board and not just one spot in the tub.<br /><br />Taking a temperature for anything is difficult. As much as we'd like it to be as easy as those laser gun thermometers, it's a much more difficult task than that, especially when dealing with water. That being said, note that no matter what water temperature reader you use, the user end use is the most critical to get the most accurate reading.
B001S9VOZW|4|We have had this stroller for 17 months now and are quite happy with our purchase. I think we paid about $400 for the stroller (didn't buy it from Amazon), making it the most expensive baby item we bought/received for our child. We were worried about spending the money as we are on a very tight budget, but I have to say the stroller is worth the money.  In the time that we have had the stroller we have put thousands of miles on it. I take my daughter (now 16 months) and dog for a three mile walk in the morning and a two or three mile walk in the evening. We started out with the stroller in the U.S. and then because of work moved to Sweden for a year. In the U.S. the stroller went out on a long, gravel road every day with no problems. Now in Sweden we have lived in an urban environment where the stroller stays mostly on sidewalks, though we do take it on wide hiking trails on the weekends. The stroller does fine over tree roots, pine needles and low-lying brush. Last year the stroller made it through the crazy winter snow storms (though it did get jammed up with snow above 12 inches, but hey, what do you expect?). The stroller is also generously sized and adjustable and fits our tall child.  The Queen B is attractive and I've received many compliments (especially in the U.S. where plastic strollers are more plentiful than Sweden). It's easy to assemble and very easy to take the wheels off. We've needed to remove the wheels for travel several times and it's never been a problem. The rain cover works well--we've been caught in many rainstorms and snowstorms over here. The stroller is adjustable (I like being able to make the seat rear or forward facing). The canopy is generous and covers the baby well.  Here are the few problems/issues we've had and why I am rating the stroller 4 stars instead of five.  1. The intertube in one of the tires failed after about five months of solid use. This was not too big of a deal. I went to the local bike shop (nothing special) and the tire was standard size. I think it cost $6 for the replacement tube and I had the option of paying $9 to have the attendant install it (easy to do).  2. The harness is cheesy. The harness is high quality and we have not had a problem with it breaking or falling apart, but even on it's smallest size my toddler can slip her arms under the shoulder straps and push the straps to the side. Also, around 14 months she was able to press the release button on the harness to completely unlock/unfasten the harness. This has not been a major problem because when she was an infant this was not an issue (she was always secure in the stroller and did not fool with the harness) and now she is old enough to know she has to wear the straps and to know not to press the button. I wish, though, that the harness system were better considering the money paid for the stroller.  3. The stroller is NOT small, light or compact. We knew this when purchasing the stroller and decided that since we would not have a car to haul the stroller around it would not be a big deal. The stroller is not too easy for air travel because of its large size, and with the wheels on the stroller will only fit in medium to larger vehicles. We had a Honda Fit in the U.S. and stroller just barely fit in the back compartment.  4. We managed to lose three of the four screws and washers that hold the bottom storage basket onto the stroller. We've since replaced the screws with some standard ones we found at the hardware store, but it seems that the way the screw holes are designed makes it fairly easy for those screws to jiggle loose. The way the storage basket is designed, though, prevents it from falling out even if there is only one screw holding it in place. The basket might slide forward or backward, but it will not fall out of the bottom of the stroller.  5. The most annoying aspect about the stroller is the brake. It's a foot brake and it is strong (holds the stroller in place well). Sometimes, though, if thewheels are not put on in a very specific way (remember we take the wheels off often), the brake sticks in the locked position and I have to bend down to the ground and use a lot of force with my hands to manually unlock the brake. We're in the process of communicating with Bumbleride about this to see if we can have the locking mechanism checked out.  All in all I think these complaints are pretty minor for the amount of time, use and mileage we've gotten out of the stroller. It's made to last and I am sure we'll be using the stroller when the time comes to have more children.
B000HEE73K|5|Very nice looking and comfy for my 3 month old daughter. the package arrived in time. very happy with it.
B003VYIZPY|5|I use these bags all the time and have purchased two more for my husbands bag.  They are great for wet clothes and burp rags. I use the small one for nipples and pacifiers.  I wish there were a size between the two.
B000UEHZG8|5|This bear is my son's favorite stuffed animal and can't go to sleep without it.  He loves to cuddle with it and chew on it.  It has been through the wash several times and has held up nicely!  I will be buying several replacements for when this one gets lost or left behind.  LOVE!!!
B001NJRGIG|4|Contrary to some other reviews, we did not find these hard to install.  Installed them in the drawers of our toddler's bedroom dresser.  It takes a few tries to get used to opening the drawers once installed, but after a little practice I now find it pretty easy.
B00408J6VW|3|Nice and roomy. It's on the heavier side. If you have big babies like I do, then this carseat will be heavy. Kind of a struggle to detach the carseat from the car seat's base sometimes because it seems to stick. I wish I would have picked a different one, but it will do. Pretty large and should fit my little while for a while.
B001KW8DDI|5|This was the answer to our problems for our 2 year old.... he can now turn the lights on, use the restroom, wash his hands and turn the light back off with out help.
B0077DKKT4|5|My wife and I are expecting our first baby boy in February 2013! Just like many other future moms and dads we are very excited and documenting everything along the way. These stickers have been a perfect addition to our pregnancy pictures for our baby book. The stickers are high quality and we have not had any issues adhering them to either clothing or my wife's belly. If you like the design, buy them! You will not be disappointed!
B00EBRAHLU|2|I love the look and versatility of this bag, but the hardware on the top zipper fell off shortly after carrying it, then the zipper broke completely.
B00L8JLUMY|2|Typically I love Mam products. Not a big fan of the starter cup. The spout is hard and it takes a lot of work to get my little one to figure out how to suck the liquid out. If I remove the stopper from the inside the liquid comes out great but not good for a little one learning how to suck out of a cup. It's very cute looking though.
B0087475F4|3|It's really cute. However my son and I can't open it up easily the ears get in the way of the zipper.  I had to cut the ears off :(. So I can only give it 3 stars.
B00I2DJP8K|5|Loved them,
B0007CS4HC|5|I've been through many mirrors over the years with my two kids. This is the only one that stays in place and helps me to truly see my child in the carseat. The beanbag that helps to stablize it is the key. My kids are entertained by the animal as well- we have the bear. Simple design. Easy to setup. Great product.
B00BI37EBQ|5|Great steps. Perfect for my daughters bed.
B004FUPWN6|5|Love this dresser! We got this to match our DaVinci Porter 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, the colors match perfect and so does the shape/style. Great quality and was very easy to assemble, took my husband and a friend about 30-40 minutes.
B000K4YSVI|5|nice for organizing bm in my freezer
B000056OUG|5|I have to say, I love this. Easy to use and most of all,its clean.
B00ECKPV5S|5|This was much thicker, softer and higher quality than I expected. Fit the changing table mattress nicely. Doesn't slip off the corners. Good buy!
B005SPZG5Q|2|I bought this for the twin maclaren triumph.  It doesn't fit on the bar and turns when there is a cup placed in it.
B000ZYL63Q|4|My daughter isn't super thrilled with chewing on these after we chill them but they're a good, durable material. Easy to clean, easy for her to hold.
B00913CZY6|4|good~
B00BIFACT0|5|Hello we bought these because it was the only ones that our little Natalie would use, she has to have this one.
B0010SGZEG|5|I almost did not purchase due to the reviews. I bought these for my 3 year old to use with her octonaut figures. They are bright and do not lose color. It's been a year and they are still very bright and look the same they did the day they arrived. The rubber is thick enough that it's not a choking hazard yet flexible enough to squirt all the water out so it does not mold.
B000OP795A|3|For what you pay for this furniture, you get a decent piece of wood that swings and casters that will roll. Other than that, not much pros about the product. The one support bar across the bottom is flimsy and the mattress is worthless. You are better off paying more money and buying a higer quality product.
B00000J0HU|3|I am less than enthusiastic about this particular rattle.  My main complaints are 1) The toy is too heavy, which makes it difficult for small hands to manipulate 2) This heaviness also makes it comes out of its base too easily 3)he suction cup is useless, so basically you are stuck with just a heavy, bulky rattle. <br />I know that most everyone raves about how innovative and educational Sassy rattles and toys are, and I own several of them.  However, I must confess that I find most of these toys over-rated and find myself using my older second-hand rattles more frequently because they are lighter and easier for babies to handle. <br />Also, if you own a few Sassy toys, then you own them all because they are quite similar in look and feel. Of all my Sassy toys, I'd say our Smiley-face rattle has gotten the most use and this toy has gotten the least.
B00CWN3FWS|2|I received the product in bad shape, it does not work the music and lights are lit butterflies
B001C6Y1QU|4|This is so handy for travel, less bulky  to haul than a baby bed and a really handy changing table when you flip it over. Have not used it as a wading pool yet but I feel it is a very handy safe product.
B00EUTDIC4|5|Lifesaver!
B00DT7TZ7U|5|Great car seat.
B001DVTB8C|5|This was a great price took my husband about an hour to put together had no problems! I noticed the other reviews said it scratched easily I think we may have put a couple in it but it comes with a marker to cover them! Otherwise it's great!
B0028IDXDS|5|My granddaughter loves it - so much better than a regular pacifier.
B00NFY534Q|5|Very cute designs! Love the soft absorbent material, and these fit perfectly.
B003DNS9XG|5|I was looking for something in between the baby bathtub and bathing in the regular tub unassisted.  This was the perfect solution.  It is big enough for my 8 month old to sit on and gives her a little bit of grip since she is still wobbly.  It gives her the opportunity to have a \\"big girl\\" bath and is still manageable for the parent.  It is easily lifted afterwards so it can be dried, but sticks well to the tub during the bath.  It is also easily portable to be taken on vacation and used in hotel baths.  I am so pleased with this product.
B00PF84ATO|4|Holds around 4 scoops of formula. I wish it had a little more room for cereal
B00068O1OC|5|Our baby has been using this toy since she was 2 months old.  You can take off one of the arches for less stimulation and add it later.  She loves the toys, rattles and music although not all at once.  She is learning a lot of new sounds and textures.  We recommend it for any type of baby.
B00C5HT7ZU|5|It is very cute. My daughter and I love it not only because it is so cute but also because it is very soft.
B000G0L2TM|3|This was great the first two months but my daughter outgrew it after that and could get her arms free easily.  It is very handy the first two months, but it is kind of pricey for the short time period.  The material is thin which is nice for summer, but the thin material easily rips and mine is 3 months old and already has a hole.  I would recommend just purchasing a large thin blanket to swaddle.  If you really have a hard time making a swaddle, this is handy.
B007AKGBU6|4|Daughter never took to the walker itself but the musical insert has been a toy to come back to daily or weekly for nearly 8 months.
B00C0XNITU|5|This thing is a life saver!  Have a willful 3½ year old who was waking up earlier & earlier (before 5am).  Would not stay in bed in the am.  Bought this a week ago, and it worked like a charm since day 1.  It even made bedtime easy.  I don't believe it's confusing, but have to read the directions once to get the features down.
B0052QYLUM|5|I decided on this because it was the cheapest video monitor at the time I wanted to purchase one.  It does a great job.  Sometimes you can accidentally turn it on the mute setting which is frustrating.  Basically it is silent until your child makes a noise and then it clicks on.  I personally like to hear the hum of the monitor.  I am very pleased with the quality of this product for the price.
B001AXAD3K|5|My girls insist on wearing them at home too :)<br />It's the right size, looks great, useful.... A great buy!
B007IV17PQ|5|A must have.  This product will keep your baby entertained for hours.  Very cute and well made.  It is worth the money.
B002RL7UWQ|2|I was a little suspicious of this seemingly miraculous one-second thermometer. But after being up several nights in a row with a sick, hot child, and not being able to get him to lift his (hot) arm OR keep his (hot) little lips closed, I resolved to find a better way to take his temp. I wasn't freaking out or anything, kids get sick and then they get hot, but this kid doesn't get sick very often, so I'm not yet terribly adept at distinguishing between 99 degree temp and a 106 temp. A one-second thermometer seemed to be the solution to all of my problems.<br /><br />Received it in the mail yesterday and here are my observations:<br /><br />1.) OH MY GOD. it was encased in one of the most bullet-proof, tamper-proof clam shell packages I have ever encountered. Almost had to resort to a blow torch to open the thing. Luckily a hedge-trimmer did the trick before things went too far.<br /><br />2.) I have never seen so many safety warnings in a user-manual. Safety warnings. For a 4-inch plastic thermometer. Safety, dear reader, is paramount to the use of this item. \\"Injury, fire or DEATH.\\" These are the potential tragic consequences that I, the naive ear thermometer-user faced, and was warned about AD NAUSEUM in red, bold lettering, AND in seven additional languages, were I to use this item incorrectly. It's as if I bought a blow torch or something, which i almost purchased, to open this dangerous item.<br /><br />3.)  Let's take a moment to review the reviews on this product - all of the good reviews = 1 -3 sentences, similar syntax, similar spelling mistakes. Let's just accept that all of the good reviews were written by people who were paid to do so. All of the bad reviews were clearly written by real people who had real (unsatisfactory) experiences.<br /><br />Happy temperature taking!
B0001NE5HU|5|My husband and I just put this crib together and it looks wonderful!  I had been debating between a few different styles that I saw online, but then I saw this one assembled in a Toys R Us store and really liked it.  The bonus also was that they have this crib in stock (at least they do in the MN stores) which avoided any shipping costs.    <br /> <br />The crib was very easy to put together--we were able to do it in about 45 minutes.  It was very well packaged and none of the pieces were damaged.  The wood is a very nice quality and seems to be quite sturdy. <br /> <br />I hadn't planned on buying a convertible crib, but it's nice to have the option if I decide I want to use it later.  You can't go wrong for this price! <br /> <br />
B0058W7ABM|5|Alittle missleading the picture shows 5 charms but you only get one. Also the clip for the necklace needs to be stronger my son broke it already and hes only 5.
B0000936LR|4|The activity gym is nice and bright and happy.  Its only shortcoming is that the mat is a bit thin, making it necessary to use a heavy blanket underneath if you're using it on hard floors/surfaces.
B004KSOGW6|5|My baby daughter (2y4mo) just love it. She is carrying it everywhere we go.  totally recommend it to anyone. IS odor free, no leaking, VERY easy to clean. And most important babies like it, as it well shapped for their delicate bodies.
B00XIH0YG2|2|My 11 month old was able to remove one of these from the corner of a table and shove the entire thing into his mouth. It took just seconds and gave us a bit of a scare.<br /><br />I'd have no problem using these as corner protectors in a non-childproofing situation but for infant/toddler use this product does not seem safe. We switched to the Roving Cove corners and feel more comfortable as they are larger and the adhesive is more sturdy.
B000058CC4|5|My baby has palagiocephaly (flat head) and this works wonderfully for keeping her positioned on her side for 12 hour nights.  I highly recommend it.  At first she wasn't keen but after a couple of times using it she was most happy.
B000TFMIMY|5|My 6 month old son LOVES his Angel Dear Frog Blankie.  We received one as a gift, and I wound up buying 3 more since he loves it so much that I need to have extras on hand in case one is in the wash or if any get lost.  They are so soft to the touch and he uses these to soothe himself to sleep in the car seat or in his crib at night.  He never really took to a pacifier so having something else to use as a source of comfort has been great!!  My sister in law has other Angel Dear Blankies for her children, and they love theirs as well.  I recommend these to all of my friends having babies and typically buy them as shower gifts.  We received several variations on the &#34;lovey&#34; blanket as gifts, and my son liked the Angel Dear brand the most!
B000PRUAFI|5|We got this gate to keep our one year old away from the dogs' dishes and the stairs.  It works perfectly for what we need!  It was a quick and easy installation.  Love how the gate can swing either way and remains open if needed.  When it's closed, it remains latched, even without locking, when our little one decides to shake the gate.  Definite recommend!
B0038JDV0Q|4|This spoon is great for feeding our baby. It's not too hard and the shape is good for his little mouth. The only complaint I have is about the color. From the pictures and color name, aqua, I thought it would be a bright blue. It is more of a darker gray color with a blue tint.
B00003TL7P|5|I have two Diaper Champs and I love them! First of all, with three babies, the last thing I need is to worry about special bags. Secondly, this thing is so easy to use! I am usually in a hurry and the flip handle is very easy to use. You get a sense for when it's getting full if the plunger doesn't go down easily - though diapers still go in if that's not a convenient time to change the bag. I change the bag about every day or two (as I said, I have two, so the diapers are split between the two) and rarely have any odor at all. If I do, it's minor, and it's because the lesser-used one hasn't been changed in a while. It's easy to change the bag, and if there did get a small smell, I wipe it down with one of those Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and presto, all better! There are very few surfaces that come in contact with a diaper and it's very easy to clean. Believe me, any product that is not easy to use gets chucked quickly in my house! And I would buy the Diaper Champ again in a second. LOVE IT!
B001OMGKUW|3|The Cusion Material not so great and it doesn't swing freely. I found better ones for same price at walmart.
B0091537TG|3|Good crib sheet.. fit mattress perfectly..color faded a little after first wash. Will probaby purchase again if needed in future.
B00BEVF1XU|5|LOVE this car seat!  Super easy to move from car to car!  Britax makes car seats that give me a measure of comfort knowing my children are safer.  We have not had any of the problems I've read others have had.  I will say this, if you snug up the seat belt tight before closing down the door to secure it, it can be a bit of a tight click and the squeeze release can be tight as a result, but it isn't really a problem for us so far.  I love how easy this is to move between cars.
B00CE8C65I|2|Works well. I ordered black and got a pewter color. Installed it rather than dealing with the hassle. Worked nicely tho. Just wish it were black.
B00M42Y0CG|3|Center divider leg had pre drilled hole off 1/4&#34; and didn't realize until drawer would pinch locked... Fixed myself and reassembled. 3 hours later it does appear to be a very nice piece of furniture
B0042D69XS|5|I bought this as a baby shower for my cousin. It's adorable & soft..and very soothing to the baby! Success!
B00IRGA6GC|1|This baby crib sheet is slick and feels cheap.  It's not soft like cotton.  Very thin.  I should have paid more attention to the description.
B0041Q2V5Q|1|This is the fifth monitor we have tried and it is by far the worst.  With a name like Motorala you would expect something far better than what you get.  Please do not be fooled.  The monitor will drop the signal continuously and nothing we would do would make it work.  The signal will drop for a few seconds to five minutes.  I have tried to relink then and even turn the monitor off and wait thirty seconds to a minute and then turn it back on in hopes that it would pick up the signal but nothing works for long.  I would encourage no one to buy this product it is unreliable and a complete waste of money.  I am in the process of returning it now.
B00W9XT5PC|5|great product and very sturdy, I received a discount for this<br /><br />so far so good great product came very quick and packaged very well.<br /><br />thank you
B00006966I|1|I bought these bottles to use to supplement my baby's breastfeeding.  I thought that the special design would be a help to gas problems associated with bottle-feeding.  My child cried for hours when I tried to give her these bottles.  At first I thought she was having difficulty transistioning over to bottle-feeding, but I discovered that the nipples would not release any milk to my baby.  I tried to fix the nipple, but it still took her 2 hours to take one ounce of milk!  Don't do this to your child...it is horrible to hear them scream for hours.  I went back and purchased Avent bottles...she took them from the first moment.
B005LZVS28|5|love it!  granddaughter can have her sippy cup and a snack without worry of messes!
B0088UXLSW|5|good
B0000E262S|5|I have boy/girl twins that are now almost 10 months old.  I have been very scared of SIDS and that is why I bought two Angelcare motion monitors for my babies.  It was expensive with 2 but well worth the money.  I slept (when allowed to) so much better, knowing that if one of them stopped breathing, that an alarm would sound.  And for the first 8 months of their life, no alarm ever sounded (unless we forgot to turn the monitor off after we had removed one of the babies, which happens a lot in the beginning, but will get better with time) until... of all days, my very first mothers day.  That night around 11:45 PM, I heard that horrid beeping sound coming from their room.  I ran in there and realized it was my sons monitor.  I picked him up and began shaking him and rocking him and he felt cold and looked blue.  I thought the worst had happened.  But then, he took a deep breath and opened his eyes and has been fine ever since.  I think, if we would not have had the monitor, he would have died that night.  I cant say enough about these monitors.  Just for the peace of mind they give you.  Teffeni Brodie, CA.
B00F08ITAK|5|Cute bag, and especially for the price. I might buy another in a different color. I've had several compliments on it.
B000A1AF8G|5|The Britax Regent, is certainly a wonderful, expensive, large car seat. Having said that, it is the safest car seat out in the market aside from the Sunshine Kids car seat for children over 40 plus pounds. When searching for car seats, I was not aware of the importance of having a child in a 5 point harness for as long as possible until I read a story of a four yearl old boy who lost his life while seated in a booster seat. Studies show, that it is beneficial to have your children in a five point harness for as long as possible.     The price of this seat is hefty but nothing compares to having the peace of mind and security that your child is in the best seat available.  The seat itself is large, too large for that matter- but it sure does look and feel cozy and safe.   We bought a 2008 highlander and could barely stretch out the seatbelt to accommodate this car seat. So be warned!       I personally would buy another one for our Echo- if the car was a little larger- for now, our only choice is the Sunshine Kids and Britax for our SUV.
B00D992KDE|5|After the money I spent on my new iphone, I would never let the kids hold it to listen to music, etc.  BUT NOW that I have this case, I don't worry about them scratching it or spilling on it.  I can let them hold it to watch a short video or listen to music and I am not stressed that it will get ruined.  It is great to use in the grocery store when your kids need a quick/easy distraction while you are shopping.  Great item and LOVE all the styles... especially this fun green!
B00T5GX8K4|5|My son really likes it
B00925WLEM|5|look pretty and work like they should.
B00LLWMIVU|5|This is our first time using a teething necklace, but after our third child had such a horrible teething experience, I didn't want to risk with our fourth child so I bought this necklace. He's 4mo old now and doesn't seems to have started teething yet, so I'm only rating on the quality of the product. The necklace is well made. It has knots between the beads, so that if it breaks the baby couldn't choke on the beads. The screw closure stays together very well (have only had to tighten it once while on). The screw closure looks just like the beads so it's not noticeable. There's a lot of skepticism about amber teething necklace, so I'm hoping it proves to work!
B000WH2GTE|5|I just recieved the pink lamb lovey for my one year old daughter in the mail today- We will be purchasing another one right away! It is absolutely beautiful. SO soft and cuddly! I can't wait for her to snuggle with it tonight. :) I am currently 8 months pregnant with our second daughter- and she will definitely have a couple Angel Dear Blankies of her own! I would highly recommend them to anyone, and will be buying a couple as shower gifts for friends as well.
B006T89X9Q|1|I was disappointed with this nipple.  My son gulped causing him to get choked on the milk coming through.  He ended up being fussy and gassy.  The way he drinks using this nipple is certainly not the same as him nursing.  I was disappointed in this product.  It did not measure up to the hype from the manufacturer.
B00FRQEWAQ|4|I like the cover so far, it is very soft. The only drawback I have seen so far is that the hook part tends to grab everything, and is somewhat hard to pull off, which is good for when it is in place, but a pain if a wiggly baby causes it to hook back on itself, and it takes two hands to separate. But it has cleaned up beautifully when there was a diaper blowout - and kept all the mess inside the cover.
B000V8LCA8|5|I love this product! They are easy to clean, can be steam serilized in the microwave (not all baby bowls/dishes can go into the microwave), and the food can be thawed/reheated in the microwave.     As another reviewer mentioned, I did have one that popped open when I put it in the freezer, but that was because I filled it too full. Just fill it to the max line and you will be fine. I also like that these cubes (when filled properly) don't leave the food freezer burned. I'm not sure if that's a problem with the ice cube trays, but that was one of the reasons why I wanted to try these. And I haven't been disappointed!    This two ounce size is great for my twins. I also love that there is a measuring line on them so I can divide the food evenly between the twins to make sure both are getting their fair share! I believe there are also smaller 1oz cubes you can buy, but the 2oz size seems to be the perfect amount after your baby has been introduced to solids and starts wanting more than just a taste of food. For me, I pull out 2 or 3 of the 2oz cubes and can easily get the twins meals ready in just a few minutes.    Instead of writing on these with a dry erase marker, I just put a small round sticker on the front of the tray with the food and date, and it works great for me. The trays allow me to stay organized so it's easy to know how much of a particular kind of food is left... so I know when to make more!    I originally only bought 2 trays to test them out and see how they worked. I loved them so much that I've ordered another 2 trays and may be back for more!
B00G3H0G2G|4|Used with a rear facing carseat and at a point it just couldn't fit. It does droop down a little, but I'm hoping use with forward facing carseat is better.
B0054H97KI|4|The nipples are larger than the Medela ones I started out with. This turned out to be a positive, because now baby sucks so hard the Medela ones collapse. The Avents hold up nicely, and are durable enough to withstand the daily abuse at daycare. Its a bit of a pain to clean the extra little piece that fits around the top, but I got used to it.
B00IBO5O6W|5|Best bath tub mat we have owned (and there have been many!)!
B003IT4YAM|5|We tried a few of the name brand car seats before we tried this one.  I love it and so does our little one.  The materials are very good, it feels very sturdy and very safe.  The complaints people have about a tight fit rear facing are fair and mostly valid.  Our little guy is still facing backwards at 15 month and he's in the 97% percentile for height at 33&#34;.  We have in a Scion XA.  He's has to cross his legs, but he's not complaining yet.  We turned it around once to see how it would work and it really does fit a lot better.  What's important is that we know he's safe and he will dose off in the seat on longer trips.  He was fighting the sleep in other seats.  We also get a lot of complements about the styling....it's looks like a race car seat, after all, that is what Recaro makes!<br /><br />He threw up in the seat one time and it was really easy to pull apart.  We washed the cloth in the laundry on super delicate (front load machine) and let air dry.  No problems what so ever.  The instruction tell you how to take it apart but warn you not to machine wash.  I'm not recommending you try it, but it worked out OK for us.<br /><br />Bottom line, this seat was about $50 less than the name brands like Britax and Graco.  It's incredibly well built and we know that with all of the adjustments to the height that it offers, we'll have it for a long time.  Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
B001F6YMXE|5|reall a very nice and versitle play pen.  Well constructed.  Fast shippuing and was even better than we expected.  Would recommend.
B00G5DVCKS|5|Purchased a refurbished WiFi Baby 3 monitor a couple of months ago.  Setting up was pretty simple, however I began to have issues with the app losing the connection.  I went to their website and followed the instructions for setting up a static IP address and it has been working smoothly ever since.  Recently my wife wanted to have remote viewing setup so she could use the monitor while doing yard work, etc.  I spent a couple hours following the guide on their website and was totally stumped, so I set up a support ticket with the manufacturer and within a few hours a support technician emailed me and we set up an appointment at my convenience.  At the appointed time the technician, Gary, called me and we set up a screen sharing session so he could basically take control.  He was very knowledgable and within 10 minutes had everything up and running so we could use the monitor both on our home wifi network or stream over the internet with remote viewing.  I am very impressed with the product, but I'm even more impressed with the customer service.  A+ product and A+ company...
B00BZSUD9O|5|It's beautiful and my daughter loves it. I like the fact that it came with a small enough pillow for her bed and her. The detail is phenomenal.
B006ZW2TLU|5|I will be the first to admit that while I do keep teaching healthy eating habits to Ladybug in the back of my mind, I don’t always DO just that. I’m also nowhere close to being able to say that I meet the each and every one of her nutritional needs every day. And, while I’m not afraid that Ladybug will become “obese” because lets face it, I can hardly get her to finish a meal, but I do want to make sure that WHAT she’s eating and drinking is healthy for her and provides nutritional value.<br /><br />That’s where the Fresh Baby MyPlate Set comes in. The 6-piece set includes (1) 4-Section MyPlate, (1) 4- to 6-ounce Dairy Cup, (1) MyPlate & Activity Placemat, and (1) 3-piece Cutlery Set with case.<br /><br />This set is designed for children aged 3-5 years and is FDA food safe; BP-A, Phthalate, Cadmium and Lead-free! The MyPlate is separated into four sections designed for correct serving size: Fruit, Grain, Vegetables, and Protein (meat, eggs, or beans).<br /><br />The dairy cup is sized perfectly for little hands and is still large enough to fit in a good amount of milk, which is great because Ladybug LOVES milk! It’s extremely sturdy and has thick siding so that you can be confident that you can use this cup for years. But, one of my favorite aspects of this set is the silverware set.<br /><br />These babies are amazing! I’m so over the flimsy plastic eating utensils that children are “supposed” to eat with. I love that these are made with actual metal and hard plastic so that they are extremely sturdy. I’m confident that these will last us through multiple children and maybe even grandchildren if cared for correctly.<br /><br />Speaking of caring for these items, they are all dishwasher safe but should never be used in the microwave.<br /><br />*I was sent these complimentary products by Fresh Baby in exchange for my honest review. I was not compensated monetarily for this post.
B004A5TTLW|4|This diaper liner works well, variety of colors/designs, keeps all cloth diapers in a stable bag, both soiled and stained diapers. In addition it is beneficial to all other soiled baby clothing as well. I would recommended this product to friends!
B000067EH7|5|We absolutely love this bathtub! It is easy to give our newborn a bath in this tub and it is something he will be able to grow into. We definitely recommend this tub!
B0009V0TBU|4|It is very useful but it is a little difficult to get the actual seatbelt where it is supposed to be ... but this could be because we are first time parents ... a little clueless to what the heck we are supposed to do about anything ... lol.
B0038JDD36|1|Please, Please, PLEASE do research before buying these deadly strap covers! All car seat manuals strictly state that ANY after market product (something that didn't come with the seat) should NOT be used. Read your manual for verification if you don't believe me. These straps cause lose fitting straps, and the chest clip to be too low on baby's body. The Car Seat Lady explains it simply and effectively.    Keep your babies safe, do NOT buy these!    [...]
B00IOIAPLY|5|She loved this. Fit my 7 yr old granddaughter perfectly and stays in my  vehicle glove compartment
B007A2ZSZ8|5|WE originally bought these to keep our curious toddler out of the fridge. I bought a few other fridge locks first and the glue never held and my daughter was always able to break the locks. These however are strong! She has tried countless hours to break them and it does not work. In fact when she figured out how to unlock the standard cupboard locks I purchased these to replace them and I also installed on on my front screen door to keep her in.  I sometimes wonder if they'll be difficult to remove considering how well the glue holds but I suppose I'll have to cross that bridge when we come to it.
B002VDY352|5|I have two strollers, and two toddler boards. This one is definitely superior to the other one (Uppababy Vista Piggy back board). The angled design in the back hardly interferes with one's stride, the stroller steers wonderully with the board on, unlike other strollers with a board. My son is almost 5 yo and 40 lb and it still pushes like a dream when he rides on the board, I can't really feel the extra weight when pushing the stroller. It's also extremely easy to pop on and off of the stroller.<br /><br />The only cons I can think of is that when using on the Bugaboo Bee if my son leans to one side too much the stroller is unbalanced and once when he was fooling around, wobbling from side to side he almost turned the stroller over. But that's more of a behavior problem. Also the bungee cord for holding it up is not that easy to use and it can slide open if not ptoperñy tightened.<br /><br />We love this board and would recommend it o anyone with an older toddler pr preschooler.
B007OXM0HW|5|This little piggy back is perfect for the little one who is a train lover. The quality is excellent. The size is small but perfect.
B008UDM21E|1|We returned this product.  It couldn't reach from the boys room to ours, and we're o lily 3 doors apart in a one story.
B002UXQRNE|5|I bought some of these in the sets with 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife a few months ago.  My 2-year-old daughter likes them.  They seem easy to hold, easy to pick food up with, and look just as good as new after going through the dishwasher many many times.  I was happy to find the forks in a 3-pack, but I don't want to end up with a bunch of pink forks that my son won't want to use when he is old enough.  But I definitely would recommend these to anyone who doesn't care what color they get.
B000I2ZFR8|5|Perfect item!
B00AAJNHA6|4|I did a lot of extensive research with baby video monitors before I purchased this and I am extremely happy with this product. I hate long reviews so I'll keep it short. For the price and quality of it, this monitor is perfect.<br /><br />Even when it's in night vision mode, I can still see my daughter breathing which is a huge plus as a first time mom. The picture quality is good, not great because it doesn't give you the crystal clear HD vision but it does the job.<br /><br />The two things I hate the most which is why I knocked a star off are...<br /><br />1. The battery sucks. Even when I charge it and carry it around, it will probably last 2 hours max if I'm lucky. I have to keep it plugged in at night to make sure it doesn't die on me.<br /><br />2. The microphone ability is awesome! But when we speak into it- it totally sounds muffled and like you're underwater. My daughter is a year and a half and every time we talk to her through it, she gets terrified. I know she'll slowly ease away from the terror of the sound as she gets older but the microphone sucks.<br /><br />All in all- it's truly great for the price and does the job. I primarily needed this so I can watch my daughter breathe while she sleeps :)
B002QYW8LW|5|This is easy for baby to hold, plus gets them used to the sensation of a toothbrush<br />before they actually need one.  A great design and made to last a long time.
B008KW8JTE|5|Works great
B0049NYYJ2|5|This is simply THE BEST THING known to a parent. You can use it for so many things, most of all when handling your baby. I cannot fathom not having this around when feeding or just holding my baby. Oh and most of all: buy it before you give birth and take it with you to the hospital. Trust me on this one, you will need it from the first day. I ordered the Monkey design and it's so soft and cuddly! It's big enough that I've even used it for when my back hurts. I love the design as well, you don't have to mess with belts or super wide pillows like the Brest Friend. This goes in front of you, or you can turn it to the side a bit and bingo, your baby will be comfy from any angle.
B002LTQW8M|4|It's cute, but does not bounce for nearly as long as some other bouncy \\"mobiles\\" I've seen.
B000I2MRLK|5|Baby Girl loves the Lamaze Peacock. I can hang it on her carseat or her playmat and she'll be entertained by it for several minutes. She loves, loves, loves the crinkling sound that the peacocks wings makes.
B00112AUVK|1|I was very excited to get this cradle in the mail after I ordered it.  Most of the reviews that I read about this product were very positive.  Usually good reviews point to a good product.  Unfortunately, this is not the case this time for me.  Apparently the other people who reviewed this cradle do not know that good quality furniture is made from solid wood and not pressed board.  Or, perhaps they can't recognize pressed wood because there is so much cheap furniture that Americans buy these days at places like Walmart. I am very surprised and dismayed that so many people reviewed this cradle positively when it is clearly a cheap item.        Also, I am very disappointed with the description of the product by the manufacturer.  It is very misleading.  They claim online that it is \\"Made of Pine\\" and that it is \\"Formaldehyde-free\\" and \\"Made with wood from sustainable forests.\\"  There is no mention of pressed wood.  I did read in one of the reviews that the piece of wood that goes under the mattress was made of pressed wood.  However, that is easily replaceable, along with the cheap mattress.  I bought the cradle thinking that I would need to replace those two things, but I didn't worry about the rest of the cradle because it was supposed to be made of pine according to the manufacturer's description.  However, it is not solid pine!  The headboard and the footboard are made of pressed wood, and they cannot be easily replaced!  The rocker portion, the crib slats, and the overall frame appear to be made of solid wood, but there is enough pressed wood in this cradle to make it smell strongly of chemicals, and it looks cheap.  I could tell right away when looking at the headboard and the footboard that it was not real, solid wood based on the slight variation in color and the fake grain pattern.    As a new mother I am very concerned about purchasing items that are made from pressed wood because they contain a number of components that are very harmful to babies and smallchildren - not to mention the adults who share the room with the furniture.  Is it so difficult to make a little cradle out of solid pine?  I am angry that this was advertised without disclosing the entire truth about the product.  If you care about whether or not you are subjecting your child to harmful toxins/vapors coming from products that contain pressed wood, then you should definitely pass up this item and pay more money to get a quality, solid wood item from another manufacturer.      It is not stated online where this cradle is made.  Can you guess where?  China.  You don't find that out until you see it stamped on the box.   I'd like to suggest to Da Vinci that they start making their cradles of solid wood by people who will make a quality product - namely by craftsmen in the U.S.A.!  As for me, I'm sending this piece of junk back and I'm going to purchase a solid wood cradle from another company.  I will make sure that my new cradle is pressed board free (and therefore toxin free) for my child to sleep in.
B00838FJN4|1|I bought this car seat about a year ago and ever since i have had problems with it. The yellow latch bars get stuck and will not hook in my car properly. Also the other day I went to move it from one car to a different and I picked it up and the side broke completely off! The damn thing was made of styrofoam and this is supposed to keep my child safe??!! I do not recommend this seat to any one ever. Or any baby trendz brand anything. Their manufacturers are not friendly at all and this product is crap!
B001F8TLLU|5|I got this for a baby shower present 3 yrs ago and have given it as a gift at all of the baby showers i go too! It is perfect! It allows one simple place to put important documents and slips from the doctor that you want to hang on to! Totally recommend it!
B00FCSCJB8|5|This is exactly what I was looking for, sturdy material and construction holds large water bottles and it had a magnetic closing pocket in between the cup holders.  I used it in the rain and my cell phone stayed dry.  I gave this five stars because I love everything about it and it shipped so quickly!
B00D2JN87I|4|Well. In a moment of desperation I ordered this miracle device and even paid the next day expedite for Prime Members.  I have been let down. I equate this device to my reaction of #PrimeDay and overall just a big let down. The sushing only made my daughter more angry. However, after three days of constipation she did finally poop. I will give credit to the susher as it likely annoyed her enough to poop.  So. The lesson learned here fellas is to just listen to your wives as if I did listen to my wife I would not have wasted my money on this.  ****Update 8/22/15****  Well. After a few weeks of testing and playing with the susher we have found that under the right circumstances (for our baby she had to already be calm) the susher is great at keeping our baby calm. For us, it doesn't help when she is already agitated and it actually makes her more angry.   My big frustration is that it times out after 30 minutes. I would be happy if it had a constant setting.
B001IYQ7QS|5|Love this for over laminate floor under highchair.  Durable!
B000KJZOWU|5|Very comfy, helped my girlfriend sleep during her pregnancy.
B00DGWPBVM|5|Great product would recommend to all young girls.  Keeps food cold and hot when it has to. Hope it last for a long time.
B000067K0L|4|Love this play mat.  Would have given 5 stars, but the material is a bit slippery, so my little one has a tendency to slip a bit.  However, he still manages to scoot around at only 7 weeks.  Love the hanging items to play with... the giraffe has made its way onto his infant seat and he just stares in love.  I really like the snap at the top that you can just undo and then make a quick diaper change.  Also, I have had to work with him on some head/neck exercises and the snap has allowed me to quickly pull the hanging parts down when I can catch him in just the right mood to allow me to work with him for a few minutes.  Also have thrown in the back of the SUV to take on trips to other houses.  Light and easy.  We had another brand of play mat, which was great for my daughter, but I'm very happy with the musical/light part of this item and would have liked something like this for her.  Would recommend to a friend/give as a gift.
B007HS6W6Y|4|I like the light on this, I can see baby at night. The music is nice but could be louder. He can't hear it while he's crying.
B009AFXZLC|5|I immediately sensed I would be getting my money's worth when I opened the box. This product came in its own dust bag. Once I took that off, I could feel the weight of the bag itself, signaling a very well-made product. It feels as if the entire bag is insulated (I don't believe it is but It has the feel of a nice insulated lunch bag). Inside and out, it has a wirable surface should any liquids spill.<br /><br />Cons: It is heavy, but despite this, I will still give it 5 stars since it is a beautifully made product. (This is also an incentive for me to really rethink what I might actually need during a flight or while out and not overpack.<br /><br />Pros: Unquestionable quality, a good mix of zippered and slip pockets all over/inside the bag (zippers are thick and seem to be well-made, deep zippered pocket inside,  with 2 cell-phone-sized slip pockets outside of it, 3 slip pockets on the opposite side, neutral water resistant lining, no velcro, a very large pocket with a flap and magnetic closures on from and extremely large zippered pocket on the back with water resistant lining in the same print as the inside, comes with a cross body strap that is detachable and adjustable, has 5 metal &#34;feet&#34; on the bottom<br /><br />Overall I am VERY satisfied with this bag and would purchase it again. I had actually purchased a matching duffel and carryon bag from a different designer prior to this, but they were too flimsy and thin. These (I also purchased the small duffel) will replace them as both my carry-ons while traveling with a toddler and newborn, but also will be used as my hospital bags.
B000BNQC58|5|My toddler loves this nightlight, as do I. We use it every night. It is basic compared to the other models since it doesn't have any sounds, but I like that. You can have it set to one color or have it alternate all 3. Shuts off automatically after 45 minutes. Comes with batteries ready to go. I definitely want to buy this for all of my nieces and nephews for each of their upcoming birthdays! Everyone would love this nightlight! Worth the price.
B000FL5090|5|Great for traveling and keeping bottles cold
B004M0RX3Q|5|If you want quality plush, Mary Meyer is the way to go. Their corporate offices are so helpful and the animals are top quality. I was thrilled to find this dog for my son.
B000E89BNU|5|Great product for cleaning teflon skillets as it cleans and dislodges food yet it doesn't scratch pan. Highly recommend it.
B006VIQUYA|5|excelente.
B00315HEF0|4|I purchased this as a Christmas present for my 14 month old son and he loves it. We take it everywhere with us. I do wish the steering wheel had more freedom to turn but other than that is is durable for my toddler. I'd recommend this for sure!
B007NG5UF4|4|I got this because my Mamaw is 93 and she can't get around as well these days & my Mom is constantly on the go around the house & property. She could not go off the porch with the old monitor so I got her this one. It has pretty good range but isn't as sound sensitive (can't hear bed covers rustle) as we'd have liked. Also the volume only goes up to 5 which is fine if there isn't any other noise but difficult to hear if other noise is present, ie: in the laundry room. I paid $25 bucks for it so I think it was worth it for the range but Mom has to be more focused on listening to it.
B00AHVR7YO|5|My daughtewr loves this chair.  I bought it for my grandson and shipped it to her.  He is 4 months old and it is perfect for him.
