B00027H1DU|5|Just right.
B00YMMTMHE|1|Did not have any problem installing the break and gas pedals, but the foot break (the smallest one in the set) did not come close to fitting. They really should sell the set without the foot break pedal, or make it to fit. For that reason, I am only awarding a single star. When you purchase items in a set, it's intended to be used as a set, not as parts of one!
B00T0TPCMI|5|Looks awesome on tinted windows!
B00JFZ9V8I|5|good
B00CFNMBDY|5|Little small for my gear coz its an older car, but love the grip. It doesnt slip n it doesnt bother me at all.

B000BZ93HK|5|Good quality and fit.
B00CCYWJQK|5|The trailer waste water drain is located about 75 feet from the sewer access pipe at our house.  We buried a 1-inch hose, attached it to the T-Junction at the house sewer stand pipe, and ran it to a post near the trailer drain pipe.  Had to buy an adapter to connect the SewerSolution hose to the 1-inch hose, but only $1.50.<br /><br />We also buried the fresh water feed hose, which began about 20 feet beyond the sewer stand pipe, and ran it to the same post, which was right beside the trailer city water connection.  We attached a quick-disconnect fitting to the fresh water hoses and the SewerSolution feed-water hose.  That makes changing hoses easy.  I make sure to flush the fresh water line before re-attaching the trailer feed line after each use of the SS system, because possible contaminated water makes me panic.<br /><br />The SewerSolution system does the job.  The clear cap lets me see the high-velocity jet pulverizing solid waste as it is forced into the outlet and down the hose.  The clear cap also lets me see when the waste water tanks are empty.  The configuration of the three tanks on my trailer do not allow the SS system to flush out the black water tank.<br /><br />The 3 waste water tanks are 35, 40 and 45 gallons.  They do take a while to empty, but that's what happens when a 5/8-inch hose is used as a drain.
B004FZ7TQ4|5|perfect for the Liverpool fan
B001W9OP86|5|Is what I expected
B00GSAUHB8|2|This item is well made and easy to fold up or unfold, but it does not stay up in my 2012 Dodge Charger. I measured my windows ahead of time and technically it should fit. The material would cover the windows, but the material flaps around on the edges so the top corners hand down and let all of the sun in. The circles in the middle do stay rigid, but what it doesn't show you in the picture is the rear view mirror. I thought the mirror would help hold the shade in place but the material between the circle that touches the back of the mirror is so soft and floppy that it does not hold it up at all. I can fold it up and unfold it in the car very easily, but I spend several minutes trying to get it to stay in the window and to block out the sun at all of the edges. Just when you think you have it propped in the car just right, you close your door and it falls down.  I'd suggest this for a much smaller window. Maybe best for a vehicle, where the circle hoops go from the edge of the window to the mirror.
B00IWS41JI|5|GOOD PRICE SHIPED QUICKLY

B005BHYJUO|3|A little shorter than my original one...
B000VHZHBO|5|works as advertised
B005NLQAHS|5|This OBD reader works terrific with the torque app. It really does a good job finding the trouble codes. It even sends you to a website to explain the issue and how to fix it. For a little over $20 for everything is a hands down deal compared to $200+ you will spend somewhere else.
B0084L0YR6|4|Worked as stated in the ad!
B0067UCPRS|5|It works very good..shipping was fast.

B004GCEZ90|5|Ok
B003ZI7Y5S|1|Did not work as advertised. Let it dry on a 95 degree day for at least 6 hours. After returned home from running errands I had to wax the tire shine off my truck. Do not recommend
B00DWVN08I|4|fits and looks nice
B000A3BXW6|5|Very nice.
B004EDCR0U|1|The rubber is to stiff to accomidate the holder I have.  It's the right shape but rubber chain does not have enough stretch .  On one chain  some of the links broke  I make it work. It's only 10 bucks !
B00GUA9BYK|5|These seem to work as expected.  I used them to replace the existing bulbs in our travel trailer.  The light is much better now.

B00PG3WR6Q|5|Fast shipping. Easy to install and fit perfect!
B00II7WH44|4|Installed on 87 Electra Glide.  They are much smaller than the stock mirrors and took a few rides to get used to them.  They are sleek and very easy to install.
B00NWZ4056|5|Works as it should
B00SIBO6MQ|4|Not bad for the price
B0074ZL828|5|i ordered this grip because i had problems with numb feelings in my hands while riding. this grips have reduced that feeling for lets say 60%<br />they are open end, easy to fit and not bad looking, just wish they were more thicker!
B00FZQ361E|5|Great
B003ZOLC8M|5|Great quality filter.
B00DMTTSIQ|5|bought for my 2015 GMC sierra crew cab, fits like a glove on the floor.

B001DKPMAO|2|Poor quality
B00DT7S73I|5|Excellent fit and durable, I love them.
B00BKTPP96|5|Had to force it on, but worked fine
B000X1XXXC|4|This mat fits perfect just as I expected. I ended up cutting it down because the rear seat In My equinox slides back and forward. Weathertech had this all Figured out and they put a second lip in the mat for when the back seat Is In It's Rear Most Position. since I plan on keeping the rear back I just cut the mat at that lip and it fits perfect. Good job Weathertech.
B0009IQUWU|5|Simple replacement no hassle switching out!
B0009PCPNQ|5|It removed the stains from the Car and carpet. Awesome results.
B00JBI9G7K|5|Awesome product.  No issues.
B00CIOHNOM|3|They are not OEM parts, so they will not have the quality of the original ones. They where stock when I received them. I have to apply some WD40 to make them work. I am not expecting them to hold too long, maybe a year or two, we will see.
B001FRTMOW|4|Looks like the original. It is hard to say how durable it is. I'm still pleased with the product.
B000ALBZTE|5|A perfect match for a 2001 Suburban!
B00B7ADIEC|5|Looks great!
B00F8PSZUE|5|Gooooood
B000924QO0|5|I hope this short review helps you with your shopping. I always depend on them when I shop. OH my gosh. I love this stuff. I use it on our RV and I use it on the truck I use to pull the RV. We are shining when we go down the road. It seals and helps repel water and grime. It is easy to apply. It holds up well. I doubt I will ever try anything else.
B00O0A7X9M|3|I love the smell of these they're great and strong! I get complimented every time someone enters my car and it looks pretty nice to have on my dashboard. But the only downside I dislike is how long the scent last. I'd have it in for about a week, and the smell would die out really fast. These have a door/slide kind of function that let's you open it more or less which controls the scent I guess but I have mine closes which means it doesn't have much air flow to get through yet it still dies out within a week..I also don't like how unsteady it is. I have a really low car and whenever I hit a bump or my car bounces, the whole thing would just come apart hahahahah it's ridiculous
B0016HURK4|5|Awesome
B00B1VBQRS|5|good deal
B00FNUI3PQ|5|The right addition to my system for the right price. Great product.

B00FGR8VVW|5|Works very good on my 07 Yamaha Road Star 1700.
B00DUFC8ZM|5|Keeps my Stang clean just like it was after I washed and waxed it.....others have failed miserably...this one works!<br />Awesom!!
B009XAQZY8|5|I just moved to a city from a tiny village and had no idea where I was - even with a map! This little gem instantly made it possible to drive all over my new metropolis and stay sane. Knowing without a doubt which direction I was headed by looking at my Bell probably saved the few dollars this cost in less gas the first day. It mounted easily with the rubber feet on my dash (I didn't use the sticky tape, just dampened the feet and pushed it down). It has been over 100 degrees here and the Bell is still firmly in place.
B0002SQVL2|5|Got it on time, and was what I expected
B00FRRCDRE|5|Product was as advertised
B00PWYLZ1C|5|A+++++++++

B004BSNNY2|3|Some of the product leaked during shipping. Probably would not recommend buying this over the internet if you live above 3000 feet.
B003SZ3GK0|5|It fit perfectly.
B007O1WXHG|4|Worked very well
B000W0RPYW|1|Wouldn't take much to break it. This is designed to keep an honest person honest. A thief will break it off in seconds.
B003VGHB9I|5|Perfect! Fit 2012 Ram 1500! Thank you
B004TS1VKC|4|it has a good sound and makes my bike run a bit more stable ( 113 cu.in. with se260 cams and cvo 110 heads with port/polish and 10.5:1 pistons)<br />If you don't like the ss pipe turning goldish then either get the powder coated black or have a shop powder coat with ceramic powder of color choice.<br />NIC Industries makes some good color ceramic powder coatings. There is only one drawback that I have with the pipe and that is it does cut down your right side lean angle a little . I scrapped 3 times in 2 days so beware. Other than that its a well made pipe. Well worth the money.
B000TK3U4O|5|Best replacement for OEM Harley Sporty...
B000EGZ5FK|5|Perfect to drain and fill the oil in my air compressor. The tip is small enough to fit snugly in the oil fill hole.
B00CASDZKC|5|Good product and seller.
B0036PUHN6|4|Better quality than expected and like the protective  shroud. The bolts did not line up with my existing hole, so they had be modified.  Fulton makes great product and amazon delivered quickly!
B00068XCQU|5|Tested it by charging my truck's battery.  Works as advertised.  My plan is to use this to tend a car's battery through Wisconsin winters.<br /><br />I would buy this product again.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Nice bright and well made lamps.
B0096J7VAI|4|They work great just hoping for them to be brighter. Red is a darker color. I have the green ones of the same brand and are super bright.
B00L4NHW7Q|5|great quality great price
B001UCGPVU|5|Great fit
B00FA4KVEQ|5|Radiator is great  keeps correct temperature.  Husband was able to install.  Radiator came a day early then was said on shipping.  Very happy with product and shipping
B00MHQBGGC|1|Sent yellow instead of warm white as listed
B000E0KH2M|5|Got here fast, works as advertised
B005PZMKZI|2|The car seats didn't fit well for a 2000 Toyota Camry. The back seats have all these ties to go on the chair to secure it, but there aren't designated holes for the headrest to go through, so I made my own holes. Then the ties can't go past the seats for the back ones because it's not designed that way. My back seats do not &#34;lift up&#34; to be able to connect the ties together. Wouldn't recommend it for a 2000 Toyota Camry, or any car that doesn't have seats that move easily to connect the ties provided.
B00NT5E25W|5|Go Bucks!  Quality sticker!
B002R1NDP4|5|Fit like a champ.  Had no problems installing.  Very pleased!!!<br />This was for my 99 Ford Windstar.
B001AN16WW|4|Nice but not very water proof
B0082ACB8E|2|The latch nearly fell off as I was trying to install it.  The screw holding it together had no nut.  The manufacturer was very helpful in getting the part shipped to fix it.  I am waiting on the part to see if the cover will work. My truck has a plastic top edge cap on the bed.  The cover clamps don't clear the plastic bed edge cap.  I may need to trim the plastic cap so that the clamp doesn't push it up.
B00J0GYNSK|1|First of all, this took so l ong to receive I forgot I ordered it.  Secondly, it's a tedious, tape-nightmare.  I have used Roommates (sold on Walmart.Com) with much more ease and they are even prettier in my opinion and MUCH less expensive . This is NOT a good idea.
B00IACGFOA|5|I like the compact size and the indicator lights but I dont know if it will work for a surge or not until it happens.
B00IFTFDGY|1|Fits great looks great & weighs almost nothing<br />  😏😎😏
B011U1YPJ4|5|great item fast shipper.
B000CERAYS|5|Good item! Purchased it to replace a broken one on my dad's '04 Silverado. So far, so good, works like it is supposed to.
B003WGM4TY|5|Exactly what I wanted. Works great!!!!
B000WN5KF0|1|Wore it once, within 3 miles my crotch was soaked
B0074SNMZG|5|Decal comes as you see it easy to install and it looks great on my Mac
B00LTMULV6|4|Prefect fit.  The throttle linkage was different from my original carb, but the parts were interchangeable.  After a little governor adjustment, I'm back in business!
B000BR3BEY|5|It fits. It works fine. It lasts a long time.  Get one of these.
B00HM14J84|3|I purchased this exhaust a few months ago and was very exited. After I installed the exhaust I was let down it looks good and has an ok sound nothing to write home about! The exhaust has been installed for two and a half months and has already began to rust terribly I'm nervous about what will happen in the winter when there's salt on the ground. It wouldn't be a big issue if the tips didn't rust so quick and cost half of what the system cost to replace them! Over all I would not recommend this product or repurchase this product.
B003XGYDE2|2|It is way to slow.. I just wanted to pump a vehicle tire up from 30 to 35 lbs and it took at least a  a min and a half..I thought buying a more expensive and better quality unit would result in a much shorter air pump time.. I 'm hoping I never have to pump up a very low tire. It says it takes less than 1 amp to run  but it never tells you the actual power rating. I would like to return but I have opened everything up and threw away the packaging. The way I calculate it, its probably around 100watts which is what a typical 100w light bulb uses-- not much
B007RKMV12|5|VERY NICE.
B001U522GO|5|Well made and much safer than a scrub bucket. Seals up to take pre-wash water to the do-it-yourself spray wash.
B0000AY69V|3|This doesn't dry as well as I expected from all the reviews. Perhaps I'm using it incorrectly, but it dries very stiff for me and I have to wet it a little before using it, then it doesn't really pick up all the water. I follow this up with microfiber cloths.
B000GBBP8O|5|Holding my hood up as I type this.
B007DMTGGM|3|worked okay...not as well as original equipment
B001FOLMR0|5|Cool
B00R3O0Y0M|4|These aren't fire engine loud, but I didn't expect that anyways. Installed with the relay on my 1990 miata was a breeze, just took $15 in 14 gauge wire, a couple bolts, and some electrical connectors. Put the relay where the old single horn goes and mounted the Hellas down low facing outwards in front of the radiator (there is a spot just perfect) ground wise, I just grounded the horns on themselves with a loop back to the mount bracket, so make sure your mount is sanded clean. Sound is much louder than my stock horn, and likely louder than any oem horn. They are not dual pitch, one horn is high and one is low tone, so if you want to just use one, I suggest using the high, for a motorcycle application or the like. People certainly notice my little car now. Definitely too loud to stand right in front of the car while you use them, so be careful when installing that your battery is not connected  (for a miata, just use the 12v main like going to the fuse box.)
B00EC2CG9U|5|I used these to secure down my bike on my trunk bike rack and they work perfectly.
B000PA00XM|5|Would this fit my 2003 BMW 745li?
B007KPUFZS|5|Genuine S&S filter, as described.  Fit my Super E's air cleaner perfectly.
B00IICYTDG|5|Sooo gone are the days of me hunting for a big phillips head screwdriver!!! Thank you very much, this little guy is a great thing to have!!
B000C9SUK6|1|Did not match what I wanted, but I made it work anyways.
B004MWOLWK|5|I used this on my Suzuki TU250 and it fits perfectly on the old turn signal brackets that I relocated to the rear. No complaints so far. Item as described.
B001EB9XZC|5|Awesome stuff 
B00NQIEJEG|5|Love it and holds more than I thought it would...it has handles on each end if you need to remove it from your vehicle....and if you have a couple of heavy duty men to pick it up!!!!  This organizer could be used for other storage usages besides in your vehicle.....I would order from them again.
B0084L55GQ|3|99 GMC Suburban 4x4 350 - EBC Green stuff with their rotors. I have a few thousand miles on them now. The stopping power is better than the best pads you get at AutoZone, but with a heavy vehicle, you still aren't going to stop on a dime. I probably won't buy these again because of all the dust, though. Be sure to put a good coat of wax on your wheels. After a few days going to work & back, they need to be wiped down, cause the dust is starting to show. Maybe if you have the black wheels that you can't tell if they're dirty or not.... I've got polished aluminum & it looks really bad if you let it go a week.
B008ZYZOZO|5|as expected
B00KMDNLYC|3|I purchased this kit because I wanted tinted windows but I wasn't super fanatical about paying approximately $200 to get the job done. I had zero experience tinting windows, and this kit was inexpensive and precut, so I figured worst case scenario if I messed it up too bad, I could scrap it all and not be out much money. All together this kit and the tools I needed to buy to install it (heat gun, conquistador squeegee from 44tools, hard card from 44 tools, a platinum easy reach corner tool from 44tools, and a squeegee from Amazon) cost me around $75. The packaging of this item was in bubble wrap and then that was in a cardboard shipping container. It was brought to my house on a rainy day in a plastic bag, the mailman said that it was leaking. Anyway, I guess I'll cut to the chase with some pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Pre cut<br />Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not pre shrunk (I'm pretty sure at least, no one responded to my inquiry about it, I shrunk it with the heat gun anyway just to be safe)<br />On the thinner side, some of the tint got scratched and that doesn't look good in the final install.<br />Not labeled, so it takes some guesswork to figure out which windows the tint corresponds to<br />Not really a problem with the product, but as mentioned above, no one responded to my inquiries about the product.<br /><br />I installed this kit with the help of youtube videos and my brother (who also had absolutely zero experience tinting windows). I would say overall it came out ok, with some air bubbles and the aforementioned scratches in the tint being the giveaways that I did this myself. I can live with those imperfections, but the scratches are more annoying than the bubbles because that is a manufacturing defect as opposed to an installation problem (which is my own fault).<br /><br />I didn't find it super difficult to install, and I feel like if I had some more experience and knew a little better what I was doing that a much nicer finished product could probably be achieved. I would say if you want something quick and cheap like I did, this will get the job done. If you want something on par with a professional tint job, you either need to get it professionally tinted or at least buy higher quality tint. I installed this in a 2002 Accord, so I'm not going to be super picky about the outcome. Plus like I said, neither myself or my brother had any experience installing tint. Given all of that, I'm happy with it. I got a tint job that I can live with for $75, saved some money, and gained some experience. I hope this review helps some people because there were no reviews when I was buying it.
B0071E9NLK|5|ty
B000GZHR14|5|Awesome .. Very easy to install and now I can ride comfortable ...
B00R7QTM04|5|All the protection you need in all the right places. The gloves flex naturally and fit wonderfully... No long thumb on these.
B00F0ZKHPI|5|This is the best seat cover for you money!quality is amazingly surprising! Look very fab interior now! it please the plasti dip interior accent pieces glossy red. You just need to drink a lot of water in advance bec you'll gonna sweat a lot!! :D but its worth every sweat!Highly recommended piece! I've got FRS 2015 RS1 limited edition.
B00QNR2G1U|5|I was very impressed with CafePress. I ordered my plate guard and I found my package in the street , no fault of CafePress, where a car must have rolled over it and broke the plate guard. CafePress sent another one, express delivery, no questions asked....I didn't  even have to send the other one back to prove it and that meant a lot to me. Thank you very much for doing good honest business.
B006DUJWG4|4|Fit right on my 93 accord ex only thing is the pedal feels heavier
B003YCZ1F0|5|For my modular HJC helmet, this works perfectly.  I could se up grading to the next level up Bluetooth module in the future but for right now this fits the bill.  ~Eric
B007JSGR9Y|1|Piece of crap, didn't work, won't read, just sits in reading mode.  2nd reader I have bought. The first at least read the codes but then just died. This one won't die but won't read either.
B00GHT8OHY|5|great product for my Mercedes.
B011GW82LY|4|I have a friend whose daughter has just turned 15 and a half, and you'd think the world has ended every time she has to turn the car off. The problem is she's a lot better driver in her own mind than she is behind the wheel. It's not that she's horrible, she just hasn't developed the skills to be a good driver yet. And that's where this flexible &#34;student driver&#34; magnet comes in. It lets everyone know that her skills haven't yet developed to the point that they can ignore her when she's driving near them. It's good for her safety and for theirs as well. As soon as we put this on her car, we noticed other drivers giving her plenty of room.<br /><br />I received this magnet at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
B00TQ4U7XG|4|It arrived on time and for the most part was exacty as advertised.  Unfortunately umbreon had one ear that wasn't filled in with black.  I don't want to return it since when I bought the item it said there was only one other left in stock.  This may be a fluke, but I'm concerned it made it past the product's quality check.  Other than that I'm highly satisfied with this.
B003ZWGG0I|5|Seems to be holding just fine and looks like the original.
B011AHSYJA|1|Did not fit my jeep

B002E5HMU0|5|This TYC 800105C cabin air filter fit my 2004 Mercedes-Benz SLK320 perfectly.  Instructions for removal of the old filter and installation of the new one were included in the package, which were mostly accurate for my particular model/year, although not a perfect match.  Essentially, you have the remove the panel under the glove compartment, and the panel will have screws in various places that may not match the printed instructions.  Making things more complicated, accessing the panel screws means that you will need to open your door as wide as possible and lie on your back on the carpeting in front of the passenger seat.  A flashlight would be highly recommended.  If you're not sure, I suggest watching YouTube videos to see how to access the panel and the filter mount.<br /><br />In comparing the old, dirty filter to this filter, this filter seems to be of high quality and the right size. It fits tightly (and correctly), although sliding the locks into place in the filter mount was a real pain.  The foam along the edges looks like it would seal the filter in very well, preventing dirty air from sliding around the filtration.<br /><br />Bottom-line though:  replacing the cabin air filter yourself is a real money saver, both in the cost of this item and the labor involved.  It's pretty easy to swap the air filter, it just takes some time and a bit of contortion to get at the panel and then the filter mount.  This is a good replacement for the OEM filter.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Large and easy to use, easy to collapse and store. Much better than the accordion-type protectors.
B002WPXVC0|5|Heavy duty product. Holds bike as planned.

B00W2XFBYS|5|Fit trailblazer SS with small modifications
B000CN988U|5|nice
B001QK1X5O|3|I bought this for my boat trailer but I cannot use it because the hole that it needs to go through is pretty much flush with the trailer and this lock won't go through that hole.  I tried removing the sleeve to make the part that goes through the hole thinner, but the problem is not how big the hole is, but the position of the hole.  I just putting this review, not to complain about the lock but to let people that have an Atwood Surge Brake Actuator know that this is not the lock for them.  I probably should have been able to tell that before I bought this lock, but I did not really look at the locking location too closely before I ordered the lock.  I think I have a friend who has a long skinny lock that looks ridiculous on his trailer.  Maybe we can trade because now I know that I need one of those locks with a 3 1/2 &#34; long shackle. I am giving 3 stars because I did not really use the lock but it seems decent.
B00HJDI22E|2|This light is glued together with a soft RTV-type adhesive. It came apart on a hot day in Florida. The light wasn't even on at the time and the problem was noticed immediately that night with part of the bulb jiggling around inside the lamp housing in the car. Two weeks later, the one on the other side came apart the same way. Expect to use some better glue to keep these together. Works well when it is properly fastened together.
B00880AT9G|5|Not much can be said about this, it just works.<br />I tested it against 2 multimeters and it was spot on.
B00B2YE4B4|4|Very bright (I thought): I installed four in a boat cabin. About 5 minutes later, only three were working, so I don't think they do a burn-in test on them but the other three are still going.
B000WJGLZC|5|Work like it should on my 1987Suzuki gs 450
B000CSPI3E|5|These work the best in my Lawn Boy mower.
B00BGTQ3UU|5|Super cute, real vinyl stickers (cut, not printed), easy to use.
B001NYJOFY|5|Worked great!
B000CODGXW|5|Strong  good quality  works well as tow strap
B00O3OI1ZU|5|Bough this for my laptop DVD external drive to match another on my laptop (and the Triforce Zelda laptop bag - I'm a geek that way!). Looks fantastic and quality is superb.
B00V0UNNVW|5|Bought this because one of my hubcaps fell off. Fit right in. Great quality!! Thank you!!
B000HAUVNO|2|Broken it on there first try if stem was stronger would be better than the thin is almost every day I use it too I use it with center punch on air chisel
B005X97OHA|5|When purchasing, keep in mind, the volume of this cooler is limited to an area commensurate to a medium size paper bag, perhaps large enough for four, twelve ounce cans of soda and a sandwich. Otherwise, if six stars were possible to rate, I'd rate it at six for quiet operation, quality, outstanding construction, ability to control temperature and ability to freeze. This product may be slightly more expensive than others, but if one can outlay a little extra, one would be better off, instead of getting a cheaper unit and having to throw it in the trash after a few uses. I am confident this cooler would serve one for a long, long time. Mine has been flawless with everyday use for nearly a year now.<br />Dometic makes a larger model that is cavernous and as soon as I save some money, I'll get it.<br />I own a limo business and I'll have no qualms getting the larger one, as my current one has been a real gem and runs nearly 24/7/365!
B001P275YG|5|Had to replace my broken lock on my truck and these did just the job. Easy to install and very quick shipping. Would recommend.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Works far batter than I expected, won't fall off and easy to take on and off.  Larger screen a big plus for SUV.  3rd screen great for those really sunny days or traveling (my son is a vampire)
B004TRKBOK|3|Very small, but good heft. Easy to keep in the car at arm's reach.
B000C8ZB1I|3|Not impressed with the hanger bracket that attaches to the body, it's not as good as OEM with the non-flush bolt heads - the bracket bows a bit when you bolt it up. However, the hook & rubber that bolts onto the tailpipe was perfect.
B004LX3AS6|5|Seems to work good thank you
B00IPDQWLK|5|I could not believe that they would so brite, I am using them as 3 rd brake light for my suburban right under the back flip door.<br />Very brite
B001O0XE1M|5|Warehouse deals came through again. Damaged box but the brake pads were perfect.
B000B60A44|5|Works as described and the price from company was awesome
B000BPSVV4|3|Ok, to get rid of the smell (It is horrible), place the steering wheel cover out in the sun for two solid days.  This will help the product off gas the smell.  Yes, it seems silly, but helps reduce the smell considerably.  It did not fit my 2004 Dodge Viper, and coupled with the smell, three stars.  This being said, if they did make one that fit, I would buy it.  I have one on each of my three other cars.  Just get rid of the smell first.
B00ISY9D8K|5|worked.
B004P3RKMO|3|Blocked to much airflow with the switches. Switches have to have wiring.
B00279B196|5|Worked perfect for my 2006 VW GLI with the 2.0T FSI motor.
B00T9H5IBQ|5|For the price, the quality is amazing! Super bright, easy to install. Highly recommend.
B003VARIY2|4|Great, was easy to use and so far we have not had any leaks. It has only been about 6 months, but we are optimistic.
B00MKZXN6Q|5|Very high quality. I'm very pleased with this product. I bought cheaper ones originally for my 2013 Silverado 2500HD. Half didn't work and the others started flashing and quit within a year. You can definitely see a difference in quality. I would recommend JDM to everyone. I even have white JDM LEDs for my license plate lights and are just as awesome.
B001Q8DMIW|5|I love this towels they work great and last  while.
B00IO977DW|4|Seller contacted promptly after purchase to ask details about car and confirm fit.<br />Packaging and was adequate and shipping was quick. Arrived on time.<br />Has been on my bmw 323ci E46 for a few weeks now and they look good, and work as intended.<br />No complaints. Very happy with price and product for now. Will have to see how they behave over the long run.<br />Based on my experience I would recommend the product.<br /><br />For you future purchasers, to save you some time here is the info you will need to install. The shipment comes in a large box, with each part in its individual box with an id#. but this id is different from the bmw official part #. I had to measure the rotor size to make sure which ones are rear and which ones are front.<br />Rotors: Here are the respective id #'s on the individual part box, and were valid as of summer 2015.<br />-Front:<br />AIM:34064<br />RAY: 96780<br />D781<br /><br />-Rear:<br />AIM: 34228<br />RAY: 980195<br />D763<br />-The rotors are marked left and right. And just to clear some of your's confusion,  Drivers side is left and passenger side is right.<br />- Brake pads, as a rule of thumb for e46 larger pads go in the front and smaller one in the rear<br /><br />Hope this helps!
B00AUMCVWI|5|Worked as expected.
B00NMR1C1Y|5|ok
B00S1ZS5NU|5|👌🏻
B00XPP9TV8|5|Arrived the next day, perfect fit, my gf loved it. No complaining here. A nice touch to her car for $6.
B00HJXXIT6|5|Wonderful my new car is scratch free I love the way it wraps around the entire bumper
B005CLPFMA|1|Did not work for my model of car. I thought it said it was for a 2007 versa but maybe I read it wrong. Something about the connection pieces did not line up.
B0013FDEEU|5|Just like the one from factory
B00EHE8RPA|5|Got to replace my metal one due to heat, a lot cooler. Can properly touch the shifter while driving instead of burning my hand with the metal one.
B0024NWRLQ|5|Just what I needed
B00KWQRC4O|3|Excellent
B00VW0GLSC|5|Initially would not communicate with my truck. A call to SCT and they updated the tuner for me. Works great!
B000RXNLK6|5|Love this stuff! Just need a quick cleanup? Use this product!
B0040IV0Y8|5|As good or better than the original!
B005EL3SFO|5|Nice bag
B00L2OTTPU|5|Its a lug nut.. its the same as the factory subaru sti lug nuts for 2013
B0010E00T6|4|Perfect fit. Feels premium, and my car smells fresher with it in. Not sure if it's psychological, but I do detect a slight baking soda fragrance.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Worked like a charm. Used it for a 2 hour trip and it started raining most of the way there. Everything inside stayed completely dry
B00RE4ZBC2|4|they are great if you use a rubber gasket with them which you did not send oh well
B005GT6EZ0|4|Added this to my boat's steering wheel. Had to replace the sticky pad with a velcro strip since it does need to be adjusted every once in a while. It should really come with velcro.
B006BZIGL8|1|But ford... They didn't last a month
B000WP8QV8|4|Cleaner look then stock when riding without the passenger seat
B001GH0EYI|5|Awesome high quality sticker to show peace and pride!
B007KTINZI|5|My husband loves this stuff. He says it saves him hours on cleaning of bugs
B000GU5H9I|5|Good
B000JFL8V6|5|great product
B007V5BY8E|5|What a great piece of hardware! Pretty easy to install and it works great. I would recommend over the bolt on version.
B004X973EA|5|Works great in the 5-spd trans in my '00 Softail Deuce. The &#34;Harley clunk&#34; has been drastically reduced.
B003SS62PS|4|Good fan for the price. Came in perfect condition and helps cool down my Tundra for the hot south Texas days.
B003808EWA|3|I installed the K&N kit 5 weeks ago, loved the sound. My gas mileage increased from 17.2 to 18.4 mpg. Suddenly the mileage started to drop. It is now 17 mpg and dropping, any ideas what could of happened? I checked the connections and the crank case vent hose had to be tightened, everything else was ok. HELP
B000RH20T0|5|Just the right space for all the necessities. Compact but a lot of room. Nice weekender.
B00NLQTEWA|5|TE BEST..... #1 BRAND
B00CWKT552|4|arrived quickly and works
B0012ZITJQ|3|Not bad. Wouldn't buy again tho. Because the products are not that amazing. The polish is worth it, works great.
B00HESPG9Q|4|very good quality
B0096J90KW|5|Very Bright!
B001LTVCBU|5|Really great towels that dry perfectly without leaving towel scratches on nice paint.  Haven't found another towel that works half as good.
B004RFKBEO|5|Directions are not good, and a few pieces had to be drilled, but it works well and is easy for transporting bikes.
B003QHDLEQ|4|This was a gift to my son it was well  received
B00EJ25TX8|5|Looks just like the pic! Oorah!!!
B00AC6YSD2|5|Excellent. As described. Fast ship. Great price.
B008B5U0S8|5|Worked just like the original.
B00WGORBZ0|5|It fits our 2014 Corvette  Stingray  perfectly, and looks wonderful.
B000ARTZPE|5|This is a real octane booster.
B000CF8W1W|4|Fit and work perfectly for '12 Tacoma quad cab.  Be careful; double-sided tape was not trimmed well, and some scrap was stuck on the wrong side of the in-channel mounting surface.  Needed to be inspected and carefully removed before installation.
B00A8MZ7IA|4|Overall good towel.  They do leave towel scratches so i only use them when damp or soaked in solution.  Use the Cobra (purple towels) if you want the best drying/buffing towel around.  It's more expensive but worth it.  These are perfect for interiors and damp wiping, but beware of towel scratches on black or dark paint.
B000182DO2|5|Worked out great
B00TT3LGHU|2|Loved them. .. 2 1/2 months later the Orange is faded and looks grey
B002YCEIRS|4|Replaces oem fine. No problems
B002BEI0JQ|5|It works very good .
B003CWLMUK|5|Great fitting cover!  Fit our 540i snug.
B00HLUSGRG|5|Great fit!!! Good ventilation
B0083G3AXC|4|A little cumbersome but it works.
B0009IQXJ0|3|ok
B001C6QUT6|5|Shipped fast and worked great. No issues whatsoever
B0009VIQ1A|4|Magic wand
B00C4XFMO0|5|good
B00MNQUBRG|5|Everything fit as advertised......looks great.....very satisfied
B00N4TXEGQ|5|Great sticker fast shipping!
B0002UEMZ2|4|Comes in handy
B00LEBLI82|5|We used them as replacements in our camp trailer.  We were very pleased how well they work and how much light they give off!
B000C545VI|5|great product, great price
B007HOG8R6|5|No one has messed with my bike since I put this lock on it. Yes, its heavy, because it is big, which is why no one messes with my bike.<br /><br />You do need to be careful that the U Lock doesn't hang down and touch the back tire while you are riding though. It will shift while riding if you don't wrap it tightly.
B005LDBU0U|5|confortable
B00U0YNMS8|1|Defective on arrival. Tossed in the trash. Get another OBD-2 scanner.
B00APN8YTQ|4|Good looking and very comfortable..
B000AA4RWM|5|Good price
B00LBWA3VW|1|I ordered this item and its terrible!! the color doesn't even match. What you see on the website isn't the same once you received it via mail. Very Dissapointed!!
B00ASY5PIA|5|The dealer asked me to leave the car to be diagnosed, and I decided to come home and  look it up an the internet. Turned out that it was a very good move, got the air spring fast and my mechanic installed it in 45 minutes at a great price. YES, the problem was solved a lot easier than I imagined. Happy ending!!!
B000GV1R3C|5|Replacement for prior kit of same make and model that was destroyed in a rollover. Good price.
B001DKRGQ2|5|Exact fit and so all is well for now.  Jeep 4.0 liter is still running fine.  Had to replace the radiator and water pump, water pump inlet tube, thermostat, upper rad. hose, coolant.  But now will relax and enjoy people saying how they like the little red truck.
B00P2MZLJQ|3|I may be using it wrong but I've tried all the directions and reviews online and its not working for me like it does supposedly for others. It was cheap so I use it. I use it more as a lube just in case I missed a part with the washing so I don't drag the dirt all over the car.
B00W5WY642|2|It was a sticker...not a sign.  I was very disappointed, I would not have bought a sticker, it was for a gift so I was upset..the title is very misleading
B00G7SKMES|5|great fit
B00BTLEIIY|4|Covers are great quality, look great and are comfortable to sit on. Durable. Only drawback was a little difficult to install but overall very pleased with the installed product.
B000CB7GAY|4|They worked fine for my truck. I used them to replace the factory originals and I didn't noticed much of a change in the ride of my truck.
B0002STSTE|5|Very nice product fast shipping
B00OPYHFWS|1|I wish I had known the &#34;reflective&#34; was the sticky side....kinda defeats the purpose doesn't it? I'd like to build a time machine and go back in time right before this purchase.
B005VCLKL0|4|Looks good, very light weight, but NO batteries...really, for $28 batteries should have come in the box....under tech specs by the way in the ad it says the word included....buyer beware
B000E3220O|5|Worked like it should
B000BR6WCC|5|Have a 3.4l 2004 impala w/ 250,000 original miles bare bones not even ABS!  With the filter I noticed the throttle response is quicker than before.
B009K2QXB4|4|does the job
B001DKO5VQ|5|Excellent product.  Fits gauge like a glove.
B00L1S0JU6|5|No joke when they say BIG towel! It is huge, and dries my car very well without leaving additional moisture like I find wrong with other microfiber towels I have used in the past! Speedy delivery and I am extremely happy with this purchase!
B000E2AQQW|4|I like this product, but I was surprised by the fact that it is open on both ends. I feel like it would be FAR BETTER to be closed on one end.
B001JT5R4U|5|Meets my expections.
B00IQ2WTGM|5|Love this scent.  It's not to strong and smells very clean.  Can't find it in the auto stores were I live so I ordered it online.  Love it!!!
B000WZC4V6|5|Time saver...
B00J4XH8R2|5|Awesome
B000GD5FMY|5|These are awesome! If you have trouble with high beams or street lights at night make sure you order a set with the yellow lenses. Otherwise, these are perfect. Do not wear the dark lenses at night. I carry the other in my vest pocket (in case I am out during the day and it gets dark, I can switch them out and good to go). They fit well and keep most of the wind out of your eyes.
B00J622WP4|1|Ordered an XL Helmet. Way too small for my head. Goggles are a joke.Trying to return for a refund but NO reply. Buyer beware
B00G733U10|5|Just what I needed, came fast.
B00AF4963I|5|Perfect!
B0031EL7SG|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE these mats.
B000ET5264|5|very handy and good price. works great
B00E9FSPE0|5|Perfect Product!  Solved my problem. Great Shipping.
B00498DSM6|5|Always a fan of the Gates rubber product family. And when I needed a new serpentine belt for the Odyssey, Amazon had a great price and did not disappoint my expectation to receive product by weekend so I could take care of the belt replacement as well as a few other tasks on the car.
B00H5B9KCQ|2|Don't waste your money on these the little plastic ring kind works way better
B00J8DPFKA|1|although they say it will fit a large pickup, it does not cover all that it should and because of its size the end of the cover going over the back end of the box is tearing. not worth what I paid for it.
B00230R2JW|5|Good product. Fast shipping.
B00O0SRAK6|4|one of the blue ones doesn't work all the time but great for the price. put them in my grill and they look good
B009LZQV3U|5|Did it's job for my 2008 Accord V6. Perfect fitment and the heads seem sturdy enough to resist stripping. Same goes for the thread.
B0000ATZD5|5|Easy to use and seems well made.  I like the set ups versatility.  Crook would have to be pretty determined to get my spare off.  Ordering 2 more for my kids trucks.
B00LP0C91M|5|Fit, and on time thanks
B007KPSQT0|5|This is the best thing to have for anyone that has a bike it works so good.
B00UADG1WI|5|I have a 1999 Lexus ES300 and these work perfect. They fit snug which is good. The sellers really took care in this product. Every coil pack was individually wrapped.
B007VXCYXA|5|shipped immediately, easy install. Just as I expected.
B000X21YM8|5|Perfect fit in our 2014 Cadillac ATS and it looks great.  After 6 mos it is holding up quite well.
B005SUTZ76|5|Had to file a small groove so the collar fit tight. But after that it fit and worked great!
B0094A6UUQ|5|These are of very good quality and fit perfectly with my Rabbit. Very nice seller.
B00DDYNUC0|3|Assembles pretty easily, nice fit. I think the price is a little high for 2 piece of plastic that you have to put together.
B002OQ8PV4|5|Exactly what I was looking for and showed up earlier than I expected
B000IG20RW|1|Melts at 100 degree. Does not stay in pto shafts. Does not recommend.
B000FFQVV2|5|work great on a frontier
B000O16LJY|5|Great tool, easy to use and time the engine
B00G620ZVU|4|Haven't have them very long but so far so good.  Bright lights!
B00DPMTZLA|1|There is nothing wrong with the cord. I could not see the connection end of the cord on the picture and ordered the wrong cord. I can not use this one to connect to my battery tender cords
B000MK2B8C|5|Great product turns your 6.5 foot bed to 8 foot when you need it
B00DSD7J00|5|As advertised
B002NI0NQI|5|I bought this hook and loop package to use in my car. I have a home made mount for my GPS. I had used industrial strength hook and loop and it worked quite well, until summer. I live in the Mojave desert and I found that the Stickem on the industrial strength stuff would lose it's bond. It's August now and & with this new, high-temp stuff, nothing has fallen off yet. The actual grip of the hook and loop isn't as powerful as the industrial stuff I had before, but it's plenty good enough for my application. The main thing is that my patches are staying stuck to the dash.
B00OZ1FI5W|4|Little trouble programing
B004VO7BUS|5|I have already done this once, but ok.  I really liked the look of the decals and installed them with a few modifications. The final results turned out better then I expected. The instructions were very clear and the final look surpassed what I had expected. I installed them on my hood and hope that they stand up. Very pleased with the product, and would recommend it to anyone.
B00ORWXIDI|1|not what i expected
B00EPDLS2W|5|Looks great. Use a lock or it will be gone.
B008GUESF4|5|Great reliable alternative to Ford OEM parts.
B008G2VL0W|5|worked good
B00LNOK4E4|2|They would work for fog lights but not impressed with brightness at all.
B000CLQQVE|5|Everything needed to overhaul your Mororcraft 2100.  Would have been nicer to include a new metal float...
B001TJ59UM|5|AAAAAA+++++++
B000C57LZ0|5|Great shocks! Much better ride
B00062Z2CS|5|nice
B000LV7XQM|5|they are wipers...they work better than the OEM ones on my Porsche.  buy them
B004O2QXBU|5|Perfect fit and easy install.  All the hardware fit and I couldn't be more pleased.  It took about 20 min to install.
B001EWWFK6|4|they are not as wide as I would of liked them. good sturdy mats though.
B003QSDSFW|5|BE very careful putting these on your lights. The lip that this snaps onto is very fragile. I broke mine and had to buy a new housing just to install these. ONCE on they look dope
B004QEQIN4|3|Works so far, took longer to get the part than I thought it would.
B008PW2DAU|5|Worked well, my 2001 pathfinder was having idle problems where the car would just die at a stop sign or red light.  Swapped this in and now I'm all set!
B000BTCWS8|5|Awesome
B001OCXI2U|5|everything went great
B001TIZZVQ|5|After reading the reviews, I was worried about the fit of this product. I own a 2010 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, and these fit perfectly. There are formed to the contours of the Jeep very nicely! I also read that these where hard to install on the hooks of the floor board; while they do fit snug, they was no trouble whatsoever to install. You will not be disappointed by these slush mats.
B00SH33WJ8|2|The bulbs came in 2x2 packs.<br /><br />ALL BULBS: All bulbs seem to be connected only loosely to the base.<br /><br />One of the 2 packs: One of the two metal leads were too short to function properly on both bulbs. This is a manufacturing flaw that should be readily obvious to anyone performing even the most cursory visual inspection. No quality control here.<br /><br />If you buy these bulbs, you are running the risk of getting less than 4 working bulbs.
B00HVHNP5C|5|Great!
B00K1JVSMY|5|Fits perfectly in my Subaru Impreza 2015 wagon
B0089ISD5O|5|Great cover at a great price.  Love it.  Great fitment.
B004A6GX3S|1|1 star. The product is good but they failed with the shipping box. See photos!
B000COBBSO|3|helps trouble situation.
B00EVMT6A8|5|I've had these on my car for about 7 months and I am pleased so far. They really help minimize blind spots.
B000OUXA2Q|5|This saves me a lot of money than buying the white pack one.  Tested some by adding some water, the silica gel does turn pink when it's fully saturated.  I haven't test the recharging yet but I'm sure it will do fine.<br /><br />[Update] I put the silica gels in small plastic food containers (I pierced holes on all sides except the bottom).  They are placed in my gun cabinet and ammo box to keep things dry.  They lasts about a month until 80-90% of the silica gels turned pink.  I live in the sunny central California, I wasn't expecting too much humidity and I thought they will last a bit longer in which I was wrong.  To recharge the silica gel, I put them in a cooking pan and turns the stove on the low fire setting. It took 15 minutes to turn them into a solid blue. I'm very happy with this product.
B00MWQ6J7S|5|Installed them on my 2015 Chrysler 200S on the interior and license plate and they worked and fit perfectly, no errors and they dim.  They are like most LED bulbs and are polarity specific so before you say they don't work flip the bulb.
B005JU5ZYC|1|I am giving this product one star not because is bad. Is probably a great product if the fitment description was correct. This item does not fit my vehicle. I double checked and Bosch's web site does show that is fit so it is not Amazon's fault it is Bosch that needs to get their act together.
B000S0KY8A|5|This is a great product and saves having to swap balls or have multiple receiver hitches laying around
B0002Z9NPQ|5|ok
B000EPY0FW|5|got these for my 2005 Toyota Avalon and love them.  Fits prefect looks awesome.
B0001EFSTI|3|Great product, no place to put a key ring permanently
B006XCJKJG|1|would not take the lugs off of my car worst craftsman product i ever had save up money for an ir or snapon imppact dont buy this
B00J6ZIJ6W|5|The Reese 21343 Quick Loading Ball Mount 6000 LBS meets all my expectations and I have been using it to pull my utility trailer behind my Chev. Traverse with great success.
B003WZPP50|5|Drum brakes. Always need another tool to make the job easier.
B001Q8DMIW|5|just what every car owner needs.
B000C32J36|3|Broke with in 1,000 miles.
B0013RIOMK|5|F*cking awesome! Looks great, decent price and changes the feature of the car in seconds! Must buy
B00FY80T9A|5|I bought 2 of these to turn off the annoying service airbag warning light. Simple to install....remove positive post from battery terminal, wait 30 mins to be safe, then remove 4 15mm bolts from the plastic skid cover, pull orange lock, push up yellow connector, remove sensor with a 10mm open end wrench. Replace all in reverse. Stand clear of vehicle & start SUV to check. I have 2 OBD scanners & neither did SRS codes. I gambled & bought 2 sensors, figured if 1 was bad the other was going soon too.<br /><br />Now please take note: the 2008 Yukon XL Denali had 2 builds. My SUV had a build date of 1/08 as noted on the ID sticker inside the drivers door. I assume anything built after 1/08 is the 2nd build. The 2nd build takes this Dorman 590-224 stamped 25896408. The 1st build of these vehicles take the Dorman 590-203 stamped 15854647.
B005SEJTUA|5|Been using Royal Purple for years in my old Miata, it's the best oil out there and I love being able to buy it in a big jug, much less plastic waste with only one bottle instead of 5. Price is right too. This is not cheap oil no matter where you buy it but the Amazon price is right in line with local stores.
B00008J2DP|3|I bought this to use for my car, however the 2 prongs the Master Lock has makes it difficult to lock the wheel. (Not impossible). I bought it for a small car BMW Z3 so maybe it might be good for a bigger car.<br /><br />I had a traditional &#34;club&#34; but gave it away. Wish I would have bought the &#34;club&#34; instead.
B000Q86IQQ|5|Great product
B00BRF2QD6|1|This orange one with 3 a/c outlets has been discontinued. If you order it you will get this one with 2 a/c outlets:  [...]  Amazon still calls it \\"600\\"  and has the wrong photo. It's now called Duracell Powerpack 1300, but it's still 600 watts.  http://www.amazon.com/Duracell-600-Watt-Powerpack-Pro/dp/B009YR00MI/ref=pd_sim_sbs_263_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1534CY548TEGAXQFH84F
B00E9BECU0|5|Adds that special BLING to ur truck..
B000IG20S6|5|Product delivered on time and meets all expectations.
B00435MNGM|2|It's a decent wax. Goes on very easy, also came off after one rain and a single washing. Did nothing to enhance the color or finish overall. Way to soft and came off way to easy.
B004FP5FF6|5|Great bumper sticker! The quality is very good and the size is perfect for the back of my car. I ordered other stickers from different websites, but they were not sized well nor as good of quality as this one. Great sticker, and I love the design too!
B007OXCIB0|5|Nice custom look
B000C0YA9U|1|Did not fit on Datsun 240Z ..... wrong information of seller
B000E2AQXU|5|This fit my 2008 Yamaha FJR1300A perfectly.
B00F3J2FW4|5|Better price than MOPAR overstocks.
B007KXGHM0|5|Looks great on jeep easy to install
B00NWF6A7M|4|Everything seems to be working properly.  I had a local garage program it for $38.  It works great.
B004WMDXRE|5|I believe this is a much better door handle that came standard on the car! Very pleased!
B000EQ1D6K|1|Not coated Black as showing
B00D5O49IW|5|The Car Cover fitted very well, was made from quality materials and it also arrived 1 day before the expected date. I live in Hawaii so to get what I paid for in a timely manner is what I appreciate. Keep up the Great work people! Aloha
B00189BJWU|1|Go to Walmart and get a plastic trash can lid for 3$
B00877DBKY|5|Very happy with my purchase! I put them on the back Windows of my 2003 Nissan 350z. I actually received 3 instead of 2 stickers (assuming the seller was feeling generous or made a mistake lol) they look great on my car and I gave the extra to a friend.
B00ZZO01Z0|5|These bulbs are pretty nice!!! They burn very cool & don't have a hard blue tint to them. I purchased the &#34;white&#34; not &#34;warm white&#34; to replace my 1003 bulbs in my travel trailer hoping they'd be brighter than the warm white which I think they are. Also changed my outside light since it doen't get hot hopefully won't attract insects. It came in decent time & evey bulb worked I tool a couple pics & highly recommend!
B002UZSKZK|3|OK, except that the plastic loop waistband tighteners are far too flimsy and broke easily. Also they are not made in different leg sizes, and as such are too short for me. The zippers on the linings at the bottom of the legs (inside) will dig into your leg if you wear boots over the top if you don't put them on carefully
B000QINQKM|1|wrong one, I asked for the front grill
B00D7JKN12|1|I was excited to recieve this product. I finally found a LED DRL that would compliment my 2007 Explorer. I had these installed professionally at a shop here in Michigan. On day one, they looked great and was I very satisfied. On my way home from the shop, another Explorer stopped me and wanted to know where I got this product from. It looked that good!<br /><br />Anyways, long story short, not even a week later, the drivers side LED started suffering from condensation. I was highly disappointed. Now with the condensation inside, the light pattern shines different. The condensation causes the distinguishable 4 led holes to merge as a single line of light. I bought these specifically because of the look and gap of the 4 LED spots. If i wanted a solid LED bar, i would of bought one. Now I am stuck with a defective light, also if i do get a replacement, I am going to have to pay the shop again. Very disappointed, would not recommend this product. One light works perfect, the other is junk!<br /><br />The Picture of the condesation inside the light was taken 3 days later after the install.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE**** the picture of my truck in the driveway was taken on DAY ONE, when there was NO condensation. Thats how its supposed to look, 4 Distinguishable LED's
B00DSD7PTU|5|Looks fabulous on my guitar
B0002STRPO|5|Worked on my 1993 Land Cruiser, much better choice than the OEM one which costs considerably more.
B0040M30U6|5|A nice little touch to any car for a real cheap price. A year later it hasn't broken, it's not foggy, it was a perfect fit.
B0031XULF2|3|Sturdy and easy to use as a security deterrent.  However, not long enough arms to reach ground as a chock especially on cement.
B00A82JNRQ|5|Installed these in a 2001 Grand Marquis to replace the original 9007s. Found these to cast very good light down the road and work very well. It's hard to compare them to the bulbs they replaced, since the ones that were replaced were originals from 2001 and had dimmed badly. It does take a little bit to get used to the color of the beams on the edges since the left most side is a tad yellower while the rest is a nice white color.
B00KHP7E3O|5|I have a 2009 Ford Escape and this works perfectly with it. I live in the country and often need to drive around the property at a low speed, getting in and out of the car to take care of things, and hated the seat belt dinging chime. I keep this in my car and it solved my problem perfectly.
B011EPYS0W|5|Great deal.  Fast service.  Works great.  Easy to follow instructions for quick and easy programming
B0041DX7E8|1|beware this is not the picture of the product that will come in the box
B00T7GYGRQ|4|Great construction pretty bright. Keep in mind it's a cheap led light. That said I don't use it often and it's perfect for me
B006BAQ6Y2|1|This worked for one lock then mever worked again
B00WYTZ8B6|5|Fits nicely on your sun visor even when the visor is up.  The plastic is sturdy.  It slides up and down easily.
B0053HPFDW|3|Good product but breaks easily
B00Q0C8G4Y|4|Best windshield ever, adjust to fit your needs.  The shocks are well made and hold the windshield in place when tipped out.  Instructions are the only downfall.
B009S4SYP2|5|One of those great little tools to have in your stash of bike tools. Easy to use, and OTC quality.
B001LU0YS6|5|Very good but dhl in my country they didnt take it down from the airplane and the pakage delye 3 days
B00RGKW66I|3|The light is super bright! I appreciate the sliding mounts on the base of the light, made it incredibly easy to mount the light. Looks terrific on my jeep. Upon wiring I found out that 3 of the LED's on the lower right side do not work. It is bright enough that it isn't really noticeable!
B0072QNFEI|5|Fits perfectly on my '99 Civic SI. Centers on to the stock bumper and comes with 2 self-tapping screws for use on the inner wheel wells.
B00BOU76PC|5|Great product!!
B00B1SLVQ2|3|Didnt work good for me personally
B003C01FD6|5|Works well
B000C0AJM2|4|seems heavy duty, easy to install,<br />packaging was sloppy so check for nicks before installing
B00K3AB6YG|5|Did the job properly!
B003125LWQ|5|They look great. Installation was rather straight forward. The clips, inside the housing, were the only tricky part. However, they were not that difficult once you removed one. Very well made.
B00076XPHM|5|My son is very proud to have it on his vehicle.
B00MZWX6H0|5|First time using a connector like this and I was impressed with the quality and ease on putting these together... Great Product
B00GBRXXN2|5|Works great and it saved me at least $100 very worth the price!
B001UN78H4|1|not what expected
B00D9C2CDO|5|Absolutely love this cargo bag! We drove through rain with it on and all of our luggage was kept dry!
B00YQA4BU0|3|Sizes: I wont say they run big, but it is just a tad big for me. (I'm 5'7 with the 30&#34; inseam, 30 waist). I believe they are meant to go over pants or shorts. That is how i wore mine and they seem to fit best.<br /><br />Quality: It's ok. Just as the 3 stars indicate. I haven't had them a week and the cloth that held down the velcro straps and completely torn loose on the left side. so i cant adjust it down to my 30&#34; waist any more. now it fits about 32 probably. That really irritated me at how quickly it tore.<br /><br />Protection: i like the hard pads in the knees. The rest is like hardened foam. In a high side fall, i think it'll hold up. In a low side fall/slide I think it'll tear apart but the pads will mostly hold up.<br /><br />Overall: Decent price for decent product. I would get it for someone just trying out/learning to ride. Definitely wouldn't get it as a more experienced rider or someone trying to push the limits of the bike. This will likely tear apart.
B00TEUH0MS|5|Looks nice on my rear windshield.
B007Q8ETTC|4|Good product if you plan to get really messy, such as wet hobbies like, frequenting the beach, camping, snow skiing.  Or even if you just want to keep the matts clean. CAVEAT: -  You must remove your existing matt or it will not fit well….will not latch in place. -  The door side edges are prone to roll, you may have to “train” it to stay where you want.  Otherwise the side door compartment with train it to not lay flat.  So watch that area an push it back down once the door is closed.  WeatherTech also has great Customer Service MADE IN USA
B003UXZ6RG|5|Looks awesome, just has that new smell/feel still. It has me washing my hands after i drive, but it is slowly going away. haha
B000K1PKFY|4|Works well as expected & price & delivery was right
B00CQBZ6X2|5|they did real good,no more brake noise,thank you
B00LSDUSSW|5|cant wait to put it on
B00R56YSAK|5|Original equipment
B00CLBTHJ6|5|Come on!  For the price these look absolutely amazing.  I bought an extra pair for the back seats.  They look great.
B000FQ07RU|1|These did not fit on my '98 Jeep Cherokee (XJ); the open end where it attaches to the leaf spring is too narrow. Wound up buying a set of poly bushings for my stock shackles and going that route instead.
B00V89ZW8C|3|they're really bright yes.<br />but not the color i ordered.<br />they turned out to be greenish/blueish (they changed colors when moved around and or tilted)<br />although i like that it preforems it not the color i wanted, i had asked for pure white~<br />the right lamp is a spare 6000k bulb from my truck.<br />the left one in the photo is the 5000k i ordered (which looks green).
B00065ZIJ2|5|I bought this for my son for his old 1966 VW Bug. They were no shipping problems, it works and he's happy with it.
B007KCXDRI|5|Great price.  Great product.  Period.
B000EVU8MK|5|What can I say it works. Made of sturdy material, not heavy duty but still a great device, beats using a screwdriver.
B006H34BUY|3|Not bad
B00HLW18T2|4|Received 2 modules for 1 order which is what I was expecting. Box was small but It did include both lights and all of the mounting hardware. The LED's run at 15W and not 27W as advertised.<br /><br />They say 27W because the LED used inside are CAPABLE of 3W. However they are only driven at 1.5W ea.<br /><br />It is a 30 degree Semi-flood light. NOT a true spot light. A spot light is around 10 degree beam. This is more of a flood than anything.<br /><br />Overall a very good light so far with the 30 minutes that they have run. Very bright even for only 15W. I am thinking of pulling them apart and changing out the sense Resistor to drive them at the full 27W if they can maintain a low temperature with the heat-sink.<br /><br />- Electrical engineer for Solid State Lighting.
B004A35K76|4|QUICK SERVVICE AND WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL.
B003EOZGY4|4|door is great but straps to hold door from swinging open to far are to  long . door will swing open to hit front fender. also inside door handle way to tight-oiled it and it still is hard to open. the height for resting your arm is great. it also was the best buy for the money
B00FQ6JXU6|5|Great price, on time delivery and my car runs 100% better.
B001GF3QQI|5|Not Covercraft/Amazon's fault so to say but make sure you are getting the right one this is for older TLs, not the newer 4G (2009-2014+) models.  After sending back and getting correct one I am happy with the product.  I am certain this one performs just as well as the correct one on the correct model of car.
B000CM2VQM|5|Easy to use and fit perfectly
B005BNP7YU|5|Looks great but made of plastic, not sure how long that's going to last.
B004J9LC96|5|Great product
B00D44SZ42|5|Works and fits like OEM.
B00P2D415K|4|They work, however had to modify my tail lights on my Harley.
B00TYZL0VU|5|As advertised

B0000AY4YT|5|Used this on a boat I bought and worked awesome!
B002PQU4PI|5|Fit the 2002 Maxima SE perfectly.  Look good. Great seller.
B004IY9HVW|5|Just as the ad said,I couldn't be happier
B001IGBIRE|4|Item was as described. Thanks
B00Y5EVYTS|5|There work real nice thanks
B00DOV4U30|5|PERGECT PERFECT HIGH QUALITY HEADERS THERE CAR SOUNDS LIKE A BEAST MY SRT8 RUNS BETTER AN JUST MORE FUN TO DRIVE THANKS AGAIN FORVA HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT
B0040CYTRY|5|Perfect fit, other than the fact I only needed 8 and I got 100 but was exactly what I needed.
B00AQ29FOY|1|Broken tab on one. Over all cheap quality ( You get what your pay for.) Would have cost me almost as much to send back as I paid for them.
B00LIBF4Q0|1|It does not fitted the Hyundai Tuscan,  return them
B00TFZYD2W|4|still had to drill rims out to make fit
B0085LTTC6|5|Beautiful<br />A must have.

B000M8NZ8E|5|Works great!
B00TUEIICO|5|Just as described. Looks awesome
B004J2IHNW|5|Just take out and take in... Save you a ton of work.
B002RSIK4G|5|It is very helpful to fix the leak for my RV roof. The binding looks so smooth and beautiful on the finished surface than the previous ugly one with self leveling liquid EPDM by RV repair shop. I would order more in case need it and recommend to friends.
B003VLBPJA|5|It was exactly what I expected, delivered on time, works as expected
B00BL3I77S|5|Very easy to install
B0050DC5RI|1|Had to return it. Did not fit my bike.
B002UC18HU|5|IT FIT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,IT IS PERFECT.THANK YOU
B000CSQHQQ|3|Haven't had the engine long enough to evaluate.
B003VBGGU8|5|I like the easy and handy clips.  Great for hanging items on my awning.
B0081O9PU8|5|very good
B003CH3Z8W|4|ok
B000M8R0QM|5|Just what I wanted and quick and easy to use.
B0022ZQZMS|5|Thank you
B0009339DI|5|Exactly what I needed for my UPS.  I had one bad battery that I finally isolated and now my UPS works like new.
B004AJ34I2|3|Seems well made, high quality, even comes in a nice carry bag.  The main problem I have with it is that it is not the advertised 3.5&#34; in diameter, it is a few mm narrower, so it didn't fit my application.
B001NAQRFI|4|Have a 2009 Lancer GTS (CVT) and everything fit, but had to force some parts in cause they did not align perfectly. Other than that installation was easy. Looks and sounds good.
B0041DX8JM|5|Install is easy but make sure you clamp the metal window clamp sleeve (the part that clamps onto the glass)  in Exactly the same location as the old one was clamped.
B000MIUJNI|5|Makes my job go so much easier
B005CLMEHE|5|Fit perfect. Very easy to install
B00IPKETZO|5|Delivered as described.  Looks original.
B00092893E|5|Ran a couple of bottles through my 2001 Chevy Z71 truck. It has 207,000 miles on it. Fuel system and injectors never serviced. Only a couple of fuel filters and 1 fuel pump replacement. Noticed an improvement in performance and mileage. I didn't do a mileage test but it seems I gained 3 or 4 mpg.
B000GZEK00|5|Direct plug and play with appropriate oxygen sensor tool.
B00F0DW88E|5|Works great on cleaning and removing bird poop from my wicker furniture.
B00C7PWEOQ|5|Great product would highly recommend for any diesel
B001FONOLW|3|Will not completely cover mask rock chips and scratches, but keeps it from getting any worse, i.e., rusting.
B00FRHOJYE|5|They work like description said they would.  Thanks
B0032Z2N82|5|Awesome! Custom fit! Worth every cent!
B008R18D9O|5|Awesome 3 layers but the zippers are kind of cheap
B007MX5MYW|5|looks good
B008JHJF84|5|very nice. My daughter loves it
B000GV7CR2|5|Allows me to use a larger brake disk when using sticky street tires.
B00E3BRZFK|2|It did not work well, unable to pick some stations, ended up using a longer antenna
B009PVETAM|5|Fits, replaced my broken one just fine, now i have a spare too. Can't complain!
B00068GEJM|5|great
B004OFNJZ0|5|These look so nice in my car! They do their job well and block out a lot of sun.
B00LIR7L10|5|Good stuff came as described and works great
B001DKT0DO|5|Excellent Poduct
B00EUUNJRM|3|Much smaller than expected.
B00EAOIRBQ|5|Good quality, a lot better than the local autoparts, reduced the smell.
B007QV785Q|1|Bendy metal. Tip broke off.
B00MTHPAN4|5|They only come on when the bike is in motion, so that is excellent. The skull part, which is plastic, did not tighten correctly and probably would have fallen off in use. Noticing this I super glued the blue plastic heads to the body of the unit which does not interfere with use or changing of the batteries. So far, so good, they have not fallen off. I recommend super gluing these upon arrival and letting them dry for at least 24 hrs before installation.
B00KW1ZCUK|4|It was right for my application, & wasn't to hard to install. I would buy again.
B00AYH6BSO|3|Meets my expections.
B0031I2SNK|5|Fit perfectly on the car. Delivery was fast. It came on expected day even though it was July 4th
B00FPL0NH4|5|Works great and was the best price I could find. Nice to be able to put window down.
B00H7W39DY|4|This is a very nice frame.  It is good quality and getting the screw covers included was a great bonus.  My only complaint is about the packaging of my shipment.  It was in a slightly padded envelope and it got a little bent.  But nothing major. Overall it was a good purchase and unlike the VW Turbo frame I bought it actually fits a standard license plate.
B005N6XPM6|4|Fits my mom perfectly.
B00IEYEANM|5|ty
B00W4B4WS4|1|I'm not satisfied with the poor quality of the button that hold's the key into the fob. The button does not hold the key securely in the fob I've already lost one fob. The key is easily pulled by hand out of the fob even when the button is in the locked position. Is there any compensation to me for my loss?
B00802FFBO|3|It's fair
B001P2H4CE|5|wrong size, smooth return
B00K2OV0MG|5|Worked perfectly on my 2002 Porsche 996
B0087NAWYQ|5|Well made, adaptive installation went fine on my Nolan 104, sound in the helmet good, easy/quick link with iPhone 5, microphone boom could be a bit longer for the Nolan 104,seems thus far to be ok in the weather, for the money a good value !
B00BITLOUW|4|It works it ain't the cats meow but it works fits good and looks mice
B0083SL82A|3|These mirrors are alright,  they are much harder to see out of than the OEM triumph bar end mirrors these copy.  Additionally they are not made to fit standard 7/8&#34; bars, I had to add material to make them mount and hold.  Yes, the kit does come with all the necessary pieces to mount the mirrors on the ends of the bars including inserts and several other extra pieces. However, I wanted them to mount directly to the bar, not some adapter inserted into the end of the bar.  When the mirrors are mounted directly to the bar there is far less vibration and they are far easier to stabilize,  i just wish the fit correctly.
B00CFCHSZG|2|Too small. Doesn't fit 2003 Altima.
B00BU616K6|5|Very happy with the Visor. Made my race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway more comfortable by not having to wear sunglasses inside my helmet!
B00QITJTN6|1|Too large for my visor, didn't use it and too expensive to return.
B0018EXID8|4|This bag holds plenty of clothes for one person for a 3 or 4 day trip, or 2 people for a weekend.  It looks good and is the perfect size for me.  The exterior pockets are nice to keep cell phone, sunblock, etc. easily accessible.  Also has a mesh divider inside to keep dirty clothes.  We did hit some rain, and I can't say I like the rain cover that much.  I can't attest to how well it keeps things dry because we didn't hit a real downpour and it only rained for a short while.  But I did deploy it.  It more than covers the bag but I couldn't get it cinched down real well without using a bungee. I was afraid it would tear apart because of the wind.  In the future I will just bring a plastic bag to bungee over it.  I may not have needed it but I also used 2 bungees to secure the bag to the bike.  I just felt better doing that.  I did not use the roll bag part of it as I had plenty of space w/out it.  It is nice to have, though, if needed.  My brother liked it so much he plans to buy one.
B00IA9TP72|5|I love these shoes!
B000NW5SKW|2|Not nearly as think or durable as the original that came with my buffer.
B00ZWRFQ1E|5|I'm using these LED bulbs in landscape lighting fixtures.  Much better than the previous LEDs I had been using.  Brighter and warmer.  Compatible with both my Moonray and Paradise fixtures.  Beats incandescent hands down.
B0024NSMLA|5|Perfect for car
B0096QB1GQ|5|Fast shipment, great quality. A++++++++
B007XHS7BC|5|New. Perfect fit. Works fine.
B00K39T3RY|2|Fogs on the inside after 3 weeks
B0040M30U6|5|Good product as advertised!
B00C2TETI6|1|Received this BBQ and the control knob was broken. We bought it for a trip and it surely let us down. Better yet, I can't return it!! I would not buy this product. Amazon has let me down on this purchase.
B0047DGTIS|5|Although we have two newer cars and a newer truck, I cannot part with my 1999 Grand Marquis. When the rear air suspension quit I was sad at the thought of getting rid of the old Merc. The cost to repair/replace the air suspension and the work involved was more than I could justify. This product solved the problem for a very reasonable price. It does not ride quite as well as it used to but it still rides well and I am happy to keep the car.
B002ZBWKAU|5|This works great!  Saved me on a long road trip across the country.  I had slow leaks in two of my tires because of warped rims.  I couldn't afford to replace them before the trip so I got this.  It's super easy to use and saved me from constantly needing quarters to use the air compressors at gas stations.  I highly recommend it!
B007KPSUYG|5|Very detailed installation instructions.
B0068G1GXU|5|Needed a replacement clamp for a leo vince x3 muffler that comes with a stupid carbon fiber clamp. Was able to bolt it up nice and securely to my ktm 640. The hanger is thick enough to mount the muffler solidly, but its still thin enough if you need to bend the mounting tabs some.
B00FOSSQJU|5|always the same great product.
B007D7QOH6|5|👍
B009IK94JQ|4|These make life easier when you have to have several separate keys and one common swipe tag holder. I just press and drop off key I am not using and add the key I will be using.
B00144B2LW|5|Brought it back to Australia to clean stainless on the deck that I thought I had to replace.  This stuff is really amazing.
B000C16XL2|5|Works great.  Not too difficult to install as long as you remove all of the proper tabs and screws on the interior door.
B0014E3MSS|2|This did not fit the regulator that came on my rv. I had to go to a plumbing shop to get 2 different brass fittings to make these pigtails work. i would have sent them back but would have been more of a hassel.
B00S1E1C54|5|good fit and look the same as mazda filter
B001N72FES|5|easy install good quality
B00ME86YDS|1|Stopped working after only 3 days on the motorcycle.  Multi-metered all connections and the ports somehow were dead.  I hooked up another company's adapter to the battery and it has been working great for over a month and 7,000+ miles.
B00HEEXJ9O|5|Worked perfectly on 02 rsx base. There are insufficient instructions but can google howto
B00AOO8KSG|1|The torklift T3301 did not fit my 2004 Tundra double cab (4 full doors) but the torklift T3302 did. Installation of the T3302 was simple. Both sides were done in less than an hour.
B00IEF04CW|5|Bright colors and sticks good.
B004EIDD2Q|2|Not Worth it.  Jumped my riding mower, but not my car
B00H9S71LW|5|Great tool for monitoring and getting ODB codes. Works fast and accurate. It's quite sophisticated for the price.
B00DMWJAN6|3|These boots are well made, but do run about half a size larger than advertised. It'll take some miles to break them in enough for smooth shifts, as the top of the boots are very rigid. This is a small trade off in exchange for the solid ankle support. The soles have very good grip. No spare sliders are included and they are plastic rather than aluminum, but for $90 these will do a fine job.
B004A39H1G|5|good
B00BBXFJTC|5|Fit perfect and they look so good.
B00480J4I2|5|This is exact replacement for my car
B00TEJR1PK|5|Awesome !!
B0084DVOZU|5|Looks very nice I'm 52years old female and had no problem installing it by myself thank you happy customer
B006WQSWQA|4|Only in truck for two weeks so far so good.
B000FFQVVC|5|Put these on my 11 frontier.  Fit great and no noise.
B009VI5TDU|5|As it turned out, I didn't need to use the kit yet so I can't rate it, but I have it for when I do need it.
B005CLKKRU|4|excellent
B00FC22PFE|3|Great illumination but needs relays to work properly since car's wire harness can't handle the power.
B00OU67Z80|5|brightest light I've ever used...Great!
B004CGOGFS|5|I finally decided to splurge and buy one of these pullers. It is much better than the ones I usually rented. The tie-strap keeps the puller in place when you apply pulling force and that is a good safety feature. Applying a rust penetrant first around the hub and drums mating diameter is advisable. I'd also advise that you may need to apply heat with an oxy-acetylene torch though, as your drums may have been pressed on at the factory and pulling force alone may only bend your drum's steel backing plate and the drums still won't come off. I usually torque the puller's jack-screw only enough to start to deform/oil-can the backing plate. Then, while the drum is under the tension of the puller, I use my torch with an average sized tip to heat a cherry-sized dot just outside of the hub diameter, adjacent to the axle's flange face, then I do the same across from it on the other side of the hub. The drums usually pop free all of a sudden. You have to be careful and not heat too much, or torque the screw too much too. If the drum won't come off on the first try, squirt some more penetrant on it and let everything cool down. Then, try again. It usually works then.
B00LDNGHN2|5|Everything installed perfectly and they look great!!
B003AVSEDG|4|Looks great on my 93 jeep wrangler yj. Would definitely recommend for a 1&#34; extra clearance. I didn't end up using the front grille bumpers and the front most bolt could be a little shorter. Excellent product though.
B00TP0GBNG|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.
B00BR4K0CG|5|works great
B002T5TH5I|2|No change in sound of engine. No change in performance. Mileage down by .5 mpg.  I had no issues to begin with and thought it might provide some benefit based on reviews here. Maybe it's doing something amazing in the engine, but there's no observable evidence of it whatsoever.
B00FKZ1KDG|2|I ordered this jacket because it is a nice compliment to my yellow Triumph Speed Triple.  Unfortunately Joe Rocket sizes run quite small.  I had to return it.  My previous riding jacket is a medium.  I think I got it at Wilsons close to twenty years ago, and it's worn out.  I've, unfortunately, grown in more directions than up, so I thought I'd go up a size since the medium almost fits.  This jacket came in smaller than my old MEDIUM leather jacket.  Also, the protection in the elbows and shoulders is present, but it's soft and lumpy.  It was kind of like felt.  It's a nice looking jacket, but the large won't fit you if you're a size 46, like I am.
B00EC2CG9U|3|Just as described. But maybe a little too weak to hold our bikes on the bike rack.
B00RCA4O8U|4|For anyone who is on the go or has children this organize is a MUST! It's true to color and conveniently allows you to use one or both compartments. Breaks down flat to allow for storage when not in use.
B001T7JWN4|5|Meets or exceeds expectations!
B0010E18VA|5|ceramic is awesome, minimum dust. rims stay cleaner
B005DM0OC4|5|15 min install and much cleaner coolant after 4k miles. Hopefully my 6.0l PSD goes another 160k. It also looks good under the hood. Its cheap insurance even if it buys me only 10% longer engine life.
B00VB2OH2I|5|Much higher quality than I expected and fit like a glove. Didn't budge during a storm with high winds. Great product!
B00RM7Y0F0|1|Ordered these side window visors for my new 2015 Buick Encore. Received package, opened carefully.  Shipping timely, packaging flimsy and careless.  Unpacked entire box, searched for installation instructions - nothing, nada, zip, not even a photo.  No web address or phone number so I searched for company name.  Finally figured out I was supposed to watch a video.  Searched through entire list several times. Nothing for an Encore.  Tried calling, but it was Saturday so I got a recording to call back Monday.  Finally found an email address and wrote in frustration.  Later in the afternoon got a reply with a link to a video.  Video was for a 2009-2012 Prius, which they said was &#34;similar&#34;.  Watched video three times and got sort of an idea.  After 30-40 minutes, I finally got TWO of the EIGHT clips fastened and the visors taped in place.  They seem firm - will try on the highway tomorrow with fingers crossed, hoping they don't fly off.  Of course now there are six holes in the visors where the uninstalled clips should be.  I suppose I'll have to find a way to plug them so rain doesn't spray through into the car interior.  No follow-up call or email today to see if the video for Prius installation worked.  Buyer beware!
B00PLCVMZY|4|This thing is great. It's easy to attach almost anywhere. I fold it back and use extra rings to make it smaller for my cell phone. You can still use the touch screen through the plastic and can hear the speakers just fine. Great for the kiddos.<br /><br />update: lowered the rating to 4 stars, should be 3.5.  The loops suck.  They stretch out or break off.  I'm cutting the rest off and sewing on velcro loops.
B00002N9G3|5|I already had two of these to keep cargo from moving around in the back of my pick up, but I bought this one to hang my dry cleaning on. I have this installed on the top part of my truck topper, and it works great to hand my uniforms on when traveling.
B001F0O4O2|5|Good product. Fits perfectly, the silicone seal works well and I prefer the hex wrench to the flat head screwdriver required by the OEM part (which is easy to strip).
B003AVO41M|5|Made my car go from loud and annoying to drive to practically &#34;new car&#34; quiet. 2007 Focus zx3. I'll update this review if anything changes but for now everything is perfect.<br /><br />Also: I don't know if this is relevant or important, but I didn't bend the leg down around the motor mount strut, but rather just inserted it through the slot.
B002EOZFQ4|5|Easy install. Works great.
B000C9L7VA|5|Sight unseen, and fits perfectly. (OEM part) Checked vin#, year, and model on several websites to insure ordering the right part. Ordered this part for my friend and it arrived as promised. Received absolutely no feedback from friend on fit and finish, so I know it fits and works with no problems.<br />btw: car is up and running.
B003YLMQHC|5|Perfect for my 2003 Suburban. Would have liked if the new wires were all different colors rather then black and white. Easy installation
B000C2WDIS|5|Before ordering did checks on different websites using the vin# and production date of the vehicle which insures a perfect fit. Ordered this and a lower hose for the vehicle. As this was ordered for a friend in another state, I received no feedback from happy friend which assured me that it fit.
B001KRY67A|4|Fit my 2006 f250 6.0 diesel . Fast delivery and works great. Was missing backplate so I was worried about moisture getting into it but it's under the hood and 1/3 the price of Napa so I'll just deal with it when happens.
B0010DXYHW|4|Good price, good product. Takes a little doing to get it lined up just right.
B00SCXCQV8|5|Great item. Highly recommend
B004GBJAOG|5|Quality Product!
B000BQRG00|5|Worth it if you own a rig or RV.
B00JKEBJK2|2|Returned, Wasn't for me!
B000FPYFJW|5|The hood release cable listed did the trick. Retrofitted it to an older vehicle by a different auto maker a couple weeks ago and it is still doing great. Customer service was great with questions about the specifications and shipping was quick too.
B000C9FPM2|5|easy to install and works great. not much to say about a brake cylinder
B000HBM86Q|5|Came in handy when lapping my valves
B00IV50JTS|5|Works great
B0073XMXMK|5|Looks great and good reception, even in a semi-rural area.
B003AS99DI|3|Erupted easy
B0093C7RF2|5|2004 Yukon.  Items fit as expected, no issues or warping after a couple thousand miles.
B001QK1X5O|3|Nice lock received it very fast we thought it would be keyed like the other lock we received and only used one key.  It will be used somewhere else
B00KTIUI9Q|5|Perfect!! Highly recommend this remote :)  so easy to program
B00GSAUHB8|5|They work great!
B00JO9PBG6|5|Pins work perfectly!
B00HVHG0VI|5|Thanks!
B000C55WC4|4|Tie rod end is good but they didn't come with the 90 degree zerk fittings as advertised.
B010MRDD5O|1|The brackets were slightly too large - and I could not get them tight enough to hold my light bar tightly in place.  I went with another mounting option.
B000BOKNGQ|5|Love the smell
B00C5RBRA8|5|Awesome product, however, the connecting brackets don't allow it to fit in my RV bumper.  Maybe my bumper is too small. either way, it serve's its purpose, cleans out easily and still packs up nicely.
B004HDPWO0|1|no the product had a factory defect I have retuned it to them. they have not yet been paid back not cost
B004AGCC1K|5|update 8/17/2015:  In my original posting i complained it did not fit my 2007 Monte Carlo.  It does in fact fit.  However, be sure you know which sensor you need.  This one is for the downstream location past the catalytic converter.  I originally intended to use it for the upstream location which is a different fitting on the end.<br /><br />This does not fit the 2007 Monte Carlo v6 flex fuel.  You need the upstream fitting on the sensor since it is above the catalytic converter at the manifold behind the engine.  Be sure to verify the fitting before you buy!  I waited to long to swap it out and now cannot return.  be sure to use right away in case you must return.  I am outside of return window now and stuck with a part i can't use.
B00WRX8ELK|5|Love it
B00FZKVRLG|5|Very bright. Easy to install. Love it.
B000C59XKG|5|No complaints. These work as advertised. The Moog 'problem solver' line of parts is good stuff.
B000CLYVWU|5|This is an old-fashioned bargain! Great price, quality, fit and function. I'm sure it looks just as nice as the original mirror looked sitting on the dealer's lot when the car was new. I wholeheartedly recommend this product. You just can't go wrong! This replaced the mirror on a 2001 Saturn SC1.
B00CP2U8DA|5|It works as described, what else it their to say?
B00J711TQC|5|Looks exactly as it does in the picture.  I love it!
B00603DSGO|2|Crooked.
B00AWAM9GG|5|Quick shipment. As described.
B005C1Y4Z4|5|These are easy to install and make a huge difference.
B00JLVWDO0|5|I order this with standard shipping and got it the next day!. Easy to install all the mount and everything is identical to the OEM radiator. Perfect replacement for my stock one. My cars runs great now. No more leaks and no more over heating. Thank you!
B00EECLMWK|4|VERY reasonably priced.... Maybe a little more blue than I am used to but they work great...
B00JQMX87K|5|Awesome
B007JXJMB4|5|work great on my  DODGE  SPRINTER 3500 2004
B004MNE200|5|So far I like it.  Don't always park in center of mat and the first bump gives you a jolt before you roll to the bigger bump for that final stop.
B00AYXM4DY|5|First of all......FOLLOW THE DIRCTIONS!!!. Don't complain that it doesn't work on your headlights after just wiping it on there. Wiping is the last step. See the photos of my friends headlights after I did them. It DOES work. Some other guy left a bad review saying that he wiped his headlights and made it look worse I will say it again....Dont complain if you can't read simple directions.Great stuff.  Doesn't restore headlights 100 percent (at least with one use)  but damn close. Just follow the directions and don't rush. It's easy to use, doesn't take long and will save you a lot of $ compared to buying new headlights.
B00RW3ERD4|5|worked great on my duc
B0006IX7WY|5|Perfect for keeping my milk from falling out the door after our commute to our destination!!
B0068EROZ6|5|A+++
B00KTIZ2C4|5|I bought these in case I ever needed to get in my car and was impressed how easy the programming was and works like a champ. I dont really need them to open my car a mile away like some will complain, I will ask those who are thinking of buying these do you really need to be 50 or 75 ft away from your car to open it? How far away are you when you pull the latch? Buy without fear!
B000NCS7GE|5|Got the item, Thanks
B005JU5ZYC|1|Will not fit my Beetle. Even after trimming the mounting to be able to slide into the tip of the arm, it was then too short to snap in. If you're buying for a VW or Audi, you better be sure this is what  you need.
B0049Z2WMQ|5|Very good
B00AOKX1PW|5|Actually gave me some much needed gains in mpg! The finish is great on my pickup. Wish it had a little bit deeper tone, but then again I'm in an ecoboost f150. Easy install, just watched a YouTube video.
B000E26H60|4|Looks like a little pan
B00GWFPP8O|4|Got mine used but does the job
B003021D0Q|5|Great replacement at a reasonable price.
B00XAX4B9A|5|Fantastic. Great product and fast service.
B007TMV1W8|5|Very good
B0083P3Z6A|3|The header included with this exhaust will NOT fit B series engines, only D.  Amazon says it will fit 99-00 Civic Si's but that is inaccurate.<br />From the test pipe back it is fine though.  I ended up not returning the product because I got to the header last and just ordered a 1 piece 4-2-1 off ebay.  Also, just a tip, if you have any suspension adjustment to drop your car I would suggest a 4-2-1 instead of a 4-1 header since the design of the 4-1 headers have 2 pipes sitting far lower and forward in your car and they can easily get crushed/scratched when pulling in and out of steep grade parking lots.
B00OYM73VE|4|Nice
B00NPQV06O|3|Nice light, very bright, and constructed very well. The only reason I give it 3 stars is the heat. It gets so hot you can touch it over the course of about 10 minutes.
B001341K92|5|LOVE IT
B000CP8EAG|5|Only issue I had with this is after having this on the truck for three years, the material attached to the top of the cover started pulling out of the leading edge.  I repaired it and added some gorilla glue to secure it back in place.  Awesome.  I will be buying another.  Just hope they ship to Hawaii.
B00O8FWCPY|4|Part works great
B0027K41QU|5|nice little kit...haven't tried the vacuum pump yet, but so far, so good.
B00Z8M9USI|5|Work well save $40.00
B000BQSL5E|5|These work fantastic. I wish people would stop stealing them on me!
B000C2UJY8|5|I replaced the belt in anticipation of a 3000 mile road trip, and I'm glad I did. Took about 1.5 hours to replace. Fits my 2003 Nissan 350z and seems to be working just fine. I'll update my review if quality appears to be a problem, but as of right now I'm pretty happy with this product. I'm glad to have done this work myself mostly because saved a bunch of $$.
B001DR9VJK|3|Some of the studs that are pressed into the the shoes came loose during installation making the installation process longer and more cumbersome. Worked otherwise as advertised.
B0000AY1W7|5|WORKS WELL ON MY DODGE RAM
B00JINPJD8|3|Tried the grit guard while washing the car in the swiping method described.. Does not really seem to remove much grit and it is quite hard to swipe a heavy wet mitt at the bottom of a bucket full of water..
B000P4S8HI|5|It's a great part and it fixed my problem.
B0040CTTH4|5|just what I needed!
B007VV0HOA|5|Excellent product!
B0009IQXFO|5|Excellent soap, left my car looking almost brand new and really clean.
B0007UAXK0|5|This is great made seats from 72' look new
B00B6X7PGM|5|Mower started on first pull!!
B000HRX1JS|5|Great bag, took on a 9 day motorcycle trip. Used the rain cover with no water penetration. The bag has a metal frame and does not collapse when tying down.
B003D3PP6K|5|It's compact yet holds quite a bit. Glad I purchased it.
B00T74VX24|5|PERFECT!!!!
B00DWVNJZC|5|ok
B001653JHY|4|Good fit.
B00EV0KKDC|2|Not good. Red paint came off in a few months.
B002FV8N9W|5|good quality,  good service
B0011FLODA|5|works great with my generator and RV
B0055PD1H4|5|Works great on my Tacoma. Definitely worth purchasing
B000BUU5WW|5|Had no clue this existed, works great.
B00WNMKBEI|5|just what they wanted it was great thanks again
B008G594T4|5|The best thing since slice bread
B0002KR88A|5|Good Product
B00BUFWL88|5|good
B00075XCCG|5|The quality is evident right as you take it out of the box.  This looks and feels well built.  After using it, I know for sure it is a great purchase.<br />Installation was straightforward and simple.
B009DJTBRW|5|Great Price, My turn signals work again.
B0006Z9YOC|5|Great product and service.
B00JPSAROM|5|All went well
B004VR0QP2|5|Much heavier duty and better quality than the berg bars they replaced. Found that although Amazon listed them as an exact fit, they are actually for the crew cab not the double can truck. A little long, but fit easy and look good.<br />Lund site was hard to use to verify the fit. They actually list this model number as a. Exact fit. However, in reading the details they liet two model numbers, so read details carefully.
B004A20OJ6|3|Steering wheel was ok but had to drill the center out bigger
B00QUHEUJO|5|Much better concept than others on the market. Plus they are hand made by an American!
B0000CBILL|5|Just what it is, I use it in my rebuild 1982 Dodge D50. Gives me some peace of mind...
B0009JKI8G|5|Fit like a charm! this fit my 2011 Hyundai Tucson perfectly. it was easy to get on and wipes clean and clear.
B00KLKWX6I|4|Its’ a very good quality product but  they need to improve  on their order processing time.
B00KIBH2Y8|5|Awesome
B00NM8SYWS|5|excellent does the job at a great price.
B000ZN3GNK|5|Good parts, good quality, and doing what I need them to do. Price was as good as anywhere.
B009H9BCIO|5|Works, good quality, no issues really. It's just a rubber boot.
B000C7QKJG|3|Good and light, but the pegs were plastic and had broken in transit. So far working as expected.
B001DKTG0G|5|Noticed a big change in smoothness and lack of resistance in my 330Ci gearbox as soon as i changed it. Old fluid may have been 125k old....so....not too surprising, but i'm happy with my purchase.
B00T5DPJBI|5|Honestly , they fit beyond great , my car is sitting perfect now , and haven't had no problems at all
B0002MBKUU|4|Works beautifully and it made well.
B00U4IHSZI|5|Thx
B000UUMM6K|5|Just what I expected
B00YF4GT98|4|arrived as a new and fully functioning part. Satisfied
B0098TG7BK|4|The color of tank pad isnt as dark as i pic. In my case that worked out great. Also looks like it would have white outlines but it doesnt.  Good quality
B004YA4XPK|5|Awesome!
B000BZ6NZU|5|little pricy but they work great
B003VLBPJA|3|Net is good shipping was very slow
B007KPSR9O|5|Works great, I trailered a V11 LeMans back from Atlanta (475 miles) in a covered M/C trailer. Did a preliminary check on motorcycle after a few miles to be sure all was tied down...then did not worry about bike for the remaining drive home. Also handy in the garage for holding bike upright.
B000Z37YAG|5|GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
B001G7NR9W|5|fit great just like oem
B00RPGY1UM|5|GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
B00ONGVIEY|5|Working 100%
B004VESKEY|5|Great piece. Great seller.
B00A6G5R4W|5|delivered promptly, and performs exactly as stated.  I put one on my Generator, one on my Honda Gold Wing.  They both appear to be happy.  I was worried if these two-for deals would have all the connections.  No worries, they did.  Now it is only necessary to pull the Gold Wing in the garage and plug it in.  If we've been on a ride, the light turns green almost immediately.
B009H9BGKI|5|Its work very good
B001DCH30E|5|Perfect fit for 2006 CTS-V.  Why can's Cadillac use better parts in the first place so that I don't have to repair this?<br /><br />Oh GM....
B00X48QPDQ|4|Perfect, thank you
B00KTIC2ZE|5|Works fantastic and installation was less than 10 seconds.  So happy and it stands out. Now if it could come in purple. Thank You.  Totally save me money as I had wasted money on so called replacements that did not work with my vehicle.
B006NZTZLQ|5|I purchased this scanner for my Pontiac Grand Prix I absolutely love it. I was able to look up the codes that my car was giving me and doing research on what the issue was and how to fix it without having to take it to a shop and paying a diagnostic fee. It stayed plugged into my car at all times due to the issues my car had. It never drained the battery and always connected without any issues to my phone. I have since moved away from that car but I always have this scanner with me, I have used it to find out what the codes are for many of my friends also. I use the OBDLink app on an andriod phone.
B0049ETQI0|5|Perfect thanks
B000GZLHF6|5|Great experience shipped fast
B00L4NHW7Q|5|no smell - looked at another recommendation & it said it fits a toyota camry but it's really too small
B00H9CPLBU|5|Gift for my daughter, she loved it!
B009E9J2TS|5|Love it!
B00PZLYLOK|3|It works very well but i did not really want the siren part of it i just wanted the emergency horn and the pa system.<br />Do you have one with just the Emergency horn and PA system with out the Siren? Let me know and i will purchase it from you.
B00K2QM4NI|5|Looks Great & very sturdy.
B00NDN4ZE8|5|Came as advertised. I started using them right away, and the result was great.  No lint residue, that was a big plus in my book.  Also they arrived on time and well package.
B008AYL4F8|1|Very unhappy had these lights for a little over 6 mouths and one of the tail light lens fell off and I lost it on the freeway some were. Rxmotor don't want to help fix the problem
B00823FSRC|5|Tires stink for a few days, other than that, it works well for maunevering my kayak
B001AVU102|5|Just needed a cheap set of sprockets & chain for my 2008 TTR 125 LE and this fit the bill.  Sprocket appears to be very well made and seems to be holding up well.
B003TNHEO0|5|husband likes it  satisfied with it.
B000BUQODG|5|Works as it should!  Love having the vents open in the rain!
B00EPYE3R8|5|Love it!
B001KQE9Q4|5|Fits 2006 Tacoma easily
B009Z7O3SY|5|Fast shipping! Had doubts about quality from the reviews but was more than happy with what I got. Lowes and Home Depot refused to cut the key, had to find an actual Locksmith to get it done. Cost me a couple of dollars to cut the key and it works great! Will likely get a couple more.
B000ARPVOI|5|I use it in all combustion engins from my lawn mower to my 5.9 cummins
B000VWK4UI|4|Nice top for the money. Needs support over driver and passenger seat during heavy rain on my yj.
B001B0VCBE|3|ok
B004UBCKYY|5|i have these tweezers on my key chains and like them so well i ordered another two for my other key chains and for gifts for woodworking friends. can't beat them!
B000N321KG|5|Works GREAT!
B00192JFBI|5|Works great
B006HT9JSM|5|Love it
B004THIACA|5|Works great. Heavy duty.
B00F3PZ1LA|5|Quality construction.
B0002BGELQ|5|great item fast shipper.
B0056IC4QE|5|Fit perfect and cheaper than dealer
B002LTEU68|5|Bought this based on other comments.  Used to clean and polish my 45 yr old eating utensils.  Did a great job.  Needed to get polishing disc  which made a Hugh difference.
B005N53AM2|5|Love the flexibility but it was a bit of a wrestle to get on.
B00ON24SUE|5|Awesome, thanks
B0039LB8PI|5|Works great!
B008VOMIIE|5|I purchased it as a gift, and the lady loved it. It is adorable and the transaction was great.
B0012BL8LG|5|Beast!!!  Perfect for all 12V applications.
B00JXYGF3U|4|Worked out great had to go to the shop to evacuate freon then after go fill it up blowing a cool 35 degrees
B00C7PX19I|4|They fit perfectly,but had to sand down the corners slightly to keep Windows from auto down when touching ventshade. Love them,
B00B19SF9W|5|fit perfectly
B0002U1TX0|5|After using the other steps in the Ultimate Wax System and using the clay bar system, I used this to protect and seal all of my work Now my car reflects sunlight like a mirror.
B00L4TF32G|5|This is an excellent product. Better than more popular brands.
B00OC8MWG6|5|Love this!! Fits my plate perfectly!
B00GHT9G6W|5|This spare tire hoist/holder fit perfectly on my 2003 GMC Envoy.It was just what I needed to get the spare tire out of the back of my suv.I would order again from Dorman.
B00LWS28SQ|5|As described.  Quick arrival.  Reasonable price.
B0068FYF6Q|5|A lot of times when you buy something for cheap, you get what you paid for. This is not the case with this helmet. Everything about it seems solid and high quality.<br />Very fast shipping. I ordered this Monday in the PM, it was shipped the same day and delivered on Wednesday!<br /><br />Originally I bought a large because the sizing chart said I was at the top range of that size. I heard people say that if you are between sizes, it's better to buy a smaller one since a helmet should have a snug fit. Size large barely fit on my head and was uncomfortably tight. I returned and had my money refunded fairly promptly. It still takes a little bit of effort to put XL on but once on, the fit is pretty good. So I would say the sizing runs small.
B00DZ35HES|5|Awesome
B00LAJTEFW|5|These fit my Ford E450 rims perfectly. Look great and seem very durable.
B00GJKXW8M|5|It works great and my friend are jealous,
B00N2BRPFW|1|the cell is something very wrong hubcaps what are you also refunded me and he was fairly decent about it
B0066R8NZA|5|perfect
B00HUBF47G|5|faster than expected/advertised delivery. Factory part. Top mount post (new style starter) spins engine MUCH faster than end mount post. Old starter had broken magnets inside and would drag or turn the engine slowly when cranked.
B002O8S5SU|5|love the sticker but wish you made some that don't say Fearless Friend but are just plain with the dog.
B009DJMP6Q|5|perfit fit, perfect price
B004CG8HGM|5|Buying this part from Amazon saved me $120. I thought it must be a junky knock off but this was the exact part that I had on my bike originally.
B000KZ23SM|5|Received quickly and works great
B00GD2SGJQ|5|Worked like oe
B002UX1T78|5|High quality and very bright.  Recommend
B00KSO95CM|3|Thought it was more like a carpet :(<br />It's pure rubber. All in all it serves its purpose.
B00ZFI7D5C|5|Perfect fit, easy install
B003CKFKI2|5|these mount on a 7/8 inch handle bar perfectly , look sharp , best mount ever .
B00NXRY5EY|3|I had a really hard time getting the end cap to stay attached after I mounted these on my 2006 Honda Civic
B003UW1IQU|5|I love Chemical Guys and this polisher has made me a fair amount of money detailing.
B00P2D3VZG|5|Used on the Subaru for license plate... perfect!
B0035XGPNA|5|great
B00AWNWHJC|5|Very well built thanks !
B00SSC4BPC|5|Great
B00J4PGTHA|3|These are nice, but sadly did not fit my 2009 Lancer GTS's 18&#34; rims. Amazon's utility says it fits my car, but my stock rotors are much bigger. When I installed one, it hit somewhere in the middle of my brake pads I was installing. I'm going to have to return them.
B00BTGSGFK|5|These are really, really awesome. They are great for both applying waxes and sealants to paint and for sealing and polishing wheels.
B00GHT79W0|5|Worked great.
B00RSG1LXY|5|I gave this item to my Granddaughter for her birthday, and she loves it she takes it where with her.
B001LHVOVK|5|Very easy to use and understand.  I use this to help understand an issue I have with my emissions sensor.  After I run a tank of gas with cleaner agent in it,  it fixes the problem for a few xxxx miles.  I rest the engine light after with this.  Many older cars (100K miles or more) have this problem I was told and have reviewed online.  Cleaning the sensor this way it the best and least costly (a few bucks every 2-3000 miles).
B00H4GCDTO|5|ty
B00KZJQ2L2|4|This works for a truck. I always get confused on which way to fold them.
B004OT4VSK|5|The best floor mats out there because they are carpet, molded, water proof and protect your OEM carpet.
B003NAPO46|5|The mat is a perfect fit for my 2015 Ford Flex.  A small investment to protect the carpeting in back from snow, etc.  I also like that it keeps stuff from sliding around.  Groceries stay put!
B00I9IBKZO|5|Worked great on my '00 TC88B.
B002SJBXPC|5|Great price. Same as the JKS but half the price. Worked great when installing ling travel shocks on my ZJ.
B00RVETUWC|5|As described . Fast delivery . Looks well built. Haven't installed it yet will follow up after installed
B005RF6G4M|5|Best in the market
B000NCOKZQ|5|Works great
B00XBX51HU|5|just arrived today! WAY before they said it would be here which was awesome! i bought them for my trucks dome light and the pair put off Plenty of light!!! way more than satisfied!!!
B00FS93LZO|5|Fit my 2010 3500 Silverado perfectly. The SR2 20&#34; combo (driving/ spot) looks great and is very bright.
B00684TD6O|5|Works great, gets the job done and is affordable unlike at any store you go to which is $20 and up. Very happy
B0006MTRJ2|5|They work like advertised
B00LOBL436|5|Abs light was on and I think I was getting the flashing codes for 34 or 32. Whatever it was it needed up being the front passenger side speed sensor so I got an amazon, bought this bad boy, unbolted the old one and slapped this one in there. Pumped the brakes and cleared the codes and my abs light is off. Only concern, small one, is I can hear the front passenger abs kick on when I first started her up sometimes. Everything works fine but it's a quick sound of the abs on startup.
B006V7TBBA|5|Lights and wiring were easy to install and took less than an hour to finish. Lights are bright and covers road completely.
B004TDHXLS|5|Quick shipping. Fit my old 97 RAV perfectly.
B00VDQN35Y|2|it does not work properly. the ad states  led light harness and the switch says for a winch? Wires are very light for any large light.
B00CMX20H4|5|FAST SHIPMENT; ITEM AS DESCRIBED. AAA
B00INA090U|5|Great help for me as bright sunlight glaring off windows, chrome, etc causes me great pain in my eyes.  The light also cause migraine head aches.  I am very grateful to have the Easy view XT Visor.
B004TMHF8K|5|Love it
B001VZN6ZO|5|I've found on my truck it gets better mileage in the performance verses the  fueling saving setting.  Great power turns over my 35 inch mud tires with ease
B007OW6MD6|5|Fits great. I use them to replace the old one on the drain plug about every 3 oil changes
B00NE78OFE|5|Awesome price and was as described. Very fast shipping and easy to install. Overall very happy with the product
B0016J3YG6|4|Bought this for a co-worker. He hasn't complained about it.
B008CE0TN4|5|Works great!!
B00S0O02HE|5|Very easy to install.  It seems to be working perfectly.  I did cut off the switch and use another that was better suited to my application and custom switch panel.  But the rest of the kit fit the bill wonderfully!
B00AYHZ608|5|The carpet does not cover the whole floor on the driver side due the awkward shape of my car floor (toyota carolla), but I love the matts. The Blue goes perfect with the blue color of my car.
B001HBWOQE|3|Its very nice but the clip keeps falling off.
B000B8JUBQ|5|Did the job
B0002Z9M02|2|Put this on a 1999 F-250 Super duty,  Didn't really fit right.  Netting is too wide and not easily tightened even with quick release clips that I also purchased.  Looks better than the rusty tailgate so it is a slight improvement.  Sags after being on the road.  I personally did not like it but maybe others have had no issues.
B00UG0GTJA|5|This hitch is sturdy/heavy duty and is well engineered to fit and install firmly to the vehicle (a 2015 Subaru Outback), although it does require drilling a couple of 9/16&#34; holes through the undercarriage.  It's not exactly a piece of cake to install, but a reasonably competent do-it-yourselfer with the right tools should be able to complete the installation in a couple of hours.  In addition to the included instructions, there are online videos available to help visualize the procedures.
B00EZZPG00|5|As described, easy to fit, worked perfectly on my 2014 Hyundai Accent.  Popped off the painted cap from the old mirror to match the original finish too!
B000CLCPS2|5|It's made of rubber and cork so far it's good
B001CEG96C|5|Works great and air smells fresh
B009IFIQYU|3|Thin and prone to wind wobble. Fit though, as promised
B0081ST4V4|4|I got a free set from Crutch-field after ordered this set a week earlier.  BUT yes, if you have a FORD stereo that is fitting of these, you must use these to get out the stereo.  They work and without hassle.  There are online videos that show you how to remove the stereo with coat hangers, but these are cheap and less hassle - Buy them as you need them!
B000C55UXU|5|Easy shipping part fit
B00B2AF61A|5|Nicely made brake hose.
B0085IJ44C|5|Perfect fit on 04 GMC 2500HD
B009MI9JMG|5|I like this
B00361V162|5|Ordered it for my son he was able to break the element lose and change it him self.
B00BFU6IQ4|5|Product was exactly as described and shipping was super fast!
B007AEHHO6|4|A family member was returning their 2 year car lease and wanted to avoid<br /> Additional costs.<br />This part was delivered on time and installed and worked great.
B00PT18QAQ|5|This gauge measures precisely and repeatably. (I leave out accuracy only because I don't have a calibrated gauge to measure it against. That said, it is inline with other gauges I've used and I believe it is accurate.) Excellent sales followup from the company suggests customer service will be excellent. Holds the reading until released with the button, which also allows bleeding excess air from the tire. It's small enough to keep in the glove box.
B00KI5TR6K|1|These failed to fix the hyper flashing issue on my 2004 Silverado.  The problem was not resolved but made other lights malfunction by causing both turn signals to flash together when activating only one side.  I liked the idea that I didn't have to hard wire resistors however I'll use the wiring from this product and add resistors and see what happens.  This was the second brand that I bought both similar in design and neither worked.😤
B005I4PPSU|5|As picture. Yep it's thin metal, but what do you expect for the price.
B002UC6OO2|5|Couldn't get color match but a great product and great price
B0083H5V92|5|good quality,  good service
B00IJ4T7DK|5|Solid construction but NOT for a 2015 Wrangler Rubicon with a large radio. Make sure you either buy a tiny radio or decide to surrender a visor side to put your setup.
B007V2DR46|5|Really the best sun shield I have ever seen.  It's very solid and there is a noticeable difference in the interior temperature of my truck.  It's a little big and clumsy to deal with, but when your dealing with the Arizona sun there is no compromising.  A cheaper shield would not hold up.
B00BCRMA9Y|4|After I figured out how to put the seats on, it was pretty easy! I like how everything comes with it and has different colors to choose from.It'll be easy to take off if you need to clean it.
B001QUJBS0|5|Beautiful helmet, protects well, the quality is excellent ... I recommend it.
B000GZSZH4|3|easy install
B00E5OUOCQ|2|i really like how it fits and covers the whole windshield. i dont like how thin the fabric is, a lot of sunlight still shines through. and after using it 2 days the stitching around the rings is coming undone.
B00P64H6LG|2|water worked its way into the housing within a few days, now half of the leds on one of the lights won't work. Too bad, the light output was great.
B00FSG3DTG|5|Used in my travel trailer to replace original bulbs, These are the ones to buy!
B00KXE3Q3Q|5|It looks just like the picture. Perfect, good size. Thanks
B00GONFTTE|5|Very bright. Installed them on my golf cart and will order another set for my motorhome
B000B8N3GE|2|Completely stock 99 k1500 suburban.  Entirely new cooling system.  Guess what leaks?  Yep this radiator cap.  Not happy, but it's cheap so that what I get.
B00COOSF98|5|Excellent
B005RR37P6|5|I like the color
B00GQC3OJA|5|Excellent product!
B00HVI934I|5|great fit
B004RU9N7A|4|Love it! Great for use on a plane too! Prevent germs and getting sick!!
B00239V7EE|2|The glasses look good and seem to be well made. Unfortunately they do not fit over my regular glasses, to small :(
B001UJMBHK|4|Cover fit well. There was no opening for hood ornament therefore, beginning to tear from rubbing.
B002VFAOEO|4|Perfect replacement part for my Nissan. Some have said that this is either louder than original or quieter than some. I find that there is no difference in the sound and it moves air quite well. Would recommend this, and it is a great buy at half the price of auto stores.
B00RK3HI64|1|Didn't last 10 minutes broke the axel in the first mud hole I tried to avoid .. On day one of a 3 day event had to drive 45 min to get a replacement just to be able to limp around the rest of the weekend , very disappointed.
B008E7U7K4|5|great quality, great price
B00EZ9Y33W|4|Works great
B00029JZXM|5|I purchased this to retrofit in the cluster of a '66 Mustang (to replace the useless charging meter that never worked).  I essentially gutted the meter to install it into the cluster, but the result looks almost stock (and it gives me a working gauge!).
B000CC0HZ4|5|needed
B00DGB2GFW|5|In addition to my Viking I have two Yamaha Grizzly ATV's and this cover is much easier to put on my Viking than the ATV's covers. It's light but tough. I have a shed for the Viking at home but when I while I hunt I don't want my Viking filled with sleet and snow. This cover fits so well that snow and rain will all run off. This was a great purchase.
B002660FOC|5|I'm very happy with the product and the price, shipping was immediate and the service was great!
B00LXJTQ48|5|looks exactly in the picture i love it!
B001P2AVBK|5|Got exactly what i expected although though i havent used the product im very happy with it
B0002SR8AK|5|Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Also works well where you can't easily get a 4mm socket and ratchet, such as in between the adjuster screw and a radiator support.
B00D6I1H50|2|Very thin. I could not use the front mats in my Honda Odyssey because I would have had to cut them too much to make them fit. They do not stay in place.
B00JL1QC3S|5|Very nice product! I had the Husky liners in my Focus. They were nice and protected the factory carpeting - but were plastic. The last time I took the car in for a detail, the technician cleaned them with Armor All. Ugh, is all I can say about that. These, are a big step above the plastic mats. If you want a product that looks as high-end as your vehicle, this is it. I'll update the review if I ever spill liquid in them.
B00S1NT2SE|5|Couldn't find the right set of tools for my weed eater, until I found these. One of them in the set was the exact tool I needed, and was well worth the price!
B0012TZ1RU|5|Would definitely reccomend this product to a friend! I had no problem putting the pussy on the chainwax with a can of this golden elixer!
B00B788KRO|5|Quite effective in eliminating unpleasant toilet odors. Unlike some other products that actually seem to reinforce bad smells, this Blue Magic takes care of that.
B003T2FS3A|4|not perfect.
B00B1M94D0|5|Worked great,  fits my 2002 ford focus ZTS perfectly.  Although i couldnt figure out what the small round grommet/gaskets were for, there weren't any on my valve cover anywhere.
B0009IQXJ0|5|Last for weeks even with rain! Perfect shinny look.
9539751047|4|good quality
B000LQMYZC|4|good spark plugs for a great price.
B00D2I0IAE|2|Did not do what was what expected and advertised, had to send it back.
B002D6HQQA|5|fit well, no problems
B002M2X0GU|5|Good oem replacement part. Fits prefect
B000C2EEBW|5|nice heavy duty rubber gasket, oil filter gaskets fit well
B00T6JK2FY|4|easy install
B00F9RNIPI|5|Great product and we are well pleased.  Thank you.
B00M2AOJ62|5|Great item! Works great
B00NGFP5S8|5|Amazing. Works like a charm.
B00UCITKUQ|3|She said it does not fit the car like she thought it would being made for a Mustang and it is hard for her to fold up.
B009DJXZBK|1|This item is decent build quality albeit thin compared to OEM but the price is a fraction of OEM. However, this does not fit a 2006 Passat 3.6. The front of the belly pan aligns but when you try to align the sides to the securing holes, the belly pan is not wide enough.
B00EC2CG9U|5|good buy
B0001EFSUC|4|Love this tool.  Very small and handy to have around.  I put it on my key ring...  Well built.
B000N8KCPM|5|Replaced the horrible 2-piece adapter.  No leaks now.  Awesome product.  Great machining.
B0084UJIHY|4|&#34;No drilling required&#34; unless of course you want more than 2 fasteners holding the rear flaps securely. There is no mention of that until you read into the installation instructions. They also won't fit properly if you have any non-stock additions to the wheel well. I had to remove protective trim mold from the lip of the wheel well to get the flaps to fit flush. The front flaps also rub the tires in a lock-to-lock turn with stock tires and wheels. Other than that, they look great and protect my Suburban very well.
B008W3KDSQ|3|good
B000E2CVIS|5|Fit perfectly!<br /><br />Why is it so hard to find motorcyle parts at regular stores btw?!  Thankfully we found the perfect fit.  Will definitely be buying again for the next oil change!
B00KPR9Q30|5|My fifth wheel came with the Automatic Changeover Regulator By Marshall Excelsior - MEGR-250.  Not the 253.  My regulator lasted 12 years.  I wondered if this model would work so I bought one.  Packaging wasn't great, bubble wrapped envelop but the regulator arrived undamaged.  Frankly the 253 looks exactly like the 250.  It unit has four mounting holes just like the 250.  It is simple to install and you use your existing mounting bracket.<br /><br />After installation, I thought that the regulator did not work.  Bummer.  But after some more trouble shooting, low and behold, I had a bad pigtail.  This was my problem because I never thought to check on this.<br /><br />I installed a new pig tail and everything works fine.  I left the new regulator on.  So, I guess that I have a spare one now.<br /><br />So, I am pleased with the unit.  It works fine, so far as a replacement for the 250 model.  Easy to install.
B004ABHD14|5|It works...Does what it's supposed to. Over all I'm pretty indifferent to brake grease.
B00LEZU2JO|5|First class machining and product construction. Lost a part in my hurry to install (very very easy with all the tools included in the kit). Made a call to Techmount and immediately received the part. First class product and service. Since that experience was so good, I've ordered some other attachments from Techmount as well and they are just as good as this one!!
B004X5QX90|5|Fast shipping, Great price
B00B3I9I24|5|My mom almost criied she's in her later 80 s and a prourd usmc mom
B00GBBE6CA|5|Fit perfectly and it folds up into a nice storage bag for when you need it.
B003TTL0TE|4|The mitworks well
B004QEQIN4|1|Window switches do not fit well in the door panel.  When I press to lower the driver's and passenger side windows, it is like I have an automatic lower switch because the switches get stuck in the down position because the switches dont fit in the slots correctly.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this product.
B0002U1TXK|5|Worked really well on wheel fenders.
B00COYNZJ8|1|it came to me faded its very hard to tell what this even is in the windshield of my truck...
B00EDDX7L4|5|Worked well on a diesel 450 Cummins Engine.
B00NJ3M3YG|4|Looks great easy to mount
B00CBWKV9A|5|Make sure you wash it with warm water and dish soap, no chemical sprays (like Windex).
B000CFUFV2|5|These motor mounts worked great in my 1989 Jeep Comanche 4.0L. For the price I couldn't pass them up as my old mounts were shot. They probably won't last as long as some higher end mounts, but I'm okay with that for the price. Install took me a few hours as I've never done it before, but overall wasn't that difficult.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, order two of these part number, they will fit on either side of the motor.
B00B8X1YYO|5|Exact fit at portion of the cist
B005RUPM1K|1|Is not compatible with my Jetta 2009.
B000C5PY1S|4|Fits and performs as expected.
B000YQQZCW|5|I have been using it for almost 4 months and still work great. Is simple and portable.
B00OC5CIYK|5|This is a cloth wheel cover. It is easy to put on plus I can take it off and wash in laundry. It is so much easier to use than the rubber ones from car store!  Plus it has proved to be amazing in the Texas summer heat. I can hold the steering wheel without having to wait 5 minutes for a/c to cool it down.
B000A6X560|5|Correct size and easy to install. What else could I say about a clean air filter?
B002P8RAM6|5|Got it painted and looks like original
B00449UHDS|5|Excelent wires
B00LBF5AYO|5|The transfer was perfect.  We lost our Bully,Auggy, in May, but now all I have to do is glance in the rear view mirror and there he is, watching me! If you ever get Bully pups,let me know.
B00UBESWUK|1|Definitely sent me a hollow muffler no baffling what so ever horrible sounding....
B00V5YOBFA|1|Made an awful wind noise. I am currently trying to return the item and the company is giving me the run around.
B003VLBPJA|5|Great product, fast shipping!!👍
B00IKZTRLA|5|I love it! It looks great!
B002T4U3Q6|5|Awesome hitch very strong n looks stock
B007Y869JM|5|Good product.  Fast delivery. AAA
B00HHJI1JO|5|Great people
B000BQW5LK|3|Didn't fit the bottle and will wear you out with it's 4cc pump.
B00ZPWIYSS|5|LOOKS GREAT ON MY AMMO BOX
B0009IQXXG|5|Another Meguiar's product that works great.  I have tried several cheaper options but always come back to this.  The tires always shine bright and lasts for a good couple of weeks for each application.
B00DQUA2OA|5|Nice Product really liked it
B00N6DEJWS|5|Great looking sticker but won't hold its color in AZ summer
B009LLXJG6|5|Looks great on my car.
B006FKAHFM|5|This is exactly what I needed to not splice into unecessary wires in the car I was installing this into. Works exactly as stated, easy install.
B000BZEHZ8|5|Replaced the original up and down stream on my '97 GMC burb with 310,000 miles on it. Worked perfect and easy to install. Cleared my check engine light and I can feel a difference in throttle response. Also bumped the fuel milleage back up a touch but I don't drive it for that reason. Great product.
B00GBVHPNW|3|appropriate, sizing was a bit small
B0011TXCD6|5|Seem to be very good pads for the price. Paired with 121.47011 C-Tek standard rotors, break-in took about 3 miles with a little grit and grumbling in that period, afterwhich the brakes have been smooth as silk, with zero sound and zero pulsation. High-speed fade is very low, from 105 mph to 55, which is enough to badly stress anything but racing brakes. Rotors have polished very evenly and without grooving, and are smooth enough now that you can read my watch in the reflection. You truly cannot ask anymore from either of these parts for the price.
B00GRHSU5C|5|Fits great. Oversize holes for hardtop bolts make it easy to put the top on without taking this off.
B002669TU8|5|Fits perfectly. My civic now never pass middle mark on the gauge for temperature. Even in the summer right now.
B00669PWA2|3|Actually, all plastic, looks cheap. Should have bought different hitch cover.
B000C7QJC4|5|IT DID THE TRICK
B009B7KEPY|5|This shield is the best shield I have ever had.  It really blocks out the sun.  I don't have a garage so this will protect the dash from the sun.
B00UGDAVKU|2|had this on my agm for my truck and it killed the battery. i hardly drive the truck and the battery was five months old showing 12.8 when I put it on the maintainer. 3 weeks later the truck was dead but this piece of junk showed fully charged according to the lights. I bought a real charger, from Amazon, and it's worked flawlessly. Save your money, unless you're charging batteries you don't care that much about....i.e. NOT the one you have in your car.
B00P3U2NIO|5|God service,quality,I am pleased.
B00FMUYYT6|5|These were the exact same mounts that came with the truck and I purchased them for half the price the dealership would have sold them to me for.
B009WVI4YM|5|Fits perfect on my 2015 klx140
B000XRHRZQ|5|Nice looking hubcaps fit perfectly.
B006WQSGPW|2|You get what you pay for. Around 25,000 miles.
B007KPT23Y|5|Perfect fit and easy install. I did use some copper coat seal to help it stay in place but that's was just to make it easier. Exhaust is sealed.
B00U5U72VU|4|Worked good
B00CP7V4XI|5|I saw it at the Chrysler Nationals at Carlisle Pa 2015. Compared it to others at the Crossfire section and liked the way it looked. Now that its on I noticed a big improvement in wind turbulence. The clear straps really keep it from vibrations and are hardly noticeably . The price was right compared to others. I would recommend to a friend . don't know any one else with a crossfire but should work with other convertibles
B001PNMBE4|5|works well, fast shipping
B000WJEZN2|3|As noted in one or two other reviews, the header pipes were not parallel and even at the cylinder head mating surface.  They were 1/4-3/8&#34; different.  It was fairly easily rectified by judicious bending of the left side pipe.  The welds were slightly sub-par as well.  This is the fifth FMF powerbomb header pipe I have used.  In the past there have been absolutely  no issues.  I will continue to use them in the future.  I want to think that this particular unit was an anomaly.
B004WAQDMS|5|Excellent fit and OEM looks
B00ELR44AK|5|Fit perfect and works as adverted
B001447VB2|5|Amazing product!!! Used it on my BMW aluminum running boards and it took out all the oxidation and rust!! Miracle product!
B00MQKUEC6|4|Right fit, stops pretty smooth
B0041TS33C|4|Works, don't expect to run a super sound system off it
B00RUDWRR4|5|Works great on electra glide.
B00R4JTZLK|5|Looks great
B00FFL3SNK|4|Fit right over carpet no problem. Rear lip could have  been an inch deeper for 100% fit. But love that things don't move around as much . Overall very pleased .
B0041QD038|5|Really woke up my 2014 Harley Forty Eight 1200 with low end torque.
B007BKG1X2|5|This is grate quality. The chrome finish was perfect and the hing matches the original perfectly.
B000NU615U|5|no problems
B00X9F6ON0|5|Really nice and keeps items really cold!
B00T5J030Y|4|works fine, what do you expect for $20
B004SJ16QG|2|Slightest pressure it scrapes off
B002SB02MU|5|nice storage solution for the tundra..  these should be built in by toyota like they did on the older model tundras... the under seat storage was quality made, these are just plastic but still they fit like a glove and are very practical.
B00GWEU166|5|Quality product with long life at a discount price.
B00GTOJK0C|4|very good
B00C25GRI0|5|Arrived on time.....works great!
B000IZ2AVE|5|They worked great would recommend to everyone
B00HYWC9ZQ|5|Excellent
B007XE5LTG|5|This thing paid for itself the first time I took it out of the box. Easy to use.
B009DJU2IO|5|Easy install,  perfection!
B00030BFQA|5|Great product! I love that when its on it has power! No stupid microprocessor to goof things up!
B008OY2GEC|5|Perfect
B000CRI1C0|5|They work great on my Traverse and were easy to install
B001KR1BQE|5|Great product at a great price.
B00VRGM9RI|5|Better-than-expected quality and very easy to install.  The wire harness is bulky, but better too long than too short.
B004HCOE8Q|4|very good
B0076AU0YS|5|Works very well haven't had any problems.
B005ASY23I|5|Beyond my expectations great compressor.
B000CFQ2V4|1|This product negatively affected the handling of my E-350 van: square edged bump behavior was poor and caused a disconcerting slam.  I experiemented with different pressures for about a year and could not find a sweet spot.  I have removed it.
B002X6VXL4|5|Had this for almost a year and it still works good.
B008Y9KDI8|5|It fit perfectly, easy to install instructions. I would certainly buy it again.
B002UCYRZU|4|Does a good job in getting light scratches out of some plastic parts.  It worked well on my van headlights.  Did not work testing on an old pair of plactic eyeglasses.  It does state not to use it for glasses.
B0073XOMTC|5|Perfect replacement for a broken factory whip. Looks amazing and performs.
B00RIVNP1K|3|Not as nice/or large as the one I purchased from Chevrolet dealer, which oddly disappeared. It is a little short from top to bottom but fits from side to side ok.
B001QVG7MC|4|Love this stuff.  But it's NOT cheap!
B00IJW2Q9E|5|good product...
B00S0G586C|5|2006 Saturn direct fit
B004J30FAE|4|Good price. Good product.worked well. Came 2 days later than expected.
B001TI5IIQ|3|I used this product about a month ago and thought the results looked great on the day I finished. But by today I've noticed my headlamps just don't look that good. They're not cloudy again, but they have an uneven surface and they're not as clear as they were back then. It seems to work well for a little while.
B00F0RQQC4|5|awesome product fit perfectly on my kids go-cart.
B003YJ8TVQ|4|Very sturdy charger. Both round ports work fine. One of the USB ports charge my iPad, while the other one does not charge my iPad. The product description clearly states it will charge: iPad, iPod, AND iPhone. This is obviously a defect, which I will return & replace with another complete unit. Of course it's made in China. I think that country must not know what quality control is. These defects could be caught so easily & save LOTS of people time & grief. Oh well, I'm getting ready to order another one ...
B00NIYXIYK|5|Easy to change out once you have the right tools. Looks beautiful and fits perfectly.
B00JM6OEUK|5|Fit perfectly. Happy with purchase.
B00JUX1DRW|5|Nice product,good price,will buy from again,quick delivery service.
B00A5UEOLG|4|Read the instructions before trying to install.  You have to put the pieces in the console in a certain order or it will not fit.
B00JFWKLVM|1|Did not work for my door. The item should be more universal.
B005K89QK2|4|I like this organizer I use on my GL1800.  Some of the snaps come undone and you have to snap them up when you come in for a landing.
B000O0TO6M|5|Outstanding
B000OCIX7Q|2|In short bad quality , surprised
B005PD64T8|5|Very nice. Work well. Good quality.
B000YC5ID8|5|Great fittings! Arrived two days after purchase and only had standard shipping.
B0013G0DDE|2|Highly doubt what I received was acdelco.  The lug studs are not OEM size.
B0038ZN1IM|5|ty
B0034L3ITW|4|Good quality for the price.
B008BDAP44|5|Excellent product with a nice clean look and feel.  I'd buy this product again.
B000CJ048W|1|Replaced October 2014 and now they are misfiring and charcoal black. I confirmed new ones we're replaced with the old ones. No one from Denso cares to comment.
B0013OFFWK|5|Love it
B00NKA0F7U|5|I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and style of this moped cover.  I'm using it now and couldn't be more pleased!  A good buy for the price!
B00H34TMO6|5|DID NOT FIT, RETURNED. FAST REFUND.  THANK YOU
B000688VNE|4|They are just what I wanted! A must have for Jeeps!
B004X2ITB8|1|Blocks too much of the top of the license plate - In my case blocking the &#34;state&#34; lettering ... In some jurisdictions this might result in a violation for &#34;obscuring you license plate&#34;. Obscures Update: The &#34;chrome&#34; is pocked and rusted - It did not survive a northeastern winter's salted roads.
B00C2Y4P7G|5|i totally dig how this bracket mounts.  it is not that difficult, but requires some finesse as it is not in a easily accessible location. BUT IT IS DO-ABLE! i m not sure how other reviewers did it, but mine went on very easy. i even rigged my own lighting to this. warning though, local law enforcement is not a fan of this type of mounting. here are some pics, it is slightly modified, with the plate bent upwards, for the appeasement law enforcement. pic1 is lights off, behind bike at approx 5'6&#34;, pic 2 is a profile of mount and plate with light, pic 3 is eye level with my fat ass sitting on my bike with rear suspension compressed. and pic 4 is 2 car lengths behind sitting in my car illuminating bike. (to simulate being run down by LE heeheh lol)
B006FD329W|5|fit right, del. on time ,runs better than ever . will order again!!!
B00F4M37FE|5|Loud! great speaker.
B00S66SYPI|5|The wires worked as described.  Placement on the vehicle was a bit long, so I used a wire tie to secure the line to the vehicle.
B001TCWMGS|5|Fantastic addition to the garage. Just point it at the spark plug and it tells you everything you need to know. Super handy for setting the idle and max RPM's on chainsaws. What a great tool to have around.
B004C6Q50M|5|WOW, finally some thing that fit the first time with no mods, great finish, this is a great product.
B001QT4VSG|4|not bad for the price!
B007WIBVAG|2|Product was good, but did not solve my problem of the dash reflection on front windshield.
B00R5MPETS|5|Great!!  Fits perfectly, and beats expectations!!
B004E3A7FC|5|Worked perfectly in my 2004 Jeep Wrangler
