B000E1JOSE|5.0|I've seen this \\"Black and White Night\\" concert a couple of times on PBS, and it always entertained. I next bought the DVD.  Then I wanted it for my car CD player. I'm enjoying it now almost every day in the car for quite awhile now.  Not only was his voice as good or better than ever, but the band was fantastic--especially James Burton's guitar work. \\"Mean Women Blues\\" just kills me every time! I'm giving this CD 5 stars only because I can't give it 6.
B00328G4V6|4.0|I think if you are a hard-core Jimi fan, you will be happy with VON.  VON is compilation of Jimi's ideas in rough draft form along with some jamming and a combo of both.  The sound quality is excellent, but no doubt many liberties where taken during the \\"construction\\" of these tracks.  Let's face it, we have no idea where Jimi would have gone with any of this stuff.  Having said that, there's plenty of Jimi's unrefined brilliance and raw emotion flowing on this disc.  If you are a true Jimi lover, there's some good stuff for you in VON.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This Blu-Ray unlike the cinematic version will not be available on widescreen. It will be cropped to fit your TV. HDTV 16:9 only and no 2.37 widescreen anamorphic now or EVER, even on the 3D version later this year. As a huge videophile looking forward to this release more than any other this year  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with james cameron's decision here. I will NOT be purchasing this consequently. Cameron, what were you thinking?

B0031S4K5E|5.0|If you have seen and appreciate the work of  Hayao Miyazaki then you will like Ponyo.  Well not his best movie it is still a work worth seeing many times.  This set came in a nice set.  The Ponyo stuffed figure is not large but it is fine as a little stuffed animal. At that cost of a few dollars more than just the disk at a retail store it was worth it to have the better disk set and the plush toy.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|After reviewing a few opinions, I've decided to share one of own. I ABSOLUTELY love this series. I haven't been addicted to a series like this in a long time. I watched the first episode and was hooked. I can understand why men would enjoy this (nudity, language, fighting/blood), but as a female, I enjoy the storyline - love, deceit, twists & turns in the story. I don't even care about the historical aspect of it. And the men are hot to boot! At work, nobody watches this show so it's great to see on this forum that there are so many viewers equally interested and amazed at this new series. I love it and hope that Andy Whitfield has a speedy recovery. The show can't go on without him. I have read somewhere that the producers are thinking of creating a prequel in order to continue the momentum of Spartacus going. They've got to do something - I'll be going through withdrawal when the season finale hits this Friday.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Sandra Bullock was Incredible, as was the rest of the cast!  A Movie for all to Enjoy...
B0031RAOVY|4.0|No surprises in this film; it's a bona fide tear-jerker. Overall, it stays fairly true to the actual story, although there were some creative differences necessary to develop the story on film within time constraints and to allow the audience to connect with the characters. This is a film for the entire family, and especially animal lovers. Akita fanciers will especially enjoy the movie, as it recounts the real-life tale of the Japanese akita Hachiko, whose story is well known among akita folks. For purists who questioned the relocation of the setting to the U.S., put your reservations aside. While it's not based in Japan, the story stays true to the spirit of a deep and lasting bond between a dog and its owner and particularly to the loyal nature for which the akita breed is known.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I purchased this dvd for my 2 year old granddaughter. She watched it the first night and loves it so much she wants to watch it all the time. She thinks she is a princess.....

B001PPLIEG|5.0|This is by far my favorite bond yet.    Not only is Daniel Craig a delicious specimen for our female viewers' enjoyment;  We finally get to see a softer side of the otherwise jaded misogynist stereotype that decades of 007 has portrayed.     This Bond appears to genuinely LIKE women in these films and isn't afraid to show his \\"sensitive\\" side.      This is a sequel to Casino Royal, where our hero falls in love (spoiler alert) and his motives are now fueled by revenge.   Daniel Craig is a refreshing change from Pierce (yuk) with his smarmy quips and cocky attitude. This bond had a Human quality.  aaaahhh... sit back and enjoy!
B0000844I8|4.0|if you are only fimilar with this movie on tv, or have only seen the orginal release i highly recommend this dvd, it is well worth the price. the only down side i can find is that the commentaries are done by the directors and not the actors.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|As I approach my 60th birthday, I have been reflecting on how life has changed, from my point of view at least, in America.  Particularly since President Kennedy was murdered in Dallas Texas in 1963.  I saw him get murdered, and even at a young age I knew there was more that one gun firing at him.  As I grew up, I was continually amazed at how the media seemingly did not report the truth and how my country, America, seemed to start to fall from the shinning light on the hill status, into what is now a corporate Facist state of corruption and greed.  Michael Moore, and a few like him in the United States; like John Pilger in England, are trying to bring accurate information to the People to help those people who take the time to watch and learn become informed. Capitalism: A love Story, by Michael Moore is, in my considered opinion, even better than Mr. Moores' movie, SICKO, with-which he won many of American film making highest awards.  If you consider yourself to be an American, or informed, this movie is a must see.

0061854549|2.0|Not much science here.  The book devolves from some semblance of structured thought and analysis into more and more personal observations and opinions, including some \\"experiments\\" conducted by the author.  This is followed by 35 pages named \\"Reflections and Anecdotes\\", which might have been a more accurate title for the entire book, which is then followed by another 50 on - what? - the subprime mortgage crisis.  Geesh.  Maybe 1 1/2 stars.

159448385X|4.0|A thousand splendid suns goes out at a slow pace with beautiful descriptions of Mariam, an Afghan Harami, and her peaceful life in the Kolba in Herat in the 1970.  As the years go by the story of Mariam is woven into the life of another Afghan girl, Laila. They start out as enemies, but a strong friendship develops due to their common struggle and endurance in the contemporary Talibanesque Afghanistan.  Without revealing to much, the pace of the story escalates towards the end, and you have to have a stone heart not to be moved by the vivid description of beautiful, brutal and crime-ridden Afghanistan where the woman are valueless and have to live on the leashes of their husbands.    From the first page you are carried away and just have to read on and on; just another page, just another chapter. Hosseini has a wonderful pen and the story takes new turns and roads as it flows.     Go to the bookstore or log into Amazon and order this extraordinary book now!
1843106698|4.0|The reader will finish with their mind full of intriguing information about Asperger's Syndrome.  However, as an uncle to a twenty year old niece with AS, I didn't find what the information important to me.  I wanted to know how I could improve my relationship with her.  How should I talk to her?  What do I say when she is always so negative?  When she says, \\"I suck,\\" as a fact, not wanting you to try to make her feel better, then what?  When obvious truth is shrugged off, what can be said or done?  The book seems like a great tool for parents seeking to help their child, but what if the child never got help and is now twenty like my niece?  I'm searching for a book that has some advice or help in situations like these.  I believe there must be many people longing for a practical book to help improve relationships with AS family members, and if not - somebody please write it!
B0035G9ABQ|4.0|\\"Plastic Beach\\" takes the Gorillaz in a new turn, and it's not necessarily one I'd expected.  You see, while it extends the hip-hop guesting that came and went throughout \\"Demon Days\\", this time around our four heroes are overshadowed by all the cameos.  With rappers including Snoop Doog (\\"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach\\") and Mos Def (\\"Stylo\\"), plus some soulful Bobby Womack (\\"Stylo\\", \\"Cloud of Unknowning\\") and a guest appearance be De La Soul (\\"Sweepstakes\\" and the whimsical \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\"), Plastic Beach leaves little room for the likes of Murdoc, 2D, Russell and Noodle.<br /><br />Plastic Beach is still a work of art, make no mistake--but be prepared for jarring nosedives into hip-hop that bounce back into alternative and experimental.  \\"White Flag\\" and the \\"Orchestral Intro\\" are truly beautiful...and they feel truly out of place.  Lou Reed was a surprising blast from the past in \\"Some Kind of Nature\\"and then we get a disco-Beatles bounce in \\"Melancholy Hill\\", one of the rare appearances by Damon Albarn (who sings the part of 2D). It almost feels as if Albarn and crew are a bit shy, and by the time they come out to play, the album's mostly over--hear them wave goodbye in the closing track \\"Pirate Jet\\"<br /><br />If you're the kind of person who likes Demon Days and has some pretty broad musical tastes, you'll find \\"Plastic Beach\\" provides you a nice variety of \\"different\\".  If you're looking for something more rhythmic, danceable, and holding the alt-pop appeal of the first two albums, this might take some listening to grow on you.
B0006399FS|2.0|U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind was a glorious comeback, but this follow-up was a major disappointment. It is one of their weakest albums, and only hard-cores should bother with it. Everything characteristic of good U2 is absent:  irresistible huge melodies, engagingly thought-provoking lyrics, atmospheric soundscapes, Bono's soaring voice, etc. The songs suffer above all from a distinct lack of melody and are generally uninteresting; in contrast to even most of the band's mediocre tracks, they are nearly all forgotten immediately. U2 should be commended for trying new things; it would have been easy to repeat All That, and nearly anyone else would have, but they kept experimenting as they always have. Unfortunately, though, the experiments are simply bland. Bono billed the album as U2's first real straight rock attempt. We can certainly see this in lead single \\"Vertigo,\\" but it is really not anywhere else. The rest is basically what anyone would think U2 would sound like if they failed to write good songs. In a sense it is good that the album is not full of \\"Vertigo\\"-like cuts - or would be if the rest were better. \\"Vertigo\\" is far from their best; it is initially interesting to hear driving rock, but the charm quickly wears off, and it becomes clear that the song is very minor. Its generic rock guitar does not equal The Edge's usual chiming chords, Bono's singing moves from boring to annoying, and the words are almost embarrassingly bad. This last does hold throughout the album, though thankfully to a lesser extent. Some complain about a lack of political lyrics, but this is not inherently bad; the same can after all be said of Achtung Baby, perhaps the band's masterpiece. The problem is that the lyrics are simply asinine, failing to tackle not only the big issues for which U2 is known but anything of worth. Bono has deftly probed non-political issues like love and human relationships, but this can hardly even be called superficial. He does continue his tradition of closing with a direct God address, but even it fails to move. His singing is also disappointing; he barely even tries to hit his signature high notes, and all his usual vocal acrobatics are sorely missed. It is of course unrealistic to expect him to sing as of yore, but anyone who has heard U2 live knows he can do better. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" is the only exception to all this - an affecting monster ballad of the kind only U2 can deliver. Casuals may want to get it somehow, but it is certainly not enough to justify buying the album. One should definitely have nearly every other U2 release before even considering this - if one ever considers it.
0307269752|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Yes it is a bit of a stretch of believability, but it is a novel after all. I was totally sucked into it and loved the Lisbeth character. I'm glad to see I'll read more about her in the next book. I thought the book was well written, but not stellar. Perhaps something was lost in translation.<br /><br />Was anyone else bothered by what seemed to be the equivalent of technology ad placements in the book? Every piece of technology is described by brand ... the laptop is never a laptop, it is always an iBook. She doesn't check her email when she got home, she \\"booted up her iBook and opened Eudora\\". He unpacked his things at the cottage and arranged his \\"Sanyo tape recorder, Microtek scanner ... a Minolta digital camera ...\\" The main character needs to create a database and uses the \\"NotePad programme ([...])\\" Yes, the URL is in the book. It all seems so strange to find this in a mystery novel, and for me a bit off-putting.<br /><br />I plan to read the second and perhaps third books because I like the characters and found reading the book engaging and fun.
B001CDLATE|3.0|Overall I liked it.  It started off really great, but then the time-lapse footage in the middle was kind of dull and just dragged on forever.

1595141715|5.0|Wow... this was by far the best book I have read so far this year!  It's a quick read but it packs a big punch.  The topic is very dark and sometimes depressing, but, somehow it manages to be uplifting at the same time.  I felt like I was sitting there listening to the tapes right along with Clay.  I felt his hope, and pain right along with him... and more than anything his hopelessness.  Becuase you know how it's goind to end... and there is nothing you can say or do to stop it.  I don't know what else to say except... READ THIS BOOK!  You won't regret it.  I'll be reading it again... after I make all my friends read it first.
6304981635|5.0|This is one of the the greatest(if not the greatest) martial arts movie ever made. A lot of people nowadays are into the flashy martial arts movies with lots of flips and stunts and unbelievable athletic performances. While I am a fan of those types of movies, \\"Enter the Dragon\\" stands in its own category. For those who are uninformed on the master who is Bruce Lee, he never did anything flashy or unnecessary. Other martial art movies are based on martial arts mastered by the cast in them, which are usually flashy arts such as Wushu or the many different styles of Kung fu. Bruce Lee does the same in this movie, only using his style of martial arts called Jeet Kune Do. JKD wasn't anything flashy. It was all about simplicity and it was meant for REAL fighting and/or self-defense. Nothing flashy, just finish your opponent(s) as simply and fast and efficient as possible. Bruce shows us his style in this movie. People complain there are no \\"combination's\\" or \\"flashy techniques\\" or \\"well choreographed fight scenes\\" in this movie. While they may be true to a certain extent, they do not understand that Bruce wasn't trying to be flashy. He didn't believe that one needed to learn many different combination's when one could end a fight simply with one hit. He felt many martial artists focused to much on making techniques \\"look good\\" that many neglected physical training to make simple techniques effective to end fights. Its not about winning a fight, but rather its about surviving a fight.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I saw this video on PBS and it was so beautiful.  I just had to have it.  The songs really touched the heart and soul.  It has been one of my favorites.  The harmonies are so angelic.  The melodies are beautiful.  It's a must have.
159562015X|4.0|i was assigned to read this and take the test as part of a management training program i am part of in my company.  it was so nice to read this fresh perspective, instead of focusing on weaknesses, this focused on how to capitalize on peoples' strengths, and the best approaches to working with them.  I showed my father, who is also a manager for another company, and he is having his entire team read this. this is a great book.

It was the most eye opening film I have ever seen! I loved it! It has changed my life and the way I eat. I had no idea the truth about our food. I am so thankful this movie was made. It was made very well and kept me at the edge of my seat waiting to hear more.
B002BW7A58|5.0|I have a few other Lil' Wayne albums, but this one is my favorite by far. It's got a lot more rock, but still stays true to his rap background. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. Prom Queen and Drop the World are the best tracks. If you don't like them, then you won't like the CD...and you are wierd.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|I really liked Casino Royal, and was hoping for this to be a good/great movie. No, all action and very lacking story. I feel they pumped so much action into this to cover such a slow, boring, story line. I truly like Daniel Craig as bond and was dissapointed that this movie is so average.<br />You'll have more fun playing the video game as bond than watching this movie.
1416550550|4.0|Having read \\"The House at Riverton\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed, I had to read \\"The Forgotten Garden.\\" I was not disappointed.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I'm planning . . . I take that back, I WILL be ordering this. This has been one of the best shows on TV for the past 6 years. Thanks ABC.       My only question is what special features will be loaded with this set.
B002WCLG48|4.0|Over all this product is well done and I am very happy that I bought it.  Halo Legends has eight different episode about 15 minutes each and they have some information that you don't get in the games.  Each episode is different in how its set up, some are funny were some are serious while some just explain halo.  Bones did a very good job on the videos but I think they could have done it with out \\"The Duel\\" and made the \\"The Package\\" the one with Master Chief with the computer animations less cheesy.  Over all this is a great product and was worth buying and if you are a halo fan then I recommend this to you.  Bones should start making a serious of Master Chief/Halo, That would be awesome!! =P
0307454541|2.0|I agree with the 5 star reviewers, this book was very well written, gripping and ultimately satisfying.

0891419063|5.0|With a little different spin from author E.B. Sledge, \\"With the Old Breed,\\" a personal memoir of island fighting in the Pacific, could have turned into an anti-war tome. Sledge does convey the grinding, often futile nature, tragedy, and dehumanizing impact of war with very little glory. He also vividly describes the gore, filth, and seemingly intolerable living conditions of a battlefield. However, it is all part of the story with nothing gratuitous or unnecessary.  It is hard to imagine anybody being inspired to head over to a recruiting station with the expectation of adventure and good times based on this book. There is no sweeping view of entire battles with generals directing armies. Instead, the reader is presented with a never-ending series of small battles with no apparent meaning besides destroying an enemy who refuses to surrender. Sledge fought in the battles on Peleliu and Okinawa, both among the hardest of World War II, which took its toll of his 1st Marine Division comrades one by one. On at least one occasion Sledge remarks that the only way out of the meat grinder seemed to be by death or a wound.  However, Sledge's point of view is that of a proud enlisted Marine who does his duty and will not let anybody down, while managing to simply survive. Home and the non-combatant world becomes a dim and surreal memory, but he never ceases to believe in righteousness of the Marines, his nation's cause, the baseness of the enemy, with little questioning of the worth of the privations and suffering he went through. Out of this, came a pride in his service and an appreciation for everything good in life and the best of people. The result is unforgettable and another tribute to The Greatest Generation.
B002BSHXJA|4.0|I, too, received a boot leg version of the box.  Some discs did not play in some cd players or computers.  I have never successfully ripped the stereo \\"bonus\\" portions of a couple of the discs.  Oh, and the cardboard sleeves were put together with the tabs stuck on the _outside_ of the jackets, obscuring the artwork.    As far as I know, the music is authentic (presumably no bits of music were lost on their trip through China).  I haven't had a chance to listen closely to every track.  My overall sense:  it's good to have remastered music, given the ancient status of the first digital versions.  It's fun to have slightly different mono takes of some material.  And much, though not all, of this music is absolutely central to the Western pop music tradition - and great fun. But the Beatles recorded music meant to be easily deciphered through budget systems in harsh conditions (car radios, portable record players) and so while there is deeper enjoyment there are few revelations.  Remastered reissues of Miles Davis' electric music completely changed my understanding of that period - I could finally hear what was going on.  The mono box isn't that kind of on the mountain experience.  But it's fun and - if you get a bootleg - relatively cheap.

030745455X|4.0|I'm only giving The Girl Who Played with Fire four stars instead of five due to my own anticipation. After reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, my expectations were high, WAY high as I awaited the release of this book with anticipation. When I received it, I held onto it for a couple of extra days. Knowing how fast paced the first book was, I wanted to save it for my plane trip so it would make the time pass more quickly (oh, how I sometimes hate to travel).<br /><br />The Girl Who Played With Fire is a good read. It's interesting. We're familiar with the characters. We're worried for Lisbeth when things seem to go wrong and cheering for her when she comes out on top. Stieg Larsson does a great job of tying in themes from the first book into this one and, I imagine, will continue to develop then wrap up the story line in the final book. I whipped through this book in a weekend. But, unlike the first book, I managed to run my errands as well:)
B002U33GUQ|5.0|Brad Mehldau is an amazing pianist and leads an equally amazing trio.  I had the good fortune of catching one of their shows at The Dakota Jazz Club, and was blown away by the trio's communication and choice of repertoire.  I bought a few of his albums -- including this one -- but Highway Rider was the last one I listened to.  While his earlier albums are ample evidence of his brilliant treatments of classic tunes, this album is a testament to his talent as a composer.<br /><br />Highway Rider almost seems like a concept album sans a story... but there is definitely a narrative here.  The music tells the story better than words ever could -- give the 2CD set a listen and you'll know what I'm talking about.  His performances and improvisations are ego-free.  There's only one solo piano piece on this album; that speaks for itself, I think.<br /><br />The orchestration is excellent.  I don't see why some people are writing it off as \\"elevator music\\" or \\"cheesy\\".  Does that make any and all orchestration in jazz \\"cheesy\\"?  No, sorry, it's only when it's blatantly commercial that it becomes annoying.  Here, it is obvious that Brad studied orchestration for a while before attempting to write these compositions.<br /><br />In short -- pick this one up if: you're a fan of harmonically interesting, melodic, modern jazz; you enjoyed Brad's more ambitious compositions; you don't mind tasteful orchestration; you are able to temper your expectations accordingly.  This isn't another trio album.  As much as I love piano trios, this is Brad's best work.  While he is only 39, it may seem too early to call this album his \\"magnum opus\\".  But it will take a lot to top this record.
0307454541|5.0|Fast-paced and interesting. You'll be sucked into the story from page 1. Although sections of the book maybe a bit graphic for some readers (hey, it's Swedish), these moments weren't gratuitous. Stieg Larrson did a wonderful job developing the characters and tying them together in a clever and interesting way. As soon as I finished reading the book, I was ready for the sequel. I started this book on a Friday night and didn't get to bed until the wee hours of the morning because I just couldn't put it down. Needless to say, some of my errands and chores didn't quite get done that Saturday because I HAD TO finsh the book.

My daughter (senior in high school) asked me to purchase this book so she'd have a thick read to last through her week of Spring break. Shantaram is beautifully written. Gregory David Roberts uses masterful prose to bring to life the sights, sounds and scents of India. His writing is infused with emotion that ties you to the characters in his book. Your heart will burst love, ache with sadness, harden with anger and struggle with conflict. We will all read thousands of good books over our lifetime, but very few will be considered great and be one of THE books that you recommend over and over again to your friends, family, coworkers and anyone who appreciates such exquisite writing. Shantaram is such a book. Trust me.
0446563048|1.0|I have heard of Zappos so I thought to myself that this book may seem like an interesting read.  However, the first few pages of the book immediately put me off.  You are met with a feeling of arrogance in the writing.  The tone is pretty much as follows: I goofed off a lot,  I got into every top university I applied to even though I was a slacker in high school, I was torn between going to Brown which I liked and Harvard which my parents thought was better, I made money at Harvard by taking advantage of other students in my class while at the same time ending up doing no work at all, then somehow I was able to make a bunch of money, and I want you to go read my book which I am writing without any assistance so the grammar might not be perfect.
0385523386|4.0|This is an engaging memoir that focuses narrowly on the author's year in prison for  her part in a drug ring. It covers her decision to plead guilty , the 5 years( !) she spent awaiting sentencing, and her adjustment to  life in federal prison once she began serving her sentence. She vivdly describes conditions, lack of rehabilitative programs, and lack of basic human dignity,  but focuses on the wide variety of women she meets. She gives credit to the other prisoners for helping her, and tries to do the same when she's not new anymore. Once she is nearing the end of her sentence, she is sent on \\"con air\\" to Chicago  when she is required to testify  for the prosecution at another trial. She is kept at several harsher prisons on the way, and clearly this period was the most difficult of her entire incarceration.<br /><br />Some may feel that a  privileged woman who willingly took part in a drug ring deserves what she got, (and certainly  does not deserve a book contract) but that is Kerman's point. She admits her guilt, accepted her sentence, and while in prison clearly saw the effects that the drug trade has on individuals and society. She states repeatedly that she knows how fortunate she is compared to most prisoners, both in her short sentence and the life she will be returning to once released.<br /><br />I wish that the book had not ended abruptly at the moment of Kerman's release and that there was at least a brief epilogue on her return to normal life, but this does not seriously detract from this competently written and absorbing memoir.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|It has been brought to my attention that I am less than objective when critiquing anything Natalie does and my affection for her music.  That disclaimer aside, this CD set is a remarkable surprise on a number of levels.  You would think that starting with the lyrics written by some of the best poets of the past hundred or so years would be sort of like cheating, but placing them in this context with the music and interpretation you can hear was a tremendous effort.  You can hear the labor of love the project was; the meticulous construction that still makes the songs so accessible - so timeless as well.    Most of all, and maybe why the set just strikes me as brilliant, is that the poetry/songs come across with the melody I hear in my head when read them.  I wish I had read the booklet first and then listened.      Speaking of the booklet, as opposed to most CD booklets enclosed as a bonus, the book with this set is critical to your listening and digesting the entire project.  While your enjoyment might not be diminished, your appreciation of the entire effort will be.    Just buy it.  And buy this 2-CD set edition.  You aren't going to get one and three-quarters hours of music, a book and the amount of enjoyment for less.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|The sound quality of these headphones is amazing. The Surround Sound helps tremendously with many of the games I play. The best feature for the xbox is chat boost and the simple ability to hear chat and game sound though the same headphones. These headphones can also be use with any device with and digital audio port or a normal left right line in. You may want to cheat the Turtle Beach website to see what exactly come with them and what you can buy that is extra.    Pros  Sound Quality  Surround Sound  Xbox Chat  Chat Boost  Removable mic boom  Very comfortable fit - Over the ear and cloth mesh make for a very easy were on any size of ear    Cons  Uses batteries fast - I highly suggest buying some AAA rechargeable batteries. These headphone will eat through a pair in two days depending on how much you use them.  Slight interference - You will hear a slight hum whenever the headphones are turn on, and if you have a strong wireless network and you a far away from the headphone tower you may hear some snaps and pops    Other  I will note that while playing a normal or loud game you will not able to hear anything in the surrounding area besides the game and chat, whether this is a good or bad thing depends on a person's personal preferences. ;-)    Final Thought  These headphones are not cheap, but are the best quality I have ever seen. If you want a slightly less expensive pair I would suggest the Ear Force X31 which are stereo.

Terry Gilliam is a top notch director who never ceases to amaze his audience. The only reason why anybody should be seeing this movie is because there a Gilliam fan. Yes Heath Ledger is a legend and this is his last official movie but Heath Ledger presence alone shouldn't influence anybody to see any movie.

B0033AX26I|5.0|A project that is sweet in its fruition. The exploration of this blending of Mexican and Irish themes is right in keeping with the high standards which both Ry Cooder and the Chieftains have shown in their earlier works. The music is as rich as the liner notes are sparse, leading the listener to research this chapter in Irish/Mexican/American history. The harp playing is exceptional, but missing the touch of Derek Bell. Altogether a worthy effort, embellished with guest artists, known and unknown to me. Linda Ronstadt is always a treat.

B0013GTNIA|4.0|I was blown away by the 30 second clips and intend to buy.    Most of this sounded to me like a \\"New Age meets Jazz\\" type of album with some electronic tracks thrown in that have more melody than normal \\"Dance/DJ\\" music.    Then, I did some research on this group on the web. Bajofondo is a group with roots in Uruguay/Argentina with some very interesting sounds.    I strongly encourage you to give this album a listen and research them on the web. Quite an interesting and fresh set of sounds.

B0011UBDTK|4.0|It may be a landmark and a turning point for a whole generation, yes, of course. But \\"Sex And the City\\" is, first of all, an extremely entertaining, cleverly written portrait of living in New York in the late 90's/early 2000's - and that is regardless of your genre.<br />The series deals primarily with relationships (its pursuit, the lack of it, what happens when you got it, what happens when you're through with it) and that is universal.<br />Not all characters were satisfyingly developed from the get-go, and the series itself took some time to find its own identity. Season 1 was very experimental, but when it found its voice, it became notorious, and unforgettable.<br />It's completely addictive and I have just revisited the whole series as a preparation for the second movie - and I have to say I can still find different nuances in some episodes. There's a lot to think about in it.<br />But like I said, it is, first and foremost, a hell of an entertaining ride definitely worth taking. Get Carried Away.
0307463745|4.0|I had read \\"Getting real\\" and use Basecamp.<br />It's easy and fun to read; with a pinch of salt, of course.<br />The ideas put forward in this book are what I would call \\"irreverent commonsense\\".<br />It questions the \\"well behaved\\" manner of doing business and develop products and it is a \\"must read\\" specially for to open minds; we know, in the software industry, that certain classical approaches to development are a sure recipe for failure (actually they(we) carry on copying other industries that are intrinsically different: assembly lines and building/civil engineering);  but that is still what some customers/decision makers want to hear because \\"it's serious\\".<br />I recommend this book to my students, not only for the ideas it presents but also for them to create a mental habit of good irreverence that can lead to innovation and better ways of doing things.

0385343248|5.0|This is easily one of the most enjoyable and rewarding historical fiction novels I've ever read.  John Blackthorne's adventures in pre-industrial Japan immerse the reader in the rich Samurai culture of that time in a way that is simply amazing.  The drama, suspense, and action of SHOGUN are absolutely top-notch, making this much more than just an educational experience about Japanese culture and history, but a highly successful adventure story that keeps the reader engaged throughout the long book.  The characters here are also extremely well done, being memorable, unique, and very believable.  In all, this book has earned a top place in the list of my favorite books of all time, and I won't hesitate for a second to recommend it to any reader.<br /><br />Based on the real-life adventures of the English pilot William Adams (1564-1620; named Miura Anjin and Samurai by the future Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu), SHOGUN tracks nicely with actual historical events that led up to the isolationist era in Japanese history.  Indeed, nearly all of the characters in this book are based on real Japanese historical figures (but with slightly altered names).  Knowing this only helps to make the intense drama of this story that much more powerful.  The way James Clavell portrays the culture of the Japanese Samurai is simply amazing.  Seemingly authentic, Clavell paints a picture of a proud and honor-obsessed society that, while unforgiving and often brutal, retains a tantalizing beauty and tranquility that the reader (and John Blackthorne) learns to admire.  A culture as different from our own as you can imagine, the Samurai way of life as portrayed by Clavell is both scary and oddly attractive.  When living around touchy men with swords almost looking for an excuse to test their blades, walking on pins and needles doesn't begin to describe the way Anjin-san must behave to survive.  The strict and formal relationships between husband and wife, child and parent, or master and slave is jarringly inconsistent with what we take to be a fair and just society.  But the cleanliness, politeness, respectfulness, and spiritual peacefulness are aspects of Clavell's 14-15th century Japan that most will find appealing, and will cause sadness that these times are long past and that this culture has all but disappeared.  Certainly my favorite aspect of this book is its reliable-seeming reconstruction of this almost mystical Japan, and the legitimate historical nature of the story.<br /><br />Of course, this is also a book full of fast-paced action, intense emotion, and engulfing drama.  Blackthorne's interactions with the various characters in this book are wide and varied, from deeply connecting with initially strange-seeming people, to hair-raising standoffs with intensely dangerous adversaries.  As the Anjin-san becomes immersed in the Samurai culture and begins to appreciate the various aspects of life in Japan, he undergoes one of the most dramatic (but believable) transformations of any I can think of in modern-day literature.  Love, hate, peace, and frustration are at continuous conflict in his mind, but as his transformation reaches completeness he gradually learns to accept his karma, and take life as it comes.  A very well-done and dramatic story at the heart of this epic novel.<br /><br />Also, Clavell's writing style in SHOGUN is part of what makes it such a success.  The way he is able to switch between different characters' viewpoints without missing a beat (or loosing the reader) is something that I don't believe I have come across before.  And it works wonderfully here, as the story flows extremely smoothly from event to event, person to person, keeping the reader fully engaged and allowing Clavell to get whichever perspective would be best for individual situations to the front.  Also, his willingness to use Japanese words in the dialogue was highly successful.  Again without loosing the reader, Clavell incorporates common Japanese phrases throughout the story, rarely with a direct translation, giving even more authenticity to the already very believable story.  Indeed, through the course of reading this book, you'll find that you actually learned a bit of conversational Japanese!  If, like me, you find yourself looking forward to seeing your Japanese friends or colleagues so that you can greet them with \\"Kinnichi wa!\\", don't be surprised.<br /><br />In all, I can't recommend this book enough.  Well worth the significant amount of time and effort you'll spend on reading this one, SHOGUN succeeds in every way.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />Domo Arigato, Mr. Clavell.with a direct translation, giving even more authenticity to the already very believable story.

B002UNMW7O|5.0|As always, Amazon offers movies, even new movies, at good prices. As for the movie, it's not as good as the first one, but what sequel is? It's still vastly entertaining, with most of the original cast in addition to \\"the boys\\" as they return to Boston to avenge the killing of a priest after a long time in hiding. The story progression was very similar to the original film, with enough new material to keep it from feeling like déjà vu. I was concerned about Rocko's \\"replacement\\" initially, I feared that his ethnicity would be \\"overdone\\", but it never occurred to me again, Clifton Collins Jr. put in a solid performance as the comic relief, being given a slew of fabulous lines. Julie Benz is amazing as the sultry-yet-tough southern belle FBI agent sent in to investigate the first murder, and supposedly track down the Saints. It's a pity we had to wait 10 years for this, but it was worth the wait. Great action, great story.

I was thrilled to see that he already finished the second book, Freedom.  I took a break from reading Freedom to write this review.  I don't think I have ever felt such a strong sense of grim amusement after reading about the spammers.  This book was recommended to me by a completely non-technical person, so it is definitely not just something IT's will like.  I think this will end up being one of those books that are referred to in a hundred years by historians as an example of a visionary author who was able to correctly grasp the scope of events in our time and predict where our course would run, (nice long sentence...).  Thank you very much for writing this book!  It has inspired me to learn even more about the field I am in, especially the security aspects, as I have always been lax in that area.  I hope you make enough money from your career as an author to enjoy all of the toys in your books, lol!

Through out is the voice. Expressing anger, violence, and love.  Given my description, if you think you can handle this - it is an incredible body (no pun intended) of work.

0805091742|5.0|For me, the stunning results cited in this book place it in the top four or five books I've read recently.  Significant life savings, dollar savings, complications/after-effect improvement (quality improvements)...results from Michigan and from around the world.  All three results achieved from the same activity.<br /><br />I noticed that most of the 3-or-below reviewers cited a lack of 'how,' and that many of the positive reviewers commented on this as well.  For those concerned about 'how:'<br /><br />I see the 'how' as implicit in several of Gawande's anecdotes.  To cite just one:  the hypothermia/drowning victim (pps. 15-19).<br /><br />In order to achieve this stunning result--reviving a child 'dead' for 90 minutes--the Austrian medical team had to reach beyond the traditional definition to 'all-related-members:' the search/rescue, emergency medical technician as well as a broad collection of physician, surgeon and nurse specialists.  In order to effect the 'rescue,' they needed to front-load as many life-saving techniques as possible--many of them implemented as soon as the victim's discovery, many carried out en route to the hospital.  All the hospital specialists were notified and assembled while the child was en route.  They were on hand and prepared when she arrived.<br /><br />Also, they used what I'd call 'simultaneous medicine,' implementing the medical countermeasures in parallel where possible, or in unusually rapid succession.<br /><br />To pull this all together, they surely had to have extensive exchange of information across the work-roles.  I expect they continue to discover ways to improve the odds of survival, by iterating through these activities:<br /><br />(1) pull together 'all-related-members'<br />(2) front-load activity<br />(3) use simultaneous activity where possible<br />(4) exchange information and collaborate across the specialties<br />(5) improve, improve, improve<br /><br />I find gems too numerous to mention in this book.  Dr. Gawande observes, for instance, that checklists are 'simple' and yet have incredible impact.  Yes, simple but not easy.<br /><br />Creating checking mechanisms requires making tacit knowledge (stored in the 'silo' of individual or team expertitise) into explicit knowledge which can be understood and applied across all-related-members.  This can be difficult because individuals don't always understand the benefit of sharing--or are afraid or threatened.<br /><br />Dr. Gawande asks the multi-billion dollar question on p. 161:  can medical culture seize the opportunity represented by these checklist activities?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, there are anecdotes across many industries.

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|It has honestly nearly been one year since the heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, and throughout that time, many new fans of all ages have finally re-discovered the brilliance of what made The King Of Pop a strong influence for so many generations of artists from Britney Spears and Beyonce', to Usher and Chris Brown. Nevertheless, it has been a very rough loss that still hasn't sunk in for so many of his hard core fans of all ages that remains a devistation. While there have been so many different hits collections that've been strong and reflective of his carrer, there just hasn't been anything that fully defined Michael Jackson. But for those hard core fans, this might've rocked the world over.<br /><br />Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection is a 4 disc boxed set that mostly showcases why his songs and his success have been so strong to anyone that has loved him, even through all the heartbreak he went through during his final years with the lackluster promotion of Invincible and his child molestation trial, to being labeled him \\"Wacko Jacko.\\" Nevertheless, it has been too easy to forget why his songs are still constants. The collection includes a lot of his great songs including Black Or White, Thriller, the intimate Man In The Mirror, all the way to classics like She's Out Of My Life and Thriller. The collection does also include some of Michael's overshadowed gems like Childhood, The Girl Is Mine with Paul McCartney and Who Is It? While the collection of songs is mostly strong, a lot of gems from Michael's career weren't actually showcased and recognized here including They Don't Care About Us, Scream with his sister Janet Jackson, his other duet with Paul McCartney on Say Say Say, and The Lady Of My Life from Thriller.<br /><br />Despite a handful of songs that could've been showcased, Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection is mostly a straight-forward reflection but not completely a definitive sight of why Michael Jackson was so strong. Although it does have his 1993 concert from Bucharest to make up for what wasn't here like Will You Be There, it still could've been in its original audio form. Still, there would've more than just a simple stranger in Moscow to have been shown to why Michael Jackson was The King Of Pop, but this is better than most of the other hits collections like 2003's Number Ones that Michael had showcased from his life.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B-93 concert from Bucharest to make up for what wasn't here like Will You Be There, it still could've been in its original audio form.

B001P9KR8U|1.0|I love this movie, but I bought a copy from Amazon and it wouldn't work in multiple DVD players. I exchanged it for another copy from Amazon and had the same problem. I ended up buying a used copy from Blockbuster and it was fine. Fortunately, Amazon has a great return policy. I've never had a problem with Amazon before and haven't since, but I think this was a bad batch of movies.
B00328G4V6|5.0|Been a Hendrix fan since the late 60's, and even had the good fortune to see him perform in '67 with Chicago as opening band (the year after Hendrix toured and opened for The Monkeys). After all the re-releases, and re-packaging of mostly unpopular \\"second\\" tracks, I find this release to be extremely good, one in which the real essence of Jimi can be felt once again. Every group of friends I've played this for got up on their feet and began to smile. Not perfect, but very good.
0762188669|4.0|Charles De Gaulle is the target.  It is easy to imagine Fosythe's plot of an assassination attempt on the life of the President of France, Charles De Gaulle.  The \\"Jackal\\", is basically an unknown hit man, hired to kill this president who, in my estimation, does not rank highly in the esteem of his fellow countrymen.  One can almost cheer the efforts of the \\"Jackal\\" in his pursuit of the aristocratic, overbearing De Gaulle.  One almost hopes that Claude Lebel, the best detective in the service of France, will fail in his chase to forestall the inevitable.<br /><br />Although it is a forgone conclusion that the \\"Jackal\\" will fail in his objective, the climactic finish to this story will keep the reader on the edge of his seat.  It seems that despite the best efforts of Lebel, De Gaulle will be shot, particulary when he looms in the sniper scope of the assassin.  The movie, based on this writing, is as exciting as the book and actually helps us envision the chase across Europe which ends in Paris.  Both the book and the movie are presented in a thrilling manner that will stick with you long after you see or read \\"The Day of the Jackal\\".
B00005YW4H|5.0|Excellent and promt response from the seller. The product came in outstanding shape and I really like it. I would definitely use the same seller again. I am very pleased.
0802714544|5.0|What can one say about a novel by a master storyteller that is not laudatory?  If you really thought about it it should be required reading by anyone interested in playing the \\"spy\\" game.  Le Carre has presented us with a devilishly clever plot line which holds your interest page after page.  Le Carre has you in his grip and won't let you go as he makes you wonder where he is leading you and what comes next in this thriller.  There is no need to spell out all the details since it is written in a manner which challenges your imagination totally as you get deeper and deeper into this mystery.    There is very little of this saga that in uninteresting.  The characters, the plot, the interplay, makes one come away with the feeling that all the characters are totally involved in an action which makes this story one of the finest spy stories ever written.  This is a page turner which holds you and never lets you down.  Viva Le Carre!!    E.J. Walden, author of \\"Operation Snow Owl\\"
B000001EAQ|4.0|I bought Pop and Zooropa to finish my U2 collection. This album was supposedly a terrible album and U2s weak point. I think the opposite. Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop are the strangest albums in U2s catalog (after Original Soundtracks 1). This period in the 90s is amazing. Their experimentation and sound is unbelievable after hearing albums like Rattle and Hum which has a classic rock and blues sound    Some songs like Discotheque and Mofo are very strange and you might not like them the first listen but they grow on you. I also think this album is more emotional than Zooropa and a bit depressing. If god will send his angels is pretty beautiful and please is too. If you wear that velvet dress is a great piece. Staring at the sun is the commercial single in this album and it is very cool although i prefer other songs. Wake up dead man makes this album 3 times better. Its sad lyrics are a great album closer.    Summary: Dont be fooled. Buy this and Zooropa and you will love them unless your one of those classic 80s U2 fans.  I think this is a lot better than the albums they are doing now.
0385342039|5.0|I adored this book.  I had my doubts at first but ended up loving it.  It was funny with a heart and I was completely taken aback by how much I ended up invested in the characters.  If you don't mind a little bend in reality then you will adore this book just like I did.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|Reading the positive reviews here, I am just SHOCKED. I wonder if I watched the same \\"movie\\" as those giving it anything anything over one star.  There was no plot; a mind-numbing amount of the movie was spent watching, through a jerking camera lens, a going-away party for someone who wasn't even present.  It went on FOREVER.  I kept waiting for something exciting to happen at any moment, which caused me to waste precious moments of my life--ones that I can never get back :(  The \\"monsters,\\" who were incredibley laughable in their appearance, and only appeared at the very end of the movie, were not believable at all.  I am so glad I didn't waste even more money by purchasing the blu-ray version.<br /><br />If you are expecting a dazzling, action-packed, visually stunning (why was it even made in blu-ray???), edge-of-your-seat movie, definitely DON'T buy this one.  If you are still curious enough to watch it, rent it from Netflix instead.  If you somehow do find yourself liking it, then spend the money.  I wish I had, but I trusted the description that was printed on the outside of the case, and now I just want to throw it away; it's not worth its space in our dvd cabinet.  Maybe I can sell it to some other sucker and get some of my money back.
B003ELOQD4|4.0|i saw this show in camp nou in barcelona on july 2 was great!!! and this show was good too i saw on youtube live but i think better was edit the dvd/bd of a european tour anyway i gonna buy this one!!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Impressive in Blu-Ray, you really feel like you are a part of the action. Lots of details can be seen because of the quality, that you would not have seen in the DVD quality versions. Everything about this movie is stunning, but especially in Blu-Ray.
0375714839|3.0|I bought this to read for our book group and didn't expect to like it. I was wrong. It's a compelling story told in a unique way.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Amazing quality and the only way to see such a majestic movie. Beautiful cinematics, and Russell Crowe plays his part beautifully. Every little detail is perfect and the bonus DVD is a plus should we ever be without a Blu-Ray player. Highly recommended. Blu-Ray is the only way to ever watch any movie.
0810994739|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is about Greg and his brother Rodrick.  Greg is a bossy, funny and easy going middle schooler.  He gets in trouble because he just wants to have a good time.  But his dad is ruining things for him by making Greg join the swim team. Greg doesn't like it at all.  He'd rather join the water jazz class with the old ladies.  Greg's big problem, in the story is that Rodrick is blackmailing him.  Rodrick is forcing Greg to not tell their parents about a wild party he had at his house.  If Greg tells about the party, he'll spill a big secret about Greg...how he ate the moldy, stinky cheese on the playground!!  Greg finally tells his parents about the party at their house, but Rodrick thinks that Manny, their 3year-old brother told.  In the end, Greg and Rodrick team up to finish Rodrick's science project.  I like the book because everything is laugh out loud and funny.
B0037W68F4|5.0|Hi fellas.     Hate to be the bearer of bad news and all, but I'm afraid your new album \\"Congratulations\\" was simply too good for many folks to comprehend, hence you're now forced to defend your integrity against the critical obtuse masses.     Please don't be disheartened; and don't you dare apologize for anything!     I think you're new album is brilliant from head to toe, I really do. And I'm not alone, (Apparently 65,999 other people think it's pretty sweet as well).     It takes a lot of chutzpah to make an album so bizarre & eccentric as this. Especially knowing there's so much interest and expectations riding on it. Most might buckle; sacrifice what they want in lieu of what the label and the public wants. But you guys didn't succumb to their pie charts. You spat on their demographic surveys! You made the album you wanted to make. And for that I say \\"thanks\\".    And congratulations.      Stick to your guns, O pioneers!     ~Matt McClure
141654917X|5.0|And, at what price to those who love you, should you be free to decide your medical fate?<br /><br />On the cover of this book, it says, \\"... beautifully crafted novel will grab readers with its stunning topic.\\"  That is an understatement.  There are many twists and turns that no matter how strong a reader you are, you will be surprized, many times over.<br /><br />This book, no matter what side of medical ethics you stand on, will permeate your entire mind, soul, skin and day to day activities.  There are questions and emotions that will well up from within you, never mind all the many that come up from each character in this novel.  This book led me to ask questions about ethics, medical laws, children's rights, what it means to be a parent, and how challenging it would be as a parent, to not have the answers for your young children; answers that you think you are suppose to have.  Answers that have more questions.<br /><br />And, throughout this novel, I liked each character, except for the mother - until the last forty pages, where readers really get to see who she is, and what drives her.<br /><br />Reading this book, compells me to study medical ethics, individual rights and moral versus legal rights.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more books by Jodi Picoult.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|NOT because it's of Japanese origin---admittedly, I'm biased---but I can't recommend too highly Departures (Okuribito), the Academy Award-winning foreign language film of a couple of years ago. The star, Masahiro Motoki (ex-teen idol-turned-actor), comes from the world of Japanese boy bands---Johnny's Boys ---and the director, Yojiro Takita, is out of Japanese soft porn \\"adult\\" films (think Radley Metzger). Talk about changing horses in mid-stream!    Departure's arc from conception to realization took fifteen years, according to director Takita in an interview that comes with the DVD of the film. And, he informs, it was totally a group effort, i.e., improv, commitment, story contributions (the germ of the idea for film was Mokoki's), etc. I was amused by it, and, alternately, shed a tear or three as well. As the saying goes. . .\\"I laughed. I cried. I loved every minute of it.\\" As someone else recently wrote within these pages, \\"Departures is surely the gentlest, sweetest movie about death that you will ever see.\\"
B001TKKAH8|5.0|This is the legendary debut. The lilting poetry of Suzanne lures the listener into Cohen's world of spiritual and romantic yearning while introducing the essence of his sound: a deep monotone framed by sublime female backing vocals over simple but engaging melodies.<br /><br />Master Song, Winter Lady and Stranger Song reinforce the desolate landscape although the melodies are less immediate. Cohen's genius shines brightly on the immortal Sisters Of Mercy, a strange mixture of the devotional and the sensual that must be one of the most beautiful musical poems in the English language.<br /><br />This delicate gem is followed by the powerful and evocative So Long Marianne and the understated Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye, both masterpieces of words, melody and arrangement - the female vocals on Goodbye are especially impressive.<br /><br />Stories of the Street appears as a poem in one of Cohen's 1960s poetry books: [[ASIN:0670002348 Selected Poems 1956-1968]] and deals with a visit to Havana during or just after the revolution. Interesting fact: The line \\"some girls wander by mistake\\" from Teachers was later used as an album title by the goth band Sisters Of Mercy: [[ASIN:B000005RMY Some Girls Wander By Mistake]]<br /><br />One Us Cannot Be Wrong addresses the beloved in a series of strange images before moving on to melodic whistling and ending with bitter shouted la la lahs. For those interested in other artists' take on Cohen: Suzanne has been beautifully covered by inter alia Judy Collins [[ASIN:B0002M5TE8 Sings Leonard Cohen: Democracy]] and Geoffrey Oryema: [[ASIN:B000002ISX I'm Your Fan]], while Sting and the Chieftains' celtic version of Sisters Of Mercy is available on the [[ASIN:B000001EZK Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen]] tribute album.<br /><br />On the I'm Your Fan tribute there are interesting interpretations of Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye by Ian McCulloch, Stories Of The Street by That Petrol Emotion and So Long Marianne by James. Stirring live versions of Sisters Of Mercy, So Long Marianne & Suzanne appear on the [[ASIN:B001RTP3YQ Live In London]] CD & DVD of 2008.ercy, So Long Marianne & Suzanne appear on the [[ASIN:B001RTP3YQ Live In London]] CD & DVD of 2008.
0618154051|5.0|I'm enjoying reading through the stories and connecting Tolkien's brilliant storytelling with the rest of the world he imagined.  It's well worth it.
B00005NUXS|4.0|These Ten New Songs from 2001 are quite subdued and at first listen they all have the same slow gentle sound. But the old magic's still there on classics like In My Secret Life, Love Itself, The Land of Plenty and the elegant Alexandra Leaving. To be honest, this is not Cohen's most memorable album, nothing like the early classics or later masterpieces such as [[ASIN:B0000028W9 The Future]].<br /><br />Cohen covers familiar themes and one even recognizes lines from earlier songs, e.g. \\"I do what I am told,\\" on That Don't Make It Junk, while the elegiac mood of The Land Of Plenty reminds me of Heart With No Companion from [[ASIN:B0012GMW7A Various Positions]], an intense devotional with a sentiment of complete resignation and acceptance.<br /><br />By The Rivers Dark which refers to Psalm 137 about singing a song to the Lord by the [[ASIN:B00005QD6U Rivers of Babylon]], contain oblique [[ASIN:1930143893 autobiographical]] elements. The most explicitly spiritual track The Land of Plenty is the highlight of the album and stirring in its melancholy honesty: \\"For what's left of our religion/I lift my voice and pray/May the lights in the land of plenty/Shine on the truth some day\\".<br /><br />I enjoy Cohen's unusual excursions like [[ASIN:B0012GMVY4 Death of a Ladies' Man]] and the esoteric [[ASIN:B0012GMX3S Recent Songs]] as much as his classic acoustic style so I have no problem with the synth-pop production. I love Sharon Robinson's vocals as backing and where she duets with him on tracks like Boogie Street and the exquisite Alexandra Leaving.<br /><br />For more than five decades Cohen has been constructing a magnificent body of work that stands up to serious scrutiny and the passage of time. What a pleasure then, that these ten songs - his first offering of the new millennium - closely approach the same sublime artistry. The follow-up, 2004's [[ASIN:B0002MPTDO Dear Heather]] is even better in its greater stylistic variety.
0151013837|5.0|I read Pi in 2003 and I loved it then...so much. It was one of the best book club discussions we ever had. So imagine my delight when I discovered a new, first edition in my local bookstore where Yann Martel will be visiting later this week for his new book.  This new edition is just as lovely as my original Winnie the Pooh book that I received as a gift when it was originally published in 1961 and was only available at Harrods of London.<br /><br />The paintings are so beautiful... beautiful beyond description. They pop up in all sorts of unexpected places at just the right moment. All of the paintings are of what young Pi might be witnessing, so we get to look through his eyes, his perspective. The story made me laugh, made me anxious all over again, made me cry with both sadness and joy (both feeling were present as Pi, a devout vegetarian kills his first fish) and made me sigh with satisfaction and relief.<br /><br />This book may not be suitable for very small children, but it does look suspiciously like a children's book. I would recommend it to any child who can deal with the moral life and death issues in Harry Potter, but not to a child who is so young that Winnie would really float their boat.<br /><br />One can read all over the net what the actual story is about. That's not how I like to review books. But if you like graphic novels and art and adventure, then purchase this book now! It is deeply spiritual, funny, wise and will take you on a voyage impossible to ever forget. I do wish there would have been a bit more from Mr. Martel about the artwork, but you can see the process on the Amazon.com products page. So that is satisfying enough. 5/5 stars.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|The movie is a 5. Only the movie. I'm tired of double or at times triple dipping on dvd's. I will not throw my money away when they should just do right by fans the first time around. 6/8/10, I did buy the movie on blu-ray anyway(day it came out). My point still stands about double and triple dipping. The movie looks fantastic even on my home theater. I would reccomend as a buy, just disappointed with no special features.
0061914177|5.0|I first discovered GV in 2007. My friends and I launched our own website late that year and followed his advice. We hustled, got in the trenches, worked hard, and most of all we cared. 3 years later, we have one of the largest and most influential sites in our niche and new and exciting opportunities are presented to us almost daily. Sure we're not millionaires but we're HAPPY and so grateful that we to get to do what we do everyday. We've made so many friends along this journey and the experiences that we have been blessed to receive have been tremendous. This was all made possible because of the lessons from Gary and he covers almost all of them in this book (Gotta save some stuff for 'The Thank You Economy ;) ).    This book is not for those looking to make a quick buck, or think they can cruise their way to millions. This is for people who want to change the world and their lives in the process. Business is not easy, but it has never been easier to get into the game. The tools and what really matters is what is in this book.
B00383ZTXO|3.0|Well, not really. But I prefer the Iggy Pop mix (i.e. the reissue before this reissue). Iggy's version is much \\"Raw\\"-er, bringing the fantastic guitar work to the forefront where it belongs. They should have made an ultra-deluxe version with both mixes and the live stuff - I'd buy that. Although, this might be worth the money just for the live disc. I get tried of stuff I've owned for ten years being reissued. Why not find a band that sounds as good as the Stooges (not a carbon copy, by any means) and release new music for a change? Speaking of which, if you dig the Stooges you should check out Awesome Color - the exception to reissues and bad music.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Season 2 of Castle made me laugh harder than while any sit-com I've seen in the last few years.   The writing and acting on this show are absolutely phenominal. Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have such amazing chemistry together.  The show manages to blend the daily life mix of comedy and drama which is what real life is more like.     The Double Down is one of the funniest episodes of the season and Tick, Tick, Tick & Boom will keep you guessing. The show wouldn't be what it is though without the great writing and the amazing supporting cast. My husband and look forward to every Monday night for this show. I highly recommend this DVD series if you want to watch an entertaing, quality show.
0142405809|5.0|The Snail and the Whale is a beautifully illustrated book, with tongue twisting rhyme and strong themes. The snail wants to explore the world and does so by making an unlikely alliance with a humpback whale. After exploring far away and vast lands, the snail concludes that he feels very small indeed. The snail symolizes young children who are curious about their world, and how they can feel insignificant in the world. However, the smallest creature can make a difference, as in the story the small snail helps his friend the whale and in doing so draws attention to the plight of endangered species and how each individual can make a difference to the world.     I have also recently written a new children's book in which a young princess's curiosity about a forest leads her to exploring the forest and making some unexpected friends. A spell cast will test Zaara's bravery-and with no loyal subjects to come to her rescue, she is on her own in the deep, dark forest. Come what may, Zaara has learned the true power of friendship and that if this circle of friendship is to be unbroken, she will lead the way as a princess-and as a friend.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|No Blu-Ray collection is complete without a well-transfered vintage movie, and I'm happy to say that Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 masterpiece 'North by Northwest' is a worthy choice for that movie.    The film itself needs no introduction.  It's a classic, pure and simple.  From the wonderful performances by Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint to the jaw-dropping Mount Rushmore and (my personal favorite) crop duster sequences, 'North by Northwest' is a high-caliber suspense film, through and through.      One aspect that sets it apart from many other movies of its day is the test of time.  Even though it hit movie theaters more than 50 years ago, the action and humor in 'North by Northwest' have aged very well.  I still laugh out loud when I watch it, and the suspense is still just as nail-biting.    As for the Blu-Ray transfer, I don't think we could've asked for a better one.  As far as I'm concerned, the purpose behind the Blu-Ray format is to make the home viewing experience as close to the theatrical experience as possible.  This beautifully-produced Blu-Ray does just that.  The incredibly sharp picture effectively transports the viewer back in time to a theater seat in 1959, right down to the old-school film grain.    The special features here are very impressive, including a standout documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint.  If you appreciate extras, you won't be disappointed.  My favorite, for some reason, is the featurette titled \\"A Guided Tour with Alfred Hitchcock.\\"  It's a genuinely funny and witty look at the movie, and shouldn't be missed.    Additionally, the Blu-Ray comes packaged with a 44-page Digibook, which is a very appreciated addition.  It includes facts about the production as well as profiles of the actors.  Very cool packaging.    Classic movies like this are a treat to behold on the Blu-Ray format.  'North by Northwest' is no exception.  If you're looking for a wonderful piece of cinematic history that showcases the format beautifully, then look no further than 'North by Northwest.'  It's absolutely a must-buy.
B000094HMU|5.0|Ever since my taste in music did a 180 and all I now listen to is classical music, I have been in love with nessun dorma.  One of my newer recordings had this breathtaking climax of music that turned out to be the Turandot's first act closing.  That sealed it for me, I had to see the opera.  My PBS station aired it and I recorded it.  In replaying it, just as Turandot entered for her first scene, a previously set program came on and that was the end of that recording of Turandot.  All that was left to do was purchase it.  Upon arrival I opened the DVD, trying not to use my teeth to get the wrapping off, then sat back in comfort to watch Turandot.  It was everything I could have hoped for.  My ruined recording was a Franco Zeffirelli production but all that was available was an earlier Zeffirelli production, but as a consolation prize, I got Placido Domingo.  Sublime.      As a plot line, Turandot's refusal to gracefully accept her loss and live up to her bargain made me want to somehow slap her silly face, but since one cannot do that, I tried to ignore that part of the story.  When that happens I know the author has done well.
B002R68U7K|4.0|First of all, let me let you that I find this collection a little extra as a quite satisfactory compilation, [[ASIN:B0006FO8RA Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]] was already released five years ago and Britney has released only two more albums since then. Yes, it was not such a huge collection that is incredibly delicious for the fans, nevertheless I find it unnecessary to release compilation sets so consecutively.    This box set is a real must for every Britney fan and I bought it as a birthday present to my boyfriend, who is one of those fans. His birthday is on February 2 and the first package I ordered in early January has been lost, so I had to order another one and make him wait for an extra two months, besides paying extra money for a faster shipment. I really think Amazon should keep track of its packages!    For the content, each and every single by Britney is included and considering single CDs are not sold in Turkey, being able to buy all of them at one time is amazing. My boyfriend hasn't got any of her albums yet, except the \\"[[ASIN:B002MXNOBK In the Zone/Britney]]\\" set I bought him, so suddenly he possessed all her hits besides some rarities and remixes, and of course a DVD containing nearly all the videos. The only flaw of this set is, to me, the exclusion of the videos to '[[ASIN:B000069JAY Boys]]' and '[[ASIN:B002QEIUEQ 3]]'. OK, '[[ASIN:B0002J58G0 Outrageous [Vinyl]]]' is not a complete video and its exclusion can be understood, but those who has bought \\"[[ASIN:B00064AM62 Britney Spears - Greatest Hits - My Prerogative]]\\" DVD know very well that 'Boys' have a video. For '3', if it couldn't make as it hadn't been filmed yet, they could have waited a little more, right? The single of this song is included in the end.    Apart from these, the collection is huge and worth the money for every Britney fan and also for the music collectors.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. was a very insightful look into cultivating, raising, and processing of food in the United States. This movie provides the information we need to motivate us to stop supporting the poisoning of our bodies by buying chemically treated and processed foods. At the end of the movie, I was convinced that my time had come -- I moved to the organic side of the fence (after just a couple of weeks I am already clearer and my weight is heading down).
0743435753|5.0|At this rate, I may actually finish the Honor Harrington series before the heat death of the universe. Having just finished Flag in Exile by David Weber only fifteen years late, I think I'm getting the hang of this series.<br /><br />Though a friend at work recommended the series, and due to the length, I was suspicious it would be throw-away pulp; I'm willing to admit now that that my fears were mostly unwarranted. Weber clearly enjoys the universe he constructed, and has spent significant time developing it. In Flag in Exile, Honor retires to Grayson as steadholder after losing her commission thanks in no small part to Pavel Young. This allows Weber to expound on the changes Harrington has influenced in their society as they struggle to accept her. As expected, this is much easier said than done.<br /><br />This is thanks to a number of developments that complicate the plot, again, into a snarl of politics with the added zing of religious zealotry. Poor Honor. Her new venture in Sky Domes promises to make her even more wealthy, she's been requested to act as Admiral to a squadron consisting of half a dozen super dreadnaughts and other lighter attack craft, and considering her pseudo-exile, things are progressing swimmingly. Until accounting for the concerted effort to undermine Sky Domes, assassinate her credibility through righteous manipulation of the population, outright murder to further these aims, and an oncoming attack from Haven that doesn't even allow her an hour of sleep in the interim. The final half of the book is unrelenting. Even knowing Honor would win in the end never stopped me from cringing as circumstances stacked against her.<br /><br />The thing that really affected my sensibilities however, was that Benjamin Mayhew's iron reign on the other steadholders is essentially the only thing standing between Honor and the indignant conspirators. If an accident of birth had created Mayhew more in the image of the zealots seeking to destroy her, things would have taken a disastrous turn. Weber even included an afterward describing his own concern over the blindness that sometimes overtakes men and women, so utterly convinced of their own virtues that the ends justify any means, no matter the human fallout. These crusades appear constantly in our own history, and sickeningly, Honor's struggles are hardly an exaggeration; if anything, they're nothing compared to the atrocities committed in the name of holiness.<br /><br />I wouldn't say Weber is a master of this kind of subject matter, but he definitely understands the underlying complexities inherent in a government that seeks to subjugate such intolerance. The machinations are believable and compelling despite the mundane nature plotting and scheming might otherwise suggest.

Weber even included an afterward describing his own concern over the blindness that sometimes overtakes men and women, so utterly convinced of their own virtues that the ends justify any means, no matter the human fallout. These crusades appear constantly in our own history, and sickeningly, Honor's struggles are hardly an exaggeration; if anything, they're nothing compared to the atrocities committed in the name of holiness.     I wouldn't say Weber is a master of this kind of subject matter, but he definitely understands the underlying complexities inherent in a government that seeks to subjugate such intolerance.

0307266303|5.0|As a runner of many many years, and both a NCAA competitive athlete and a semi-professional runner for years, this book is both an interesting read and educational at many levels. Who knows if all the ideas will bring about the revolution in training that they could, but it is interesting to find out, and with a story that could stand alone by itself.
0307387178|3.0|I found this book to be a very interesting and easy read.  I don't believe there was really enough information to make this an actual book.  Why the author had to use abit of \\"fodder\\" of his own personal stories to complete it.  But it was still a great story & I enjoyed the article when it was published in Outlook magazine some years back.  I saw the movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed with the exception of the ending, & that led to me wanting to know more about this young lad.  The book helped me realize what happened at the end of the movie & gave me abit more closure than the movie did.  Chris \\"Supertramp\\" was an extremely likable & adventurous young man but really was too naive to have struck out in such desolate territory all on his own.  He made some fatal mistakes that I still cannot wrap my head around as to why he did so.  He burned the last almost $200 of his money & brought only one bag of rice with him.  If he had only used that burnt money for additional bags of rice, I believe he would have survived his great Alaskan adventure.  I was shocked that he failed to bring rubber boots or even a tent of some sort.  If he hadn't stumbled onto his \\"magic\\" bus, I don't know that he could have survived the elements at that time of year without shelter of some sort.  I don't believe just a sleeping bag would have sufficed. I also was amazed at what little common sense he used at times such as not bringing a map of the area with him.  He was only 6 miles from cabins with supplied food & could have crossed that raging river very easily another way if he'd only had a map.<br /><br /> It appears Chris was an extremely likeable character & made some lasting friendships along his way.  I don't understand how he could have \\"chucked\\" his family like he did & take off to parts unknown for 3 yrs. without sending any communication to his worried family.  I also found it odd that he waited til he graduated college b/4 setting off on this adventure spree.  It made me ponder that perhaps it boiled down to the fact that Chris was just not ready for a full time j-o-b, responsibility & what encompasses the reality of \\"being an adult\\".  Or maybe it was just one last time to find himself b/4 joining the rat race of adult life.  All in all, it was a very moving book and movie.  I hated the outcome & wish those moose hunters had arrived even three weeks earlier.  What a different outcome all this would have had & Chris would still be here enjoying his life.  It was a terrible tragedy & one that easily should not have happened & could have easily been prevented.s it boiled down to the fact that Chris was just not ready for a full time j-o-b, responsibility & what encompasses the reality of \\"being an adult\\".

B002ZIABPO|5.0|Another great album from Beach House, and a great package. Vinyl, mp3 download & a DVD with music videos...what more could you ask for? Great price for all the goodies you get.
B003162R7E|4.0|This is a tasty, abundant sampler of Hendrix for those who may not have any of his music. Beautifully remastered and full of his trademark psychedelic, multilayered textures and flaming fingers, it is a great introduction to Jimi's music. It may be all one would need. Some might call his style undisciplined. It goes way beyond that. The standout track , #9, \\"Beginnings\\",is  especially endearing to me for the lack of vocals. I never considered Jimi's vocals or lyrics to be his strengths. The DVD is fascinating and enhances the overall experience--all for the very reasonable $11.99! A great value!
B0039UTDFG|2.0|Supposedly, everything Oprah touches turns to gold, right?  SOOO wrong in this case!  She's truly the worst narrator for this program.  Her sugary sweet, warm bedtime story voice does NOT match this series.. I honestly thought I was the only one feeling this way, but coming online to read the reviews made me realize I'm just one voice in a huge crowd that feels the same way.  If there's any way to get a different narrator, please do.  Even Oprah lovers have to pass on this one.. After a while, it just gets plain annoying to hear her!
B001MYIXAC|2.0|I read the book and enjoyed it, although for me there was too much emphasis on the relationships / trials & tribulations of school kids, and not enough on the lore and activities of vampires. Some creepy scenes, but not a particularly scary read for me as compared to Salem's Lot by Stephen King or They Thirst by Robert McCammon. I then rented the DVD, hoping the movie format would increase the tension and fear factors. No such luck. I found the movie so boring that I never made it all the way through. The acting was stiff, the dialogue wooden, the characters shallow with little development and no charisma, and the action tedious. In the book, the little vampire girl was described as beautiful with delicate features; in the movie she was plain with a big nose. The boy was supposed to be overweight and pale; in the movie he was pale and lean and platinum blond, like a star waiting to grow up. No innovative cinematography or sets. I do NOT like overly gory movies where all you see is slice and dice, but I do like suspense, a sense of ominous evil that you the viewer are dying to see defeated, and a set of \\"rules\\" constraining the monster that make defeat a possibility. These rules might be a vulnerability to stakes in the heart, aversion to daylight and garlic, etc. It doesn't really matter what they are, as long as they are consistent within the reality portrayed and so make the story believable. This movie only had time to portray some psychological background for the children described in the book; the vampire story is pretty scanty. Sorry I rented it.
B0030Y11O2|5.0|My anger at them and the whole bush monstrosity is raw and visceral. Mr. Moore is compassionate. His anger is elegant, eloquent. His satire is dead on. He sees insanity and calls it such. He casts a long shadow which the rest of us run to catch up.
0307463745|5.0|No \\"secret formulas\\". Nothing new. Very easy to read. So what is the importance of this book?  It's marvelous. You can read in simple words all the mistakes you did in your business.  Very disturbing but very inspiring book.  I think the illustrations were only a filler, but I copy some of them and put them in my desk as a reminder of the things I have to rethink everyday.
B00004RFFS|5.0|If you're looking for a family-friendly movie, this movie is NOT for you.  If you are looking for something that will make you think, or even if you just love movies with sexy vampires in it (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas), then this movie just might be the perfect choice!    Interview with the Vampire is a rather dark, but intensely intriguing movie about one vampire's journey through life as the odd 'man' out--he doesn't like killing humans to eat.      I've seen the film several times now and it still fascinates me how it draws you in and makes you pity not only the vampire who wishes he wasn't (Louis), but even the more callous vampire (Lestat) who seems to really be looking for a companion to share the pieces of his life with.  You will see that the line between good and evil is blurred and it skirts around topics that some might find rather taboo, but perhaps that is part of the intrigue.  The movie doesn't apologize for it's hidden themes and it weaves them into a beautifully crafted, well thought-out story that you won't soon forget.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|An excellent commedy movie. It's alway good to have a piece of good commedy in your movie collection.
B000GW8VTO|1.0|I ordered this video after skipping over the offers of used ones.  I wanted a new, quality product as it was to be shown first to my group of veteran friends.  When it arrived I attempted to review it first to see if, in fact, I did get a good product.  I found that it was on a blank CD, and that the label had been placed, (haphazardly), over a previous label of some sort.  After letting my group of friends know that Anazon had not given me what I had paid for, we found another video of the same title at a local rental store to get us through the scheduled meting, and I applied for a refund. Amazon did see that I had my expenditure refunded, and except for not being able to live up to my offer of furnishing this particular video, all came out all right.<br />  This was my first,(and last), attempt to buy through Amazon.  Lesson learned!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This is a great way to experience a McCartney concert when you couldn't be there in person. FANTASTIC!!!!
0061914177|5.0|My wife and I went to see Gary speak. His enthusiasm for this new marketing model is apparent in everything he does (podcasts, books, speaking engagements, etc). Don't let any negative feedback on Amazon deter you from experiencing this book (in any of its forms). While specifics may change (one week people are using ping, the next week they're not), overall the message shines through: follow your passion, \\"do what you do\\" and you'll be happy (Life Is Good ;-)<br /><br />Gary's message is part of a whole new movement of \\"positivity\\" and constructivism in everything from business to psychology. Focus on what your strength is (knitting to re-building carburetors) and get a blog setup. Use your blog to spread your word and get connected via online social networking services (such as facebook, twitter, youtube) and marketing services (such as, Google AdSense/AdWords or becoming an affiliate of Amazon, Audible, Netflix, iTunes, etc). Not only will your positive message begin to inform people and \\"construct\\" their new understanding of the world (and specifically your passion), but your success will be measured in cash flow. Gary conveys that if you devote a lot of time to your passion it will be apparent in what you get back (in money, love and \\"thunder\\"). With work, what you envision and dream in your mind will manifest in reality (ie your life).<br /><br />A perfect example of this new philosophy working: Yesterday I tweeted about a new product called Truvia (an all-natural/organic sugar substitute that tastes great btw) and within 24 hours they wrote me back. Not only about the product, but about my personal interests (which I made public in my Twitter profile). The company made an effort to \\"build their brand\\" by taking the time to make a personal connection with me. I felt like I had made a \\"friend,\\" not only with another person, but with a company. That simple fact changes everything! Never in history could consumers feel that connected to a brand.<br /><br />The \\"Mad Men,\\" of the past, strived for this, but could never truly reach this level of connectivity with their customers. Now with computers, online social networking and Gary's guidance (via VaynerMedia & Crush It!), this new science of marketing should be embraced because it simply works. Corporations that follow this philosophy will rise and those who are \\"stuck in the past\\" (ie Xerox, Ethan Allen, GM) will slowly fall.<br /><br />If you are interested in building your business (big or small) or the science of marketing BUY CRUSH IT! You won't regret it.<br /><br />Also, checkout books by  Eckhart Tolle, Tim Ferris, Daniel Pink, & \\"The Secret\\"
031606792X|1.0|I admit, I read the first Twilight book and though I would never consider it quality literature, it was mildly entertaining as a light read. Breaking Dawn, however, was a disaster. The whole thing seemed to be the overly ideal and naive fantasies of Ms. Meyer herself. I mean, really? Ooooh! she's a vampire! How awesome is that? Even though young ones normally have all these problems, she doesn't have to deal with them of course because she is beautiful and awesome and everyone wants to be her. Oh, and, her child grows quickly to have long, radiant hair because everything is perfect. Except the kid doesn't sparkle. Oh no! And of course Edward is perfectly fine with Bella suddenly changing her looks completely because before she didn't sparkle... unacceptable. Where are the character flaws, other than being dull? Honestly, it looks like the type of stuff I wrote in 6th grade. Very similar. Only I realized what a bunch of nonsense it was and deleted my little novelettes.
0061914177|5.0|This may not be new material, but there are a lot of people out there that need to read stuff over and over to have that \\"revelation\\" or that \\"aha moment\\" come to the surface. Gary v has a lot of intensity, passion, drive and energy and he does a great job of motivating people. He does bring up some new stuff and the stuff that's been said he says in a different way. I think it's a great, very helpful book.
B002ZFQD0Y|5.0|It's really cool; interseting to see Serj in that costume but the concert is perfcet, the songs are amazing. You can see, you can listen, you can feel everything in it. It's worth to keep in your collection.
B000000W3G|5.0|This company was amazing. They helped with everything and got it to me when I needed it. Thanks guys.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|These games are classics that are very unique. I consider it a cross between an RTS and RPG. You go through a somewhat complex story that may require some online reading to catch up with previous story about the worlds you are on. I by far love Heroes IV, Heroes III I always got frustrated with how hard it was. Both games consist of you building up castles and create armies in order to either explore and obtain artifacts or destroy your enemies. Other than intro cut scenes, the plot is textually displayed.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I thought this video was very informative and I first heard about it on the Oprah show.

B00319ECGU|5.0|I was only partially a fan of the 'Dirty Harry' movies when they come out but I bought this Blu Ray collection because it was on sale. On second viewing these are much better than I expected and the Blu Ray versions are really nice. The special features are far better than I expected and most of them were really interesting; there were a couple of BBC 'specials' I passed on after a few minutes.    As good as the movies are, the specials features on Clint Eastwood were worth the price. I'm a big fan of Eastwood and this specials on these discs were very interesting.     Whether you just like the genre and these movies or a an Eastwood fan, this collection is worth your money.

There is so much deeper meanings throughout this book that it is imperative to read this book slowly and carefully to fully absorb all the meanings.<br /><br />Highly recommended and very easy to read.  :)
B0006AAS5G|4.0|For about $100 this is a very decent watch. It looks good and keeps accurate time. It's not a Rolex, but I didn't pay for one. The chrono model was chosen because it looks cool, and frankly I haven't even made use of that feature. I'd recommend the #9211.
1449512569|5.0|G. K. Chesterton is quoted by many including C. S. Lewis and Ravi Zacharias.  This is the book that is the source of many of the quotes.  It provides the thinking of G.K. Chesterton as he transitioned from being an agnostic (or even atheist)to embracing christian orthodoxy.  He got to that point from reading the atheist writers and their objections to christianity.  He uses logic to prove that logic alone cannot solve many theological issues!  If you were placed in an asylum for being crazy, how could you prove that you were sane?
B003ELNV9Y|4.0|In a musical landscape littered with instantly consumed and tossed download singles, the art of the full length album has been almost completely lost.  Beck's fine effort deserves, maybe even commands, to be listened to in one sitting.  Having done that many times, I find myself thinking 'Is it over already?'  The music just flows from this cat's fingers.  Yes, perhaps there is a tad bit of overproduction but c'mon, let's just enjoy the darn product!  Fab stuff.
0316776963|4.0|Quality writing and quality wit.  Part memoir and part education.  The kind of book you can take you time and enjoy the ride.

B00328G4V6|1.0|Valleys O Neptune is welcome. Its always great to get more Jimi. But! Its painfully apparent why Jimi didn't release it himself. The chord-lines waffle and go nowhere. The words are un-inspiring and evoke little. The guitar solos are unfocased. Its sad really. With all the thousands of hours of live video/audio taken of Jimi what they are releasing. To qualify my opinions see, and hear; [...] Peace n Love; Tomi Lovelix

B00371QQ2U|2.0|Apollo 13 is one of my favorite movies, probably due to having grown up during the space race with the Soviet Union. I own two other copies of Apollo 13, but wanted it on Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, they're apparently putting too much stuff on Blu-Ray discs these days (BD-Live, interviews, extras, every language spoken on Earth, etc.), which makes this movie almost impossible to start.  I note that another reviewer just sent his back because he couldn't get it to work without an internet connection to his player -- while I DO have an internet connection, my guess is that if he had just waited for about ten minutes to get through all of the junk he'd probably have been able to watch the movie -- it just says that SOME features will not work without a connection.  My guess?  The thing is just massively overloaded with junk.  I timed it, and if I just let it run through all the previews, I then get to the language screen in about five minutes.  If I push enter for English, it goes back into load mode, and in another two to three minutes you get the screen where you can play the movie.<br /><br />I caution you, however:  If you push ANYTHING ELSE other than play, it may very well send you into a blank screen loading mode again.  I tried it again today, wondering if it was just something I had done wrong, but before the movie started I had begun talking to myself (never a good sign) and just took the thing out of my player, probably never to be tried again.  But who knows -- if I had just let it keep running it might have started the movie by NEXT YEAR'S anniversary of the launch of Apollo 13 (April 13, which I assume is why I got it on that day).  Perhaps they should have sent it a week earlier, and I could have had a pizza, some popcorn, party hats and have been all set to watch it when it finally fired up on the 13th.<br /><br />Once you DO get to the movie -- it's fine.  The picture quality is clear and vivid.  If getting a probably nicer copy of Apollo 13 offsets the frustration level of the extraneous stuff on the disc is really up to the individual.  Consider yourselves forewarned so that you'll know what to expect when you fire up this disc.rustration level of the extraneous stuff on the disc is really up to the individual.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love movies about animals and I think this is one of the best I've ever seen.  It is a beautiful \\"love an loyalty\\" movie. Richard Gere is superb!  The very best thing about it is that it is a true story, making it even more special.  Have the kleenex handy though!  Great movie for ALL ages.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|After skimming through most of the reviews, I am beginning to wonder why some people go to a moton picture presentation to begin with.  I look at viewing a motion picture, domestic or foreign, as an escape from reality, one professionally filmed and believable, which is the purpose of any movie.  I found Green Zone absorbing, mostly factual (after all, this is Hollywood) with great performances and an edge-of-the seat experience.  As for the political aspects of the story line, if I wanted to whine about who did what wrong in 2001 and disect all the politics and foreign policies, I would check out reference works from the library then go take a university course on foreign relations.  In my view, a must-see presentation, not for the faint of heart.  Maybe civilians wouldn't get the discipline, sacrifice, and dedication displayed in the movie, but to anyone who has served in any military service successfully, it is reminiscent of what it is to be disciplined, both as a leader and a follower, and to possibly sacrifice one's self to achieve victory.
0307463745|5.0|What's written on the cover by Seth Godin: \\"Ignore this book at your own peril\\" is more than adequate.<br /><br />This book is a marvel! Is a great way to get a first-hand insight on what to do in order to start up -and then run- it the right way.<br /><br />Much of things they say may seem obvious to some -they did to me- but, they wrote them first, and, it's great to read them and know that we can read it when needed.<br /><br />If you ever used Ruby on Rails, you already know that they are, at least, great in making simple things that do great stuff.<br /><br />And the book goes to that standard. It's super easy to read, it's divided in short 'chapters' -usually, no more than 3 pages- and, it's super addictive.<br /><br />Great work, 37Singnals! Just another great work from you!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely.  My only complaint would be the close-ups of Clint as he would begin to get mad.  It almost seemed comical, though I am sure that was not the intent.  Overall, the movie was great!
B0038KHTI0|5.0|It's hard to review this release without some bias creeping in.  You see, I greatly enjoyed both Metal Opera releases but never expected a third.  Of course, there was no Metal Opera Part 3, but there was \\"The Scarecrow.\\"  Tobias Sammet initially intended for \\"The Scarecrow\\" to be just a solo release but during the writing process found he had the makings of a new Avantasia release.  With some encouragement from producer/guitarist Sascha Paeth, Tobi wrote and recorded \\"The Scarecrow,\\" which while different in many ways from his previous works under the Avantasia banner, still contained a lot of the bombastic and over-the-top elements he is known for.    Last year I was quite surprised and delighted to hear that Tobi was crafting a sequel.  I become even more elated when I found the sequel would be two parts.  Some excellent vocalists were brought on board to carry on the Avantasia name including Russell Allen (Symphony X), Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens (ex Judas Priest, ex Iced Earth) and Klaus Meine (Scorpions).  I was already sold.    It's no surprise that I love this release.  I do not know if either is better than \\"The Scarecrow,\\" but it does not matter as both are great complements as well as stand alone records.  Both are stylistically very similar to \\"The Scarecrow\\" in that they contain a lot of power metal influences as well as hard rock and progressive elements.  For those of you that didn't care for \\"The Scarecrow,\\" you probably won't find much to like here.    Now, as for the albums, where to start?  I suppose at the beginning, with the \\"The Wicked Symphony,\\" a big Avantasia epic topping the nine minute mark.  There are a couple of epics on the set, some work better than others, but this one is the clear cut cream of the crop.  Many will likely consider this the best song in the set and with good reason.  Russell Allen is featured prominently and really shines as he seems to find a way to do so on all of the tracks he sings on.  Tobi has some lines as well, and haslines in every song but one, however he's featured less here than he is on any previous Avantasia album.  This is neither a good or bad thing really, just an observation.  A reduced role by Tobi opens the door for some others to assume the spotlight.  Jorn Lande, featured heavily on \\"The Scarecrow,\\" is plentiful here as well and does not disappoint.  Other artists get featured heavily for just a song, such as Meine on the single \\"Dying for an Angel,\\" and all really embrace the spotlight.  Perhaps none more so than Ripper Owens and Jon Oliva.  Ripper sings on \\"Scales of Justice\\" and gives a vocal chord rupturing performance.  It is easily the hardest hitting track on either album.  Oliva plays the role vacated by Alice Cooper of The Toy Master, only now he's a ghost featured on the Angel of Babylon track \\"Death is Just a Feeling.\\"  It's a very cool and atmospheric track that could only be found on a concept album.  It might be too \\"out there\\" for some, it sounds like an outtake from \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" but I personally think its one of the standout songs from either album.    Some other noteworthy tracks include the rock heavy \\"Alone I Remember\\" which has a unique performance by Lande.  \\"Your Love is Evil\\" is one of my personal favorites, a rocker with some 80's flair that most will either love or hate.  \\"Symphony of Life\\" has the distinction of being the only song to not feature Sammet and is also the only song not written by Sammet (Sascha Paeth wrote it).  Cloudy Yang makes her Avantasia debut as a lead singer and does a great job.  This appears to be a polarizing track for some fans in the early going though I find it to be a hard-hitting tune that is a nice change of pace.    With around two hours of material, there's going to be some stumbles but the ones present here are minor.  \\"Rat Race\\" from AoB is very straight-forward and underwhelming, the same can be said for \\"Down in the Dark.\\"  \\"Stargazers\\" is one of AoB's epics and it mostly delivers, though the chorus falls a bit flat in comparison with TWS and \\"Journey to Arcadia.\\"  These are minor quibbles though as even the lesser tracks still show meticulous detail and excellent production values.    If I had to pick one (and since this is a set I really don't) I would have to say The Wicked Symphony is slightly better than Angel of Babylon, which seems to be the general consensus.  TWS is a bit more straight-forward, it takes fewer chances and a lot of what's there is incredibly catchy and effective.  AoB brings some new elements to the mix, and for the most part, they work extremely well.  Its the songs that play it safe that fall a bit flat (such as the previously mentioned \\"Rat Race\\") and don't pack the same punch as other songs.    If you're springing for the deluxe edition I can whole-heartedly recommend it.  The packaging is of terrific quality.  The box is sturdy and the hardcover digi-books are definitely eye catching.  The bonus material is a bit lacking as the only worthwhile pieces are the two downloadable live tracks, \\"Twisted Mind\\" and \\"Lost in Space.\\"  Both will hopefully receive a more official release as part of a full album and DVD of live Avantasia material in the not too distant future.    At the end of the day, if you liked \\"The Scarecrow\\" you will certainly enjoy both of these albums.  \\"The Wicked Symphony\\" may have the edge over \\"Angel of Babylon\\" but both are five-star releases in my opinion.  I know I probably enjoy the rock and synth elements present on both releases more than the average power metal fan, but the production, musicianship, vocal performances, and sheer scope of these releases is of the highest quality.  You would be unwise to miss out.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|I enjoy this series tremendously. The most outstanding thing I've found, is the acting ability of Jensen Ackles. He starts out being a good actor, and then he's elevated to a great actor. If he ever gets a good script to do (Hollywood),AAA rated, watch out, he's off to the races. I don't have the t.v. channel that Supernatural comes on, so I've purchased the DVDs for each season. I'm amazed at how they've changed the concept of this program. They've turned it into an Armageddon type. I was soooo sorry to see Sam and Dean's father written out of the program. I for one, thought it always added a portion of suspense, not knowing when he'd show up to help his \\"boys\\". I guess if the scripts aren't top quality, Emmy's just ignores these types of programs. That's alright, Ackles will come into his own in due time, they probably think he's too green. At 73yrs,[[ASIN:B0013IF7L0 Awards Night Male Statuette]] I might not see it, but he'll be on the \\"red\\" carpet one day, on his was to receiving his Oscar!!
096319254X|5.0|I agree with the c. piana review.  c. piana, your review hits the nail right on the head.  Rice is Memnoch and we are Lestat as we are reading.  Like vampires we return to reading and thinking in need of our insatiable fix. Like Memnoch, Rice plays with our heads with this one.  As a Christian, I also agree,if you want spiritual nourishment, don't seek your definitive answers from this work of fiction.  She certainly gives you food for thought, though and entertains you along the way.  Worth the read whatever your worldview.
B002VECM4A|5.0|I watched this once and found it too challenging to be very moving.  I then watched the bonus features on the DVD and was surprised to see that Gabby Sidibe was *quite* different from the character of Precious.  I hadn't planned to watch it again; but the next day I took a flight to Japan and found this movie available on the plane.  I planned to skip through it, but ended up watching it again.  Somehow, for some reason, as soon as the Labelle song kicked in at the end (\\"It Took a Long Time\\"), something inside me really started to stir (though I was already stirring from Precious' final breakdown in the classroom, when she revealed to her teacher what \\"love\\" had done to her).  But when \\"For Precious girls everywhere\\" popped up on the screen, I had quite a trembling lip!!  It was embarrassing on the plane, but I just could not help it.  There was something about the second viewing that made it so incredibly moving.  It also revealed many of the nuances of the film and the many characters (for better and for worse).  But that second viewing really did it for me.  It also became clear to me that the performance of Gabby Sidibe was far more massive than the size of Precious herself.  I was astonished to view the layers and the consistency in the performance; from how she walked and talked, and used her facial expressions to reveal the inner rumblings of her semi-literate mind.  I will now declare that this is probably the biggest Oscar oversight ever (but at least they nominated her).  Even if you call it a \\"niche\\" role for this actress (and suggests a limit to her versatility), that does not matter--she was brilliant and unforgettable.  It's a shame she didn't win, because it would have been the best underdog victory ever.  But that doesn't diminish the film or her incredible embodiment of this tragic yet inspired and inspiring character.      So my advice is to watch it again if it didn't move you.

B003AOAXGE|5.0|I've been teaching kids about the score to Peter and the Wolf for many, many years. Until now it had a slightly comical edge to it. This little movie puts a wonderful new slant on the story. No longer is Peter the carefree little ratbag who gleefully catches a wolf and then blithely marches him off to the zoo. Peter is more closely related to my more interesting students - gentle, unsure of himself, frustrated with being a powerless boy and ready to make some big decisions.     The movie has its comical moments, and the animation is charming, but the brilliant way the story creates a multi-faceted tale means the music moves to an entirely different level for young viewers. They won't just understand the story, they will understand the feelings the music conveys. This brings the music not only to very young students, but to music students of any age. If you are looking for something that students can get their teeth into instead of just a one-dimensional fairy story, this is the flick for you!
B0038P59A0|5.0|Incredibly witty and believable. Finally a movie that test your intelligence. Wear headphones, turn out the lights, and don't get interrupted while watching this movie. Every word, every image is a clue that draws you in deeper into the story. Casting, fantastic. Street and harbor scenes are visually perfect,...crowded, smoky, dirty, loud. Fight scenes, superb. PLEASE, let there be many sequels to come.

I thought the Book might be a bit scary, by the Title and all, but not in the least. It didn't take him long to memorize the whole story. Also, a good message in the end.  Highly recommend 'Where The Wild Things Are'.

Gary talks from the heart and whether you agree with his methods or not the lesson is in the depth of his conviction. Gary leaves nothing on the field and makes no apologies about winning. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to take responsibility for their success. His stories are excuse removers and challenge all procrastination. Gary, well done.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I saw this movie on NetFlix and just to have it. This is one the most incredible true stories I have ever seen and it happened in New York. To everyone who has never seen this movie - WATCH IT! For mothers with young children, it is a must see movie. This movie receives my highest rating. Another great Clint Eastwood movie.

B002L3RVCY|4.0|First I am a huge fan of Star Wars. Empire Strikes Back is the best. This cartoon is not bad. My only gripe is battle droids that can't shoot straight.

It could be so much better if it was just darker and not so kiddy at time.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic are the most fun/serious/entertaining duo to come along in a long time. This tv show will keep you on the edge of your seat with drama and keep you giggling at the same time. Molly Quinn plays Castle's daughter Alexis, it is so refreshing to see a teenager be a teenager. Molly and Nathan have a connection that shows in their scenes together. They keep you laughing as Alexis is trying to \\"raise\\" her father because he is such a kid at heart. Nathan is such a versatile actor he brings life to Castle. Then you throw in Susan Sullivan as his mother? Her past rolls speak for themselves, she is and always has been an amazing actress. The supporting cast, Tony Award winning Actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Jon Huertas, Seamus Dever & Tamala Jones, make this the best crime comedy drama to watch. I would recommend season 1 along with season 2, and the book Heat Wave & Naked Heat both written by \\"Richard Castle\\" of course.
1439190275|4.0|I bought this book on the advice of my doctor.    Before beginning the diet, I read every argument about the Atkins diet I could find, and while there are many people that speculate on the potential adverse long term effects, none have been demonstrated. In fact, the only long term effects of the diet have been shown to be positive.    The book itself is easy to read, and well organized. Information on each stage is presented in a concise manner, with review points given at the end of each chapter. After first reading the chapter on Phase I, and then reading the book from cover to cover, it has remained open as a reference ever since. It is full of recipe ideas, nutritional information and helpful guidance to both lose weight and maintain your health long term.    The only criticism I have is that the research presented to support the diet was biased and unconvincing. For this reason I'm giving the book four stars rather than five.    On the other hand, satisfied with my own investigation and the encouragement of my doctor, I have chosen to eat according to the Atkins diet, and have comfortably lost 20 pounds (and still losing).

B0037QGS0A|4.0|Canadian director Atom Egoyan's newest feature is the first that he didn't also write, and at first glance looks to be far and away his most conventional and accessible film.  The fact that it's produced by Ivan Reitman, the man behind such 80s and 90s blockbusters as the GHOSTBUSTERS films and TWINS certainly wouldn't seem to contradict that notion, but appearances can be deceiving; though the film is certainly on the surface a \\"simpler\\" film than Egoyan's previous work, and does have a more focused and clear-cut narrative than most of his other films, deep at it's core it belongs very much in their company, and the more one thinks about it, the less clear and obvious it becomes.<br /><br />The film opens with a brief bit of narration by the title character (Amanda Seyfried), a high-priced escort working a wealthy area in downtown Toronto.  She describes how she makes fantasies come true by becoming in essence whatever is wanted - not just in appearance, but in personality and character.  We quickly shift to Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore), a gynecologist with an office in the same area, watching Chloe get into a car.  Stewart has a husband, David (Liam Neeson), a music professor and pretty serious flirt, and it's David's birthday and Catherine has a big surprise party planned for him.  But David is flying home from New York and misses his flight, which upsets Catherine and also sets her radar off.  A quick spy of a message left on his phone leads her to wondering if he's having an affair, and it doesn't help matters any that their teenage son Michael (Max Thieriot) is also getting more action than she is, bringing a girl home to sleep over without his mother knowing about it.<br /><br />So Catherine wants to make sure about her suspicions before confronting David, and decides to get someone to seduce him, finding Chloe at the bar in the hotel near her office.  They had earlier met in a ladies' room at an expensive restaurant, with Chloe dropping a comb for Catherine to pick up - and Chloe thinks that it's Catherine she's supposed to service at first.  Or does she?  The major element in CHLOE the film that remains mysterious and \\"Egoyanesque\\" is that we are never - even at the dramatic ending - entirely clear about Chloe the character's motivations or honesty.  She agrees to seduce David - but she then goes farther than Catherine wants.  She calls Catherine at odd times; she finds Michael and follows him; and she takes advantage of Catherine's own loneliness and isolation and eventually seduces her as well.  But what she doesn't seem to realize - and perhaps Catherine herself doesn't realize for a time - is that Chloe isn't her fantasy; her husband is - and she acts that out through Chloe as her way of being closer to the man she's estranged from.  But at this point Chloe has allowed the fantasy to take her over as well, and unlike Catherine, who eventually is able to confront David and start to understand what's really going on, she seems to have no-one, and nothing to ground her, and starts to spin far out of control.<br /><br />The critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote a short piece about this on his website - the only criticism of the film I've read - and mentioned that many other critics had, he felt, misinterpreted the film and didn't get what it is really about, which is a woman's midlife crisis.  I have to say that anybody who can't see how that is the subject of this film probably shouldn't be a professional film critic; it's obvious within the first ten minutes and remains the central issue of the film throughout.  I suppose it would be easy to call it an inversion of FATAL ATTRACTION, and certainly there are some points in common with that film and other \\"erotic thrillers\\" that tend to be about men who stray and the consequences they face; but CHLOE, apart from an ending that I thought was needlessly obvious and predestined, is much more concerned with exploring the inner reality of it's protagonist's mind - much moreinterested in getting at how the accumulation of years of work and neglect of a love life can lead to this place where one party would suspect the other, without really trying to understand either why the other might stray - or why she might think he would.  In the end it's a fine examination of suppressed emotions and sexuality that ends up concluding that men and women are not all that different when it comes to such things - not nearly as different as they think they are; and the fact that we still think we're so different is half the problem.<br /><br />The cast is terrific, with Moore proving again that she's one of the very best actresses of her generation as a wife and mother in absolute turmoil, trying to keep herself together but letting it out only very slowly and reluctantly, and Seyfried showing some real ability in the difficult role of an overly emotional cipher.  Neeson has less to do but he excels at being the chaming rogue and he's certainly convincing enough as the potential adulterer - and the wounded, wrongly accused victim (maybe).  The fancy, elegant settings, costumes and trappings of the film might seem a little overdone at first - but I think the point ultimately is that the material world means very little to anybody in the film when their hearts are wounded and their minds are racing to discover what is going wrong - and who is doing the wrong to them.  And all the money and fancy careers in the world can't prevent a heart from straying.<br /><br />The ending, as I said, seems a bit too conventional and simple to me, but on the whole Chloe is very solid work, and probably my favorite Egoyan film of the last decade or more.t how the accumulation of years of work and neglect of a love life can lead to this place where one party would suspect the other, without really trying to understand either why the other might stray - or why she might think he would.

0749953357|5.0|I've heard of Seth Godin's name mentioned in the blog community before but never really followed his blog. Unaware of his previous works (books, speech, business, etc.), prior to purchasing the book, I trusted on the significant amount of positive reviews left by readers in this site. \\"Linchpin: Are you indispensable?\\" is one of those rare books that has a nice flow of text throughout. In most cases, I struggled with not wanting to put the book down-- and that is because the book sucks you right in. The author is able to communicate his ideas very well without being dull by means of using the right set of words. I don't care how knowledgeable of a person you are, but if you can't communicate your ideas well enough, no one really cares about what you have to say.<br /><br />With the amount of knowledge that are available to us, the ideas and suggestions provided are not the very least ground-breaking. The book is rather a wake-up call, or as a reminder (or however you want to call it) to allow ourselves to finally embrace upon making the changes (that we know) we need to make in our lives. The whole idea is to explore our abilities and use it to become a more assertive and creative person. Being indispensable means creating more opportunities for ourselves, resolving inner resistance, being creative, having passion in what we do, and sharing our art to everyone around us.<br /><br />For the skeptics, the author also shares relevant stories and examples according to the topic being discussed. What makes this book entertaining is the fact that he was able to explore concepts and simultaneously introduced stories, and somewhat humor to keep it alive for me from beginning to end. I enjoyed reading the book and has made me realize things that needed and can be changed in my life for the better. Recommended.

It goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character. The cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film. This is a more serious Batman than some of the other incarntions. The action is fast and cast is great. I will enjoy this movie over and over.
0446567337|3.0|So much about this book irritated me.  To be fair, I saw the movie first and read the book wanting more.  The book took me in the opposite direction.  Why is Savannah so annoying in the novel? Who approved the Hollywood ending when the book is so different?  It is only right to say that my opinion may be colored irrevocably by the movie, which is why I gave it three stars.  Otherwise I would have given it two.

030745455X|5.0|Compared to the first book, I think parts of this book are better and some parts not as good. Overall I think its more suspenseful and has more action. There are a few holes in the story and Lisbeth taking a long vacation and spending lots of money doesn't seem to match her personality.<br />The characters certainly aren't perfect but Blomkvist and some of his reporter co-workers etc. are a little too moral and on the high ground. And of course most reporters for other magazines are scum.<br />But all in all the story has great characters. The bad guys are really bad and it makes a good story as all the pieces come together. There is also one thing in the story that I don't think most reviewers mention. Its how utterly alone and lonely Lisbeth actually is. She only hung around people who didn't meddle in her life or ask questions, but they also never got to know her very well. She just couldn't trust anyone.<br />Now we get to wait until book 3 comes out. I'll read that one slowly.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|I was sceptical when I first bought this album, as I always am with classic bands making new albums.  I really enjoyed the disc Unbreakable, and was disappointed in Humanity.  At first listen, I liked a couple of tracks, but after several listens, I really enjoy this album.  I think the production is great, and I can see them playing at least 5 or 6 songs live.  'Sting in the Tail' rocks, and I can see them using it to open their show.  3 of the 4 ballads are good, as I feel 'SLY' is the weakest track on this disc.  Just a very good disc, and Klaus' vocals are great.  He has not lost a bit.  I will definitely see them when they come to Chicago.  Thank you Scorpions!!
B002T9H2MO|4.0|I have no idea why this movie was never seen in theaters. While you have some of the more boring high-budget films out there, this one slipped through the cracks because it's an independent film, but it doesn't seem like it. Sam Rockwell does an incredible job of portraying different aspects of the character, and Kevin Spacey really puts a lot into his vocal work for Sam's only companion, a robotic assistant.<br /><br />The special effects here are top notch, but it's the story that takes center stage. There were several times when I thought I would know what was going to happen, but the story would turn from there. I honestly never saw the ending coming, and that made it much more satisfying.

045122499X|4.0|I've read just about everything by Ken Follett.  He's the best author/cinematographer on the market today.  He not only tells a story, but he paints very clear pictures like no other author comes close to.  The visuals that race through my mind is better than a movie.    I realize there are purists out there who believe this is sub-standard to Pillars of the Earth (which by the way is my all-time favorite Follett novel), but this is truly a great read.  It's captivating, relevant, has great character build up and he always, always gets his history accurate.  He knew things about the temporary Vatican in Avignon, France that not many people know about unless you've visited there and happen to know that part of history and the Catholic church.  That's why I like Ken so much.  His attention to detail is phenomenal.      Get this book and read it.  You'll love yourself for it afterwards.

B0035J6TAI|5.0|If you just looked at the song titles presented on \\"Scratch My Back\\", you might expect a medley of re-treads from songs you probably liked best in their original form. It is, in fact, a 'covers' album. But Peter Gabriel is not one to give us that kind of performance. Instead, he effectively locked the drummer and guitarist out of the studio, and bared his soul through the lyrics of some of the most memorable (and yes, forgettable) pop songs from the last 35 years or so.    With a large orchestra to support him, Gabriel gives us a recording closer to a classical collection of famous arias than it is to any arrangement of any song here you've probably heard. The difference is that Gabriel does not keep his distance. It is as if he whispers secrets in your ear. Then, tells you things about the songs you never realized. And then wailing out over the orchestra with that voice everyone knows, just to remind you it's still him. Some of these songs, like Simon's \\"Boy in the Bubble\\" are a revelation (the non-ironic version is here to display Paul's brilliant lyric work). Others are tunes I frankly could not stand in their 'original' form (I won't mention those out of courtesy), but are now receiving much attention in my CD player, thanks to his newly overhauled renditions. I'm guessing that if you don't know the words to some of these songs, you simply will not recognize them.    Peter Gabriel turned 60 this year. But he knows better than to attempt the embarrassing over-the-hill rock star routine. This is a mature work, not to be found on American pop radio, I'm sure. He has once again struck out into new territory, and he never ceases to surprise me. Don't expect to find another \\"Sledgehammer\\" here. Brace yourself for something truly personal, and involving.
B002RAREAK|3.0|I am a lover of Ushers music  and this CD missed the mark. He does express emotional/life issues but I'm not feeling his heart. With the title I expected to know him on another level, less star more human being.<br />After listening to it a few times it does get a little better. However, I notices that his lyrics are not clear. He has great vocal moments but half the time I don't know what he is saying. I feel that the music is so loud it drowns out his voice.<br /><br />I must say I really like the song Papers and when I heard it on the radio I thought this album would be like Confessions. Meaning I expected a story of love, pain tragedy etc. He might have some of that in this album but once again the beats are better than the lyrics as a whole :(.<br /><br />I say it is worth a listen but borrow it from a friend before you purchase it, because the snippets don't tell the whole story....
B001EN1R3Q|5.0|I am the biggest Motley Crue fan out there!This is without a doubt the Crues most complete work.You have the mega hits of Dr.Feelgood,Without You,S.O.S,and Kickstart my heart.Every other song on this cd is outstanding like Rattlesnake shake,and Sticky sweet.This by far is one of the greatest hard rock/metal cd's of all time hands down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So get your ass up and listen to some kick ass rocknroll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Motley Crue Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003405MF6|5.0|Intelligent creative diversity from one of the guitar masters of our times.  The orchestral pieces are simply beautiful to listen to. Jeff gives us one of his most lyrical performances.  Imelda May and Joss Stone add some great vocal performances.  Imelda May is one to watch out for.  Recently, here in St Louis she opened for Jaime Cullum and just blew away the audience with her energetic performance.  We are fortunate to have Jeff play here on April 29.    This is a great recording from Jeff that covers his many diverse styles.  Along with \\"Live at Ronnie Scott's\\" from last year, he is at the top again with some wonderful creativity.
B001EN1R2M|5.0|I am the biggest Motley Crue fan out there and this should be in the top 5 of hard rock/metal debuts of all time!!!!!!!!!You have classics like Too fast for love,Livewire,and Piece of your action.Also one of the Crue's best ballads in my opinion in On with the show!Sure it is a little raw musically,but that is what makes it a great cd.So get yourself a taste of how the ICONS started the rocknroll wheel rolling,and bang your head all night and day long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Motley Crue Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0446563048|4.0|This book is just that: an entrepreneur's autobiography.  As those go, this is a pretty awesome one, and would be a great read for anyone at any stage of either planning, starting, or growing their own company.  It's exceptionally readable in Hsieh's own voice (no ghost writer, he proudly proclaims).  And it works.  Along the way, he throws in snippets of wisdom that extend beyond his own experience: things that any entrepreneur would find useful: how best to interact with employees, how to maintain an appropriate culture within the workplace, how and when to grow a company, and more.  It's a little weak on \\"happiness\\", which is really only directly addressed in the useful but too-short last chapter (but the idea is woven throughout the book).  Anyway, the book is a good self-contained lesson in appropriate risk-taking, and the history of both Zappos and Hsieh himself.  It could probably use a bit more of a \\"how-to\\" approach rather than just serving as an example, but overall, I think just telling the story works pretty well.
0385504225|4.0|This book received less attention than The Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons, but it was just as exciting to read. A vast amount of research must go into crafting a book like this and I give Dan Brown some credit. Sure, not all of the elements of the story are his own - that many of the founding fathers were Freemasons is fairly well known - but taking facts and creating a novel around those facts is a lot of work. Just like his prior novels, once you begin reading 'The Lost Symbol' you won't be able to put it down. Of course it is no surprise that Robert Langdon again saves the world from evil, and in this case, averts a national security crisis all in the space of twelve hours, but the journey is thrilling and fun to read. I would think that this story too would make a good movie, but I'm not sure how the Freemasons would feel about such a project. Overall, this is an interesting and quick read if you're looking to pick something up and don't want to put it down until you're done.
B002TL0S46|5.0|More than just a best hits album, the collection of never before heard tracks make the entire purchase worth it...
0393075966|4.0|With Freefall, Joseph Stiglitz presents a thoroughly argued - although at times convoluted - exposé on the downfall of the global economy and (he clearly hopes) the discrediting of the \\"markets can do no wrong\\" school of economic thought.  I'm not an economist, and am not qualified to comment on the academics presented here, but the fact that no one emerges unscathed from this book gives me a degree of confidence that Mr Stiglitz has produced a well-balanced work focussed on outcomes rather than party platforms.    Many of the 1-star reviews harp on about Mr Stiglitz's wanting to give the government more power when the Fed and others were culpable in the Great Recession.  At best that interpretation does a disservice to what Mr Stiglitz advocates.  Yes, he calls for a balanced role for government involvement to keep markets in line (as, he argues, they have clearly demonstrated they cannot do it themselves), but he also takes regulators and the Fed to the mat for their poor oversight, and the Obama administration for poor choices of remedy (basically just continuing the failed policies of GW Bush).  Mr Stiglitz goes further, though, in calling for a restructuring of the financial sector - from the ashes, a phoenix - saying that today's incentives produce bad behavior, and need to be rethought with \\"right\\" outcomes in mind.  It's an admirable goal, but where the political will for this comes from is anybody's guess.  If Obama couldn't part ways with GW Bush on this matter, how will he restructure finance?  One reviewer laments the lack of moral outrage expressed by the author - did he read the book?  It's full of moral outrage and condemnation of a system which has failed everyone except the heads of the financial sector.    I agree with a few thoughts from the 1-star reviews:  Freefall tends to wander from topic to topic, and gets very repetitious. The final chapter is like reading a sermon - demanding we be, perhaps, unrealistically moral.  Also, 1-star reviewersunfairly complain there are no remedies shared in the book - there are plenty (e.g., implementing a Global Reserve Currency at one end of \\"the possible\\" and Reinventing Economics at the other), but they are a) thinly distributed throughout the book (so easy to forget they're there), and b) sometimes so grand in scope and vision as to be almost meaningless in today's political reality.    At the end of the day, I found Freefall to be harshly (yet fairly) illuminating in the origins of the Great Recession, the shortcomings of the system and its actors in the market and in the government, and the fact that something good can emerge from this mess.  It is clear that major changes are needed, and equally clear that there is good reason to be skeptical that necessary change is achievable.  We live in a different, more interconnected global economy than when the current rules were created; Mr Stiglitz convincingly argues that a new way of managing this economy - even a new way for how we think about the economy - is mandatory.  How we get from here to there, however, is anything but clear.
B00005LK95|4.0|Johnny 5 is a great character, but the sequel didn't measure up to the original as far as support charachters.
B00005MP58|1.0|I ordered Pride&Prejudice DVD. The faces were white and the colors looked faded. I returned and requested a replacement.  Unfortunately the replacement was the same and I returned.    I took out a copy from the library and the same condition exists.  I have concluded that the company that converted Pride&Prejudice from VHS did not have the expertise to accomplish a TRUE copy.    I have always had excellent service and do not fault for this purchase.  Obviously it is the fault of the distributor.
0393072231|5.0|Incredible, vivid tale of what happened to our economy.  It makes one wonder why so many of these greedy people are still making money and aren't in jail.  It also shows the cosciousness of those who knew what was happening, bet against it and then felt sorrowful because of what it did to so many unfortunate people who were taken in.      The only criticism is it would have been nice if the author had included a glossary for us financial neophytes.    Well spun tale.
B00361HV02|5.0|If you love BRMC, you're gonna love this album; - Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B002IRYYE6|5.0|If you're even considering the gold disc, there's probably no reason to talk about how great the music on the Pretenders' first album is.  I haven't heard it in a few years, and it rocks harder than I remembered.    There's been a lot of discussion about the compression on this disc.  Yes, it's misleading if there is compression/clipping if they say there is not, but if you can get over that, this disc sounds great - definitely better than any other CD version.  Haven't compared the vinyl side-by-side yet, so I can't say how they compare.  I don't have a super-high-end system, but I do love my vinyl and I think I have a decent ear for CD quality.  Sounds great to me.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|What an incredibly creative album by Merchant. Listening to 'Leave Your Sleep' feels like leaving the real world behind, like opening the first page of a fairy tale and taking the fantastical plunge to \\"Once upon a time\\"... It is a revisit to the land of my childhood.<br /><br />Suggested reading while listening:<br />Brothers Grimm Fairytales, perfectly captures the sometimes dark and somber undertones in Merchant's 'Man in the Wilderness' or 'If No One Ever Marries Me' while still capable of capturing the whimsical and exceptionally comical sounds of 'Isabel's Adventures' and 'Calico Pie'.

B000002KOJ|4.0|Frankly, I bought this because I would have had to pay for shipping if I didn't. It was cheap enough and took my purchase high enough to qualify for free shipping. I like \\"Chelsea Morning\\" and \\"Both Sides Now\\" and the other 8 tracks are probably popular with big Joni Mitchell fans.........but I am not one of them. I am giving it 4 stars because it would not be fair to Joni to give it less just because I am not a fan.
B00026ZG10|5.0|This is one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies made since terminator and terminator 2. this is a great movie. it has a good story and great action. what else can you ask for in a Arnold movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B002VECM72|5.0|This is a feel good movie that really delivers.  Sandra Bullock well deserved the Oscar for this one.  Based on a true story the director focuses in on the soft side of a young man who has been tossed around all of his life.  He finally is found by a family that learns to love him and wants the best for him.  Born with natural athletic ability and the determination to succeed Michael Oher is pointed in the right direction and is still playing footbal for the Ravens today.  Great movie.
1416575464|5.0|This book is incredible. Really comprehensive, beginning with a fabulous gameplan for starting your decoration or redecoration process. I particularly appreciate the room made for those of us with smaller budgets (especially the save/splurge encouragement). And being that I'm just learning how to describe my style, I loved the authors titles of each room, as well as the mix and match ideas. Finally, a lot of the designs are timeless, lending this book to a long and happy shelf life.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I only started watching Supernatural a couple of months ago.  A friend loaned me her DVDs.  After I watched all four seasons, I decided I had to have them.  My one regret at not watching them sooner is, I missed the opening of the season 5 show.  I love this show, and it is so funny, I never had any desire to watch it in the beginning.  I started buying the DVDs whenever I could catch them on sale.  I now have seaone 1 and 4.  When the others go on sale I will buy them too. Great show, great show.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|ARRIVED PROMPTLY. GOOD CONDITION. VERY WELL MADE. HOLDS VOYAGER VERY WELL WITH EASY ACCESS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CASE FOR PEOPLE WITH THE VOYAGER PRO. WOULD DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN.
B000ROALCG|5.0|The music is absolutely fabulous! Marc Anthony has great energy, and is a fabulous singer. The music of Hector Lavoe is exceptional, and so is his band. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes good music to dance to, or just plain quality musicianship. I could have done without the last track by Jennifer Lopez. Her voice is fine, but the song is a bit sappy and commercial for my taste -- especially in relation to the rest of the album.
B000ELJBAK|4.0|Anyone who takes delight in the singular guitar stylings heard in post-Barrett Pink Floyd, and wishes to eschew the group's heavy lyrical angst, will certainly enjoy David Gilmour's initial solo foray from 1978, the year following PF's Animals.  Right off in the initial cut, a simple extended instrumental titled \\"Mihalis\\", are heard those marvelous, dream-laden chords put to a simple beat before branching out into a diverse working of Gilmour's signature guitar sound.  The following tune, \\"There's No Way Out of Here\\", received some extensive radio airplay in certain quarters -- it's certainly a decent enough tune in the Floyd mold replete with female choral backing. \\"Cry from the Street\\" develops as a fairly mundane blues, also in the Floyd mold, before jumping headlong into a tasty coda.  \\"So Far Away\\" is a soaring ballad.  In \\"Short and Sweet\\", an otherwise unexceptional tune, are first heard those familiar chords so memorably proffered a year later in the refrain of PF's \\"Run Like Hell\\" from The Wall.  \\"Raise My Rent\\" is another dreamy instrumental blues styling.   \\"No Way\\" is often taken as a statement on the state of Pink Floyd at the time -- I wouldn't know, but it again attaches a dreamy blues and Gilmour's soft-core voice to a Floydian arrangement.  In \\"Deafinitely\\", Gilmour goes techno in an instrumental dialogue between his guitar and a howling synth.  \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\" begins as a beautiful ballad before the guitar takes flight in bringing the album to a satisfying close.  The remastered sound is most exemplary.    Know that Gilmour's first two solo albums are now available in a somewhat economical 2-for-1 package:  [[ASIN:B001FBSM4Y X2:(David Gilmour/ About Face)]]
B0031S4K5E|5.0|Not as good as Spirited Away, but great movie.  The plush Ponyo was good quality.
B000ELJBAA|4.0|About Face from 1984, co-produced by Bob Ezrin, gives us much more elaborate arrangements and diverse stylings than Gilmour's eponymous first solo outing.  The opener \\"Until We Sleep\\", a fan favorite on tour, is also a personal favorite along with the funky brass-infused \\"Blue Light\\".  \\"Murder\\" begins as a poignant, movingly sung ballad before exploding into a vocal and guitar workout.  \\"Love on the Air\\" and \\"Out of the Blue\\" are mostly delightful tunes. Gilmour grabs Pete Townshend's lyric in \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" and gives us a powerfully compact, straight-ahead rocker that displays an edge in his voice rarely heard.  Elsewhere, the tunes are mostly variable and the lyrics often inscrutable.  The closing tunes, two ballads, are disappointingly innocuous.  However, despite some bombast and indulgence, good musical taste often prevails throughout the album.  The remastered sound from Columbia is excellent, more vivid than my LP of this album.     Know that Gilmour's first two solo albums are now paired in a somewhat economical 2-for-1 package:  [[ASIN:B001FBSM4Y X2:(David Gilmour/ About Face)]]
B00005AWMF|5.0|I have never been a \\"fan\\" of Sade - just liked a few tracks here and there, but after working in a radio station with a couple of friends who were Sade fans - I came to appreciate her music a lot more.  I currently work shifts with quick turns so there are times that I have to rest even though my body isnt ready to because I have to be back work within 8 hrs and if I have the house to myself I like a little bedside music to listen to - helps me relax and rest easier than if I just try to go straight to sleep.  I find Sade a very soothing and comforting artist to listen to and since I had the album its one of the regular albums that I use in this instance.    Its also great with a jug of pimms and a good book for a relaxing afternoon.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|Was listening to the radio one morning and heard the Need You Now track.  And heard it a couple more times after and then one day caught myself singing along to the chorus in the car, so decided to check out the album on Amazon.  Fortunately Amazon had samples of the whole album available and found I liked them all so got the album and it is fantastic - even my boyfriend likes it...
B002N8A14M|4.0|I was trying to find a case that would protect my iPod as much as possible, give me access to all of the important buttons/features, and be able to clip on without being bulky.  I tried many options online, but they all left the screen exposed - exactly what I didn't want!  After visiting Best Buy and way too much online hunting, this is THE only case that met my aforementioned needs.  I went and look at it in Best Buy before I bought it - it cost $30 there.  The price on Amazon was great, but the shipping was a lot, so I only ended up saving about $10.    Good luck!
B002T45VX6|4.0|I am particial to Latin influenced music, and I have all Shakira's 'english' albums.  I love the way she explores different aspects like mixing in oriental/indian/etc influences with pop/club beat and her latin style.    This album is no different to Laundry service or Oral Fixation - although it has more in common with Oral Fixation.  I think the remixes towards the end of the CD are absolutely fantastic - especially Did It Again and Gypsy.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Buble continues to produce unique, enjoyable music. He is a cross between Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Peggy Lee and Michael Buble.  Of course he is Michael Buble.  This album both classic and modern and always fun. Buy it and sit back and enjoy or get up and dance.
B0039OGGVQ|2.0|I totally was blown away and ROCKED to GNR in high school! I don't listen to them anymore except A.F.D now and again (I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it so a little got more and more - they were dangerous!), but I do regularly listen to other bands that rock like...hmmmmm Rage against the Machine, Soundgarden (early and late), Foo Fighters, the Who (classic rock, but nonetheless ROCK), Rush, Monster Magnet, The White Stripes and Metallica, etc. There are moments on this album that shine, but for me it doesn't go beyond moments where I think, \\"oh yeah, that's cool, push it further, keep that going.\\" but the moment ends and then the rest of the song comes back to bring me back to earth and remind me of rock that I've heard before. Most of it is pretty standard run of the mill highly polished re-treaded stuff. The lyrics are not of great import. One of the reviews said that Fergie can rock, she can but it's boring. Most of it is boring. I didn't feel I could bang my head with any sincerity to any of these songs. I listened to all the songs straight through. If you've NEVER heard any of the other material put out by Slash and the other \\"friends\\" respective bands, then this might get you right where it counts, but I'm pretty deep into the fact that in general rock is dead or at the most - boring. I predict, this album will not last long in the minds of the average consumer. This seems more like it's only for Slash fans. I also understand that there are different performers on the album, but there wasn't much effort to make it cohesive. The album seems more like a grab bag. i.e. this is how Slash would sound if he played with Motorhead, or if he played with the Foo Fighters, or if he played with Ozzy...duh - that's what he's doing! BUT the songs don't fit together, there's no thread connecting the songs on the album except Slash and he's TECHNICALLY SOUND! He's a real technician, BUT the soul of his playing seems to be clouded by a great way to cash in on big names and his own solid technical skills. And Chris Cornell these days? Ack! don't get me started. Great voice, boring use of it.<br /><br />My recommendation? Skip this and get Death Magnetic - Metallica. Vulgar Display of Power - Pantera, Van Halen - Van Halen (their first), 10,000 Days - Tool, The Clash - London Calling, Guns n Roses - Appetite for Destruction (LOL!), etc. I tried to stay with current rock/metal albums, but I couldn't. Listen to Van Halen's first album it's got staying power! I'm getting tangential so I'll quit. p.s. I'm not a hard rock hater so be kind. I LOVE rock, so if something comes along that honors that spirit, I'll shout it to the mountains, but if it hypes and then comes flaccid, I'll call it out, too.ig names and his own solid technical skills.

0307408833|2.0|I wanted to LOVE this book. I am a vegan and a trained chef. I have been making vegan desserts for a few years and was excited to try the recipes in this book. As much as I hate to say this, the cupcakes AND frosting were barely palatable. I used one of the wheat free sugar free recipes and overall it was a bomb. My kids would not eat anything past a first taste, and I struggled to like what I was eating. We are all used to vegan cakes because as I said I cook/bake that way all the time. I use agave regularly as well, but it didn't make the cut here at all. There are notes in the book that say one has to try these recipes a few times to be successful and I am wondering if that is because the tastes are so far away from classic dessert tastes they are  \\"acquired\\" tastes. When making desserts acquired tastes can't be considered because you get ONE chance to wow people...my cupcakes looked great...which made the taste all the more of a let down. Sorry babycakes...
0606172971|5.0|One of many feelings this book will give you is guilt. Frank McCourt is just one of millions who lived in horrible poverty in ireland in the 20s. From the drunk father to the strict religion, Frank McCourt deals with the stereotypes of a irishmen times 10. He lives in terrible poverty in a very wet, dieseased, dirty Ireland, and loses siblings left and right. This book will dry up every ounce of water in your body and make you laugh terribly hard at the same time. The sorrow Frank McCourt goes through is unimaginable, but still seems to include humor into his book. The sing songy way of writing and the run on sentences have a poetic way about them. Reading Frank McCourt working his way to getting to America with all of his struggles and setbacks really make an impression on a reader. The book is a great overwhelming combonation of happiness as sadness with near perfection. Imagining such a lifehood is like a fantasy. -TGS
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I have been into Chris Cornell since I heard him singing Black Hole Sun. This is a different kind of album. I must admit not all the songs are great but those that are, are fantastic. Whether you are into Timbaland or Alternative Rock I think you would enjoy this album. Again it has gotten mixed reviews but I think it is because Chris is singing something out of the \\"ordinary\\" of what we expect him to sing.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|This movie is filled with the most obvious cliches and stereotypes anyone can come up. Except for the disaster and destruction scenes (which are neat I must admit), I was cringing after nearly every frame. I dont know how anyone of these producers in Hollywood thought that in their professional, somewhat artist driven opinion, this script with its cheesy, trite dialogs and shallow, two dimensional characters was worth financing. It is one of those movies you know Hollywood studios took on for the profits at the box office only and not because of the quality of the story line and acting ability of the performers. Most of the movie is CGI and the rest is pretty much a long sequence of one trite line uttered after another. It's a great popcorn movie if you just want to spend an evening with mindless entertainment, but if you expect something plausible and with quality, skip this one.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I liked the story; it was based on a true story.  I would like to have seen it in its original true context in Japanese with subtitles instead of a Japaneze dog in an American country.

0743455967|3.0|Some thirty years ago, as a young English professor, I observed that Stephen King was our era's Dickens. Hooo boy. But let's say it again, to brush the cobwebs off our beloved literary relics. There's a dissertation waiting to be written (or lolling from a shelf in the LoC) comparing King to Dickens. King is not a great writer, but he is far better, or certainly was in his prime, than he gets credit for.  On Writing attempts to explain why and how he is a good writer. Hence the memoir element and the craft element.<br /><br />He doesn't have any new \\"magic feathers\\" (as he loves to put it) for aspiring writers, just the same unwelcome news that you have to work, and work hard, and enjoy the work. That eliminates most of the folks on the long side of Sturgeon's Law. (As king puts it grimly, you can't make a good writer out of a bad one, or a great one out of a good one, but you can improve.)<br /><br />What he has to offer is a fresh, entertaining voice affirming what most serious writers would have told you, if they took the question seriously. And a refreshing \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" view of the posturing that passes for literary skill. We are welcome to sit in awe of Joyce, but let's not take too seriously his spending an entire day selecting \\"seven words,\\" ok? No wonder Ulysses took twenty years to write. Writers write, aesthetes imagine writing. King is a writer. If you want to be one, you'll have a better chance of making a living if you write.<br /><br />This isn't a great book on the writer's craft. I'm not sure there are any; it's a bit like expecting Michelangelo or Houdon to explain sculpture. They don't explain sculpture because they are busy doing it. What King has to tell you boils down to what John Gardner had to tell you, and both of them had the good sense to remind us that being told what to do will never replace doing it.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|This book got a little slow about 2/3 of the way through, however it was a satisfying read in the end.  I frequently lost track of the time frame and the characters but the story always brought you back around.
141694737X|5.0|My 18-month-old is a bookworm, and this book has been among his favorites since he was about 6 months.  It was wonderful to see him going from having to be reminded to open the flaps to anticipating the arrival of the snake-in-a-basket page with a flurry of squeals.  Buy it!!
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Esther (the astonishing Isabelle Fuhrman) comes into the lives of her new, adoptive parents (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard). Esther is a lovely, brilliant girl w/ great artistic talent. Her new family, including a brother and sister, takes her into their home. They all live happily ever after. Um, no! You see, Esther isn't exactly a normal little girl. She is much more. Esther is a nightmare unleashed on these unsuspecting folks! She is... Different. ORPHAN is a tremendous thriller w/ a knock-you-dead twisty finale that absolutely satisfies! If someone tries to give this ending away before you see the movie, hit them in their big mouth! Buy immediately!...      P.S.- I prefer the darker, much creepier alternate ending, but I'm a pretty creepy person!...
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Avatar was a good movie. I was going to buy this blu ray until I found out it was basic.  PEOPLE... come on, the only way to stop this tactic of them releasing a featureless version first and having to wait for later extended editions is to NOT BUY THE BASIC VERSION.  Do NOT buy it... rate it low... whatever it takes... this practice is wrong and they clearly do it knowing that a percentage of the potential buyers and fans will not be able to wait and will end up buying multiple copies of the same movie.  It is relatively unethical.  Clearly they can do it, but if enough vote with their wallet (by not opening it) this type of policy will have to change.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I'm going to be short and not long winded with my review of one of Sandra Bullock's (James) best film I've ever seen.  This movie came from a true story and Sandra I think played the part of her life as Leigh Anne Tuohy.  Her box office on this film should tell it all, well over $200 million and still going.  She has even done better than Julia Roberts,and other great female actors, enough said.    I will say, you should see this film, it will touch you heart.  Way to go Sandra.

0810994739|4.0|This book would not be my favorite choice of reading materials.  But children love to read funny books like this. Most children can identify with these events in this book because they have endured similiar situations at home, maybe not as bad as this book tells about, but some older sibling who tells them what to do. Children want to read about things that could happen to them and identify with stories that tell about having older siblings who seem to pick on them from time to time.    If you have a struggling reader or a reluctant reader, I recommend this book to them. After all, this is a book that will encourage reading.  Reading skills are developed by reading.  This book has pictures and fewer words on the pages than a chapter book without pictures.  So it's a good place to start, then as reading skills build, the student can move on to harder texts. Students must be engaged in reading to become a better reader.  This book is probably also a good stress reliever for children who feel stressed at school. This is one of the most checked out books in our media center at school.    Brenda Jones (author of \\"Standing up\\" and \\"No,I Don't Want to Play Today\\"[[ASIN:1608136248 Standing Up]]

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout dvd!  It is definitely tough, but it is only about 25 minutes (including the warm-up and cool-down) so it is easy to stick with it even if you have a busy schedule!  All you need are some hand weights and thirty minutes of your time...and you will see HUGE results very shortly! I have only been using it for a week and a half, and my legs are noticeably thinner and more toned, and my stomach/abs are getting tighter! I've already lost weight as well! The different levels (1, 2, and 3) provide a nice challenge once you've completed a level and feel that you are ready to move on.      Also, many people have complaints about the annoying intro that you can't skip (and I had complaints, too!), but when my dvd player broke, I had to watch the dvd on my laptop...Anyways, once you eject the disk from your computer or laptop, and you stick it in again, it will ask you \\"Play DVD from beginning? or Play from last played?\\" If you select \\"Play from last played\\" it takes you straight to the Level 1, 2, and 3 workout menu. (I know this may be a very obvious and dumb fact that I'm stating...but I just wanted to mention it in case anyone didn't know! haha) I now use the disk on my laptop always, because I can skip straight to the workout, plus I can workout wherever since it's portable.
B001S86J0I|5.0|I wonder whether a non-Trekker would enjoy this movie as much as we Star Trek fans do.  The answer is, probably not quite so much or in quite the same way, but I'm pretty sure they'd like it.  That's part of what makes \\"Galaxy Quest\\" so special.  Who needs a movie that only works for those who dress like a Starfleet officer to walk the dog?  We'd like a decent plot and some interesting characters, too, if you don't mind.<br /><br />We'll get to the Star Trek references in a second - first, a little plot summary.  \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is about the cast of a familiar-looking television show, some 25 years after its cancellation.  Their careers stalled long ago, and they make a living by opening shopping malls and appearing at conventions, where obsessed fans dress like them and ask them highly technical questions about spaceships that never existed.  Among those fans is a group of genuine aliens who have based their entire culture on tapes of the old show, which they assume are historical documents - these beings barely even know what falsehood is, let alone know it when they see it.  In any case, they are in desperate need of help; an interstellar tyrant has nearly wiped them out and they believe that the \\"Galaxy Quest\\" heroes can defeat him.  It takes the actors a while to realize that they're in a real space adventure, and it takes the aliens rather longer to realize what they've let themselves in for.  At which point everyone's a little too busy not dying to say \\"Uh-oh\\".<br /><br />This movie gets it all right.  Instead of a bunch of cookie-cutter heroes, for instance, we get a group of highly distinct personalities.  The original captain is an egomaniac who can't believe his luck, the original first officer is a trained Shakespearian who bitterly resents having to keep that ridiculous makeup on, and the original communications officer is delighted to find that she has something to do besides looking sexy and repeating whatever the computer says.  The original helmsman, who was a child during the show's original run, is grown up and angry and terrified at the prospect of driving a real ship, the original engineer is calm enough to take the whole business in stride, and there's even an extra from the original program along for the ride who's just \\"jazzed to be on the show again\\" (although he grows a bit concerned about the likelihood that he'll die in this particular episode).<br /><br />Meanwhile, the aliens are a bunch of sweethearts.  They wear electronic devices that allow them to appear human (in their true form they look like psychedelic octopi, sort of) and they have the craziest imitation of human laughter you've ever heard.  They will do anything for their heroes, up to and including preparing a dish of live bugs for the supposedly non-human first officer's dinner.  As for their nemesis - well, we're told that any adventure story depends for excitement on its villain, and this guy is hideous, perfectly vicious, and extremely hard to get rid of.  Nice combination.<br /><br />Many of the performances here have the sort of fizz you get when serious actors have an enormous amount of fun.  Some of these folks, such as Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub, have a comic background in clubs and on television, but they are quite capable of dramatic work.  Like Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver (it's nice to see Ripley from \\"Alien\\" having a nice time for a change), they sensibly submit intensely dramatic performances - none of this deadly winking at the audience just to let us know that they know it's funny.  That's the kiss of death, and it's nowhere in evidence here.<br /><br />And while I'm on the subject, will someone please make Sam Rockwell a star already?  He's wonderful at comedy here and elsewhere, his Shakespeare in \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" was a revelation, and he made a horrifying villain of his own in \\"The Green Mile\\"  The guy can do anything.  A word to the wise.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" makes a wonderful movie on its own terms.  For us Trekkers, no kidding folks, it's just about perfect.<br /><br />For one thing, these characters relate to each other according to Star Trek gossip - everyone resents the captain's hogging the spotlight, the guy with the prosthetic makeup feels pretty ambiguous about it, and then there's that young fan who won't admit it but is certain the whole thing is real.  He turns out to be right, of course, and his reaction when he learns this is priceless.<br /><br />The show itself picks up a few in-jokes from Star Trek, like the way the characters fall uphill during space battles and the spacey scientific details that make no sense when you think about them, not to mention the fact that the captain always finds some way to show off his torso.  Fandom is presented properly, too - not only the obsessed fans themselves, but the constant availability of T-shirts and other souvenirs at conventions.<br /><br />And finally, there's enough emotional punch to this movie to ensure that it's more than just a novelty act.  It comes through primarily in the underlying affection between the cast members, for all their bickering, and the way that affection transfers to the aliens, particularly when the actors wonder if they will really be able to help out.  In other words, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is the story of a group of people accustomed to thinking of their lives as wasted, who learn to take themselves and others seriously again.  Like many comedies, this one is really just a mushpot at its core, and the perfection of its attitude toward the old television show gets all the sentimentality down smooth and easy.<br /><br />Trust me, guys, you know enough about Star Trek and its environment to enjoy \\"Galaxy Quest\\", whether James Kirk is your captain or not.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, You get to poke fun at what you love.ing folks, it's just about perfect.

0071636080|5.0|Carmine Gallo does an exceptional job of organizing the book into a style that is easy to follow and comprehend.  The presentation skills of Steve Jobs are not in question in my mind so no big insight there.  However, the well thought out analysis, complete with interesting anecdotes from Jobs/Apple history, made the book a pleasure to read, as well as a helpful template for improving my own presentation style.  I believe my skills, and my confidence in my skills, had improved by the time I was halfway through the book.  I actually used an upcoming presentation as a case study while I was learning.  Fun and practical...    Gallo uses a comprehensive playbook of suggestions to give you the same coaching he offers successful CEOs and entrepreneurs, but you can easily make the style your own by taking some of this, and less of that, mixed with your own experience and personality...  He presents the breakdown, and let's you make the style your own.  A great investment!
B00026WU82|5.0|This CD is one of my all-time favorites EVER! Bob Dylan is so talented and his lyrics are amazing. In my opinion this is Bob Dylan's best album...well \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" was one of his best too. If your a big music person this is a must have. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is considered to be \\"the greatest song of all time\\" by Rolling Stone Magazine and this album is also considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. every song on this CD is great and Bob Dylan's style is so original. This album is defintley worth purchasing. I listen to it just about everyday and I love it. Bob Dylan is simply amazing and anyone who truly considers him or herself to be a huge music fan should own this CD.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I understand that some people want extras, I don't. I just want the theatrical release. It's cheaper and contains just the film I watched in the theater. I love it.
1573300403|5.0|This DVD is one of my favorite Michael Jackson possesions. His music videos are amazing and this even includes his famous \\"Motown 25\\" performance and his performance at the 1995 MTV VMA's which is amazing. Michael's music videos is what made really get into Michael Jackson. He redefines the music video and truly his videos aren't music videos they are short films. In addition to HIStory on film vol.1 this is a MUST HAVE for all MJ fans. I watch this DVD quite a bit and it really never gets old. Not only do you get his classics like Thriller, Beat It, and Smooth Criminal; but you also get some of his newer music videos which, in my opinion, I think were totally uinderestimated. His video \\"Scream\\" with sister Janet Jackson is fantastic along with \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" and \\"Earth Song.\\" I watch this DVD more than vol.1 and if you have vol. 1 you definitley need this DVD. Vol. 1 is great but it doesn't have \\"Smooth Criminal\\" which is defintley one of MJ's greatest short films and you also don't get the \\"Motown 25\\" performance which is classic. Also, I think that Michael's performance at the 1995 VMA's is one of his best dancing wise...he lip syncs due to larengitis but who cares? His dance moves are unexplainable. You also get the video \\"Liberian Girl\\" which isn't one of his best but it's different and funny. The only thing with these HIStory on film DVDs is that you still don't get some of his greatest work such as \\"Dirty Diana,\\" \\"Man in the Mirror,\\" \\"You Rock my World,\\" \\"In the Closet,\\" \\"Jam,\\" and so on. So if you like those videos too I would also look into buying \\"Dangerous Short Films,\\" \\"The One,\\" and \\"Number Ones on DVD.\\" But anyways all Michael fans would love love love this DVD and it's worth your money.
B000058983|5.0|1967 was the year of some very influential releases, for example The Beatles' Sargent Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Moody Blues' Days Of Future Passed.  To those and other landmark albums I recommend you add Love's Forever Changes.  Originally 11 tracks, this remaster contains another 7 and they really take it on to another level.  Like The Beatles and The Moody Blues offerings it presents as much more than individual songs, although to get into the mind of Arthur Lee and asertain where is coming from is another matter!  The musicanship is top class on just about everything, but special mention for Alone Again Or, Andmoreagain and You Set The Scene.  Of the bonus songs there are 2 versions of Your Mind And We Belong Together, the first are tracking sessions highlights with Arthur impossible to satisfy.  The second shows that Arthur was right to insist on the highest possible standards, it's a belter!  Give it a try whatever type of music you prefer !
0307716988|5.0|Seriously is there anything Michael Jackson can't do? His writing ability to me is amazing. His stories just flow from one to the next and you can just hear his voice while your reading. If your a big Michael Jackson fan than there probably won't be much that you didn't already know in the book but I thought it was still cool to read it from Michael's own words. Also every book is signed by Michael and includes a picture that he drew of himself which I thought was pretty cool. This book tells Michael's life in his own words and he shares with you his true emotions. He tells you of how it felt when \\"Thriller\\" became the greatest selling album of all time and of his famous \\"Motown 25\\" performance when he first did the moonwalk. This book is great and I think that every Michael Jackson fan should have their own copy. Michael also talks about his love life and you can really feel his emotions when reading it. So if anyone is interested in the life of Michael Jackson I would purchase this book. It was published in 1988 so you don't get his whole life story but the book is still fantastic. I will cherish my copy of this book forever. The re-published 2009 edition is cool becuase there is a new intro. by Berry Gordy and he talks about his respect for Michael and how he was the greatest entertainer ever. Gordy's intro. is great and it gives me goosebumps when I read it.

B002N1AERI|4.0|I love symphonic metal but never was a big fan of Epica. I picked up this album because it was on sale and the physics lyric theme seemed interesting. I was surprised that it was actually pretty good. The album however has a strongly liberal message. I laughed out loud hearing the recording of Bush and Obama.     There are a few really awsome songs on here. The rest to me are filler. I thought the guitar work was much better than any earlier Epica album (I guess they got a new guitarist). I liked the death metal elements and the fast parts I thought they combined the heavy and soft really well despite that I normally don't like it and also I see a lot of reviewers here didn't like the grunting.     I don't really understand all the great 5 star reviews. I guess compared to Epica's earlier work this is an amazing album. Far better than anything they've done before. Objectively speaking though it has a few amazing tracks then the rest are typical lame cliche songs they always do.     They have one that is like 15 minutes long and the whole thing is pretty awsome. Semblance of liberty was awsome, then design your universe was awsome. That is basically the 3 hit songs they have on the album then a few were okay and then the rest were actually lame and I never listened to them again. Though the good songs on here I come back to time and time again they are very catchy.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|You should know upfront, this is not a love story.    Telling actually the story of Tom, (500) Days of Summer stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and Zooey Deschanel as Summer. Upon meeting Summer, Tom comes to the conclusion that Summer is the one for him who will make him happy for the rest of his life. Spanning 500 days, the film shows the progress of the relationship between Tom and Summer in a non-chronological order accompanied with beautiful scenery and music.     (500) Days of Summer is one movie that should be watched by everyone, it is perfect. Also, the DVD includes amazing deleted scenes and a really enjoyable commentary by the movie's writers, director and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Don't miss (500) Days of Summer.
B00136Q342|5.0|My dad had this album on record waaaaaaay back.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|I'm not the type to get hooked by a TV series, but I was hooked by the pilot.  I immediately liked Olivia played by Anna Torv. She is not your usual FBI agent; tough as nails, hides her fears well, but you can tell she is a real woman.  She wasn't afraid to ask the tough questions or go after what she wanted to get the job done.    On top of this; is the loss of her lover and a new assignment dealing with strange technology and the possibility that she might be losing her mind because she is seeing her dead lover in the strangest of places.  To get the job done,  she is working with a Doctor (Walter Bishop) that is fresh out of an insane asylum, and a son (Peter Bishop) who doesn't like his father, and now must baby-sit him so she can use him to help her figure out what the hell is going on with the strange cases she is up against.  Sound complicated? You bet! Make me want to watch? Got me glued to the TV every week and pissed when it goes on hiatus because of scheduling and I have to wait for a month or more for it to come back on! I don't have TIVO, but I do have a system that I can save each episode to disk; when they are on hiatus, I watch them during that time and when Season 2 comes out I'll be buying the package set.    If you haven't watched the series yet, I highly recommend buying season 1.  It is a well thought out series that makes you think, fires the imagination, with  likable characters, and a few surprises.  P.S. Throw in a Cow and a Labratory at Harvard ;)

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I started watching vampire diaries out of curiosity of what the show could offer...and i never looked back!! From the 1st episode, the show will reel you in and keep you transfixed to the screen. I thought the shows' main strength comes from the love/hate relationship between the two vampire brothers, who have been at war with each other for the past century. The complex relationship of siblings will make you reflect back on your own relationships.     The writers of the show are definitely creative. Although the show is based on a novel series, I think they've managed to improve the storyline and the carefully scripted scenes will keep you entertained. I've certainly had more than a few \\"OMG!!\\" moments which left me wanting more. That, combined with the beautiful and talented casts will make this one of your favorites series to date. It certainly qualifies as one of mine.

Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw do fabulous acting..you almost have to remind yourself that they are the actors.  They portrayed their parts in an amazing & talented way!!!  I LOVED this film!!

B00354Y9ZU|5.0|Linchpin is a book that really does a great job of telling you why \\"how things used to be\\" is never going to come back, and how you protect yourself as an employee or a business owner from falling into the trap of the status quo.  And, it stokes your desire to really go out and create something as an \\"artist\\" - defined by Mr. Godin as someone who creates, not simply painters, singers, writers, etc.  The \\"artist\\" can be the customer service representative who goes above and beyond in helping out the customer, not because it's their job, but because they truly enjoy what they are doing.<br /><br />If you're at a crossroads in your life or career, Linchpin is a great read.  It will help you see what is possible, and in my case, provide motivation to truly stretch beyond my comfort zone and really try to create a career that leaves me energized at the end of the day, instead of a soul-deadening job that crushes the spirit.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

The box contains a box with a button on it, if they push it someone they do not know dies and they recieve a million dollars cash. A series of finical problems make them push the button, which is set up nicely. They see the box is nothing more then a wooden prop, no wires to say if they pushed it or not. They press the button and weird stuff starts to happen to them. The movie was going alright, nothing too great, but still enjoyable. However, the movie takes a weird turn and the movie just starts to sucks. It's too bad they couldnt keep the plot going because it could have been a good movie but the ending was stupid.

B0037W68F4|2.0|I think MGMT were trying a bit too hard on this record not to be mainstream.  What was great about their first record is that it had a new/interesting sound to it (electronic psychedelic or whatever you want to call it) and was incredibly catchy.  This one is them trying to sound like 60's artists like The Beatles, Donovan, Tommy James And The Shondells, Bob Dylan, etc. except without catchiness.  As a whole the album is a decent listen but nothing more  It really just does not have any standout songs on it.  Even the non-hits on Oracular Spectacular were much better than the songs on this.  Having liked all of their other stuff so much, I went out and bought this right away before hearing it.  I think I would rather have the 8 bucks actually.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I've seen this tv series again and again, and indeed I'm watching it now with blu-ray.  So I'm really delightful of my heart and in my head. I cannot use english well because my nature language isn't. But I want to explain my feeling for this brilliant masterpiece at least after 30 years we cannot find historical tv show like this!  Kevin Mckidd, I like his stoic style, but Titus Pulo? This unbelievable alive creature  is best character after Conan the barbarian... Love Him. Octavianus is so cool,  but he need some more color for his face. so whity.... All Roman emperor whom I imagined was more powerful and tyranic... don't you?  Nudity is also pretty thing in these shows... Now in Caprica, we can find a sexy woman who I can't tell about...   Again I Say, I really love this show.
B00361HV02|5.0|A bit of a grower but once I listened to it a few times, I became hooked.  Really nothing out of the ordinary for BRMC but why should they change their already great sound anyways?  Beat The Devil's Tattoo is probably my least favorite song on the record and is a bit of a surprise for a first single.  I enjoy all the other songs on the record though.
B001AKTZO6|5.0|I decided to buy all the remastered cd's of the Creedence Clearwater Revival albums (thanks Amazon!) because I've been a fan of the band for years. I thought it was time I heard more than just the songs from the CHRONICLES albums.    They are all fantastic, but I find myself listening to BAYOU COUNTRY slightly more than the others. Of course there's the legendary tune PROUD MARY. But BORN ON THE BAYOU is one of my absolute favorite, so those are two great reasons alone to get the album. But this album also includes 3 songs I wasn't quite familiar with:    GRAVEYARD TRAIN is a haunting blues jam that seems to move with the tempo of a slow rolling train.     BOOTLEG is a fun rock and roller that makes great use of Tom Fogerty's rhythm guitar. It's so good, I wonder why it wasn't one of their big hits.    Finally, KEEP ON CHOOGLIN' is an mesmerizing jam, played in perfect harmony by the fellas. Tom Fogerty's guitar, Stu Cook's base, Cosmo's drumming work so beautifully with John Fogerty's lead guitar, harmonica and vocals you get somewhat swept away by its power. This song may just be my new favorite!    I can't help but feel those three songs should have been included in the CHRONICLES 2 album, but whatever. It's an excuse to buy the album. No more excuses...go out and get you some BAYOU COUNTRY!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|An eye opening of a movie everyone must see.  If you do not like what you see you have the power to make changes!  I recommend this to everyone who likes chicken or beef or is wondering why they are always plagued with health problems.
0891419063|5.0|I ordered With the Old Breed from Amazon after watching Ken Burns' work on World War II<br />and seeing the first installments of Pacific on HBO. Eugene B. Sledge is featured in both<br />productions.  Sledge's treatment of the war in the Pacific hit home for me because my father<br />served as a Seabee in the Solomon Islands.  This book is very honest and reflects the horrors<br />of war and what human beings are capable of under extreme conditions. This book should be must<br />reading for all Americans who so easily send young men and women off to die in war.  The book bolsters my<br />conviction that a draft is needed when the president declares war.  If every young man and woman<br />would be eligible to serve and die to defend our nation, the Senators would be much less willing<br />to see their \\"Senator's Sons\\" go off to war.  Perhaps we would begin the task of finding other means<br />short of violence to work out our differences.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|I understand people's frustration and i don't blamed them. I personally was looking forward on buying this Blu-ray version of Avatar, but when i saw it was a combo i changed my mind. They will release a DVD version, so why not sell a Blu-ray version with all the features even if we have to pay $5 more or a Blu-ray 3D version for $10 more. I'll just wait for a future special edition release.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Love this movie, but this release is a blatant money-grab by the studio.  Don't get ripped off - wait for the real version with extra footage coming later this year!
1416575464|4.0|The author of the only one-star review does not like anything!  Take this book for what it is -- a primer on decorating.  It's a great beginner's design book.  It has a broad range of ideas to emulated.  The photos are on par with most design books.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|This film is not for the squeemish or those with short attention spans and trouble reading English subtitles. This is not a conventional war movie nor does it pretend to be. This is well written, brilliantly acted, WWII revenge fantasy. Those expecting a standard morality play with white-hatted good guys or a non-stop shoot-em-up action romp will be sorely disappointed. Those who appreciate a clever story, snappy dialogue (and lots of it), and some very brief scenes of fairly graphic war violence will be thrilled.

B0015HOFZI|3.0|Cheap plastic, quirky software but it does make a good quality recording. I've had all of the problems that others have stated and the instructions are useless to try and resolve software problems. First, my OS is Vista and I couldn't get the PC to recognize the turntable or monitor the recording level. Once I got it to work, I realized that YOU MUST connect the turntable to the PC BEFORE you open the sound forge program. As long as you do that, everything works fine but that isn't mentioned anywhere in the instructions. The other thing with the software is when you finish saving a recording it asks if your finished or record another. I have to select finish and re-enter recording otherwise I can't enter the track information on the next recording.    Mechanically, I can only use it as a manual table. In automatic, the tonearm will touch the record and then be returned to the rest. Sometimes, it will keep cycling until I stop the platter manually and rotate it counter clockwise to disengage the mechanism. My guess is that something needs to be cleaned or oiled but I haven't had a chance to look into it.   I've recorded about 300 albums with no complaints with the sound quality but if you have a working turntable, there are other options available to you to use your existing equipment.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I never write reviews, but I disliked this movie so much, I felt a need to steer people from it. I first heard about Lost in Austen at a store from a salesperson who recommended it to me upon learning I was a big Jane Austen fan.  I did not purchase it but went to the local video store to rent it.  I am so glad I did because I took it back that night after I watched it. This movie took the wonderful story of Pride & Prejudice and ripped it to shreds, making Mr. Bingley a drunk, sending Charlotte abroad as a missionary and having Mr. Wickham as a victim of Georgiana Darcy. I could not stand the main character or the actress who played her and did not find Mr. Darcy handsome or appealing. If you like Pride & Prejudice, avoid this movie.  It isn't worth your time or money.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|The visuals are great! But there is absolutely no story. Or rather, Very little story. The Origins of the Mayan prophesies are glossed over and little attention is paid to them, except as a vehicle to get us to the moment of crisis - 2012. At that point it's just another action roller coaster packed with really great visuals. Don't expect a real story. Just enjoy the ride.
B001LMU182|5.0|I'll join the chorus of others in saying that AKIRA was my first real foray into Japanese animation, and nothing else in that spectrum -- not even Miyazaki's works -- has quite captured my imagination with the same intensity as this film.  Every single element is amplified to the maximum with the apocalyptic stakes of the story, the layered storytelling, and the ferocity of technique; AKIRA is ultra-violent, ultra-detailed, ultra-colorful, and ultra-LOUD.  It is nothing less than an overwhelming experience.    Which is why this Blu-ray is such a marvel.  I first encountered this film on its two-disc Pioneer release, and while I thought it looked good at the time, the Blu-ray blows it out of the water.  I never realized that Otomo drew these characters with irises in their eyes!  Fine detail is much improved, and the colors are saturated and vibrant.  While as a traditionally-animated film it lacks that three-dimensional \\"pop\\" associated with the finest live-action transfers, the visual presentation on this disc is astounding and a tremendous upgrade over the DVD.    Unfortunately, my audio set-up doesn't support the 24-bit, 192 kHz Japanese TrueHD track that everyone is raving about, but even the Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital track roared on my system.  My biggest pet peeve with the Pioneer set was that the original Japanese performances were only available in the stereo track (which is also provided here in PCM), so even with this \\"lesser\\" track I am quite pleased.  I've not watched the film with the English TrueHD track as I find the English dub somewhat lacking.    My only real complaint is that almost none of the special features from that Pioneer set have been carried over to this release, including the making-of documentary, the piece on the unique musical score, or the interview with Otomo.  All that is here are trailers and storyboards, so if you want these features, you'll have to either keep or procure a copy of the second disc of that Pioneer set.  I've gotmine temporarily in a paper sleeve and plan on purchasing a two-disc Blu-ray case in the future to keep it close at hand.  This is really a small grievance, however, because the presentation quality of this newest release is so wonderful.  It really is the best way to enjoy AKIRA, barring a theatrical presentation.    Absolutely worth the upgrade.  A phenomenal presentation of a phenomenal film.
B000002C1V|5.0|Released in 1983.  All 12 songs written by Waters. It is an extention of \\"The Wall\\".  Pink Floyd don't write songs, they paint pictures with music and lyrics.  A couple of the cuts hints about the Japanense taking over British manufacturing jobs.  He beats up on Maggie (Margaret Thatcher), and most of the world leaders of the early 80s and still finds time to lament about the death of his father in world war II and touch on thoughts of suicide. The last song \\"Two Suns in the Sunsets\\" is about the next holocaust that will be caused by the nuclear bomb and comparing it to the slow motion of being involved in an auto accident.  Get the CD and a copy of the lyrics. Lock yourself in a room, and bury yourself in both.
B00371QQ2U|4.0|First off, this is easily a five-star film.  It's handsome, taut, and thoroughly engaging.<br /><br />For picture and audio quality, this Blu-ray is obviously superior to prior releases.  There is moderate film grain to the transfer, giving it a natural feel.  The special effects (i.e. the launch sequence) receive the greatest benefit and the clearest visuals, but on the whole the film is beautifully rendered and, for these benefits, the Blu-ray is worth picking up.<br /><br />I do concur, however, that this disc has some slight issues.  It takes too long to load -- I timed it at roughly two minutes on my slim PS3.  This is mildly annoying but comparable to other Universal and Disney releases.  I was more annoyed that after waiting for the BD-Java to load, selecting \\"English,\\" waiting for more loading, waiting for the menu to animate, and selecting the film that I was treated to a \\"social BLU\\" splash page asking me if I wanted my Facebook status updated.  What aggravated me was that this admittedly brief interruption occurred after I had already selected to play the film, and it would seem that it will occur every time I choose to do so; it was an unwanted and, in my opinion, rather lame attempt to add \\"interactivity,\\" if having your Blu-ray player post that you're watching a film on your Facebook wall can be considered as such.  I would rather that this option could be turned off BEFORE I select to watch the film, and that this setting could be saved.  Additionally, advertisements for other Universal products pop-up in the background of the menus, presumably for \\"shopping convenience\\" but really an irritating marketing gimmick.  These so-called bonuses serve to make the general experience of navigating this disc feel very clunky.<br /><br />Overall, the content in this package (which carries over most of the content from the last two-disc DVD) is fantastic, but the design of the disc's menus and bonuses suffers from baffling and annoying gimmicks that are mildly aggravating but hardly ruin the experience; you'll forget about the hiccups once the film starts and you're engrossed.  If you are a fan of the film and have the necessary equipment to benefit from the technical improvements in this release, it is highly recommended.<br /><br />But, Universal?  In the future, either streamline your gimmicks or leave them off the disc.  We purchase these to watch the films, not to update our social networks.<br /><br />EDIT 3/15/12: If possible, disable your player's internet connection when playing this disc. Without streaming trailers and that other crap, this disc loads right up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you do so. Makes the experience much less bile-inducing.
1595141715|5.0|This isn't a true story, but it might as well be.  It took a few pages for me to get into the book, but once I did I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book to everyone, if for no other reason that to realize that suicide is a tragedy.  That even if it is about getting attention its still serious, and deserves attention!

B002ZCDR88|4.0|Natalie Merchant has long left the commercial/mainstream musical scene. Her previous 2 albums, 2001's \\"Motherland\\" and 2003's \\"The House Carpenter's Daughter\\" were each fantastic, and deeply personal, albums, so for anyone looking for more of \\"Tigerlily\\" or even the 10,000 Maniacs sound, surely a disappoitment. Since her last album 7 years ago, Natalie became a mother and she has spent time away to be with her young daughter. Now comes the long-awaited new album.<br /><br />\\"Leave Your Sleep\\" (2 CDs; 26 tracks; 105 min.) is Natalie's most personal album yet, if you can believe that. In the Introduction of the wonderful 80 page booklet that comes with this album, Natalie writes \\"This collection of songs represents parts of a long conversation I've had with my daughter during the first six years of her life\\". The entire collection overwhelms you at first, given the scope of the project, and it takes several listens to start feeling at home with it, so to speak. This is, in essence, a childrens' album for adults, although it doesn't sound like that. From the first sounds of the opening track \\"Nursery Rhymes of Innocense and Experience\\", the album gives a distinct feeling of Irish-themed music (with lots of flutes in many of the songs), while others feel like cabaret-lite (and I mean that in the best sense). The reggae-flavored \\"Topsyturvy World\\" is a rare (but great) departure. But what carries this album more than anything else, is Natalie's warm and soothing voice.<br /><br />Despite the personal theme to the album, I did not find the emotional bond that I had (and still have) with the \\"Motherland\\" and \\"House Carpenter\\" albums, reason I rate this album \\"only\\" 4 stars. That said, if you are on the fence about buying the single CD \\"Selections\\" or this double CD, by all means, by the double CD, you won't regert it. For a few more dollars, it gets you 10 extra songs, and the already-mentioned fabulous 80 page booklet, with all the lyrics, and even better, Natalie's musings on how all of the songs came about, in particular the background on the poets and poems that inspired the songs. I will never tire of listening to her voice and her singing, reason I have bought all of her albums (most of them sound unheard, as I did here).<br /><br />I have seen Natalie in concert a number of times over the years in her solo career, and I have never been disappointed by any of her performances. Thrilled is a better way to express it. I hope to catch her soon on her impending US tour. Can't wait for that.f the songs came about, in particular the background on the poets and poems that inspired the songs.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|It's quite a simple choice really.<br /><br />If you just want the movie - buy this one.<br />If you want the bonus features - wait until November.<br />If you want 3D - wait until whenever.<br /><br />It's pretty simple. They're upfront about the release strategy so, quit yer whinin' and bitchin' 'bout double dippin'!!
6305949638|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It deals with everything from sex to racism to abortion in a way that is easy to understand, and there are no major complications involved in the plot. It's sort of like something you would expect from John Stienbeck. Buy it, you're sure to like it.
B003405MF6|5.0|Although compared to \\"You Had it Coming\\", this would be considered \\"laid back\\". However it's nice to hear another side of Jeff Beck. And, for several years Jeff has expressed a desire to do an album with a symphonic orchestra. What's wrong with that?! Absolutely nothing! Though I'm sure there will be those that will whine, and wonder if Jeff's gone \\"soft\\". Not a chance in hell!! Don't be surprised if the next one is even more outrageous than \\"Y.H.I.C\\"!    But there's still some fairly aggressive stuff on here. \\"Hammerhead\\" is one of those rare pieces of music that I liked instantly! It also has a type of beat and feel that I haven't heard in a very long time. \\"There's no Other Me\\" is another heavy-handed Jeff beast, with Joss Stone singing to the absolute hilt! But, probably most of the album is the more \\"beautiful\\" side of Jeff's playing, and the combination of guitar accompanied by beautiful strings. \\"Over the Rainbow\\" has the same affect it had on me as a kid when I saw Judy sing it in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". It's difficult not to get a little \\"choked up\\" once again! Aside from the beautiful playing on this piece, Jeff gets even more complex with the way he maneuvers one note around than during the most difficult passage in \\"Where Were You!\\" Not only that, but there's a gorgeous key change, as well.     Another tune \\"Serene\\", reminds me of something Joe Zawinul would have written, once the main guitar/keyboard harmony part comes in. A sort of joyous, worldbeat, \\"Weather Report\\" kind of vibe, with strings. If you like the jazz singer Melody Gardot, you may be pleased to notice a striking similarity between her and Imelda May who sings on \\"Nessun Dorma\\". Speaking of which, about the only thing I don't like on this album is the \\"over-the-top\\" motion picture theme-type crescendo at the very ending of this tune. And, when Jeff tears into what sounds like it's going to be the killer agresso-rock solo of the album (at the end of \\"There's No Other Me\\"), there is a bizarre sudden fadeout! Too bad!    Nevertheless, we have the \\"poetic\\" side of Jeff on most of this beautifully produced album. And if you can't be open enough to let him show another side to his music, then that's your loss!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Love this movie~ my 1 year old and my 11 year both enjoy watching this movie~ I love the fact that Disney provides a regular dvd and a digital copy with each blue ray disc~ so we can watch this movie anywhere/ anytime!
B0000262QW|4.0|Fusion is one of those words a lot of people bristle hearing: I am one--I love early electric Miles and progressive rock, but groups with that fusion tag make me take my fingers off the CD box as if I just touched sulfuric acid, or a Leo Sayer album'<br /><br />So, I was not SUPPOSED to like this: which goes to show you both how little I know and how little genre labels reveal. This is simply a lovely album, with long but focused improvisations, fantastically delicate work by Corea on the electric paino, and low and behold, a wonderful Bossa Nova track with a female singer as lovely to sing it.<br /><br />What a fantastic record.<br /><br />But if you think you can get me to listen to an album with that \\"soft rock of the 70s\\" marquee, go someplace else. I have not learned my lesson THAT well

2839906171|5.0|Lots of people talk about business models, but words alone can't capture the interconnected, systems, wholistic nature of business models. That's why this book is so incredibly useful. For the many people who understand better with pictures, the nine interconnected blocks of a business model laid out in this book will change forever the way you think about value creation systems - be it businesses, non-profits, or even government. I've used this revolutionary visual model to explain the concept of business models to those who have never heard about the concept before, as well as to develop business model innovations for my start-up based on business model challenges that came to light through using this model.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is a spectacular documentary that should be in the collection of all WWII historians. It captures the essentials of the progress of the war and documents the perspectives of the common people, key government officials, and soldiers on all sides. This series set the benchmark for understanding WWII when it was originally released in the early '70s. The narration is superb, as well as the film documentation, the interviews and the overall balance of the individual episodes and the complete set.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Just got it in the mail and popped it into my BD player and wow!!  I cannot believe just how effortless the BD version is better than the standard version which I've rented and watched a few times awhile ago.  It has a lot of extras and I like the organization of everything - so smooth and clear and easy to use, how you can \\"play all\\" of a lot of the extra features.  Also if you leave it playing in your BD player after the movie is over, after a few minutes, it goes silent and has a nice Universal Icon rotating against a nice quiet background.  As opposed to lots of other dvds/BDs that just keep playing the movie music tune over and over and over again until you turn it off or select something else. I totally enjoyed the movie like new.  For those picky collectors, there were a few scenes that seemed darker, but overall rating, I'd still give it a 100%.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|We learned so much about what is going on in the food industry from this movie.  The chemicals in other types of food have been turning us into organic shoppers, this just did it for the meat.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This video of the movie is a \\"must have\\" for your library if you are religious. It will strengthen your faith if you believe in Christ as our Savior. This is a video you should watch periodically to remind your self of Jesus' sacrifice for our sins.
B0039OGGVQ|2.0|This is an ordinary album from an outstanding guitarist doing what he usual does(guitar solos), using big names in the industry(this is a four letter word).  Come on people.  Don't you ask for just a little bit from these entertainers or is the name good enough for your dollar?
B000002A3T|5.0|Yes, this is not \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side...\\", but if left to gestate and resonate with the imagination, you'll find a haunting, ethereal and satisfying entry into the pink floyd catalogue. A steady journey to a distant sonic horizon where \\"the grass is greener and the river flows forever and ever...\\"
B00005MKA3|5.0|Exodus was one of Bob Marley's most important albums.  Being in hiding after an attempt on his life, the songs are driven and taunting.  Songs like \\"Guiltiness\\" and \\"Jammin'\\" have a very \\"I'm still here no matter what\\" kind of thing going on.  Upon first listening, it was almost scary.  Songs like Natural Mystic and Heathen are dark.  Exodus hit me like a ton of bricks, it was very powerful.    After that came Kaya, a lighter side of Bob Marley.  It was here that he had fun and focused more on the powers of spirituality.  I guess people criticized this effort, saying that he wimped out.  Personally, I truly enjoy this album and I find it a staple in the catalog.      Then came the album that we're reviewing, Survival.  Wow.  And I thought Exodus was powerful.  This album is a heavy listen at first.  I had to take it in small doses.  The messages are very powerful and very serious.  The music itself makes the songs only \\"seem\\" lighter.  But this stuff is heavy.  It is fast becoming my favorite album.  It really doesn't have any \\"hits\\".  The band from this era is my favorite.  Obviously Carly and Aston Barrett are still holding down the rhythm section and the I Threes are still doing their thing.  But everyone else just makes Bob shine.  The music is so militant.  It just reminds me of a positive vibration army coming from a distance ready to fight for freedom.  The grooves are tight and very strong and hard.      You can hear the militant and almost angry quality in the production itself.  Carly's drums are very forward.  His unmistakable cross-stick, kick and Hi-Hat are there as usual but the sound of his Tom-Toms is huge.  It's a very big and in your face.  Aston's bass is huge and commanding.  The horn section provides very dramatic and stabbing lines.  The I-Threes as well are dramatic and very forward.    Maybe I'm making this album seem to dark, but when you hear songs like Africa Unite and One Drop you'll know that the positivity and good vibes are still there, it's just that now they're putting our foot down and delivering a message against the oppressors.      My favorite moment is Africa Unite.  The first few seconds immediately send chills through my body.  Everything is good when that song is on.    Excellent excellent record.  I highly recommend it.
B001R0KH3M|3.0|Lively performance by the group and the quality of the DVD sound and audio is good, but...  I agree w/ others in the \\"way too much sing along\\".  Also, Stevie delves too much in the obscure and sings shortened versions of the hits I wanted to hear.  Would not buy it again and not likely to watch for several years.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|One of the most influential movies I have seen. I have decided not to eat meat or chicken because of this movie. I owe it to myself, the animals and the planet!If everyone would watch this movie maybe we have a chance of fighting the corporations who are destroying the farming industry. It's time to speak up and support our local organic farmers and the companies who buy from them. Anyone with children should watch this movie!
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Great vidz, has some old stuff and remember you can rip the music.<br />Has some interesting stuff that I never knew about their band plus the show is very watchable.
B002TZS5GU|1.0|Look... I'm gonna be fair.  You obviously clicked on, or started reading this review because you wanted to know what someone thought was so bad about this movie.  In spite of the fact that I would love to yell from the rooftops about how much this movie sucks, I'm not going to ruin it for you.  If you don't mind a movie that wastes a good percentage of its playtime trying to squeeze a laugh out of you with cliché, misplaced comedy...then this will be the ultimate cinematic experience for you. If you're unlike me, and DON'T notice guns that NEVER need reloading, characters that never eat, drink, or sleep, and make decisions that no human in their right mind would make, because the writer wasn't thoughtful enough to inject some semblance of realism in his/her story...then go for it. If you don't mind not giving a crap whether or not a character lives or dies, because the creators spent no time at all on character development...be my guest (take that back...there were a couple of people, but the geniuses behind this masterpiece decided to remove them from the story way too early).  If you're satisfied with the plot of a film being `let's see who makes it to the end'...don't waste anymore time reading this, and add this gem of a movie to your shopping cart.  The one thing this movie had going for it was decent performances from the actors...who should have taken their talent elsewhere.      I'll probably get bashed for this review...but who cares.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I was skeptical when i first saw that this show was going to be on the CW. i had never read the books before and didnt know what to really expect. i decided to watch the first episode as i figured if it was aweful, atleast i could say i gave it a shot since I am a Twilight/True Blood fan. I am happy to say i havent missed an episode yet. The characters draw you in from start to finish, its a totally different show from everything else. I even read the books during the show's winter hiatus so that i would be ready for the rest of the season. I would definitely recommend this show to everyone!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I heard the last part of Little Lion Man on a radio show on the way home from work.  I searched ALL over for the cd and ended up ordering from Amazon!  I got the cd and instantly fell in love!!  From their voices to the instruments playing to the lyrics, it keeps you wondering what each song could hold!! A song could start slow and end up knocking your socks off! You can hear the passion and energy from everything that is put into each song!  I am very impressed!  I love music and these guys will stay on my Top 10 forever!      I can not stop listening to the cd!  I also can not wait to hear more!!  Heck I cant wait to see these guys live!!     If you are unsure as to whether or not you should buy this album...GO FOR IT!!!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!
B003EVFHYG|5.0|Since I saw this movie in theaters a while ago, I have been waiting to get the soundtrack. Its everything I wanted and more. The music ranges from stirring, flowing melodies to brash and exciting. It takes me back to the theater as if I were watching the movie all over again. This is one I will be listening to over and over for sure!
B00337KM2S|4.0|The sophisticated comedy of manners, which saw its heyday in cinema with the films of Ernst Lubitsch and Howard Hawks, went out of style so long ago that it sometimes seems like a lost art.  As one who appreciates this particular kind of comedy, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that Up in the Air is, in many respects, a comedy of manners in the Howard Hawks vein.    Sure-footed and seasoned professional George Clooney engages in love-duel with his intellectual equal, Hawksian woman Vera Farmiga, while tutoring the equally competent but less experienced Anna Kendrick.  It's all done in rapid-fire banter of the type that was Hawks' comedic trademark.  It makes me wonder if director Jason Reitman was thinking of Hawks when he made this film.    Of course, this film is about unemployment and the Great Recession, so the comedy has to be tinged with a shot of realism, and the story does take a few detours to highlight the superficiality of the main character's lifestyle, but for me Up in the Air was a welcome reminder that Hollywood still appreciates urbane humor.  If you do too, then I think you'll like Up in the Air.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I obtained this because I wanted to see the first Biblical epic, and I was really impressed with the acting and with the sets, and most of all the story.  I thought that the conflict between Robert Taylor as the Roman Marcus Vinicius and Deborah Kerr as the Christian Lygia was captivating, as she slowly turns him around from his beliefs.  I like it that the sets and grandeur did not ever distract from the character development, and it was fascinating to me to see how historical and fictional events were mixed in the story, especially with the inclusion of the Apostles Paul and Peter and the way the fire of Rome starts.  In fact, Nero did not necessarily cause the fire in Rome and organized relief efforts afterward, but he did blame the Christians; in Quo Vadis, Poppaea, Nero's sinister wife, persuades him to blame the Christians out of spite that Marcus Vinicius loves Lygia instead of her.  I really enjoyed the documentary and audiocommentary on this, as well.      There are really only 3 things I wish were different on the movie:    1.  Mainly, Marcus Vinicius's conversion is rather humanistic.  He prays to Christ near the end for help, and recognizes that Christians know how to die bravely and that Christianity brings peace and stability to the world through its message of love for one's enemies, but there is no indication of a special personal yielding to God.  The audiocommentary talked about John Huston's (who was going to be the director, and who actually had no use for religion) idea of Marcus's conversion, which I think I'd have liked better:  As he's trying to rescue Lygia from the fire in Rome, he makes a promise to God to become a Christian if He spares Lygia and gains understanding of the faith after he's rescued her.    2.  Finlay Currie as the Apostle Peter definitely has the passion and holy aura, especially with his long white beard, but he did seem unrealistic because of his Scottish accent.  At the same time, it's not supposed to be entirely authentic, and part of the appeal of a movie that takes place long ago is that you feel like you're entering another world, which is enjoyable whether it's realistic or not.    3.  Marcus's uncle Petronius (who really was in Nero's court and lost favor) commits suicide and justifies himself by noting the Christians say death leads to a better life, and I think there should have been some kind of a condemnation of his suicide subtly presented in the movie.  Movies send moral messages, and I wish Petronius had not been shown so favorably all the way through, because then his suicide would not elicit a sympathetic reaction from the viewer.  I was hoping there could be an obvious contrast between his choice of suicide and the Christians' choice of martyrdom that would show martyrdom, the more painful kind of death, as being preferable because God is honored by that and not by suicide.  Even a line or two of dialogue about that from one of the main characters (like Marcus, Petronius's nephew) after they'd hear of Petronius's death would have been satisfactory.    However, to most viewers, having a strongly Christian statement is not as important as it is to me, and I found absolutely nothing offensive about Quo Vadis; I just wish it had gone farther in its affirmation of Christianity.  Aside from that minor disappointment, I enjoyed the movie very much and enjoyed the special features equally well, and even though Nero is deranged, you can't help but enjoy him because Peter Ustinov is such a comedic actor!  I thought the acting on the movie was really exemplary.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Ok - so I am a Brit and have no clue as to how the American collegiate system works, especially when it comes to sporting scholarships.<br /><br />Also I had not heard of The Blind Side......at all. In fact I was just minding my own business and getting on a flight from London to Mexico City, ready to hanker down for a nice long 10 hour sleep.<br />But the flight attendants were busying themselves to serve the food and the cabin was buzzing, so I thought I would watch the first 1/2 hr or so of a film whilst I waited for everything to calm down and the cabin lights to be dimmed.<br /><br />I picked The Blind Side because I was convinced that the film would hold absoluteley no appeal to me. In hindsight, this turned out to be far from the truth.<br /><br />Firstly, Sandra Bullock is one of those mainstream actresses that is eminantly watchable and likeable. Yes, her films usually won't rattle your life or even leave you with a huge amount to think about, but they are usually fun and enjoyable. In this though, you soon forget that it is Sandra in the role and quickly become immersed in the life and kindness of Leigh Anne.<br /><br />Secondly, even most real-life stores are dramatised for added impact/effect with tensions built for little reason other than viewer entertainment. In this film I found the reflection of a real life family really compelling. It is startingly different to watch a film where you are drawn into the lives of the people on-screen without relying on gimmicks to keep your attention.<br /><br />Thirdly, the courage and fortitude of Michael Oher, born into indifference, poverty and lack of opportunity, and his ability to simply be a decent and kind man, overwhelming the odds, making a life that brings both him and his adopted family such wealth and joy, is simply profoundly moving.<br /><br />Suffice to say, I did not get much sleep on the flight and arrived in Mexico tired but happy. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to be blind sided once in a while.
0764207407|3.0|Of course, Jane Austen is fabulous. Set in England's Regency period, the story revolves around the Dashwood sisters and their love interests. The difference with this edition is the inclusion of notes on the side relating geographic info, historic tidbits, info about the movies based on the book, theological reflections and the opinions of the editors about the story and characters.<br /><br />At first, I was put off by the constant interruption of the side notes. I grew to appreciate mainly the historical and geographical information, but occasionally felt irked by the opinion flavored notes. I think if I were choosing between a notated or un-notated novel, I'd choose the latter.  Nevertheless, any Jane Austen book is well worth reading. (I received a copy of this book free from Bethany Publishers.)
0671449028|4.0|I love my infant son and when he gets bigger I'll enjoy reading him stories like huck finn and so on but while he's a baby I tend to put reading to him off, mostly because his mother takes care of it. I like this story.  It's rhyming with neat pictures and it's short and sweet.  You can read it 3-4 times to your child in a few minutes and if you emphasize the repetitions they really dig it.
0446563048|4.0|Tony Hsieh is ambitious, a visionary and has a wonderful sense of humour. He delivers an absolutely light-hearted read for those who truly believe that happinesss comes from living with passion, having a goal and that being successful does not mean sacrificing your integrity. According to Tony it is all about giving people the experiences that they will never forget, whether it selling shoes, pizza or software. This is a great book for anyone wanting to start a company of their own - and who want to make sure that their original vision stays intact as they higher more people.  He has some great interview questions along with goals of customer service that lend a different point of view.<br /><br />The only thing that was a little off-putting is the idea that as an Asian American, and being in a family where overachievement is the norm, you can see where having privelege probably makes him just a little blind to the struggles that some of us have had to grow up with or face in education and the workplace.  All in all, however, It was a very satisfying read and applicable for anyone who works or is thinking of starting their own business.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|I agree that this could have been a better film. It never quite finds its pace as a thriller, gets a little too into slasher territory. Less gore and more suspense would have helped. The ending is ridiculous, as others have pointed out. The cliche of the criminally insane genius is so played out -- next we'll be expected to believe that a guy like that has godlike powers. Still, it's not a bad movie. Bad guys and good guys alike get killed in inventive ways. There are a few surprises. The cast is good, Jamie Foxx as an assistant district attorney, Gerard Butler as the victim of a violent crime. If you're in the mood to veg out with a movie, this one be fine.
B002RI9SC4|4.0|I personally enjoyed the book. I have read a lot of reviews about this book and i feel that some of the readers have been a bit harsh in their critiscisms. i personally loved the first three books, especially the third, and especially loved that they did get more mature.     for me what this book lacked was the climatic ending that eclipse had, with the action making a thrilling conclusion. If not to spoil anything, the book was set up for a thrilling ending which never quite happened for me.    Still a good read but i just feel it hasn't quite finished
B00338QELU|3.0|I think this book is a victim of its publisher's marketing department. Keen to piggyback on the success of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, it was presented as a Nordic thriller akin to Stieg Larsen (e.g., \\"If you liked X, try Y...\\"). Well, I loved the Larsen books -- the fast pace, the countless twists and turns, the killer endings -- so I eagerly bought this in eBook format and delved in. This book was was ... OK.     I agree with a lot of other reviewers here who said that the book seriously lost focus in the latter half. The info about Chinese current events and recent history really derailed the forward momentum of the book. I felt that there were still lots of loose threads and unanswered questions by the end. And it all wound up, lickety split, in the last few chapters, without a satisfying ending.    But while a lot of the deep political writing in the middle section of the book didn't really seem to have a place in a thriller (it seriously slowed down the pace), I found it interesting on an intellectual level. As a US citizen, it's fascinating (and frankly, important) to see the world from other perspectives. Mankell was able to get inside the heads of the Chinese characters (and also see China through the eyes of the Swedish characters) and provide us with some valid, if not always sympathetic, worldviews. Though I didn't always agree with the politics they espoused, I think we ignore their perspectives at our own peril.     I didn't expect a political education with this book, but that's what I got. And I liked that! But I wish there had been more swashbuckling thriller action and less of a deus-ex-machina ripoff ending.

B000066744|5.0|The Legend of 1900 is an amazing film about a man who was born on a cruise ship in 1900, and never set foot on land. Abandoned as a newborn in the ballroom of the ship, 1900 is found, adopted, and given his name by a crewman. One night in his childhood, he is discovered playing the piano in the ballroom by the captain and astonished guest. Why astonished? Because he's a prodigy.<br /><br />The film is narrated by 1900's friend, Max, a trumpet player who meets him on the night the ship is being tossed around by a storm. Max is seasick as hell, and 1900 helps him through. Max and 1900 become fast friends, and the film flashes back and forth in time during Max's narration, from Max's present, at the port where the now-ancient ship is rusty and ready for demolition, and the ship's heyday. We watch 1900 as a true musician; he's a man who just loves playing piano for everyone, rich or poor. We also see him through the eyes of the passengers he meets.<br /><br />The score is beautiful and haunting, with a touch of aching nostalgia thrown in for good measure. I have the soundtrack on my wish list!<br /><br />I do hope that you give this movie the time it deserves. The acting was engaging, and you really get sucked into the story before you know it.

Do not expect high art but rather an enjoyable rainy afternoon curled up with a cup of tea and a warm quilt kind of movie.

0446563048|5.0|* There's a lot to be said about the egregious executive structure and the ever-fluctuating state of the economy as it affects the working public, especially here in the United States.  However, what is addressed and outlined here in these few pages by one of America's youngest and most successful corporate CEO's gives me reason to hope.<br /><br />*  Brief Overview<br />** Lessons Learned/ The Author's Transformation<br />*** Conclusion<br /><br />** DELIVERING HAPPINESS: A PATH TO PROFIT, PASSION AND PURPOSE is essentially one man's journal entry from boyhood entrepreneurship to geo-centric, corporate executive icon.  It is also the measure of his spiritual matriculation.<br /><br />This is the remarkable story of Tony Hsieh (pronounced \\"Shay\\") and, later, people involved with the formation and participation in the day-to-day function of his latest company, Zappos.<br /><br />Hsieh's rise was, by most accounts, rapid and unorthodox.  (Perhaps, this was what was meant to be.)  From his early recollection, Hsieh says of himself that he was instinctively goal-oriented in a way peculiarly different than the expectations set for him by his parents and the Asian-American community.  Instead of newspaper routes, Hsieh by some unknown instinct was entertaining  much bigger and, might I say, stranger business ideas like creating a worm farm.  He looked at the logic of supply and demand (and, we're talking in his middle/ junior high school years now).  This venture didn't prove to be what he anticipated, but it didn't deter him from exploring other potentially lucrative avenues, much to the chagrin of his parents.<br /><br />One of the more successful projects he undertook worth mentioning here was a picture-button business he thought about after seeing an ad in the back of a boys' monthly magazine.  What's special here is the fact that Hsieh wasn't only thinking about the nickel and dime profits associated with those selling merchandise for kiddie toys: he thought practically about the bottom line.  After surmising that he could make an unlimited amount of sales through a mail order business, he devised a makeshift business model that was good enough for his parents to invest in and a magazine marketing department to allow his ad to run in its pages.<br /><br />Some years later, while a student at Harvard, Hsieh was involved with several catering businesses, but most intriguing and instrumental to his later success was an incident involving one of his classes that he was about to fail in.<br /><br /> Hsieh was about to flunk a religion course that he failed to show up at since day one (how he managed to stay enrolled is a question that remains unanswered!)  He discovered by chance the then-emerging social networking capabilities inherent in the internet.  He created a discussion board using the pool of possible questions that would be drawn from to make the final exam.  Over the course of a couple of days, to his surprise, he found people very passionate and very eager to be involve with any project that might enable them to share their interest.  Aha!  A light went off in Hsieh's head and it would prove to be one of the defining moments and a key in his later success.<br /><br />Hsieh would graduate and take a job at Oracle in California, but would leave that job in a matter of months to start up a company with one of his Harvard friends who also took a position with Oracle.  The move was risky, but by now, he was familiar with that feeling of certainty of success when it came upon him.  This, believe it or not, was not the denouement for him, just its predecessor.  The challenges both professionally and personally would occur some two years later when a start-up company with a funny name and its free-spirited and zealous employees risked bankruptcy.<br /><br />*** Hsieh risked it all.  He didn't have to.  The employees of Zappos did the same.  They, too, didn't have to.  But, they needed to.  There was something both Hsieh, the executives at his investment firm and the company of employees learned about the quality of belief.  The belief in one's ability to meet any challenge.  The belief in another's right to freely express their humanity without fear of discrimination.  The belief in a vision of a healthy global economy.  The belief in a free-market system that is both profitable and yet not unethical.  All of this came about when this community of people, including Hsieh himself, was asked to sacrifice for a larger goal above their individual needs.<br /><br />Do I think this book will change the corrupt corporate structure of executive compensation, foreign exploitation, disregard for natural resources and dwindling remunerations to local-based employees on the whole?  No, but at least it's a start.  It shows that you can have a corporate CEO that is both fiscally responsible and socially and ethically concerned.  This story, indeed, serves as another example of individuals who are making a real, real difference.  And that, for me, makes all the difference in the world.e quality of belief.

B000BGH22W|4.0|I must say, I bought this disc only for the Wierd Sister songs, and with those I am overjoyed to have had. I listened to the rest of the soundtrack, and all though it definatly isn't as amazing as the original John Williams score, it definatly is a good one, and I m very happy to have purchased this album.
B000F8O4DQ|4.0|Back in the days of vinyl and when this WAS \\"A New World Record\\", I remember thinking that each side had a couple of good tunes mixed in with some pretty ones. I always thought that this was a bit below some of the ones around it consistency wise. Nowadays, I find that the ones I though were okay haven't aged quite as well as one would hope. The album begins with Tightrope which I like a lot and is a nice rocker. Next up, Telephone Line which was the BIG hit at the time and while nice enough, I really felt that ELO had done this sort of thing before and better with songs like Strange Magic, Can't Get It Out Of My Head and so on. I still feel the same way about Rockaria too. It reminds me too much of the same thing that the band had already tried on their version of Roll Over Beethoven. Mission (A New World Record) is a pretty ballad and I find it takes the album back up to the quality of Tightrope. So far, two real standouts.<br /><br />Next up, side two opens with a fun song called So Fine which just makes you feel good all over. Livin' Thing is okay but has always been overplayed in my personal opinion. Above The Clouds is quite relaxing. Do Ya dates back to The Move and Todd Rundgren's Utopia had done a cover of it the year before on [[ASIN:B0018BXMNC Another Live]]. The Move had done a cover of The Nazz song Open My Eyes and Todd refers to it in the notes. Anyway, the ELO version here is quite good. Shangri-La is another stand out ballad although I don't really think Hey Jude is faded, lol. That brings the number of stand outs to 5 out of 9 with the stand outs being real standouts for the most part.<br /><br />At the time the band was doing heavy touring while trying to write and record this album so it's no wonder that this album is a bit mixed. The bonus tracks are nice with Surrender being a standout. I really wish that this one had been put out on the album back in the old days!

0061914177|5.0|I first heard about Gary when reading a blogging book called Beyond Blogging by Nathan Hangen and Mike C. Jones.  There I had seen his past and story to how he came about to where he is presently.  He is certainly an idol to many, but he makes sure he is not your idol (sorry Gary if I am putting words in your mouth) but I think he would agree with me when I say that he wants to you to be happy and not just follow someone or have an idol to think about what you could become.  He wants you to become what you want ASAP and prove to others why anyone can become their idol or whoever they want to be.<br /><br />Additionally, it challenges you to finally do something that you will love doing. Gary says many times during his speaking appearances who he got just 1% unhappy with what he was doing and decided that things needed to change.<br /><br />I have discussed this book with many of my friends because I believe that we all can \\"Crush it!\\" and be happy and successful.  The problem is that they just do not believe in the non-traditional things of becoming successful, which is what Gary talks about.  As a college student this book has really pushed me to focus on what I want to really do with my life and I recommend making many mind maps while reading this book.<br /><br />All I have to say is if you go into reading this book with a positive/ open mindset you will be glad when you are finished reading the book.<br /><br />I will recommend reading the book Tribes by Seth Godin together with this book.<br /> [[ASIN:1591842336 Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us]]

I am just writing this to assure anyone that has not seen the show that it is worth the purchase.<br />This is one of the few shows out there now that is worth your time. This show has intelligence. The writers believe their audience is intelligent, and not into the boring potty-humor that makes most shows so popular today.<br />VERY witty dialogue, very romantic, hilariously funny, and very mysterious.<br />The writers reference pop-culture constantly, but these references are (mostly) for those that have a background of classic movies, and 70s & 80s television and music knowledge. Example- If you are a Rocky Horror fan, or Blues Brothers, or so many other movies that I can't even begin to create a list, you will LYAO at so many scenes. I have had to rewind once or twice to get these pop-art quips. This dialogue is fast-paced. Certainly not for the zombies that watch nothing but \\"reality\\" shows, or movies that attract 13 year-old boys.<br />This show has great paid actors (aside from Mr. Guttenberg...WHY??). But the main credit goes to the GREAT writers (that obviously had a great time writing the show...then wondered why mentioned \\"actor\\" was hired to speak their lines).<br />But the writers of this show deserve most of the credit here, for why this show is so great, in my opinion. You won't find this quality often.<br />Honestly, one of the best shows I have seen in quite some time, and very deserved of all the high praise you already see here.<br />1st season, the best.<br />2nd suffered with finale, but still better than what else was out there.<br />3rd wonderful.<br /><br />You are nuts if you don't buy it.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner begins in an elevator, where we meet our protagonist, Thomas, as he is lifted into the world of the Maze. Thomas knows little about who he is, where he is and why he's there, and as the reader we follow the next few days from his perspective as he learns the mysteries (and dangers) surrounding the Maze.    It is made clear to Thomas that he is different from all the other boys in the Glade, the compound within the Maze. The boys, for there are no girls or adults in this environment, are left to their own devices and have diverted from the path of \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" type chaos, instead forming a hyper-structured society with clear designations between roles and privileges. Thomas, with his barrage of questions, frustrates, inspires and angers the boys who have worked hard to keep their lives on an even keel by keeping their noses down.    His difference is further compounded when a girl is next to be brought into the compound, holding a note that says, \\"I am the last one ever.\\" The status quo of the compound is thrust into activity as they try to figure out what this means for their way of life, and Thomas finds himself front-and-center of the upheaval as the boys look to him for a solution and blame him for the trouble. He and the girl both appear to be catalysts, an instinct that proves to be accurate.    The plot of the book moves quickly between each development and keeps the reader interested in the process of learning about the Glade and its inhabitants. Thomas is a good narrator and asks questions the reader would be wondering about -- have they solved the maze? is there an exit? how do they get food? -- but his emotions are often difficult to follow. He becomes very upset every time someone tells him \\"I don't know,\\" but this is the answer he frequently receives. The boys have never questioned much about their life, and seem genuinely baffled when Thomas rages at them.     *** Spoiler Alert ***    My primary disappointment with the novel is that the ending revealed it to be merely a set up for the next novel in the series. The Maze Runner was a gripping story to read through, but it does not feel like a complete novel because of the resolution, or lack thereof. The cliffhanger is heavily done, and no further clues are given about the world outside the maze. Mr. Dashner seems to mete out hints about this world like they were the last seeds on a barren planet, and it is often frustrating. I finished this book without having answers to any of the major questions the plot created -- I only know who placed the boys there.     I would recommend this book, but it may be one you wait to read until the other segments are completed. I hope that will make it a more complete and satisfactory journey into this dystopia.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|I bought series 1 on DVD and loved it, so for a few bucks more I bought series 2 on Blu Ray.<br />Amazing transition, in terms of picture quality and audio; and series 2 was even better than<br />series 1 into the bargain.

B0039OGGVQ|4.0|I was truly expecting nothing from this.  Neat idea, but I don't know, s it's a new Velvet Revolver album, I wasn't really interested.  And on first listen, it was \\"okay.\\"  By the third listen I was hooked.  And surprised - if you'd told me that a Fergie song would be one of my faves, I'd say you were crazy - but it is.<br /><br />Much like any other album, there are some skippable tunes (Kid Rock), but with such a great array of singers you get some more interesting stuff than I'd thought I'd get. But man, some of this is really great.<br /><br />\\"Ghost\\" - I've said for years that Ian Astbury should be Velvet Revolver's new lead singer and this is a perfect example of why.<br />\\"Crucify the Dead\\" - how can you not love Ozzy?<br />\\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" - like, what?  I love a Fergie song?  The world is spinning in a strange direction.<br />\\"Back From Cali\\" - GREAT rocker.<br />\\"Promise\\" - I love Chris Cornell and this song almost makes up for his last solo album.<br />\\"Doctor Alibi\\" - one of the best on the album.<br />\\"Watch This\\" - THIS is Slash.

0385523386|5.0|At 23, Piper Kerman graduates from Smith College, completely at loose ends. Somehow she gets caught up with some people who are involved in smuggling drugs. She doesn't do much; she carries a suitcase of money here and there. She gets involved with another woman. Eventually she comes to her senses and gets out of the life. In a way, she rehabilitated herself.<br /><br />Fast forward ten years. Piper now realizes her lesbian fling was just that; she's straight. She gets a good job and falls in love with a wonderful man. Then there's a knock on the door, followed by years of legal bills, culminating in a year in prison and testimony against someone who she apparently didn't know.<br /><br />Piper was named by a former associate, because the legal system rewards those who come up with names. She was charged with a group of people, which meant that she could be responsible for the larger crimes even though she herself was involved in a tiny subset of their world.<br /><br /> After pleading guilty, she waited another six years to begin her prison term. Eeven though her sentence was 15 months (slightly reduced for good behavior), her life was tied up because the government wanted her to testify against another drug dealer.  Toward the end of her sentence, she spent time in horrific prisons, moved around for the convenience of the government through the infamous \\"Con Air.\\" Why? She was testifying about a man whom she had never met. To do this she had to go to Chicago. The prison transport system assumes everyone is a dangerous murderer who is desperate to escape.<br /><br />I found the circumstances of Piper's incarceration even worse than the reports of her prison experience. She eloquently captures the day to day grind of prison life, followiong in the path of Jean Harris (who was in a state prison, not federal). I don't agree with those who say she has no humor; she has a dry sense of irony.<br /><br />The biggest irony is that the justice system doesn't have to be just.  And then there's the waste of resources. We don't have money to save sick children, but we never run out of funds to exact meaningless vengeance on people who took a wrong turn, not realizing what they were getting into. We punish people at great expense years after they've left crimes behind.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book comes when Piper writes to Joe Loya, author of another book about prison life. I heard Joe speak at a reading in New York many years ago. I'm not surprised that he reached out compassionately and eloquently to help Piper.<br /><br />I'd like to know more about how Piper adjusted back into ordinary life. She seems to have had a job waiting for her as well as this book deal. Apparently she married Larry, who seems worth waiting for. And that's a final irony to the justice system. As more people get incarcerated for reasons that seem more related to \\"the system\\" rather than to their own moral defects, prison comes to seem more like a brutalizing experience than a stigma...more like being sent arbitrarily to a sadistic concentration camp. Ultimately it's hard to tell who's really guilty and who's innocently caught up in some bizarre sadistic scheme.urces.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I was so tired of all the Twilight & True Blood vampire frenzies going on that when this show first came out I immediately threw out any ideas of enjoying it. However, a few weeks later it was on TV, there was nothing to watch and so I left it on. I have been hooked ever since! This show is absolutely nothing like Twilight or any other vampire related show/movie. The characters and storyline are so well developed that you can't help but tune in for what happens next! The actors do such a wonderful job of giving life and personality to their characters, who all have their own issues and secrets. Although the idea of vampires is unbelievable, the show does so well with incorporating the vampire aspects into the story that it seems almost natural to believe it! And what I like the most, is this show has other parts to it besides the vampires...we see relationships between families & friends as well. Like said before me, Elena does not fall in love with Stefan because he is a vampire, its completely opposite. The fact that Stefan is a vampire often poses as a problem for their relationship...which I loved because it gave it that \\"real\\" factor. The entire history created within the show's town and characters is also very well constructed. You can just tell how much effort and thought is put into every aspect of this show. It will leave you desperate for more, and there is always a twist!     IMO the first few episodes aren't amazing, but I started watching it around episode 4. I eventually went back to watch the previous episodes, which although aren't breathtaking, are vital to the development of relationships in the show.     This show is a breath of fresh air and I have not missed an episode since I started watching it! I even bought them on I-tunes. Its very addicting and everyone I have recommended it to has instantly been hooked (including my mother, sister and friends). Buy it!
0316069906|5.0|The book Eating Animals provides information about which all who purchase food or go to restaurants must read.  We underestimate the power of our dollar vote every time we select something to eat.  The animals are considered food and the efficiency in which they can be processed and delivered to our table at a cost effective price is paramount.  Our food is not longer the food of our grandparents and great grandparents.  For non-vegetarians, this book is even more important.  It does not convince or try to convince anyone not to eat meat.  It merely requests that we know the steps and processes taken from birth to our stomach.  This book is shocking and revealing.  It is a must read and it will change your life.  It is about decency.  It is about more than just caring for animals.  It is about eating the food you enjoy with a clear conscience and knowing that the food is clean and fresh in all ways.    Read this book and tell your friends.
0240810961|4.0|This book is a wonderful surprise. Walt Stanchfield's lessons have been transcribed so that you get his voice speaking to you form across the years - and what an inspiring voice it is!<br /><br />I expected great lessons in Disney style drawing and animation and I got those - in abundance! How life would have been different if I'd had these lessons in squash and stretch and drawing the gesture (\\"Draw the verb in front of you, not the noun!\\"). But the real treasure is how he goes beyond the drawing lessons into lessons about how to be creative, how to live life!<br /><br />Sometimes it's about inspiring you to draw: \\"...Whether your heart is set on the fine arts or on animation, quick sketching is the shortest route to training yourself for capturing those spontaneous gestures and poses that are so essential to good drawing. Break one of your bad habits today. Which one? The habit of not sketching.\\"<br /><br />Other times he goes beyond this: \\"You must create. The injunction of life is to create or perish. Good physical and mental conditioning are necessary to do this. Remember this: the creative energy that created the universe created you, and its creative power is now in you, motivating you, urging you on - always in the direction of creative expression. I have a formula: \\"Impression minus expression equals depression.\\" This is especially applicable to artists. We have trained ourselves to be impressed (aware) of all the things around us, and in the natural course of our lives those impressions cry out to be expressed - on paper, on canvas, in music, in poetry, in animated film. So shape up!\\"<br /><br />Allow yourself to be inspired again - buy yourself this and the companion volume!

B000MG1ZGA|5.0|LA WOMAN is a GREAT album. Great musicianship and fantastic singing from Jim Morrison; his husky vocals fit the blues songs like a glove. Listening to \\"Been Down So LOng\\"; you KNOW Jim Morrison has been going through some rough times. STILL, he could make you listen. As for \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\"; easily one of the best blues songs I have ever heard. The Doors were notorious for experimenting with \\"Acid Rock\\" sounds and weird lyrics. Yet, underneath the \\"I am the Lizard King\\" exterior was a blues band that could rival and surpass ANY of the blues legends. Besides the Blues, we have the classics; \\"LA Woman\\", \\"Riders on the Storm\\", and \\"Love Her Madly\\". \\"L'America\\" is a creepy tripped out song that works on all levels. Gotta love \\"The Changeling\\" and \\"Hyacinth House\\". Only Jim Morrison could get away with reciting poetry on \\"WASP(Texas Radio)\\".He gets away with everything brilliantly; I love that song. The Doors are legendary; they could play blues and they could play their inventive tripped out \\"acid rock\\" sound. Either way, the fans won and they are still winning to this day.
B002BSHXJA|1.0|Beware of counterfeits! I purchased a \\"new\\" box set from a marketplace dealer and received a counterfeit set. I returned it with no problem and bought a \\"new but used\\" set from Amazon Warehouse Deals and got a genuine set. I recommend only buying from a reputable dealer. Google \\"beatles counterfeit box set\\" to see more complaints.     Now for a review of the CDs.     It's really cool to hear the albums as they were originally recorded by the Beatles.  There are many subtle differences in all of the mono albums when compared with the stereo, but Sgt. Pepper's and Magical Mystery are the most different. My 2 channel stereo cost me a few thousand bucks and the thing I noticed is that the treble on the mono set is muffled when compared to the remastered stereo. Even though they are mono, it shouldn't mean low-fi, just 1 channel. Maybe it was the mixing techniques the Beatles used during editing, but the cymbals and higher guitar notes are slightly muted. It's not that they sound bad, just not as detailed. With the remastered stereo versions the treble remains intact and I have no idea why.      I've listened to these for a few weeks, but when I listen to Beatles albums in the future I will probably listen to the stereo versions for nearly all albums. The subtle differences in most albums isn't big enough to make me want to listen to only the mono versions. However, Sgt. pepper's and Magical Mystery are better in mono (Magical Mystery actually has the best sound quality out of all the mono albums). I was really disappointed with Rubber Soul in mono since the remastered stereo version's sound quality rivals some modern recordings. The White Album was also disappointing, but it comes alive in stereo.  In the car, mono versus stereo makes NO difference. Either sounds fine. I doubt that the muffled treble is audible on a boom-box, a home theater in a box, or when converted to MP3s.     It's neat to hear the Beatles albums as they were intended by the Beatles, but what's amazing is how close the stereo engineers copied the mono's arrangements, takes, and timing of the mixes. I bet the mono and stereo versions are 98-99% the same takes. To make it more like old times, I set the balance control to only play music on one channel. I think it actually sounds better that way rather than having 2 channels play identical music. I'm not really sure if I recommend the mono box set. I guess it depends on how much you love the Beatles's music.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I bought this CD without an expectation, I was there in the 80's when Gn'R came out but those years have been long gone and have not followed Slash all that closely. It is good to see that Slash has evolved and is not affraid to venture into different territory. I found most of the songs on this CD quite tasteful and well arranged, I am not a fan of Fergie and cringed when I saw Adam Levine's name but it turns out Adam delivers the song incredibly well.<br />Don't get me wrong, my favorite song is still Doctor Alibi with Lemmy, as I am mainly a rocker but I am really pleased with this record as a listener and as a guitarist.<br /><br />You just can't have an 80's mullet forever you know? at some point it started looking ridiculous.
B003405MF6|5.0|I read somewhere Jeff comparing this record to Blow by Blow... and he was not fooling. This is one his best albums EVER, if not THE best. The fantastic studio efforts of the 1990s and on were merely a search compared to this GREAT find and the arrival. Buy this record and thank Jeff later!
B0035V35PI|5.0|Movie is awesome. I will leave it at that.    The blu ray... I mean why the hell do I even own this? Why did they make cds, dvds, blurays.... We are still in the vhs world. Tons of freaking previews and NO, you can not skip them! Not the second time you watch, not ever!     On top of the crap previews that you can't skip, one of the previews shrinks down to a smaller size as it is not 720 or 1080... WTF? This blurry piece of crap preview that I am forced to freaking watch!
B0002O06NA|4.0|I recently ordered this album and received it just a few days later.  The songs are great and I have been pretty happy to have the record on vinyl.  However, the package the item was shipped in was about 1/4 inch too narrow and instead of using a larger box or even putting it on an angle, the record was pushed down into the box.  Although the record was not damaged, the case and sleeve were damaged: bent and creased.  Customer service offered a small refund or to exchange for a new product...still I am disappointed in how they packed something as fragile as a record.
B000YABYLA|3.0|Juno, the tale of a smart teenager who finds herself pregnant and decides to give her baby up for adoption, features some very strong acting by the leads and supporting cast. The story is well-structured. Juno's parents are particularly strong, fairly believable, and likable. The boyfriend, with his corpse-white legs in his hideous yellow running shorts and what-just-went-past-me? expression, has an authentic sort of dweeby charm. So I gave it three stars.     But . . .    The script tries way too hard to be cool. I'm shocked that it won an Academy Award. If people in movies talked the way people talk in real life, movies would be incredibly boring, but this script is so filled with clever remark after clever remark that it gets tiresome in a different way. It's as if the whole thing is made up of things you wish you'd said an hour after you're out of the awkward situation.    I did not find Juno's character to be like any teenage girl I've ever experienced, and I've been one and raised one, so I'd claim at least a modicum of expertise. She reminded me of Calvin in Calvin & Hobbes. While things about her are teenager-like, just as things about Calvin are little-boy-like, she is not recognizable to me as a real teenager any more than Calvin is recognizable to me as a real little boy. The script rather than Ellen Page's performance is at fault. Based on Juno and Hard Candy, Ms. Page is a reason to see just about any movie.      The cute little indie songs are extremely annoying.      Finally, you can't really talk about the movie without talking about the pregnancy. Juno made an admirable and intelligent choice given her circumstances (closed adoption with the baby going to a loving home and Juno going on with her journey to adulthood unencumbered by an infant). Nonetheless, the movie cheated for the ban-all-abortion contingent by making the abortion clinic horrifically gross and grungy, and even more so by making Juno's delivery look like it took about five seconds and she barely broke a sweat.     Worth a look, but I wouldn't buy it or rent it again.
B0016OOS16|3.0|The product works well.  It is well built, and works well with Solidworks.  Because this is lighter than the other models it can be accidentally moved if you push or pull to hard in any given direction.  Most of this is completely acceptable as the bottom has a very nice rubber bottom that keeps it in its spot given that the rubber does not get dirty.       The reason for 3 stars - This is a notebook accessory - it is designed to be taken with you.  That being said, the case they give you is made of a shedding fabric that gets the bottom rubber dirty.  Obviously a major screwup on their part.  The bottom can be cleaned with windex, but otherwise is rather difficult to clean if you don't have chemicals and a non shedding cloth available at your disposal.  Forget about using the device with a dirty bottom - do yourself a favor and ditch the case.

B002ZG977Y|5.0|The much-antivipated remake of \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" roared into theaters in 2-D and 3-D, and it more than lived up to my expectations. The story from the first movie has been expanded thoroughly, and given a few twists that would make Zeus proud. Sam Worthington (\\"Terminator: Salvation\\") was perfectly cast as Perseus, as was Gemma Atterton as Io, Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades (interestingly, this movie marks the first time Neeson and Fiennes have been on screen together since Steven Spielberg's epic drama \\"Schindler's List\\"). Everyone was st to a perfect T in this film. The music is nothing less than epic. The 3-D effects are AWESOME. I've only a few minor quibbles: for one thing, I noticed that several scenes in the trailer (including one where Andromeda says to Perseus, \\"This isn't your fight\\" and he replies, \\"Someone has to take a stand\\") were cut from the movie. Secondly, I was disappointed that Medusa didn't speak in this versio (though the additonal screaming was perfect). Thirdly, I would have liked a flashback, showing Medusa before Athena transformed her into the creature we see in the temple (she was still beautiful until she screamed; I had no problem with her still being beautiful, though). Fourthly, and lastly, the film could have been about 30-60 minutes longer, with some more character development.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|Maybe they made an update to the product (bought April 2010). But I play COD Modern Warfare2 and these headphones are awesome. Sound quality is really quite good and setup couldn't be easier.    Note* I am NOT using the analog inputs so do not know the noise level or the output mixing level of this input. Am only playing Xbox360.    I was concerned reading the negative reviews but went ahead and got them anyway. Here is what I have found compared to the negative reviews:    Hiss and loudness: I dont get ANY hiss. Even when turned up loud. If I go to max then maybe there is something but why would I have them that loud anyway? Am using the optical input and they go plenty loud enough!    Sync problems on turn on: One guy said he had to pretty much re-pair them every time he turned them on. Not my set. One button push and I am done.    Unequal loudness one ear compared to the other: Nope.    Plastic toylike feel: Well, yes. This could be a lot better. For something that performs this well, they should bump up the aesthetics and feel.    Crackle and break up: About once an evening I hear a crackle. This is standard interference stuff and I am in an area with a lot of WiFi networks. So considering, this is great performance. I think the frequency hopping does a good job.    Dolby virtual surround doesn't work: This is person dependent. With some people it works great, others so so (all to do with the shape of your ear). I have always been on the so so side. But with this set it actually does seem to give a good effect for me. Is it as good as a full set of speakers, of course not. But its good enough for me for a simulation of some directionality in the surrounds.    My own negatives, none really except the ear-cups could be a bit bigger. Maybe I just have big ears!  4 stars given, not 5 only because of the look and feel.

It doesn't matter who he gets to sing to his songs, this music is just average. Some were good enough foot tapers but thats about it. Congrats on the cd but this sound has been made already, too common. I personally though chinese democracy was more creative than this but it wasn't that good either.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|(Edited: The price has already gone down slightly so it's slightly more worth it.)

B002ZCY7PU|5.0|i found out about Chuck through mindlessly trauling through the tv shows available in itunes australia. i read a couple of the reviews, took a punt with my hard earned 3 bob & bought the 1st 3 episodes including the pilot. i don't buy dvds of tv shows but i made an exception with Chuck after watching said 3 episodes & have not regretted it in the slightest, especially as you need to have cable to watch Chuck here in sydney.     put simply, it is the best bloody thing on the box & i watch a lot of box. my reasons are threefold: great ensemble cast who play well thought out characters, superb story lines with just enough plot twists to keep viewers on the edge of their seats but not alienate new fans &, above all, the perfect combination of action, drama & comedy. yes, folks, i've turned into a Chuckoholic...it's just that good.    i've had to make do with watching season 3 on-line like many fans outside the US & can happily say the show's producers, josh schwartz & chris fedak, have taken it to a new level. all our favourites are back along with some new ones, both good & evil or possibly both.    i just hope nbc give them the thumbs up for a 4th season. if not, i'll happily don my 'save chuck' singlet all over again...

B001ECQ4HG|5.0|True Romance is a story written by the outrageous and wonderful Quintin Tarantino. Unlike his other famous films, this one is not directed by him, but the director does a great job of staying true to what can only be described as the \\"Quintinized\\" way of story telling. I love this movie. And anyone who appreciates the way Quintin writes poweful, strong, butt-kicking women, will appreciate this tale as well. Gary Oldman has a fabulously bad boy role in this movie and he's irresistable as the bad guy. This film is rich with colorful characters and the music is perfect. This film is as close to perfect as they get. Renting it is a waste of money and time, because after seeing it once, you'll run right out and buy it. Save yourself the time and BUY IT NOW.
0446563048|5.0|In Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose Tony Hseieh shares much of his background and his rise to personal and financial success. A self made millionaire by his early twenties Tony's story is a fascinating read.<br /><br />Ever the entrepreneur Tony had a number of businesses as a child including lemonade sales, worm farming and button making. Eventually he graduated from Harvard, built and sold Link Exchange for millions of dollars, ran Zappos which sold to Amazon in a deal valued at $1.2 billion and so much more.<br /><br />The premise of the book underlies that Tony feels that the framework of happiness can result in both passion and profits.<br /><br />Tony seems to make very good friends and keep them throughout his life as both business partners and friends.<br /><br />Tony's energy and enthusiasm radiate throughout the book and it is good to see that someone who has achieved as much as he has at such a young age knows the value of the important things in life.<br /><br />Interestingly when I mentioned to my pop singing daughter that I was reading the book she told me she had tweeted him a few times and he had very nicely tweeted her back. For someone with hundreds of thousands of friends on Twitter that shows a real people person.<br /><br />Excellent read!<br /><br />~ Lee Mellott

B0033AX26I|5.0|One could simply listen to this CD and enjoy it for the beauty of the music and the various great talents who are part of it, But if you care at all about the human condition and the TRUTH then I would hope that it would lead you to do some historical research and discover that Iraq was not this country's first war of aggression and that conscientious objectors have been a presence in our inglorious history for a very long time.

B00004VXF2|5.0|I'll start things off here with some words from the late Lester Bangs, the world's greatest rock critic as well the world's leading expert on all things Lou Reed:    \\"In case you just got here or think METAL MACHINE MUSIC refers to something in the neighborhood of Bad Company, let me briefly explain that what we have here is a one-hour two-record set of nothing, absolutely nothing but screaming feedback noise recorded at various frequencies, played back against other noise layers, split down the middle into two totally separate channels of utterly inhuman shrieks and hisses, and sold to an audience that was, to put it as mildly as possible, unprepared for it.\\"    (From \\"How to Succeed in Torture Without Really Trying, or, Louie Come Home, All is Forgiven\\", reprinted in [[ASIN:1852427485 Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung (Five Star)]] by Lester Bangs; Edited by Greil Marcus; Knopf, New York, 1987)    Bangs later went on (in the hilariously hyperbolic \\"The Greatest Album Ever Made\\", reprinted in the same collection) to ennumerate the reasons WHY this made MMM so great (Reason #1: \\"If you thought feedback was the best thing that ever happened to the guitar, well, Lou just got rid of the guitars.\\") What it boils down to is that MMM is, among other things, a profoundly useful album. Want the world's greatest white noise generator? Here's your album. Want to rid your domicile of dawdling guests? Here's your album. Want, as Lester puts it, \\"the all-time guaranteed lease breaker\\"? Here's your album.    Here's the kooky part (as well as the part where I expect to lose about nine-tenths of my readers): I actually ENJOY LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. That's not to say I enjoy the same WAY as I enjoy, say, [[ASIN:B0025KVLRY With The Beatles (Remastered)]], but there are many different forms of enjoyment. I find it to be an amazingly cathartic experience. You know that line in [[ASIN:B0007DFJ0G Fight Club]] where the Edward Norton character talks about how after a night at FightClub, the volume seems like it's turned down on everything else in the world? MMM is kinda the musical equivalent of that.
B00275EGWY|3.0|To be perfectly honest, this movie tries a lot of things. It tries to be subversive, it tries to explore the psychology, it tries...alot. and it fails. Constantly.     It is entertaining, yes, but is it right in its entertainment? I don't know what turned me off first. the dialog that seemed to be written by a 17 year old dreaming about how it would be to be in combat, the plot that basically revolves around a team where one's bi-polar, the other keeps up his tough guy persona, and the other is...well...'dedicated'.    The things I like are the stars. David Morse is good(as he always seems to be) as the enthusiastic Colonel, and Ralph Finnes is great as the Private Contractor. Another thing is the actors. The actors help you ignore the whole screenplay, because their just good. Anthony Mackie overacts a little, Jeremy Renner underacts some, and Brian Geraghty acts really well, despite the horrible construction of his character.    I can pick out the scene I like the most, which is the PMC scene involving Guy Finnes. The combat itself is..well..dumb. The sniper scene however, does a great job of dwelling on the time. It's subtle, but you can tell that they've been out there for a long time. The subtle things aren't always that good, but when its done right(i.e. wrist watch scene in The Big Red one) You get the feeling that overall it makes enough sense.    However, the movies script is dribble. Mark Boal's writing deserves to be looked over by more than just himself, that is apparent. The line \\"Let's split up\\" Almost made me sh** laughing. That line had a Saturday morning stint of Scooby Doo written all over it. I don't like the authenticity of most of the costumes, for in all instances where the American Flag should be, is replaced with the logo of the company who made it. And finally, it's a liberal pipe dream. Now, I'm as middle of the road as you can get, but this, This isn't some sort of magical film that will help you understand the war any better. This film issimply an editorialization by a single man who's experiences are no longer objective, but have been twisted and molded into archetypal \\"subversion\\" film characters that every big psychological picture has.    I have more respect in the story telling sense for the HBO Mini-series Generation Kill, because rather than just doing everything on the fly like the Hurt Locker, The producers, directors, and the main writers all collaborated with the actual Marines for an elite status of authenticity that feels real. This, This, is more of what everyone would like to think of the War as. As some sort of psychologically comparable Vietnam.    If you can look at this movie, simply for its value as an action film set in Modern Day Iraq, Congrats. However, I would recommend watching the movie \\"The Messenger\\" and the Mini-Series \\"Generation Kill\\" over this otherwise.

1439153663|5.0|Let me tell you though that being about slavery this book is a stark reality of injustice and horrors that were committed from a time period where everything and everyone was the property of the dominant male, the land owner.<br /><br />The author did an astounding job at giving you everything you need to reach out and grab your senses and wring them like a wet rag. The storyline is very solid, very educational and one that I think would be a plus in the High School classrooms throughout the USA. This is a part of our history and not one I am proud of for sure but it teaches us that we are ever so much more fortunate to have the liberties and freedom's that we have today.<br /><br />I must say that I must have slept through part of history class because I was completely ignorant to the fact that there was white slavery that was no better than that of the African peoples. It seems immigrants were just as prone to the harsh realities of life even though they came looking for something better in a land that was supposed to offer Freedom and a better way of life.<br /><br />This was a book that I enjoyed immensely and I do hope you will give it a shot if you are looking for a good read that is something more meaty and not all fluff and puff.

B000RHKARY|5.0|In my opinion, this cd should be in the top 5 of all blues cd's. John Mayall is the father of the English blues and he really proves that he deserves the title, by his playing and the band he has chosen to back him up on this cd, The whole band is awesome, John's playing and singing is as good as it gets. Mick Taylor on lead guitar, plays guitar solos thru out the cd that are as good as any one I have seen live including Eric Clapton. This cd is the real stuff, with John and the band playing some great blues. Mick  Taylor, the lead guitar player. went on to join The Rolling Stones on a number of cd's, that is how good he is.If you really love the blues, this is the cd for you.
0441013597|4.0|I like books for different reasons - characters, writing style, exciting plot. I will remember \\"Dune\\" for its remarkable world-building.<br /><br />Dune (or Arrakis) is a desert planet. It is barren, almost waterless, and it is the only source of melange - a spice with unique geriatric qualities - it extends lives, enhances mental abilities, and is necessary for space travel. Dune is at the center of an Imperial scheme to bring down the influential House of Atreides led by Duke Leto Atreides. The plan is to give Leto the rights to extract spice on Dune, the rights that previously belonged to Atreides' century-long enemy - House of Harkonnen with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as its head. The feud between the Houses is later used as a cover-up for the extermination of the House of Atreides. This plan however has a flaw, as it doesn't take into consideration that Leto Atreides's 15-year old son Paul is not an ordinary child, but the end product of a long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human. It's Paul's destiny to give Dune back to its native people - Fremen and to upset the power balance in the Universe.<br /><br />Having finished \\"Dune,\\" I now understand why this book is considered to be for science fiction what \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is for fantasy - basically, it's a standard all other works in the genre are compared against.<br /><br />The world of Dune has an unprecedented depth to it. Herbert creates an entire culture built around the world that simply has not enough water. This planetary condition affects Fremen tremendously - they constantly wear stillsuits that are designed to conserve and recycle bodies' water emissions, dead bodies are processed to extract water, the population is controlled to accommodate the a total amount of water available. I found this world extremely interesting and well thought out.<br /><br />The concepts of Bene Gesserit (a school of mental and physical abilities whose hidden mission is to advance humanity through various genetic manipulations), Mentats (people trained for supreme accomplishments of logic, human computers), Missionara Protectiva (a wing of Bene Gesserit order whose goal is to plant superstition on primitive worlds to later make these regions easier for the order to manipulate), etc. are equally fascinating.<br /><br />The depth of the world, however, is the biggest weakness of the book as well as its biggest strength. It takes a while to figure out various concepts and terms which are introduced early on (thankfully, there is a very helpful glossary at the end of the book). The narration is a little too dry at times, especially when characters' mental abilities are explored. The book is in many ways happens inside people's minds, so there is a lot of thinking and analyzing involved.<br /><br />But these negatives aside, \\"Dune\\" is rightfully called a masterpiece of science fiction. It is much more that a story about aliens and space travel, it is an ambitious philosophical work which explores the issues of ecology, cultural identity and the nature of religious leadership. Although I am not sure I will read the rest of the books in the series (as far as I know the total book count is now 16), I will always remember \\"Dune\\" as an impressive work of literature which will definitely stand the test of time.<br /><br />P.S. I also watched David Lynch's movie adaptation of the book. My advice - spare yourself, DO NOT watch it.us genetic manipulations), Mentats (people trained for supreme accomplishments of logic, human computers), Missionara Protectiva (a wing of Bene Gesserit order whose goal is to plant superstition on primitive worlds to later make these regions easier for the order to manipulate), etc. are equally fascinating.<br /><br />The depth of the world, however, is the biggest weakness of the book as well as its biggest strength.

031606792X|4.0|After devouring the first three novels in the Twilight series, I was eager to read the fourth and final book. The first 200 pages or so were very odd- they seemed to be written by a ghost writer as the dialogue and plot were so vastly different from the other books... So as not to give anything away, I will say that once you get past the inital 3rd of the book, it gets really good. The author did a brilliant job of introducing new characters and pulling together the plot in an adventurous way. I liked Breaking Dawn and look forward to seeing how this book will be interpreted into a movie.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie once I received it. It was very relaxing along with being funny as well as sad at times.   However I ordered this movie from Amazon.com on 3/13/10 and didn't receive it within a week. I thought that was entirely too long to wait for the DVD. As a result, a friend of mine who was going to be visiting that week came and went and neither of us got to see this film while she was here--very disappointing.

0060512806|3.0|Cryptonomicon is a fast-paced highly stylized tome that weighs in at around 1150 pages (for the mass market paperback version). Stephenson's prose, like always, is brilliant but I just can't give this book 5 stars, or even 4 stars. There are a few major kinks in this otherwise fantastic book.<br /><br />In a nutshell Cryptonomicon is a book that has up to four parallel storylines going for it. You have a storyline that follows Bobby Shaftoe - a haiku writing Rambo-esque all American Marine. Lawrence Waterhouse - a math and cryptology genius who has a helluva time remembering people's names. Goto Dengo - a friend of Bobby Shaftoe who happens to be a soldier for the Japanese army. And then you have Randy Waterhouse - a modern day computer geek who is the grandson of Lawrence. He is the systems expert for Epiphyte which is a company trying to setup a data haven in the fictional country Kinakuta (the only fictional location in the book if I recall). The stories for Bobby Shaftoe and Lawrence Waterhouse are set in World War 2 while the story about Randy is modern day. Goto Dengo's story is also set in WW2 but he shows up in the modern story as well.<br /><br />For the most part Stephenson does a masterful job weaving all of these threads together. Stephenson's prose is highly addicting making this book downright impossible to put down at times. So, why the beef? Why 3 stars? (I would give it 3.5, but not rounded to 4 - a pessimistic 3.5 I suppose).<br /><br />First, as other reviewers have pointed out: most of the characters seem to be exactly the same. Yes, each has their own quirk and unique background, but the problem is in the dialog. The way the characters talk is almost exactly the same, it ends up sounding more like Stephenson talking and less like the actual characters. The dialog is often funny and/or witty but at the same time it's all too similar.<br /><br />Second, the book is a bit too big for what it is. I'm not like some people who believe this book needs to be cut in half, more like 100-150 pages should be edited out. I do love Stephenson's digressions but sometimes they are a bit much. For instance, there's what has to be 25 pages dedicated to a single email that really doesn't offer much to the story. There are other instances where he could have trimmed the fat a bit (though I did love the infamous Cap'n Crunch digression!).<br /><br />Finally, the ending. I'm usually not picky about endings. A lot of people hated Snow Crash's ending but I found it satisfactory. Cryptonomicon though, it's just so abrupt. After 1150 pages you would expect a grandiose ending but instead a lot of threads are left abandoned and questions left unanswered. I was left wanting more, but not in the way that the book was so good, more in the way of \\"okay, so what happens next?\\" Maybe the 150 pages I mentioned earlier that should have been cut should have instead been dedicated to wrapping the story up.<br /><br />Stephenson is a master of carrot-on-a-stick writing. The storyline is constantly bouncing between the modern story and the WW2 story and oftentimes a chapter ends with a cliffhanger, keeping the pages turning. It's just too bad that when you finally get ahold of the carrot at the end of the book and shove it in your mouth it turns out to be a stick of dynamite instead.<br /><br />Still, even though I have substantial gripes about this book I recommend reading it. When I look back I have very vivid memories of a lot of great scenes. So no, this book isn't perfect, but it isn't garbage either. Check it out!-150 pages should be edited out.

B002ZCDR88|1.0|I was a huge fan of 10,000 Maniacs, and I thought The Wishing Chair was one of the best records of the '80's.  That album is fresh, upbeat and creative, and Joe Boyd's production gave it a folk/pop feel that hasn't been duplicated since.  Merchant's voice was young, exciting and joyful back then, and the fact that the other members in the band added so much to their trademark sound made the music what it was.    Merchant's music has become self-rightous and unnecessarily somber over the years.  Her voice has become a parody of itself in many ways, and a formerly subdued unflattering elitism is now shining through.  While I'm aware her last two efforts have been \\"personal projects\\", it has gotten a bit tiresome.

B00371QQ2U|3.0|As other reviewers have commented, the wait time for this Blu Ray to start is the longest I've ever encountered, but I'm a patient guy and it really wouldn't bother me if the quality of the transfer was great enough to make it worth the wait.  Unfortunately, the high definition experience wasn't worth a DVD upgrade.  Comparing this one to my DVD copy there IS a difference, it is clearer, but it's not THAT much clearer.  There were definitely a few moments where I felt the magic of 1080p, but for the most part it wasn't a life changing experience like many other Blu Ray transfers provide.<br /><br />What I don't understand is why this movie made in the mid 90's gets such a sloppy transfer while old classics made 50-60 years ago get stunning, brilliant upgrades.  [[ASIN:B002VWONB2 Casablanca [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B001UHOWWY The African Queen [Blu-ray]]] both absolutely blew me away as some of the best examples of how Blu Ray can completely transform a movie experience, I was really hoping this more recent favorite of mine would get the same treatment.. no such luck.<br />---<br /><br />So overall my review is that if you've somehow never seen Apollo 13 before, then you might as well watch this 15th anniversary Blu just because it is Slightly better than the DVD.  If you already own the DVD, though, don't think you need to upgrade right away.  I haven't watched the special features yet, so there might be some worth getting for, but as far as the movie goes the clarity upgrade is minimal.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I was a huge fan of the first BDS, and while this one was alot more over the top i enjoyed the comedy angle.
B003498SDA|5.0|Movie - 4.5    I'd only seen this movie once some odd years ago when it first came out on DVD. My mother had rented it, but my attention span and train of thought were so much different than it is now and I never really got into it. Since then, I've developed a greater appreciation for film-making in the way a movie is produced, who's cast in the roles, and especially the way it's written. After sitting down a few months ago to finally watch the entirety of Heat, I discovered the gritty magic of one Michael Mann for the first time. Needless to say, he strikes another excellent effort in Collateral. Unlike Heat with its extensive run time and extremely fleshed-out characters, Collateral is surprisingly spectacular in that it manages to achieve almost the same effect, but with a shorter, more truncated time frame. From the get-go we're thrown into the \\"world\\" known as Los Angeles where disconnect and sprawl are the very fabric of this bustling, yet sad city, in which we meet Max (Jamie Foxx), who unknowingly will have his life changed forever within the next few hours. Enter Vincent (Tom Cruise), who does the changing in cold, calculated, and stylized fashion. Spoilers aside, this is a movie that illustrates many a good point about life in general. L.A. represents the void that is our lives, Max is the everyman who just can't over the hump in that void, and Vincent symbolizes aspiration, change, and adaptation to counteract it all. The script, acting, and screenplay are amazing, thanks in huge part to the chemistry and acting abilities of Cruise, Foxx, Pinkett Smith, and even Ruffalo. It's a film that shows how even the most polar opposite of personalities can somehow come together through all the crap in the world, if not for one night, and create something that will stay with them for the rest of their lives and break them out of a rut.    Video - 4.5    With a good 85% of the film being shot in HD, Collateral looks excellent all things considered. Colors aren't toovibrant, and there's a fair amount of noise throughout. But if you take into account that pretty much the whole movie takes place either in the dark or in dimly-lit locales, it's understandable.  Black levels are still rich, detail is fine, and the contrast never wavers, even in the darkest of scenes. I was especially impressed with the techniques they used in filming the cab scenes to get all the camera angles.  As dark and dim as it really is inside a cab, the clarity is actually quite striking.  What few scenes there are with lighting have a gritty sheen to them as well.  When you actually put some light on Foxx and Cruise, colors look much better, flesh tones more natural, and details a great deal sharper, particularly in Cruise's stubble and hair texture.  Overall, the look of the film itself makes for a very nice transfer.  Aesthetically it's not something you could showcase as being reference, but it's a commendable job by Paramount, nonetheless.    Audio - 4.5    The DTS-HD 5.1 track doesn't amount to much in the beginning, as a lot of the movie is dialogue-heavy, at least until Vincent is introduced. Dialogue, by the way, is crisp and clear emanating through the center channel with no traces of dropout or distortion. However when Vincent starts doing his work, the sound field becomes much more thoroughly engaged. General sound effects like walking on the pavement, the taxi doors, radio calls, and background noise are all very buoyant. Music does an adequate job coming from the front sides as well and adds a good deal of sporadic immersion to keep you engrossed. All of these elements are fine and dandy, but it's the wallop of gunshots amongst the chaos that really give the system a workout later on. As far as I'm concerned, the audio for how it's used in the movie is a perfect transfer.  As a BD, though, I just wish the side speakers got a little more usage and that LFEs were more frequent.    Extras - 4.0    While the making-of featurette is interesting, the real star of the extras is the exceedingly informative commentary by director Michael Mann. Mann does a stellar job explaining technical terms of how he filmed the movie, fills in some of the information gaps of the characters and their backgrounds, and then delves into the symbolism of their actions and presence. It serves as a great compliment to the narrative of the film itself and really has the ability to raise one's appreciation for the overall work. The making-of featurette elaborates a little on what Mann mentions in the commentary, only with pictures and video. I actually liked the bit with Cruise's training sessions a lot and found it to be a testament to how good of an actor he is (personal issues aside). However, I did find some of the making-of stuff to be a little repetitious of what Mann said already, leaving a little more to be desired. The commentary, though, is a must-listen for fans of the movie.    Overall - 4.5    Collateral is an extremely well-constructed action/drama/thriller.  It's a film that offers a good dose of grit and realism through a very charismatic Tom Cruise and equally subtle Jamie Foxx. It's a story that sort of goes against modern conventions with its truncated time frame of a narrative, but regardless, manages to tell a very entertaining story about two seemingly opposite strangers in a \\"world\\" where feeling unfulfilled is the norm, and then clashing their ideals into something more worthwhile. Presented by Paramount with near-reference A/V quality and an informative set of extras, Collateral comes highly recommended.

B0035G9ABQ|3.0|After two listens, I have personally determined that the absence of Danger Mouse's production has left this collection feeling like it is missing something. Not a bad collection of songs, but while Demon Days had a dark apocalyptic undercurrent flowing throughout, this comes off more clean and safe. I am also distracted by the presence of too many guest vocalists....the tracks with only Albarn seem to really hit the mark, but the constant change up of other voices makes this Beach play like a compilation instead of a cohesive album. It is an overall good and entertaining album, but for me it is another example of the impossibility to replicate greatness. This Plastic Beach could have used a little more Demon....and a little more Mouse.

B000S1M9LY|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever, and I'd love to have a Kindle version to go along with my two dog-eared copies. But there's no way I'm shelling out $17 for an electronic, DRMed copy of a book that has been out nearly 15 years now.    I realize the pricing decision wasn't Amazon's, and I'm sympathetic to the publisher's stated desire to price new release Kindle editions above the $9.99 price point and then bring them down in price over time (the record companies said they'd do the same thing with cds, and that never happened), but this makes me think that they are just trying to kill off the Kindle platform.    Buy the paperback - skip the Kindle version until the publisher prices it appropriately.

It intregues me to the point that I don't want to stop reading till the end.  It's the kind of book that you have to read every page to really get the intent of the story.  Makes you want to look ahead to see the end results, but the way it's storyline goes you can't do that.  I only have about 30 minutes a day to read so I am going slow.  It covers love, mystery, danger,lying,and excitement and even some supious events in some characters.  I was caught by the title, and I can't wait to see how The Forgotten Garden comes into the plot.  It talks of hidden castles, unknown homes in places across the sea to Europe, fairy tales, and a mystery writer that may have a lead to the background of the characters life.  A very well written story, and a must read.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I think everybody should watch this documentary and then make up their own mind.  Some of this is not new of course (how the animals are treated) but other information is mind boggling, like the farmers not being able to save their seeds?  How can something like this happen?  Anyway - watch it and see for yourself !!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Fantastic story - not just the run of the mill mystery. Enjoyed the political and social commentary woven throughout the book. Well worth the read.

B001AR4K8K|4.0|Jason Patric, Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Haim and Corey Feldman star<br />in this 1987 horror film. Two brothers and their mother move to a<br />town full of vampires.  This is one of the best vampire films and<br />I'm glad to have it on blu-ray that has nice picture and sound<br />plus neat extras. I recommend this good blu-ray of this 80's<br />horror classic.

B000WC3864|5.0|Bruce Campbell stars in Sam Raimi's 1981 horror film.  College friends go to a cabin and find an ancient book   causing demonic possession.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|A masterful tale of family secrets and unfulfilled dreams. Mortons weaves past and present recollections of a former Riverton employee into a compelling mystery  involving family secrets, unrequited love, and intrigue. A story that will leave you thinking about it long after you finish. Can't wait to read more of Kate Morton. i read this book after I read The Forgotten Garden and liked this one better.
B000099T3P|4.0|Dee Wallace Stone and more star in his 1986 sci-fi/  horror film. Lethal aliens terrorize a Kansas farm   family with a pair of intergalactic bounty hunters   on the trail. I've always enjoyed this film and like   the tranformation effects of the bounty hunters.   This dvd has nice picture and sound plus a neat   alternate ending and trailers for all 4 films. If you   enjoy great 80's sci-fi/horror, get this.
B00005JM02|1.0|The film itself is a wonderful, entertaining family film.  However the quality of the DVD that the film is on is very poor.     We were able to get to the MENU only once -the very first time we played the DVD.  We went to the extras to look at the \\"virtual aquarium\\" but we found the screen almost completely obscured.  Then we went to film itself and found that once the film starts playing, there is no way to pause, fast-forward,rewind, etc.  In fact it is impossible to get to the Menu until the film has finished.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh star in Alfred Hitchcock's<br />1960 thriller based on the novel. A woman steals money and<br />falls victim to an insane motel clerk. This is definitely one of<br />Hitchcock's best and Anthony was terrific as Norman Bates.<br />This 2-disc set has good picture and sound plus neat extras.<br />Get this classic.

B000R8YC1S|5.0|David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly star in Jim Henson's 1986 fantasy.  A girl wishes for her baby brother to be taken by goblins and must   rescue him from a goblin king. I've loved this film since I was a kid   and glad to have this anniversary edition that has nice picture   and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this fantasy classic.
0064407667|1.0|I'm surprised that this is a children's book. I mean it's filled with scenes of extreme child neglect, and manipulation. The issues in this book are very serious, death, grief, child abuse, etc. I would read this before, allowing my child to read it. Reading this is more like a sick punishment than for pleasure.
B002ZFQD0Y|5.0|I was happy with my purchase of the DVD. It was in new condition and arrived to my home quick!
0140157352|5.0|Look this book was first printed in 1981 so it represents the ideas and insights of the authors at that time. And the authors did really put a standard out there in 1981. As long as you keep that in mind, you will really appreciate this work as it explains the very basic concepts of negotiations. Lot of other negotiation books published are based on this classic in one way or another. It is the first book to read on negotiation so to speak.<br /><br />The Harvard Law School - Program on Negotiation (PON) offers by the way more in-depth negotiation training and workshops, some of them given by the same authors.<br /><br />Contents:<br />I The problem<br />1 Don't bargain over positions<br />II The method<br />2 Separate the people from the problem<br />3 Focus on interests, not positions.<br />4 Invent options for mutual gain.<br />5 Insist on using objective criteria.<br />III Yes, but...<br />6 What if they are more powerful?

0307463745|5.0|Whats great about this book is it isnt some how to get rich scheme. It's a easy-to-read, be real, know your job, get-it-done book.
0385504225|1.0|I was an avid fan of Mr. Brown. I enjoyed the early books so much I get into a frenzy when a new book is coming up. But alas. This last book has been my weaning bottle. From writing gems like Digital fortress, Deception point to this utterly mystical, shallow  mindless narrative, I wonder where he will go from here! Good bye Mr. Brown, and thanks for your early works, there was real Sci Fi in them.
0375831002|5.0|It is a rare book that can break my heart & reduce me to tears, but this is one such book. Set in WWII Germany through the eyes of a young german girl w/ Death as the narrator, it shows her foster family and friends' struggle to survive while trying to do the right thing down to the Jewish man hidden in the basement. The book has an important underlining theme of how words, written or otherwise, can make such an impact on lives and to choose them wisely.  Makes for a great book club read as it will spark heated conversations, opinions about war, and how many of the issues of that era can relate to today's issues.  Clearly written for a young adult audience, but still captivating for the adult reader.
B000002MNR|3.0|This has some great stuff, but just about all of it is in the beginning of the disc from the movie 'CAL'.  There are some other good tunes, but too few and too far apart on the disc. All of it is nice to listen to, I was hoping for more upbeat material or in lieu of that, more tunes like those from 'Cal'.  That stuff is great.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|What can one SAY \\"bad\\" about Jeff Lynne ??  NOTHING. The \\"guy\\" is a Musical Genius. Out Of The Blue, in \\"my\\" opinion, WAS his BEST Studio CD. Starlight, Summer and Lightening, Sweet Talking Woman,Across The Border...Just a Few names of GREAT!! songs on this Double CD.<br />WELL 'worth' the Investment.
0143144901|5.0|This is a brilliant story... It was fabulous to listen to. I would recommend this book to anyone!

0307463745|5.0|So simply, so true.   One of the best, no the best book about starting, developing and getting real in your company

0060833459|4.0|Drucker presents a very good case that many or most execs are not effective, or as effective as they could be.  He also reveals methods by which an executive can increase his/her effectiveness and contribution towards an organization.  Very good advice, written in Drucker's straight-forward manner.  It is an old book, originally written over 40 years ago, but the concepts are timeless.
B002VWOMN6|5.0|I'm new to Blu-ray having purchased a player recently. The first thing I did was order some of the \\"classics\\" that are my favorites. This movie is phenomenal anyway and on Blu-ray is even better. The colors and clarity just blow me away as compared to a regular DVD. If you love Mozart you have to get this movie. The music is wonderful.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|The greatest part of getting older is becoming a grandma! If this hadn't happened I never would have gotten to watch the Pixar movies and what could be better than watching them with a kid you love?  IMHO, \\"Ratatouille\\" is just another Pixar masterpiece. I would buy one without seeing any previews or knowing anything about the movie. That's just how much I have enjoyed everything they have created.
B000000H57|5.0|I just read today that Peter Steele has passed away.<br />October Rust was the only album of Type O's that I have purchased.<br />A great album from one of the most incredible frontmen in metal.<br />Be free and RIP Peter.........
B002P93VGO|5.0|Alright, first the movie. It's awesome. I used to collect all of the \\"X\\" titles from marvel when I was younger so I followed Wolverine for a long time. When the movies were released, I went in with an open mind, knowing full well that they were not going to be a rehash of the comics and I was glad about that. I think this \\"open mind\\" policy is quite important with comic book to movie adaptations. If you are not a comic follower, but you like some good action, then you'll still like this.<br /><br />As far as the Blu-Ray goes, it works great. The quality is awesome and combine it with a good, at-home theater system and you'll feel like you went out to the movies. Very much worthwhile.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I watched a portion of the film \\"FOOD,INC.\\" on the Oprah Show. It brought alot of questions out that had been worrying me just below the surface, for a while. Questions like, \\"why are chicken breasts so big now?\\", or \\"how healthy are the fruits and vegies I'm buying?\\", etc. So, I ordered this movie from Amazon.com, hoping to put to rest some of my inner fears; or at least, maybe hear some of the truth of what's out there. I was shocked,overwhelmed, and saddened by what I saw! I watched this film with my 24 year old daughter, and 26 year old son. We all stared at each other, and uttered things like, \\"are you kidding me?\\"! We all talked about it at length after it was over. Concerned that we had no idea what was going on, or how we were participating unknowingly!  The next time I went to the grocery store, I was paralyzed with fear of the unknown! I kept thinking, \\"how am I going to find healthy food to serve my family now? Holy Cow!\\"    This movie is very through, and doesn't use harsh tactics to get your attention. The subject matter is enough to do that. What it does is show just a good glimpse of what happening in the food production world that has taken over farming as we thought we knew it. American farmers have been taken over by profit hungry corporations. Most humane animal treatment has gone out the window, along with food as God intended it. We are now eating food that has been genetically, antibiotically, and hormonally altered to turn up the profits! I felt really ashamed for not knowing intuitively that something is wrong! America is the fattest nation on earth,so is there a chance that altered food is contributing to it? Things like High Fructose Corn Syrup? Corn fed cows? Really? Please don't take my word for it, just get this movie, and watch it for yourselves. It is definitely a \\"MUST SEE TO BELIEVE\\" experience. Watch with someone who's health you care about! And for your futures sake, read the labels on everything you buy!
B00003CXIP|5.0|I Love this movie, but movie bame packaged and with no scratches. Would purchase from seller again.
1439153663|5.0|If possible I would give this book 10 stars.  Once I began to read the book I couldn't put it down.  I was awake at 2:00 am the first night of reading and didn't want to stop although I had to go to work in a few hours.<br /><br />The author did an outstanding job describing slavery and how it affected everyone-the slaves, slave owners, the children, neighbors...  The scenes were described with such detail you could almost smell the foods cooking, see the trees and scenery, feel the pain the characters experienced.  No details were spared, good or bad.<br /><br />Kathleen Grissom is a truly gifted and talented Author.  I'm looking forward to and hoping to read more from her in the future.
0316069906|5.0|I just finished Eating Animals this morning and I have to say this book was profoundly disturbing but fascinating as well.  I have always been a Vegetarian wanna be;  I know that I will be healthier if I quit eating meat,  Vegetarians have about a 20% lower chance of developing cancer and probably heart disease as well.  Also the ethical issues are pretty hard to ignore, even if you eat only animals that are raised 'free range'.  I think if people had to watch peta videos of animals getting slaughtered immediately before they ate their meat, we would see a profound decrease in meat eating.  Anyway,  Read this book!!! I downloaded on my kindle for $12.99 but you can buy it for $17 or whatever and Amazon will get it to you in about a week or less.
B002OG5GT8|5.0|I got these to use with the Turtle Beach Ear Force XLC Stereo Headset with Mic (http://www.amazon.com/Ear-Force-Stereo-Headset-Xbox-360/dp/B002PXRXNW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1271336807&sr=8-1), which has an adapter to let you use the headphones directly with the XBox 360.  The adapter works, but has very little volume.  However, with this headphone amp, there's more potential volume than I can handle.  The bass boost works too.
0312356854|5.0|This was a book club read, and a wonderful choice.  I personally enjoy the flashback type of writing as the author brings the past and the present together.  Having just visited Paris 6 months before reading it, that also made the book more meaningful.  The historical events described are horrific and make one wonder what the human race is capable of, but hope springs eternal.
0756603749|3.0|I bought this book thinking it was exactly what I needed after reading the Booklist review on the page. This book is not aimed at sportsmen like the review implies, it is aimed at artists. I assumed I could look up knots by task, which was not the case; the knots are presented by type, which helps, but until you read the description of the knot, you won't know what to use it for and you still won't know whether it is the best knot for the task.  \\"Need a secure loop tied in the middle of a rope during your next camping trip?\\"  I will know what knot to use because of the review, but not this book. Further, the book spends a good deal of time on decorative knots, while not including (as other readers pointed out too) basic knots you actually use for the sports it recommends knots for. I would rate this book lower, but its not the book's fault the Booklist review seems to refer to a completely different book (knot just a non-updated edition) and the book does in fact have beautiful illustrations and easy to follow instructions.    If you want an afternoons entertainment learning about ropework, or to learn a couple fancy knots to impress your friends, this would be the book to use. If, like me, you need applicable knowledge of knots, get another book as I am going to have to do.
0061689246|4.0|a great read written by an original author. If you love fairy tales as a kid, you will love this book!
0385504225|1.0|I am at a loss to know why Dan Brown wrote this book, other than to secure another lucrative Ron Howard movie deal! It screams for a qualified editor and a plot coach. It is contrived, hackneyed, threadbare...and a hundred other synonyms for \\"Don't Waste Your Time and Money.\\" I wish I hadn't.    The spoiler is this: Read your Bible! How's that for an earth-shattering, science-debunking, religious-fanatical thrill-o-rama? If Langdon were HALF the healthy skeptic of Browns-past, he would've read through this treacle within the first half of the book! \\"The Lost Symbol\\" discredits Langdon, Brown, the Masons, science AND religion!    My suggestion: follow the advice of the Coen Brothers -- \\"Burn After Reading.\\"

B00006AW2G|1.0|This was effectively an LP between Brian Jones and Mick Taylor. They really did not have their trademark 2 guitar sound and Jimmy Miller really fails on the production side. Almost everything on the album is far better live. Gimmie Shelter, Midnight Rambler, Love In Vain all fair much better when they get worked out live with Mick Taylor on board. Midnight Rambler shows none of its potential in this studio version and Country Honk is sad filler at best not even a shadow of Honky Tonk Women with MT. Some good songs like You Can't Always Get What You Want which really is the theme of the LP since you don't get anything near the potential that might have been. A really sloppy and uneven album.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|[[ASIN:B0011V9XT6 The Beyonce Experience Live [Blu-ray]]]    Truly, BeyOnCe is the greatest performer I've ever watched. I own a lot of Concert DVD and I could say that this concert experience showed what the true entertainment is. From the Opening till the end she gave her best. The stage was really conceptualized to fit on each of the song and her personality, there were no dull performance. The Light Effects on the stage made the concert so Fabulous and Amazing and I think that's what made the concert Great. Another thing she doesn't forget where she came from, From being in a Girl group (Destiny's Child) and She still sang their hit songs, even though she has her own already. Personally my favorite prod here was the Get me Bodied, the routine impressed me lot, the costumes, the routines, her sexiness and her being artistic. So the Question is ARE YOU READY TO BE ENTERTAIN ??? Well if you want, grab a copy of this from Amazon !!!
0321344758|5.0|True to his title \\"Don't Make Me Think\\", Steve Krug has authored a visual and textual map, on web usability, like no other.

0316017922|5.0|I won't rehash the other synopsis reviews. I will however say this; I really enjoyed Malcolm's perspective and his ability to translate his observations and correlations to which yield success. I highly recommend this as a \\"weekend read\\".
B001PR0YGC|3.0|\\"The Informant\\" is a kind of theater of the absurd movie. It has a silly, frivolous musical sound track, and it has a tone to that is jarring; it's a serious subject dealt with a very off-handed manner. Throughout the movie Matt Damon as Mark Whitacre, looking like a nerd, is talking to himself in long voice-over monologues on topics that have nothing to do with the story. He's a head case who lies, probably suffers from bi-polar disorder, invents, forges, and lives in multiple universes. It's almost like a situation comedy gone berserk. The movie can't decide what it wants to be, and it can't find a tone that suits it.<br /> I found the movie to be annoying, disconcerting, and frivolous. I was reminded of two Russell Crowe movies, one about another whistle-blower (in the tobacco industry) and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" about a man with a serious mental disorder, both more serious and better movies.<br /> The Archer Daniel Midlands Company, the agri-industry giant, got itself in trouble with price fixing and other corrupt practices, and Whitacre, a company executive, became a whistle-blower. He allies himself with the FBI and wears a wire. Unfortunately they find out he's a pathological liar, and he himself is guilty of taking huge bribes ranging in the millions. Melanie Lynskey plays his wife and is like dumbbell naïve Georgette (Georgia Engel) on the Mary Tyler Moore show. Whitacre lives in a fantasy world.<br /> There are some funny incidents, but for the most part, it is a theater of the ridiculous movie that just doesn't click and have the right style.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I loved this dvd.  It was great watching the rehearsals and getting a real feel for behind the scenes.  Thank you.
B00004XONN|3.0|ehhh, this was too experimental. After OK Computer, this just went a little too far on the weird side. Thom Yorke sang way too much-a lot of the ambient music would have been fine without him howling in the background. Don't expect early radiohead with this one
B000N3ST7A|3.0|I had to wait a long time for this cd to arrive.  Still not sure if I like all the tracks on this cd as I think they remixed a couple of them.  It still takes me back in time with a singer that I really like!

Left with nothing but disability checks and time on his hands he creates a collection of miniature robots which he gives to his son. Upon the accidental destruction of the dominant leader robot, the remaining robots dissolve into waring factions. With a sharp mind for robotics, mathematics and Solomon-like wisdom, the robotics engineer is able to right the ship through low level code manipulation and diplomacy. He restores harmony to his colony of robots much to the delight of his son.    Strangely this film was animated, making it appealing for children only. Decent premise though.

B00328G4V6|5.0|By the time Jimi Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding commenced on an ambitious project to build upon the momentum from the incredible \\"Electric Ladyland,\\" change was definitely in the air.<br /><br />Producer Chas Chandler was fading out of the picture and Redding would soon be sent packing for bassist Billy Cox, as Hendrix was stretching the sound from a blues-rock power trio while attempting to bring revolutionary artistry to the lead guitar. Add to the tumultuous mix the beginning of the concert tussle between Hendrix - who was expanding his stage sound - and fans who often only wanted the hits, it was the beginning volley of what became \\"classic rock,\\" where musicians became trapped in their early success and degenerated into simply giving the same performances time and time and time again.<br /><br />\\"Valleys of Neptune\\" is the maturation of the expanding vision of Hendrix, while being a bridge to the future that was probably leading to the emerging trail of fusion. Strip down the tracks to guitar & drums and \\"hear\\" meticulous paints of various colors spreading over a vast - yet intimate - canvas; Hendrix and Mitchell take the listener on an incredible journey.<br /><br />The title track - with Hendrix, Mitchell, Cox and percussionist Juma Sultan - is the standout of the \\"new\\" concept, while Hendrix lashes out utterly wicked riffs on \\"Hear My Train a Comin'\\" and \\"Mr. Bad Luck.\\" The nod to Cream with \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" finds the Jimi Hendrix Experience covering familiar terrain, with some punch provided by percussionist Rocki Dzidzornu. Fresh interpretations of familiar numbers - \\"Stone Free,\\" \\"Fire,\\" \\"Red House\\" - provide a valuable compass, while a cover of the Elmore James classic, \\"Bleeding Heart,\\" and \\"Lover Man\\" have a sweet edginess. \\"Ships Passing Through the Night\\" and \\"Crying Blue Rain\\" are true rarities - even for the most cynical collector after so many years of inferior/embarrassing \\"new\\" releases and bootlegs - though \\"Lullaby for the Summer\\" is a well-known cut.<br /><br />Eddie Kramer does a masterful job with the mixes and John McDermott's essay in the picturesque booklet delivers historical - and indispensable - tidbits. Perfection is what Hendrix strived for....and it brings a bright rainbow that smiles with wonderful warmth in what just may be the 2010 Album of the Year.ut.

0061478784|5.0|I first read this as a college student, having seen and liked the anime-movie version - and I have to say, Howl's Moving Castle is the most enjoyable thing I've read in quite a while! To others who have seen the anime prior to reading the book: the book is quite different in all but basics (yes, it's still about a highly relatable girl named Sophie who is turned into an old woman, and becomes the housekeeper of a vain, histrionic, but entirely lovable wizard), there are many differences, such as Sophie's sister's playing a much larger role, minus the vague backdrop of war, and numerous delightful twists. But the biggest difference is this: clich&eacute; as it sounds, the book is BETTER!<br />I realize that it is a teen/tween book, but it has an enormous appeal for adults as well, on top of weaving fabulously complex, engaging characters into a highly exciting plot, it's also immensely funny, humor ranging from laugh-out-loud comedy, to subtle, almost Austen-esque wit sure to keep you smirking all throughout. Highly recommended for all ages.
B002JVWR9U|2.0|Geeze ... com'on CW - do you REALLY need to charge THAT much for a DVD (standard set)? Maybe if they didn't use so much music in these shows, the cost would not be so much! Love the show, but will wait till Amazon has a 50% off sale around the holidays!
B0018O4YSQ|2.0|I love science fiction and I love film noir. So as a film noir Sci-Fi flick, I thought I'd really like DARK CITY. But, not so much, unfortunately. The visuals are very nice. Actually, they're the best thing about the movie. Now that I think of it, they ARE the movie. They are reminiscent of the Hopper painting Nighthawks at the Diner. So let's put a star in the visuals box.<br /><br />Then there's casting/acting in DARK CITY. There is, literally, no star in that box. Mr. 24 himself, Kiefer Sutherland, plays a very poorly acted doctor. It's like he's impersonating Igor in every scene. William \\"Cardboard Man\\" Hurt actually almost works as the hardboiled detective, until you realize that his name is Bumstead. As in Dagwood Bumstead. Then it all falls apart, and you realize that this is the same actor playing the same character he plays in all his movies, from Alterted States forward. He makes \\"deadpan\\" seem downright festive. Then there's the lovely Jennifer Connelly. I'll be kind and say she's just wrong for the part, but she does manage to sing two songs fairly well. I'm guarded in my praise because one of the songs is The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, a great song to be sure, but she sings it as a slow cabaret tune. The problem is really that she seems far to innocent for the role of a cabaret singer. But compared to the headliner, Rufus Sewell, she's a dream.<br /><br />Mr. Sewell plays the part of a man who wakes naked in a bathtub with a murdered girl in the next room and plenty of clues that he did it, and it wasn't his first. He's also got...wait for it...AMNESIA. I don't really mind the tired old plot device, but honestly, amnesia? So he follows clues until something big happens at the end. Throughout DARK CITY, he seems to be perpetually startled. He never seems to come into his own, to actually inhabit the character until the very end. You could argue that is part of the story, but even as a man on the run, he wasn't very convincing.<br /><br />Then there's DARK CITY's plot. Oy vey! I'm having a hard time using the word ORIGINAL here except when preceded by UN-. There are quite a few famous stories with very similar plots or at least large sections of this plot. That wouldn't much matter if it all was executed well. For example, The Matrix, which was released the year after DARK CITY, was strikingly similar but vastly better executed. I'd watch the Matrix again, but not DARK CITY.<br /><br />To summarize, DARK CITY is a mess at every level. Despite middling ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and an interesting comparison in Wikipedia between DARK CITY and Plato's The Cave, I had a very strong negative reaction to the film. In addition to everything else I have described, I felt that the ending was a cop-out. Apart from the visuals, there really is nothing to recommend about DARK CITY.ey!

B0015XHP4K|5.0|I have to admit that I was thoroughly surprised on how good of quality First Blood is.  So far I have only watched the first movie, but judging that it is the oldest, the others will probably be just as good of picture quality.  I was kind of hesitant in buying these because of prior disappointments with older movies on blu ray, but these are very good.  There is very little grain, except in dark parts of the film.  Much better 1080p quality than Predator or Terminator on blu ray.  Stay away from those.  The Dvd version of those are just as good.  Anyway, these were a great deal getting them for $21 gold box deal.  I would highly recommend these to Rambo fans.
B0037W68F4|5.0|I bought the vinyl on the faith that this album would deliver. And it did, double-confirming MGMT's status (in my humble classic rock opinion) as the best thing that's happened to music since the Beatles or Floyd. Someone [sven209] on their site said it was \\"Almost as if early Pink Floyd made their first few albums with todays technology.\\" To that I might add with even better vocal harmonies.    With Vinyl as always, quality was excellent, but they split the record up into 4 chucks on 2 x 180g vinyls (for such a short album I don't know why). This provides for some interruptions in the music. I buy vinyls because they're nice to handle, but these were far from that. It is very difficult to cram 2 heavy and thick records in sleeves into one record cover. Plus, the record cover is just front and back, no fold out or anything. My roomates CD, on the other hand is really cool - it's fold out. There's also a booklet with some earthy-feel-good pictures and recording pictures and such, and it came with this coin that has parts mentioned in Flash Delirium.    In conclusion, definitely buy the CD, it's an amazing album. You might also buy the vinyl as well.
0451228731|2.0|The book was well written and the characters were well crafted.  However, I got the impression that the author was given a 2-hour deadline to finish the last 50 pages.  I was sorely disappointed with the book's climax and found that it made little sense and had no continuity with the original plot; leaving the fate of some of the main characters unanswered.  There was an aire of believability that slowly faded into the absurd in those last few chapters.
0470449748|4.0|This book contains hundreds of practice questions with detailed explanations of the answers.  Overall, this book is an excellent tool to prepare for the GMAT exam.  The only shortcoming, in my opinion, is that the arithmetic in the quantitative practice problems is generally less complicated than the arithmetic you will encounter in the actual exam.  The questions in the first section (the diagnostic section), which are actually old test questions, are more representative of the difficulty level of the actual exam questions.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|Awesome movie!!! Blue-ray movie was received in new condition as advertised, and works perfect. Won't be afraid to buy more movies off amazon.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Except for the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, this isn't so much propaganda/controversy as it is talking to regular Americans facing the challenges of the economic collapse, and getting insight from people on what is going on.     The questions it brings up are not new, or shocking to anyone, honestly. For the most part, it doesn't provoke as much thought/controversy as his typical movies. Most regular Americans feel that the bailout with our tax dollars was a scam, and how the companies to be helped were hand picked by the government/multinationals themselves. So regardless of your political leaning (unless you are a very well to do person whose friends or family haven't been faced with all the challenges of this collapse) you will find yourself nodding throughout the film - again, for the most part - . He poses what I believe is a good question for a Christian nation, when talking about Jesus and Capitalism.     Obviously Moore takes it a step further and brings out the demise of capitalism, comparing the collapse to the fall of other empires, and things of that nature. And in his typical fashion goes and puts on a show about doing citizens arrests on the corporations and what not (I don't find this particularly entertaining, nor am I sure why he does this at all)    Overall a nice film, that presents data in a way that is not boring and accessible to most people. He takes it a step too far, as usual - but less so than most of his other films.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I was sceptical, almost cringing, when i first heard about a sequel to Phantom of the Opera. I haven't been a huge fan of ALW's recent works and i thought this project might completely spoil his reputation.   But this is easily ALW's best music since Phantom, the score beautifully complements the original work without simply reprising earlier themes. The album is highlighted by several soaring and romantic melodies, sumptuously orchestrated and beautifully sung. In Love Never Dies, ALW successfully straddles the gap between Opera and Musical.
0307455874|1.0|If I hadn't read the book myself, I never would have believed the heights of arrogance that one person can reach.  Obama's book is the most self-aggrandizing piece of trash I've ever read.  Apparently no other politician or really no other person in all of history understands the nature of man and of government with such depth and clarity as Obama.  He also connects with the average person in a manner completely unfathomable by others who have sold out to special interests, corporate donors or have a severe case of Potomac fever that has left only Obama untouched and unblemished.  In the beginning, Obama did reveal his one weakness - he works too hard...he cares too much...and because he's unwilling to be corrupted by the corrupt system, he might not be able to change the beast of politics that claims every other elected official's integrity and character.  While a Democrat, Obama really sees himself as above politics and political parties - except for the fact that it is obvious that all Republicans are children of the devil and their ideas and policies have resulted in the continued death and destruction of this once great nation.  But standing alone above the fray is Barack Obama - unique in his perspective because of his unique background and rearing and thus, apparently, uniquely qualified to provide wisdom and clarity where others stumble in the darkness of their own limitations.  Like Isaac, the promised child, Obama finds himself on the altar willing to sacrifice himself for our nation, but through whom the promise of freedom lies.  The book was rubbish...page after page of unadulterated rubbish.
B001R10BM8|4.0|Great movie.  I didn't know the history and that this was an \\"unofficial\\" Bond movie.  The extras did a good job of explaining it and the movie is great.
0061914177|4.0|I met Gary through the Wine Library for business a few years ago.  To be honest, he is one of the only people I met in the industry that I really thought - wow - this guy is going to do what he says.  I remember looking around his office at all the NY Jets stuff and thinking, \\"You know this dude is going to own the team.\\"  The book for me is no different.  No one should read books hoping they have a magical plan for them.  The reality is they should open your mind and eyes, and put some fire under your feet.    He is honest about his business background, never claims to have had $5.00 and a dream.    If we all read this book and come away with a little understanding about the dynamics in force changing media and they way we communicate - great.  If we all get pumped up and our imagination ignited - even better.    I bet you the next book will be better - simply because we know Gary is listening and learning all the way.
0783231032|5.0|This is a great movie that takes a very funny look at how Americans could defend their coast.
0307588335|5.0|I was quite surprised by some of the highly negative reviews of this book. They made me wonder if we'd read the same book. I found the book to be very well-written, highly readable, informative and entertaining - if you have an interest in the subject matter. One negative review in particular was written by someone calling himself/herself \\"cynic,\\" which may tell you all you need to know about his/her review.    I don't mind that others didn't like the book as much as I did, but for me the \\"tone\\" of some of the negative reviews undermined what the reviewer was saying.
1906694176|4.0|After reading the previous two books in Stieg Larsson's trilogy, my expectations were huge. The previous two books combined great character development and excellent plot structure to rivet my attention. Salander, the quirky protagonist outdoes herself in this one. \\"Hornet's Nest\\" was full of the same interesting characters but tried to pack too much into the final book. It seemed an editor, after Larsson's untimely death, was trying to insert plot lines that led to more in the series. The book is twice as long as the previous two books; leaving out half would have improved it. Still, I'm a great Stieg Larsson fan. I love the local color of his place descriptions and the political intrigue of his plots. He always keeps me guessing until the last chapter.
0061124265|5.0|Veronica decides to die is probably the most ambitious masterwork of this renowned writer. Compelling and absorbing, deals with the indomitable will of a girl disposed to commit suicide. But the fate will show her a possibility with a boy who just only knows one way to establish with the outer world : through and thanks to the piano.<br /><br />These are basically the dramatic premise. From here to the end of the story you will be engaged with this intense story where the force of the redemption supported by the eventual intersections of the fate, can make the final destiny of these beings.<br /><br />Overwhelming, absorbing and intriguing from start to finish.<br /><br />Paolo Coelho's masterwork?

B002WCLG3O|2.0|I'm a pretty big Halo fan, having played all the games and read most the books. So when Legends was released I was pretty excited. But unfortuanteley it's not anything near the quality and calibur I've come to expect from the Halo brand. Some of the stories are well done, with good animation and sound. But many are just wierd, and don't fit into the rest of the Halo mythos at all. The opening story is a two part episode, I don't know why they cut it in half, but it's almost the same as the history story on Animatrix. It's rather well done, and in my opinion the best part of the disc, documenting the history of the Halo universe and giving us our first views of the Forerunners.<br /><br />The rest of the films are rather, meh. Some have poor cinematics and even wierder stories. The japanese influence on the series went way overboard. One feature was the story of an elite rebel, with the Elite culture depicted as a samurai one. Another film featured an emo anime soldier on a mission to destroy a prototype mech robot to keep it from falling into Covenant hands.<br /><br />The only other mini film I liked was the last one, a fast paced CG animation work that features Master Chief and several other Spartans on a rescue mission. Again, it's plagued by inconsistancies with the books, and leaves you wondering when there was ever a fat simoan spartan. But over all it's pretty good. It really shows off the elite combat skills the spartans are well known for.<br /><br />In the end, I'd say you should just rent or borrow this movie.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|This is what Seth Godin seems to have building to in his work for years. It builds on his other work, but goes far beyond it. As he states in the book (paraphrasing), it's not a business book, it's a personal challenge for your life.     Seth does something few can pull off: this book is a personal challenge a minute, but never misses a beat in being inspirational, encouraging and catalyzing. There is no preaching or backside kicking, but neither is it a soother, a feel-good-and-it-will-all-be-ok cheerleading session.     Linchpin says you are afraid to own your genius, or you're afraid to produce from it and put it out there in the world. And it puts that fear in such a believable, workable context that you can't help but feel yourself growing larger than it is as you read. And the feeling, I find, lasts past the reading and into the work, another rare and valuable quality in a book.    Linchpin also says that in our business / economic environment, there is a large and important role for a new type of contributor, the, yes, linchpin. I don't think he is saying that everyone must be a linchpin. He's certainly not saying that every job can be a linchpin job or that every company will welcome and reward a linchpin. I think he is saying that if you recognize your own genius, your ability to make a difference others haven't yet made, solve a problem others haven't yet solved, get something intractable unstuck, then you're an artist within your context. He challenges you, and even gracefully begs you, to step past that fear that every artist of every stripe gets stuck behind, to leave behind perfection, and to \\"ship\\". Once you have that habit, and then that reputation, then you are a linchpin, and thus uniquely indispensable.     The story behind the premise and the challenge is woven so well that this never feels like a business book or a self-help book, but one that crosses genres and demands to be finished once it has begun. I enjoyed it immensely.    I've listened to this a few times on audio (Don't Miss Seth reading this book, it's worth every penny), and I have it in paper and am about to add it to my Kindle. With every reading I find layer after layer of new, good stuff. And every time I feel a new jolt of challenge, courage and determination. It's going on a short shelf of really, really favorite books, alongside -- I was thrilled to hear this is also a favorite of Seth's -- the Zanders' [[ASIN:3925056033 The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life]]. From this short shelf I read and refer time and time again, and buy copy after copy to give away to friends and clients.     I can't wait to see what Seth Godin does next, but at the same time, I'm not in a big hurry for his next book. This one is so rich I'll be working from it for a good while still.
B0035FQ1UU|3.0|I'll make this review short.<br /><br />The filmed an end of the world disaster. We've seen them all before... only this time it's the politicians playing God and withholding information from the people. The funny part is that they wait till the last minute to tell people what is happening...but by the time they tell them this the State of California has already sunk into the ocean and a massive Volcanic erruption occurs at yellow stone... Yes... I'm sure everyone hasn't figured out to \\"RUN THE HELL FOR THEIR LIVES!\\" and they really are depending on the Government at that point to lead them. Yeah.... right. The entire movie seems to revolve around this plot of being moral and doing what is right. Yet... the people that get saved are all the immoral politcal leaders and super wealthy that couldn't care less about the people they step on.<br /><br />  What point does it make being a politcal leader and fleeing your country leaving your people to die while you escape safely. Yes... that's exactly the type of trash that make it to safety in this movie.. and all for the sake of humanity. Sure... if that's what humanity is down to than we are already doomed. The more interesting part about the movie is that it's ideal that a plot like this could happen. The lower classes of society always get the short end of the stick. In the end it always comes down to status... but strangely enough what good is money when the economy has been destroyed by mother nature herself?<br /><br /> The Kings didn't build the Pyramids.. the slaves built them. It's the working class that drives society... not politicians that judge the world from affar. It's just funny watching this movie thinking what sort of world will be created by these people.<br /><br />On top of that the movie itself is a lot of long winded speeches and even one when there's only but a few minutes left till doomsday and the politicians are still playing God decided the fates of people. When will they learn that without the people they have no power or authority? I suppose that's the part of the film that made this \\"fiction\\". How everyone kept order and all of sudden no longer worried about their own families because they were so set on saving politicians and Giraffs (ok well the animals were worth it). Very unrealistic... who would continue to work for these slimes knowing that they wouldn't get another paycheck?<br /><br />On top of that you can put the annoying main family that added nothing to the film. They were the classic family in distress. Annoying kids yelling mommy... save daddy where's daddy yatta yatta. SHEESH! enough already! I kept routing that they would fall in an earthquake crack. Every moment with them off film was a blessing.<br /><br />Overall 3/5<br /><br />This is a long film 2 hours Plus with a lot more dialogue than needed for this type of film.authority?

1402211252|5.0|See the plot synopsis on the back flap of the book image.      An heiress must marry one of her cousins in order to inherit.  And we're off on one of the most delightful regency romps ever penned.      Freddy is one of my favorite Heyer heroes.  He is nothing like the standard regency hero that the heroine thinks she wants (dashing, alpha, corinthian, rake, etc.)  But he is so funny, so capable, so kind, so reliable, and saves the day in the end.  You will find yourself rooting for him and Kitty from the moment they arrive in London.    The secondary characters and sub-plots are hilarious, especially poor Dolph.
B00004WGAK|3.0|Like many of the comments on this great movie, the problem with this copy from Madacy Video and billed as a 'Excelsior Collectors Edition' is a crappy copy to DVD. It is amazing that while the only Academy Award Nomination this film got was for Cinematography yet no one has as yet made a good DVD.    The film is interesting from several points of view. Some have compared it to the great westerns such as [[ASIN:B0012Q4CH8 John Wayne - Stagecoach Tin Sign 12.5W x 16\\"H]], [[ASIN:0792163710 Shane]], and [[ASIN:B000JLPMPS Unforgiven [Blu-ray]]]. I'm not sure it is in that category, but it's a very good western.     Originally Rod Serling wrote a screen play, but he was replaced by Sam Peckinpah and Stanley Kubrick was hired to direct. Brando didn't like ever one of them; fired both and took over writing and directing himself. He delivered a ponderous 5 hour film to the studio and walked away. Probably Archie Marshek who edited this into the theatrical release of just over two hours should be given more credit. The other 3 hours of film were, it seems, destroyed at some point.    I can't recommend this version if you happen to see it, although it seems to me it contains at least a few minutes of film I haven't seen on other versions. Maybe some day someone will make a Blu Ray copy of the original. I know a good version exists because I saw it on TV just a few years ago and it was gorgeous.
0385341008|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is written in letters and I was a little put off by that in the beginning but I very quickly became sucked in. This was indeed a heart warming tale and the characters are all very endearing. It is the sort of book that lifts your spirits.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|The first thing I thought after hearing the opening track, Raised on Rock, was hell yeah! I like Scorpions, but I've never been a huge fan. I did see them live in concert back in 2002 with Deep Purple and Dio. They rocked on stage, so I continued to buy the albums released since then. Unbreakable and Humantity Hour 1 had some good tracks, but the song to song quality didn't hold up on repeat listens. At least to me, because I know many people love both of those.<br /><br />As I listened to Sting in the Tail for the first time yesterday from start to finish, I realized there wasn't one song I didn't like. The first single, Raised on Rock is my favorite, with it's great guitar melodies, catchy lyrics and chorus. I also really like The Good Die Young, even though you can barely hear Tarja Turunen (former singer of Nightwish) singing backing vocals during the chorus. At least give her a verse to sing. Sly is the weakest of the bunch, but it's still not a bad ballad. In fact I liked the diversity here. You get 7 fast paced rockers, 1 mid-tempo rocker and 3 ballads. The muscianship is excellent and Klaus Meine's vocals are still strong and unique. Too bad this is the end of the road for a band that's been around for nearly 40 years. It stinks that all the great rock bands of old will slowly be fading away now with age. At least the Scorpions decided to go out with a bang.<br /><br />I already have my Iron Maiden tickets for this summer, and I can't wait for the new album, The Final Frontier, from those guys, but I would probably fork over the money to see Scorpions one last time if they come around my area. With the great new material here thrown into the mix with the classic tunes, this going to be one heck of a final tour.
0307454541|5.0|Excellent read. This book had been recommended to me by many friends and it lived up to my high expectations, I was not disapointed
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Nope, despite the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I won't buy this ridiculously brazen effort to force fans to double-dip.  A useless second disc that contains an ordinary DVD version (why do I need that with the blu-ray disc?) AND NOT A SINGLE SPECIAL FEATURE.  Show greedy Fox that we aren't the mindless consumers they think we are and save your money for the later edition that DOES have special features.

0385341008|4.0|Coping is a skill that was customarily taught, back in the day. Endurance, resilience, humour - the foundation of toughness during difficult times. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society illustrates those three qualities and is fun to read, as well.

0307271862|3.0|Like many other readers, I've become a fan of scandinavian mysteries recently. With The Man from Beijing, we have another example of the genre.  I'd rate this novel somewhere in the second tier - not on the same plane as Mankell's Kurt Wallender's series or Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  The book starts well, but somewhere in the middle, the plot starts to bog down.  It's a dark story, but that's a feature of this subgenre - but things started to lose steam when the plot shifted to the second main POV character.  I found Birgitta Roslin an appealing protagonist, but Hong Qui less so.  Another strong point for me, was the Chinese aspect, which seemed to be well researched.  In the end though, the book lacked the tightness I've come to expect from Mankell.  If you haven't read any of his Kurt Wallender books, start there first.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Just to add some counter arguments in defence of this version: in an interview Cameron said there wasn't much \\"finished\\" material missing from the final cut, just a couple of scenes at the start showing the 'uncaring Earth'. Remember because of the cost of CGI the \\"20 to 40 minutes\\" of extra scenes will likely be very rough, may be only with blue-screen backgrounds and won't in anyway add to the experience. Also many other 'extras' can still be found on the website. The fact that they are getting this out so quickly is a virtue and the cost (£10 in UK for the ordinary DVD) is relatively cheap for a new blockbuster release.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|Brilliant, beautiful music.  To those who rated this music poorly, I don't know what you were expecting.  Soldier of Love is wonderfully written and produced, it's original, uniquely Sade yet timeless and classic.  Her signature beats, her signature voice, her signature lyrics, but somehow she has evolved since her previous recordings.  I would not rate every song a perfect 5 but it is consistently great and exactly what I was hoping for.
B001EYGOEM|1.0|What has happened to real country music?  Where did it go?  This is nothing but rock stuff and bubblegum pop aimed toward the young people.  But don't call it country music.  It is so sad what has happened to a genre that used to have heart and soul.<br /><br />Listen to these songs by a girl who has obviously been \\"fixed\\" by today's technology at the recording studio.  Taylor Swift is marketed toward the young audience.  And that is fine....just don't call it country music.  Its an insult to Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and especially Kitty Wells...the undisputed all time queen of country, real country that is.<br /><br />Country music used to have heart.  It used to have soul.  It used to touch one and make one cry.  As the great George Jones put it, \\"Its all nothing but rock crap now.\\"  Country music has lost its integrity for the sake of making a buck.<br /><br />I listened to this CD with an open mind and it just breaks my heart to see what they call country music these days.  What happened??  And why can't we get it back??

B00275EGX8|5.0|The Hurt Locker...where to even start, this film blew me away. literally. I was skeptical upon watching the film based on rumors that I heard involving that the film was political. Having some of my family members in Iraq and Afghanistan, I am sensitive to anti-war movies that portray the troops in a bad light. This film was NOT political which was a relief, in fact the film did a damn good job at portraying real life EOD work.     I really enjoyed this film I couldn't remember a time where I was so immersed in the story and felt that the characters were real and I was right there with them on their tour defusing bombs. The suspense was great I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire film. I think most Americans should view this film, obviously it is not showing the whole picture of the Iraq war but shows a good example of what our boys go through and are faced with on a day to day basis.    The actors did a top notch job and this film deserves every oscar it won. The Blu Ray has an outstanding picture and looks great throughout. I have yet to view the special features of the disc but do plan on watching the behind the scenes portion. The sound is good especially on a home theatre system. Check this film out for it was the best film I saw in 2009.
0061673730|4.0|I rarely reread books, especially those that didn't fascinate me initially.  As a 20-year old, three decades ago, this book unmoved me.  A philosophical inquiry disguised as a road trip?  Life seemed too short to ask so many questions.    Ah, but time and the maturity it hopefully creates have a way of changing one's focus.  As a parent and one who's faced much more life, I found a rereading of this book to be illuminating.    Pirsig cleverly intertwines the parallel stories of his attempts to come to terms with his troubled son; the encounters with his troubled former self termed Phaedrus; and finally his life-long inquiries into integrating the rational and artistic aspects of our souls and the search for the overarching Quality which gives meaning to our lives.    Is he successful?  In terms of showing that a better life is one that is examined, and that the questions asked are more useful than any answer - yes.  Impatient readers and those demanding certain answers will be disappointed.    This is not a perfect book - it appears to be written from notes taken during the road trip, as opposed to firmly polished final work.  The narrator has a certainty that can be grating. And the cult-like popularity is hard to fathom.  Perhaps its timing and mis-labeling as a 'New-Age' book helped.    Still, it has made me spend time examining not only my values, now and past, but my relationship with my son.  With respect to the latter, Pirsig's son's tragic death following the close of the book only underscores the need to best live your life while you can.
B0013TPVXS|4.0|With every action, there is a consequence -- and Well of Ascension, the follow-up to Brandon Sanderson's excellent Mistborn: The Final Empire is all about unexpected consequences and their impact on the residents of the Final Empire.<br /><br />Following the events of the first novel, things haven't quite worked out quite how Vin, Elend and Kelsier's crew had in mind.  Luthadel is under siege and strange things are happening in the mists. A mysterious Mistborn is stalking the streets of the city at night and many questions remain about the Lord Ruler, the Deepness and allomancy.<br /><br />In the first half of the book, Sanderson begins his set-up and there are some interesting twists and turns, but it does tend to drag a bit. Vin deals with some internal struggles, which while logical, do feel a bit like the infamous \\"ball\\" sequences in the first novel.<br /><br />Yet somewhere after the midway point Sanderson finishes assembling his plot and things begin to unfold in a surprising and exciting manner. Although the climax of Mistborn: the Final Empire is superior, the closing events of Well of Ascension are impressively rendered, offering Sanderson's strong blend of compelling characters and huge action sequences. The ending expertly sets up book three, following the overall theme of \\"unintended\\" consequences that runs through the course of the novel.<br /><br />Despite the slow start, Well of Ascension is a worthy follow-up to its predecessor and is more proof that Brandon Sanderson is the best fantasy novelist of his generation, the true heir to Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin
B002VPE1B6|5.0|By far, this is the greatest film I've ever seen. The action scenes, the love scenes, the score, the plot... you'll be captivated from the first ten minutes, as I was/am. James Cameron is an epic genius, and you'll be missing out if you do not see this movie. A must own for generations to come!
B002ZFQD04|5.0|First time I have ever had the priviledge to see Madonna live and it was amazing. It's pretty easy to see why she's the Queen of Pop.  To quote her from the show \\"You can't touch this mother f*&#er!\\"
B002QEXN2K|3.0|Lately it seems as though John Mayer has been bent on committing social/career suicide with certain awesome (me being sarcastic) comments he's made in various interviews. If you haven't heard anything about it, they're the kind of comments he's had to issue public apologies for ([...]). I was having a conversation with a close friend recently and he said something along the lines of, \\"I really want to like John Mayer but lately he's been making it really hard.\\"<br /><br />This isn't anything we haven't seen any number of other times with various celebrities. But as far as John Mayer goes I feel that it's a particular shame because the dude is really intelligent and seems like a cool guy. It seems as though he's realized he may need to stop with the stupid comments, let's just hope that from here on out he sticks to what he does best--playing the crap out of the guitar.<br /><br />Enough about that.<br /><br />Around the time John Mayer released his album \\"Room For Squares\\" and was really beginning to gain popularity I really didn't care for his music too much. But when he began his John Mayer Trio venture in 2005 with Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Palladino on bass, my interest was piqued. Until then, I'd written Mayer off because I really didn't care for songs like \\"No Such Thing\\", or \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" but when I heard the Trio's first single \\"Who Did You Think I Was\\" I thought to myself, \\"This guy can really play.\\"<br /><br />From my exposure to the John Mayer Trio and enjoyment of their subsequent live album \\"Try!\\" I decided that I'd go back and give Mayer's studio work a chance and since then I've really come to appreciate it for what it is--mostly good (sometimes great) music that comes from a very creative individual. If you like poppy or bluesy guitar work, then Mayer is the man for you. I might even go so far as to say he's our modern day Stevie Ray Vaughn. Well, he could be if he'd allow himself to be.<br /><br />Mayer's latest studio effort \\"Battle Studies\\" is a good album. But for him, it's a safe album at best. There really aren't many risks taken. It's his fourth full-length album and it explores the territory of relationships, mostly as it pertains to their downfall. The frustrating thing for me is that this album and his last, 2006s \\"Continuum\\", have all the elements to be official John Mayer Trio albums in that both Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino are present on almost all of the tracks and are even pictured in the booklet for \\"Continuum\\". In addition, Jordan also shares production credit with Mayer for both albums. But these albums just don't have the same feel that the official Trio releases did. Yes, they are good albums but my personal desire is that he would focus more on the Trio, cause it's there that he allows himself to be a bit more daring.<br /><br />All with see with \\"Battle Studies\\" is more of the hopeless romantic and contemplative John Mayer. The album's opener \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" its best track by far. It just has an overall unique sound with lots of cool guitar overdubs and experimentations. The straight up drumbeat and cool bass part only contribute to its coolness. That song alone would garner at least a four star review but the rest of the album, while okay, seems to just pull it down.<br /><br />Other high points are the smooth-jazz feeling \\"Assassin\\" and the funky drumbeat and fuzzy guitar sound on the song \\"Crossroads\\". Other than that, the rest of the songs just kind of blur together.<br /><br />Taylor Swift is present for a vocal duet with John on the song \\"Half of My Heart\\", but even then it almost qualifies as a \\"Why bother?\\" moment as her voice is only singularly discernable for literally two lines of lyrics in the entire song.<br /><br />\\"Battle Studies\\" as a whole is a creatively solid album but does not at all represent or explore the territory that John Mayer is truly capable of.<br /><br />As far as the live experience goes, as if to add to my suffering, Steve Jordanhimself was present with Mayer as his touring drummer--which in the past hasn't been the case. I found myself genuinely wishing that Pino Palladino had been present too because if that were they case maybe we could have been treated to a small Trio set somewhere in the middle like John did with his most recent live release \\"Where the Light Is\\". With that experience he started the show off with a solo acoustic set, then moved on to a Trio set in the middle, and finally finished things off with a full band performance of his most famous solo songs.<br /><br />As far as the show I saw, no such luck. But seeing Steve Jordan was a real treat as he is one of my favorite drummers. And even though there was no presence of official Trio material, the evening didn't disappoint overall. Mayer's guitar playing is entertaining enough in and of itself but the various facial expressions he makes only make him more fun to watch.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about the live concert experience is when the artist or band personalizes the experience by adding in impromptu jam sessions between or at the end of songs. This concert in particular was chock full of them. One such jam session was the highlight of the evening for me in that it started off with a drum solo by Jordan and gradually led into a jam session with the full band. To me, those are the kinds of things that make the price of admission close to being worth it.<br /><br />One thing in particular that keeps this concert experience at a four star level instead of the full five is the lack of rocking guitar solos. There were plenty of soulful blues solos which were great, but I just kept finding myself wishing I could witness something along the lines of his guitar solo from the song \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\"--the Jimi Hendrix cover from the Trio's \\"Try!\\" album.<br /><br />Overall the concert was enjoyable and there were definitely head-bobbing moments but I kind of felt awkward as I didn't fit the bill for what the majority of the crowd seemed to be--either middle school girls or middle-aged women (let's be honest, Cougars). But if John's music has proven to appeal to people of all ages and sexes alike then more power to him.<br /><br />When all is said and done, if I had a personal message/question for John it would probably be, \\"Why can't you capture the energy you consistently display at your live shows and put that on a studio album?\\"h in the past hasn't been the case. I found myself genuinely wishing that Pino Palladino had been present too because if that were they case maybe we could have been treated to a small Trio set somewhere in the middle like John did with his most recent live release \\"Where the Light Is\\".

B002GZQYMK|4.0|In my high school days--when I was into bands like Creed and Good Charlotte--I would automatically write off bands like Muse because they reminded me too much of Radiohead, who I hated.<br /><br />Nowadays, thank goodness, my ways and tastes have changed.<br /><br />Muse is a perfect example of a modern rock band that consistently cranks out solid albums and even more solid live shows. I've had the privilege of seeing them live twice now and both times rank right up there some of the best concerts I've ever seen--and, all bragging truly aside, I've been to many a concert in my day.<br /><br />This most recent tour is in support of their latest album, 2009's \\"The Resistance\\" (more on that later).<br /><br />While this album doesn't represent the band's pinnacle (2003's \\"Absolution\\" holds that spot for me), it is a uniquely engaging and entertaining album and it definitely made my list of the best of 2009.<br /><br />\\"The Resistance\\" is Muse's fifth studio album and while all of their previous albums were self-produced along with help from other production collaborators, this album is their first with sole control. And rightly so, for such an epic and ambitious undertaking as this album has proven to be, it could only have come from the minds and interpretations of the band members themselves (mostly lead singer/guitarist/primary songwriter Matthew Bellamy).<br /><br />I love to see bands evolve over time. Even if they evolve in what the majority of people agree to be the \\"wrong direction\\", at least it shows that they're willing to try something different. Even though I don't consider \\"The Resistance\\" to be Muse's best album I have to give them credit for still exhibiting elements of that stadium rock sound we all know and love (see the Queen-esque \\"United States of Eurasia\\") but at the same time exhibiting a new and exciting evolution.<br /><br />As far as this idea of evolution goes, it really shows through in that this album explores the electronic and classical genres a great deal more than any of Muse's previous releases.<br /><br />A perfect example of the electronic side of things would be the song \\"Undisclosed Desires\\". Even though it's mostly electronic in terms of drum beats and bass lines, it also has symphonic elements sort of soaring over the top of everything else that's going on in the song.<br /><br />In terms of classical elements, the best example of this would be the albums three part closer, \\"The Exogenesis Symphony\\". I'm a huge sucker for things like this. I love multi-part songs/titles that are epic, tell a great story, and last for minutes on end (this creation clocks in at 12:51 total). It is presented in three movements, \\"Overture\\", \\"Cross Pollination\\", and \\"Redemption\\". All of the string arrangements and compositions were done by Bellamy himself and the work explores the theme of the end of humanity (\\"Overture\\"), our attempts at survival (\\"Cross Pollination\\"), and our realization that unless we drastically change something about the way we live, everything that has happened will only happen over and over again (\\"Redemption\\").<br /><br />Each of the three members of this band (the aforementioned Bellamy, bassist Christopher Wolstenholme, and drummer Dominic Howard) have always brought the heat in terms of stylistically identifiable parts on their various instruments (most notably Wolstenholme's bass part for the song \\"Hysteria\\" from the \\"Absolution\\" release) and all of those elements are definitely present on this album. That fact, coupled with the fact that this studio effort really explores new territory makes \\"The Resistance\\" a truly enjoyable experience that, if nothing else, begs to have some sort of science fiction movie made that is based solely on its music--or at the very least, \\"The Exogenesis Symphony\\".<br /><br />One of my determining factors for how good I think an album is would be how well the songs seem like they would translate in a live setting. In this situation I was lucky enough to have been able to see firsthand whether or not this was the case. To put it quite simply, and I know this sounds clich&eacute;; words really can't describe it. Basically, if you ever get the chance to see Muse live, do yourself a favor and spend the money. It's a guaranteed non-disappointment.<br /><br />Even though the songs compiling this album only earn it a four star review, the way they translate live coupled with older classics easily bump the concert experience to a full five stars. A conspiracy theorist might even think that it's all a ploy to get people to the live shows since that's where the real money seems to lie in the music industry these days...<br /><br />The tour in support of \\"The Resistance\\" was Muse's biggest yet. The stage setup alone cost over $2 million (check out a picture here [...]. The stage was centered around three mock skyscrapers which at the beginning of the show dropped down to reveal each of the three band members on his own riser probably around fifteen feet in the air. Of course, there was a rotating drum kit--something with which (as a drummer myself) you can never go wrong. Their laser show was superb and at one point giant confetti-filled balloons that looked like eyeballs were unleashed on the crowd. Some concerts are emotional, some are even disturbing, but Muse puts on a show that is intense and just plain fun.<br /><br />The experience, like any, is one that can easily turn magical, especially if you have a loved one who has a mutual appreciation who can share it with you. I was blessed enough to have this so it made the night that much more enjoyable. One of the most beautiful things about music in general is that every time you buy an album, if it turns out to be one that you really enjoy there's an excitement and anticipation that, \\"Maybe someday I'll get the chance to hear these songs in person.\\"<br /><br />My hope for music lovers is that no matter which artists or bands you love that you'll get a chance to see them in person at some point because it has the potential to cement them into the hall of fame of the things you truly loved most about this life.ite simply, and I know this sounds cliché; words really can't describe it.

B00004XONN|5.0|Tonight was a good night. One of my favorite things to do in life is peruse record stores to see if I can find any gems to add to my cd collection. Tonight after I met a friend for beers I trekked down to Everyday Music--a huge record store on West Burnside here in downtown Portland that I frequent. I went there with the intent of securing for myself a copy of Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\", which after all these years is still an album I've found myself without a physical copy of. Sure enough, I found one used for six bucks. Sweet.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that I'm what you would call a Radiohead expert. In fact, several years ago I really cared nothing for this band. I'd even go so far as to say I actually hated them. Oddly enough, given the subject of this review, \\"Kid A\\" was the album I hated most and hated them for.<br /><br />I think my hatred stemmed from a live performance I saw them do on what I think was Saturday Night Live. They were performing the song \\"Idioteque\\" and lead singer Thom Yorke was bobbing and spazzing around like a mad man while he sang lyrics that made absolutely no sense like, \\"Go on, take the money and run,\\" over and over. To me, it was all just too weird a combination and I really couldn't understand how anyone could like a band like this.<br /><br />This was all around the time I was in high school. I've mentioned before that during this time I was really into bands like Creed, Good Charlotte, and Limp Bizkit, to name a few. If this isn't a good enough indicator of why I may not have enjoyed a band like Radiohead, it should be.<br /><br />For example, how many Nickelback fans do you know who really just get into the music of TV On the Radio? I'm not saying I am or ever have been a fan of Nickelback (I hope I'd have the sense to have someone shoot me if I was). I'm just helping you to make the connection of why I may not have enjoyed Radiohead given that bands like Creed were usually in my cd player.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />Times have changed, I've grown up, and let's just say this: Creed came out with a new album and did a comeback tour last year and I didn't exactly run out and buy a copy of the album and a ticket to the show. There will always be a special place in my heart for that band, but that place in my heart also has a special compartment for hate and resentment geared towards all the people who still to this day make fun of me for ever liking them.<br /><br />Okay, moving on.<br /><br />Radiohead's fourth studio album, \\"Kid A\\" was quite the departure for them in terms of sound. Their first two albums have been described as \\"anthemic\\" and were way more accessible and easy-to-swallow. However, I wouldn't say \\"Kid A\\" comes as a total shock as their previous work \\"OK Computer\\" sort of kept that accessibility while at the same time hinted at what they explored more deeply with this album. I look at \\"OK Computer\\" as being a sort of bridge between the old Radiohead and the Radiohead that has mostly held true up through today.<br /><br />One of the things that most surprises me is that it seems people were ready and willing to accept this change. This is evidenced in the fact that \\"Kid A\\" was the first Radiohead album ever to debut at No. 1 in the United States. It then went on to be nominated for \\"Album of the Year\\" at that year's Grammy awards and actually took home the \\"Best Alternative Album\\" award.<br /><br />\\"Kid A\\" marks the second time Radiohead paired with Nigel Godrich--the producer with which they've worked on every album since. I've always admired bands who can work with the same producer year after year on every album yet still mightily evolve their sound. A lot of bands aren't capable of that and have to constantly seek after new producers to challenge them and keep them fresh. The absolute best example of monstrous evolution with a constant producer would be The Beatles with George Martin. The man literally produced every studio album the band ever made (excluding \\"Let It Be\\").<br/><br />If actual drums and guitars--both acoustic and electric--were heavily present on all of Radiohead's previous albums then they're only about half-present on \\"Kid A\\". If there were a shock to the system when realizing this album for the first time, this would probably be it--it could probably easily be classified as an electronic album.<br /><br />It is one of those albums that just begs to only ever be listened to all the way through. Yes, each and every song is great but the album is a unique enough experience to where it's a necessity that it is kept as a whole. Perhaps that's why the band chose not to release any official singles from the album.<br /><br />If I had to pick a few standout tracks they would be:<br /><br />-\\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" for its eerie electric piano.<br /><br />-\\"The National Anthem\\" for its repetitive, yet killer bass line, rocking drums, and most importantly the horn section jabs that are scattered throughout.<br /><br />-\\"How To Disappear Completely\\" for its soothing acoustic guitar and effects. I picture myself being able to fall asleep to this song. Who knows what kind of screwed up dreams it would bring.<br /><br />-And finally-<br /><br />-\\"Idioteque\\" for just being plain weird and entertaining. It has one of the most unique-sounding beats I've ever heard. Just don't ever ask me what the lyrics mean cause I'm truly stumped on that one.<br /><br />When listening to albums I always ask myself, \\"Is this good enough to stand the test of time?\\" Very rarely do I come across an album where the answer is completely and unequivocally a resounding \\"Yes!\\"<br /><br />With \\"Kid A\\" that's the case.<br /><br />Some of the accolades \\"Kid A\\" has garnered:<br /><br />-The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever - NME (2006)<br />-The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time - Rolling Stone (2004)<br />-The 100 Best Albums of the Decade - Rolling Stone (2009)<br />-Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years - Spin (2005)<br />-The All-Time 100 Albums - Time (2006)present on all of Radiohead's previous albums then they're only about half-present on \\"Kid A\\".

B002UXRGM0|5.0|I just bought the blu-ray from Amazon.uk, couldn't wait for the US release (and when you live in Brazil the freight cost pretty much the same from there), and there is nothing else to add about the documentary, it just has all the BBC quality already demonstrated on others like Planet Earth, but I was amazed with the image quality, they really improved that on Life, some images are even more clear than in Baraka (which is a high standard when it comes to image quality). Just a note for those buying it from Amazon.uk: the blu-ray is recorded on 50hz (PAL) and that won't run on a US PS3 or some BD players that don't support 50Hz (instead of the standard US 60Hz NTSC). Bottom line, great show, highly recommend it!
1402720602|3.0|First of all, I am an American carpenter who enjoys making furniture, neat stairways, that kind of stuff. My problem with this book so far is that he gives dimensions in inches, AND metric. I don't use metric in my daily labors, and don't feel like starting now. That's really my only gripe with this book. If he would decide on which measurement system to use, and stick with that throughout. I most definately would NOT have bought it if I had known this. I don't like jumping around.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|Found this film kept you on the edge of your seat. Overall Blu-ray quality was great! For those that said they couldn't see what was going on half the time - well I've got a LG 55LH90 setup beautifully, and do you know what, I could see everything! Can't believe that so much time and, I assume money, was used to make this movie. Another thing about this movie was that it was different with several plot twists at the end. So for less than the cost of going to see the movie, and you're a syfy fan - get it while it's on at a great price!
B002RT85RW|5.0|I see that the price of these have gone up substantially over the past few days.<br />I took a gamble and purchased these printable BD-Rs for $135.00 through Nikoneko Ya on Amazon and paid $31.44 shipping from Japan. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! They arrived at my house two days before the rest of my order from Amazon did. The bottom line is that at $3.33 each including shipping these are less than half the price of other major brand printable BD-Rs.<br />I've tested them in three stand alone Blu-ray players and they function flawlessly in all of them.<br />Don't let the shipping from Japan scare you.<br />Outstanding. Highly recommended!
B002S0OBMS|1.0|I was disappointed.  I expected music as appealing as that in Phantom of the Opera CD's, but this was hard to listen to.  Service from Amazon was super, though.
B0035J6TAI|2.0|After all this time of not hearing much from PG, I was looking forward to this one. After listening to this material and really wanting to like it I've just got to say this is got to be one of the most trying and passionless set of covers songs to be recorded by anyone. I will give credit for picking a very eclectic and varied set of songs, yet I find that the arrangements all sounded the same. Oh well I guess maybe I'll come around, to liking this CD, like maybe the next time I feel really depressed and suicidal.
B000000OSW|5.0|Peter Gabriel has had an interesting career moving from prog-rock radical, to pop superstar, to world-beat saviour.     Released in 1992, at a time when grunge was at its peak, \\"Us\\" includes the singles \\"Digging in the Dirt\\", \\"Steam\\", and \\"Blood of Eden\\" as well as many more well written songs. No filler here.    Again Gabriel works closely with longtime producer Daniel Lanois who has worked with Bob Dylan, U2, and Sinead O'Conner just to mention a few.  They continue to incorporate World Music or Non-Western musicians, instruments, textures, and rhythms into the music to get the sounds  that they want, and in the process expose the listener to some interesting music.   The end of Gabriel's marriage undoubtedly contributed to the self-consciousness and introspection that permeate the lyrics on this recording.    I've been a Peter Gabriel fan since the early Genesis days and \\"Us\\" is one of my favorite Peter Gabriel recordings.    I highly recommend \\"Us\\" even if you are not a Peter Gabriel fan. You just need to be able to appreciate quality music.

The film was painfully slow for me...after 1 hr, I went to bed. The 2nd 1/2 picks up and gets better.  But as far as Bluray over dvd....no need to pay more for less visually..and the extras are a real snooze fest as well.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|It's terrific.  Wonderful to listen to.  I've taught Biology and have a Masters degree in Zoology, and I think Oprah does great.  Science doesn't have to have a British accent.  (Attenborough doesn't actually have any science degrees anyway, he's a broadcaster as well.)    Some nature programs are boring, not this one.
1439138311|4.0|This is not a page turner in the classic sense, but it kept me reading nevertheless.  Ellis, a young Irish girl, is unexpectedly sent to live in Brooklyn through the intervention of a priest friend of the family and her charismatic sister Rose. Her life in America is very different from what she's used to and eventually she becomes involved with an Italian young man with a fun family that is very different from her own.  It is a lovely read, filled with  simple passages such as the one describing Ellis eating Italian food when she first meets her boyfriend's family...we're so used to every culture being readily available today that its hard to imagine the confusion she feels at being fed spaghetti!  The entire story is filled with these passages, quiet, lovely and thoughtful in unexpected ways. I was pleased by the ending, I kept reading expecting the book to become predictable and trite, but it never did.  I will seek out other work by Toibin.
B003F3NEBG|2.0|This product mystifies me.    This BBC version of Pride and Prejudice has already been released on [[ASIN:B001E2JNA6 Blu-ray]] in a widescreen format. There is nothing in the product description here telling me why this is being re-released, but the technical specs say this is a 4:3 fullscreen version. Is it cropped? Pan and Scan? Do they even make High Definition TVs that are 4:3? Or does the widescreen version actually crop some of the original footage (i.e. was this originally filmed in 4:3 so that the 4:3 is the \\"real\\" version)? (That last scenario seems highly unlikely, since at least according to imdb Pan and Scan versions of this film have been made in the past - that would seem unnecessary if the original film was 4:3.) Or are the technical specs some terrible mistake and there is something else unique about this re-release?    [Edit: My original review also puzzled over the tech specs listing this as a single disk edition. The specs have since been updated to indicate that this product comes on 2 disks.]
B000AQBAUI|5.0|I mean that as a compliment (though I honestly don't know if calling someone a hound dog *is* a compliment or not!)    Leaf Hound is just one among *many* hard rock bands from the early 70's that never got much credit.  These guys aren't necessarily doing anything groundbreaking here- Growers of Mushroom is definitely just another hard rock album.      I still love the album of course, but it's not much different from say, Steppenwolf or Captain Beyond.  Perhaps a little heavier than those two artists, but that's about it.    Actually \\"Stagnant Pool\\" reminds me of Procol Harum's \\"Whiskey Train\\" because of the guitar riff.  It's a great song though.  I think this song came out before the Procol Harum song, so I have to give Leaf Hound a ton of credit there.      I hope I'm not getting off on the wrong note here and leading everyone to believe I actually sort of dislike this album or something- not at ALL.  Growers of Mushroom is *still* a terrific album from beginning to end.  I *still* highly recommend it, though I'm only able to recommend this album to people who love early 70's hard rock.      I guess \\"Work my Body\\" would be my pick for favorite song, though it's hard to pick between this and a couple others.  Still, you can't go wrong with Leaf Hound.  Quality music is quality music, and it's really easy to fall in love with an album like this if you're someone who admires and follows the hard rock genre.
0743201140|1.0|I purchased this book used on Amazon and started reading it with great anticipation. I covered the first 80 pages in about an hour and went online to enter my code to take the online test. However if you buy the book used then the code won't work. AND the publisher won't sell additional codes online so the only way to take the online test is to buy the book new. Great, now I have a $4 paperweight or doorstop and it will be 5 days before my new copy arrives and I can pick up where I left off. So far the book seems really interesting, however don't waste cash on a used version. Somewhat of a cheap trick on the publisher's part.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|Personally knowing this band makes this CD even more special..It has some cool hard hitting sounds, couple of ballads and some ROCKIN lyrics!...I do however wish Matthias would have LONGER solos!..This is by far one of the SCORPIONS better works..I am sad to see them retire in a couple of years...Its been a pleasure from this 15 yr.old - to the 44 yr. old I am now. \\"The Best Is yet To Come\\"...Paula Serna, SAN JUAN BAUTISTA CA.
0393327345|4.0|The movie was gripping. If you've seen it, imagine slowing down each scene and focusing on each particle of the frame, one at a time. Shine a halogen lamp into the dark corners, examine each drop of blood under a microscope, turn over every particle of dirt till you know each bump on its surface. That's what it feels like the book is doing with a story you already know and experienced with a safety filter. The intensity is sometimes too graphic to bear. Initially the story carries you through in horrified fascination, unable as you are to look away. After awhile your insides start to feel bruised and sore and bleeding. I was glad when the story came to an end, it was such a blessed relief. And yet, do note, I didn't (couldn't) give up the book mid-way. Once you've begun, you're hooked. And that's SOMETHING to say for a book that competes with hundreds of others.    I am Joe's Resentful Awe. I am Jill's Grudging Respect.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Entiendo que todo depende de si uno es solo un simple fan de Avatar, o bien es un fan extremo de la misma.   Si es un simple fan, seguramente querrá tener todos los extras, bonus y special features del film, por lo que comprará la edición más completa y Ultimate Edition. Ahora si hablamos de un fan extremo y ansioso, seguramente no podrá esperar hasta noviembre y comprará esta versión ahora y luego la otra más adelante.   Y allí está el negocio del estudio Fox, lo cual es plenamente válido y entendible aunque algunos no estén de acuerdo, ya que no obligan a nadie a comprar, ni ahora ni más adelante. Simplemente se hacen dos ediciones una ahora y la otra con varios meses de demora, ya que el potencial de compradores de las 2 versiones es muy grande.   Lo que uno tiene que preguntarse entonces es si compra esta edición ahora, o controla su ansiedad para comprar la versión completa más adelante, o bien compra esta edición simple ahora y además compra la edición completa más adelante.   Es simplemente eso, nada más. Depende de la simple elección de cada uno, Fox no tiene la culpa y hace su negocio.   Un gran saludo a todos y buen año !!!.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|I am too annoyed to bother describing just how bad this disc is. The other one star raters hit the mark perfectly. Hopefully, few people will buy it after reading the reviews and the company will be forced to release a proper Blu-Ray transfer soon. I love this movie and have been waiting since I got a Blu-Ray player for it to be released. They should be ashamed to accept money for this disaster. What an insult.
B000056BOR|5.0|I have purchased this movie twice now over 15 years! I lost it and movies are my outlet, so I really need this hilarious and innocent story depiction. I am forever grateful to have this in my possession again!
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House takes you back to a point in time when lives were much harder than they are today, and brings the people who lived then to life.  The main characters in the book become like your own friends, and you truly feel the confusion, fear, anger, and resignation that plays such an important part in their story.    I opened the book and started reading, and read nearly a quarter of the book before I was forced to set it aside and deal with my own life, and the next day, I had to finish it.  There was no way I could go to sleep again, wondering what had happened...    It's not all sugary and sweet, and neither was life then, no matter what your race or station in life, as it starts with a small girl who had been suddenly orphaned on a ship full of immigrants and then callously torn from her sole relative, her older brother.  She is then dumped on the slaves owned by the ship's captain to be raised in the kitchen house that gives the book its title.  Terrified and alone in a strange country, the only people in her life offering affection and care are the black slaves, even though she's a young Irish girl.  The captain and his family seem to live in the lap of luxury, yet their lives are twisted up by fate and grief as well.  These twisted threads of all of their lives weave in and out through the book, and the ending was a great surprise.  (I won't spoil it!)     This book explores class, race, and social taboos, and then brings them to life in a uniquely clear way as you follow the heroine's life.  Their lives are clear, yet it isn't presented as a moral lesson, but rather just as it would have been to walk in their shoes, making the choices they made.    It seems well researched, there were no blaring errors that the average person would ever detect as far as the history involved is concerned.  The author implies that this was a \\"channeled\\" story--I don't know if it was or wasn't, but it's a good book, perfect for a lazy day along the pool, at the beach, orjust your favorite chair.     I definitely recommend this book!
0670021652|2.0|I bought Committed because I loved the book Eat, Pray, Love.  This, however was not anything like Gilbert's first book.  There is no plot.  It is the result of a divorced woman's obsessive research.  The book is more of a personal reflection than a story, and Gilbert appears insecure and whiney.  It is at times depressing, biased, and over-dramatic.  It is a good book to read if you're divorced and looking for someone to relate to, but otherwise not worth your money or time.
0312944098|5.0|We are avid readers.  This book was passed to us by a friend who told us it was one of the best books she'd ever read.  Both my husband and I read the book while on vacation in St. Martin and passed it on to some people we met there.  We both agree it's the best book we've read in a long time.    While in Florida this winter, we told a friend about it and he tried to borrow it from the local library without success.  So, I checked with Amazon, found & ordered the book, and gave it to him before we left there for NJ.  I believe he's reading it now and loving it.  :-)
B0017HEX76|3.0|Bought the Korean version (better price).  Info said that it had both English and Korean language available.  However, no menu was available to switch to English.  Only thing I missed was the director's comments, which were in Korean.  The music is great.
B002VECM72|5.0|This will be one of my all time favorite movies.  I just wish Hollywood would produce more movies like this and less of the blood & gore.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|I received my order earlier than what I expected which was awesome but I was expecting a REAL copy. Don't get me wrong, the DVD looked good on my television but I definitely can tell it was not the original DVD cover not the original DVD. My friends even could tell! I collect Disney movies and was disappointed in this one.
B0034C9CFK|4.0|I am neither a fan nor a detractor of Alan Jackson, but I know a freight train when I see one. Unfortunately the art department went wrong on the cover, as the Pennsy E series engine in Tuscan Red livery was a passenger department job. The darker Brunswick Green was the usual color for freight trains. While we are at it, why a Pennsy engine anyway? How about a Southern, a Dixie Flyer, or a Seaboard Airline engine [Through The Heart Of The South]? So I take one star off, but leave the rest to the fans of the music. Anyway, Bluegrass is the real train music!
B001OQCV2E|2.0|The positives are that this movie maintains suspense fairly well, and there are moments which succeed in tugging at your heart.  But there are many negatives:<br /><br />- While the acting isn't bad, the characters are cliches to the point of being flat caricatures.<br /><br />- When people were saying goodbye to their loved ones, the conversations were too short to be believable.  Surely, they would have wanted to say a lot more?<br /><br />- The special effects often look evidently fake (to my engineer's eye).<br /><br />- The frequent near-miss escapes from disaster strain credulity past the breaking point.<br /><br />- It's a bit odd how Americans are able to maintain authority over the situation even after all of the top leadership of the US government has been wiped out.<br /><br />- It makes no sense that the US president wouldn't have stayed with the group on the arks in order to provide continuing leadership.<br /><br />- I have serious doubts that the gears of the ark door could have been jammed so easily.<br /><br />- The building of the arks would have been funded by governments, not rich people.<br /><br />- The notion that a large burst of neutrinos would start interacting in a new way with other matter and greatly heat the earth's core is simply implausible.<br /><br />- Given all the uncertainties involved, how could they have predicted that the arks wouldn't have been destroyed by earthquakes or other natural events before being launched?<br /><br />- How did the himalayas get flooded?  Where did all that water come from?  I can't see a tsunami doing that.<br /><br />I could go on, but you get the point.  This movie wasn't worth the time it took to watch, even for mindless entertainment, so I'm giving it two stars and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I have been a Beatles fan for many years, when they were together and when they were apart, especially of George Harrison.  When I read the description and reviews of this CD on Amazon.com, I had to hear it for myself.  Now, I can't stop playing it!  I love the way the Martins have made the songs flow from one to another, and individualized portions of them.  There are certain songs where either the vocal tracks have been upped or some of the intrumental tracks have been left out, and you hear and realize again the magnificent harmony the Beatles had! My only desire now is to find a copy of the Cirque du Soleil Love on DVD - (I don't think it exists yet) - cause I'm going crazy trying to figure out what kind of moves they do to this music!!!  I don't think it would have been half this good if anybody other than Martin had worked on it - he really knew the Beatles' stuff and how to treat it!
B002U6CJCE|4.0|The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)<br /><br />1. Who is he? Luc Devereaux, the only remaining Universal Soldier (UNISOL) from the first experiment, who has now defected from his original assignment and destroyed the second generation (i.e. Bill Goldberg)<br />2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? For the first time ever, this is not a subplot.  This is much more serious than a personal vendetta.<br />3. Does he take his shirt off? A soldier doesn't take off his uniform, body armor, or camouflage.<br />4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No. :(<br />5. Is there a tournament? No.  :(<br />6. Is training needed for this tournament? Absolutely!  He has to shake off the rust since the last UNISOL fight.<br />7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? The splits come, but they're more of the split kick variety.<br />8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  For the purposes of this film, and this film only, the ball shot has been replaced with the throat slash...and it's outstanding.<br />9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? There are multiple patented kicks AND he beats the crap out of a morbidly obese guy in a Waffle House.<br />10. Is his enemy unbeatable? An upstart former Soviet Union country less significant than the others you've never heard of is hardly unbeatable, much less worrisome, especially for JCVD.<br />11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? He's given a nearly lethal dosage of psychotropic drugs, so that probably makes it more difficult.<br />12. Does he win? Cold War II averted<br /><br />After an armored vehicle abruptly abducts an anonymous teen pair at a museum, most of the plot is set.  When the same villains turn out to be disillusioned former Soviet soldiers intent on hijacking the left over nuclear capabilities of Chernobyl and unleashing some sort of third generation UNISOL (Andre Arlovski), the situation gets serious.  Consequently, some fictitious multinational faction - as if the UN had a military force - sends in sheep to the wolf (complete with four first generation UNISOL sacrificial lambs).<br /><br />Meanwhile, first generation UNISOL Luc Devereaux is undergoing therapy, has aged quite a bit, and has a nasty bump on his forehead.  We all know he's coming in to save the day, stop the Third Gen. UNISOL, and stop nuclear winter from creating a sub-species of Russians with pasty skin and three ears.  Will he succeed when the enemies have all the chips, and some secrets, on their side?<br /><br />Aside from the normal awesomeness of JCVD, this one is well worth the viewing for the action.  An extended fight scene between JCVD and Arlovski - who loses via TKO - is just ridiculously cool.  TONS of gun play, a close up shotgun blast through the head, and enough blood splatter from bullets and knives aplenty (JCVD is obviously a knife-fighting expert now) makes this one of the more exciting Van Damme flicks yet.mplete with four first generation UNISOL sacrificial lambs).

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Wonderful Movie. I didn't see any problems with the DVD and haven't been able to watch the Blu-ray version yet.  If your kinda stuck between Media like I am at the moment.  Then I think this is the version for you.  If you already have a Blu-ray player then I don't see the point in getting the DVD.  If you don't plan on getting a Blu-ray player then just buy the DVD.     Hope that helps.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I liked this movie a lot more the first time I saw it when it was called Dances with Wolves. Cameron hijacked that story, adjusted the color settings and tried hide a weak script and performances with special effects. You can put a pretty dress and make up on a pig but it is still a pig.
B0033AX26I|1.0|Okay, I adore Ry Cooder and love The Chieftains, but together on this album, they go totally wrong.  First of all, it was hard to really get behind the \\"theme\\" here.  Although the San Patricio Brigade here are hyped as being a band of tragic romantics, in reality they were hapless deserters.  Hard to feel the sympathy that the album demands.  In compiling and arranging the tracks, Cooder is all over the place.  The selections are not authentic to the time and place and they just don't build a cohesive, central story.  For example, \\"El Persecucion de Villa\\" is one of my favorite corridos, but was written almost 100 years after the events of the album and is about a totally different war.  The overall mood seems to be \\"Let's once again feel sorry for the poor Irish\\", while Cooder and the boys throw every sort of corny Irish and Mexican musical cliche into the mix.  The final track, where Paddy tootles along to \\"Cieito Lindo\\" and \\"La Raspa\\" is self-referential, insulting, and just plain wrong.    The Chiftains have already proven themselves more than adept at playing music that jumps ethnic boundaries. Ry is a grand master at spinning gripping tales through the musical medium.  Sadly, both parties fail mightily at this in \\"San Patricio\\".
B0021L8UPS|1.0|I will admit, I had low expectations coming into this movie, but I love horror.  There was just something about the previews that did not interest me.  The movie was on TV (free) so I decided to give it a chance.  The first time I watched it, I fell asleep after 20 minutes or so.  Okay, maybe it was just late and I was tired.  The next day, my wife and I saw that it was on again and my wife (not a horror buff) was interested to see it.  As we watched the movie, we began to easily predict what would happen next and it quickly became laughable.  I know that a movie is bad when I start to get up off the couch and do chores around the house...  After predicting just about everything that was happening, I began doing chores around the house...  UNFORTUNATELY, I made it back for the big ending.  Can you say worst freaking ending EVER!!!!!  I came in just as the bad guy from Quantum of Solace was saying \\"She is a Keeler (killer) Dwaaarf (midget), get out of da house!\\".  My wife and I literally erupted in laughter. I commented to my wife that we just invested 90 minutes of our time that we will NEVER get back, just to find out that this chick is a freakin killer dwarf....  Now I have seen it all.  I was waiting for Chucky to come running in to help her at the end (UGH!).  Please do not see this movie!!!!  Here is a super quick summary if you really want to know:  1. They adopt a little creepy girl who dresses weird and says she is from Russia    2. All kinds of bad things start happening  (Think Omen 4...)  3. 1 parent is basically being set up and framed to be the bad guy and the other parent is the clichéd moron who is complete denial of any wrong doing. Here is the type of thing to expect.   \\"Honey, the neighbor was found dead with an axe buried in his back!!!\\".  \\"Oh come on, dear he probably just backed into the wall where the axe was hanging and it accidentally got stuck in his back and killed him.  Crazy things happen like this all the time...\\"  4. 1 parent starts aninvestigation into the \\"child's past\\" and discovers that she is \\"a keeler dwaarf\\".  5. There is the typical cheesy fight scene in a dark house where the villain seems to have super strength and cannot seem to die. (You could hit her with a baseball bat, drop an anvil on her head, spray her with a flame thrower and she still keeps coming)  6. Villain goes down, the end.  This movie is crap and is a disgrace to killer dwarfs around the world!
6304698623|4.0|A Little Princess is based on the 19th century novel entitled \\"Sara Crewe: Or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's boarding school.\\" The story and most film versions are similar but have some intriguing differences including a happier ending which I prefer. This story is so popular that it has inspired several remakes. While this remake is by no means the /best/ I have seen, it is definitely quite entertaining and solid, and visually stunning, if a bit `kidified.'<br /><br />Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews)is a likeable young girl raised in India whose father is rich and leaves her at a boarding school in NYC to pursue a career in the army. Her unconventional outlook is quite different than the other girls her age who are all somewhat cowed by the two headmistresses.  Sara befriends several girls, and alienates Lavinia, Miss Minchin senior's favorite. After her father's assets are seized, Miss Minchin does the unthinkable- she forces Sara to become a servant. Sara's hard work and perseverance are not dampened by Miss Minchin's cruel treatment and endear even her worse enemies in the end.<br /><br />I felt the actress who played the young girls Sarah and Becky were quite well done, as well as Lavinia and Hermengarde. Miss Minchin's senior and junior were well portrayed. I felt the father's acting was rather weak, and did not like the change from London to New York which dampened the `Dickensian feel' that the original possesses.<br /><br />The school is a beautiful building, though, all shades of rich bottle green, and simply must be seen for the setting alone.<br /><br />*****Spoiler Section *******<br /><br />There were things I preferred that they do better<br />.<br />Miss Minchin's cruelty to Sara was never explained. I think they should've fleshed out this character a bit, to explain why she was so threatened by Sara and why she was so hard. Likely, she herself had been abandoned and left in a boarding school and had all her dreams and hopes dashed.<br /><br />The turnabout from Lavina at the end was also sort of `tacked on' and unbelievable. Bullies can and do change. But not without some reason. No reason is given.<br /><br />I felt the ending was silly with Miss Minchin becoming a chimney sweep.  That probably appeals to the small kids to see the `villain' punished, but I found it silly.<br /><br />The `princess mantra' got a bit much. I realize Disney made being a princess popular amongst kids, however I think it stereotypes girls and tells them they are `special no matter what' is simply not true. Everyone deserves life, love and happiness and you do not have to be anyone but yourself to get that.<br /><br />End Spoilers<br /><br />This is a solid work, sure to entertain kids and those who like \\"A Little Princess.\\"about from Lavina at the end was also sort of `tacked on' and unbelievable.

6302860253|5.0|This movie version of \\"Carmen\\" is not only the best \\"carmen\\" I have seen, but is also the best movie production of an opera that I have had the good fortune to see.        jULIA MAGINNES jOHNSON as Carmen is extremely sensuous in her portrayal, acting, as well as singing, in perfect pitch. The young and vital PLACIDO DOMINGO, is a delight to watch. The scenery and surroundings of Southern Spain are entrancing; they appear to be filmed in the city of Ronda, which is the way Seville must have looked in the century before last.  The cigarette factory girls, the gypsies and the bull fighters all have the look of reality, yet still romantic in the way that Bizet intended.

B00002DESX|5.0|I bought this album after listening to the Anthology CD. The only thing I can say, is that this CD was  worth the time I'd waited! When I first listened to this CD, I was blown away. Every time I listen to it, I think \\"Damn! This album is a MASTERPIECE! Those guys are the best band in the world!\\".  Today, I own every album of the Ramones, and I must say, EVERY ALBUM THOSE GUYS RELEASED IS AWESOME!\\".  The songs here are very fast, short and have really funny lyrics (for example: \\"...I used to make a living man, pickin' the banana...\\" - Havana Affair).  Trust me, after you'll listen to this amazing one, it'll make you start looking for the other albums.  This is one of the best records I've ever listened to, and it's absolutely one of my all-time favorites. And this is without a doubt, the best record by the Ramones.  P.S. Try to get this version over the remastered one.

1576754227|4.0|Apparently there is this saying that if you wake up and eat a live frog first thing in the morning, then that may be the worst thing that you do all day. I have never heard of that myself, but this book uses it as a motivational tool to stop procrastinating and start doing. Brian Tracy goes through 21 different ways in order to do everything you've been putting off (at least, do all the important things).    Honestly, 21 different ways is probably a little much. It's quite a short book and a quick read, but he easily could have boiled this down to maybe 10 different ways to motivate yourself. Each little chapter concludes with an \\"Eat That Frog\\" idea. It seems a little gimmicky, but if it works, then it doesn't matter.    Tracy's own life is quite impressive (at least what I could gather from the little autobiographical bits scattered throughout and the blurb on the book jacket). I think the main message of the book is that if you really want to achieve something, if you really have a goal in mind, you will never achieve it unless you start by doing something.

We can be paper-thin content-wise, but as long as we keep our four-star rating -- and keep negative reviews buried -- we'll continue to be \\"successful.\\" Classic.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had high expectations for this book. I really wanted to like it. But, let's face it: this book is not operating in the real world; it's operating in the 37Signals world. I'm happy they developed their company from scratch and have managed to keep it small and profitable. It is true what they say in the book that your company is more nimble and flexible when it is small. Growth is not only difficult to manage, it's difficult to maintain and even more difficult to sustain. They claim that the reason they've managed to stay small is because they won't compromise their principals and add things to their products THEY don't think their customers need. What they call the \\"simplicity\\" of their products, most people call the \\"limitations\\" of their products. But, if you look at the 37Signals products, you will see that they are horrifically over-priced. You get far less for your money than with many other comparable products. I should know. I've tried them all.<br /><br />And let's get something else out ofthe way too: this book IS NOT 288 pages long. Oh, there are 144 sheets of paper folded in half and glued into a book with writing on them to make it LOOK like there's 288 pages. But this book is really about 100 pages long. I read the entire book in about two hours -- and I'm a \\"meticulous\\" reader. Almost every other page is some sort of graphic. All the chapters end abruptly and within four or five pages (with the exception of one or two chapters).<br /><br />Yes, I teach at a business school. And, yes, business school theory is pretty much the antithesis of what is in this book -- or, rather, what is in this book is the antithesis of business school theory. That appeals to some people for its heretic value. But I can tell you that I also counsel budding entrepreneurs, and the theoretical foundation established in business school works for more people than the devil-may-care-let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may laissez-faire attitude purported in this book. It's common knowledge that the way to sell books is to buck conventional wisdom. Take the opposite point of view. That's fine if you want to write a book bucking conventional wisdom, but MAKE YOUR CASE. Don't fill a book full of platitudes, opinions and unsupported, unsubstantiated evidence (and using your own company as an example most of the time) and then expect us to swallow it without questioning it.<br /><br />In all fairness, one of the tenets of this book is to keep things simple. This book unabashedly attempts to make the case that the more you can simplify, the easier your life will be. Undeniably. But complexity and details are what the real world is made of. Following their own advice, everything in the book is stripped down to bare bones. They even say in the book that there was a wholesale reduction in the size of the book just before it went to print. I would have liked to have seen what they threw away. There might have been more substance, more detail -- and it might have been a more likable book.<br /><br />Instead, this book attempts to make the case for the following:<br /><br />* Don't work hard<br />* Don't plan for anything<br />* Don't have meetings<br />* Charge more (for less)<br />* Above all else, limit growth as much as possible<br />* Emulate drug dealers (not kidding)<br />* Follow your heart, not your customers (huh?)<br />* \\"Underdo your competition\\" (that's a direct quote)<br />* BAD-MOUTH YOUR COMPETITION (this might be the dumbest advice I've ever read in a book. Try this experiment sometime: go into a job interview and say extremely bad things about your former boss. Watch how fast you're shown the door).<br /><br />Some reviewers (and the book itself) have stated that this book is for new entrepreneurs. If you start a business of any substance and you follow the rules in this book, you will fail.<br /><br />And, $22? SERIOUSLY?? This book (and the pricing of it) is a metaphor for the entire 37Signals company: stripped down product, very little substance and a high price tag.<br /><br />Again, I hate that I hate it, because I really wanted to like it when I first started reading it. Two hours later, I was done with it and no smarter than I was when I started it.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|As a fan of the original, letme say again... a die hard fan!!! I had high expectations to the sequel. IT came out in theatres and i was not able to make the cut to see it in theatres unfortunately so I waited to see it on DVD/Blu-Ray. I read the reviews and talked to people that saw it and loved the first.. they hated it, said it did the first injustice, dont waste your time.. so I didnt... then I finally told myself that im going to just watch it and judge for myself. So I did and what I saw was an amazing film with an amazing story. does Eunice Bloom try to be Paul Smecker? to an extent yes.. they did try to have a quarky FBI agent to take his role, it can get a little cheezy sometimes with the way she says things and acts on the case, but understand she is Paul Smeckers hand picked replacement, so yeah she would need to be a little like him to be chosen by him.. understand? the boys have witty one liners throughout the movie that made me laugh my arse off the entire time. Romeo I think is a solid replacement for Rocco. I didnt like Rocco al lthat much in the first and I think Romeo does a solid job, as he is a tough La Razza kinda guy who doesnt take any crap, fits alot better than Rocco ever did (in my opinion). the bad guys in this film is where this film lacks the most, Yakavettas \\"new crime syndacite is weak at best and lack all the things to make them a good enemy to the Saints, they seem like push overs and characters taht you really dont care if they live or die. its when Il Duce ( the borthers father) story folds out when the main antagonist is revealed when i started to think... hey, now I like this story, and was attentive to the screen to see how it all played out, and it played out just fine, great ending and a FANTASTIC cliffhanger, almost better than the ending to the first.  ( i say almost because the court room scene and the speech thereafter is still my favorite climax to any movie i have ever seen). so get Boondock Saints 2 if you liked the first, get the second, it will not dissapoint you.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|until sony actually corrects the L2 and R2 triggers this is the best $5 bucks you can ever spend on a sony gaming product! inexpensive,simple to install and REALLY works!
B002UNMWAG|5.0|I think Boondock Saints is one of those movies you will either love or hate. No inbetween. I loved them both. Non-stop action and the realistic relationship between the two brothers (getting into a fight in the middle of a job) make this a great movie. Those of you who remember Billy Connelly from his stand up days will get a kick out of seeing him in this role.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Great fun for the little ones.  I have only had it about a month but so far it seems pretty durable and the kids love it.  I bought this playcenter at the same time as a regular inflatable pool as I have to kids 1 year and 4 year.  I thought the one year old would prefer this shallow paddling pool to the deeper pool. However, the spraying shower of water upsets her, so my 4 year old uses it more. It also has no plug in the bottom so is difficult to empty if you have much water in it.
B000007ODX|2.0|In 1975, when Barenboim could do no wrong in the eyes of British critics, he released a Chopin recording of the two great sonatas that was completely out of sync with the composer, and even the most craven reviewer was forced to concede that the playing was \\"a bit\\" off. By 1982, when this set of Nocturnes was released, the Gramophone had grown bolder and began to call a spade a spade: :Barenboim conveys no impression of identity with any of these pieces. How is it possible to perform the opening page of Op. 27 No. I without any evident sense of the music's mystery?\\"<br /><br />There's really not much to add. As both pianist and conductor, Barenboim feels that he is up to performing any piece by any composer, it seems, and unfortunately, that results in accomplished run-throughs when he is off form. the lack of any real feeling for Chopin's music must be obvious to everyone but him. The only good thing I can say is that this CD isn't as blunt and faceless as some of his earlier outings. to be avoided.
B0000009SM|5.0|The album that introduced me to Zappa. I love all eras but this is still one of my very favorites. Frank had said that this was his favorite group to have perform his music because they could do anything that he demanded of them. Production is amazing given the time of recording! YOU MUST GET THIS!
0307454541|2.0|This story is well crafted.  I will give Larsson credit for that.  Otherwise this is a dark, disturbing, brutal book and I wish I had not read it.  I wonder why this is so popular among so many people when a good portion of it is senseless, graphic violence and sexual brutalization and then the pondering of good and evil just to give the characters some type of philosophical edge.  After reading this, I don't want to have anything to do with any movies or books in the series.  Actually, one of the critics gives away a major plot line of the book right on the first page, and I should have known right there what the story was about. The original Swedish title of the book pretty much sums it up \\"Man Som Hattar Kvinnor,\\" \\"Men Who Hate Women.\\"
B0014JKJHK|2.0|I bought these shoes because I stand on my feet all day in a kitchen. I was hoping that they would make my feet feel better, but they don't. My feet still hurt every day and only a few hours into my day. They are literally throbbing as I am typing right this moment. I am definitely going to try another pair of shoes from another manufacturer since these are NOT working.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who is three.  She squealed when she saw it and wanted to, \\"borrow it and bring it back tomorrow\\".  I saw it three weeks later...according to Mom, she watched it every night for all that time.<br /><br />If your daughter (grand) is into princesses, get this one.  It is the Bomb.
B000AL730O|5.0|What an album! Macca's best since Flowers in the Dirt and better than Flaming Pie. It's a slow build but once it hooks you, this album seeps into your consciousness. I adore this record. How does he do it? From Canberra, Australia I salute you Sir Paul.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|These knives are just plain simple. 1/4\\" thick steel blades, full tang. I think you could use it as a climbing piton if you had to, they're that sturdy.    They are a bit heavy compared to thinner knives. But that weight helps when you need to use it to chop something.    For the price, they will be hard to beat. I don't think there are any other knives in this class available for such a good price.     The sheath is simple, but nice.     The handle scales are removable, which is a good feature in case you get dirt under them and need to clean the knife. Another advantage to removable scales is that you can easily replace them with wood, micarta, bone or antler scales if you want to dress the knife up a bit. This would make a good \\"project\\" knife for those who like to tinker and build their own sheaths and handle scales.
B002ZG983M|5.0|The movie KICK ASS lives up to it's title. It's another movie based off a comic book. I wouldn't even call it a super hero movie, because it really wasn't one. It was a action, comedy that mixed in some drama.<br /><br />The story is easy to follow, a unpopular kid named Dave Lizewski(Aaron Johnson). One day he thinks why hasn't anyone tried to be a super hero before. So he decides to become one and Kick Ass is born. The comedy follows, as one early scene he tries to find a cat by show the picture to random people in his costume. Eventually he gets in over his head and runs into Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl(Chloe Moretz). Things get more serious, but the movie never leaves what it's best at it's comedy.<br /><br />I won't give more of the story away, so I'll move on to the acting and actors which was great. Though for me two stole the whole movie. First Nicolas Cage was simply great. His best movie since LORD OF WAR. Then there was Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. This was a dangerous role playing a child who's killing people. I'm sure there's some in the media who will be appalled, but it's just a movie it has no bearing on society or the down fall of it. Chloe did a outstanding job blending he childishness with cold and calculating killer. The best was her chemistry with Cage, you could just tell they enjoyed working together and were having fun.<br /><br />The action and directing by Matthew Vaughn was extremely well done.  The music was also really good.<br /><br />Kick Ass is the best movie of the year for me so far. I highly recommend this movie, I really don't think you'll be disappointed.  I plan on seeing it again.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I read a review of another fan and thought, since his assessment said every thing that I was thinking, that I'd shamelessly post it here:    \\"Once the package is opened, you find two amazing CDs and a little book. The book opens with an essay by Natalie who explains what a lot of time and work went into this project. If anyone tried to discourage her, she makes no mention of it. She does talk about poetry. She talks about poetry like a poet. This album is a work of love, plain and simple. Natalie's choices for the album are brilliant. She excavates and brings to light the obscure and adds more light to poets already known. But as we know even the biggest poets in the world walk about in relative obscurity. Who would recognize the poet laureate, Billy Collins, if he came to our door? This is the way of poets and poetry. It sure isn't about money. It's a calling. Natalie shows here that she is part of that group of people who let go of themselves and puts words to the things that are beyond words. This album may be a disappointment to some who want pure Natalie-Natalie songs, but I believe  the Natalie fan who liked the Hiro or the Shaker shows, will fall in love with this new work by Natalie and company. The songs and the arrangements are in four words: all over the place. Klezmer music, ballads, folk, jazz, and on and on. I am not qualified to write about it at length. It's just one heck of an assortment of musical styles. Natalie the self described shy  girl, stretches to connect with an amazing group of musicians to make a rich and many layered poetry cake with bitter and sweet frosting.    I urge any Natalie fan to run out and get this asap.  I also urge anyone who likes this new work to spread the word. Even with the apparent marketing genius that's gone into this, the best marketing is word of mouth. Maybe give a copy to your library or at least let them know it's available and ask them to buy it? Ask your bookstore or music shop to stock it. Buy a copy for your mother for mother's day. Buy a copy for your lover just because. And whatever you do, Do leave your sleep.     I am going to a poetry reading tonight. I am going to be reading one of these poems.\\"  […]
0393072231|5.0|Like a lot people, I am wondering how we got into this current economic crisis. If you are looking to get the 'gory details' on this, you might want to look elsewhere. Lewis's focus is on certain people behind the crisis, rather than what happened when and why (although some of that detail is in there, as it must be). If you are wondering what the people behind the mess are like, what makes them do the things they do, this is a good place to start.
006112429X|5.0|Lionel Shriver's craftsmanship in horror is stunning. We Need to Talk About Kevin is as gripping a horror story as anything Stephen King has ever written. supernatural entities are nowhere near as frightening as Eva and Franklin's Kevin, the ultimate bad seed and evil spawn. His mental illness is denied by his Regan Republican father, and agonized over by his mother, who would rather be anywhere else than with her son, and for good reason. Kevin exits the womb with a vengeance that seems inborn. He is scary as an infant, upsetting as a toddler, dangerous as a child, a tornado warning of an adolescent, and lethal as a teenager. But it is Shriver's rich writing that kept me on edge and coming back. Her mind is a beautiful, endless treasure chest of gems; she is as good a writer as I've ever read.<br />One cannot help but get the feeling that if we're not careful, this will end up as the great American novel. There are Kevins all over the landscape, highly intelligent and extremely damaged, with parents who are clueless as to their simmering, toxic agendas that explode into unthinkable violence. Shriver takes pains in discussing the other baby lunatics who have made our society pockmarked with bullet holes and ineffable agonies. But kevin has his own style of volcanics, and like a good detective thriller, Shriver builds to a climax that is shocking, but no surprise.<br />Kevin's mother, Eva, is a dynamic business woman, professional traveler, and confused parent, infected with doubt about her motherhood. As her son's diabolical inclinations become apparent, there is nobody to say, \\"we're all a little ambivalent at times, dear.\\" Eva is quite alone in her suspicions, which are only echoed by the parents of Kevin's continual victims, not the least of which is his own sister, Celia, the Madonna to his anti-Christ. Celia is as weak and gentle as Kevin is evil, providing a more conventional mother-daughter relationship for Eva. But the momentum of Kevin's fatal path seems indomitable; he is too bad to live, and little golden haired Celia is far too good. Shriver is so surgical with this daunting contrast, carefully and incrementally building a history that has an inevitable conclusion. She isn't coy about it either. We know what to expect; we just don't know the extent of the horror.<br />Whenever I read a chapter of this book, I felt compelled to hug my 23 year old son. This book is soul infecting, with the resonance of American tragedy and the true horror of the unstoppable, which is perhaps the scariest part. Lionel Shriver is too brilliant and interesting to miss, especially this book, which is extraordinary.le; he is too bad to live, and little golden haired Celia is far too good.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|It can be difficult even reviewing a Michael Moore film, because people tend to have a strong reaction to the man's very name, let alone his work. Objectivity can be difficult, because Moore is not exactly subtle with his political and social stances, or really with much of anything else. In that regard Capitalism is much like his other works, in that he employs a mixture of historical footage, personal interviews, grandstanding publicity stunts and loaded voice-overs to make his points. I suspect much of how one responds to Moore's work greatly depends upon how close one's politics are to the filmmaker's. Fortunately for me, mine line up almost a hundred per cent.     Moore's target this time is to attempt to answer the question, \\"what the hell went wrong with America?\\" And the answer is, to distill a two-hour movie down to a single word, greed. He traces the unleashing of the greed culture (spurred on by guess which president, and no, it's not Nixon?) through its development in the last three decades, all culminating with the damage it's doing the country now. As with all Moore pieces, he also shows some small pockets of brave citizens doing their part to resist the tide of corporate greed and inhumanity, and like his other works his most effective scenes are where he interviews the victims (a family who is paid a thousand dollars to clean out their own foreclosed home make especially troublesome watching).    There's little I can add in the way of an actual review - most people are aware of how Michael Moore makes films and what his agenda is, save that here (like in his book Dude, Where's My Country?) he's trying to wake people up into action. How successful that will be, I don't know; we are after all largely a nation of dead-eyed suburbanites who, to quote 1776, would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor. And no doubt there are (predominantly) conservatives who are pooh-poohing this film and waving their Tea Partysigns while they scream about encroaching socialism; but if your brain isn't completely closed to logic and reason and you wondered why America's in such a dismal state, well, this movie will explain it to you simply and clearly. Rarely have I seen such a direct distillation of what is wrong with this nation so straightforwardly expressed; if I had any say, I'd make this film required viewing. That might expose some people to ideas that don't conform to their belief system, I guess, but if even one person has his mind opened by watching this film, then Moore has done his job. But, just like most Moore films, the people who really need to see it never will simply because it has his name on it.
0694003611|3.0|cute book...great pics...but it didn't catch my 5 month olds attention...maybe later :)...still recommend....son loves Sandra Boynton's \\"Going to bed book\\"....probably cause I've been reading that one to him since he was 1 week old :).
B000068IEU|5.0|This is an impressive initial serving of the type of maverick filmmaking that Craven became well noted for in the 70s. While the violence, torture, and sexual sadism depicted is quite visceral, the underlying message about the nature of repressed violence existing in the \\"everyman\\" comes through like a force of nature. Great addition to the collection of any die hard horror film addict. Certainly complements my Wes Craven collection!

1595141715|5.0|Imagine you've come home and a surprise package is waiting for you.  You're a high school boy, no money to order anything and it's not your birthday.  You're excited opening the book only to discover seven cassette tapes inside.      Cassette tapes -- nothing in the house will even play them, but your Dad has an old stereo out on his workbench in the garage.  Listening, you hear the voice of a ghost -- Hannah Baker, one of your classmates and a girl you could easily love.  Only a few weeks ago, she committed suicide.     The thirteen sides of the tapes (the last side is blank) take Clay Jensen a night to hear. They include a map, so he can follow along. He learns of the thirteen reasons--and thirteen people--whose actions contributed to Hannah's death. Clay is one of those people and he dreads learning what part he played in this tragedy. Along the way, he discovers hard truths about his classmates and himself.      I picked up this book solely on Sherman Alexie's recommendation.  Alexie's The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian  is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read.  I don't think any young adult library should be without a copy.  I'm adding 13 Reasons Why  to that list.     Rebecca Kyle, April 2010

B001NLKT60|5.0|The Publishers Weekly review for the Hornet's Nest book due to come out includes the ending of this book.  OK, now that I got that out of the way, this is a suspenseful and entertaining book.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the 1st of the series; it is good to read that one 1st for more back-story and character development.
006117758X|4.0|This book explains alot about Charles Bukowski's youth and gives explanation to his cynical ( or is it truthful?) view of life. I believe this book is mainly auto- biographical and it deals with his relationship with his cruel father, his terrible case of acne and his life as a young man up until his early twenties. I would not say it is Bukowskis best work (I prefer his short stories), however this book has a sense of completeness and cohesiveness which is not always present in his other work. This book could be a very good introduction to Bukowski's work as it is very readable and enjoyable.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|My recent purchase of a \\"Grand Torino\\" CD met all my expectations. It arrived on time and in great shape!
0802798225|5.0|This book is amazing.  I love getting the two point of views that are completely different and poetic in their own right.  Brittany is easy to identify with- being the good girl and trapped with horrid parents and a mentally challenged sister.  When dangerous Alex Fuentes basically takes over her life and harasses her into liking him- the banter is beliveable and addicting.  My niece brought this book over and I read it overnight.  It's an amazing read and fun.  It will crave you wanting more!  Pick up the sequel 'Rules of Attraction' now!
B0015XHQTY|3.0|The acting, script, cinematography and editing are all so bad here, they almost make this Dirty Harry relic good. Eastwood's performance plays tongue-in-cheek today, though he may have been serious at the time. Tyne Daly as the rookie partner is simply awful. The plot about revolutionaries taking the SF mayor hostage is very dated even for 1976. The film overall looks like a TV show. I did like the jazzy 70s soundtrack, usually good when Eastwood, a jazz fan, is involved. I liked looking at the 70s cars.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|This and \\"Warehouse 13\\" are the BEST new shows on TV. PERIOD. Excellent characters ( I love Walter the best), excellent chemistry, and excellent \\"X-file\\" style stories. I can't get enough. The only thing I hate is that there is more than 1 offseason as they split up the broadcasting into segments, for example, they will show maybe 6 new episodes, than they take about a month off before they show another 6 new episodes etc.
0385333846|1.0|This book has been on my TBR list for a while, but I just recently got around to reading it. Now I'm wondering what all the hype is about.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse is marketed as an anti-war novel. Honestly, I don't see the point. The book is basically a disjointed narrative that follows Billy Pilgrim, a man unstuck in time.<br /><br />Much like The Time-Traveler's Wife, this book follows the main character as he hops through time. The problem with this book however is that there is nothing to tie the time lines together. There is no stability, just a jump from one time to another, to another, to another, and so it goes.<br /><br />Then the narrative \\"jumps the shark\\" by sending Billy not just through time, but space- to an alien planet in outer space.<br /><br />I can't see where the anti-war theme emerged or made a prominent statement. To me it just seems like an ad ploy to sell another book
0783231032|5.0|I can't help myself -- I LOVE this movie.  I think it's one of those flicks you either love or absolutely despise.<br /><br />From the opening sequence (a hysterical send-up of the \\"Jaws\\" opening) to the final crazy madness, I couldn't stop laughing.  Yes, the story is ridiculous (the \\"love story\\" especially is kind of dumb, and the \\"sex only in an airplane\\" is just stupid), but from what I've heard from older family members who lived in that part of the world in 1941, the movie accurately depicts the attitudes of many folks -- the near hysteria over possible additional attacks, the civilian look-outs, etc.  OK, so maybe it's a *little* exaggerated in this movie, but it was very real at the time.<br /><br />Everyone's sense of what's funny and what isn't is different, so this will definitely not appeal to EVERYONE.  But I count it among my favorite movies -- along with \\"A Letter to Three Wives,\\" \\"Raising Arizona,\\" \\"Singing in the Rain,\\" and \\"Joe vs the Volcano.\\"
0393312836|1.0|I read this one to get it off my TBR list. It's been hanging out there for a while, but I've never really attempted to read it before. I found that completing the book was a challenge for me.<br /><br />The writer of this book uses lots of colloquial phrasing and made-up language. Most readers can figure out the meaning of the words from their usage, however some readers will get frustrated and choose not to undertake the challenge.<br /><br />The book is somewhat violent, following Alex, a 15 year old through the streets as he and his friends beat and rape innocent people. They break into houses and steal from whoever is unlucky enough to be in their path.<br /><br />Some people categorize this book as a science fiction dystopian novel. Big words that basically mean it's set in the future. However in reading this book, I can see that it might fit in any time period. I was reminded of The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. I can imagine youth of the 50s and 60s acting this way, just as I knew a few youth who in the 80s and 90s acted this way.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the book. I feel a sense of accomplishment for finishing it, but also disappointment that it was such a waste of time.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|For years the movie going public has been fed one of its long term staples, the western, as a story of good versus evil, purity versus villainy, the stalwart angelic hero versus the dirty nasty bad guy. From Roy Rogers and Gene Autrey to James Stewart and Henry Fonda, the good guys remained pure for the most part. But that sort of short changed history.<br /><br />Good guys were there to uphold the law but at the same times on occasion made the laws to suit their needs. And if they were to break the law, who was there to stop them? And so it goes that while this breed of hero was portrayed as pure in film, the reality was that they weren't quite as nice a good guy as we were led to believe.<br /><br />That being said, they were good guys. They did protect people. They did uphold the laws brought about by people in towns across the West. And of course, they did kill people. So where does that leave the movies when it comes to depicting the old west and its heroes?<br /><br />We've either been given the glossed over examples seen most recently in TOMBSTONE (great movie by the way) or we've been given the good guys who are really bad in films like THE WILD BUNCH. But now and then we get a gem of a film that portrays these men of the West for who they actually were, a combination of the two. APPALOOSA is such a film.<br /><br />Produced by, directed by, screenplay by and starring Ed Harris, the film is a more realistic look at the old West than most have offered. The film opens with a Marshall going out to the ranch of Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) to arrest two of his men for a murder in town. Bragg refuses to release these men and as the Sheriff and his deputies attempt to arrest them, he shoots and kills them all.<br /><br />With no where to turn, the folks of Appaloosa turn to Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his friend Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) to help them. Gunslingers, ex-soldiers and previous lawmen, Cole and Hitch do what they do better than anyone. They take on the responsibilities of the town by inflicting their own rules, all of which are of benefit to the townsfolk and not greeted warmly by lawbreakers. Cross the line and you take the chance of being taken down by them both.<br /><br />As the town's new Marshall and deputy, they decide that the best way to take Bragg in for the killing of the Marshall (and Cole's old friend) is to take him by surprise, which they do. Of course Bragg's men attempt to stop him but back down when faced with no choice. Now it's up to a judge to convict Bragg.<br /><br />While all of this is going on Allison French (Renee Zellwegger), a young widow, moves into town. Catching the eye of Cole, the pair becomes inseparable. At the same time, Miss French seems to have a roving eye for Hitch as well. But, being the friend he is, Hitch rebukes her advances and holds his tongue for the sake of his friend.<br /><br />The judge arrives and a guilty sentence is passed. On the train ride to take Bragg to prison for execution, it's jumped by gunslingers Bragg has hired, both old acquaintances of Cole. With Allison as a hostage, they escape but not for long as Cole and Hitch track them down, only to find a surprise waiting for them (nope, no spoiler here for some of you).<br /><br />The President of the United States, an old friend of Bragg, commutes his sentence and things in Appaloosa change. Loyalties alter, the desires of the town's city fathers changes and Cole and Hitch find themselves still enforcing the law but with a bit of a jaundiced eye. It's only a matter of time before a final showdown, a final confrontation and a fitting end to the twisted tales that revolve around one another come to a conclusion. And it's not what you might expect.<br /><br />The movie plays well, offering a realistic glimpse of the old West. It doesn't sugar coat it but at the same time offers tribute to what it was as well. One need not go for the creased jeans of Roy Rogers but at the same time sink into the whiskeyaddled minds of the Wild Bunch. Instead we have a combination of the two and a more telling tale of those who dared to enforce the law by any means necessary.<br /><br />Harris does a fantastic job, especially for wearing so many ten gallon hats while making this film. His character is a violent man who longs for more peaceful times. But this doesn't mean his anger won't flare on occasion. Mortensen has become a force to be reckoned with in his own right as an actor over the years. His portrayals of heroes from the Rings trilogy to this film offer more complex heroes than we've been offered in the past. And everything increases in value because of this. Irons does bad guys like no one else. You seriously want to be the one to take him down. The weakest of the leads here is Zellweger who for me just doesn't feel believable to me.<br /><br />The film feels like a combination of the old and the new, the story of a good guy who might not be so good on the outside but whose heart helps in a lawless land. It tells the tale of a dedicated friendship that plays between the main characters. And it offers that glimpse of the West in action and location that makes you wish you had the chance to explore the hills and towns seen. Its perhaps one of the best westerns I've seen in ages and ranks among the best ever. For fans of the genre, this is one not to miss.d a more telling tale of those who dared to enforce the law by any means necessary.

B003405MF6|5.0|Hey folks - gots to plug the new Jeff Beck: Emotion & Commotion. Get the cd/dvd set if you can. The dvd is the superb Crossroads set from 2007. The cd is pure virtuosity. The mellow melodic Beck rules this one. A coupla rockers (Hammerhead) but mostly melodic orchestral stuff. Some classical, some chick singers. I'm bustin' on this one. As the great Horowitz once said, exactly what I wanted to hear, 'cept I didn't know it 'til I heard it. Amen.
0307454541|4.0|This was my book club pick for last month.  I found it so intriquing that I ordered the second and third in the series.  It had several unique features in the plot and I was completely spellbound until the actual murderer was exposed...very chilling diabolic killer....left a lot of unanswered questions that I hope will be explored further....
B001WCN232|5.0|A lot of people have been complaining about the fact that \\"p*ssy\\" line on the song \\"Star Star\\" is edited on the remastered CD version of this album.  This may be the case, but anyone interested in the MP3 version of this album being sold on this website should know that the song is complete and unedited... does this mean that the version is the older remaster?  I'm not quite sure, having nothing to compare it with.  It sounds fine to me...  for those coming here to vent (and baby, I don't blame you!), it might be worth just downloading the track if you bought the remaster and are feeling ripped off.<br /><br />Anyway, those interested in the album and are scared away from cries of censorship (often a deal breaker for myself as well) can go ahead and purchase the MP3 version without worry.  It's a fine album, but then you probably already knew that.

0312370849|4.0|Sarah's Key is a story of a pre-teen Jewish girl living in France during the Nazi uprising in Europe juxtaposed against a story of a 45 year old American Journalist living in France investigating in French/German round ups of 1942.      At first the story alternates chapters taking place with Sarah in 1942 and Julia in in 2002, but eventually only features Julia's investigation of the life and death of Sarah.      The story in it's essence is very interesting, and showcases a piece of European history that most people know little about.  I myself was shocked to find out that France played such an active part in rounding up and detaining of the Jewish people living in France. I think the best thing about this book is that it got me interested in doing my own research and learning more about these events.      I'm not such a huge fan of the voice/style Tatiana de Rosnay writes in.  Sometimes she would go on and on about things that seemed unimportant, but it wast consistent...almost like she realized the story was too straight forward and felt the need to suddenly spend 3 pages describing the characters deepest emotions using different words to say the same thing repeated over and over.      These things were annoying but not so bad that i wouldn't read this book or even recommend it to a friend.  So if you want to read something with a unique historical perspective and don't mind a bit of \\"fluff\\" here and there read it!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is an awesome and uplifting movie that can be enjoyed by all ages.  We've watched it several times now and loved it each time.  We need more movies like this one!

B000GZX4YS|3.0|Camus could sweep through a volume of philosophy with one razor edged sentence.<br />I may not agree with all his perspectves, but I do give him the credit of genius.<br /><br />This september (not january) 1954 'Vintage Books' edition has gained a collectors cult following (If only for the haunting cover).  But the reason escapes me.  certainly the disaffected void hangs heavily throughout this story.  It's unrelenting grip of dread holds the reader tightly.  But personally I feel this translation lacks the true Camus ambience.
B003405MF6|1.0|Stay away from this CD if you're a fan of the Jeff Beck who brought us \\"Blow by Blow,\\" \\"Wired,\\" \\"There and Back,\\" \\"Guitar Shop,\\" \\"Jeff,\\" \\"You Had It Coming\\" and \\"Live at Ronnie Scott's.\\" This new CD is a snoozefest compared to any of them. This CD should have been called something like \\"The Mellow Moods of Jeff Beck,\\" but even the word \\"mellow\\" suggests there's more energy in this music than there is.    Seriously: Beck playing around with \\"Over the Rainbow\\" doesn't belong on a CD. It's best left to his six-string musings in his living room. The problem with this song is the problem that plagues most of this disc: He doesn't sound emotionally engaged. I'm a fan of the Jeff Beck whose guitar squawks like a squeezed cat with fireworks shooting out of its a**; the Jeff Beck who sounds as if he has eight fingers on each hand because no one could possibly play what he does with just five fingers on each hand. There's almost none of it on this disc. And when he does try to amp it up with \\"Hammerhead,\\" he apparently forgets that some of us are old enough to remember Hendrix's \\"Voodoo Chile (Slight Return).\\"    I paid a small fortune for a pair of tickets to see Beck this summer. If he plays any of this stuff, I'm going to feel cheated.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Having just seen Bonamassa and his band last night at the Town Hall Theater in New York City, I can truthfully say that the only thing better than this DVD is seeing him in person.  Quite simply, there has been no one even remotely like him since Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix.  (Yes, Hendrix was a great blues guitarist -- many younger fans don't know that.)  But any comparisons are misleading, because Bonamassa is, as BB King has said, \\"one of a kind.\\"    Other reviewers have given you all the details -- I can only add that any serious blues collection is incomplete without this DVD and at least a couple of Bonamassa's albums (I recommend Black Rock and Live From Nowhere in Particular).    But go see him yourself too, while he is still playing relatively small venues, and while tickets are relatively easy to find.  It won't be like that much longer.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|At first listen, I thought that this album was a little underwhelming.     The more you listen to it, the more you will like it.     It is a work of art,  but sometimes it takes a little time before you recognize a work of art ( such as this album ) even when it is right in front of you.       The songs all have a deep meaning to them,      and the acoustic \\" old-fashioned \\" style is a welcome change to anyone who is tired of the \\" modern country sound \\" '            Honestly one of the best recent country albums I've heard.    Just give it some time, don't publish a review after one listen, and say how bad it was..... because you haven't heard this album until you've listened to it at least ten times.         With this album, Emmylou proves that she still has a lot to say,  and she \\" says \\" it in the most wonderful, timeless way that she could.
B002VZC9CY|1.0|I'm SO thankful that Natalie is back, but it's not what I was hoping for.  Based on these \\"select\\" songs, I won't be buying the full 2-CD set.     I want to hear Natalie sing; I don't want to hear a bunch of seemingly random dudes talk.     If you liked House Carpenter's Daughter, buy this CD - you might like it.     If you're expecting something like 10,000 Maniacs, Tigerlily, and Ophelia, don't buy it.
B003102JDM|2.0|If you love the Coen brothers you probably won't be reading these before deciding whether to watch or not. If you're not familiar with them than you should not start with this film. The movie has a good openning scene with an old Jewish couple living in 18th century Europe. They end up with a curse struck down upon them.<br />Then we are in present day Minnesota with a physics teacher and family man who is a descendant of the old couple(or maybe just another jew in another time). His life starts falling apart with one unfortunate event after another as he lets everyone in his life walk all over him. The movie continues with the usual Coen dark comedy. The ending is abrupt and stupid. I'm all for satire, but all the stereotypes get to be a bit much.  The Coens could have done a better job with this one.
055358894X|4.0|This is really a book about organized crime.  Think Al Capone.  Or think some swanky British gangsta film, like \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\", or \\"The Limey\\".  Throw in a medieval backdrop built on the fossils of some alien race and you will understand the book's genre.  A melange of everything.        For those of you who are hell bent on magic, be forewarned, you'll find none until page 250 of the book.   The author's pacing of the novel can be compared to a steam engine that has just left the train station at the top of the hill.  The plot starts rather slow, but gets better and better and faster and faster.      I highly recommend; especially to those who put up with the multiple story lines methodically found in Sanderson's \\"Elantris\\".
B002ZG983M|5.0|What a great time at the movie!  This has it all, it's funny, has great lines, decent plot and fantastic characters.<br /><br />The Plot is that an average high school wonders why nobody stands up for anyone being hurt or abused.  He doesn't have any super powers, and feels that it's not really needed to fight crime, and he's right.  As it turns out there are to others who feel the same way he does: Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  Also Red Mist.  I don't want to say why or how they join forces because I don't want to spoil anything.<br /><br />The characters are fantastic. I liked how we get into Kick Asses mind at one point he feels he should give up his alter ego, because it's a waste of time, and it's not fun any more.  Kick Ass was a decent character to have, but he wasn't the only one.<br /><br />Big Daddy, was a very interesting character. When you see Big Daddy, pay attention to his speech pattern. It's exactly like Adam West Did for Batman. That was such a nice touch. I also like the how Cage played his character, and then how he changed that character for Big Daddy.  It was a very nice job.<br /><br />Hit Girl, my favorite!!  She stole the movie and did it with a smile on her face.  By far, she was the best. She had the best lines, and the best actions scenes. When I say she can clean house, trust me on it.  This was a fantastic character.  She had the most violent scenes, and had a potty mouth, but for me, that's what added to the humor of it.  Hit Girl was fantastic, and I hope she has her own movie!  Hit Girl rocks!<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the movie and had a fun time with it.  It held my attention for the 2 hours, and didn't check my watch once.  It has a lot of action, great music/songs in it and some of the best editing I've seen in a while. It was also wonderfully written and acted.  This is what a movie should be. Now, this was a violent one. Don't be fooled into thinking it's for kids, cuz it's not. Lot of violence and some pretty naughty language, and I mean naaaaaaughty.<br /><br />This is a fantastic popcorn movie. If you go, I'm sure you'll like it as much as I did.  I can't wait for it to come to Blu-Ray!<br /><br />I hope that Hit Girl gets her own movie!s a fantastic popcorn movie. If you go, I'm sure you'll like it as much as I did.  I can't wait for it to come to Blu-Ray!    I hope that Hit Girl gets her own movie!

B0037W68F4|1.0|In early february I heard that MGMT had a new album coming out and immediately i went to their website to check it out.  Being a big fan of music with some life, I went ahead and purchased this album without even a listen.  A few months went by and the album finally came in the mail.  Not only was the cover art one of the most atrocious things I have yet to encounter in my short 29 year lifespan, but the album left me bored and waiting for MGMT to show up.  Well, the first decent song did not come until the 7th track \\"brain eno\\", out of 9 tracks. And it would only be one of two songs worth hearing, followed by the exit song \\"congratulations\\". MGMT let me tell you, if you did an album with the same style that the first album had, you may have felt like sell-outs or remorse for not doing an artistally legitimate album, but guess what?  Who ever produced oracular spectacular, \\"congratulations\\" you have a porfessional grasp of how to make a cohesive album.  MGMT on the other hand, are just a bunch of bored musicians wishing for the return of crappy 70's music to regain its stature and popularity.  If you loved the first album, don't waste your time with this \\"artistic\\" album, its freshman.
B002ZTIIXK|3.0|I was expecting a lot more from these CDs. I was kind of dissapointed. I enjoyed only 4 songs out of the entire repertoire. k.d. lang has such a powerful and beautiful voice. She needs to come up with newer songs along the line of Constant Craving, Hallelujah, and Hush Sweet Lover. All these songs are out of this world!!!
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Great book.  A lot of good information in there that helped define my feelings toward religion.  I don't agree with everything he has to say, but what book does anyone?  I especially like his extension in the later version that answered some of the critical arguments for the book.  I felt that was a great way to end it.  Overall, this book discusses exactly what the title says.  It bashes the irrationality of religion well offering some ways to becoming more rational (these are some of the things I disagree with).  The best testimony for how good this book is would be the level of attention it has received in the press and elsewhere.  The fact that there are so many reviews for it is also a great indicator of what a good read it really is.  One bit of advice though would be to go into the book with an open mind if you are a very religious person.
B0035V35PI|5.0|I highly enjoyed this movie in theaters and couldn't wait to get it on BluRay to watch over and over again at home. I liked the stylized blood and the flow of action. Even the story was above par for me given that I've watched sooo many kung fu and ninja movies that are severely lacking in that area. I think this movie caught too much flack for the plot by reviewers who this movie was obviously not catered to.    I found that the character development for Raizo was great...showing him as a child, teenager and adult... Mr. Rain is someone I'd like to see more of in the future! I wont lie that I enjoyed this movie probably more that i should have due to him! Sho Kosugi was simply great in this movie as well and I definitely have to go back and re-watch his old ninja movies now!!!    I enjoyed the deleted scenes and the featurette on turning Rain into an actor star. You can see just how hard he trained for this movie. Great purchase I must say!    When I go to see/buy a movie, I go with the expectation of being entertained and coming out feeling good, telling all my friends and family about the great movie I just saw..and that was definitely the case with Ninja Assassin!

B00000JLWW|2.0|As a recent subscriber to Netflix, I finally got around to watching Titanic. At the time of its release, I had heard both plaudits for and censure of this film, one of the most celebrated in the history of the Academy Awards. The movie left me with an impression analogous to my assessment of the Harry Potter novels: to quote the eponymous subject of the masterful film Capote, \\"I don't understand what the fuss is all about.\\"<br /><br />Simply put, the film really has nothing of interest to tell us -- no information of more than superficial value. The dialogue is a melange of cliches; the acting, with the exception of the British shiphands and captain (Bernard Hill gives a characteristically noble performance as the captain), is utterly saccharine and devoid of any credibility; and the plot is monotonous at best.<br /><br />Most of the praise of this movie stems, as far as what I can see, from the belief that millions of moviegoers can't be wrong. Even the Amazon editorial reviewer feels compelled to mention the film's box office success, which seems to me to be irrelevant to a critical evaluation. Of course, many of the film's detractors are saying that the premise of the movie -- a story of thwarted passion against the backdrop of one of history's greatest manmade catastrophes -- simply can't work. This has perhaps become a cliched critical position in itself, but I would at least argue that it is incredible that Cameron would have us believe that this is anything other than the lustful pairing of a bored hussy who has become disillusioned with upper-class society to an on-the-make street urchin who at first sight is beady-eyed for a woman who is beyond his social milieu, then driven forward by the thrill of adventure and the hunt. At best, though the underlying idea might be superficially appealing, the development of a profound love affair is implausible within the four-day time frame of Titanic's voyaging existence.<br /><br />The overarching problem that detracts from any ability to have a more workable plot is Cameron's meretricious focus on visuals. I have to confess myself being initially wowed by the special effects -- the rending of the ship and the plunging of the upper half into the Atlantic, the inner workings of the engine room, the underwater sequences. But in the end, it comes across as nothing other than sensationalism and the creation of cheap suspense through action. And it's all so far-fetched anyway, whether it's Rose's rescue of Jack from the ship's \\"dungeon\\" after being imprisoned for allegedly stealing the diamonds or Jack's last-minute unlocking of the gate for him and his \\"soulmate\\" to avert drowning. Such sequences as these offer the viewer a cheap thrill that is soon overcome by the question of why we should care a whit about Jack's and Rose's moral sham of a relationship when many other more worthy people around them are plummeting to their deaths.<br /><br />The movie's banality comes to a climactic point in the ending sequence in which Rose, now a centagenarian and the Titanic's sole remaining survivor, drops the jewel that her former fiance had given her. What was perhaps intended to be a culminating message of quiescence, as Rose lets go a memento from her past into the rippling vastness of the deep, ended up being to me an annoying reminder of the scene in which Rose and Jack first meet, at that same place, when Rose is about to melodramatically leap to her death (possibly one of the most overworked, shamelessly indulgent suicide attempts in movie history). \\"Why, oh why, couldn't they just slip their footing and rid us of their inane trifling repartee for ever?\\" I asked myself.<br /><br />Even if one excuses the obvious lack of reflection that went into making this movie, it all just simply goes on too long. Every moment you want it to end, it drags into another meaningless action scene, image, or piece of drivelly dialogue. Those who want to be encapsulated inside a cocoon filled with sickening sweetness for three hours may enjoy this. Me, I like to think when watching a movie.<br /><br />Grade: D+his. Me, I like to think when watching a movie.    Grade: D+
078322947X|5.0|If you are considering this film, no doubt you know that it is a remake (or hommage to) the classic French thriller Wages of Fear. Chances are everyone is also familiar with the outlines of the plot--a group desparate men agree to transport cargoes of unstable dynamite through 200 miles of South American jungle to put out an oilfield fire. Of course the drivers know they have voluneered for a suicidal job and the odds are against the survival of any of the truck drivers. That alone puts Sorcerer (along with Runaway Train & Sam Peckinpaw's The Wild Bunch) into the rarest category of films: the big-budget Hollywood existential! My view, a distinct minority view, is that William Friedkin's remake surpasses the orginal as an exercise in suspense and harrowing, relentless action. Like many other fans of this movie, my introduction came during the 1980s on cable movie channels. Few people saw Sorcerer on the big screen. The film was initally panned by critics and cited as a prime example of a young director with too much ego, power and money creating yet another Hollywood box-office disaster. Gradually, the film acquired an audience and a legacy through word of mouth. Today many critics see Sorcerer as the last great product of the seventies generation of young Hollywood film-makers. It is no accident that Sorcerer and Star Wars opened the same day!In many ways, the film marks the transition from the courageous experimental Hollywood of the seventies to the family blockbusters and action franchises of today.  Fans of Sorceror appreciate the director's  commitment to the story of desperate men risking everything to escape a very realistic, modern version of hell on earth. The opening backstory sequences show us how a small-time New Jersey criminal, a disgraced French banker, a Mexican assassin, and an Arab terrorist find themselves driving old trucks that can (and will) explode at any moment. The film has a hypnotic, dreamlike feel and the viewer will be drawn into a darkjourney that can only end one way. The score by the German band Tangerine Dream is at once seductive and chilling and contributes to the growing atmosphere of susense and dread. If you like stylish action and relentless story-telling, you should not miss this film. The DVD quality is OK but perhaps we might hope for a remastered director's cut with better special features at some point.

The song \\"How You Like Me Now.\\"<br />I loved the song so much I hit the internet to find out who it was and when I learned of tis CD I rushed to buy it.<br />I was not disappointed in the least!<br />Amazon's editorial for the cd says the band has \\"schizo music tastes\\" and I couldn't have put it better. There is a little bit of everything on this cd. There is surely something to please everyone, from the reggae beats of \\"Love Like That\\" to the hard rock undertones of \\"Stuck.\\"<br />If you are looking for a good time, give the Heavy's \\"The House That Dirt Built\\" a try, you will thank me for it later.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I was very curious to see if there was ever going to be a movie that would beat the record that Titanic has held for over ten years. The funny thing is I had a feeling that it would be another film from James Cameron. If there is one movie that had this nation a-buzz around the end of 2009 it was the imaginative grandeur of Avatar. This film had major critics to the average movie watcher going bonkers over almost everything it offered. Still, this movie fan has a great deal to say about this one.<br /><br />I have to give James Cameron some credit to his sci-fi epic. Giving us some of the greatest sci-fi action films in Aliens and Terminator, after Titanic it was only fitting for him to return to his fantasy roots. One of things that have been mentioned about Avatar was that it was an idea that Cameron had dating all the way back to 1995, that's even before Titanic was even released! You have to give a guy props when he says I have this great idea for a movie, but the technology has to catch up with the idea. Even dating back to 1999 we had seen George Lucas, The Wachoski Bros, Zack Snyder and Sam Raimi give some of the most visually stunning films of the decade. Yet, Cameron still felt his epic was not ready. Then suddenly the thought of brining movies back to the theaters in 3-D must have officially nailed it and James Cameron had started getting to work. It was a good idea to keep the public waiting for Avatar because the creatures and the landscapes were like Lord of the Rings on an acid trip. Everything was so original and so imaginative it was as if you walked into a dream. The action sequences were fluid and perfect; however there were a few flaws. While the technology of using digital characters has reached a climax, to the point where we are completely eliminating actors there is still a great deal of work to on using digital characters for slow, emotional segments in film. I feel that the animation was a little stiff and sometimes broken. I saw a much better performance from Andy Sirkis in Two Towers and I am sure a lot of people can agree. Yet I digress, Avatar came and it was graciously accepted in its entire imaginative wonderment. It was a movie that has been seen in all theaters 3-D and non and average fan has seen it in theaters at least 3 times! It went far beyond Titanic shattering every box office record and now with its DVD release it will no doubt shatter more records in the coming months. With that all said, it brings me to the real meat of this review. The only question I have had all this time after seeing it myself and seeing the overall reaction. Was Avatar really THAT good?<br /><br />I have been a fan of sci-fi fantasy films for many years, since my first Disney film at age 3. Ever since I saw Star Wars at age 9 this genre of film has been my utmost favorite. So Avatar for me was a movie I was actually NOT interested in seeing when I had first heard it was being released. Over time the hype was beginning to take me. Through many trailers and reading about the back story of how this movie came into existence I was sold. Just because to have put so much effort into getting this story to the big screen, it was something I had to witness. I walked out of the theater after about 3 hours amazed, but confused. No, I did not have the same reaction I did after seeing films like Spider-Man 3 or the DaVinci Code. That reaction being 3 hours of my life was stolen and I will never get them back. Still, even after seeing it almost 5 months ago I am wondering what all the fuss was about? I have to say that the special effects were mind blowing and as said earlier `like walking into a dream.' Well, the funny part is the blend of action and drama I felt was so uneven that the slow parts threw me into major dead spots. At one point I had actually fallen asleep! Yes, I stress that point...I FELL ASLEEP! I am not trying to bash this film in any way, but I wonder if Cameron actually took the time to revise his script? Unless I missed something entirely because I know I slept for less than ten minutes, there were just so many things missing in that movie. The character development was also extremely weak. I mean there was a decent amount of story linked to Jake Sully the main hero. Still, what about all the back story of the supporting cast? I mean there were just major dead points in the movie where Sully's Avatar was walking through the Pandora forest. We all knew who the enemies were in the movie, but why were they, and what made them such evil people. The main military officer had those 3 scars on his face, how did he get them? Was it an old phantom wound or something he received through his work on Pandora? What about the Navi in general, what is their story and why is James Cameron making a sequel and not a prequel? I feel that Cameron really focused more on the special effects and not enough on plot. Also the acting was dreadful! I almost gagged a few times with how pathetic some of the dialogue was. Apparently the AFI agrees with me because that movie while being nominated for a great deal of Oscars barley received any.<br /><br />  Still, what angered me the most about this movie was the message that was sent. It is one of those saw that before done that before deals. To replace American Indians or any group of people that has suffered in world history with digital blue people is a major insult in my eyes. To witness a take on true peoples plight for the purposes of just making billions to sell movie tickets is a true disgrace and always has been. Now, take a movie like Schindler's List, which I am sure many are going to bring up after reading this review. Yes, it is a story about the Holocaust, yes it was a movie that made Stephen Spielberg money, but the presentation on telling the story that in a dark time in history there was actually a good person who felt something had to be done is a true tribute and a gift. The movie while depressing was well acted and really gave us an incredible actor in Liam Neason. I feel however that there is another message in Avatar that is extremely overshadowed. It is the dangers of online gaming. In a world where technology overruns us and we are totally dependent, many of us use it as an escape from reality. In that moment we forget about the world we live in and how it runs. We lose sleep we don't eat properly and some people get so caught up in the game they don't even leave the house to socialize. Things like this cause people get so caught up in a false reality which can lead to serious mental and physical issues. Sometimes it can even lead to death. I do proudly play World of Warcraft, but one of the things I am happy to say is I can pull myself away from the game when I have to. I have a full time job a well maintained social life and maintain myself in current events. I give myself one day a week to just shut the world out so I can be alone with my thoughts and dedicate my time to my hobbies. Using online gaming in that manor can result in lowering stress levels and blood preassue and I have the medical records to prove it. In Avatar Jake would be so anxious to go back into his Avatar until the very end of the film where he actually became the Avatar! Is this to say it is ok to keep playing on YOUR Avatar because you live in a world of infinite lives and nothing can ever harm you? To that, I say shame on you. Yes, the real world is a bad place, but only you have the tools necessary to make it better and there are so many stories from celebrities to the average human being that were able to crawl from the destitute and find happiness. Probably one of the most heartwarming is the story of J.K. Rowling the author of Harry Potter. I won't go into any details, but if you Wiki her, her story will melt your heart.<br /><br />In summation, I do feel that Avatar is one of the movies you should see before you die, whether you love it or hate it, the ball will be in your court. In my opinion, like manyof James Cameron's other films I have seen I can only say this. I'm glad I saw it, but I will probably never see it again.in Liam Neason.

B001QOGYFO|5.0|I had not heard allot about this movie, but I am a big Kate Beckinsale fan so I bought the movie and I was not disapointed. It is a movie that will keep you in your seat. Its one of those movies you watch after dark when the wind is howling outside your window. If you like movies that have a strong woman lead, thriller, the who done it, you will enjoy this movie.

I wish they would've stuck a little bit more closely to the plot of Charlaine Harris' books because those are FABULOUS!  If you liked the idea of the Sookie Stackhouse books, you'll like the show.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|The first thing you notice is the guitar; a virtuoso take on the classic trebly Chuck Berry/Keith Richards axis, but with a difference. It abrades against your ear, it's a little too dissonant to be conventional, it feels like a succession of paper cuts, and it has fought for space and beaten out victorious everything else on the tape -- bass, drums, rhythm guitar are reduced to a dull clatter behind the six string eruption. The next thing you notice is the voice, screeching out the lines that provide the title of this review; mixed co-equal with the guitar, it too abrades against the ear, while on key it sounds like its about to shatter, the sound not of a braggart but a warrior too long out on point and about to bust in a million pieces. It's 1973, and welcome to the first few bars of that most aptly titled record Raw Power.    The Stooges story has been told far too many times to be recounted here; suffice to say that by the time of Raw Power they had already broken more barriers in three or four years than any of their contemporaries, fusing psychedelic garage rock, proto-metal,free jazz, and avant-garde performance art out of Artaud's theater of cruelty with an absolute lack of self consciousness, their artier conceits always rooted in the perspective of messed up suburban Detoit high school drop outs too young to buy the false promises of the '60's. To call them punk, which they invented, sells them way short.      By the time they recorded this album, the sheer psychic pressure of their epochal live performances coupled with the world's indifference had led the band to snap -- heroin and recrimination had broken them up. Enter superfan David Bowie, then on the cusp of his Ziggy-era fame, who performed for the Stooges the same act of noblesse oblige he demonstrated to Lou Reed and Mott the Hoople, resurrecting their careers and giving them a chance to record. Cleaned up and reconstituted with new guy/virtuouso guitarist James Williamson on board and sharing the writing burdens, the Stooges went into the studio with actual songs, in contrast to their previous method of jamming while Iggy did his thing until songs emerged out of the muck. But what worked for Lou and Mott did not work for the Stooges.     On the surface, Raw Power sounded like a conventional hard rock album of '73, not the avant garage of the band's previous work. But Iggy's voice is too terrifying to fit that mold -- and the lyrics all convey the impression of a man in a car with no brakes careening down Dead Man's Curve, they are all about impending death, and celebrating it. Most importantly, there's the sound of the album. Until 1997, when Iggy rebuilt the tracks for reissue from the ground up, the officical word was something went horribly wrong in the mix, with Bowie and Iggy each pointing fingers at the other. The rhythm tracks are way in the background, the vocals are alternately too far up front or too recessed, and Williamson's explosive leads bore a hole through the listener's eardrums, as they are so far up in the mix the album sounds like a free-jazz/metal guitar solo with the other elements darting in and out of the background. Humorously, because a generation of postpunk musicians grew up thinking this sound was not bad, but in fact extraordinary, post punk avant garage groups like Sonic Youth and Black Flag deliberately began to emulate the Raw Power mix in the '80's, and a whole lo-fi No Wave movement was born.    Bowie's effort at rehabbing the band was a fiasco -- the record, messed up mix and depraved vision sank like a stone, the band's performances degenerated into fabled brawls with hostile audiences, and the band, ironically clean at the time they made this hellhound-pursued record, sank back into addiction and dissolution, with Iggy eventually homeless and then insitutionalized, with several lost years passing till he rose like a phoenix to reclaim his crown, but now as a solo. Raw Power did the band in, and its very sound forecaststhe autodestruction. That's one thing that makes Raw Power special    Like I said, in '97 Ig re-mixed the record for the alt-rock generation, and the result was greeted with hossanahs. Crunching rhythm guitar riffs hitherto unhearable moved to the foreground with the bass and drums; Iggy's voice now had a tremendous presence, and many of his spontaneous grunts, cries, exhortations, vocalise, his famed shamanistic \\"composing at the mike,\\" was restored. The record now had the sonic ambience of a live band in a room rather than demons clattering in a wind tunnel in one of Hades' dicier neighborhood.  Most significantly, Williamson's lead guitar, the elephant in the room on the original album, was restored to parity with the other instruments. The only nay-sayers were the other Stooges, all of whom went on record as saying they detested what Iggy wrought with his tinkering. He made Raw Power into a normal-sounding punk rock record.    Now we can judge for ourselves who was right, Iggy or the Stooges. Sony Legacy has released the original 1973 \\"Bowie\\" mix. For years, I too thought the new version was a vast improvement, despite the fact I had grown up on my vinyl copy of the caterwauling original. But a couple of days of deep listening and comparison of the two version has restored the Bowie mix to preeminence. This is not, and never was, a normal record. This is an extreme record, a documentary snapshot of a band on a \\"death trip\\" (song title), sounding like they are on the ragged edge of nowhere.  Only the original version preserves that deviant, demented quality.  Accept no substitutes.    BTW, Sony has generously added a live show from '73 in Atlanta that adds little to the legacy, except for some prime audience-baiting from the Ig; the double-disc is at single disc price, however.

B002VECMAE|4.0|Distinguish between \\"movie reviewers\\" and \\"film critics.\\"  The former are incurably lazy creatures, driven by deadline and freebie lust.  The latter are insular and inclined to read into any film a \\"text.\\"  As someone in between the two poles, let me step up and say that the people who merely react to \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" react badly.  They reach for \\"Three Kings\\" references.  They want hunkiness.  They want plots.  They want easy lumps of comedy or satire or preaching or drama.    \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" is a great film.  It takes an absolutely unadaptable non-fiction work that is, itself, a meandering work of discovery journalism, and yet create a narrative out of it.  There are multiple threads in Jon Ronson's book, and the film makers chose one perspective, one emotional line, to frame their film.  The film is therefore closer to \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" than it is to \\"Three Kings,\\" because its story is the elegy of good intentions turned evil, diligent service perverted by personal sin or evil force.  The film celebrates a loss, a loss not of innocence, but a loss of reform.  Ronson's book does that, as well, but the film takes this element and reflects it in the narrator as well as the story the narrator is providing, and the figure the narrator follows.    The narrator (McGregor) has lost his innocence (a \\"normal life\\"), and that prepares him to see that there is a chance at redemption (the \\"big story\\"), and that gets corrupted (\\"they laugh at Barney the dinosaur\\"), and he emerges from the tale a harder, new man.  The story he chases is of Vietnam (the breaking of \\"normal war\\") and its hope for redemption (the \\"Be All that You Can Be\\" of the New Earth Battalion), and its destruction by the PsyOps \\"Dark Side\\" torture.  Interlaced stories of false redemption, where only the redeemer is left, and the redeemer must choose to fight on or accept the power of the Dark Side, play out.    The performances are superb, and the visuals are lovely.  The cinematography captures changes of era and setting subtly, even as costuming and caricature play for laughs.    If you see this \\"move\\" and \\"don't get it,\\" then that's alright.  Let it sit in your mind for a while.  Like the \\"quivering palm\\" it may take a few years to do its work, but it will devastate you, sooner or later.

B002KREVE2|5.0|Me and... Leonard Cohen at Isle of Wight 1970 and 2009, 21 Oct 2009   By  Peter Solomon           Memories, Dreams and Reflections - Isle Wight 1970.     Me and... Leonard Cohen at Isle of Wight 1970 and 2009     By Peter Solomon 1970 and 2009       I was just two months shy of my seventeenth birthday at 4 am on August 31 1970 and I knew all the words, I was maybe 50 to 75 yards from the stage just outside the overrun VIP and Press enclosure and Leonard Cohen was about to appear on stage at the Isle of Wight Festival.     My older brother Chris was to blame for me being there, for he introduced me to Leonard Cohen, and I had become smitten, I had caught the Leonard Cohen bug big time, which I would be unable to shake off for the rest of my life.     I knew all the songs and all about Marianne, Suzanne and Nancy. And I knew Tonight Will Be Fine, for I had waited 5 days and nights with hardly any sleep, after hitch hiking 250 miles with a friend Johnny Vernon from Manchester in the north of England to be there. I had just slept through most of Jimi Hendrix's set, though disappointed to have missed him, that was unimportant as I had come to see Leonard Cohen, and was slowing moving forward to get as close as possible to the stage.     Looking back now after nearly 40 years it seems like a dream and I have woken up and am watching the DVD of my Dream, compulsively, 3 consecutive times so far and also listened to the whole CD. It's as if time had become dislocated and the warp and woof of reality expanded to include a 40 year Present Moment.     As I watch I am really identifying very intensely with almost spiritual longing with that young man at the beginning of the DVD who was about my age, it was like coming to Bethlehem to see baby Jesus he says, except Leonard Cohen is no 'baby Jesus', and it also felt as much like Babylon as Bethlehem, with Fires, Chaos and Free Love all on display. But it was still like a holy pilgrimage for me.     I wanted so much to connect the2 time-streams, as I watched Leonard on the DVD, the present with the past, to be there again, with my 17 year old self who was waving matches in the night, through the cold mists of time, trying to signal his presence to his future self. The strangeness of being a mere part, a cell in the huge Beast of Babylon that was the crowd, a Body of 600,000 people. You Know Who I Am, You've Stared at the Sun, sang the poet and prophet in the middle of the night and we stared at the stage where there was a human star burning with such bright intensity, as we stood in awe in the vast dark, small points of light, our matches in our hands.     The 1970 Leonard Cohen never looked so prickly and real, so unshaven, so raw and human yet so sensitive and spiritual, so powerful and yet so frail. So spaced out yet so centred in the moment. Speaking and singing from the heart with words and songs that communicate with the souls of men. He looked like some suffering Christ like figure that came to tell the world the truth but had just been woken up and did not really want to bother.     This was the biggest rock festival in the history of the world and there has not been anything like it since. I was there to see Leonard Cohen in 1970 at the Isle of Wight and feel after viewing the DVD in 2009 that events like these go beyond their stated purpose and moment, reverberate through time and become cracks in the fabric of the world and as Leonard would say, `that's how the light get's in', we enter a Communion with the Higher Powers. \\"We pray for the angels and then the angels pray for us\\" to misquote LC. The negative forces on Devastation Hill become insignificant, they had played their part to pump up the intensity and now are just another part of the story, another part of the myth... of how the artist calms the savage beast and opens a spiritual channel for transcendent love to flow and manifest in the world.     Leonard Cohen's words and songs are mined from the very deepest heart and soul. They are like the golden thread from some magical loom, which weave their way through time and remain with us from moment to moment, as we grow older they make our lives richer, more meaningful and bearable.     I am so pleased to have had this chance to be transported back 40 years in time and relive my younger days again. It`s been an experience full of unique and extraordinary memories and emotions. And thanks to Leonard Cohen for being a beacon of light in the darkness of the world, truly he transcends past and present, to bring us the timeless truth of the heart.     If you want to know what it was like to be at one of the defining moments in musical history...buy this DVD/CD.

B001HN694K|2.0|Watching Alice, you'd never think you were watching a Tim Burton film. Burton is a creative director with an eye for whimsy and colorful as well as strange and macabre-but you feel none of that when watching Alice in Woderland. Yes it is vivid and full of color and wonky shaped objects fill every screen-but it never really resonates with you. There is no mystery or 'wow' factor. It's sort of pretty to look at, but that's all it is.     The actual story is a tad confusing as well as you're not really sure if you are watching a sequel to anything or a retelling. It just feels sort of hasty and rushed in certain parts. There is no flow or direction and then your at the end of the film and it all just feels...strange. And speaking of strange, I just found the ending (after she leaves Wonderland) really weird and pointless, unless I missed something entirely while watching the very beginning.     In regards to characters and acting, Helena Bonham Carter is the star of this production, by far. She's crazy, delusional and utterly perfect in this role. Even hearing \\"off with their head!\\" didn't get stale after so long. Johhny Depp as the Mad Hatter was a dissapointment. He's supposed to be loony, but there are times when you think he knows exactly what he's doing. His accent is distracting and overall, I just wasn't feeling the performance. Anne Hathaway has a short but cute part as the White Queen, the evil Queen of Heart's sister. It's slightly over the top but works for her. As for the Alice herself, played by Mia Wasikowska, well to be honest, I barely remember her. She was very passive and bland throughout the entire film and didn't really emote , well, anything. I can't review this film properly without including Mr. Alan Rickman...He plays Caterpillar, of course, and though his role is very small, it is also quite enjoyable. It's amazing what that man does with his voice. He flawlessy goes from berating to indifferent to sarcastic all in the span of a sentence. Justbrilliant.    All in all I was dissapointed. What should have been a slam dunk for Burton turned out to be a bore-fest. All the ingredients are there-but he just didn't cook up a good one this time around...
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdrop--they seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting.<br /><br />  The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent.<br /><br />  The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop).<br /><br />  After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative).<br /><br />  The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker.<br /><br />  We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the ones who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face'.<br /><br />  The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouseon top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!).<br /><br />  The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.<br /><br />  Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.<br /><br />  Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum--that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.on top of a giant pile of cash.

Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.<br /><br />  Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.<br /><br />  Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum--that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.
0891419195|5.0|One of the best books about WW II I have ever read. The author takes us right into the bloody mess of Marines at their best during the war in the Pacific. Most books about war paint a rosie picture of combat. With the Old Breed you ar there on the ground in the middle of the horror of war. I salute all Marines for their service and duty to country. From one proud Marine to all his comrades in arms. Gung Ho, Sempre Fi

B0039UTDA6|5.0|We've been DVRing \\"Life\\" and my 6, 7 & 13 year old kids ask to watch it every moment they can. They've seen many of the episodes multiple times and are still interested. They love it so much that we've decided to buy it and give it as b-day gifts to some of their friends.      I think it's wonderfully done and enjoy watching it, too.  It has beautiful images/screens of animals, some of which I've never seen before.  So, so cool to see the miracle of God's creations! This would be ideal for home-schoolers!!
0307454541|4.0|Wow, this book was pretty rough in parts, but if you can get past those parts it is also a really good read. There was a lot of groundwork to be laid out for this story before you start to get into the \\"can't put it down\\" phase. The story deals with a large family corporation so describing each family member's character and their dynamic within the family took some time. I read it on my Kindle and would say around 38% the story really kicked off and I could hardly stop reading.<br /><br />I did have a difficult time getting through a couple of the rough parts involving sadism, rape, etc. (mainly because I wasn't expecting them) but apart from those extremely descriptive parts the overall storyline itself was intriguing.<br /><br />I am looking forward to seeing the movie (apparently it came out March 19, 2010) and also starting on the sequel to this book called The Girl Who Played With Fire
B001TDPPVG|5.0|Aurora is an album by Israeli bassist Avishai Cohen, whose recordings blend his instrumental talent with his powerful voice singing in Hebrew and Ladino (the Spanish-based language of the Sephardic Jewish tradition). Though Aurora is jazz at its heart, it reaches out to other musical genres and traditions. The result is an uplifting, visionary fusion worthy of the highest recommendation for music lovers intrigued by new experiences. Aurora is an enhanced CD; it also contains interviews, photos, and video of Avishai, accessible by inserting the CD in one's computer. The tracks are \\"Morenika\\" (4:33), \\"Interlude in C# Minor\\" (0:59), \\"El Hatzipor\\" (6:04), \\"Leolam\\" (3:30), \\"Winter Song\\" (4:59), \\"It's Been So Long\\" (5:17), \\"Alon Basela\\" (4:05), \\"Still\\" (3:35), \\"Shir Preda\\" (4:02), \\"Aurora\\" (4:23), \\"Alfonsina y el Mar\\" (4:29), \\"Noches Noches / La Luz\\" (7:20).
0393072231|5.0|This is an excellent book,although difficult to understand at times because of the complexity of the investment vehicles,it is still worth reading for every citizen,young or old.It is presented in an interesting story-line that keeps the reader intrigued and anxious to read what's next. I was preparing a letter to several Congressman to urge them to read this,but I see Goldman Sachs is being charged with fraud so the message of this book has been received by our leaders.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I love the Dualshock 3 controller. I own 3 regular 6 Axis controllers which look very similar to the Dualshock 3 controller and I know as soon as I pick one of the regular ones up that its not the right controller because it feels cheap.<br /><br />The Dualshock controller is solid and has a little more weight to it. I think its worth the money and it adds to the experience of a game. When I play with a regular controller I don't feel as immersed in the game.<br /><br />And the battery life in this thing last forever. I rarely feel I ever have to charge it, and when I do it last long.<br /><br />I recommend getting a DualShock 3 controller, especially if you play a lot of action games with a lot of explosions.  =)
0743297334|4.0|This is a timeless book about how pettiness and jealousy and alcohol and loose lips can ruin relationships. It's also a look at how people try to drink to numb the pain that life provides. Jake, Robert, Brett and the others in this book are the arty, literary type who go to Paris to watch the bullfighting and the running of the bulls, but are soon torn apart by factions, fighting,  and pettiness.    The book is set in 1926 Spain and France, but it speaks of issues that transcend time and culture. It's not a great story, but it captures in a classic way a timeless problem.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've always had a hard time with the number keys on my keyboard, so in WoW I always clicked spells, etc., instead of pounding buttons. I bought this little number and damn, my game improved instantly.  Three customizable profiles (one for my Pally, one for my Hunter, and one for RP). I use the joystick to run, so the mouse is free to look at any time, all actions are instant.  It's great - stop reading reviews and buy it!

B00284BNKC|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen in years (and I have 547 movies)!!!  This movie might be good if you are high on drugs, but otherwise, avoid it like the plague.  I'm really surprised that it got such good reviews...I actually bought it based on the reviews but this time, I think the reviews are wrong.  This movie tries to use symbolism and random camera moves so much that it's laughable.  It basically is the sort of movie images that is for the idiots.  If you want a movie that will stimulate your mind...avoid this movie.  You would be better spending 2 hours watching Sponge Bob Square Pants.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Worth the cost just for 'Crying Blue Rain;' The different versions of 'Hear My Train Comin' and Red House also very good even for those who have much or all of Jimi's music already.  I have a pretty big collection of his work but didn't have 'Crying Blue Rain.' Of course, get the CD for better sound; those MP3 and other online digital tunes just don't have as much sound data.
B002RAREAK|3.0|Usher is a great singer and performing/recording artist, and with this album's singles, I really expected better. I really got into \\"Papers,\\" \\"Hey Daddy,\\" \\"Little Freak,\\" and \\"There Goes My Baby\\" (which should have been a much bigger hit). Then I heard \\"OMG,\\" and thought, \\"oookay.. typical will.I.am bullsh**.\\" I bought it anyway based on the other songs. This is a mixed bag of an album. \\"Monstar\\" was... odd lol. I didn't quite know what to make of it, but I liked it at times. I don't like most of the up-tempo and electronic joints very much (OMG, She Don't Know, Okay), and I thought So Many Girls and Pro Lover were kinda juvenile for Usher, especially after Here I Stand. I liked Foolin Around and Guilty and Making Love Into the Night though, definitely. So for me, the album was half and half. It's not bad, but it's not really good. Out of all the dance, electronic stuff, WHY was \\"More\\" left off the album??? Of all the songs to cut, jeez.. Anyway, I still think the best R&B album I've heard recently is Trey Songz Ready. I thought this album was going to be some kind of cross between Confessions and Here I Stand and progressing from there. I don't know. If you're really an Usher fan, it's worth copping, but it's definitely not his strongest effort.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|There is one recent movie about the Victorian era which is accurate, by and large, \\"Young Victoria\\". Far from being merely a love story, it opens with the dying king William IV (played by Jim Broadbent) and underage Victoria (Emily Blunt) . If the king dies before Victoria, next in line to the British crown, reaches eighteen, her guardian mother the Duchess of Kent or her mothers nasty boyfriend John Conroy (the same actor who played the villain in Sherlock Holmes, Mark Strong) become Regent, the ruler, in her stead. They have severely restricted her activities, her dress and her acquaintances to \\"protect her\\" or to keep her naive. Her only allowed companion was her dog \\"Dash\\". The King hated these two or the idea of regency. He keeps himself alive by an act of Will till Victoria turns eighteen. She becomes Queen as one of her first official acts banishes her mother and scheming boyfriend.<br /><br />Suddenly at eighteen she becomes ruler of the richest nation in the world. Who can she trust to advise her? She is young and naive. On every hand are people who want to manipulate her to their own ends in England and rulers of other countries scheming to marry her and control Britain. She places her faith in Lord Melbourne, who selflessly advises her on statecraft while he is in power. But then he isn't. Victoria needs help, but who. She meets her distant cousin Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (part of today's Germany). Albert's king father Leopold I of Belgium wants him to marry her so he can control England. But Albert meets her and, well, eventually falls in love. But more than that wants to protect her. There is an on and off courtship for years, Victoria and the British people are very suspicious of foreigners and foreign influence. Victoria has become rather egotistic and sometimes pig-headed at this point. Victoria goes from being naive, thrust into a position far above her experience, overwhelmed to being overconfident, foolhardy and obstinate... and then problems happen in England, based on her decisions...Albert advises her obliquely on issues of state, saves her life and gradually she comes to trust him.<br /><br />This is the real feminist movie, not the formulaic Alice in Wonderland Hollywood distortion. Victoria went on to be the longest serving monarch - the three longest serving British monarchs were all women, Victoria, Elizabeth II and Elizabeth I. This movie is a fascinating view into the time and the British government and monarchy. No car chases, all drama. My only minor quibble is that Victoria was not as pretty and shorter than Emily Blunt who does a great job otherwise of portraying her as does Rupert Friend portraying Albert.  If you are tired of Hollywood trash, this is a movie with acting and substance. After two recent Hollywood fantasy movies which are severe distortions of the Victorian era, mistreatments, way off the mark, unbelievable (\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" & \\"Sherlock Holmes\\"), this is real. Should have been nominated for several Academy Awards, acting cinematography, costumes, best picture.... and then problems happen in England, based on her decisions...Albert advises her obliquely on issues of state, saves her life and gradually she comes to trust him.

B000002JSN|5.0|Not much more to add because everything's pretty much been said already. This collection of songs goes beyond standard rock fare. Here, Zepplin isn't just making rock and roll, they're making MUSIC; very good music that hits you with the intensity of a swift kick in the chops.     Yes, this is a fine rock album, complete with enough blues riffs to make guitarist Jimmy Page sound like he hails from the Mississippi Delta. Drummer John Bonham's rhythms could register on the Richter scale and bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones draws from an incredible pallette offering the most sublime color and texture - he has always been the band's secret weapon. Robert Plant's vocals shine throughout the album.     \\"Kashmir\\" is the crowning achievement here, and \\"The Wonton Song\\" has a delicious funk to it. Both \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and \\"Custard Pie\\" have their own terrific grooves. \\"Physical Graffiti\\" is essential for any music library as well as for any budding Zep fan.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I have listened to this CD more than I've listened to any of Whitney's other CDS. Every song on this CD is good. She and Clive really picked out some nice ones. While her voice does not sound the same, she can STILL sing. So if you were expecting her to sound exactly the same as she did 20 years ago, you may be disappointed.    But I wasn't disappointed. I don't care if Whitney sounds like she has razor blades in her throat, the fact that she is singing anything at all is amazing to me. To even attempt a comeback, after all she's been through, had to take a lot of courage so I am very proud of her.     Now I'm no sugar-coater. If the CD sounded bad, I would say that but it doesn't. This is a really nice CD. You can start from track 1 and let 'er rip. It's been a long time since I've bought a CD and liked all of the songs (the CD may have 2 songs on it I like, then the rest of it is garbage). All she's doing is singing in a key that is comfortable for her and I don't see what's so wrong with that. Like I said, she can still sing, she just sings differently.     And for those who have a problem embracing Whitney's new singing style, they obviously weren't fans in the first place, so she hasn't lost much. A true fan is supportive no matter what. At this time in her life, she doesn't need criticism. She needs the love and support of her true fans, like me. Love You Whitney!
B00275EGWY|4.0|The Hurt Locker is a very well executed film about an aspect of the war in Iraq we don't think of often: the experiences of the troops assigned to deactivate bombs so that they cannot ever cause damage. The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen; and along with that hand-held camera style of photography I genuinely felt as if I were watching a documentary about real people instead of a film with Hollywood actors in it. In addition, the choreography works wonders for the film; the script was well written and the casting was superbly done.<br /><br />It isn't long before we meet three soldiers who take on the task of deactivating bombs: Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), who gets a drug-like thrill from being the one to go in and deactivate bombs even when he doesn't have to and his two backup men Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and the somewhat troubled Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) who talks to the company shrink but doesn't ever get comfortable with the war the way William James does.<br /><br />I could say so much about this movie, including what James' \\"hurt locker\\" represents but then I would be giving too much away. Suffice it to say that the movie is essentially a series of sequences that show the difficulties and the life-or-death stakes the troops face as portrayed by the characters James, Sanborn and Eldridge. There's plenty of action, tension and thriller aspects that add to the overall quality of the film; and the cameos we get from greats like Ralph Fiennes are wonderful. Look also for well done cameos by Evangeline Lilly as Connie James and Guy Pearce as Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. Christopher Sayegh does an excellent job of playing the role of Beckham, a young boy who gets caught up with William James as the film progresses.<br /><br />If the film has any flaw, I would say that they could have edited down just a bit of the war footage and added just a few minutes more to the scenes in which Williams James is a civilian.<br /><br />In addition, the DVD comes with a \\"behind the scenes\\" featurette and an optional running commentary.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker will forever be one of the great movies about the modern day war in Iraq. I highly recommend this film for people interested in this subject; and people who enjoy thrillers, action movies and even dramas would do well to add this to their collections.ddition, the DVD comes with a \\"behind the scenes\\" featurette and an optional running commentary.

0066620996|5.0|This is a must read for anyone starting or growing a business or even nonprofit.  In very easy to read language, Collins distills the half dozen traits that a few select companies share.  What makes the book work in terms of its lessons being convincing is the empirical approach that Collins took.  He didn't just choose one trait from company A and another from company B.  He used an objective system to find eleven companies that by objective standards have outperformed their industries and the market as a whole and then found their common themes.
B001THZAAI|4.0|I heard about this movie on NPR and how it was a blockbuster in France. Could not wait to get my hands on it, but when I did, it was not exactly what I expected. I don't speak French and I'm sure that if I spoke the language it would have been a lot funnier. Good movie though. I would give it a 7 on a scale from 1-10.
0143038419|5.0|I think as reviewers on Amazon, we hope to persuade potential buyers on whether or not to purchase a product.  As with any product or service, this book has its own defined demographic. Those outside the demographic will not relate to it as much. So if you are a centered, 100% confident woman with solid, loving relationships, and know exactly what your purpose in life is, I can understand why you wouldn't appreciate this book.  For the rest of us though, I thought this book offered priceless nuggets of wisdom throughout it.  And while it's not a self-help book, the writer's journey teaches us about self-forgiveness and the quest for spirituality.      This book should be viewed as a journal, as it is written as such.  Journal writing is typically very self-centric, hence, the \\"self-absorbed\\" perception of the writer that many reviewers have of this book.  I personally found her prose to be witty and genuine.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the culture and customs of Italy, India, and Indonesia. even if it wasn't all-inclusive.  I related to the concept of being aware of your faults and habits, but struggling to break them (I have my own \\"David,\\" who as the writer puts it, IS \\"both my catnip and kryptonite\\").  Yes, I questioned the writer's mindset on numerous occasions, but I realize that everyone is NOT like me, and is entitled to their own feelings, emotions, and opinions.  So we don't share some of her behavioral tendencies. Does that mean we just write her off as a person?    This book is not a quick read. The writer does get hung up in the India part of the book. But I'm glad that I persevered.  What I gleaned from this book is that: 1) you don't need to succumb to the pressures that society bestows upon us; 2) happiness is truly found from within yourself; and 3) I'm open to the differences and similarities between spirituality and religion. It doesn't always have to be an either/or proposition.
0061537969|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Enzo, the dog, is the narrator of this story.  If you have ever been a pet owner or a fan of dogs you will enjoy the thoughtful insight this author has created in Enzo.  The book lagged for me at times but the pay off was truly the end.  Enzo is the friend all of us wish for in a lifetime whether animal or human.  His love and devotion to his family is just one that can be believed, trusted and even envied by the readers.  The end was beautiful and like so many really good reads, answers the questions/brings Enzo's thoughts on life full circle.  I highly recommend.  This story although can be sad,is not as gut wrenching as Marley and Me. I felt this story was so much more powerful and emotional by the way this author left his readers settled and loved just like Enzo and Denny and Zoe at the end.  Enjoy, it is truly a good read!

B002VECM6S|5.0|The movie,\\"Blind Side\\", was well written.  Showing an aspect of children/teens often neglected---their own identity crisis.  For whatever reason, a lost identity is a real loss---similar to death---in its emotional impact on the person's whole life.  And, when it's a child/teen, it's a tragedy.  MUST SEE with open eyes---maybe several times---to feel the impact of one of Life's Blind Sides.
B000004CYT|4.0|This was one of the first complete cycles of the Beethoven symphonies on period instruments, and is an important recording, if not the top choice among many competing versions.<br /><br />In general the Academy of Ancient Music plays with spirit and drive, if not always with complete precision (there are some intermittent tuning problems). But perhaps these were inherent problems of playing old music on old instruments, and the AAM and Hogwood are to be commended for pioneering this genre of classical recording.<br /><br />Sound quality is generally good (the recordings are from 1982-1988), however John Eliot Gardiner's set of the symphonies offers superior sound and much better technical execution, and is the probable first choice for those wishing to own a period-instrument cycle of the Beethoven symphonies.

B00006ZXSK|4.0|The Cinderella story lends itself to luscious filming--the beautiful setting of medieval France, the gorgeous gowns, the palace--this version of Cinderella takes full advantage of the setting and portrays it realistically (for a fairy tale) yet also with a glow that makes me want to go there!  Few movies of fairy tales manage the balance between historical context and magical setting as well as this one.  There are some historical inaccuracies as pointed out in other reviews, but I didn't mind because the storyline is so clever.      The dialogue delights--it's witty, reveals character, and conveys the period well.  Ditto on the characters--all the actors fit their roles so well that I can't imagine anyone else besides Drew Barrymore playing Danielle or Angelica Huston playing the stepmother.  These characters possess a surprising amount of depth for the simple archetypes they are in the fairy tale, which I attribute to great script-writing and talented acting.    So why 4 stars?  Another reviewer mentioned that she had a problem with Dougary Scott but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.  I had a similar issue, not with Dougary Scott himself and his portrayal of the prince, which I thought remarkably well-done--on the cusp of boyhood and manhood, he is at times spoilt, thoughtful, adventurous, duty-bound, funny, intellectually curious, or sometimes all of these at once, which made for a very interesting character.  However, the storyline did not allow him to grow as Danielle grows, and that bothered me, since they're destined to be a great romantic couple.  I appreciated Danielle's strength of character, but I wanted the prince to show the same strength of character to be worthy of her, and that didn't quite happen.  The seeds are in the storyline--he overcomes his father's wishes and his own problems with love versus duty--but these seeds never quite come to fruition for me.    Otherwise, great film--I've seen it more times than I can say, and it delights every time.
0393072231|5.0|Absolutely great book by a gifted author - Michael Lewis.  Comes at the financial meltdown in subprime financing thru the odd characters who saw the end coming and bet on it.  Reads like a Gresham novel.    Amazon had it to me within two days!  Great job.    Will Lofft
B000SMWUPS|1.0|I have a Chicco Capri umbrella stroller and wanted a basic cup holder for it. After one use, it was clear that this product is not intended for a stroller that folds up for storage. When the stroller was folded, the cup holder also folded in half which broke the wire that gives the cup holder some structure. The sharp wire poked out of the canvas and presented a dangerous scratching or poking hazard. If you were to take the cup holder off the stroller every time, this would probably not have happened, but I wanted a cup holder that I could just leave on the stroller. I have a hard time believing I am the first person that this has happened to...who wants to remove the cup holder every time you put the stroller back in the car?    I had my husband trim off the excess wire to make the cup holder more \\"fold-able\\", still trying to make it work out (I really wanted this cup holder!). The very next use, the velcro straps that attach the cup holder to the stroller ripped off, making the whole thing worthless. A complete waste of money for a poorly designed and cheaply made product.     Still searching for that cup holder!
B000069HZP|3.0|\\"The Game\\" starts out slow showing Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a bored, lonely investment banker who has or was given everything.  His younger brother Conner or Conrad (Sean Penn) asks him to meet for lunch on his birthday and hands Nicholas a birthday card with an unusual gift inside.  It is a gift card to enroll Nicholas in Consumer Recreation Services (CRS), a company that creates amazing real-life games for each participant.  Nicholas reluctantly goes as he promised his brother he would.  A series of psychological and unique tests are conducted to see how he would react in stressful situations.<br /><br />The game begins and Nicholas quickly realizes that he has become a victim of dangerous life threatening pranks.  As the game progresses to higher stakes, he loses his money and becomes paranoid, he trusts no one.  The thought that the game is a set-up to strip him of his millions and leave him dead scares him to the brink.  He has flashbacks of his father's suicide and after a traumatic final game \\"play\\" he gives up all hope.  As they say, it is darkest before the dawn and the ending is quite a surprise.<br /><br />Overall \\"The Game\\" it keeps your interest but the hair-raising escapes are improbable.
B00005JPSM|5.0|This is a great movie if you like chefs, food and romance. When you put all three together you get one great movie!
0553583182|5.0|Before reading this book, I watched the movie clip \\"The secret\\" but who knew you had to pay a whole lot more money to find out how to practice the \\"secret\\" by buying more books, or taking a $500 seminar or course from one of \\"the secret\\" promoters on the clip. I couldnt afford it so I just tried doing the treasure map thing, but still...nothing. Then I read this book by Dr. Joseph Murphy. I read it several times since getting this book and DR. JOSEPH MURPHY tells you what \\"The secret\\" charges you to tell you. I know a lot of people assume its all about positive thinking ect... but its more than that. Yeah, you shouldnt think negatively, and you shouldnt dwell on the bad things in your life. Dr. Joseph Murphy tells you to dwell only on what you WANT not what you DONT want. His \\"secret\\" is getting into a \\"sleepy state\\" right before bedtime (which is just getting into Alpha level brainwave like Jose Silva teaches) and visualizing vividly as possible of what you want for 10-15 minutes before falling asleep. Also to do this as soon as you wake up in the morning again for 10-15 minutes. Well he doesnt exactly tell you for how long, but he does tell you when to do it. Visualize in the NOW in the PRESENT, where you can feel all five senses. Smell, taste, touch, hear, see...For example, you want a specific type of job...visualize feeling your hand shaking with your new boss, seeing and hearing him tell you in front of you that you got the job. Hear and see him talking to you. The key thing is to visualize in the first person, not the third person. The Third person means (if you dont know) to watch yourself shaking your new boss hand like you were watching a home video of yourself, like an observer or something. The first person would be you the ACTOR in that movie, not the Audience of that mental movie.<br /><br />Anyway, sorry for the long review but if you need more details on how to visualize, get the book\\"creative visualization\\" by Shakti Gawain, she tells you step by step on how to Visualize, and manifest your desires. Her book is more in depth, while Dr. Joseph Murphy tells you why it works, how it works, how others have used it and succeeded and sample affirmations. I suggest reading this book first, then reading \\"Creative Visualization\\" by Shakti Gawain after.  Then once you are done with these two, the book you must read is \\"The nature of personal reality\\" a seth book by Jane Roberts. This will answer questions about the Law of Attraction that Dr. Joseph Murphy and Shakti Gawain doesnt answer that you will have about the subject pertaining to everything else in life and a lot more. These three books will change your mind forever.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|If your looking for a nice pair of gaming headphones that offer digital surround sound look no further than the Turtle Beach X41s. I've owned these since late January and must say they are simply fantastic. The sound is great and voice chat over Xbox Live is so much better with the headphones than with the standard mic set that comes with a new system. The only draw backs I can think of are that sometimes when I'm playing a single player game and a friend wants to get in a party chat the mic won't work when I have it unplugged and hook up. Another bad thing is this really eats through batteries. I bought a set of four recharageable AAAs and sometimes I can get a decent amount of time out of them and other times they die after one sitting. I finally resorted to buying an 8 pack of Energizer Advanced Lithium which gives me about 40 hours of play time. Going to go back to the rechargeables after my last set dies and see if there's an improvement. Also on another positive note you can use the headphones with a PS3 however the chat feature doesn't work. Well you can use the headphones with anything with an optical output or a Red/White composite output. So if your in the market for a high quality sound system for late night gaming or movie watching and don't want a surround sound system then defiently give these a go because you won't be dissapointed.    Hopefully the X41's successor will offer chat across all platforms like a few of the rival products do.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I must admit that I also play a lot of fantasy RPG videogames, having said that the show starts a little bit slow in the first episodes but after that it becomes addictive just like an RPG game. Between the seeker learning his true powers and the lore surrounding this magical land without being cheesy or pushy towards it like most other fantasy shows. The writers and the cast found a nice balance and I really enjoy this tv show.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Earlier this year, I used Wikipedia to see what NM is up to and saw she was releasing &#34;Leave Your Sleep&#34;. On YouTube she performs and explains the project (SEARCH Natalie Merchant BBC 2010). She explains the project. She has the talent to release anything. She can rock, sing country, Blue Grass and more. So I knew this was not a rock project. I don't say what it is because she describes the project so clear you should hear it from her.  I don't follow artists. So I thought it was interesting how many people on YouTube, like myself, knew so little about an artist we like so much. I learned how versatile she is. Already knew she is talented.  UPDATE I saw her in DC last night for the first time. If you research on YouTube this CD, you will make the decision to buy or not then. If you do that and elect to buy you will be happy. I view this as a new form of music, very intellectual. She is amazing and the small venue is perfect for this project.

1402217722|4.0|Horatia Winwood is the youngest of three sisters, and when the Earl of Rule offers for her eldest sister the whole family is upset. The eldest daughter is in love with another, the middle daughter refuses to marry anyone and with an elder brother that loves to gamble has the family in desperate financial straights and so the daughters can't afford to refuse the match. Horatia steps up and throws herself at the Earl and demands that if he wants so much to marry a Winwood that he should marry her instead. So he does. What follows is a story of at times hilarious and at times exasperating hi-jinks with the seventeen year old taking Society by storm and going from one scrape to the next. When an enemy of the Earl steps up and attempts to stir the pot and ruin his new young bride in the eyes of Society things take a dangerous turn and sword fights, high way robbery and a great deal of intrigue ensues.<br /><br />While being just as well researched, well written and interesting in its own way as other Heyer works, the book The Convenient Marriage had a heroine that I did not like nearly as well this time. Horatia was stubborn, obstinate, mulish and very naive. I had a hard time learning to like the character and only started to enjoy her towards the end as she started to finally realize the horrible mess she was making of things. I honestly could not see what the Earl got out of the match at all, unless it was simply that he wanted a child-woman for a bride that he would look after, mess with, and run circles around all the time.<br /><br />That being said, the novel was absolutely hilarious. The situations were amusing and comically well written, the dialogue was witty in sometimes sly and sometimes exasperating ways, and Horatia's family (not to mention Horatia herself) provided excellent comic relief to some at times very tense situations. I also loved the depictions of the Macaronis, just picturing the clothes, powdered wigs, make-up and mincing stride (not to mention the girly attitude) of these 18th century metrosexuals often got a chuckle out of me throughout the book.<br /><br />Even though the heroine was at times very frustrating to read about, the plot kept me engaged to the last page turn with all of the sword fights, the various back stabbing characters, and the intrigue of London's Ton. Though by the end it was pretty easy to guess how it all was going to end, and I just found it (yet again) frustrating that the characters didn't even guess what was about to happen next, it was that obvious. So, though well written and engaging, it had to lose a star for a frustrating heroine that took away a lot more than she added to the book. I just wish she had been written in a slightly different way, though I guess for her to grow and change as much as I wanted her to, there would have had to have been a much longer book!ude) of these 18th century metrosexuals often got a chuckle out of me throughout the book.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|After mourning the irretrievable loss of of Layne Staley and the perceived loss of Alice in Chains, this disc celebrates the reincarnation of AIC and is - surprisingly - a fitting epitaph and celebration of Layne Staley's influence in the heavy music world. For all that I had wished that Boggy Depot was going to be the brilliant offspring of Alice, it just didn't fill my gut with the sparkling dark energy that AIC always did. I had resolved myself to taking a walk with \\"the 3 legged dog\\" when I needed a bracing hit of quality sonic soul shaking, and while that last brilliant stroke of the Staley/Cantrell brush still stands in my ears as the quintessential dance with Alice, \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is a fresh ticket to the future of one of my favorite bands ever. May this second coming stretch into a future of aural delight worthy of the good name of Alice in Chains.     Dr. Odd
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Time and time again, Natalie Merchant always deliver the kind of music that stimulate your inner senses and warms the soul. Although not her lyrics this time, but poems by famous and obscure poets of 19th and 20th century, her interpretation and composition of each poem thru music is an absolute genius from the upbeat Calico Pie to a heart wrenching  Spring and Fall: to a young child. Her collaborations with over 100 musicians creating different genre of music in one album, validates her artistic ability to create music that impact one's life regardless of what culture and beliefs you have. Thank You Miss Merchant for this wonderful gift to your fans and to other people who appreciates music as an instrument in changing lives.
0393072231|5.0|I'm working toward my Accounting Degree and studying to be a financial regulator, but I promise you don't need to have these interests to find this book fascinating. It is written in language that anyone could understand - and the asides by Michael Lewis will keep you in stitches throughout the book. Anyone who was affected by the financial crisis in the past few years, whether it was your 401-K or other investments or merely the value in your home, should read this book. The more people understand what the leaches on Wall Street did to our country, the better off we will all be. I am looking forward to going back to read Lewis's other book regarding this subject matter that was written in the 90s, \\"Liar's Poker\\". Hopefully this book continues to get the noteriety that his previous work lacked and we can learn something this time.

B0037W68F4|4.0|The album art doesn't quite work. I'll say that. It makes the record seem like a compilation from the Go! Team. It belies the strengths of this, the second rather beguiling record from MGMT.    It's not as pop and pure as their first album, true: the youthful wanna be rock star swagger, the tinted IRONY of it all, but it's a more sophisticated work overall. Dramatically produced, with a wide palette, it is something you don't come across much these days: transporting.    I applaud MGMT, a band that let's not forget, quickly rose up the ranks from synthey, indie dancedom to near arena glory, for taking genuine risks and for not releasing something that sounds like Timbaland did some tinkering, or that Riahanna could guest vocal on. \\"Congratulations\\" turned out to be a complex prog rock album in 2010. I mean, that's cool. It's the lost, other soundtrack to the overlooked late 90's film, \\"Velvet Goldmine\\"--maybe a touch more cynical though.    The record echoes and shimmers. I always heard traces of space-era glam Bowie in their music, but this album takes it one step farther. It's Bowie for the new century.  The music is stronger on the earlier tracks; there are imprints of early Pink Floyd and the Flaming Lips, even traces of more recent breakout indie acts, like Sunset Rubdown, but it all comes together into a throbbing, seamless whole. It's an impressive work, somehow both retro and very of the moment.    People have cited an inaccessibility to this album, but personally I think the record is extremely melodic. \\"Flash Delirium\\" is a dance floor anthem if there ever was one. It's a beautiful track, artful, with propulsive beats, progressing into a bold theatricality and bursting away before you ever get bored. Opening track \\"It's Working\\" is a seductive, luscious little lullaby, and I'm not sure why it wasn't their choice of first single. Both \\"I Found a Whistle\\" and \\"Brian Eno\\" I can't get out of my head; they are catchy, amusing songs, pulled out of a music box from the hazy late 60's garage psych movement.    Much has been made of the cavorting, bizarre 12 minute romp \\"Siberian Breaks\\". It's really MGMT's version of the latter half of \\"Abbey Road\\"--a bunch of mini-tunes strung together, some of it futuristic glam, some of it harking back to 80's Vangelis electronica, some of it right out of \\"Village Green Preservation Society\\" era Kinks. It's extremely fun, and rather accomplished. I wasn't too crazy about the last 10 to 15 minutes of the album, it peters out a bit, but by that point it doesn't really matter, your brain's already fried and you have a big smile on your face.    What are they singing about? I don't know, underneath all the witty reverb, the hammy lyrics get lost--this might be some really complicated concept album that one day will become a left field Broadway smash or a Terry Gilliam film. In the end, this is a wildly inventive work from a talented Brooklyn band that, unlike so many other bands from that borough, really seemed to consider their audience without ever caving to it.

I have to say that watching the whole DVD adds a whole new dimension to the music.  It was a very happy video.  The animation comes from a very well known anime director, although the anime itself looks very retro, i.e. 70s and early to mid 80s.  I am extremely happy about the purchase of the DVD.

B00009ZYBY|5.0|SPOILER WARNING...IN CASE YOU NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />\\"Gladiator\\" is a Hollywood epic at its best: an action-packed adventure story with good guys versus bad guys, and some kind of uplifting moral message. Since it was made just a few years ago, the special effects are just fabulous. It's also a Hollywood epic at its worst: historically inaccurate and completely unrealistic.<br /><br />In other words, brace yourselves for a real treat!<br /><br />The main character, the righteous Roman general Maximus, is appointed emperor by an ailing Marcus Aurelius, who wants to stop his crooked son Commodus from taking power. Commodus, true to form, strangles the old man to death and has Maximus sold as a slave to a gladiator school, after first having butchered his family. Unfortunately for Commodus, Maximus nevertheless reaches Rome and the stage is set for a final combat between the two protagonists. Yes, Commodus himself challenges Maximus to a fight to the death at the Colosseum! Guess who wins? In the end scenes, the Roman senate restores power to itself as a dead Commodus lies on the arena. Maximus dies, too, but is immediately taken to Heaven where his family is already waiting for him.<br /><br />I don't deny that \\"Gladiator\\" is a great movie. But no, don't base a term paper about Roman history on it, please. Marcus Aurelius was an average Roman emperor who would have been quietly forgotten except by specialists, had it not been for his philosophical work \\"Meditations\\", arguably the most known and least read book in history. I tried to read it some time ago, and found it part unreadable, part morbid and pessimistic. Haven't you read it yet? You haven't missed much, citizen, I assure you. Yet, this work has earned Marcus Aurelius the reputation for being some kind of deep thinker and saintly man, when he was just another Roman dictator. And no, he had absolutely no plans to give power back to the senate (which wasn't elected anyway). In fact, he appointed Commodus his co-ruler!<br /><br />\\"Gladiator\\" is probably more correct when it paints Commodus as a villain - he had that reputation already during his lifetime. Indeed, it was Commodus, rather than his father, who was murdered by strangulation. Roman chronicles also claim that Commodus fought as a gladiator for his own higher amusement. Commodus is one of the few Roman emperors denied posthumous deification by the senate, showing how hated and unpopular he was. (This seems to have been one of the few effective powers the senate had during this time.)<br /><br />But what about Maximus? I must say that Maximus is the least believable character in the entire movie. But then, heroes never are believable, are they? There was very little morality in the Roman Empire, a system based on slavery, wars of conquest and super-exploitation of the peasantry. Not to mention the blood sports, the persecutions of Christians, mass crucifixions and what not. In order to make Maximus a morally upright person, \\"Gladiator\\" has to portray him almost as a Christian! He prays to his gods or ancestors in Christian fashion, acts a bit like Jesus \\"turning the other cheek\\" before smiting his enemies, and ends up in Heaven.<br /><br />If only.<br /><br />Despite these inaccuracies (which I as an annoying smart alec just have to point out), I nevertheless recommend this movie.

B00383ZTXO|4.0|With a final R-n-R Hall of Fame nod, a dead guitar player, my old fave band gets another polishing. The fact that the old Raw Power is way out of print helps and hinders this release. Many fans got the Ig-Mix and were either bowled over or thought it was crap. Myself, I did like the inclusion of some vocal and musical bits, but I felt like Iggy put the tracks together, set the levels on Penetration and Gimme Danger and walked out of the studio for a White Castle. The others were just plain distorted.    This re-remix adds a little more sparkle to the original CD release, but the prize is the live show. There are no real surprises for long time fans but for the new fans, there is just enough blend of living on the edge and really a tight rock and roll band. This has a bootleg feel with some audience participation along with what sounds like a stripped down soundboard tape. Lotsa piano early on which crowds out James for aural space. The price is right if you need another live show. At least these guys are not being petty like the MC5/Sonics Rendezvous mess.    For a little more, stroll over to [..] for yet another version with more goodies.

B0006SNK9E|5.0|Anyone who thinks of Sweet has some glam band from the 70's that did a few pop singles should hear this record. Sweet was in fact a band of the more pop music persuastion on their first 2 albums but for 1973's Sweet Fanny Adams they really found their sound. Their more popular songs and/or commercial hits were tracks there were never on the album and only released as singles. Blockbuster, Ballroom Blitz, Fox On The Run, The 6 Teens etc. Unfortunatly the band were only known for these songs but this album proves differently. Another sad fact was that Sweet never had an American release until 1974 with the album Desolation Boulevard. And it was a combination of tracks from this and the same titled follow up album in England. The remastered edition properly after all these years gives the curious a chance to hear the album the way it was meant to be. Most will be surprised to find that Sweet is quite a heavy band, big on masssive guitar sounds, solos, powerful drumming and that wall to wall vocal sound. Set Me Free is a breath of fresh air after being exposed to Little Willy for 30 years. It's pretty much one of those songs like Queen's Stone Cold Crazy or Budgie's Breadfan that could connect the dots to what would become speed metal. Heartbreak Today, No You Don't, Restless, and Into The Night are all fantastic pieces of early 70's heavy rock with a high dose of the glam. Although the songs never boarder on that cheesy teenie bopper feel the bands more popular singles have. Rebel Rouser and the cover of Peppermint Twist might be the only tracks that slightly resemble the groups Fox On The Run cuts. The title track is chock full of crunching powerful solos and fast heavy rocking. If you didnt know any better you might even say this is metal.     The bonus tracks contain the singles that the band is more known for although the B-sides are there and of course, its interesting that they are also heavier in nature, more in comparison with the albums. Need A Lot Of Lovin',Burnin' (which resembles Immigrant Song), Hell Raiser, and Rock n Roll Disgrace (which also sounds like Mott The Hoople's Rock N Roll Queen). It's easy to tell why Def Leppard loves these the guys so much, the approach to melodic and glammy yet anthemic hard driving rock was Sweet all around, and anyone whos been spinning the Best Of Sweet for years and had an interest in what the band did otherwise, this album is an essential. Really an unfortunate lost classic as the groups singles really overshadowed everything. And while Fox On The Run is an unabashed pop/rock gem, this stuff here should really be heard by more rock fans. Sweet were a heavy rock band with a penchant for glittery hit singles. This is the definite work of the group.

B002ZG997C|5.0|The Book of Eli is a a movie that may have you wonder, \\"what the world may be like if worldwide a natural or human disaster occurred?\\" Which may make you automatically think about the strain we put on the earth, as well as, the recent natural disasters that have plagued our planet approximately for a decade now. The cast played the movie as if times were \\"lost\\" and really makes you feel all of the emotions that come  and go throughout the unorthodox scenes. As always I feel like a movie that has Denzel Washington in the mix usually has a hidden message, or a lesson to be learned.   Just one of the lessons that was assummed throughout, and at the end movie, that should be practiced throughout our lives daily is: \\"Never judge a book by its cover.\\"
B000A2WNB2|5.0|I was nervous this DVD wouldn't be compatible with my U.S. DVD player, but it works fantastically.  I've heard the concert CD a hundred times, but it's great to see the 2001 Le Zenith show live.  There are *several* extra songs compared to the audio CD you get with the Hullaballoo Soundtrack (Unintended with the French audience sing-along en Englais is worth the admission price alone).<br /><br />It's nice to see Muse's earlier days and this concert is quite a contrast to the Uprising tour.  And who wouldn't want to see Matt with his spikey hair or a younger Dom with short hair and a patchwork sweater? (Chris is however timeless.)  The sound quality of the concert is great, and they've done a lot of interesting camera work and audience shots.  It has a more intimate feel than Wembley/Haarp, but it sounds just as solid. The music trends a little more somber, so I really enjoyed the audience's energy during Feelin' Good, Cave, New Born, Plug In Baby and Bliss.<br /><br />I can't wait to see the second \\"extras\\" DVD next and find out what the \\"Low Level Course Language\\" warning means.

Even the more \\"loved\\" sides have an aural authenticity that can't be denied.

B003405MF6|5.0|When one looks upon the \\"Mona Lisa\\" or the Sistine Chapel; you never compare it to anything. It just is. You marvel in it's beauty; a timeless statement. In the music world though, comparisons abound-until now. Mr. Beck's latest collection is, from start to finish, a piece of art that can never be copied or compared to anything else. It is not about guitar, but about music and the instrumentation blends and works together to create a sonic painting that we have not heard or experienced in a long time; since Miles Davis or Charlie Parker or Gil Evans. In this country we are actually not trained enough musically or socially to recognized this type of art and music immediately as we tend to compare it to what is being marketed to us at any given time.  This is as close to musical perfection in any genre and on any instrument as you are likely to experience for a long time. Savor it.

0393072231|5.0|If you have read any of Lewis's previous work, you expect to be entertained and educated at the same time.  This one does not disappoint, it's terrific.  It's the story of the handful of guys who saw through the mortgage bond scams and their odyssey in coming to grips with it.  Along the way, the reader gets the complete story of the lunacy and the despicable dopes who precipitated the crisis.  You will quickly see, for example, how the giant AIG went broke and why it was a sure thing.  You will also see why my brother-in-law's supposedly rock safe Triple A bonds lost 70% of their value.   It's too bad Lewis didn't investigate the issue BEFORE the crisis.  There is an element of Pulitzer's famous quote, \\"After the fact, any competent journalist can show why it was inevitable.\\"  Nevertheless, the legions of otherwise brilliant people who didn't see it coming astonishes. Read this book if you want to really understand what happened.  It will make you mad.

159668139X|3.0|This book is considered the modern bible of how to learn to weave on a multi-shaft loom. It sits in my book-case, and I do often refer to it because its handy for helping newbies, BUT.............it is very lightweight in content compared to the older out-of-print text books you can still find in libraries and second hand stores, despite their obvious handicaps of a lot of text and not enough illustrations.<br />It gets ticks for being set out as a series of lessons; visually the pages are not over-cluttered; the tutorials cover the material presented in that lesson; the charts are easy to understand. The text is on the whole easy to read and understand. The price is right, too!<br />All essential requirements for a basic text-book of any sort.<br />However, it is not the only weaving book that you will ever need, as it only goes so far in content, and gets you through the beginner stage. The patterns and drafts discussed are limited in range, and at some point you will be purchasing further books to further your skills in basic drafts let alone learn intermediate skills and special interest areas of weaving. You can rarely  look up something new in the hope that you will find it mentioned, let alone covered.<br />That said, it does have its place in a weaving library and as a learning tool, particularly if you purchase an old classic like  (New) Key to Weaving to go with it. That gives you the best of both worlds.
B00004TH83|5.0|I can't say anything more moving than the other reviewers. I wish some of the other songs she recorded were released.  She made 50 and their are only 12 on the CD. I would dearly love to hear the other 38.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and vowed right then and there that I would be buying this movie the moment it was released. The acting was fantastic and the story was amazing (even more so when you found out that it was based on truth). It had this motivating factor that had you wanting to walk out of the theater and do something good for someone. Just loved this movie and now I am happy that I own it for my DVD library!
B0002TJGQS|3.0|The price is great but can't tell if they are Lithium. My Seller, National Deals, shipped these batteries individually ziploced so I don't know if it is \\"original Maxell\\" as my other Maxell batteries says in it's packaging. The battery is stamped Hitachi Maxell,Ltd. Japan. It was also short on postage. Can't tell yet how long it will last.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I ordered Star Trek: The Next Generation - Complete Series from EImportSUS via the Amazon site.  The series came packaged in three separate sets, the first containing 18 DVDs.  I tried every one of the 18, but none of the discs would even load on one of my DVD players, but they do load and play on a second machine.  I have now watched 12 episodes (on three different discs) and without exception some break-up (pixelization) has occurred in every episode...some significant, some not so. I am certain my machines are not at fault because I have a DVD library exceeding 400 discs, including a recent purchase of the Cheers - Complete Set purchased direct from Amazon, and those, and all other discs play perfectly.  I attempted to contact the supplier (EImportSUS) but my email (forwarded through the Amazon site) received no response. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed with my purchase, but have decided not to pursue further action from the supplier due to the time and expense that would be required.
0143038419|5.0|I saw this book in a magazine after hearing good reviews from a friends and ordered it from Amazon. Reading Liz's journey through Italy, India and Indonesia was beautiful and entertaining. Each part was a completely different aspect that many feel at different points in their life. Like I've heard many others say, this book makes you want to travel and experience more in your own life. I loved this book and recommend it to anyone who asks.
0393316041|5.0|I know the stereotype of scientists. This guy would be the same great character if he were in any other line of work. It's hard to explain how brilliant he is in so many areas, and that's down to the attitude of having fun at whatever you do by doing what makes sense, not what tradition dictates.

B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a fabulous movie with a wonderful, feel good true story behind it. If you ever question your own life, think of where you came from. Michael Oher beat the odds. As a teacher, I could easily relate to the story, because I've had several Michael Oher's in my classroom. Unfortunately, my students don't always play out as well as his story played out. Great movie. The only disappointment are the extras the movie doesn't have that other great movies have included on their DVDs.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Buy the real version, with Sir David Attenborough. He is engaging and does not act like it is a pre-school class. Besides that, the insult is much worse because he completed his narration and everything was fine, so they had to essentially delete his already-existing narration to replace it with the Americanized obnoxiousness of Oprah.  The Attenborough version:  [[ASIN:B002UXRGM0 Life [Blu-ray]]]    Anyway, this series has footage that is superior to basically all previous documentaries. The film quality is simply awesome. Having said that, this is not as valuable or informative as many other series, such as Attenborough's amazing series of programs that he wrote (Life On Earth, Trials of Life, Life of... etc) which are far more insightful into really understanding things.
0061091480|5.0|This was officially the first \\"self help\\" book I've ever read.  In fact, it's the first book I've ever willfully read on my own (excluding the books I was forced to read in school and college).  It was amazing.  I felt like he was speaking directly to me and my specific problems from start to finish.  He has a completely contrarian view on SO many aspects of life that just makes you think \\"wow, I've never thought of it that way.\\"  I highly, highly recommend and I'll definitely read it again.

0307473473|5.0|This is an exciting, tense and well plotted thriller about the investigation into the disappearance of a teenage girl which happened almost 40 years ago. Mikael Blomkvist is a Swedish journalist whose career appears to be ruined when he is convicted of libeling a wealthy businessman. Then a wealthy industrialist, Henrik Vanger, hires him to be a private investigator and, while pretending to help write his autobiography, find out what happened to his grandniece after she disappeared September 24, 1966. On that day an accident occurred on the bridge connecting Hedeby island to the mainland of Sweden. On the island the Vanger family had gathered and when Harriet goes missing Henrik suspects that some member of his family is responsible. Blomkvist's investigation brings him together with Lisbeth Salander, the eponymous girl with a dragon tattoo (and many others), a young anti-social misfit and hacker who works freelance for Milton Security. Their digging reveals some crazy secrets held by members of the Vanger family when they find out what happened to Harriet.<br /><br />After establishing the characters and story line the investigation moves along at a very exciting pace with all the furniture of a great thriller: leads, dead ends, action, pavement pounding, shocking surprises, horrific crimes and charming villains. Both the libel case and the missing person case get resolved while the flawed heroes find redemption.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Mention Doctor Who to those that experienced the show in the late seventies or eighties & what do you get? Oh yeah that sci-fi childrens'series from the BBC, it's too bad they didn't have the budget or effects to pull it off. Now ( and I as well  was ignorant of how far the series had come until as late as fall 2009) the series that originated in 63 & was briefly out of action returned in 2004/2005 & it is superb. Last fall I watched ( by accident) Planet of the Dead ( one of the 2009 group of Dr. Who Specials) & I was mesmerized, great acting, special effects were very good & the location set-ups & number of cast was really first rate. As well this was a product that adults could appreciate. I had to have more & after catching the final shows of the David Tennant run I ordered the complete fourth season ( 2008) DVD Set.  This Doctor Who Series is running full tilt, lots of drama, emotion, action.That's the formula, don't blink or you will miss something important! It's a roller coaster ride that starts a queue of events & doesn't let up until the end. A fine drama by any definition. The series starts with the special Voyage of the Dammed & I would suggest unless you have been with the good doctor in recent times to start your viewing here & follow the order of the 6 discs. The reason being disc five is loaded with guest stars & by the time you go through the first 4 discs you will have a pretty good idea of who's who ( sorry about that).   This 6 disc set is loaded with extras. There are extensive audio commentaries by those in the know from the series, trailers, scene selector, David's Video Diary, deleted scenes & disc 6 or Doctor Who Confidential shows how each episode was fashioned & shows their ingenuity in creating sets & problem solving, quite fascinating you'll see. Add to that a series 4 episode guide. I rate this 5 stars. The people working on this series really care & it shows. I will lay down one disclaimer don't buy this for young children as thereare frightening moments & just between the 2 of us after viewing Silence In The Library I have been sleeping with the night light on!
B0039UTDFG|1.0|My fellow Americans, please do not buy this edition and instead buy the one with Sir David's narration. Let's show the world that this atrocity is NOT approved by us. I gave one star but there is no rating system to show how a work of excellence in science and art for ages, could be turned into a boring bed time story when the narrator has NOOOOO idea what she is talking about,  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
B001GCUNW6|5.0|I had seen this movie at the theater. When we bought our Blu-ray DVD player, I decided to make this one of the first movies we watched. The color and detail are amazing - it is so hard to believe that this is done with computer animation. It is so life like. The character are really \\"fleshed out\\" in this one. Manny's approaching fatherhood, Diego's unrest, Sid's desire to be a \\"mommy\\" - just the entire movie is lots of fun. The script is incredible. Some of the punch lines are very funny. You can see where the creators \\"borrowed\\" from other movies like Jarassic Park, Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of the Earth, etc. But it fits in so smoothly, you really don't care. The scene with the \\"laughing gas\\" is hysterical! I think adults as well as kids will love this film. Like I said, I got the Blu-ray and it's a whole different experience in movie watching.
0340822783|4.0|I picked up this book in charity shop for the princely sum of a £1 expecting it to be a flakey summer holiday type read, which I could enjoy without having to use any of my brain's synapses.  I wasn't entirely sure I understood where it was coming from for the first 20 pages or so, but stuck with it as the writing style is good and I have to say the more I read the more I was pleasently surprised.  This is my first encounter with David Mitchell and I will be trying his other books in the future.  I won't go into the detail as other people have done this for me but this is a book with real content and substance without being too obvious. It is well worth reading and committing the time to. The only bit which annoyed me slightly was the post-apocalyptic story and that's purely because the use of language took a little bit of getting used to, it was still worth sticking with and I would recommend it in an instant.
B000JLSM00|5.0|I never saw the film until this BLU RAY release and I must say...this DVD is worth it's weight in gold.  The West never looked better and JOHN FORD made sure of that!  Wayne gives an Oscar worthy performance AND yes...he was a great actor!  GREAT performances from the whole cast and I was really surprised by JEFF HUNTER!  Natalie Wood was fresh from REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and her sister Lana played Debbie as a small child.  All GREAT stuff! GREAT extras too!
B001HOF8AA|4.0|Very good rockabilly noir ala the outstanding Devil Doll's \\"Queen of Pain\\" release from a few years ago. If you like this disc you must check out the Queen of Pain cd, which does this one better IMHO. That said this a great genre that is a lot of fun. The mixture of rockabilly and a jazz noir sound with a chanteuse singer who doesn't take it all too seriously is a great diversion in these tough times.

0143116738|1.0|As a tutor of many bright, capable and learning-disabled students, I looked forward to reading Ken Robinson's book.  In the end I was quite disappointed.  The book has an interesting premise that when people find occupations that match their passions and natural abilities, they find fulfillment (are in their \\"element\\").  The problem is that the support for this argument is based upon anecdotes rather than any meaningful survey or statistical analysis.  Most of the examples given are exceptional people who have been successful in the arts, areas in which a large number of people would love to work but for which they can expect to get paid little or no money.  Yes, it is true that members of the Beatles became successful in spite of their lack of interest in school, but to say that their path to fame and fortune can be reproduced for the many young men who fantasize about being a great rock musician is too big a leap to be taken seriously.<br /><br />The challenge for educators and society in general is how to educate students of different abilities and learning styles so that they have the knowledge and skills they need to find an occupation that is both a good fit and generates a livable income.  My students need guidance as they move from high school to post-graduation training/education and this book did not provide me with any meaningful additional tools with which to do this.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|At first I laughed when I read that Slash had his 1st solo cd coming out.  I had always considered the 2 Snakepit records to be his solo albums, but I guess he didn't.  Then I read that \\"Slash\\" would feature different lead singers on each track and I knew I wouldn't like it.  After seeing the list of guest vocalists, many of whom I'd heard of but never actually heard (like Andrew Stockdale and Adam Levine), I knew the album would be awful.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.  From the opening riff of \\"Ghost,\\" a track sung by Ian Astbury of the Cult (with rhythm guitars by Izzy), I realized this disc had some potential.  After hearing it in its' entirety, I'm waaay impressed.  This cd is the equivalent of putting your iPod on shuffle and hearing 14 really good and really different tunes.<br /><br />Highlights include the aforementioned \\"Ghost,\\" \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" featuring Fergie, \\"By the Sword\\" (Adam Stockdale), \\"Gotten\\" (Adam Levine) and \\"Back to Cali\\"(Myles Kennedy.  The only track that does nothing for me is \\"Saint is a Sinner Too\\" by Rocco de Luca.  That one seems to go nowhere, but that's OK.  It's surrounded by 13 other great rock songs that cover so much ground musically while still being full-on rock.
1400031001|2.0|Mr. Boyd's sentences are beyond reproach, but it seems to me that the bodily organ referenced in the title should have been a different one since the protagonist is shown nailing every woman in sight once he gets out of boarding school, with no reflection or regret about how he treats them beyond that.  He marries the wrong woman without thinking about it much, he sets up with a mistress without it occurring to him to get a divorce first, and then blithely goes on to bed with various married women (even those married to his friends, who could be hurt) and even, eventually, the teenage girlfriend of his recently deceased son.  He never changes in this regard. Obviously this is a fictional character, but my point is that as a woman it is not \\"entertaining\\" to read an entire novel in which there is no one to identify with and in which the protagonist treats my gender as largely a convenience to satisfy his primal urges.  If the defense to this is that Mr. Boyd is painting a picture of a \\"typical\\" Englishman during the twentieth century, then God help us all. Imagine the Jane Austen novels (or, more chronologically correct, those of Elizabeth Bowen) changing so that in every drawing room scene, the female protagonist produces a large hammer, pounds the scrotum of the male lead into pulp, and then continues on with drawing room conversation:  I daresay no man would want to read the entire novel.

0061922315|5.0|This is a truly outstanding book that will resonate in the memories and hearts of all readers.<br /><br />Kavita, a young mother in India mourns the loss of her first daughter in 1984.  The baby was killed by her father's family who wanted only sons.  In 1985 when her second daughter is born, Kavita hides her pregnancy and quite resourcefully saves her child's life.<br /><br />Asha, which means Hope was originally named Usha by her natural mother, Kavita.  In 1986, Usha/Asha was adopted from an orphanage in India when she was a year old.  A couple from the United States adopts her and is just appalled at female infanticide in India.  Asha was found wearing a thin bracelet that Kavita left on her wrist, a silent plea that her daughter be given a chance to live.<br /><br />The Thakkars, both of whom are doctors adopt Asha.  Somer is a pediatrician and Krishnan is a neurosurgeon who have not been able to have a child.  One's heart really goes out to Somer when she learns that she is not able to conceive.  One really feels her pain when she attends a friend's baby shower and an insenstive guest makes rude remarks about Somer being the only one there who does not have a child.  You just want to kick Bouncing Becky in the shins for making Somer feel bad about her losses.  One really feels for Somer when she ducks out of the shower, understandably no longer able to fake pleasure at another's good fortune.<br /><br />Krishnan immigrated from India to the United States and, like Kavita, hoped for a better life there.  He saw medical school as his ticket to a better and safer life.<br /><br />Somer, on the other hand has no personal ties to India.  Once they adopt Asha, they rebuild their ties to India and the family they have who still live there.  The Thakkars' biggest fear is that Asha might try to find her natural mother and other relatives in India and want to know the circumstances behind her adoption.<br /><br />The story covers the years 1984 to 2009.  Somer, Kavita and Asha each lend their voices to the story and each brings her perspective about motherhood.  These three women also have vastly different perspectives about India and Indian culture.  One very poignant lesson each come away with is that \\"Mother India does not love all her children equally\\" and this lesson is reinforced many times in their own lives.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and beautiful story that is like a sunrise.  It is full of hope, as Asha is named and promise.  It is full of rich colors and the tapestries of people's lives.  Each strand is brilliantly interwoven to create a masterpiece.<br /><br />George Harrison's stellar 1969 classic \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is the soundtrack to this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

0061673730|4.0|There's one point in this book where the narrator says that unlike Phaedrus, he doesn't believe in Quality as a monist principle to life, and he neither believes in the Aristotlian view of Truth as the single principle to life. Quality is dubbed for romantic reality, Truth is dubbed for classical reality, and so the dualism between form and function becomes the overriding principal inquiry of the story. Pirsig, in his afterword to the edition I read, identifies the crux of the story as an attempt to reconcile technology and nature, but I don't sense that reconciling these two facets of our world is as culturally relevant as he claims. I wasn't born during this time, so I can't say if the cultural climate of the mid-70s really sensed this culture-bearing theme that Pirsig has defined to be relevant to this era. Technology and nature seem to play minor roles to the major theme of dualism in the story: between materialism and perspectivism, which can also be stated as objectivism and subjectivism, or metaphysics and physics, or as, Pirsig calls it, classicalism (Truth; Reason) and romanticism (Quality; Excellence.)    Phaedrus claims that Quality is more significant than Truth, that romanticism is more significant than logic, that the world is run by Quality as an overriding principal that guides humanity and the world. But quality lacks definition and Pirsig and Phaedrus are painfully aware of this. Instead of defining it, Phaedrus breaks apart reason as being historically manipulative ever since the rejection of the Sophists and the emergence of Aristotle, who broke away with the monist principle of quality with specialization, categorization, and stultifying soul-crushing reason. Phaedrus rejects the ideas of reason as the overall goal of humanity, but he tantrums against it like a child. At first read, it seems that Phaedrus is saying that reason is inadequate in pursuing truth. But when I continued reading, I realized Phaedrus really believed that reason is an off-shoot of Quality; which is excellence. But what is quality really... how can it be defined, not described? It can't, and so there's a conflict between Quality and Truth.     I find that the conflict is best resolved by the idea of Harmony. With Harmony, Quality and Reason, objectivity and subjectivity, Truth and Excellence are united, and therein lies the holy trinity of dualism: the synthesis between the subjective and objective-- Harmony. Pirsig seems to have really made an important realization at this point of the story/inquiry, but the realization is sadly left behind, and again we have to endure the obsession with Quality and the tearing down of Truth which is later expanded upon with Phaedrus's personal narrative in college-- his championing the Sophists and denouncing Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Phaedrus's narrative is interesting and provides a historical background for this infinite debate, but does not answer the inquiry which Pirsig pursues. It is Harmony that is most impressive to me, not Phaedrus's insistent cry for Quality and immature subversion of the Establishment, which he dubs, 'The Church of Reason.' Phaedrus wants to be celebrated so much, he doesn't see the faults of his own views. Quality is a vague word and doesn't do half as good a job describing the philosophy of life as Harmony does.     Here is a passage on page 273 that really seems to answer the major philosophical debate for me:     \\"It is not the facts but the relation of things that results in the universal harmony that is the sole objective reality. What guarantees the objectivity of the world in which we live is that this world is common to us with other thinking beings. Through the communications we have with other men we receive from them ready-made harmonious reasonings. We know that these reasonings do not come from us and at the same time we recognize in them, because of their harmony, the work of reasonable beings like ourselves. And as these reasonings appear to fit the world of our sensations, we think we may infer that these reasonable beings have seen the same thing as we; thus it is that we know we haven't been dreaming. It is this harmony, this quality if you will, that is the sole basis for the only reality we can ever know.\\"     This passage is enlightening in consideration of its context, which is the human, subjectivist tendency to select the facts around us. Our selection determines our reality. When our selection is not harmonious with others, then our reality becomes questionable. Until Einstein can demonstrate the Theory of Relativity (which I won't pretend to understand), it was only a theory. Only after it is \\"accepted\\" and harmoniously received by others, can it become known as a reality as we know it. Which brings a good segue into a major concept in the narrative: mental illness. This is exactly what mental illness is. When someone's mind is disharmonious with that of the world around him, he goes insane.     This contention also brings to light the idea of Value. It is the selection of facts and society's acceptance of those facts that defines Value, and I think this is what Pirsig means by the subtitle, 'An Inquiry into Value'. Harmony seems to me as the great lesson that is taught in this unwieldy, exhilarating, experimentally complex, and awesome book. Not Quality.

B000NIZPKE|5.0|I love Sony, but I don't know why they don't just include this battery as the standard one that comes with their camcorders.  Oh wait, because they want you to buy this one!!!  This easily gives you two to three times more recording time over the standard battery, but you can keep them both charged to have a spare.  Other than that, there isn't much to say!  It charges, it last a long time, and then you do it again!  You will easily love your camcorder more with this battery.  It makes it much more useful than with the standard one that's in the box.  I highly recommend it to everyone with a camcorder that it will work with!

1439138311|5.0|This haunting, beautiful story is simply written but delivers a powerful punch.  Eilis, through no choice of her own, lives in two very different worlds: her native Ireland and her adopted America.  This book narrates Eilis's very parallel experiences in each of those worlds. Each experience, whether it be sitting around the morning breakfast table, meeting a boy at a dance, or participating in the work world, yields two opposite scenarios between the two countries.  When, eventually Eilis makes her final choice as to which country she will ultimately live out her life, she knows and will forever reflect on how very different her life would have been had she made the other choice.  This book will leave you thinking about Eilis, her choices, and her resulting life.  But it will also make you reflect on your life; how choices, maybe only one choice, totally change the course of your life.  This thought provoking, haunting story will have you asking the old unanswerable question, \\"What if...?\\"

1592402690|5.0|This review is from: Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles (Hardcover)  I've read many Beatles books which were all fine and good, but this was just one of those books that had me captivated. If you know the Beatles' story in and out like myself, you will still find this book quite interesting, or at least it's a book you should read just to get a different feel than your typical bio.    Geoff E. goes through all the Beatles albums he engineered, techniques that were used in getting their sound, incidents and experiences with the Beatles, and his own observations during recording sessions. I felt like I was part of the action while I was reading (always a good sign!) and was entertained by all of the stories he told. It gives you an even better idea of them as people in the studio- granted through his eyes, but it's still an interesting viewpoint nonetheless.    As one might expect, there is a lot of technical lingo in the book which was, well...technical lingo- some of it I was kinda clueless on or didn't understand simply because I'm no sound engineer, but it was still neat to read how certain sounds were made, little things I didn't know about. I got a little bit of musical-sound education out of it so I didn't mind.    Like other reviewers said, Geoff does favor Paul (which he also mentions having the best rapport with him, so it's not like he hides it), but to me it wasn't obnoxious or anything that overshadowed the basis of the book. I'm a huge Lennon fan myself but I'm always interested in what other people think or what they've witnessed about him or the others, positive or not. It is a personal recollection and how things were through his eyes, so I went into the book keeping that in mind. He didn't engineer all of their albums which I wish he had- I would've loved to have learned more about say, how A Hard Day's night was engineered, but at the same time you get a great picture of how things went down through the albums hedid work on, which is most of them anyway.    I love the personal spin on it. It's not by some guy who compiled a bunch of facts from all over and spit out a book- he was there when the music was being made first-hand, and had a big part in creating that sound. And considering the amount of time he spent with them in the studio- I'd say he's pretty fit to recount his experiences!    To cap off, I really like how this was written. I found Geoff E. to be a straight-forward kinda guy with some great ideas, of course with his own opinions. He has a conventional way about him, yeah, but mind you, he's creative. Gotta give him that. I don't know, I found him pretty down to earth for the most part, relate-able in a way.  Beatle fans, read the book and get the experience! It's really great!!
1439190275|5.0|I have been a fan of the Atkin's Diet since its inception which if I recall was a feature in Cosmopolitan magazine circa 1971.  The new version is probably easier to read and more convincing about its scientific underpinnings.  However, it is not the content so much as the mere publication that is pleasing.  It is a sign that another wave of support for the Atkin's Diet is forming.  It is gratifying to see that the scientific evidence has accumulated to support what I knew all along, some people do better without many carbs.  You've got to wonder why this concept is so riddled with controversy.  On the one hand the scientific community has known for generations now about diseases that are associated with sugar ingestion.  This is not rocket science.  To suggest health and well being is affected by sugar ingestion should not be controversial.   Thank goodness \\"the book\\" is back and a few more people will be educated about the health and maintenance of their bodies.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Presented by Peter Jackson, \\"District 9\\" is a unique take on sci-fi action with character-driven story. The film begins with \\"documentary\\" footage of a huge spaceship that arrives from outer space. It appears over the city of Johannesburg and hovers there for more than 28 years. The aliens that have come with the machinery are all contained in the area \\"District 9.\\" Now the government and human citizens alike want them go away.     Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) works for a big corporation, Multi-National United. He is assigned to relocate (forcibly) the unwelcome visitors from outer space, now residents of the city's now notorious \\"District 9,\\" to another place where the government promises a better life. Things go terribly wrong for bureaucratic MNU employee Wikus, however, when he stumbles upon a mysterious cylinder with black matter in it. Not exactly a bad person, but Wikus is kind of a man who always does something he is not supposed to do.    What ensues is a tale of an unlikely hero trapped in two or more rival factions. The entertaining story is told with lots of actions and a bit of dark humor.    Film fans may point out that some of the film's subject matters have been explored before (the 1988 film \\"Alien Nation\\" directed by Graham Baker, for instance). Sometimes science fictions with aliens from outer space can be a metaphor for immediate political issues. Director Neill Blomkamp may not be as sophisticated or psychological as, say, Don Siegel and his classic \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" - \\"District 9\\" contains considerable amount of gores and graphic violence - but the film works nonetheless, with thrilling actions and characters you care.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|In my hunt for HDMI cables I came across these and I thought \\"hmmm why the hell is amazon selling electronic accessories of this kind?\\" and admittedly I was a little skeptical of the ability of these cables to perform as expected. I decided \\"what the heck\\" and gave them a try. I went ahead and ordered 2 of these. I waited for these cables with the type of anticipation that a child waits for Christmas. On a sunny day I came home only to find a package on my doorstep and I immediately knew that it could only be one thing so I snatched it up immediately and proceeded to opening the box. The packaging in itself was great in my opinion and added to the presentation. The cables each came neatly coiled up in their own boxes and it felt like 2 Christmas presents. I was impressed with the quality and workmanship of the cables and they performed as expected and I would recommend these to anyone looking for something of quality with a good price

0393072231|5.0|Great Read!  I enjoyed reading about other people involved in the financial mess besides the usual suspects.  Michael Lewis does a great job developing his characters.  It was interesting reading about the individuals who made money betting against the subprime mortgage market - you will learn a lot about credit default swaps issued as a bet on the likelihood of these loans defaulting.  It's an eye opening read on the behind the scenes work of Wall Street.

0439023483|5.0|I didn't meant to write a review, just rate it five stars.  This book was meant for youth, but it's so fast paced, I couldn't put it down. For people hoping to fall into the Twilight trap (and I can't stand twigliht) this is for you to check out.  The story is completely engaging and I highly reccomend it to any adult I know.  I didn't care for the ending as it forces you to read the sequel rather than just being completely a stand alone part of a trilogy.  Oh well, guess I'll have to read the sequel even though I hear it's just teenage Twilight angst like.
0618918248|5.0|\\"You don't become an atheist so much as find out that's what you are.\\"  Christopher Hitchens said this in an interview with Sally Quinn.

If you have ever had any doubts, ever been the slightest bit skeptical of religion or god's existence, you owe it to yourself to read this book.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|Sandra Bullock has so much charm, it takes a lot to spoil a movie she stars in. But this movie almost succeeds.     Vulgarity and just plain stupid scenes almost sink this movie. There are several cringe scenes (painful-cringe not funny-cringe). At the end of the movie the two stars manage to remain standing with their dignity (mostly) intact, despite all the mud thrown on them by the director and screenwriters. I'm surprised someone with as much star power as Sandra Bullock would put up with all that.     If you're like me, you'll want to keep your finger ready on the fast-forward button when you watch this movie.
0375826742|1.0|If you have read and enjoyed Eragon and Eldest, I suppose you'll feel you have to read Brisingr. But honestly, you don't. You'll miss almost nothing by skipping Brisingr. I challenge those who liked Brisingr to come up with anything in the book that is crucial to the story \\"cycle\\". Oh, I guess I can think of one thing (SPOILER ALERT ON) (the Darth Vader impersonation...)(SPOILER ALERT OFF), but I think that was a completely unnecessary and undesirable development. Honestly, I think Eragon fans should spare themselves the misery of this wordy navel-gazing book and just wait for the summary in the fourth book -- that is if Paolini can wrap it up in one book. This book is a shocking downgrade from Eragon and Eldest. It taints the complete franchise. Paolini could have cut out 90% of this book and finished the trilogy - I wish he had. So many things bother me about this book. One major problem is Eragon's regression as a dragon rider. The Eragon we meet in Brisingr wouldn't be able to defeat Ayra in a fight -- seriously. If not for a lucky accident, a dwarve assasin would have killed him. This kid represents the \\"great hope\\" of the Varden? Please. You almost get the sense that Christopher Paolini has lost interest. As I neared the book's end, I couldn't believe it. This is it? I don't even know where to begin to dissect this disaster. Honestly, read the summary in Book 4, and go from there.

B00070QXL8|5.0|The movie was wonderful.  Mark stills adores Bridget, which is what the viewers were after, and Daniel is still after his Bridg.    However, in this movie I was almost pulling for Daniel because Mark simply was a snob.  Many female viewers can identify with Bridge and I think that made the movie successful.  The one thing I didn't like was making Bridgett act like Lucille Ball in \\"I Love Lucy.\\" We westerners have had enough of \\"Lucy\\" and her silly musings.    Also, in Bridgett Jones's Diary, Bridge was a good size and quite beautiful.  In Edge of Reason, she was made to look dumpy, red-faced, no make up and did some of the stupidest things I have ever seen. (climbing on Mark's roof? another classic Lucy thing). The clothes were awful, and non flattering. No wonder Renee paid $2,500 a day for a spa when she got back to LA.    I still loved her.  The acting was superb, lots of emotion, facial expressions were great, I even loved her tears.  Mark was demeaning to Bridge and why in the name of the planet did you want to insert someone like Rebecca Gilless.  She added absolutely nothing to the movie. I don't think the newspaper column meant for the lesbian to be a challenge for Bridge. I'm eagerly waiting for number 3, just please listen to reviews. Renee is great!!!
B002ZG983M|5.0|Somewhere, Mark Millar won't be rolling over in his grave. That's because 1) he's not dead, and 2) his comic book KICK-ASS gets the jawdropping cinematic treatment. I lost my mind a couple of times while watching this film, and I plan on catching this sucker again ASAP. With a movie title like it's got, it must've been problematic trying to promote and advertise this motion picture. But it's so wildly entertaining that I've no doubt word-of-mouth buzz alone will propel it to box office supremacy. It's the definition of a water cooler movie.<br /><br />Step up. Take a stand. Make a difference. Be a person of conviction. Put on a costume. Kick asss. I don't want to spill too many things, and this film has so many terrific moments, especially if you're a die-hard comic book guy like me, and it'd be too easy to drop a spoiler. The story has things to say about how comic books impact our culture, how today's near instantaneous forms of communication give us instant gratification and a wider scope of influence. Our central character, Dave, his legend spreads like a virus.<br /><br />\\"With no power comes no responsibility... except that wasn't true.\\" Teenager Dave Lizewski says that later on in the film, but before that, at the start of the film, he and his loser pals are hanging out in a comic book shop and Dave wonders aloud why no one has ever tried to become a superhero in real life. Not too much later, he dons a colorful snorkeling suit (purchased on E-bay) and begins patrolling the city at night. Dave Lizewski has no special skills whatsoever. The first time he engages in a fight, he doesn't do too well, and this is probably more true to life than anything else that could've happened. And I guess Dave's super powers are good intentions and a certain undauntedness because he keeps on keeping on. His next skirmish, he becomes an overnight YouTube sensation.<br /><br />The first real-life \\"superhero,\\" Dave inspires other costumed vigilantes, and it's around this point, when we're introduced to Damon and Mindy Macready, that we know we're seeing something off, something audacious and subversive and just friggin' cool. The Macreadys form a father-daughter crimefighting team called Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, and, unlike Dave, this pair is the real deal; they're the scourge of New York's criminal underworld. Nicolas Cage breaks his streak of stupendously horrid performances to deliver a fair bit of acting. Big Daddy has got issues. He's obsessed with taking down a New York crime lord (Mark Strong), and yet he also loves his adorable eleven-year-old daughter whom, by the way, he's trained to be an unstoppable killing machine from an early age. For her birthday, he gives her twin butterfly knives. That is some crazy, disturbed fatherly love. If nothing else, Cage as Big Daddy also occasionally launches into a pretty nifty homage to Adam West.<br /><br />Not that the film stays strictly faithful to its source. Little things were altered here and there, and two big plot elements were significantly altered, one referring to Dave's personal high school life, the other is in regards to a relevant side character. I can't say much more than that, other than I can sort of see why those changes were made for the film.<br /><br />Here, eat some adjectives: Irreverent, satiric, hilarious, profane, dysfunctional, and uber-violent, although not as violent or gory as Millar's comic book. This film is family friendly in the same way that Big Daddy demonstrates admirable parenting skills. The screenplay is sharp; the soundtrack fits the moments. The movie simultaneously lampoons and wallows in its comic book roots, and the opening scene sets the tone. The cast is great; the other actors do exceedingly well (British guy Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski just right), but let's not fcuk around here, young Chloe Moretz steals this movie, and hers is the breakout character by far. Hit-Girl, eleven years old and gleefully ending people's lives with this big grin on her face, has to be, just has to be, one of the baddest, most lethal, most potty-mouth superheroes ever put to cinema. Sue me for being inappropriate, but all those just-mentioned qualities add up to one big ball of awesome. Hit-Girl is bananas.<br /><br />By the way, John Romita, Jr. also won't be rolling over in his grave, for the same reasons cited above.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features include: a pretty dry but informative audio commentary by director Matthew Vaughn, \\"It's On! The Comic Book Origin of KICK-ASS\\" - a documentary nicely exploring KICK-ASS's comic book roots and including interviews with co-creators Mark Millar and John Romita, and Jr, inker Tom Palmer and colorist Dean White - and we also get to see the art process as it goes from pencils to inks to colors (00:20:34 minutes); the Art of KICK-ASS - still segments dedicated to Storyboards, Costumes, On-Set Photography, Production Design, and John Romita, Jr's Art for the film; and the marketing archive (comprised of the theatrical trailer, the profanity-laced Redband Hit Girl trailer, and promotional movie posters and images produced for the North American and International campaigns).n on her face, has to be, just has to be, one of the baddest, most lethal, most potty-mouth superheroes ever put to cinema.

0316010669|4.0|Several of the serious criticisms of this book are well-founded, but it also has several extraordinary virtues, not the least of which is superb writing.  Others have reasonably criticized the book for its lack of coherence, but Gladwell is a journalist and not a thinker.  What did you expect?  Personally, I found the thesis, or theses, of this book, for there are several, much more compelling than the single thesis of The Tipping Point, which is really just a mathematical construct applied arbitrarily to a number of disparate real-world situations with have entirely different dynamics.  Nonetheless I enjoyed that book for one of the main reasons I enjoyed this one: for its engaging writing about human behaviour.    Blink, though, offers us a number of important, insightful, but disjunctive perspectives on human decision making.  The title is catchy, no doubt, and probably sold more books than \\"The Vagaries of Human Decision Making\\" would have, but the many critical reviews found here (which themselves are likely to significantly affect, not only the book's sales, but its enduring reputation) show that the title is both inappropriate and misleading, and if it was the publisher's choice, crammed down the author's throat, Gladwell might want to think seriously about getting a different publisher, or better, publishing the book himself - who needs publishers these days, anyway?    This book would have been worth publishing just for the sake of bringing John Gottman's research to the attention of the general public, or Paul Ekman's (the expert on human facial expressions).  In fact this book contains the seeds of many potentially important books, and it also cries out for a true intellectual synthesis of all of this provocative, and often contradictory evidence of how we make up our minds at many different levels.  Gladwell is not the man to deliver on such projects, but so what?  I am very glad that he has given us what he has.    My principal criticism of the book, echoing another reviewer (and the reason I give it only 4 stars), is that many of the summaries of the scientific studies are too superficial, and leave unaswered too many critical questions which would occur to the intelligent, or scientifically literate reader.  It's nearly always a mistake to write down to your audience.  Isaac Asimov, in his 100+ scientific books, proved that even the driest and most complex material can be made absorbing to anyone who is likely ever to read a serious non-fiction book sometime in his adult life.  And Gladwell is twice the writer Asimov was. But, for whatever reason, Gladwell has given us in many places content-light, and again, I suspect the hand of his mass-market publisher, shaping this talented and impressionable writer and journalist into a mere entertainer, and not steering him instead towards greater rigor, and significance.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I loved the movie and especially the film footage from my hometown of (sad) Flint, Michigan.  I had heard from my mother long ago about the hired corporate goons who attacked the factory workers with baseball bats.  And the following retaliation.  But I did NOT know that the soldiers who were called to the scene had their guns trained on the corporate goons, not the workers.      And sadly, I learned about \\"dead peasant\\" insurance policies taken out by corporations (like Wal Mart) on their lower echelon employees.  It looks like the company was hoping that the employees died as insurance payoffs would go to the company, not the families of the deceased.  How gruesome.    It's hard to see capitalism as a predatory evil, but on close examination it appears to be.  Can you say \\"Goldman Sachs\\".

She started to refer to is as the pig movie as i do to this day.   I recomment it to everyone young and old. It is just fantastic.  I also recently watched castle in the sky and i will not let my daughter watch that one. It is too violent in theme and action. It also took me a while to get into it too but i really do not care to much for it.  When Spirited away is refered to as Miyazakis masterpeice it truly is.  Enjoy.

The whole thing was handled with class and the new actors did a superb job of recreating their counterparts while still being fresh and unique.  If you are a hard core Trekker then you MUST see this if you haven't already.  If you are wondering what all the hype about Star Trek is, you gotta see this.  Even if you're not in to the Sci-Fi genre at all, this is a must see movie.  Too bad the Acadamy Awards are so political and ruled by fluff; this movie should have OWNED every other movie that came out last year!  If you are not interested now, please check your pulse; it's quite possible your heart has stopped pumping.  If that is the case, watch this movie and your blood will flow again.<br /><br />In case you didn't catch it from the above review: THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ANYONE ALIVE TODAY!!!!!
B00333NCTM|4.0|I Am Ozzy is a quick and fun read. Ozzy goes for a conversational and light tone as he tells his hilarious road stories, but like some recent rock and roll autobiographies that I've recently read ([[ASIN:0061351431 Slash]] & [[ASIN:1416511946 The Heroin Diaries]]), Ozzy devotes an over-proportionate amount of time going over and over his alcohol and drug abuse. I was afraid that the book might turn into a dissertation about what happens when you become an addict, then hypocritically preach to the reader about staying off drugs. And sure, Ozzy spent a lot of time recounting his drug and alcohol induced escapades, but he NEVER preached. On the contrary, he couldn't care less what the reader did with his stories of mayhem while being wasted out of his mind.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the book are the most fun and contain the most amounts of laugh out loud moments. And I mean laugh out loud; I'd be sitting on a plane with my [[ASIN:B0015T963C Kindle]] and suddenly break out laughing like a madman. You'd have thought I was Ozzy based on some of the looks that I got.<br /><br />Ozzy starts by talking us through his life leading up to Black Sabbath; you might think this to move a bit slowly, but it doesn't because of how interesting it was to hear about the development of one of the world's most renowned rock & roll bands. Plus, if you're an Ozzy fan like me, the anticipation of already knowing what it's all leading up to keeps the pages turning at a quick pace. The book is a treat once Ozzy gets into the story of Black Sabbath and the crazy and comical stories that occurred during this period. Ozzy spends a deserved portion of the book on the pre-Black Sabbath and Black Sabbath era.<br /><br />Ozzy finishes off the first two-thirds of the book with the demise of Sabbath and the start of his solo career over the first two records ([[ASIN:B000063DFT Blizzard of Ozz]] & [[ASIN:B000063DIR Diary of a Madman]]). The combination of this being only a 3 year period and Ozzy's limited ability to remember much due to his alcohol and drug abuse make this part of the book relatively and sadly too short. Nevertheless, it is a part of the book that is filled with classic, comical and of course one of the most tragic moments.<br /><br />The last third of the book is primarily devoted to Ozzy's rise to worldwide star-status through MTV's [[ASIN:B00005JLBW The Osbournes]], his continuing accounts of drug abuse and alcoholism, and his eventual road to a cleaner way of life. Unlike the first two-thirds of the book, little time or mention is made of the making of his subsequent records and how he recruited the personnel for his new band(s). I would have liked to have seen more on his road escapades with Zakk Wylde versus the amount of time he took to talk about the day to day filming of The Osbournes.<br /><br />Anyway, I Am Ozzy is a good, funny read and I'd recommend it to Ozzy fans and casual readers alike. Here's a funny story that's not included in Ozzy's book: In early 2010 while Ozzy was appearing on The Howard Stern Show to promote the book, Howard recounted a section early on in the book about how the members of Black Sabbath would send women up to Ozzy's hotel room while the band was out on the road. Howard said, \\"Man, that must have been cool to have all those women.\\" Ozzy said in his mumbled way, \\"No, that never happened. No one sent me women.\\" Howard said, \\"But Ozzy it's right here in your book. Have you read your own book?\\" Ozzy said quite simply, \\"No.\\" Laughter erupts in the studio. The guy really is crazy.y's limited ability to remember much due to his alcohol and drug abuse make this part of the book relatively and sadly too short. Nevertheless, it is a part of the book that is filled with classic, comical and of course one of the most tragic moments.<br /><br />The last third of the book is primarily devoted to Ozzy's rise to worldwide star-status through MTV's [[ASIN:B00005JLBW The Osbournes]], his continuing accounts of drug abuse and alcoholism, and his eventual road to a cleaner way of life. Unlike the first two-thirds of the book, little time or mention is made of the making of his subsequent records and how he recruited the personnel for his new band(s). I would have liked to have seen more on his road escapades with Zakk Wylde versus the amount of time he took to talk about the day to day filming of The Osbournes.<br /><br />Anyway, I Am Ozzy is a good, funny read and I'd recommend it to Ozzy fans and casual readers alike.

B000000H57|5.0|I just had to write having heard of the passing of Type O's Peter Steele. I'm in shock and dismay, and probably more upset by his death than any other artist in recent memory. A lot of that is due to this very album, the masterpiece called \\"October Rust\\". Since it's release in 1996, it has remained my Number One Favorite album of the last fourteen years. And I've heard a LOT of music over those years. This, their finest moment, transcends mere heavy-metal. Or hard rock. Or goth. Or alternative. It's all of those, but so much more. I can't think of any other album that still sends little shivers down my spine when I play it. The voice of the Man himself, the songwriting, the performances - it puts all other similar bands to shame. I still hear little bits and pieces in the background of these songs that I never heard before. And that's the beauty of this band. Being able to produce in his own studio meant Peter Steele could tinker and play with the songs for as long as he wanted. And he did. The results are an album that simply transports you into its own universe. Very little \\"metal\\" can ever be called beautiful, but this album is gothic beauty in spades. There's only a few bands I can think of who have created their own musical world - Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Cure and Depeche Mode come to my mind, and of course, Type O Negative. If you've heard all the R.I.P.s' and accolades over the last few days, and have never heard this album, do yourself a favor. Then try the rest, all masterpieces in their own right. But this was the zenith of Peter Steele's writing and producing abilities. A true genius has left us, and I am so sad. No more Type O albums?? Tears well up as I write. I feel like.....a death in the family.

B001TH7GT6|4.0|The reason I give this product only 4 of 5 stars is because they are not color coded as the \\"normal\\" short cables with which a DVD player, etc are colored.  These cables are green, red and blue as opposed to yellow, red and white.  Makes the installation slightly more tricky, but they work well and are nice and long, which was my main goal in purchasing them.

B000062XFG|2.0|Season 1 of this show was a travesty.  They took everything that was wrong with the original series and made a season of television based on that.  This season was only slightly better (some people would even say that this season is the worst).  Beverly Crusher is absent this season, and she is replaced with Dr. Pulaski, that annoying raspy-voiced harpy.  Her character alone was enough to bring the season down.  And she seems to have a pathological hatred for Data, demeaning him at every opportunity.    They start the season off with a Troi epsiode, which almost could have been percieved as a sign that is was going to be a bad season.  A thing about Troi inexplicably having a child, who grows to boyhood in a matter of days.  Then they followed it up with an episode about some wierd organism thing doing experiments on Enterprise and her crew.  Then the stupid Sherlock Holmes episode, which later led to the absolutely horrible \\"Ship in a Bottle\\" episode a few years later.  Then the absolutely horrible, awful, terrible \\"The Outrageous Okona\\".  Probably my least favorite episode of the entire series.  And I'm talking worse than \\"Hide and Q\\" or \\"Code of Honor.\\"  It's simply too painful for me to go into much of these episodes in detail.  There were some good ones, such as \\"A Matter of Honor\\", in which Riker has to serve aboard a Klingon ship as part of an officer exchange program.  It established the Klingons of TNG, and was a pretty decent episode.  The episode immediately following, \\"The Measure of a Man, is widely considered to be one of the best of the entire series.  Picard has to hold a hearing to determine whether Data is a sentient being, and if he has the right to refuse to be dismantled for research purposes.  Riker is forced to prosecute, which makes it even harder for Picard to win the case.  This episode was great, and it was very dramatic, even though there wasn't a single action scene.    Wow.  I'm already done.  That was a quick review.  As I said in my season 1 review, I am astonished that this series did not get cancelled in the first season.  It took until the third season to change into the great series that it would eventually be.  There is no way this show could have gotten good ratings in the beginning.  It was just so bad.  This season is a little bit better.  We are introduced to the Borg, possibly the scariest villians of Trek.  At least until they introduce the Borg Queen.  Then they became a joke.  To wrap up, this was a pretty bad season of Star Trek.  Once again, it tried to be too much like the original series, minus the beloved characters from that show.
0545123267|5.0|Found this book on Amazon and would have missed out without it. Love Amazon even more for it. Shiver was a great read and never did I once regret purchasing it. I would highly recommend reading it and have given to my friends and family to read. The story line is great and you get to hear both sides of the story and everything flows without any questions on what is going on. I am a werewolf addict and this book was a wonderful addition to my werewolf collection. I am on the edge of my seat waiting for linger. Can not wait for that. Love this book and love Amazon for giving me the chance to read it when I would have otherwise missed out on a wonderful story.     My only issue was that I read it way to fast. kinda wish it wasn't such a page turner so that I still would be reading it and not counting down the days until I get to read more about hunky Sam. : )

0061092037|2.0|I was very disappointed with the state of this book. It was in very poor condition and stained. I knew that it was second-hand but it was stated that it was in \\"good\\" condition.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Well I got this product and the first thing I wanted to test was how well it stacked up to my previous 5.1 surround sound system. I needed a quieter way to game while the girlfriend sleeps. I work a grave yard job, so im used to being up late and these seemed like the right choice so I could still enjoy having surround sound for games and movies.<br /><br />This is my small rating.<br />Sound- 5/5<br /><br />Battery Life- 5/5 ( 23+ hours for sure with decent settings, no bass ) ( but 4/5 if you have it maxed out with bass, seems only to come up to about 18 hours )<br /><br />Comfort- 4.5/5 Its all actually REALLY light, comfortable for hours of play and feels nice on my head, easily adjustable too. The only complaint is that every few hours or whenever needed, I need to just lower it to my neck to get some air to my ears lol. Its not bad, but they do get warm and \\"stuffy\\" but im sure this is with all headsets.<br /><br />One thing I want to point out is that I've been playing with the standard headset for every 360, you know which one. I've had a wireless one ( the official bluetooth thing ) before, but this beats it by far. All my friends said the could hear me SO much better. And I could hear them ALOT better too. The mic is so sensitive in fact, that I can litteraly whisper into it and my friends say it sounds like I'm talking as if I had the old headset on. And trust me, I'm whispering but to them its like normal, so when I'm talking normal its really loud and clear.<br /><br />One other thing is the chat boost function. I didnt really pay attention to it until after I was use to the headset and all the sound coming from it ( like in CoD ). What it does it adjust the chat volume w/ the game volume. You can adjust them seperatly untill you find your perfect medium. Want to hear your friends voices loud and clear? Want to get them to be perfectly even? Well you can find the right adjustment for you. Lol it took me a while to find the perfect spots I wanted. I had to have my friends talking like idiot for a day until found it. But once its set, its set. If one game is quieter than the other ( ie: borderlands vs mw2 ) then you just adjust the volume on the headset to the game, and the chat stays with it.<br />Now the chat boost. I was playing MW2 and there was a harrier flying about and an AC130 shooting the crap out of everyone. If you dont know how loud that stuff is.. its LOUD.. I mean when those shells are hitting around you, its like your really there. You dont really hear ( or pay attention ) to other sounds, like guns firing. But even how loud it starts getting there, you can hear your friends PERFECT. It auto adjusts your chat sound. So when this get crazy and loud, your not trying to fumble around with your chat volume so you can hear your friends. It is a very nice feature and it does it on its own and so smooth. Once the action calms down again, it adjust accordingly. VERY hand and very usefull... I LOVE that.<br /><br />The first things I wanted to test and find out were complaints others had, popping, static, malfunctioning mic, etc. So I've had them for over a month and use them EVERY day. I use them on average of 4-8 hours a day and possibly because I dont have the Bass Boost on ( it sounds good sometimes, but for most my games it isnt necessary ) and I keep it about medium volume. ( they can get REALLY loud ) I only have to change batteries every 5-7 days. So for me thats handy.<br /><br />Um, one thing I should mention is that they say they use the batteries to the full extent and give you full on sound untill its done. They do not lie! I can usually tell when its getting close to dying ( about another hour or so ) because there is a static and humming for like 3 seconds, but after the 3 its back to sounding great. I play mostly CoD MW2, BFBC2, and L4D2. To me its almost EXACTLY the same as my surround sound system I have.. the only thing is that you dont have a perfect sound direction when something is directly behind you. Sometimes it sounds a little to the left or right, but I read that this is with most headsets, no just Turtlebeach. But if you have a surround sound system, then these things, to me, are just as good if not better. Why? Because since its ALL in your EAR, I could really hear things alot better. I mean I blasted my surround sound, but to hear bullets whizzing by your head, glass shattering about you, even someones knife's swhoosh sound as it barely misses you... its simply amazing. I played alot of games and I just could not believe how much small sounds and detail I missed without these. To me thats a huge plus. I love being able to hear the little things in games, makes me appreciate the game and the developers for adding that amount of detail... not to mention saving my butt when playing online games.<br /><br /> Like I said there is pretty much ZERO warning before this thing shuts off. The sound never changes untill its dead. This to me is a good/bad thing. I like not having to hear a beep every so often and I like how the sound stays the exact same as if there brand new batteries, but if your in the middle of a game ( say search and destroy ) and your trying to tell your friend where the enemy is and all of a sudden it gets dead quiet... it sucks. But thankfully for me the batteries can be swapped out in a few seconds.<br /><br />Another small complaint is that everything is for, like, left handed people. The volume, power, bass, and mic are all on the left side. Now I'm at the point where I'm use to it, but it was much more difficult considering I'm horrible at left handed things.<br /><br />Ok now what about static, humming, all that stuff everyone complains about?<br />Well I can say that they arent lying, but they are stretching the truth.<br /><br />There is a small humming when you turn it on, IF there is no sound. This means if you 360 etc is not on or just starting up you will hear it but only then. If your in a game and its DEAD quiet, you still won't hear any humming.<br /><br />Static- I only experience it a couple times, and yes it was during gameeplay etc, but my modem is 3 feet or more away from the headsets modem. I also want to point out that it was mostly due to my Wii being on the Wii Connect 24, so it was ALWAYS getting a wireless signal. I turned that off and now maybe only 2x has it had static since then, but it was only for a few seconds then stopped.<br /><br />Popping- Yes this does happen. Its happend only once randomly and man it did kinda hurt my ears for sec. Its not bad but it is very noticible and it will wake you up lol. All the other times its happened was because I disconnected the cord from the controller and put it back in. As with ALL headsets, sometimes you need to unplug and replug once, or no one can hear you... Im sure all of you have had this happen with any headset.<br /><br />So other than ( to me ) a very small annoying things, this headset is GREAT. I love it. Im so glad I have it. Everything works fine, and I havent had any major problems. If your looking to buy a GREAT wireless headset with surround sound, good battery life, and can afford this, I would recommend this to anyone!ght, but I read that this is with most headsets, no just Turtlebeach.

B002EWD0I6|4.0|I waited a while before purchasing this series because I wasn't sure it would be family friendly enough. Then I saw enough reviews that sold me on it. There is alcohol use so be forewarned about that but there is no nudity, infidelity, improper use of the Lord's name I must add- so far.  We have only watched about half of the episodes.  It is just a delightful tale of the people of two towns that are as different as night and day.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the series called Cranford.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|The most corniest stupiest movie I ever did see. I do not mind stories like these about devotion but this is over the top in the sense of B..O..R..I..N..G!!Richard Geer isnt getting any better offers these days??
0393072231|5.0|I knew this was going to be a good book when it actually made me laugh. How many books on the economy can boast that? If you want an understanding of what happened to the market during the great recession look no further.  Lewis does a great job of explaining the difference between a CDO and a CDS and he does it in a way that is entertaining.  This book is hard to put down once you start to to read it. The people involved are described to perfection. I had no idea how all this started and very little idea how all the players were responsible until reading this book. Now I can't believe how this story unfolded without someone putting a stop to it.
B002NXQ0X8|5.0|Pete Yorn is my favorite, and I wasn't surpised how good this one was. Scarlett is actually a really good singer! I got this album last year and listen to it almost everyday, it's so addicting! I love all the songs but the ones I always have on repeat are: I Don't Know What To Do, Search Your Heart, Blackie's Dead, and Shampoo.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|So I initially bought this headset because my wife was complaining that the volume was too loud on the system while she was trying to sleep at night.  After many discussions in which I mentioned that sound was integral (rather than incidental) to many games, I began looking for a decent headset which could serve my needs.  This headset is excellent for keeping the noise where it belongs--right in your ears.  My wife has mentioned how she can't even hear the noise from the headset when she's right next to me, which I take as a hearty endorsement.      I've tried this headset on Xbox 360, PS3 and my computer, and it works very well on all of them.  But in the previous statement lies part of the problem.  I own *all* of these systems.  Switching between the computer and one of the consoles is very easy.  Switching between the consoles themselves has been slightly more problematic.  If you own only one of the consoles, you won't have any of these issues, but owning them both has caused me to do a bit of head-scratching to get it all working properly.  If you have both consoles, chances are that you will have them connected through different inputs, such as two different HDMI ports, one component and one HDMI, etc.  Because the headset uses a piggyback cable to tap into the audio of *one* of these consoles, you'll probably have to choose one or the other, come up with a workaround solution like I did, or be forced to constantly swap audio cables around the back of your TV.  That's why I say this headset is great, but not perfect.    I don't buy expensive components, but I must say that this headset is well worth the money.  If you're looking for a good product for your first major headset purchase, I would highly recommend this one.
B002VECM6S|5.0|It is a great movie.  Much better than most of what is put out in the 21st century.  Recommended highly.

B0036EBARO|4.0|I bought this album last week immediately upon seeing it on Amazon; read no reviews, comments, etc... I'm Goldfrapp fan and it was a new album, click-buy - simple as that.  And I'm so glad I did; I love it!    As with many reviews here (I have read a few now out of curiosity) the first thing that jumped out was how much of an \\"80s\\" sound it has, which is OK with me. Still modern electro but with a blatant throwback to some 80's pop.  I've always been more into Black Cherry and Supernature than Felt Mountain and Seventh Tree (what a surprise with that one..), so the sound of this album was definitely more of what I hoping for.  Yeah, it's a little pop'y, but not terribly.  The darker tracks \\"Dreaming\\" and \\"Hunt\\" are fantastic though...     Bottom line, it was absolutely worth buying and I would do it again without a blink!
B002QEXN2K|4.0|How does one follow up a masterpiece?    Not many artists have to answer that question at some point in their careers.  John Mayer got that chance with his 2009 LP, 'Battle Studies.'  It's an enviable position to be in, but an extremely difficult one too.    Make no mistake, Mayer's 2007 offering 'Continuum' was a masterpiece.  It perfectly blended his pop-rock roots with the blues chops he established during his time fronting the John Mayer Trio.  Every song seemed meticulously crafted and refined, each one a joy to listen to.    'Battle Studies' is a decidedly different album.  It lacks the consistency of 'Continuum', but its standouts can easily stand up to the best tracks Mayer has ever released.    The album leads off with \\"Heartbreak Warfare,\\" arguably its best and most memorable track.  The song is a rollicking, echoey ballad that establishes the underlying theme of 'Battle Studies': love as war.  It's a beautiful, catchy song that you'll want to listen to again and again.    The rest of the album pulls some sudden switches between 80s-esque electric rock (think Eric Clapton or Tom Petty) and folksy acoustic guitar.  \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\" allows Mayer to exercise his vocal talent, which seems to effectively split audiences.  Love it or hate it, the guy can belt it, and there's no denying his unequaled talent on the guitar.    The only collaboration on the album is \\"Half Of My Heart,\\" which features Taylor Swift (I guess).  She's barely there, but hearing her very short solo is a neat addition to the bare, acoustic-and-drumset-laden song.    \\"Who Says\\" was a controversial choice for the first single released on the album.  There are tracks on 'Battle Studies' with much bigger hit potential, but \\"Who Says\\" is a quiet, honest, acoustic musing by Mayer, who lyrically wonders who says he can't do what he wants to do.    \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" is a bluesy tune, upbeat with some more signature guitar thrown in for good measure.  Aside from the warfare theme, this album definitely fits into another concept: singleness.  Both \\"Who Says\\" and \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" fit this theme.  They're frank expressions of Mayer's contentment with the single life.    \\"Assassin\\" deserves a special mention.  It's one of the strangest and most unique tracks Mayer has ever put out.  It constantly fluctuates between quiet and loud, and the sound is something you'll have to hear for yourself.  It's tough to describe, but I definitely like it.    Mayer covers Clapton/Cream on \\"Crossroads,\\" which is cool to hear but not all that memorable.  That guitar is pretty damn impressive, though.    \\"Edge of Desire\\" is my other favorite on the album.  It's a slow song, and the chorus is extremely beautiful.  It's a perfect showcase of the honest pictures of romance that Mayer is known for.    \\"Do You Know Me\\" is definitely the most forgettable track on the album.  It clocks in at 2.5 minutes, and it's easy to let it pass by without even noticing its presence on 'Battle Studies'.  It's extremely slow and bare, which isn't bad, but it doesn't stand out as much as the other tracks do.    'Battle Studies' finishes out with \\"Friends, Lovers Or Nothing,\\" which I definitely appreciate because it's piano-driven.  My favorite track on 'Continuum' was unquestionably 'Dreaming With A Broken Heart', which is very similar to \\"Friends, Lovers Or Nothing\\" in a lot of ways, including the sweet piano.  The guitar melds with the piano very well, and Mayer's writing is still topnotch.    Mayer had his work cut out for him when he was tasked with following up 'Continuum'.  He doesn't top that album here, but I get the feeling he wasn't exactly trying to.  He wanted to make some good music, and that's what he's accomplished here.  Even if it doesn't top 'Continuum', 'Battle Studies' does feature some of the best tracks Mayer has ever played.      Give 'Battle Studies' a preview listen before you buy, and you'll see what I mean.  I can almost guarantee that \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" will convince you in a heartbeat that 'Battle Studies' is worth your money.  Just remember to give the rest of the album a little time to grow on you.  You won't regret it.
B000001G5H|5.0|I love Chopin's Etudes, and Pollini's interpretation is my favorite - passionate and virtuoso. While some others play them like robotic finger exercises, he embedded passions and vitality into the performance, creating a vivid and vivacious movie as you listen to each masterpiece.    Op.10 No.3 \\"Tristesse\\" - I had to agree with other users' review that the accelerations in tempo in the second theme was a little too excessive.  Maybe his interpretation is to show the excruciation by furiousness arose from the melancholy? Although we can't find a unity of this piece from all the artists who have recorded this, I prefer Stanislav Bunin's version.     Op.25 No.1 \\"Aeolian Harp\\" - Pollini brings out the beautiful harp-like sound with the rapid arpeggios. He plays it a little quicker than others, but his arpeggios are crisper. It is elegantly played.     Op.25 No.5 - some romanticized it as \\"wronged notes\\", this piece begins with a series of semitones like katzenjammer and suddenly transitions to a fairy-tale like, harmonious melody.  Pollini made a smooth conversion of these distinctive 2 sections and presents them like one goes through the vicissitudes of life.    Op.25 No.12 \\"Ocean\\" - Pollini's version is my favorite. While others play this piece like ripples, he emphasizes more force and makes it like treacherous waves.
0316069906|5.0|I cannot express the effect this book had on my life.  It speaks the truth regarding the production of meat in the United States and most of the world.  It is not a book with page after page of horror stories.  Well written and concise; it has changed my life and is sure to change yours.  This book should be required reading 5th grade and up.  Do your friends and the dear animals that suffer for our meals a great justice...purchase this book and share with friends, family and co-workers.
B002P6TA94|5.0|I have yet to hear anything from Wolfmother that has disappointed me. They've got good, strong song structure, very insightful lyrics and catchy riffs. I enjoy both CDs from Cosmic Egg but can't understand why there was a single CD version of this album. It flows very nicely as a two disc and I can't understand why they would want to remove any of these songs. I recommend getting the two disc because you're not getting your moneys worth with the single disc version, in my opinion.
0439023483|4.0|I like young adult books. I've always preferred story and character to fancy wordplay and ambiguous symbolism, so books like the Harry Potter series can be the perfect fit. When my friend recommended The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, though, I was a bit nervous due to her love for The Twilight Series. We share very similar tastes except for that large exception. I read some reviews, did my usual research, and decided to give the book a chance.    I'm very glad I did. The Hunger Games is a satisfying start to what promises to be an exciting series. Is it a surefire classic? Not quite, but it certainly is memorable. The novel's premise isn't new: the protagonist is thrust into a life or death reality show/event set by a corrupt government. Being a big Stephen King fan, I've explored this territory before with The Running Man. In this case, it's Katniss Everdeen, a teenage civilian in the poorest district of the nation, and the Hunger Games is the show. In order to survive, she must outwit and kill twenty-three other teenagers. The crux of this book becomes surviving all of the brutality while at the same time retaining one's humanity. Not your typical young adult fare.    That's really what separates The Hunger Games from everything else - tone. The are multiple deaths, self-sacrifice, and mutilations in the book, ensuring that readers under the age of thirteen shouldn't tackle this novel. Some may consider the gruesome parts unnecessary, I see it as Collins respecting her readership. Young adults don't need to be coddled, they can stomach morbid details, as well as deal with heavier themes. Katniss questions the morality of her government, her peers, and herself, and so should the readers.    One minor complaint I have is that everything seems to fall into the lap of Katniss when she desperately needs help. I mean, things literally appear out of thin air to aid her. Sure, there's a logical explanation for this - contestants each have sponsors who can send them gifts during the Game - but it made things too predictable. Every time Katniss found herself in a sticky situation, I would think to myself \\"don't worry, help is certainly just around the corner\\". It would've been nice, and more realistic, if she had had ongoing issues that forced her to adapt and evolve rather than simply wait.    Still, I found the book's ending to be excellent, and I can't wait to start its sequel, Catching Fire. It feels as if the story is just about to open up. It's also worth mentioning that Collins writes excellent characters. Katniss is one of the absolute best and most believable female protagonists that I've ever read. Collins partly achieves this through the use of the first-person point-of-view, a perspective I'm not normally a fan of, and she pulls it off excellently.    The Hunger Games is a fast-paced thriller that never really lets up. And just enough information is given about the history of the nation, the Capitol, and the Games to make you hunger for more. If Catching the Fire and Mockingjay (the third book in the trilogy) deliver on everything promised in The Hunger Games, then the series could very well end up being a classic.
006621131X|5.0|Poet, singer-song writer, and visual artist.  Patti Smith's well written semi autobiographical memoirs of her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe was a privilege to read.  I read through the entire book absorbed in every detail of her casual and famous encounters like a deer in headlights, utterly in awe of her prose and ability to put pen to paper.  A truly fascinating and compelling read.
0141316047|5.0|Read the full review (with illustrations) on Sparkling Adventures: [...]    I thought that I would be presenting an anomaly for this month's DFF book club -- a book that we didn't actually own. However, just yesterday I finally obtained a fair secondhand copy at a garage sale, and now I can present to you a new favourite from our shelves.    Just because a book is made into a movie doesn't mean that the book is made redundant. How many times have you come away from a film saying, \\"The book was better\\"?    Charlotte's Web is one of those books. Don't spoil it by showing the movie to your kids. Read them the book instead, and then let them read the book too.    In reading this to my girls, there were several specific things that reminded me why Charlotte's Web is exceptional. The novel contains a nice range of characters with different personalities and voices. This makes it a lot of fun to read aloud (if you like \\"doing\\" voices), and there weren't too many to complicate things.    I found it helpful to read the dialogue in which Charlotte would explain real words to Wilbur the pig. This saved me the trouble of explaining the new vocabulary to the girls. These little lessons were woven into the story so neatly.    I also liked the educational aspect of the book. The kids heard about how a farm works, learned about the life cycle of a spider and the truth about what happens to those cute animals on the farm.    This book introduces some dark themes without going overboard -- death, grief, loss -- as well as the more positive themes of maturity (Fern growing interested in boys), friendship and loyalty. We don't eat pork much, so I'm not sure if Charlotte's Web would put your children off their meat, but mine weren't affected.    We got this book out of the library. Our version contained a bit of colour in the original illustrations, which added to its charm. Charlotte's Web is a good introduction to chapter books for children aged five and over. (I managed to keep Brioni at my side, but only just!)    There's a reason it's a classic, and that reason is why you should have it on your shelves too.

B000T00PE2|5.0|For a lot of Trip-Hop and Electronic artists I am wary of purchasing their albums because there is a great deal of them who make one or two good songs on an album and the rest are repetitive beats and/or god-awful. It is not the case with this album, each single is just that - a single. The tone of the album is rich and deep with a heavy bass but not so much that it eliminates mid and high range sounds. Each song stands on its own and makes the purchase of the CD worth it. I don't have many albums where I can go without skipping any songs, but this is one. It is extraordinary listen and is an album that will remain significant many years from now.

Unfortunately, if you've read any arfticles on it, the book has nothing useful to say beyond that.

I had hoped to come away with something useful that I could apply.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|So, this week I had to say goodbye to a very good friend.  Ugly Betty, we (ALL your fans) will REALLY miss you. I definitely plan on buying all the seasons, maybe starting from the first one and working my way through it again.  My one hope is that if enough people buy these seasons the ABC execs or some other station will bring back Ugly Betty.  (Hey, it happened to Family Guy!!)   This was a very good show that never failed to make me laugh or get drawn into the characters dilemmas.  And how will I survive without Mark and Amanda, the best sidekicks ever?!?!?  What a great set of characters and great actors to portray them.  Not to mention the fantastic writers of the show who brought it all together!  If you are looking for a show that guys and girls can get into, this is your pick.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed!
0393072231|5.0|This book was both timely and informative.  Given the ongoing economic crisis we face, this book increased my understanding of how Wall Street works in general and specifically how the sub prime mortgage market  and credit default swaps worked.  Given this information, it's not surprising that Goldman Sachs was recently charged with Civil Fraud by the SEC.  As I read the book my reaction was their behavior was unethical to say the least.  Great book that I highly recommend.

B0036B8MXC|5.0|As far as cable series go I would have to say that Spartacus: Blood and Sand is at least tied with The Sopranos as my personal favorite.  I have limited knowledge since I don't watch a lot of cable series, but I am a veteran of The Sopranos, Oz and Deadwood, so I have watched every episode of some of the best.     Anyway, the first few episodes were good enough to keep me watching.  And once things really got going I was addicted.    During the last half of the first season every show is comparable to the episode of The Sopranos were they killed Big Pussy.  The only difference is that with Spartacus it is usually a complete surprise, whereas everyone pretty much knew Big Pussy was going to get killed at some point.  So maybe the episode of The Sopranos where Ralph Cifaretto was killed would be a better example, since that was more of an unexpected end to a main character.    And the last episode of the first season was probably the best series finale I have ever seen.  But it's not even the final episode of the series.  Apparently there is at least one more entire season left, and the writers may have backed themselves against a wall with this one.  There are going to be some serious expectations for an equally exciting second season, but the first season could easily stand alone.    Basically, the writers do an excellent job at unexpected plot changes and character development.  You end up really liking a lot of the characters, and really disliking a lot of the other characters.  Then an episode comes along where one of those characters is killed, or their lives are at least changed drastically.  The next episode the same thing happens to 2 or 3 of the characters, and the episode after that it happens to 5 or 10 characters.  So one of the most impressive things is how fast the characters are developed, and how fast the plots change.     I think it's safe to say that a majority of people that are into fantasy fiction would really like this series.  But I also thinkit would appeal to many others as well.
B000063UR2|4.0|I watched a recorded VHS version of the Theatrical release growing up many times... so much so that the VHS tape wore out.  I was thrilled to get this copy of the film, but was a little put off when I watched the director's cut.  The soundtrack is completely different, which in turn, changes the way you view this movie.  If this is your first time watching this film, please watch the Theatrical version first.  The director's cut does little except give you a few extra hints about the storyline you may have missed in the Theatrical version.      Overall - 4 stars.  I recommend fantasy lovers to purchase this copy!
0143039504|5.0|This book will take me a very long time to read; the print is a lot smaller than I would have liked.  I have seen most of these stories as movies, so it will be interesting to see how the book is different.
0064407667|2.0|I saw the movie before reading this book and I believe this is one of the rare instances of the movie being better than the book it was based on. The Bad Beginning tries to be both scary and educational at the same time. Many words was defined instead of allowing readers to deduce the meaning through the context used or just plain using easier works. It was annoying and read like almost like a dictionary in places.<br /><br />The story itself was bizarre. Every adult character was either stupid, mean or a combination of the two. The overly intelligent children manage to save themselves through exploiting a technicality that was completely unrealistic and shouldn't have been effective. The overtly predatory Count Olaf made me fear for the children's lives, their money and especially for Violet's virtue. I repeatedly got the feeling he had the unseemly plan to consummate his impending relationship with her.<br /><br />I realize that my objections to this book are probably the work of an warped adult mind reading things into the context of the story, but nothing about this book was enjoyable. I will not be continuing this series.

B0037W68F4|4.0|I tried, tried, tried to jump on the bandwagon and like the previous CD (Oracular Spectacular) but I just kept skipping over it on the iPod (and the vocals annoyed the hell out of me).  Gave this second one a try because 1) I was still trying to figure out what all the fuss was about and 2) I loved the cover art of the CD (I'm a CD snob - love the packaging - you miss out on so much by dowloading music).  This 2nd CD is great.  I loved the harmonies, the symphonic sound, the bliping and bleeping trippiness and yes, in my opinion, this CD is very different from O.S., and this makes it all the better.  In an interview with Rolling Stone MGMT tell the muisc magazine they weren't ready for the attention and recognition they received from their O.S. and decided to go back to what they were used to and wanted to be/sound like (prooving that once again O.S. was simply the record industry's say on what MGMT should sound like and put out there).  They say this 2nd CD is more them and I'm liking that better.
B002NFCHBA|3.0|Chopin lovers have certainly no trouble spending their money this year. On the 150th anniversary of his death in 1999, DG released a complete Chopin edition entitled '[[ASIN:B00001X58Z The Man and His Music]]'. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth, the 17-disc set has now been repackaged and somewhat modified--as well as significantly reduced in price.<br /><br />The main changes are the near-exclusion of Jean-Marc Luisada's contributions, which were recorded especially for the 1999 edition; the Waltzes and Mazurkas have instead been filled by Ashkenazy's three-decade old Decca recordings, which does constitute an improvement. The movement of the Nocturnes moved from Barenboim to Pires is an improvement as well--but the real highlight here is the upgrade in Zimerman's Concertos; his poised but understated 1979/1980 accounts have been replaced with his extraordinarily deeply felt 1999 remakes with himself conducting.<br /><br />Regrettably, Argerich's blazing Preludes have given way to Blechacz's comparatively cautious account, whereas Li has replaced Bunin in the Impromptus. Worse, though, Pollini still retains the largest proportion in the form of the Etudes, Scherzos, mature Polonaises, Second and Third Sonatas, as well as the Berceuse and Barcarolle. Certain quarters keep lauding Pollini's Chopin, which was considered novel in the postmodernist 1960s for its cleanliness and technical perfection, but has become largely outdated due to its near-complete lack of sensitivity and emotional impact. The Universal Classics back catalogue contains far preferable versions of all these works--Magaloff or Ashkenazy in the Etudes, Pogorelich in the Scherzos, Harasiewicz or Ashkenazy in the Polonaises, Pogorelich or Argerich in the Sonatas, as well as Ashkenazy or Pires in the Berceuse and Zimerman or Argerich in the Barcarolle.<br /><br />Against this background, there is not much greatness to be found in this complete Chopin compilation; only Zimerman's Concertos and Ballades, Ashkenazy's Waltzes and Argerich's marginalised contributions (Opp 3, 22 & 65) would qualify. Not even the price below $50 is all that attractive when [[ASIN:B002UCDVAC EMI's competing offer]], on balance about equal in quality, only costs just about half as much in Europe. Nonetheless, at only a few bucks more on the UK market, Ohlsson's reference survey reissued by Hyperion remains by far the most desirable treasure in this Chopin year.<br /><br />REFERENCE: [[ASIN:B001F4YGUA Ohlsson]]y's Waltzes and Argerich's marginalised contributions (Opp 3, 22 & 65) would qualify.

1416583408|4.0|Author Alexandra Horowitz is a psychology professor at Columbia University.  She's made her life's work studying behavior, often of various research animals.  She's also a dog owner and lover, and early on posits the question: we study all sorts of animals primarily mice and rats because they are cheap and easy to study, and primates, because they can give us insights into human behaviors.  Why, then, do we spend relatively scant time studying the animals about which we think we know the most; our companion animals, in this case the dog.<br /><br />Horowitz decided to study this most remarkable animal by videotaping hundreds of hours of dogs interacting in dog parks.  She has deciphered many canine signals, the play bow, signs one dog wants to break off play, body movements that show a dog will want to resume playing, and so on.<br /><br />One of the things she points out that should be obvious, is that dogs see the world from a lower perspective than humans do.  They have four legs, so they run, lope and walk differently than humans, and they get most of their understanding of the world from their olfactory sense.  We're visually-oriented creatures; dogs are olfactory-oriented creatures.  Makes a huge difference.  She also points out that as a species, dogs have the largest variability of all animals.  She also points out that though all dogs are descended from the gray wolf, if you just left dogs to themselves, they will never breed themselves back to the wolf.  Domestication apparently has made the changes in the wolf irreversible.<br /><br />Will this book change the way you understand your dog, how he thinks and behaves?  Yes, it does.  Will it give you insights as to various dog behaviors that you might not have realized?  Yes.  Does it give dog training tips and hints?  Yes, to some degree.  Does it answer the question, what is smarter, a dog or your two-year-old nephew?  Yes. Your average two-year-old is quite slow in development than your average dog.<br /><br />I liked the book.  It's easy to read, and unlike the dry, complex writing you'd expect to find if this study appeared in a scientific journal.

0553381687|5.0|I have seen this series for sometime on the shelves of various bookstores and have read some reviews online, but keep on putting off reading any of his work for some unknown reason.  He is labeled one of America's best fiction fantasy writers and after reading this book, I would have to agree.  This man is a damn good author and the versatility of skills he places into this book, either its characterization, plot construction and expansion, philosophy, or pretty much anything, he nails it with perfection almost every time. As far as the world that he created, it seems almost real, like reading a medieval history book and actually jumping back in to time it felt so realistic.  If your looking for stereotypical fantasy in this book, you might want to put it down. If you like plot intrigue, war, political, a realistic world and realistic characters that are not invincible; this book is must for you.  Combine all those and have it written almost flawlessly and you have A Game of Thrones.  Regardless if you like fantasy or not, this is just a real good book to sit down and read.  I'd recommend this to.......everyone.
B002APU580|2.0|The 1995 version of this movie with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehrle was the most beautiful production, filmed b ythe BBC and shown on the A&E channel. The scenery was luscious, the acting was convincing, and the period of the drama seemed more authentic than this version. Also the cinamentographer had breathtaking views. Also, this 1995 version is light, breezy, and easy comedic drama. I believe this is the movie catapulted Colin Firth's career.  For me, he will always be \\"the\\" Mr. Darcy.    Now, regarding this 2005 remake, for the film has been remade many times, it was a very drab. I love Keira Knightly, and I thought Brenda Bleven played her part well; however, Allison Steadman, who played the mother in the 1995 version, was very irritating but funny too. I didn't like Donald Sutherland portrayal as the father. To me, he seemed somewhat aloof as the father. Of all the sisters, Jena Malone, who portrayed Lydia, was the most miscast as was the actor who played Mr. Collins. If you get the 1995 version, watch how David Bammer who played this role just makes you laugh at his portrayal of this character. In my opinion, the main fault of this movie, along with the casting, should not have been squeezed into two hours. The 1995 version, on two discs, was just over 5 hours.     Andrew Davies, the British screenwriter, really caught the nuance of Jane Austin's book. I'm sure this is the movie that help catapult Colin Firth's film career. In my opinion, he's never had a better role even although he's gone on to have been nominated as Best Actor for \\"A Single Man\\", then later won the Oscar for his role in \\"The King's Speech.\\"  So, please, please see the 1995 A&E version with Colin Firth, please see it. It is a wonderfully made.
B000W74EQC|4.0|THIS REVIEW WILL ONLY BE BASED ON THE MOVIE, AND ITS RELATION TO THE NOVEL.    So this is the beginning, isn't it?  JK Rowling's incredible world of magic, that started in 1998 in America started on the movie screen in 2001.  So how good was this movie?  It was definitely very good.  Quite roughly it's about a boy who nearly died by the most dangerous dark wizard to ever step foot in the world, and ends up living with a muggle family related to his mother who treat him like an outcast and a bad seed, feeling disgraced and embarrassed that any family member could be magical.  But Harry receives a letter to go to one of the best magic schools, called Hogwarts, and he begins to learn about his unavoidable wizard heritage.        You have to start with the acting, because starting with this film for the series, there has been a healthy mix of young new talent, and veteran talent throughout, and this film is no different.  The whole cast is virtually British with a few Irish exceptions.  You have Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris as McGonagall, Snape, and Dumbledore respectively anchoring the wonderful young talents of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy).  The acting is simply great in my opinion, considering they were enlisting child talent throughout the country.        The important part of a film adaptation of a novel is bringing forward the spirit the novel creates.  The nice thing is that Sorcerer's Stone is the shortest of all the Harry Potters, so it makes it relatively easy to stay faithful with a 2 hour 20 minute film.  Chris Columbus and his people did a great job of this.  Nearly all of the important pieces are there for the adaptation to make sense, and for all the pieces to fit together as well as they did in the novel.      Now, Harry Potter is obviously geared to young adults, so why should someone in their 20s or 30s get into Harry Potter?  First off, thefilm IS visually stimulating.  The special effects aren't overdone, nor is it the focus, but it's done perfectly to give what it has to give to the film.  Also, the children playing the roles really bring out what these characters are all about in the novel, as do the adult cast.  Their personalities are effectively evoked through their incredible performances, and although the concept of magic spells and high fantasy are more indicative of your stereotypical middle school nerd, it has a lot to offer about adolescence and self-doubt, even at the tender age of 11.  Perhaps JK Rowling didn't envision her saga would reach the adult demographic, but it did, and that's kind of what makes these stories amazing.      So what was great about this film for it to deserve 4 out of 5 stars?  The acting was phenomenal, but the important thing when a series such as Harry Potter has so much popular culture buzz is to stay faithful so the bookworms can respect it, but so newbies can get into it and follow the films much like people would follow the novels, and Sorcerer's Stone definitely achieves this effectively.  The special effects were great when they were necessary, and the character introductions were well-played.  Enough things were changed around, such as the order of things, and certain settings, but the important parts were there, and the actions that occurred were evoked, even though something may have taken place on Hogwarts footsteps, as opposed to the Hogwarts train as it was in the novel (Harry's first confrontation with Malfoy, for example).      What was negative for the film to not deserve five stars?  Well, it was what it was.  Most introductory novels to a fantasy series has to spend a significant amount of time introducing the characters and future plotlines, and Sorcerer's Stone is really no different.  The film isn't all that exciting, and there really isn't a ton of action.  I found the ending a little bit anti-climactic, although the twist was rather nice,but it really wasn't a battle.  Given what would go forward with the series, but if one was grading this movie in and of itself, it is a bit of an anti-climactic end.  There was also one omittance that was a bit irritating whichy was the end sequence (SPOILER ALERT) when Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the chamber to retrieve the Sorcerer's Stone before Professor Snape does (or so they believed anyway).  You had the Devil's Snare, the Flying Keys, and the Chess Match.  The film omitted the logic puzzle that Hermione figures out which is why in the novel she gets Gryffendor bonus points.  In the film she gets them through figuring out the Devil's Snare.  I wasn't really sure why this was omitted, probably for action continuity, but, I would have liked to have seen Hermione be her brainiac self for that portion.      All-in-all, for introductory purposes, and its ability to ensnare filmgoers into coming to the movie theater to see the next segment, it succeeds admirably.  There really is nothing wrong with the film at all, but the four out of five stars comes down to taste, and as most of us know, soon the series begins to take a darker tone, which is when it really finds its stride.  But JK Rowling really does create a great world with this story, and the film more or less does a very good job in being able to evoke her incredible vision.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|*IF* you already love this album, and the cost isn't going to stop you eating... buy this.  The remix/re-mastering is excellent.  I loved this album and this is a total refresh for me.  Sounds wonderful.    Is the book / DVD worth the money...?  I don't know.  I've read most of the book which was interesting.  Not watched the DVD yet.  Packaging is nice.    I don't know how else to buy the remixed album (I got this box set for $28 on an Amazon 'today's deals' and feel that for the money the remix was worth it.  However, $28 isn't much money to me (sorry - don't know how else to put it)).
0307454541|4.0|An engrossing mystery set in 2003, with an eye looking back at the 1960's.  With this time period, Larsson is able to use current technology as well as old fashioned sleuthing methods to bring the reader along in this twisted, and I do mean twisted, tale.  The main characters are flawed, but likable, and the ending seems plausible, with plenty of turns along the way.  Though not all the questions are answered at the end, and we are left wondering what will happen to our two main characters, the book is very satisfying and should keep your mind swimming as you try to figure who done it.  Be warned that the subject matter is very disturbing.

B000056NX5|4.0|This is a wonderful version with very powerful imagery and actors with exceptional voices. This contemporary version of the Gospel of Matthew really uses the scenery and costumes to bring to life all of the passion, both good and bad of mankind. I think this is a wonderful version to share with teens and adults will really appreciate all of the nuances perhaps lost on younger folk. The use of Gestapo and Roman soldier garb combined really allows the viewer to appreciate how oppressed a conquered people feel. The personal struggle of Pilot, real or imagined is amazing and Jesus, Judas and Mary Magdalene are powerful performances. The scenery and satire do not over power the wonderful message of this film. It is excellent.
045122499X|5.0|While reading Pillars of the Earth, I saw there was a sequel and couldn't wait to read it.  I wasn't disappointed.  This book dealt with many main characters and their twisted lives entangled in great medevil historical information.  Wish there were more books to read.
193413712X|5.0|Even here in Miami Beach in mid-April I found myself shuddering occasionally as I slowly moved through this remarkable small book, mine not yet identified as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize in Literature. A man is dying, his last hours ticking away in a hospital bed in the dining room of a house filled with clocks, for he has tinkered on them during his long life. He sees the world around him collapsing upon itself, the tiles of his life as meaningless, at least to future generations. And as he lies there, his kidneys almost functionless, he thinks about his father, an epileptic who was a door-to-door salesman in a fictional West Cove, Maine. The cover of this book is just so perfect: the life of the Crosby family is a bleak as is that part of the world in winter.<br />This may be a difficult book for some readers to get into because for a while one is provide with a richness of language that is not often found in current literature, as rich as the language of another novel set in Maine and also a Pulitzer winner, Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth Strout. What is it about Maine that gets all these Pulitzer novels? Before that Richard Russo's Empire Falls.<br />Paul Harding's artistry allows readers into the minds of its characters. George's mother wishes she could kill herself, an impoverished woman with four children, an epileptic husband, and isolated in this tragic setting. But the lake is too frozen for her to chop the hole that would allow her to drown. The reader shivers as he reads what she is thinking. And this is only one small piece of the mastery of Harding's language. And as I read this novel I thought about my maternal grandparents who lived atop a small mountain in northern Vermont living without electricity until their fiftieth wedding anniversary in the early fifties. My grandmother was as hard on her children as George's mother was on him and his siblings. But Harding helps one to get into the skin of women like that. This is incredible prose.<br />There is just something about Maine apparently. We should all be watching new novels coming out of there.t something about Maine apparently. We should all be watching new novels coming out of there.
B001MRMRS8|4.0|An opera friend calls this sort of production \\"Eurotrash\\".  It certainly was a detraction and did not make any sense to me.  Nevertheless, the singing is so good and Netrebko so \\"hot\\", its worth owning.
B00012BSHG|5.0|I bought this pool to use for my homebirth and I was very happy with it. It is comparable depth to other 'fishy pools' available from waterbirth suppliers, and of comparable price but with amazons free shipping of course it was a bargain! Fishy pools in general are not as deep as name brand birth pools, and I did find that I wished I had 4-6 more inches of depth when I was kneeling up, however I had someone to pour the warm water on my back and it worked out fine.  I hadn't been sure about the 'star' shape (As opposed to a regular oval or circle) but I actually really liked it because I had 'corners' to sit against and it gave me great back support when I leaned on it.   One thing to be aware of--the sides are clear--you can see right into the pool from anywhere in the room. Initially I thought that might be awkward because it didn't afford any extra privacy, but it ended up being no big deal when I was actually in labor.  My baby was born in this pool and hopefully my next one will be too. Five stars to amazon and this pool!!
B003405MF6|5.0|I have been listening to Jeff Beck since the 60's. There have been some great albums in those years. This is the best since Blow by Blow. That was thirty five years ago. I heard a reviewer say that wine and classic guitarists get better with age. This album is a testament to that conclusion. This is the best album I have bought in years.
B00004Y6NT|4.0|Fans of Mark Knopfler's classic Dire Straits mix of distinctive guitar work and mellow vocals will enjoy this CD.  I can never get enough of the band's unique sound, but I somehow missed this album when it came out.  I'll admit that after awhile, some of the songs begin to sound alike, but that doesn't bother me.  If you prefer a lot of variety, dramatic tempo changes, and a more variable vocal style on an album, this may not be your music.

B002VJ0576|1.0|This is a knock-off of the recent Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes with Guy Ritchie. Be warned - this is B-movie material. Bad effects, corny acting, etc. It seems a lot of people have confused the two. It's really a shame the producers of this film would stoop so low.
0765322889|2.0|I tried reading Steven Erikson's Gardens of the Moon, book one of the Malazan, Book of the Fallen series, three times before I finally managed to complete it. I can safely say that my initial inclinations were correct - I was better off not finishing it. Opinion is clearly strongly divided on Gardens of the Moon, so remember that this is just one opinion and your results may vary.    Before I proceed with my criticisms of the work, I have to give credit where it is due. Erikson has created a very thorough, very complex world. That sort of world building is admirable and adds a lot of depth to the work. This is a massive world with a seemingly endless array of characters. The time and effort Erikson put into creating that world must have been enormous.    Further, Erikson has a very strong vocabulary, particularly for a fantasy writer. Although his diction sometimes gets him in trouble (some of his sentences seem to be so bogged down in using large, fancy words that they don't seem to mean much of anything), I definitely appreciate an author who can write in an intelligent matter. On another technical point, Erikson can turn some very pretty phrases. Some of his descriptions are eloquent and beautifully written.    Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives. So on to the negatives.    My biggest complaint is with the characters. I don't mind a large quantity of characters. Nor do I mind the introduction of a character that disappears for great lengths. I do, however, take exception to dull, lifeless, two dimensional characters. Very few of the characters had anything special about them (I mean from a personality perspective, not a character trait perspective). The vast majority of the characters had basically the same personality - gritty, determined, worn out, but willing to do whatever is necessary to carry out their tasks. Ganoes Paran, Whiskeyjack, any of the Bridgeburners, actually, all basically act the same way. If you remove character background character motivation, there would be absolutely nothing to distinguish these characters. My interest was mildly piqued by Ganoes Paran and Tattersail but, again, only mildly so. For most of the characters, I didn't really care whether they lived or died.    Unlike the characters, the plot certainly has depth. But that's about all it has. In my opinion, a good book makes you care not only about the characters but also about the world and what happens to it. But I never cared. I didn't care if the Empire would manage to seize Pale. I didn't care if it would manage to seize Darujhistan. The Internal Revenue Code is almost as interesting as Gardens of the Moon. Rarely have I ever encountered a book about which I've cared less. I've read hundreds of books, including novels, historical works, philosophical treatises (and most of the Internal Revenue Code) and I can't recall a single one by which I've been this bored.    I have more than a few criticisms of the world that Erikson creates. Death, for example, is utterly meaningless. Three times in the first one hundred and fifty pages a character either died or was injured to the point that death was (according to the author) certain. But each time, the character was saved. I've frequently heard Gardens of the Moon described as \\"gritty.\\" But I fail to see what is so gritty about a work where death is simply a minor inconvenience. When the impact of death is minimized to the point of meaninglessness, there is no reason to worry about the characters. It effectively destroys any possibility of excitement.    Deus ex machina is rampant throughout Gardens of the Moon. Out of nowhere, some god or random magical ability will appear and determine the outcome of a battle. The problem with this, aside from the fact that it is simply poor writing, is that it makes reading everything leading up to the conclusion pointless. It doesn't matter how hard the armies fight, what tactics they use, etc., because some ridiculously powerful being is going to appear and decide the battle anyway. I have heard some users on here describe this as an assumption of the world - that power attracts power, which explains why gods appear seemingly at random. If that is an assumption of the world, it is merely an assumption that bad writing will be rampant throughout the series.    Aside from my criticisms of the substantive aspects of the book (the plot, the characters), I have a few criticisms from a more technical aspect. First of all, the dialogue is often terribly written. Pretty much every character speaks the same (save for the occasional one that refers to himself in the third person). And most of the dialogue is exceedingly unrealistic. I lost count of how many times I found myself thinking \\"come on, people just don't talk like this.\\"     Second, for all of Erikson's thorough description, the pages and pages he fills describing scenes, places, cities, etc., I don't remember much of anything about any of it. I've never seen an author write so much while saying so little. When I read George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones, by comparison, I could explain in detail pretty much every location mentioned. The descriptions were just as thorough, but the difference is that Martin painted a vivid, beautiful picture with words. As I mentioned earlier, Erikson can, on occasion, turn some very pretty phrases. But when you pare down even his most beautiful lines, they don't really say much. I can recall one particular scene where he devoted an entire paragraph, rife with beautiful lines, all to explain that the object in question was red. I love description when it is meaningful. But an author shouldn't need a paragraph to describe something as simple as what particular color an object is.    Third, Erikson insists on including excerpts of poetry at the beginning of many chapters (some others have lines from a history). Although the poetry is only a minor part of the book, it was so poorly written that almost every chapter started off on the wrong foot. To be honest, Erikson is no poet. The poems are choppy, long-winded and, as with much of writing, say very little. They never seemed to add anything to the work itself. Just another example, in my opinion, of Erikson's inclusion of passages that mean nothing and contribute nothing to the work.    Obviously, I strongly disliked Gardens of the Moon. Perhaps the biggest criticism I can ever give a book is that I simply didn't care about it. And I simply didn't care. I didn't care what happened to the world, I didn't care what happened to the characters. I didn't want to turn the next page because I didn't want to know what happened. I finished the book (on the third try) because I forced myself to do so. It was about as enjoyable as a root canal.    A lot of people love Gardens of the Moon. The world is incredibly deep and Erikson is a frequent and regular writer (as opposed to the ever late George R. R. Martin). But I detested it. In my opinion, if you want deep, complex fantasy, look to Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire or Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.  If you want good military fantasy, look to Glen Cook's the Chronicles of the Black Company. If you want an intelligently conceived and implemented magical system, look to Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series. There's nothing in Gardens of the Moon that isn't done better elsewhere.    If you really want to start reading Erikson's Malazan series, go for it. From what I hear, it gets better. But in my humble opinion, it couldn't get much worse.
B0036XN2L2|2.0|Lets really face the grade on this kids release at best. What are they saying here in words and music that hasn't been said a thousand times before.(NOTHING)Thanks for the great years of past love you guys forever,but this party has been over for awhile now!No true grit here like in the past,or any back bone on most of these songs. Just a weak and simple sing a long record for the masses.
B002VECM72|5.0|This will become classic film in the future. It has all the criteria to be a great film and then to be a true story is just unbelievable.

B002ZIAC26|5.0|I first saw Beach House in Omaha two years ago, and they were great.  I bought Devotion then and listened to it a lot.  That's still a great record, but they've improved greatly since then.  I just caught another concert of theirs in Omaha a few weeks back, and this newest album is the best yet.  Each song could've been a single!  The mood they establish over the course of the album is incredibly good.  This is music you won't forget...which is unfortunately more than I can say for most of the Pitchfork-reviewed BNM.

B002T9H2LK|4.0|Directed by Quentin Tarantino,he goes to a different level. Just as long as you can handle some subtitles this action, scalping and brutally killing Nazis sure makes up for it. Set throughtout the course of World War 2, its a lovely tale of what should have gone down to the Third Reich. Brad Pritt does a damn good job as his team of jews go after the Nazis and Christopher Waltz plays a bad German good at sniffing out jews. kick ass!
B000002KIK|5.0|I avoided this album for years, dreading worse sound quality than their fourth album, and worse material than Technical Ecstacy. What a suprise, then, to find that this is actually a very solid rock album. They are no longer the innovaters they once were, but this is still better than most albums you could compare it to. Business troubles and personal excess/exhaustion may have led to these conventional songs and stereotypical rock lyrics, but this is nonetheless a strong last word from a very significant band.
B00005JLCI|4.0|One of the main reasons for watching Kenneth Branagh's production of Hamlet is to see Derek Jacobi's remarkable portrayal of yet another Claudius--in this case the venomous usurper of Denmark's throne. Jacobi makes this often-forgettable part his own, to such an extent that he practically runs away with the show; and in Branagh's stellar cast, which includes Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, and Branagh as Hamlet, this is no mean feat. The dynamics between Claudius and Gertrude as their relationship subtly deteriorates during the course of the play are fascinating. Far from being one-dimensional, Jacobi's portrayal of Claudius is as vital as it is nuanced, and one finds oneself waiting for his entrance with great anticipation.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare productions are always innovative in respect to interpretation, settings, and cast. For example, he makes the subtext of the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia explicit in such a way that elucidates the rather salty lyrics of the songs in her mad scene. Most of Branagh's innovations work in this production with its opulent Edwardian costumes and mirrored sets, which make use of the exterior of Blenheim Palace as a background. While the manufactured snow sets a wintry mood for Shakespeare's metaphor for the sickness of the State, one must suspend one's disbelief when it comes to Ophelia's drowning with \\"fantastic garlands . . . of crow-flowers nettles, daisies\\" and other \\"weedy trophies,\\" since Shakespeare's \\"weeping brook\\" as Branagh presents the mise-en-scene would have been frozen solid (But in an otherwise excellent production, who cares about such picky details?).  One wonders, however, whether the rose-petals with which Branagh showers the actors in the court scene, as well as in \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" and \\"As You Like It,\\" are to be regarded as a signature, or as a cliche? The third time around, they are no longer an innovation. And although the swinging chandelier in the fencing scene seems rather Zorro-ish, since the scene calls for spectacle, why not?<br /><br />Branagh always takes chances in his casting, and in most cases in \\"Hamlet\\", they pay off. Billy Crystal plays a delightful comic-relief gravedigger along with Simon Russell Beale, and Robin Williams in his role as Osric serves a similar purpose in relieving the tension before the duel; Rosemary Harris and Charlton Heston are convincing as the player Queen and King; and Jack Lemmon's appearance as a guard is charitably short. Richard Attenborough brings outstanding dignity to his brief appearance as the British Ambassador, and I was blown away by the glimpse of Judy Dench as the grief-stricken Hecuba and John Gielgud as the dying Priam in the vignette about the Trojan War. Branagh's imaginative use of sundry theatrical luminaries both contributes texture to the play and adds interest to what might otherwise be a very long evening, since he presents Shakespeare's play almost in its entirety.<br /><br />The diction of the actors is superb, and the English subtitles ensure that every word of Shakespeare's text in this two disc-production will be understood.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I won't miss the Special Features, and the original theatrical version was fantastic. I don't really like watching how they stood in front of green screen while CGI was added later anyway. I prefer just to watch the movie...no frills. If a Special Edition does come out, that is the one I'll rent. As for 3D, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I will buy this on Earth Day. 5 Stars all the way.

B00371QQ2U|3.0|This is a review of the Blu ray 15th Anniversary edition of Apollo 13.  The movie is a masterpiece.  But, Universal's Blu-ray release leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />As others have said, it takes a long time to load.  I have a Samsung Blu-ray player that's less than a year old.  The player has the latest firmware and a broadband connection.  The movie takes a full four minutes to load.  Then, most of the time there is no play menu.  Instead, it goes into infinite loop - running the same few start-up pictures & music.  When this occurs, it's not possible to view the movie.<br /><br />After 3 tries, the menu finally came up and I was able to watch the film.  That resulted in more frustration.  Because, on my Blu-ray player at least, the viewing mode defaults to U-Control even when it hasn't been selected.  Meaning that there are almost constant pop-ups in the upper left portion of the screen.  Pushing the red button to turn off U-Control doesn't get rid of the pop-ups - U-Control continues to run in the background.  After much frustration, I figured out that I had to go into the little U-Control menu at the bottom right portion of the screen and turn it off.  Pausing the movie reactivates U-Control and the menu has to be accessed again to disable it.  Quite annoying!<br /><br />The film itself . . . well, some scenes are almost grainy, and I'm not referring to the old black & white news broadcasts.  It's as if Universal chose certain scenes to work on (like lift-off which is gorgeous!) and left the rest untouched.  The visual quality of most of the film has not benefited from the move to Blu-ray.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films.  But, if I'd known how frustrating this version would be to watch, I wouldn't have purchased it.

0316044695|2.0|You can't doubt the courage or heroism of Marcus Luttrell for one minute.  But as amazing as his story is the book was absolutely painful to read.  It is a very poorly written whining, political diatribe.  I understand he has strong opinions but the non-stop complaints about the liberal media were pathetic.  He actually blames the liberal media for the moral ambiguity he feels about whehter to kill a suspicious-looking group of Afghanis that he and his fellow Navy SEALs encounter at the start of his mission.  If you aren't prepared to deal with impossible situations and the consequences of your actions in combat without blaming the media and politicians, then you shouldn't be a Navy SEAL.      There are so many other well-written and even-handed books that celebrate the heroic stories of American soldiers.  Don't waste your time reading this one.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|The title for my review was chosen because terms like \\"wonderful\\",\\"masterpiece\\" and \\"great\\" are appropriately used in abundance in many other reviews. Unfortunately there are a handful of reviewers who liked Natalie's work with 10,000 Maniacs, but did not like this effort. That's too bad because I believe they are missing out on what she has accomplished here. I listen to and purchase a lot of music. LEAVE YOUR SLEEP is the best investment I have made so far in 2010. The quality and intelligence of the production will allow me to enjoy this music years from now as much as I do now. Get the 2 CD set for sure and recognize that Natalie continues to mature in a most positive way.

B0037AGASG|5.0|Just love it! Very uplifting and energetic song that brightens my day.<br /><br />I can't believe how people gave 1 star to this talented young man.<br />And their opinions only sounded like a group of kids bullying a talented kid out of jealousy,<br />and none of their opinions sounded fair. If he wasn't talented he wouldn't be out there, nor there would be people who enjoys his music. (Count me in!) So before you judge his song, take a look at yourself and see if you deserve any star at all for being so quick to judge.
0385504225|3.0|Based on the number of reviews on Amazon (2,380 and growing), I seem to be a bit late to the Dan Brown The Lost Symbol party. In my defense, I can say that I have been enjoying quite a few first time authors and some favorite authors returning to the book world. Further, as I read quite a few other books with a similar formula in the past year, I really didn't see the need to pick up another one. But this is Dan Brown after all. If you have read The Da Vinci Code, and I am guessing that you have, The Lost Symbol will feel like an old friend. The only differences I can tell between this book and The Da Vinci Code is that The Lost Symbol uses Masonic symbols and all of the action occurs within one day.     Robert Langdon has been asked by his friend, Peter Solomon, to give a presentation in Washington, DC. However, once Robert arrives, the meeting room is empty. It takes him a few moments to discover that he has been deceived. A phone call informs him that he is to unravel the Ancient Mysteries, part of Masonic lore, which will give a person the wisdom of the ages. If he solves the mystery, his friend will be released. Although, not in one piece. Peter's severed hand is in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda, tattooed with strange symbols. Langdon deciphers the clues and the race is on. Mal'akh, a heavily and intricately tattooed, muscle bound man, is the villain that will stop at nothing to posses the Ancient Mysteries so that he can rule to world. Taking the reader from the depths below the Capitol Building, to the streets of Washington, DC, and to areas above the city, this is a breathless action thriller where the activity occurs during one frantic night. Much like Langdon's previous adventures, the action rests only to provide the reader with some historical trivia or to explain some Masonic secret or code.    Dan Brown has delivered pretty much the same novel three times in a row. Only the secrets and symbols come from a different group, in this case, the Masons.Much of the history and design of Washington DC is due, apparently, from the Masons, which is interesting, Brown introduces several fascinating aspects of paintings and buildings, but does not delve more deeply into them. Further, he introduces the reader to Noetic Science, gives it a few pages, but from there does not provide the reader with more. Rather, it seems that he would prefer if we were to Google the term and learn more on our own. If those two things were important for Brown to include in the novel, he could have given them more pages and discussion, removing some of extraneous dialog, characters, or scenes. The final thing that surprised me in this novel was that all of the action occurs in and around Washington, DC. Langdon, in his previous adventures, worked his way around the world, introducing the reader to fascinating people, buildings, and areas. I cannot believe that Brown couldn't have Langdon and his associates travel to, say, Scotland or England, which, according to the book's text, were the early locations of Freemasonry. This could have given the reader a break from Washington, DC. If you are looking to reacquaint yourself with Robert Langdon and have a good time doing so, Brown delivers. For others that have read similar books in the time between The Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol, you may be disappointed.     Disclosure:   Obtained from: Friend   Payment: Borrowed

1438509480|3.0|I don't know if I just got a bad copy, but the editing and printing errors were so numerous that it was difficult to read the text.  It was evident that the book was never proofread.  I'll include the worst example I saw:    pg. 77 - \\"What is rv&nfLovia, or happiness: but a7~o~&d~wv, or, a good da~rnon, or spirit?\\"    Now, this example was the worst I saw, but I didn't get through much of the book because the errors distracted me too much, so there could be others as bad as this.  The bulk of the errors were spelling, punctuation, and paragraphing errors that made the text harder to follow than it should be.    That being said, I believe \\"Meditations\\" by Marcus Aurelius is a very worthwhile book to read and study, but I would discourage anyone from buying this printing of the book - find another version somewhere that has been proofread.
0812973992|4.0|I thought the premise of this book sounded really interesting - how all of the random people are interrelated during this short time period and primarily because of one event.  I won't go into too much more detail about the story, because many of the other reviewers have given a good summation of that.  However, I will tell you how I felt about the book as I read through it - I found the first two stories very easy to read and enjoy.  But then as I continued reading others with new characters it became difficult to really get into all of them.  I almost felt like there were just a few too many - you reach a certain point where you want to start seeing them all come together and for me that point came a little too late in the book.  Once that began to happen, I started to really enjoy the book again.  And after I finished it, I really liked the whole sum of the parts.<br /><br />We read this for my book club and I can tell you that I think other members felt the same way - when we met many had stopped reading, or hadn't finished due to their frustration.  Then after I told them that I liked it a lot more as I got through it, I think they persisted and agreed that it was better after getting closer to the end.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's brilliant the way the author thought up all of the unique characters and blended them into one story this way, I just thought the middle was a little choppy and difficult to read.  Definitely worth reading the entire thing though.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This goes down as my all time favorite King/Bachman story ever! It's in one word...HAUNTING! I am not one that typically re reads books over and over again, but that said...I have read this several times. The concept when written was light years ahead of its time. He made you believe that this premise of \\"game/competition\\" was indeed the future of where we are headed. I could not help but imagine that this was a likely senerio. After that set up, you can't help but have an interest in the characters and their outcome. Not only does this stay with you long after you have read it, but it's a rarity of book, that makes you wish you could read it again for the first time. Unlike some other reviewers I was not dissapointed with the ending and felt it was absolutely right on the money. I have yet to find another King that matches this intensity and gripping story line, but I sure wish he would head down this road again...now that's a walk I would take.
B0039OGGVQ|2.0|I was contemplating buying this album long before even came out. I saw best buy had it on sale for 7.99. So without hearing barely anything off of it, i gave in and picked up a copy.<br />What a disappointment. I guess I'm not hearing what everyone else is hearing in regard to this cd.<br />Someone wrote a review on here already and summed it up better than i can......<br />\\"the album sounds like 'b' side/leftover tracks from the artist singing on each track\\"<br />Hit the nail on the head for me right there. I dont agree necessarily that the entire album is that way. There are a few decent/somewhat memorable tracks such as:<br />Ghost-I love Ian Astbury and i do like the guitars and music and general feel of this song, it was a good way to start off the album.<br />Promise-I admit I am biased because i love Chris Cornell so much, he could sing the alphabet and i'd be happy. Not an above average song though, you would expect more from two of the biggest names in rock.<br />Gotten-Beautiful track actually. Adam Levine was a good choice.<br />Watch This-good for the guitars, this what i expected the album to sound like and it never got there.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks feel empty and quite frankly flow together so they all sound the same. Alot of people are raving about Beautiful Dangerous with Fergie. While its not bad, i find the chorus to be repitive and frankly rather irritating with the way she sings.<br />I expected much more, but I will admit I will continue to listen to it, in hopes that it will grow on me and perhaps i can come back and change my 2 star rating. But for now, 2 stars is being generous.......

B0015OKWL2|2.0|That's the sound of my hopes and expectations deflating.  Not to say that RIGHTEOUS KILL is a complete and utter disappointment (I guess it was worth borrowing for free from my local library), but I can't help but feel that it could have been so much more.<br /><br />One look at the cast and you have to think, \\"How can this be a miss?\\"  I mean, they could have just named this film \\"DeNiro & Pacino\\" and it probably would have done better at the box office.  Throw in the bonus talents of John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, and the normally riveting Brian Dennehy and you should have sure-fire cinematic gold, right?<br /><br />By and large, the talents of the actors listed above are not fleshed out in any compelling fashion.  I lay this squarely at the feet of director Jon Avnet, who somehow compiled a stellar cast and was unable to coax much emotion out of any of them.  They pretty much sleepwalk and mumble through the scenes, and the \\"live-wire\\" ones are devoid of passion even as the actors are shouting at each other.  I was largely unmoved by the characters and found myself growing annoyed by the near constant saturation of nearly every paragraph with the F-bomb with nothing to back it up.  I was especially disappointed by the passionless performance of Dennehy, whose trademark sneer and undulating fury have been substituted with a smirk and mild annoyance - a truly wasted opportunity to crank up the temperature on a potential potboiler.<br /><br />The script didn't help Avnet's cause, either.  Truly bizarre character relationships (a coroner and detective who work together have a largely emotionless but physically rough sexual affair that adds absolutely no intrigue or interest to the story) and out of place characters (Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson's scenes seemed to be only an excuse to get him on screen) only muddy the already strained performances.  The back cover quotes Larry King as saying the film has \\"a twist at the end that will blow you away.\\"  Larry King must not watch too many movies these days, as most seasoned viewers should have it figured out with 30-40 minutes to go.<br /><br />The DVD includes a couple of approximately 15 minute featurettes that were mildly interesting.  \\"The Thin Blue Line: An Exploration of Cops & Criminals\\" is produced just like something off Court TV, and could easily have been expanded to an hour (or heck, a series).  Unfortunately, it too falls short.  Literally.<br /><br />In good conscience, I can only recommend this film to hard-core fans of the cop-film genre.  DeNiro and Pacino fans will find far better performances elsewhere.<br /><br />The film is Rated-R for very pervasive language, violence, drug-use, and sexual content.hese days, as most seasoned viewers should have it figured out with 30-40 minutes to go.

B000S1O840|5.0|I bought this book after actually reading the novel so I had already fallen in love with the story itself which I think most people would want to do before risking buying a couple hundred dollar book. The fact that it is leather bound truly inspired me to buy it for I have the hard cover edition also but it's regular and cost around $20. The other thing I fell in love with was the front cover. Oh my gods is it beautiful cover. A beautiful golden Bengal tiger approaching you in a stealthy walk just screams the main themes and symbols of the novel. Anyone who has read the novel knows the importance of the Bengal tiger and Richard Parker. I do not know for certain. Though I am fairly sure that the front covers picture and design is made with 22 carat gold. Don't quote me though I only thought that because I saw the exact same novel on Amazon for $250 that said it was laced in 22 carat gold so I'm fairly sure it is. The other aspect is that ITS SIGNED BY YANN MARTEL! What Yann Martel fanatic or book collector doesn't want this treasure in their collection? Signed by the world famous Martel would definitely be a wow factor for anyone who loves the novel or a perfect gift for that special someone who fell in the love with the book. What better way of telling a person that you know them or thanking a person (say a teacher who introduced a student to the novel) by giving them a fabulous, rare Life of Pi novel? I'll tell you, no way. There is no better way! The pages are laced in gold as well. Covered in a fine layer of gold making the entire book sparkle with elegance. Included with a beautiful fabric book mark that matches perfectly with the novels leather binding. What I also enjoyed was the 'certificate of authenticity' also signed by Yann Martel and a witness. So you basically get two hand written signatures of Yann Martel what an awesome bonus!     I love this novel and just having such a fine symbolic appearance to the novel just evokes even stronger feelings of appreciation. Definitely worth the price. Besides, if it isn't bought for symbolic value you can at least use it for bragging rights. I mean what person has a $150-200 book that is laced in gold? Not very many. It makes an excellent conversation starter.    - Life of Pi Fan. (I have chosen the \\"better story\\")Save dry, yeastless factuality for the scientists :P (though ironically I am one)

B0034KVTIK|5.0|I had to do a transatlantic weekend to be there for this event last summer, and now that the Live disc has been released (and Blu-Ray DVD soon to be released), I am transported back to that magical evening at the 02 Indigo.  Incognito fans, and fans of The Good Groove should make haste and get this set.  The live treatments to the songs on the two CD's (yes, its a two-disc set) bring added depth, vocal performances are off the hook and the musicians brought their A-game to the stage...my special treat was hearing Jocelyn Brown singing her club classic (with Inner life), the Ashford & Simpson penned, Ain't No Mountain...WITH STRINGS!!!

0393072231|3.0|I'm probably more of a 3.5 star on this one, unfortunately this rating is not available on Amazon. I was really excited to read this book after I saw Lewis on Stephen Colbert and read that he wrote a book about the poorest team in baseball having the best winning record (the A's). Not coming from a business/mathematical/statistical background, I enjoy unearthing my ignorance about what goes on Wall Street- I've always been fascinated by its complexities, it seems like a black hole in that few truly understand it entirely, but plenty are sucked into it. It reminds me of \\"Maxwell's demon\\", that perpetual motion machine that is so mysterious in \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\". Metaphors aside, this book didn't necessarily enlighten me the way I thought it would.    It was very good, however. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters he chose and the thematic structure of the book. The fact that they each had their own flaws and idiosyncrasies that allowed them to adopt a cynical (but profitable) worldview was interesting as well. Eisman, to me, was the highlight of the book. On my commute to work, I find myself giggling about some of the things he did. He reminds me of who I would be in this story, if I had the balls. I just think of a guy sitting in a large board room with a bunch of Ivy League yuppies, all sucking the d*** of the latest Wall Street crooked fabrication of subrime mortgages, and he raises his hand (during a lecture) and asks the speaker something along the lines of \\"What is the estimated default rate of your synthetic CDOs\\" that the guy was praising, who replies \\"At its highest it is 5%\\", wherein Eisman replies, making a zero with his hand \\"There is ZERO probability that only 5% will default!\\"     I mean, his whole lot during the subprime fad was to just blow people's views out of the water. I loved that! It was like it was revenge for him. And he also just seemed like one of those big characters that you wouldn't necessarily want to be around, but you could still appreciate for how outrageous and eccentric he is. Any great figure in history is an eccentric, and even though these guys will not be lauded for making money off of the downfall of modern finance the way MLK was for Civil Rights, they still are important. The other guys were just as interesting, too. Vinny was interesting, just because he grew up lower-middle class and was a natural-born skeptic.     Burry was extremely interesting as well. I mean, the guy is a resident neurosurgeon, and he finds time to start a hedge fund?!?! Much less one that earns 478%?!?! Talk about eccentric. It pissed me off, though, that no one appreciated him, and he will never really get the recognition that he deserves for being such a genius. I love finding out about people like this, just to show you what the human mind is capable of. I'm not an investor, but his asocial and incentives based outlook on life was a big part of his success, which intrigued me. I ended up reading his letters to his investors out of curiosity, and they're pretty interesting.     The main thing I liked about the book, I suppose, is how Lewis tied all of these different character traits together and showed he it led them to predict the catastrophe. I liked the psychological aspect of each of the characters, and how each of them had to deal with such an optimistic world while being so cynical. I also learned a good deal about the inner workings of Wall Street, but that wasn't my favorite part about it. I thought at points it was a bit overwhelming, not intellectually, but he just went too far. Whatever it was, the technical aspect of the book is not what I enjoyed, but the characters. I would definitely recommend this book for the eccentric, interesting characters it presents.

B003FSTN7A|5.0|I usually give this series four stars instead of 5.  I typically justify this by saying it has too many sappy and sentimental moments to it.  However, I must admit, I basically like it the way it is.  Patricia Arquette has long before this show been an excellent actress.  She brought all her film ability to the small screen.  That sets this show apart immediately as an A list actress anchors it. She believably plays a wife and mother who is also a psychic. She is able to see the dead or threatened in both her dreams and at times while awake.<br /><br />She has three daughters, all of whom are gaining the same ability.  I especially enjoyed the daughters this season.  Two scenes spring to mind: Ariel, the eldest, dealing with a giant Beaver ghost who is making a small boy's mother miserable AND Bridget, the middle daughter, who works in the library (to pay off her fines) who writes an email for a dead woman and sees a trickster in princely array, thus identifying the source of his fraud.  There are many more incidents but these two kids are terrific and have really hit their strides with the series.<br /><br />Joe, the husband and father, is odd man out, as he cannot see any of these things, which are daily grist for the rest of his family.  Ironically, the wacko techie genius he now works for makes his family members seem normal! There are some very funny scenes with Joe attempting to work with this guy, which alleviate the tension from the rest of the show. One scene with the department of defense and these two is uproarious.<br /><br />Bringing up the rear are the DA and the detective.  They actually have very little screen time which is to the good.  They do not bring anything unusual or interesting to the series but we do need to see the psychic working within the DA's office and with the police.<br /><br />The guest stars are pretty good but over time it is this week in and week out cast which has made the series something to look forward to as one's weekly viewing.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0026KO7D8|5.0|If you are looking for motivation and inspiration this is it. The author, Harv, comes off a little corny at first but that is not what you are to focus on - it is the technique and the affirmations. There is no forumla as to \\"how to\\" with this book there is just the affirmations and accomplishing those affirmations that are the secrets of the millionaire mind. If you are looking for \\"how to's\\" then I suggest listening to this first and then purchasing additional books or going to the library to learn about how to increase Net Worth NOT Net Income. Lastly, another author says that the market only pays you for the skills that you bring to the market. You must increase your skills and work harder on yourself than you do on your job.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|This show was cut off way too short.  I'm a fan of several sci-fi series and this had the potential to be one of the better ones.  When I describe this show to others I say that it is Deep Space Nine with a little Xena warrior princess (for the cheese factor).  There are a few first-season kinks in it but overall the potential for spin-off story lines and interesting quirks was excellent.  The film Serenity based upon this series is a quick version of the entire season and ties up some loose ends but there are still many unanswered questions and I really wish they would have let the characters develop more and at least given it another season.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I haven't even seen this movie but I can attest to the fact that slaughterhouses are grim places and the beef industry a sad one, indeed.  After hauling cattle and hogs in a tractor-trailer to these charnel houses I have seen with my own eyes the impersonal, utterly depressing truth of factory farming.  The sweet momma cows who have given up their babies year after year until they can no longer produce 26 gallons of milk per day are then consigned to the hamburger trade.  They load up well since they are used to being handled and their udders, grossly distended from having not been milked in anticipation of slaughter, sway awkwardly.  As a former nursing mom I felt so sorry for this condition which I know from personal experience to be painful!<br /><br />Sometimes they would go down in transit and the kill plant would chain the cow's legs and drag her off the truck then lift her in the bucket of a front-end loader.  I remember one's udder leaking milk onto the dung-encrusted floor of the trailer ( We clean them but they fill up fast! ) in below-zero temps, leaving a frozen reminder of her service to mankind on the eve of her death.  It seemed obscene to trample the remnant of life-giving milk in the process of unloading the rest of them.<br /><br />While waiting to unload once I observed the cows go into the building, then somewhere within the next 30 feet behind the closed doors they met their deaths.  Then the bloody hides, so recently clothing a living creature, rose up a conveyor belt and fell in a heap into a dump truck to be taken to a tannery.  Every 40 seconds or so a fresh hide emerged from the building, steaming in the chilly air.  Talk about gluttony!  And all I could think about was the fat, oblivious masses of people gorging on fast food with no thought where it came from.<br /><br />I no longer eat hamburgers, hotdogs, bologna, or any other kind of processed meat that is ground up and reformed  ( I WILL NOT let my son eat chicken nuggets! ) because the sanitation practices necessary to a wholesome product seem unattainable to me with a workforce whose native language is not English.  The illegal immigrant situation is yet another aspect of this scenario; illegals can be forced to work in hideous conditions for fear of being turned in.  The little Latinas who worked in chicken plants when I hauled a reefer ( That's a refrigerated unit to you stoners out there! ) couldn't believe that a WOMAN was driving a truck all by herself.  When it dawned on them, they invariably burst out in broad smiles.  I hope they saw a way out of an abusive relationship or something by seeing me do that; apparently some illegal men have been known to terrorize their women the way employers terrorize them.<br /><br />At any rate, the food industry needs to be rethought from top to bottom.  Thomas Jefferson himself envisioned a nation of small-holders,each with his ( or her! ) own farm, each capable of self-sufficiency.  I'll be buying this movie ASAP!necessary to a wholesome product seem unattainable to me with a workforce whose native language is not English.

B00371QQ2U|5.0|I'll begin with:  Yes, this movie does load quite slowly compared to other movies.    However, once you see how crisp and clear the picture is, the load times are a minor inconvenience.  There are some movies that just had really bad transfers to blu-ray, this movie definitely is not one of them.  I can't even begin to explain how beautiful the launch sequence is.      There are a lot of reviews here saying the disc doesn't work.  I'm not sure what's up with that, my blu-ray player plays it perfectly fine, and no, there has never been nor is there currently a firmware update for my player.  Toshiba BDX-2000, nothing high end in the least bit.  My player has NO internet connection to it.  Those here saying you need to have an internet connection to play this disc are ignorantly wrong.  Leads me to believe that there was a bad batch of discs and that those having issues just have bad discs that need to be exchanged.  I've seen it happen many times before for DVDs and I see no reason why it can't happen on blu-ray as well.      If you're hesitant to purchase this, don't be.  Give it a try.  This is an amazing movie made only better by blu-ray.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|An excellent and cute story. Another great film from Miyazaki-san and Studio Ghibli. Definitely one to add to your movie collection. Yet, it does not hold the same majesty as some of the previous ones like Totoro or Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke).
B003DRWX9I|5.0|Rock really needed someone to keep its true spirit alive.  Old style riffs, original style songs, and some of the best vocalists of our time... and Slash... make that guitar continue to sing!  Every track brings me a great place I kinda lost in my life.  Thnak you Slash and everyone else who made this happen.
B002RSDW80|4.0|This movie is such a missed opportunity at greatness.  Streep is a revelation as Julia Child, she's touching, funny, and she does a great mimic of her without it being a caractature; this is a real triumph.  Stanley Tucci is almost her equal as her supportive, loving husband.  The part of this movie that focuses on Julia Child is as good as any movie I saw in all of 2009.  Now for the other part..uggg..Amy Adams is HORRIBLE in this, she sucks all the wind out of her character.  The woman has no chemistry with the unknown shlep playing her immasculated husband.  I never pulled for her in this, and when she finds out Julia didnt appreciate her effort and didnt like her, I said, Amen sista!!  She is the anti Sandra Bullock, she reminds me of Sarah Jessica Parker in that, you just never really like her.  I was so frustrated with this movie, I kept yelling at the screen, \\"Go back to Julia!!!\\".  I think i can speak for anybody who saw this movie or will see this movie in saying, first of all Streep should have taken home the Oscar, and second uh Streep should have taken home the Oscar.  Half of a great movie.
B000007MVM|5.0|This collection of songs, while certainly not the most well produced in the world, are, I think, some of the most compelling.  Unfortunately, many people seem only willing to look at it on the surface, and see it as a sort of novelty.  Even many of the reviews on this site are focused mainly on the supposed state of mind Syd Barrett was in while recording this album. And indeed, it is a very compelling legend, that of Syd.  Pink Floyd has made their entire career on selling Syd's legend as art.. so I understand the temptation to see this album from the point of view of a man losing his mind.    However... I think that it is only a small part of the picture, and I think that it does a disservice to the legitimacy of this material as art.  There is a book called \\"The Making of The Madcap Laughs\\" by Malcolm Jones, who acted as producer on a large chunk of Barrett's solo output, including much of the material from the Opel CD, as well as many tracks from this album.  In the book, Jones describes the sessions as productive and relatively trouble free.  He mentions briefly the lack of studio time for The Soft Machine to adequately rehearse and learn the abrupt changes in the songs, and Jones laments that he was not able to book more time for them.  He describes Barrett as being enthusiastic, lucid, upbeat, and very inspired.    This is quite a different picture than what Waters and Gilmour have had to say about their brief three session wrap-up of the production.    I bring this up because I obviously think that too much emphasis is put on Syd's supposed \\"madness\\" when discussing his music.    I think these songs are brilliant.  For a variety of reasons, many of the sessions were rushed, and probably could have been recorded better.  There is no denying that.  However, Jones also mentions in his book that Syd had a tendency to become less enthusiastic in performing his songs after doing multiple takes, so often they would stop after 3 or 4 takes and leave them for overdubs later.  I think if they had been recorded to perfection, they would have lost much of the charm that these recordings now possess.  The lyrics on this album are some of the most evocative and baffling that I've ever heard... particularly on Octopus, Dark Globe, and Feel.  It's clear that Syd has been influenced by his experiences with drugs, but it's also clear that he isn't just talking nonsense.  The imagery that he uses is certainly deliberate and focused.  After hearing the album, you may never want to hear another song from it for the rest of your life, but I bet if you were to listen to it a few more times and start picking up on the lyrics, you'll find that you won't be able to get it out of your head.      This is one of my favorite albums.  For whatever reason, Syd lost interest in music after one more album.  It's a shame, but in a way it also makes his few recordings unique and special.  The emphasis on his mental illness is, I think, highly overblown... but if it helps to get his name out there so that others can enjoy these recordings for years to come, then I guess it is a small price to pay.  I just wish more people took his albums seriously.
0634022296|5.0|I could've been learning how to play on these songs instead of The Who and The Clash (not that that's too bad a thing).  All I'm saying is that this book really simplifies playing Beatles songs, and when it's not so simple, there are the chord charts at the top of the page.  Now go play \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" at capo 7. It's really easy.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|The guys at 37s know their stuff. This book is worth every penny, and I'll probably read it several times more.

B00337KM2S|3.0|I think this is where the viewer's own experience will figure in his/her reaction to this rather sad comedy.<br /><br />On the plus side, the arguments for why losing a good job is one of life's great opportunities are presented for what they are--nonsense, especially in the current job market.  As that ridiculously stereotyped young lady explains how being fired is just a step towards new horizons.  On the minus, there seemed to be a morality tale, as if Clooney was somehow being punished in his private life as comeuppance for what he did for a living.<br /><br />There is some clever dialog but even here its giving with one hand while taking with the other.  The subtext is that if you're clever and articulate enough you can convince people that the loss of a job, while serious, is likely to be an opportunity.  And frankly, the alternative to Clooney's lifestyle, the young midwestern couple getting married, didn't look all that appealing, either.<br /><br />No doubt this movie will resonate with a small number of people who ended up better off as the result of a layoff and those are the stories everyone likes to hear.  I worked for a company where everyone lost their job so I have some idea of the probabilities.  But its ironic, don't you think, that if people like Ryan Bingham actually exist, on the one hand, a company could be desperately trying to save money by firing staff while on the other, cover the cost of flying somebody all over the country to do what their own personnel department should do?
B002ZCDR88|5.0|For me, two of the more sublime female recording artists today are Natalie Merchant and Joni Mitchell.  Original and ethereal, you won't find bubblegum gaga here! I continue to be \\"hypnotized, mermerized\\" by Natalie's opiate voice.  This is a wonderful work which combines her emotional artistry with that of literary masters, creating an inviting, haunting web which wraps up the listener better than a golden spider ever could!  Besides her vocal art, she gives you a hard-cover book with background sketches, photos, the words to the songs - more than one could ask for!  Highly recommended!

B001AQMBNC|3.0|It's difficult to rationally judge a film that appears to be a rip-off of \\"E.T.\\". But the script for \\"Starman\\" kicked around for a few years before \\"E.T.\\" was made, and got the green light only after the huge success of Spielberg's film.<br /><br />Even if \\"E.T.\\" had never been made, \\"Starman\\" would still be hopelessly derivative. The original \\"Day the Earth Stood Still\\" defined the \\"benevolent alien visitor\\" genre, and no one has done much to improve on it. The alien is feared by the government (chasing him with Intent To Kill or Vivisect); he/it is aided by humans who understand he's here Only To Do Good; he possesses Strange Powers; and let's not forget the Christ Parallel, which both films lay on with a trowel. The principal difference between \\"Starman\\" and \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" is that Michael Rennie /doesn't/ impregnate Patricia Neal. (As far as we know.)<br /><br />Though \\"Starman\\" has a few amusing \\"alien out of ether\\" moments, the story chugs through mechanically to its predetermined ending, with no real surprises. The opticals and special effects look dated by today's standards. It's not a /bad/ movie, just not a very original one.<br /><br />The only good thing is (of course) Jeff Bridge's marvelously ingenuous performance, which got him an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />The image quality is what one would expect from Blu-ray, but there's zero bonus material.
B000GG4XJM|4.0|Springsteen set up a group of acoustic musicians to record \\"We Shall Overcome\\" in 1997 for [[ASIN:B000006C89 Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger]]. Then in 2005 and 2006 he then brought them back to the farmhouse the for two more sessions to record the rest of the present album and DVD. According to his discussion in the DVD he wanted to take songs which would otherwise be \\"lost\\" to the present generation of listeners unless they were \\"recontextualized\\".<br /><br />I take that neologism to mean he wanted to recreate the songs not as folk tunes per se but as a modern stylistic synthesis. In this he succeeded very well, assembling a fascinating group of musicians to create a medley of sounds bringing together much of what has made American music unique in the world.<br /><br />Taking the vocals first, I've got to admit that in general I have never been attracted to Springsteen's voice but in this album he seems to succeed in his attempt to create a more \\"southern\\", \\"jazzy\\" style. His background singers were wonderful. His female backup singers especially have an excellent understanding of southern gospel style for such songs as \\"O Mary Don't You Weep No More\\". \\"We Shall Overcome\\", however is entirely unlike the way you usually hear it, but not in an unpleasant way, just different. However in my opinion this song missed the vocal power that makes you want to weep because he didn't let the backup singers run with it.<br /><br />I was impressed with the versatility of the instrumentalists. Fiddlers were as awesome as the female vocalists. I caught them playing everything from old time Appalachian to New Orleans to Klezmer to straight bluegrass (and even a little Rimsky-Korsakov). Same with his banjoist who seems quite familiar with clawhammer style as well as a lot of the classic bluegrass licks. Guitars played solid acoustic rhythm for the most part but I heard his backup guitarist doing some pretty good jazz/blues runs.<br /><br />Brass, saxophones and accordions in popular music are most often relegated to very brief licks but here they had some pretty good chances to play some really awesome jazz.<br /><br />Percussion? Lets just say that I usually feel a transient urge to strangle any drummer who inflicts himself onto a folk band. I didn't feel at all that way for this one. Both the drummer and the mixing engineer made an extraordinary effort to keep things controlled and it worked out well. I'd like to hear a better tambourine player than Springsteen. In his favor, Springsteen doesn't play a half bad harmonica. Keyboardists were excellent and solid throughout.ic are most often relegated to very brief licks but here they had some pretty good chances to play some really awesome jazz.    Percussion?

B001OQCV6K|1.0|I've watched and enjoyed many incarnations of Sherlock Holmes over the years and this is the first I totally disliked. It's hard for me to determine if my dislike for the film was a result of the total recasting of Holmes and Watson or the absurdly inappropriate film techniques (that owe more to the Matrix than to Masterpiece Theater).<br /><br />The jagged, quick cut edits and gimmicky \\"stop action\\" sequences detracted from the story telling to the point where they became the center of attraction. When that happens, the egos of the director and the cinematographer intrude. They're playing games with the film -- if they want to be the stars, let them get jobs as actors. The juxtaposition of such by-now-cliched action film techniques with the historical setting was jarring and made the movie seem more comic-book like than was probably intended.<br /><br />Even if I could get past the annoying film techniques, I couldn't buy Robert Downey Jr as Holmes. For more than a century, Sherlock Holmes has been an iconic figure -- brooding, cool, and cerebral. Downey's Holmes appears borderline psychotic, a kind of disturbed (and disturbing) Victorian Batman complete with flying cape. Holmes is seldom a \\"likeable\\" fellow in the original books and in films, but this version was repulsive and scarey.<br /><br />I know film makers today feel they have to be \\"edgy\\" (heaven forbid a main character should smile!) but personally I prefer my protagonists to have at least a few redeeming qualities and for the emphasis to be on the story rather than the presentation of a \\"Blair Witch\\" visual roller-coaster ride.

If I had to pick a favorite, I honestly don't know you I would choose.<br />I love Clary's determination, Simon's originality, Isabelle's style & attitude, Alex's \\"secret life\\", Jace's sense of humour & fondness for Clary, Luke's gentleness & fierceness. Each and every character as this little something that makes them so unique and lovable.<br /><br />It was also nice to visit Alicante.

1400097029|4.0|John Banville is an enormously gifted writer of the first order. The Sea is a book that contains such lovely imagery and language that it frequently verges on poetry. A late middle aged man dealing with the loss of his wife retreats into his past and the realm of memory to deal with grief.  Skillfully weaving present and past as his character relates his inner dialogue , the Sea invites the reader to slowly absorb each page and scene as the story unfolds. I agree with other reviewers that Banvillle is a writer for whom style and the moment represented in rich language is as important as plot. Nevertheless I enjoyed this book and would recommend giving it a try. Keep a dictionary handy a Banville is unafraid to use an extensive and challenging vocabulary without seeming overly pretentious.

Mr. Lewis may have gotten a bit too insider-y with the technical jargon for my taste, but I was still able to follow the machinations of the book.  But I didn't think that the book really got rolling until the final chapter, which is devoted to taking more of a big picture look at the collapse.<br /><br />Recommended for all readers.

How many rappers have ever sampled Neil Peart? Geddy Lee is so ridiculous, you have to smile.     It is part of rock history, and it has it's place. You have to laugh at it thou, it's goofy, I can't imagine trying to listen to the whole album. The first couple parts of 2112 hit that junior high rock vibe, it's Rush, a guilty pleasure like candy that makes your teeth ache.
B00275EGX8|1.0|There is a reason no one cares to watch this movie, even after all that Oscar hype. We are simply tired of war soap operas. We really are. We are tired of nonsense wars, we are tired of spreading the kind of freedom that nobody wants and we are tired of sending our sons and daughters to supposedly defend our country by ways of invading and occupying foreign countries. This while the State propaganda (Minitruth) is busy at home telling the consumers (those would be us) how important it is to blow up and kill people abroad and destroy their lives and while our own country is falling apart, impoverished and exhausted.    Really, you want to see what war looks like from way above? Try the wikileaks site and see how heroic it is to mow down a couple dozen innocent and unarmed people and then call it a victory.    And if you want a sylized rendition of what those freedom-starved natives think of us and what anyone with a working mind and beating heart does when confronted with these situations, go watch Avatar.

B000002A3T|5.0|I have every Pink Floyd album going all the way back to Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  Pink Floyd is one of the most innovative bands of all time.  I have listened to The Division Bell many times since it was first released.  The more I listen to it, the better it gets.  What strikes me most is David Gilmour's outstanding guitar playing is still there, but his song writing is equally good. He's also got a great voice. I enjoyed A Momentary Lapse of Reason, but I think this one is Pink Floyd's best since The Wall. High Hopes, Coming Back to Life, Keep Talking, Take It Back, all great Floyd songs. I have come to believe that Pink Floyd was just as much David Gilmour as it was Roger Waters.  I don't understand all the negative reviews saying this isn't Pink Floyd.  As long as Gilmour is there, it's still Pink Floyd.  They made their best albums with Waters and Gilmour, but Gilmour has really done a good job of keeping Pink Floyd alive.  I think if any real Pink Floyd fan gave this an open minded listen, they would find that it is just as good as anything Floyd has done.  My only complaint is that they haven't released a new album since.  Great album.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|It's rare to have a rock musician have a soild knowledge of classical music. It's even rarer to have a classical musician who has a depth of understanding of what music people listen to today. Tony Banks fits both categories perfectly, with his classical piano background and his years as the keyboard player/occasional rhythm guitarist of Genesis. Most tracks are around 3-4 minutes and has actual titles for each piece! This small detail shows Banks's attention to the way people listen to music today, instead of forcing listeners to sit through long passages with numeric titles which makes it hard to remember which piece was which.    Seven is not as stormy as others would have you believe (The Ram is the only track with a bit of fire). In fact, Seven is actually very subtle. Each piece (with respect to dynamics) builds in and out smoothly and camly. I don't mean to say that classical music is relegated to being background music, but Seven is a very nice album to listen to for warm spring days or anytime a calm atmosphere is needed. It's actually fairly minimally orchestrated, which is also, in a way, a reflection of his time in Genesis (recall that the band went from being a quintet to a trio fairly quickly).    As a side point, it is interesting to hear rock musicians record classical-style music and by doing so set the way it should sound. We don't know exactly how the classical composers of old would have exactly wanted their compositions to sound. And I find it interesting that in two hundred years, music-lovers will be talking about Tony Banks (and perhaps Billy Joel, whose Etudes I have not had a chance to listen to yet) the way we now talk about Chopin and Beethoven.    The disappointing aspects of Seven are few. Banks is listed as the piano player, but there's barely any piano in Seven at all! It says he recorded his part separately, so I'm surprised we don't hear more of him playing. Also, I have read elsewhere that he did not pursue a classical piano careerbecause he wasn't technically proficient enough, but since he's writing the music here he could easily write to his own comfort level. I would have also liked to hear some of his fabulous synthesizers with the orchestra here too, or if not the electronic route, a pipe organ (think of a pipe organ version of \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" or \\"Watcher of the Skies\\"). But, since it is a calm, even album, that may not have been appropriate for Seven. (That may be an idea for a follow-up classical album!)    Overall, Seven represents an interesting new direction for Banks. I highly recommend this album for both the classical and rock sides of today's musical audience.
B000002HPV|5.0|Björk's piece \\"All Is Full of Love\\" on her album, Homogenic, is nothing short of a spiritual experience. Now this may seem to be a very strong statement, and I guess it is. Perhaps, it is not one that I should be making. Perhaps, it is much too strong. However, I would like to follow in the footsteps of much electronic and Technosonic music; just as much of this genre of music has been questioned and criticized as to not being art, as to not being music, I dare you to criticize my statement.  I refuse to not give this song the credit it deserves. I am going to be bold just like Technosonic artists, such as Luigi Russolo, have done in the past, and I am going to say once again that \\"All Is Full of Love\\" is nothing short of a spiritual experience.       Björk's talent is incredible, and she may have the most haunting voice I have ever heard. It almost has an ethereal quality and feels as if she could be singing from a different realm; one where people know something that we don't here, where they know some clue about life, and all of us are just dying to get the answer.        It's not only her voice in this song that makes it so breathtaking, and yes, spiritual. Rather, it is the way she layers her voice amidst all the other elements of the song, and how she manages to layer all of those elements together as well. There is so much depth to this song, and it makes it not only beautiful to listen to, but it aids in the message of the piece that she is trying to share with the listeners: All is full of love.       If anything catches me at all about this song, it is the way that Björk uses the different musical elements to aid in telling a story, to aid in sharing a message. She utilizes them in new ways, and it is in her experimentation with elements, and like many electronic musicians before her, her lack of fear when it comes to being innovative and being different that enables her to create something so different. She shows the listeners that maybe different is not such a bad thing after all.       One example of the layering of musical elements that I was referring to is the use orchestral instruments in this piece. Björk starts off the piece with a moving, driving rhythm of orchestral instruments, particularly strings, which continue through a short crescendo until her voice is introduced. Just as she begins to sing and starts giving the introduction to her powerful message, the strings behind her seem to fade into a mystical echo, and the listeners hear the occasional strum of guitar strings or harps strings behind her. The use of these instruments helps to make this message seem more moving and significant. What is probably most enticing about it is that while uses these traditional instruments, she still manages to keep them beautiful by utilizing them in a nontraditional way. She finds a good balance and doesn't significantly degrade and play with the orchestral instruments too much as some electronic artist sometimes do, which often times just ends up taking away from the piece.       The other element of this song that is probably most effective is Björk's use of panning. Now, if you did not notice this upon listening, please, do yourself a favor and go listen to the song again. You honestly cannot get the full effect of this song, feel that \\"spiritual experience,\\" and be so taken over by the message if you don't hear how the panning interacts with the vocals. When she starts the chorus that just repeats \\"All is full of love,\\" a higher pitched voice is introduced (repeating the same message) and the message pans between the speakers. It is one of the most effective techniques I have ever heard in a song because as you are being told that \\"All is full of love,\\" you are hearing the message in all the space around you; it is traveling from left to right and back again. This panning is intermixed with her original pitched vocals repeating \\"All is love,\\" which is going into a crescendo, and there is also a sound that seems to be in front of you; it resembles something similar to the sound of a rain stick, but with more electronic tones that decrescendos as it plays. It truly feels as if you are being immersed in an experience, not just a musical experience, but a real experience that has the ability to grab your emotions and teach you something.       If you have not gotten anything from this review, please just remember this: great music is an experience and it creates a one-of-a- kind moment. Maybe you will disagree, but if you really want to experience that feeling, go listen to this piece. It will truly move you. It moved me. Björk's artistry has shown me that maybe all is full of love, or at least I am full of love for this piece.
