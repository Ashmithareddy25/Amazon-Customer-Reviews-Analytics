B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved every minute of it, but hated the ending, had to stop several times to wipe my tears before proceeding.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I enjoyed most of this game.  There were spots that frustrated me due to: system issues, meaning it took multiple clicks of doing the same thing to get it to work, and 2, there were times when I had no idea what I was supposed to do.  I muddled my way through it and overall found it to be a good time killer.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app is so user friendly...It has helpful footnotes and cross references...and I especially appreciate the parallel translations!  It makes Bible study easy and more interesting then ever!
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|The game desperately needs checkpoints or a resume feature in the later (longer) levels especially.<br /><br />Nothing ruins a good time like spending a minute going through a level and timing all the jumps and traps right, and then you mess up 10 seconds before the finish line and land in one of the &#34;pit&#34; spots that have no exit or way out and the game makes you start the entire level over again from scratch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Closure. It's not pretty but raw the way life really is.  I put off reading the end, fearing disappointment.  But am happy to say my fears were all unnecessary.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is very similar to an emersion program I bought for my computer a couple years ago. I downloaded this one onto my Kindlefire, and find myself using it way more since it's so portable. I like the feature of learning to write in Spanish at the same time--makes me pay more attention to the details. I just finished Lesson 3 and so far I'm loving it!
B003THHIEM|5.0|Castle season 1 was fantastic.  I wish I started watching this series sooner.  It was nice having the season online so I could watch every episode when I wanted and commercial free.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This is so crazy. Have tried to install this on my kindle fire and it keeps telling me not enough memory. It is crazy because I play this on my samsung galaxy s3 all the time but cannot get it to install on fire. Hopefully this will get fixed soon
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I do not normally watch anything zombie, vampire or werewolf. That being said I was intrigued by the trailer and so I rented it. Very fast paced film of a rapidly spreading pandemic that kills its victim in minutes and leaves a zombie. Lots of great eye candy scenes and actually a pretty good story. Unless you are an absolute Brad Pitt fanatic rent this one instead of buying a movie you will probably enjoy only once.
B000I9YX06|5.0|I, Robot was an amazing film. I could not believe I hadn't heard about it before. When my brother suggested watching this, I was skeptical at first, but after the first ten minutes in, I knew, just by the style and feel of the movie, I was comfortable and engaged in the story. Detective Del Spooner, (Lead Character with fantastic acting on Will Smith's behalf) is great character with loads of style, well timed slapstick humor and a grim outlook at the technology of his day. He is sure the robots are bad news and one day will go rouge. The animation was an ideal complement to the film; smooth, clear, beautifully designed, and moved fluidly across the screen. Story-line was steady and unbroken throughout. No pot hole or string left hanging, but all lose ends tied and solved at the ending. Genre is detective, mystery, action and a small amount of humor.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Enjoyed this game. The graphics were very pleasing and large enough to see without straining. The sound effects were relaxing and not irritating like some game sounds can become. Highly recommended.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game and play it everyday.  The only thing I don't like is that you have to spend money to get anywhere in the game.
1439193630|5.0|If you are considering a career in writing this is one of the best books you will ever read. I recommend downloading the Audible version also and hear Stephen King's own voice! He is one of the most prolific authors out there today. Even if you do not like his genre, you will love this book about how he became successful. Read it more than once! :-)
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This was an awesome sequel, despite being over 1000 pages, I flew through it. I also laughed hard when I flipped past Chapter One Hundred and Eleven and saw there were quite a few chapters to go...Who writes a book over 111 chapters long? Patrick Rothfuss, that's who.<br /><br />As to the actual story: The story picks up pretty much where the last one left, Kote the Innkeeper, telling the story of his days as Kvothe the student. Kvothe is back at school, still looking for information on the Chandrian and the Amyr, trying to find the mystery of who killed his family. He gets in a bit of trouble (no big surprise) and is asked to take a vacation. He travels in search of answers and a patron, one adventure leading into another.<br /><br />I loved and hate that we got to know Denna...In the previous book, I noticed how many strong female personalities were involved in the story and speculated that Denna didn't really add anything. Kvothe loves her, but he can't tell her or himself...But PR delved into Denna a bit, and now instead of disliking her I feel sorry for her. All she knows of men, is that they will oppress women, and while that's not true of every man, she's clearly been hurt enough that she can't ever move on to someone else. I loved Kvothe's journey with Tempi and the Adem; I thought it reflected well on real life: some cultures will never understand each other unless an effort is made to try. I think the Maer's wife is a biotch but what can you do... I think there is reflections on reality there too: racism and unpleasant people will alway be a part of life.<br /><br />I'm curious about Bast. What is his place in all this. He isn't human, but he's Kote's student. He wants his teacher to remember who he is, but why? and is he good or evil? at the end of the book it looks like his character could be considered either.<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed it, the story meandered enough you could believe this was someone's life and not so much the story strayed from point. Its just a fantastic adventure.point. Its just a fantastic adventure.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun for every one in the family.Ive played this game a lot, and it has never failed. Very fun, a must for all kids with tablets who love horses.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Natalie Portman's performance as Nina is fantastic!  This movie will grab you from the beginning and won't let you go until the credits roll.  I really enjoyed how they played with the themes of Swan Lake in the film.  In the movie, Nina auditions and wins the role of Swan Lake, regardless of the directors concern she can't play &#34;The Black Swan&#34; and the role overtakes her.  If you watch, everything from tone to the color of Nina's clothes throughout the film document her transformation and gives you an inside look at someone who becomes too obsessed with perfection
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Not sure what Collins was thinking when she wrote this final book but Catnis turns into the weakest character possible.  I can't imagine a worse way to end the series than the rushed and torn way this final book played out.  I read the first two books in a week.  This last one was a struggle and epic failure.  It was written too fast.  Shame on the publisher for not pushing Collins to write a stronger version of the finish.  It felt so forced/rushed to the end.  And the reader can't even sympathize with the deranged characters who basically stumble through the book in delusional stupors.  Pretty awful.  I can only hope the movie fixes the books mistakes.
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|Love the Avengers and all the superhero type movies.  Great action.Great fight scenes and pretty ladies. I would recommend this show.

B00EH0K9H8|2.0|Rating is for the disc and not the content as it was, unfortunately, unplayable.<br /><br />Upon insrting the disc I received a screen flicker then a black screen with audible audio.  My Onkyo TX-SR608 receiver displayed a &#34;Resolution Error&#34; message.  I then checked the disc specs and it showed a resolution of 570p/50.  This resolution is for PAL/SECAM broadcast and is counted as &#34;enhanced-definition television (EDTV).&#34;<br /><br />Hopefully this was a mispackaged disc and not a complete fiasco for North American territories.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book. The story was excellent and a good follow up to the shining. I always wondered what happened with little Danny Torrance. Did he grow up to be an alcoholic like his father? Did he lose his shining? What happened with Wendy  and Dick? So many questions. I'm glad that Steven king finally answered all these questions in this book.

B00DW1WR14|2.0|Im going to get straight to the point.  Ive been a Pearl Jam fan for a long time.  Most Pearl Jam albums have had some \\"filler\\" material on them.  It's unfortunate that so many reviewers on here are fanboy Pearl Jam fans where if the band released 12 tracks worth of traffic noises these same people would come on here with a review stating that \\"THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST THEY'VE EVER RELEASED!!! THEY JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER!!!\\".  It's hilarious in it's own sadness.<br /><br />Pearl Jam released great music up through Yield.  In Binaural, you started to see the band moving towards a folk rock type sound.  Backspacer was the epitome of this sound.  Backspacer was probably the worst album by far Pearl Jam has released.  It was so terrible that I dont even know if Pearl Jam could even make another album that bad.<br /><br />Lighting Bolt is a step in the right direction but......you still get a lot of that self-loathing folk rock crap in it.  We're not talking about great ballads such as Nothingman, Betterman, Nothing As It Seems, etc.  No, we're talking about more rubbish like Vedder's solo stuff.  Granted, this time around it seems like Vedder actually allowed the band to put their stamp on these songs because they are nowhere as dreadful as those songs on Backspacer but you can definitely tell that this is a different band.  If you've heard one solo Vedder song then you've heard them all.  Its the same kind of lyrics, instrumentation, etc. etc.<br /><br />The first three songs on the album are promising.  Another positive is that there's no political garbage on this album.  I get it Pearl Jam, you dont like republicans.  Enough already.  It gets old.  The beginning of the album reminded of Vitalogy.  From there, it starts to go downhill.  The actual song Lightning Bolt is generic and flat. It's difficult to listen to Vedder try to scream in this song.  In fact, for the first time I actually thought that Vedder was having trouble keeping melody. Vedder had one of the strongest voices of the 90s!  You can really hear the deterioration of Vedder's voice when he tries to scream.  Its hollow and it sounds like he's REALLY trying hard to make his voice do something that came naturally to him a decade ago.<br /><br />This album is average at best.  Some strong songs, alot of weak songs.  You can actually hear the old Pearl Jam in some points in this album but for the most part if you didnt like Backspacer or their \\"Self Titled\\" album then you probably wont like this one either.  Outside of the first couple of songs, the rest of the album repeats that same kind of style.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Something causes ordinary  humans to manifest super powers. These enhanced people are called Epics and they seem to be all bad, craving power and murdering humans to get what they want. The strongest and worst of the lot is a being called Steelheart who is seemingly invincible. David witnesses Steelheart murdering his father when he is eight and devotes his life to learning as much as he can about Epics and Steelheart in particular. His goal is to find Steelheart's weakness and destroy him. To do so he joins a group of rebels with diverse backgrounds and skills.<br /><br />Sanderson has struck pay dirt with this new and original tale. He once again proves why he has become the king of Sci - Fi and Fantasy.

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I usually have to listen a few times before I can be sure if I like a new CD.  Even though NIN is my favorite it still has to grow on me.  Not since &#34;The Fragile&#34; have I liked an album so quickly.  This may be somewhat due to the fact that I listened with headphones for a first play.  I never do that.  Anyway, this album is catchier than his other albums and almost pop like in its approach without being overly hook heavy like what is playing on most radio stations.  Also, there is less anger present as the vocals don't reach a screaming crescendo and they always did in the past.  I used to think that such climaxes were my favorite part of NIN and Trent's voice.  This album doesn't need such moments to shine.  He sings with greater confidence in melody with more notes and range used as the music remains just as beat heavy as always.  Finally, there are more songs that just 'groove' - as these types of songs of Trent's have always been among my favorites, not just the aggressive ones.  The whole album grooves as easily as any album by Prince or Michael Jackson, or even Bjork (3 other artists that dable in Industrial from time to time).  The lyrics even came with the Deluxe version.  That hasn't happened for his last few releases.  Overall, this is a great musician who has stood the test of time and re- imagined himself once again with honesty - honest talent, music, and words.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|In this post-Avengers Iron Man installment, we get to see a much more mature and emotionally-vulnerable Tony Stark, which should encourage all of us non-superheroes, as it seems that even the best and strongest have their bad days.  The action sequences build throughout the movie, all the while we are are given a deeper look into the thoughts, feelings, and inner motivations of each of the characters.  This movie thus falls into that rare category generally known as \\"intelligent sci-fi.\\"  Great storyline, with a few plot twists to keep you on your toes.  The special effects are absolutely mind-blowing on this disc...especially in Blu-Ray.  My one complaint:  we need more Gwynneth Paltrow.  She has the class and charisma to warrant more screen time.  The romance between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts has been steadily growing throughout the series, so I say it's time to let her be the Bacall to her Bogey.  A fun ride nonetheless.  Grab this one!
B00DYWKPAQ|1.0|This is lame, lousy arena rock.  The Kings of Leon used to be a good band.  They're not anymore.  I'm out.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I wrote a review already, but somehow it didn't \\"take.\\"  I'll keep this brief, and tell you that this movie strives to keep Roddenberry's vision alive of the original TV-series characters.  Every cast member has depth and believability, but the director could have gone further with them...especially Kirk. (Special effects seem to take precedence these days.) Bottom line...\\"Into Darkness\\" has a winning formula of action, suspense, drama, and a nice dose of wit.  I would say that it is even better than Star Trek.  The action sequences are some of the best I have seen in a sci-fi action adventure film.  This is a must-have for your collection.  Get it on Blu-Ray, by all means.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Honestly, I've never read a romance novel due to the simple fact that I prefer the worlds of science fiction and fantasy, in which I can become lost and immersed in a world not here. Despite this, I picked up A Fault in Our Stars because of my admiration for the author, along with the praise given to the book from friends. The book immediately caught my attention, so I finished it in two sittings, split only because of school. The ideas held in the book struck a chord within me, and I came to see it not (like my sister defines it) as a romance novel, but rather a book revealing the pain of life and fate in ways I found helpful. It is a marvelous world and I personally believe that the majority of people will connect with it deeply on an emotional and personal level.
B008QDCZ7E|3.0|The Norah Jones catalog is being remastered for SACD.  Generally, I would say that's a good thing, as about 60% of my CD collection consists of SACDs or other high-rez audio formats.  I decided to spring for the SACD version of Feels Like Home, which is WAY expensive here (I paid almost $45).  It's cheaper at Music Direct, Elusive Disc, etc.  I already owned (and will keep) the Deluxe Edition of this disc, which contains several bonus tracks and a DVD with six songs.  That edition is a MUCH better value...I give it five stars for sound quality and value.  The three-star rating here is for the SACD version, which, as noted, is pricey.  It is only marginally better sonically to the Deluxe Edition 2-disc set.  By all means, grab the non-SACD Deluxe Edition if you can still get it.  To my ears, the SACD version has more detail, but is also tipped toward the edgy side in the upper mids / lower treble.  Perhaps that brightness is due to the master tape;  I have no way of knowing for certain.  I haven't heard the \\"standard\\" edition disc, but I'm sure the sound quality is the same as the double-disc set...just without any extras.  I may spring for the other Norah Jones discs in SACD, but as of yet I'm undecided.  I hope this review helps you make the right buying decision.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Lots of pieces, but well worth the end result. Can't wait to get the other kits to add on to this one!
B007SVPZMW|5.0|This app is perfect for kids. It's beautiful and the animation is fantastic. To rate this game low because it's for kids does nothing. The app itself is fine.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It streams Netflix and YouTube perfectly, from any device, but I thought I could broadcast my pics and vids from my iPad, but apparently it's only for streaming specific apps, like the ones mentioned above.  (I would like to stream my GoPro Vids and video taken with iPhone and iPad.).  Maybe an app for that will be put out someday.  I still recommend this to be able to broadcasts on anybody's tv. It's great!

B008Y768XO|5.0|This movie was like watching Mug grow up all over again. We lost her a couple of years ago at age 16, so I cried through a lot of the movie because she looked almost exactly like Hachi. What a beautiful movie. A tear-jerker, but I will watch it again.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|My husband and I first saw the 3-D version in the theater. We loved it!  Now I ordered the DVD for our home view. I am very pleased with it. The clarity was excellent. The audio was also excellent. We loved the action and the emotional  upheavals felt in the storyline. The movie was great but one thing I was disappointed about was there were no extra features added to the menu.  Wanda
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I rarely get caught up playing games on my kindle, but this one is perfect because I can pause anytime and pick up right where I left off. It presents a challenge because the tiles look similar but after a few games, I find myself getting better and better and looking forward to beating my previous time. Never boring, love it.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I tried resisting this book for a while since I'm not a huge thriller/crime novel type but curiosity got the best of me.  In the beginning, I loved this book.  From how the book was written to how the characters were described with the different POV of the husband/wife, this book could do no wrong.  It was such a good read and I couldn't put it down.  Then you get towards the end... and everything goes to ****.  Really, I mean it.  It's like watching a show that used to be good for the first couple of seasons and then the writers start complicating things in order for it to be exciting and new but all it really does it make it messy.  Then to end  the series finale they have to make it even more ridiculous so they can cover their butts with all the crap they've filled it with.  Well the ending is like that.  Flynn was doing so well with her characters and then literally just trashed them.  I almost wish she would have just ended it in the middle rather than trying to make some sort of &#34;ending&#34; that made sense.  Really, it's like reading a bad soap opera without all the racy goodness to go with it.  Still giving it 3 stars because I really liked the beginning and I really felt like it could have gone somewhere.  Those of you that gave it 5 stars are probably just sociopaths (kidding, but kind of not really).
B00ESLTNR8|2.0|The book was ok but boring for a lot of it. It would have an short exciting part then a long boring one then a short good then a long boring one.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|As often happens with sequels, I did not feel that this book lived up to the potential of the first one, The Selection. I raced through it in a few hours because I needed to know what happened (which I suppose is a positive thing), but from early on I was constantly highlighting and making notes in my Kindle about various annoying, contradictory things America would do or say. I could not STAND her in this book.<br /><br />I don't think I can write this review without spoilers, so ...there's your warning. THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br /><br />America is all over the place. She'll forget about Aspen for weeks on end, then Maxon does something to upset her (i.e. he is complicit in the public torturing of Marlee), something so bad she swears she's quitting the competition and can have nothing to do with the royal family anymore, and suddenly she's remembering that Aspen is \\"the one constant\\" in her life and decides to enjoy a steamy make-out session with him. Then a few days later, Maxon will do something utterly mundane like give her a blue bracelet and that stupid gesture changes everything again. A direct quote after she gets the bracelet: \\"And there it was, pushing up through all the worries: hope.\\" I think it was probably that line where I officially started hating this series. A bracelet gives you hope?? He's already given her so much; I don't understand why one stupid trinket is enough to make up for all her concerns.<br /><br />Maxon was also infuriating and inconsistent. He says he understands that he needs to regain America's trust after that whole torture escapade, but then grows frustrated with her for not being able to decide whether to marry him or not (a frustration I shared, but for different reasons). When she tells him she still can't decide about 3/4 of the way through the book, he responds:<br /><br />\\"That's not acceptable. I need an answer. Because I can't send someone who really wants this--who wants me--home if you're going to bail out in the end.\\"<br /><br />Excuse me, what? Am I the only one who remembers him telling her at the beginning of book 1, as soon as they become friends, that he'll let her stay until the very end, until it's narrowed down to just two people, if that's what she wants? But no, suddenly she's playing him and being selfish and behaving \\"unacceptably\\" - never mind that he's playing every girl in the Selection every second this ridiculous competition goes on. Humph!<br /><br />Then she catches him making out with Celeste and all the doubts come rushing back, he's horrible, he's a traitor, he can't be trusted, he's just like that slimebucket Gregory Ill&eacute;a! She's so fed up she decides to drop out of the competition, but not before going out with a bang. The Celeste thing inspires her to do the first actually decisive and brave thing (other than when she rushed to support Marlee in the torture scene) in this entire series: she goes on the Capital Report and proclaims that the caste system should be abolished. She opines constantly in the pages before doing this about how she knows it is an unforgivable thing she's doing and will result in her getting kicked out of the Selection. She knows what the consequences will be, but says she doesn't care and doesn't want to win anymore anyway: what matters is standing up for what she believes in!<br /><br />So it provoked a major eye roll in this reader when, after everyone reacted to her presentation exactly as she predicted, and Maxon says she has to leave, she immediately begins apologizing and begging for him to forgive her.<br />\\"Maxon.\\" The quiet plea in my voice made him look at me. \\"I'm so sorry. I was mad, and I wanted to . . . I don't even know anymore.\\"<br />You don't even know anymore? Let me do you a favor and scroll back about five pages to the passage where you discuss your motivations at length!<br />He and Celeste were so much alike. Everything about them was a show. And I knew that he would spend the rest of his life sweet-talking the public into thinking he was wonderful, all the while keeping them trapped where they were. Just like Gregory.<br /><br />\\"I sat down on my floor, legs crossed under my nightgown. As upset as I was with Maxon, I was even more upset with myself. I should have fought harder. I should have done more. I shouldn't be sitting here so defeated.<br />I wiped the tears away and assessed the situation. I was done with Maxon, but I was still here. I was done with the competition, but I still had a presentation due. . . . I wasn't here to win anymore. So how could I go out with a bang?<br />Nothing about the Celeste situation, which provoked her to drop out of the competition and \\"go out with a bang\\" is resolved between this section and when she actually does go out with a bang, and yet as soon as it happens she is begging Maxon to forgive her.

Come on!!! This is clearly the key to everything, why don't you just sit still for a few hours and finish it!?!<br /><br />But the most disgusting moment of all occurs after the rebel attack at the end of the book. The rebels attack and it is the bloodiest attack so far in the series...America sees a guard get shot in the chest and start bleeding out right in front of her before Maxon whisks her away to safety. She remarks, \\"I tried to slow my breathing and erase what I'd just seen from my mind.\\"<br /><br />Happily, she has no problem \\"erasing\\" it from her mind as she spends the next few hours canoodling with Maxon (whom she hated about 2 hours earlier). Not once do they pause to consider how many more people might be getting murdered every minute that passes as they sit comfortably in safety, talking about relationship woes.<br /><br />The culmination of this selfishness occurs after they get out and are informed that 25 guards were killed in the attack. Only then does America think of Aspen:<br /><br />\\"I prayed that he was safe. I'd been so consumed last night, it hadn't occurred to me to worry.\\"<br /><br />Is this not the epitome of selfishness?? She saw bullets whizzing and a guard get shot in the chest just before she is taken to safety, and it didn't occur to her to worry about Aspen, or even her maids, her precious maids whom she constantly prides herself on being so nice to and treating like equals. Instead, she can only think of herself, her confused feelings for Maxon, her feelings on being a princess, HER HER HER. Speaking out publicly against the castes is one of the few times she does something brave and unselfish, but she takes it back the minute it happens because, selfishly, she's worried Maxon won't want her anymore.<br /><br />At the point when she declared herself \\"too consumed\\" to worry whether Aspen had been slaughtered during the night, I let go of whatever lingering hope I had that she would come to her senses and pick Aspen. I now hope she winds up with Maxon, because I think they deserve each other. Aspen certainly deserves a lot better, and I have a hunch Lucy is after him, so maybe that will work out. I don't think I'll be reading the final book though so someone will have to let me know what happens.<br /><br />The one good thing I can say is that I did race through the book wanting to find out what happens. It was very suspenseful and often action packed.the public into thinking he was wonderful, all the while keeping them trapped where they were. Just like Gregory.<br /><br />\\"I sat down on my floor, legs crossed under my nightgown. As upset as I was with Maxon, I was even more upset with myself. I should have fought harder. I should have done more. I shouldn't be sitting here so defeated.<br />I wiped the tears away and assessed the situation. I was done with Maxon, but I was still here.

B009PK9SB8|4.0|This is a great product, but be aware that GoPro does not yet have LCD touch bacpac backdoors that fit the Hero3+ housing. I purchased the Hero3+ Black camera and the LCD Touch BacPac here. The LCD screen works great on the Hero3+, but you can't CLOSE and FASTEN any of the backdoors that come with the LCD Touch Bacpac/screen. I called GoPro, and they said I have caught them in the middle of a product transition. They do not yet make backdoors to fit the Hero3+ housing. So they are sending me a free housing for the Hero 3 (without the plus). They say my Hero3+ camera and backpack will fit and work fine in the Hero 3 housing, and then the LCD bacpac's backdoors will close/fasten. In the meantime, my workaround is a couple of rubber bands to hold the Hero3+ camera and backpack in the housing in order to mount the camera on the many mounts (headstrap, dashboard mount, handlebar mount, etc) I have purchased. I just can't use it in the water untilI get my new, free housing.

0142410705|3.0|My first experience reading a John Green novel was the well-loved The Fault In Our Stars. It was such a fabulous book that I ran out and bought Looking For Alaska which I also loved. So the next time I made a book purchase, I ended up buying all the remaining John Green books which I have not read, and chose to read this one first. Mostly because it seemed to be getting the worst reviews and I figured if it's really not as good as people are saying it is, may as well read it now and get it over with. But before starting I was still in denial, SURELY I'll like it!<br /><br />And I did. But I went into it with very high expectations I think, being that my first two John Green reads were phenomenal. So this book felt very lackluster in comparison. It held my attention well enough to get me to finish it, but not well enough that I'd recommend and/or re-read it. The plot just wasn't nearly as engaging, nothing major happened that really grabbed at my attention, and although previously I loved John Green's humor, this didn't felt as funny. Yes there were funny bits, but it just wasn't as entertaining. Also I wasn't particularly a fan of any of the characters except for Hassan.<br /><br />I'm not exactly disappointed in the novel, but I'm not thrilled with it either. I guess I just don't have strong feelings one way or another for it. Oh, mediocre, that's the word I was looking for. It was a mediocre novel.

B0053O89Z6|4.0|I used to love this series, but it's kind of getting old. But I continue to watch because I love Barney and am curious to see who the mom is. Overall I'd say if you like the show, this product is worth it but consider looking at Target or Best Buy when they have a sale.
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|Nice sleek phone case that looks nice an well made.  It works well with the new iphone 5s. It doesn't interfere with the camera.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|So many shows start strong and grow stale three or four seasons in.  Castle delivers week after week, even in season five.  The romance between Castle and Beckett has been beautifully and naturally moved along.  Episodes featuring supporting cast, such as The Wild Rover with Seamus Dever, are every bit as high quality and entertaining as those with the main characters in the driver's seat.  Not to be missed from season 5:  &#34;Murder, He Wrote&#34; with a spectacular visit to Castle's house in the Hamptons; &#34;Final Frontier&#34; ComicCon spoof with a slew of fun sci fi allusions; &#34;Target/Hunt&#34; kidnapping episodes with some of the finest dramatic acting I've ever seen; and &#34;The Lives of Others (100th episode,) which is a wonderfully surprising Hitchcock tribute. It just gets better and better.
B00F0N7JUG|3.0|*Collector's Edition Review* I was definitely buying this collector's edition no matter what and I love the movie, but after opening the contents I discovered that the disks are stacked on top of each other instead of being placed on their own holding space. They are on the back of the Gipsy Danger plastic sculpture held in a small flip-down section all stacked on top of each other. They could have done a much better job in preventing the discs from touching one another/scratching but oh well, they'll never learn.<br /><br />No comment on the special futures yet, I will update once I check them out.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This is a really good, beautifully filmed, interesting take on a classic.  Luhrman takes some liberty with the plot but sticks almost exclusively to the text for the spoken lines, which works great.  Don't expect a completely faithful movie version of the book--for that, you're better off with the Robert Redford version.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|the book changes my life .I recommended this book to those who feels like they had nothing but their own aching soul
0670024856|4.0|Throughout the week, Signature of All Things determined my everyday mood with its dramatically changing tone in every chapter. It has a heroine like Alma, who with a mind for math, heart for plants and yearning for courtship, never steps out of her mansion for half a century and later, sets out to travel across the world fighting agedness. When Henry Whittaker, the heroine's father, travels around the world, there is a subtle shade of Yann MArtel's 'Life of Pi' that runs through his sailing experience. When Alma deals with her feelings for a botanist and confronts her sister, we see Jane Austen in her lucid might.<br />The book has geography, history and orchids. And it has mosses. Mosses that were just an annoying patch of green. Mosses that now look, to me, divine. Yet Elizabeth Gilbert﻿ disappoints at few places when religious conversion is painted with a glorious Western perspective. But that is completely understandable, given the fact that author (despite her New Age-ish Eat, Pray Love) and the heroine are gloriously Western.<br />The book is nothing of Eat, Pray, Love but intriguing in a way of its own.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I got this game because I finished the other same like game and I ran out of challenges. I liked them both, they just ran out too fast..<br />but overall I like the games. Make the games have more, longer challenges and the games will last longer...

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This newest installment to the Downton Abbey show was great.  The characters seem more developed and the story progresses in time.  A few surprises (not going make a spoiler here) in the story line as it twists and turns to establishing a new regime of characters. Just a great show all around.

1476729085|4.0|Graeme Simsion’s THE ROSIE PROJECT is a romantic comedy about an unusually specific man, but it still manages to be universal as it deals with the contradictions of being human. Don Tillman, like many of us, is observant about other people, but fails to have basic insights about himself. He, also like many of us, says he wants one quite specific thing, but when presented with reality, he wants something entirely different.<br /><br />Don is a genetics professor who cooks, works out, and acquires and masters new skills quickly. He is also single, due mostly to his lack of social skills. In fact, he has never had a second date. As the narrator, Don gives us an inside look at his orderly, efficient view of the world and its inhabitants. However, the reader quickly makes observations about Don that he cannot make himself. For instance, while giving a lecture about Asperger’s syndrome, he is describing himself without ever realizing it.<br /><br />The plot sets in motion shortly after this, when he decides to embark on the Wife Project, a questionnaire he creates and then refines to find the perfect wife. She must work out but not be concerned with her looks. No smokers. No vegetarians. No picky eaters of any kind. He’s looking for someone logical and orderly to fit neatly into his meticulous world.<br /><br />His married friends Gene and Claudia decide to throw in a “wild card” submission named Rosie, who is on her own search as well. Having been raised by her disappointing stepfather Phil after her mother died, Rosie has never met her actual father. She knows he is a former classmate of her mother’s from a drunken graduation night celebration. Rosie is, of course, all wrong for Don: a vegetarian smoker bartender who is usually running late and wearing makeup. Don quickly rules her out as a potential wife, but finds himself inclined to help her in her own search, the Father Project, though he is unable to articulate why.<br /><br />From there, THE ROSIE PROJECT develops these two characters and provides the reader with several hilarious scenes of awkward social encounters and failed amateur espionage. Among these is a gem where he fails to realize Rosie works at a gay bar.<br /><br />Don, with the aid of those around him, gradually learns that logic, order and efficiency have little to do with human relationships, romantic or otherwise. He begins to empathize with his friends and see their marriage is struggling. He is able to discern facts about Phil and Rosie’s relationship that she is not. The reader, however, stays two steps ahead of Don throughout the novel, watching him come to terms with the world around him as we all have to do from time to time.<br /><br />Simsion has created a strong, singular and consistent voice. Rather than alienating the reader, he manages to use Don to exaggerate qualities that lie in all of us. Everyone struggles to relate to the outside world, see themselves as they really are, and accept what it is that we really want. Don has those qualities in spades, which makes him more human than most and his journey all the more satisfying.<br /><br />Reviewed by Josh Mallory

0316204366|5.0|It is difficult to get away from Malcolm Gladwell these days. A Sunday morning interview on NPR, a cover story for Costco Connection, a podcast on jimromenesko.com (“I am everything I once despised”) and a critical look at his work in October’s Slate are just a few recent appearances.<br /><br />His latest book, DAVID AND GOLIATH, is a collection of events with scientific, philosophical and cultural bents. The introduction begins with a retelling of a favorite Biblical story, David and Goliath, but he then asserts that we have been getting it all wrong for hundreds of years. David was not supposed to win because he was too small, inexperienced and vulnerable. The implication, of course, is that we continue to make wrong assumptions based on traditional criteria for success. We learn that David was prepared, ready to go with underdog armor, and we were not looking for that. Gladwell forces us to consider that the effects of deprivation, disabilities, orphanhood, poverty and great fear strengthen us and prepare us for previously unimagined victories and successes.<br /><br />Part One gives the advantages and disadvantages of having too much. Gladwell poses the questions about whether or not class sizes can be too small, and whether or not parents can have too much money for successful parenting. He details the Impressionists’ decision in Paris in the 1860s to reject the fabulously selective and important contests and exhibitions in the Salon (the Big Pond). Manet, Monet, Renoir and other painters struggled to win acceptance and be “Little Fish in the Big Pond.” Then they opted to stay away from the prized exhibition and create their own showcase. They became “Big Fish in a Little Pond” and instead displayed their own work privately. We know how that decision turned out for them.<br /><br />Part Two points out the necessity (desirability, Gladwell calls it) of difficulty. He cites Martin Luther King Jr. and the marchers in Birmingham, Alabama in the 1960s as overwhelming underdogs. However, King’s advantage was paradoxical; he was from “a community that had always been the underdog.” The disadvantages of being outnumbered and out-powered for hundreds of years gave the civil rights leaders other skills. Wyatt Walker, one of King’s closest allies, was never photographed with King and therefore kept his connection private. He also managed to have the media show the Birmingham police hundreds of black marchers; the numbers looked impressive. In reality, there were only handfuls of blacks at first; the “difficulty” of being the underdog, one who is indistinguishable from another one of your color, worked to their benefit. The national coverage (even though inaccurately recorded in photographs and newspaper accounts) was a turning point in the civil rights movement. Gladwell lays out for readers the brilliance of underdog thinking.<br /><br />Part Three addresses the limits of power. The most striking example is the difference in the management of grief shown by two families, who each lost a daughter to murder. One mother found the strength through her Mennonite background to forgive the murderer and save her own friendships and happiness. But the father of the other murdered child enlisted the state of California’s legal system and almost single-handedly created the Three Strikes law, which was a dramatic yet fruitless experiment. Gladwell furthers this idea by showing other scenarios where limiting authority succeeds: protection of Jews in France during World War II, elementary classroom situations, and 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.<br /><br />One of the most uplifting stories was about the Blitz of London during WWII. Traditional wisdom had the Brits fleeing the city, going crazy, and turning on one another. In reality, the survivors (Gladwell calls them the “remote misses”) became a citizenry who were more courageous than they had ever been before. Courage is what you have when you’vebeen through tough times and discover they aren’t so tough after all.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell’s reliable voice and easy manner tell uneasy stories about extraordinary successes that prove his point about actual outcomes, not expected outcomes. His perspective --- sometimes humorous, other times quietly serious --- challenges us to be more critical and observant in our own lives.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jane Krebs
B0002HZSE4|5.0|This horse is cute, well made, realistically rendered, and the coloring is striking and unusual. I was inspired to get it because someone on one of the threads on the forum here on Amazon was talking about horses, and put on a link to this one, and because I am writing a story in which the main character has a horse. Anyway, I liked it, so I got it. I like it even more now that I have it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something like it. I would only add that I was a little disappointed in the packaging. I thought it would come in a nice box, but it was only in a plastic bag inside the paper mailing envelope. I wasn't going to add this comment here, but I decided to since I noticed that another reviewer mentioned the packaging.

There is an elevated consciousness when you can let go and immerse yourself in the music, much like meditation, and a real connection to that Devine spirit.

B004SIP9MY|3.0|I've watched this movie many times and still don't understand what all the fuss is about.  It's a slasher flick.  Just because it supposedly parodies the genre doesn't elevate it above the genre.  It still uses the exact same elements in the same manner as the rest.  A wink and nod to the camera, assuring us of its self-awareness, doesn't alter the fact, it's still just a slasher flick, no better or worse than the rest.  Employing a cast of elderly \\"teens\\" is par for the course.  The number of victims is actually quite low.  The costume is silly, not scary.  The number of red herrings is limited to four and of the four; the most obvious is under the mask.  The harassed victim (Neve Campbell) is just as ineffectual as every other harassed victim, it's a key element they didn't bother to change or update.  Bad acting abounds (primarily Matthew Lillard and his tongue).  How it got to be the highest grossing slasher flick of all time is beyond me.<br />As I stated, I've watched Scream many times, I will continue to watch it.  It's in my collection but it's definitely not one of my favorites.  As far as the scare factor goes, it's practically nil.  The problem with trying to appear glib and hip is that you risk watering down all that is expected in a slasher flick, replacing it with unwarranted humor instead.  That makes this one about as tame as they come.

B000RLFJQ2|4.0|Good fast action plot.  A real sleeper if you go by the title only.  Robert DeNiro is very good.  View it.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Does`not work with IOS devices. The app on the apple store to make it work doesn´t exist. Waste my time and my money.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was my 2nd Jack Reacher book and I loved it! It was also my 2nd audio book that I am taken by while traveling to and from work.  We are introduced to Jack as he gets off the bus in a small town Margrave and within hours is arrested for murder! In the arrest he meets Finley the detective on the case and it comes out that Jack is a military brat and has just finished up in the service and has been just passing thru places the last 6 mos.  They find out jack didnt do it b/c the guy that is murdered is a fed and turns out to be his brother! The book takes you thru jack beating the crap out of some people and who all the small town players come to be and why. He meets Rosco whom he falls in love with just about minutes after meeting her! Jack likes you or he doesnt! It was quick and to the point and I will definitely be reading more.  The first Jack Reacher I read was actually #18 that I recently won on GoodReads and I had to go back and start at the beginning b/c I liked it that well. Jack doesnt stay around anyone place for long I have learned. I will eventally read them all.  I definitely recommend this book solid 4*! Keep em coming Mr. Child!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We waited until the entire series was complete to be able to watch them. This collection is perfect! Includes all the movies and is in a compact case so you aren't using a whole shelf just for it. Also a great price!
B000W91RUG|5.0|my friend turned me onto big bang last year and ive seen some early episodes but i wanted to start from the beginning so i now own 1-4 and am watching with some much excitement it arrived on time and in one piece what more could i ask for.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like the way it works with all the little extras. Love the game and glad to have found it since am not really all that techno minded.
B004V9MU86|4.0|I loved how this book was structured and built the story along the way. It is really unique in the way that it doesn't hold information from the reader whilst building exactly the right amount of tension and forcing the reader on, I couldn't put it down. As a book set at the time of the Holocaust you expect a gloom and there was a sense of that but at the same time a wonderful sense of hope and goodness. Definitely a book I would recommend to everyone.
1594484805|4.0|Daniel Pink's A Whole New Mind made an enormous impact and Drive is a very interesting followup.  Pink makes a strong case for autonomy, mastery, and purpose in the workplace and in education, turning away from traditional management approaches (e.g. carrot and stick), and turning away from traditional approaches to education.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, although Drive is valuable, it does seem a little padded.  That being said, there is more depth here than in Pink's excellent TED Talk, and the supplementary and synopsis material at the end of Drive offers some value when a reader needs a quick review of the concepts.  Highly recommended, particularly if the price is right.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When you pick up this book it's difficult to put it back down again! Very we'll written story with deep characters and an amazing plot that gives you stuff to think about!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is loads of fun,for me and the kids. If your deciding whether to get it or not, the answers yes!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great illustration of how one's life can  change course with one decision! The characters seemed disconnected initially but become interwoven quickly. However I doubt the ending. Once the characters connected I couldn't put it down!
1932100660|5.0|Ever wonder why some diseases such as heart disease and breast cancer are almost non-existent in some countries? T. Colin Campbell serves up the answer in The China Study.
B00F56AZK4|1.0|Lame trial version compares poorly to other jigsaw puzzle games; tiny puzzle box is even worse; all in all, pretty weak.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The only complaint I have is that when you post a status you can't put how you're feeling like on the actual Facebook website or some other Facebook apps I've seen my friends have on their phones.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|this seems to be quite true to the comic book. more so than most film adaptations. I got the feeling the film-maker respected the source material. im not an expert on comicbooks or film, that's just my initial response. Of the bit of watchmen i did read, i recognized in movie scenes that where visually verbatim.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Brian K. Vaughan proves that he is consistent with his success. Another off the charts series with characters you right away invest in, and a story that promises to deliver.<br />Certainly seeing this one to the end.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I really like the tech design concepts in this movie. But I think there are plot holes in the story that stop me from recommending it.
140006922X|5.0|Excellent book. It provides a historical background for the political, economic, religious and social events of the time. It adds lots of other layers to the narrative of Jesus' life that is not clearly covered in the Bible. It's much more of a historical look at the times than any provided by religious doctrine.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I love the characters!  I love the stories!  This series is the best!  I've only got one more book.  Please write some more.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|What a pleasant surprise. One of the funniest movies in a long time. Laughed out loud many times. Well worth the money to buy.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Enjoying the interactive nature of this 2013 revision of the New World Translation..True joy to read! looking forward to future updates.
0061537969|5.0|I buy this book for people that are ill.  It is a great story.  It is difficult to find people who have not read this book already, but when I do, I know that the reader will be delighted.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I read Gone  Girl first, which was very good. That lead me to other Flynn novels. Unfortunately, Dark Places and Sharp Objects were no where near as good. I highly recommend Gone Girl, but you will be disappointed in Flynn`s other work if you read it first.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|...but this is at least in the running.  I need a few more months with it to say, but thus far it's pretty awesome.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, Alter Bridge has put out several of the best &#34;mainstream&#34; hard rock/metal CDs of the past 10 years.  I mostly listen to progressive rock and prog-metal (ie. Dream Theater, Symphony X, Seventh Wonder, Haken, Enchant, etc), so AB is a little outside of my &#34;normal&#34; tastes...but damn, when it's this good, it's this good!<br /><br />Favorite tracks thus far are &#34;Bleed It Dry,&#34; &#34;All Ends Well,&#34; and the title track &#34;Fortress.&#34;  However, in my half-dozen listens, there isn't a bad or even &#34;weak&#34; track on it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00867HDTA|3.0|Way to short of a game but still fun. I love the defenders. Without them it is really, really easy
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Just picked up the movie Pacific Rim today. And it was nice to watch the movie after I had listened to the soundtrack several times. It was most enjoyable that way
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love it the game is better than minecraft so fun you make animals and Gish I am building a huge place that goes every were
B00881VLCE|5.0|love working puzzles. The add on all the time are what I really love to work and being able to change the number of pieces.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|For $10 this sharpener is a good value. It is good for tuning up knives. I have not put it on extremely dull knives but it does not seem to be able to get knives as sharp as a professional. That being said I think it is a good affordable way to maintain knives.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman does it again! I've been a fan of his work since I read American Gods. This story, while nothing like that book, managed to wrap me up with its beautiful imagery and storyline. I simply could not stop reading. Its a grown-up take on a fairy-tale; complete with magic, far-off lands and even a monster.  My only gripe with this would be that the main character is rather passive; simly letting the story unfold around him without acting too much on his own. But overall, I enjoyed it. Definitely worth a read.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|I paid for this on my Kindle and I have yet to see it downloaded--what gives?! Don't have time to be scouring the web site to get this resolved. If your prompted to try something on the device you're using at the time, then one assumes you're downloading onto the device at the time...
B006YC74E8|1.0|I didn't like how I had to use my internet/data plan just to use this app. I got it in hopes of not having to use data
B00594XOZU|4.0|I used to use kik a lot and still do one day I needed to log on it was working greatly before then I tried to log in I waited and it said try again in a bit so I did it didn't work then I thought many my kindle is screwed up so I reset it nothing I deleted it multiple times it needs to be fix I moved and can't talk to my friends
0887081770|1.0|Received correct tittle of book but book was very small my daughter can't use it. I understand that the size of the book is not the sellers fault. But as I was emailing the seller all he wanted was for me to remove my negative feedback he didn't want to help me. I asked him several times if he had this same book tittle but in a bigger version I never got an answer. Few days went by nothing asked about returning item as my daughter would ruin it the first time she were to look at it no response. Worse experience I've had with any seller.
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|The man is a legend.  This is a great new album.  There isn't a bad song or weak link on the album.
B0035KGWR2|5.0|How she cannot be a top performer in America eludes me. 5 Stars for this CD and all of her other works.
B005V2S7FW|2.0|So far after about 90 days of use ithas been more trouble than it's worth. I was told I could make my accounts more secure with automatically generated random passwords which sounded promising, but thus far there have been more instances when I have been unable to get into an account with an updated password because I've changed devices, than of instances where it has been helpful.<br />For instance my employer makes us change passwords periodically but it doesn't auto update if you do something like that. In another case when I got locked out of an account, called the company and got the screen to create a new password (where you have to type it twice) it now fills in my password twice instead of my ID and password in the two fields that open the site. This is especially annoying on this site because I am constantly getting locked out if Lastpass logs me in incorrectly.<br />I paid for the deluxe version but it only shows as basic free on every device I use it on.<br />It doesn't work properly on Kindle. When I am logged in to Lastpass and ask to go to one of the saved accounts, it just takes me to the sign in page, it doesn't fill it in. Again, with the randomly generated passwords that were the selling point, that leaves me stranded. At least before with my &#34;less secure&#34; passwords I could remember my older uncles maiden name or whatever, now I am at a loss and locked out.<br /><br />So far I would say LOTS OF EXTRA LOGGING IN AND MORE ACCOUNTS I CAN'T GET INTO. SOrry I downloaded it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Enjoyable sci fi even if a bit predictable. Characters are fun if a little stereotyped. Worth the watch if not outstanding.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Mind challenging and fun!  Haven't tried other Spider games yet, but will. Need to try for yourself and get a feel for it too!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show should be started at the beginning. Lots of character relationships puzzles on going throughout the show. Keeps you interested. Just finished season 1, will be watching all, so for now on to season 2.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Also a favorite of mine with mind challenges and hints. Don't expect to win every time, it's in the cards!
B0007MAJBQ|5.0|These days, mini discs are considered obsolete but they are still one of the best way to record and edit music.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Just okay. Some funny parts, but modern-day sayings and phrases didn't mesh with the alleged time period. More eye-rolling than actual lol moments.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I read the book and of course the movie did not live up to the book, but it was good anyway. It was fun to see how everything was represented and how it compared with how I imagined it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is so cool.it is much better than all the other hunting games.I strongly recommend you to give it a try.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really enjoiyed this book.  I like books that take you through many years and multi generations.  It was an easy read and it kept me interested.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is very addicting. I would recommend to any puzzle solvers .<br />This game is very good at wasting time if needed or wanting for a challage also
B00280LYHS|5.0|I'm just amazed with this book. It has a great ending!<br /><br />It is awesome!<br /><br />These are some of the best books I've ever read!
B003VANOFY|2.0|It was a great wireless headset at first, but after a good while it became a pain. The battery went to crap, it wouldn't charge even though it was plugged in and it would cut in and out when ever it felt like it while it was plugged in. Pretty sure it has something to do with the usb port on the headset getting loose over time. It's alright if you got money to spend on something that will not last too long, but I would rather recommend the Logitech G35. It's the same headset it's just wired.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|This bulb is actually brighter than the generic 60w incandescent bulb it replaces. It's a great energy saving and low heating. Remains to be seen whether it will stand the test of time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Been awhile since I'd read one of his books.  Love the take off on &#34;The Shining&#34;--a classic. A real &#34;page-swiper&#34; (on my kindle)
1455502758|5.0|Love all his work......Love people who are not afraid to speak outside the norm!!! Thanks Christopher for sharing your gifts with us.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I have daughters that are 3 and 11. They both loved this movie. It is very cute and funny, even for adults.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|We are all connected in some way. The heart and soul are so strong. They live eternally. No physical distance can surpass that strength.<br />Mr Hosseini has captured that essence with perfectly descriptive emotional detail.<br />Jumping timeframes and characters were a bit confusing, and took a page or two to figure out who was speaking and where they were.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The attempt to avoid mental more than physooicoal errant behaviour with the use of eroticism.  The description of the main characters helps overcome the above initially.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|I enjoyed this old movie.  A change of pace from reality tv.  Love Cary grant movies,. Recommend for family as well.
0316228583|2.0|Dreary and, after slogging through it all, rather uninspiring. It's difficult to connect with the stereotypical characters. I usually enjoy Brit Lit, but I couldn't wait for this one to be over. Didn't care for the HP series either. The writing in both is very one dimensional.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I used to have this game on my computer. So glad to have it on my kindle now!  gonna be great for my upcoming road trip.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A good challange. that makes you think. Looking forward to more puzzles. Family time we worked on the puzzles together
B004YRSBTW|4.0|I liked the creative way that this story is told in bits and pieces.  It keeps you thinking throughout, and the short-term memory problem of the main character makes for some interesting situations throughout as he tries to solve a mystery.  Definitely worth a watch.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use.  Just the sort of thing I was looking for without having to buy an alarm clock! Just one more great way t use my kindle
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Good writing style , some humor, some intrigue, some action, all wrapped up in an easy-to-read  book. For mystery seekers and cryptologists alike, twists, turns and of course a surprise ending that I can't imagine anybody can figure out until the last few pages.
B00C6BB2JE|5.0|Loved the look of the werewolfs and vampires they looked just like how I pictured werewolfs and vampires to be. The main fight sence between van hellsing and Dracula was amazing wish it was longer thought.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This novel was so gripping I could not put it down. I does have some bad language, but it threw reality into the story. It was like the woman's conscience was trying to tell her what was true, but there was so much darkness that she could hardly see or rust herself.  Good ending!
B005PK56TA|4.0|the American Horror Story this captivating and most interesting I loved every moment of watching it.I can't wait to see season 2 of the American Horror Story.
1401201911|5.0|I had to ship it to an odd place, and it arrived well within the expected time. The recipient loved the story and the different perspective on Superman. I had read the book previously and enjoyed a look at a communist Man of Steel.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Really enjoyed !! Working nights was a easy read, to pick up an put down but remember where you where in the book !! Action packed with a good story line !! Thanks Mr Lee for helping me pass the time !!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this series. The books are very good and entertaining loved it once again. Can not wait to read the next book.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I had a really hard time getting into the book.  I kept getting the people and places confused.  I probably read 52% of the book before I thought I knew who everyone was and who was connected to whom.  I would not recommend this book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game. would recommend for anyone with a little one. great graphics no issues. plus it is free. always a plus
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Over the last year I have been hearing so many mixed reviews about this book, but one thing is certain; almost every woman I have spoken to has read this book, and everyone seems to have their own analysis of the characters and the book as a whole. So here is my opinion; I liked it, it's worth buying. There were times I couldn't put the book down, and other times I had to force myself to read through passages. At times, I could literally feel the main characters pain, passion, confusion, and intensity. Although, there were also many times I wondered how much longer is it going take to finish this book?! That's why I give this book only three stars. I'm curious as to what the next book in the series will be like. To each there own! Definitely something you can chatter about with your friends who have already read the book!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I love it!  I would highly recommend to anyone who loves picross or puzzle games.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I loved the story. What riveted me most of all was the closing defense of science against cargo cult imitation science. This should be required reading.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This app was one of my daughters favorites so I upgraded to the paid version. Definitely worth the $1.99 because it had provided hours of fun while still providing lots of learning opportunity.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|Great movie!!!!!!! I really loved it.  Star trek the movie and show is great.  I would watch it anytime.  Awesome.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought and read this series because I'd never seen a book with so many reviews.  I thought that whatever this series is about, it must be worth the read...and it was.<br /><br />It's a great read.  Fast paced and full of interesting detail. Very scary premise that reminds you how things can be when people want/have too much power and control.<br /><br />Thanks for adding that extra about Silo 17, Mr. Howey.  I was about to be disappointed.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is surprisingly great!<br />Can waste a lot of time playing this game...<br />And the grandma part is pretty cool. :)
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This was the best of the 3. There could have been more autobots though, it seems that the balance of good vs evil wasn't close enough for the autobots to be the victors in the battle.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|I enjoyed hangover and even liked hangover 2 but hangover 3 was a complete waste of time and money. The intro was offensive and depressing but I soldiered on and watched it for forty minutes. That's forty minutes I'll never get back, there wasn't one glimmer of comedy in that time. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
B000MCIBAW|1.0|Audio quality is not as good as the albums these were taken from. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Such a great charming and funny movie. Definitely a classic and a must watch for everyone. Enjoyed it all the way through.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I always knew the songs were good, but it was very difficult to get through the entire CD because I felt like I was being jackhammered.  I know there are naysayers here, but to my ears this sounds SO much better than the original release.  Some of the songs sound like completely new songs, you can actually hear the nuances now and there is spacing between the instruments.  Great lyrics here (especially in the context of Neil's life) and really good tunes.  I actually hear a little bit of U2 in a few of the songs (Alex's guitar harmonics) and just a bit of grunge influence (both in a good way).  &#34;One Little Victory&#34; with clean-sounding drums and guitars now just soars, and there are plenty of other examples on here.  Some people would view this as a money-grabbing move (making fans pay for an album they already own); I view it quite different, I think they did the fans a service in admitting that the original was poorly mixed and now fixing this.  This is easily in my top 10 Rush albums.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Got this as a freebie a few years ago and it's great. You'll be playing this for hours. I got it for me but my son also became addicted. It really forces you to think outside the box about patterns.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A very interesting story of two young men, and what it was like to fly planes during WWII, from both sides of the conflict.  The back story of their encounter in combat, and their eventual meeting and friendship makes the read that much more compelling.
B00F91H15W|2.0|Felt VERY b-rated. Not impressed.Acting was mediocre at best. Would have made a better lifetime movie than an actual film.
B005FISBTO|4.0|If you like Dexter, this sixth season is as good as any of them. The season finale did not disappoint.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|Good junk food for kids. They left a lot of room for more movies in the future. The overall Alien concept is pretty neat and the bad guys look very cool. I'm a 42 year old adult so I sat through and thought it was okay it but the 11 year old loved it.
B00003CXA6|3.0|In the sequel to &#34;God's and General's,&#34; &#34;Gettysburg&#34; lacked the dramatic firepower that the title would imply. This was a letdown after that first in the trilogy, and because of it, I won't be looking to purchase the third installment.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|great movie. classic heist/getaway type film. also features an awesome Audi s8 with some cool car chase scenes. it's a well made movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun game so play it more and don't stop playing till you have to Wright one of these and then play some more
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was gonna buy the book when I get paid next week. Might have to borrow money, I can't wait that long to read the 3rd book. I would recommend this book to any!! Definitely romantic thriller!
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|I loved this movie! Lots of OMG moments. Images you'd wish you didn't see cause you can't get then out of your head.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Not sure why some people are giving this movie such a low rating, it's not that bad.  Compared to most of Will Smith's roles, this one was definitely a supporting role with his son doing most of the acting.  I enjoyed the overall story, with the focus on the father/son relationship instead of the aliens.  I believe it is an entertaining movie and should be viewed as such.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I loved reading the Lincoln Lawyer and decided to read another of Michael Connelly's novel.  Both Lincoln Lawyer and The Reversal are very good.  I know I will buy at least one more of his novels in the future.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very good series.  Can't wait for Season 4.  I just didn't like the end of season 4.  I won't give it away tho.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I decided to read this series once I saw the show.  I finished the book today after ordering the kindle yesterday!!  The show has been cancelled and I am disappointed but I AM A KING AND MAXWELL FAN!!!
B005LAIH2C|3.0|Not what I expected, the plot could have been better but the action was good; all the actors were great and the special affects and make-up were good! interesting Friday night or Halloween movie!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Easy to play and will be great to play during a long airplane flight. Could<br />become addictive.  One of the better mahjong games.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This well thought out work made many connections for me that I am convinced of the real heaven and a  real God who loves us all.
0385536828|5.0|Another brilliant creation of that talented McEwan. I await his next as I have read all his work, as I suggest everybody do.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game is fun when you first download it. As a free product, it might entertain you for a few weeks. The problem is that once you get good at it, you end up repeating the same meaningless tasks forever after that. There is only one level to run on, and you have only three goals: run, collect gems and coins, and score points.<br /><br />The tasks are fun to accomplish, until you get stuck with only \\"lifetime achievement\\" tasks, such as collect 500,000 total coins. I spent a long time grinding to pass the \\"run 1,000,000 total miles\\" task, only to have it replaced with \\"run 10,000,000 total miles\\" and I immediately uninstalled the game.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|this was a very good movie it held my interest at times it had me on the edge of my seat i would highly suggest that if you like good action movies then i know you will enjoy this one i will be watching it again
B00ESY77LO|5.0|I love anything with Leonardo Dicaprio in it.  This wasn't exactly what I was expecting -- I thought it was more of a gangster type movie -- but I was very happy that I rented it.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|I would never say this movie is better than the Matrix, but I personally enjoyed it more than the Matrix. Perhaps I'm biased after ready Ray Bradbury's &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34;, which I believe this movie was heavily influenced by (a very good book by the way). As I'm sure other reviewers will do a more detailed synopsis of this movie than me, I'll briefly go over my impressions.<br /><br />Another great performance by Christian Bale. If this is a first time for any viewers watching movies he stars in, check this out! The martial arts choreography is stellar. The action sequences are perfectly balanced between the surreal and reality in terms of special effects. The movie's score does an excellent job at portraying the emotionless future that is centered on the movie's plot.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is definitely worth your time to checkout all the way through. It is an instant classic in its own right. Thanks for reading my review.<br />-Kojifresh
B000UZNSWM|4.0|This is a post World War ll story involving  Communist North Korea, Catholic South Korea, Communist  China, France and the U.S. Essentially it was a battle for domination of the former French Indo China and the defeat of France and America. The country and its very difficult terrain and weather was an important part of an ugly loss. The loss was imposed by multiple Infantry Divisions of China and a totally misjudged North Korean Army on hap-hazard, quickly assembled piecemeal units of U.S. Army and Marine Corps  personnel. General MacArthur, operating from a Command Post based in Tokyo Japan, insisted on replacing the totally outclassed French Army with U.S. military units against the highly trained Communist troops. This alone...was one of the major errors of the history of warfare on planet earth. MacArthur scored with the First Marine Division by invading Inchon by sea. Other than Inchon, sadly, it was one botched battle after another for the stubborn and arrogant behavior of our General. President Truman, with no other<br />choice fired MacArthur. The U.S. Marine Corps waged a stunning battle after being surrounded at the Chosin Reservoir by multiple<br />Chinese Divisions and lost hundreds of troops to the freezing weather. The Marines finally marched to Hungnam were evacuated byships. Depending on a few remnant WW ll troops the U.S. Army was repeatedly badly damaged before peace was achieved.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|It works well, I like size the also, its very light and easy to store, mostly used on small grills.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Probably I'll like it more once it is availabe in Brazil, if your planning a trip to US, buy this only if you don't mind waiting for this to became available. Otherwise try to install the software from Play Store and checkit if it is available in your country.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Okay, this is by far the best you can get from a free game. This has about ten or more stages with about 30 levels on each,so we are talking about 300 or 400 levels - no joke! This game also comes with like 20 mini episodes ( also totally free) that you can watch right on your game!!! 85% of the time I spend on my kindle is spent on angry birds. Now most people think that just because I am a girl, angry birds is not a thing for me. But they are totally wrong!!!! This is a game for EVERYONE of all ages, whether you are a boy or a girl. Even my dad has fun playing it!!!! So what are you waiting for? Totally get this game right now!!<br /><br />(Oh and also this has like no pop up ads, and if there are any, it just for like angry birds games or something.)
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I like golf, I like solitaire. this app is very good! I have it on my other computer and play it every day.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this  book because it's about American dictionary and win you read it you read view read good things.  By Octavia hilson.  This book name is.  The new Oxford Americaln dictionary
B000FCKGPC|5.0|We are given perspectives from different people than the ones we heard from in the first three books and yet the story is just as great. In fact, it was rather enlightening. I quite enjoyed it. I am about to start book five and can only hope that Mr.Martin has book six out soon as I'm not ready to leave Westeros just yet.
1594744475|2.0|This is a very cute Bento book very well organized.<br />It was printed in China however and the ink reaks with an odd odor.<br />As I've flipped though the book I started to get ill.  So I'm warning<br />everyone to be very careful.  The ink has something wrong with it.<br />I could taste it as I read just by opening the book.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoy reading all of Mary Higgins Clark's book so it goes without saying that I enjoyed this one as well.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Not really much to say, other than it is okay. Kinda interesting plot. Of course anything with Morgan Freeman in it is worth watching, but he has a rather small role.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|The ability to connect with varying persons, communicate with the stars of ur fave shows, that makes it so entertaining.
B0060CXSR4|5.0|Purely classic. One of Disney's best! You cannot go wrong with this one. Just the songs are worth it! My kids love it dearly.
B003B02O14|5.0|This book was very twisted.  I would recamend this to any mystery lover. I did not like the ending a all.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|The movie had a good moral to it and was very exciting to watch. I would very highly recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a little different story, but I really enjoyed the story.  Mr. Grisham made a very complex story understandable.
B00471JSR4|5.0|And still do. It could have been less camp (Wayans sucked in it) and more serious action without the accelerator suits. if you look past that, you will enjoy it. Sans the characters knowing each other from before.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|We read all the books in this series.  So this was the completion of the four book set.  We like the dimatic between the main three characters.  Ms Meyer writes in a very easy style.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Beautifully crafted songs.<br />Lovely to hear real North East accents.<br />Wonderful stories behind the songs written and performed by people who have a true understanding of the rich history of the area.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Season 8 is far better that 7. It takes half way through the season to pick up,<br />but the story line does get better. Enjoyed the golem episode and men of letters.
B002HEWNB6|5.0|I purchased these over a year ago and they are still going strong.  Very sturdy, comfortable and reliable.  Size fit me as expected, and provides the support needed for almost all activities.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is the first Stephen King book I've read in many years. I think I gave up on him after Tommyknockers. He seemed to have gotten beyond editing -- too successful for anyone to tell him to tighten things up and not always write a 20 pound book. But a friend recommended this one, giving me a hint of the premise, and I decided to go for it. I have to say, I enjoyed the book. It stayed true to the rules he established at the outset, and time travel is just irresistible. The end didn't pay off quite as well as I had hoped, but I was not too disappointed. I recommend the book. It will give you your time and money's worth.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Liked it would recommend it to introverts and extroverts alike just check it out and you'll probably enjoy it yeah
141659521X|4.0|I love these novels but I felt Vince rushed the ending.  Unlike other books the ending really left me hanging for a conclusion that matched the intensity of the writing.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Ryan Gosling is cool,that's all I have to say.It's a really good movie with beauty in the sadness.One of my favorites.
B00BCSBU4E|5.0|Masterworks recorded wonderfully. If your trying to start a collection of classical music, this set makes a fine cornerstone. Many of these are truly historical recordings.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|My grand son loves this movie. Even though it has been around a long time, ever day he watches it, it's as if he falls in love with it all over again.
B00FKQ38OE|5.0|I just downloaded the NEW Paul McCartney album and I must say I love it!  Sir Paul still has the magic touch!  At 71 years of age he still knows how to write a good song.  His voice may not be quite as strong as it was 50 years ago, but whose is?!  He still can sing and certainly make memorable songs.  Keep writing and performing for us Sir Paul and please come to MINNESOTA sometime for a concert...we LOVE and MISS YOU!!!<br /><br />Michael
B001EC0OMW|5.0|Great screen play. The characters are always right on que. the color is as good as it gets for this time frame.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Ease f use and quick cleaning rate all 5 stars. Very useful to speed up my Kindle FIRE HD tablet.
B002MG2RG0|5.0|One of the best vampire moves in 1930's. Cant get enought of this movie, its so life like and the characters are splendid.
B00ET2ODX0|4.0|Look at them both. You'll see scenes in the weinstein truncated version that were cut from the  Hong Kong version and having seen both have no idea why they were.  Someday I'm sure Wong Kar Wai will release a longer version that both of these with even more scenes. I hope so!!!!!!!!!!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Excellent app for getting to the root of your device and accessing file directories for finding files. Very easy to move files where they need to be or where you want them. Very impressed...thanks!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read. Brought back all of the great goose bump moments of The Shining. One more in the long line of well written scares that I have come to expect and enjoy from the Scare Master!!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|This is one if the best games I've played lately. Its's got hos, but you have the option of playing a mini game instead.
B004X4QVSO|5.0|I watched the first one and I'm happy I watched this one. It's a good movie with lots of intense scenes.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good book, not life changing, but good and interesting story line.<br /><br />More words more words more words more words more
0316074314|5.0|Twelve men meet at the Crown Hotel in Hokitika, New Zealand, in January, 1866. A thirteenth, Walter Moody, an educated man from Edinburgh who has come here to find his fortune in gold, walks in. As it unfolds, the interlocking stories and shifting narrative perspectives of the twelve--now thirteen--men bring forth a mystery that all are trying to solve, including Walter Moody, who has just gotten off the Godspeed ship with secrets of his own that intertwine with the other men's concerns.<br /><br />This is not an important book. There is no magnificent theme, no moral thicket, no people to emancipate, no countries to defend, no subtext to unravel, and no sizable payoff. Its weightiness is physical, coming in at 832 pages. And yet, it is one of the most marvelous and poised books that I have read. Although I didn't care for the meandering rambling books of Wilkie Collins, I am reminded here of his style, but Catton is so much more controlled, and possesses the modern day perspective in which to peer back.<br /><br />I felt a warmth and a shiver at each passing chapter, set during the last days of the New Zealand gold rush. Catton hooked me in in this Victorian tale of a piratical captain; a Maori gemstone hunter; Chinese diggers (or \\"hatters\\"); the search for \\"colour\\" (gold); a cache of hidden gold; s&eacute;ances; opium; fraud; ruthless betrayal; infidelity; a politician; a prostitute; a Jewish newspaperman; a gaoler; shipping news; shady finance; a ghostly presence; a missing man; a dead man; and a spirited romance. And there's more between Dunedin and Hokitika to titillate the adventurous reader.<br /><br />Primarily, THE LUMINARIES is an action-adventure, sprawling detective story, superbly plotted, where the Crown Hotel men try to solve it, while sharing secrets and shame of their own. There's even a keen courtroom segment later in the story. And, there are crucial characters that are not gathered in the Crown that night who link everyone together. The prostitute and opium addict, Anna Wetherell, is nigh the center of this story, as she is coveted or loved or desired by all the townspeople.<br /><br />The layout of the book is stellar: the spheres of the skies and its astrological charts. You don't need to understand the principles and mathematics of astrology (I don't), but it is evident that knowledge of this pseudoscience would add texture to the reading experience, as it provides the structure and frame of the book. The characters' traits can be found in their individual sun signs (such as the duality of a Germini). The drawings of charts add to the mood, and the chapters get successively shorter after the long Crown chapter.  The cover of the book illustrates the phases of the moon, from full moon to sliver, alluding to the waning narrative lengths as the story progresses.<br /><br />\\"But onward also rolls the outer sphere--the boundless present, which contains the bounded past.\\"<br /><br />Take note of the cast list at the beginning, which is quite helpful for the initial 200 or 300 pages. With so many vivid characters coming at you at once, it is difficult at first to absorb. However, as the pages sail (and they will, if this appeals to you), you won't even need the names and professions. The story and its striking, almost theatrical players become gradually and permanently installed, thoroughly and unforgettably. From the scar on Captain Francis Carver's cheek, to the widow's garment on Anna Wetherell's gaunt frame, the lively images and descriptions animate this boisterous, vibrant story.<br /><br />Catton is a master storyteller; she combines this exacting 19th century style and narrator--and the \\"we\\" that embraces the reader inside the tale--with the faintest sly wink of contemporary perspective. Instead of the authorial voice sounding campy, stilted, and antiquated, there is a fresh whiff of nuanced canniness, a knowing Catton who uncorks the delectable Victorian past by looking at it from the postmodern future.<br /><br />You will either be intoxicated by this big brawl of a book, or weighed down in its heft. If you are looking for something more than it is, then look no further than the art of reading. There's no mystery to the men; Catton lays out their morals, scruples, weaknesses, and strengths at the outset. The women had a little poetic mystery to them, but in all, these were familiar players--she drew up stock 19th century characters, but livened them up, so that they leaped madly from the pages. There isn't much to interrogate except your own anticipation. If you've read COLOUR, by Rose Tremain, don't expect any similarities except the time, place, setting, and the sweat and grime of the diggers. Otherwise, the two books are alike as fish and feathers.<br /><br />The stars shine bright as torches, or are veiled behind a mist, like the townspeople and story that behave under the various constellations. Catton's impeccably plotted yarn invites us to dwell in this time and place. At times, I felt I mined the grand nuggets of the story, and at other times, it blew away like dust.<br /><br />\\"But there is no truth except truth in relation, and heavenly relation is composed of wheels in motion, tilting axes, turning dials; it is a clockwork orchestration that alters every minute, never repeating never still...We now look outward...we see the world as we wish to perfect it, and we imagine dwelling there.\\"><br />You will either be intoxicated by this big brawl of a book, or weighed down in its heft.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|My adult son suggested that I buy this set of DVD's.  I could have gone to our local stores and purchased them, but knew I wouldn't take the time to do this.  It's easier for me  to sit at my computer and click a few buttons and then the product just arrives at my front door.  So convenient.  They arrived in perfect condition and we have enjoyed watching them.

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|For me it all started in February of 1964 and it has never stopped. For those of us who love The Beatles, we know what an extraordinary  pairing Paul McCartney and John Lennon were, and that could never be repeated. Paul has many episodes to his career since and, as we can hear in Early Days, he is still dealing with the devastating loss of John (as so many of us are).<br /><br />This album, appropriately entitled &#34;New,&#34; is full of the best of Paul's musical directions over the past 10+ years. He takes his basic self and transforms himself, brings in the cutting edge stylings of The Fireman, the sentimentality of &#34;Memory Almost Full,&#34; some Americana/Skiffle inspiration and has created a wonderful new work of art.<br /><br />For us aging Baby Boomers, Paul's vitality is a true inspiration.<br /><br />I dare any one who loves John, Paul, George and Ringo to not tear up on &#34;Early Days.&#34;<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I didn't watch this for a long time because of it's title.  WOW!  Was I wrong!  I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND IT'S CHARACTERS!  This is a sensitive, FUN, bittersweet, intriguing story about such an eclectic group of characters who, in such a strange way, all complement each other.  There is the lonely widow who is searching so hard for love.  There is the unhappy couple who have been pretending for so long that they are right for each other....and many others who play against a backdrop of Indian culture which is fascinating.  This is a rich, complex story that is too multi-layered to explain here.  I only hope you take the time to watch it because we want to encourage wonderfully written films like this from Hollywood!  This is the kind of movie I watch every time I see that it is on cable!  LOVE IT!
1400069807|4.0|This book is informative, and sadly horrifying - an overview of addicting Americans to processed food in the name of marketing. It's a little dry, though, but worth the mental wrestle.
B009MO5E10|3.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt has come a long, long way since Third Rock!  He is an incredibly talented actor who is fearless when it comes to taking risks.  How risky is a \\"thriller\\" about a bike courier?  Pretty risky!  It is difficult to make a movie about bike couriers \\"thrilling\\", but they do a fairly good job.  Gordon-Levitt as Wilee is given a chit (worth thousands of dollars) to be delivered, and he has a desperate dirty cop chasing him all over the city to get it in a life-or-death chase!  A very interesting concept and well-executed.  It is interesting but not \\"thrilling\\".  This is a good popcorn rental to watch once.
B000SEKNUK|4.0|Weaves lessons learned from authors' musical and counselling careers, and the workings of an orchestra, into the more general notion of possibility-thinking. Excellent lessons for life. Expect the best outcomes and they may just happen.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|The first volume was riveting and captivating. A great read that I read start to finish since I couldn't put it down.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|I was skeptical when Nick left the band, but wasn't all that impressed with Spocks Beard X. This new recording sounds fabulous and songs are well written. Love the new singer. His voice cuts thru nicely. The old/new drummer they have been using sounds great.<br />I almost feel like Nick is really playing again. I miss Nick, but this new line up rocks-- Go Beard!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We cancelled our cable and are just going with Netflix, Hulu plus, etc.  So far I think it only works with Netflix, but hoping it will work very soon with other apps.  So much better than having to hook up a HDMI cable to our laptop and connect it with our TV that way.  Very convenient.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|After The Crane Wife (2006) and The Hazards Of Love (2009), both records more experimental and at times operatic, Colin Meloy and his band of Decemberists decided to strip things down and make a more simple record. There have been hints of it in their work always but this is truly their folk/ country record and after previously exploring other cultures, this is them at their most American, both musically and lyrically. A running theme on the record is the changing of the seasons and it's beautifully captured with \\"January Hymn\\" and \\"June Hymn.\\" The dance along country of \\"All Arise!\\" is delightful and there are a couple of tracks that sound like tributes to R.E.M. with \\"Calamity Song\\", \\"Down By The Water\\" and the powerful \\"This Is Why We Fight.\\" \\"Dear Avery\\" appropriately closes the record and it brings it to an end where you feel like it was a 40 minutes well spent. I love the imagery and sounds on this record. A nice addition to anyone's alternative music collection.
1582701707|5.0|Everything went smooth.  I got it before the expecting time, and completely new! even with the plastic rap! Thank you
B00EUS9JF0|1.0|Wow! this WHOLE album is so slick  and poppy it is unbearable to listen to. compressed sound bleeding from your speakers, just like trapped inside a shopping mall. totally forgettable bubble gum music with mostly embarrassing lyrics and no risks taken anywhere. predictable beyond belief! john lennon would have the cute boy spanked hard!! his last \\"honest\\" album was \\"chaos and creation\\" which benefited enormously from nigel godrich's production and mccartney's love story break up... there was some emotion there.<br /><br />some impressions of the songs follow:<br /> \\"save us\\", a super slick riff that resembles \\"fine line\\" from chaos and creation. but fine line was nice and raw... this is shiny and flat!<br />\\"alligator\\" is at least bearable, echoing the sound from 1993's \\"off the ground\\";<br />\\"on my day to work\\" also seems stuck in off the ground's sound...(which by the way is a pretty weak album);<br />\\"queenie eye\\" is mixed so ridiculously loud, it sounds, citing george harrison, like \\"blood from a clone\\";<br />\\"early days\\" is so corny and his falsetto voice is so shot, even with auto-tune, it's depressing....<br /> \\"new\\" is catchy and bearable but is so over produced it kind of ruins it; again, SLICK is the word.<br />\\"appreciate\\" ...well there's nothing to appreciate on this song; a forgettable tune with a drum machine...in 80's fashion flash back...but mixed louder!<br />\\"everybody out there\\" sounds very very similar to \\"if you wanna\\" from the very good \\"flaming pie\\" album; the difference is the production; \\"flaming pie\\" was not over produced; instruments breathed and had space; no space here; the whole sound on New is \\"on your face\\"...<br />\\"hosanna\\" a decent tune which could have benefitted enormously with a less slick producer; a nice bass line which brings memories of the very good 2001 \\"driving rain\\" album.<br />\\"i can bet\\" poppy tune, simplistic, loud, annoying and unfortunately... non recyclable.<br />\\"looking at her\\" again so overproduced plus forgettable Plastic/machine driven drums<br />\\"road\\" oh well....is not the \\"long and winding road\\"...is not even the \\"lonely road\\" from driving rain; it's instead a contrived forgettable song with horrible backing vocals...and the machine driven drums...<br />\\"turned out\\"  another poppy very very happy paul song! with a slow intermediate part and a \\"bang-bang\\" quote from Maxwell's silver hammer...how clever! how boring!!<br />\\"get me out of here\\"...yes, please, get me out of here!!! but the truth of it is this is the best song in the whole album. a simple more acoustic tune with a bluesy feel. listenable, almost enjoyable...<br /><br />all and all a terrible disappointment!  ... this time around is just muzak. ...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A waste of time. It wasn't even good erotica.  I read the book just to see what people were talking about.

B000GCFY0I|5.0|On my blog:  [...]<br /><br />\\"We're not freaks, Tally. We're normal. We may not be gorgeous, but at least we're not hyped-up Barbie dolls.\\"<br /><br />Review<br /><br />Ok, I'll admit, this book was not on the top of my TBR (aka to-be-read) shelf. There are so many books that I want to read and this one wasn't really getting my attention, but I decided to buy it, after finding it at an amazing price. Turns out it was a really great decision!<br /><br />Set in the future after humans (aka we) have destroyed the world, \\"uglies\\" follows the story of a young girl who is about to go through the same operation everyone goes through in order to become pretty. So the first thing that captured me in this book, was how unbelievably crazy this world was, but at the same time not too hard to imagine. Actually, disturbingly easy to imagine! I can not find it unbelievable at all that maybe one day everyone will be going through an operation to turn themselves pretty. A lot of people seem to want to do that even now! This, though, as we very clearly see in the book, comes with a price. Being pretty means being the same as everyone else, which can be extended to not only looking the same, but so much more!<br /><br />The only thing Tally, the protagonist, wants is to finally be pretty. She can't stand to see herself in the mirror and feels like she is completely ugly and repulsive. Shay, her new friend, on the other hand, doesn't want to go through the operation. She has actually found a place where people who don't want to become pretty escape to and tries to convince Tally to go with her. I really liked Shey's character in the beginning of the book. She was a refreshing change to Tally, who at first wanted exactly the same as everyone else. Shay was the one questioning the whole system and convincing Tally to do more crazy and fun stuff than she had ever done before.<br /><br />So, as the story evolved, Tally's character really started to pick up and grow and she was becoming more and more interesting! I wasn't a huge fan of Tally in the beginning of the book, but I ended up loving her! I was admiring how brave and open-minded she was, considering of course, the world she grew up in. In the end she turned out to be a great, strong female protagonist.<br /><br />The whole book was written in such an extraordinary way, that I felt like I was watching a movie! I don't know exactly what it was (that's the whole magic of it) but I had a picture of everything in my head while reading it. I definitely think that the book could also be turned into a great movie!<br /><br />All in all, I am now a huge fan of the \\"Uglies\\" series (hence the \\"5 golden stars\\") and I can't wait to find out what will happen next!<br /><br />First Line<br /><br />\\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\"<br /><br />Recommend it for...<br /><br />Anyone who likes dystopia that is fun to read, but also has to do with important \\"philosophical\\" issues
B005UG542S|5.0|have collected all of the Cds in this series this this completed the collection. Excellent delivery exactly as promised great prtoducts

B008Y768XO|4.0|It was a good wholesome family movie. Not riveting and exciting, but worth watching with kids. I would recommend it.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I thought it was done in a very realistic format, It is a movie you want to watch at the least 2 times.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I am still not able to us it. It cannot access my wireless system for some stupid reason! I have given up trying for now.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I have no idea why so many people dislike this CD...it is their best most cohesive work since Vitalogy.  The lyrics are great and the musicianship is outstanding.  A few of the tracks are on the mellow side but for what these songs lack in power the melody makes up for it...I streamed the entire album last week and I can't wait to listen to it under headphones.

B000GWE44U|5.0|A classic that should be on every horror movie goer's shelf. And not such a bad buy at 8 bucks!
B007A4SDCG|1.0|I've never given a 1 star review before and something must really suck in order for me to do so; With that said I present to you &#34;The War Of Art&#34;. This book is absolutely terrible. No substance at all. All it says is to avoid resistance in life and actually do work. Gee how insightful. Skip this, don't even consider wasting your money on this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really have grown to love this book. It is definitely erotic but it is also a great love story. Love is about breaking down barriers and exploring the unknown with the person you love and that's exactly what this story is about. This story has helped me learn to express myself in my day to day life as well as in the bedroom and I've grown to care for Christian and Ana as characters! Happy reading!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|my son uses it most.<br />He says its good. He uses it for school work.<br /><br />He would recommend it to others.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Recommended!  Sucked in right from the start.  Looking forward to watching the rest of the season.  Kevin Spacey is awesome.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a great book to read. It keeps you interested at all times. It was very hard to put it down! I'd definately recommend it!

B001ANSS5K|5.0|John Green is so awesome.  Surprisingly his books are rated for Teens.  His writing is so intelligent and his characters as so real, human.  I have read everything he has written.  Don't be put off by the &#34;Teen&#34; label.  I hope he is still writing.
B00F0N7JUG|1.0|***Please note that this is a review of the Collectors Edition of Pacific Rim***<br /><br />Pacific Rim is a fantastic movie by Guillermo del Toro.  A fun ride from start to finish, it's a movie that will have you wondering why all summer blockbusters aren't half as engaging and well put together.<br /><br />This Collectors Edition, however, leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Shown in the official product images, you would believe you are getting a Jaeger statue along with your movie.  What you are actually getting is a Jaeger shaped movie case.  Here in lies the problems:<br /><br />1.  You get no actual movie case to place your movies in, just the \\"statue\\" shown in the images.<br />2.  #1 is a problem because the plastic Jaeger case has no back.  It is completely open.<br />3.  #2 is even more of a problem because the latch that holds the disc lid in place is half a millimeter high.  That is not a typo.  The slightest bump will swing the movies out.  In my case, this actually knocked the case off of my shelf hen I set it down the first time.<br />4.  The discs are all stacked on top of each other.<br /><br />Normally I would say \\"simply avoid this\\", but if you are a fan of the movie, this is the only way to get the \\"extra\\" special features disc, which contains about 30 minutes of features.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie in a terrible package.  If possible, buy it in any other packaging possible.  I hope this keeps someone from making the same mistake I did.<br /><br />Movie - 5 Stars<br />Case  - 0 Stars

B00FPH3YQA|3.0|I liked the first two movies but this movie wasn't up to par in my opinion. It was just ok.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Very good quality camera holster. However it is a little bit big for my DSLR but it's ok, I can bring other stuff in it now!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|While entertaining, I finished this book and definitely felt I'd seen this all quite a few times before.*  The writing is solid, although the chase scenes are rather drawn out.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW!<br /><br />*Take The Prisoner, add one teaspoon of your favorite zombie movie, a health slug of The Village, a pinch of The Lottery, and top it off with the first episode of the TV series Eureka, and voila!  You have Pines.

0440245206|1.0|This book is awful....I kept reading it as I was curious how anyone could publish such banal junk...I thought it would turn around...it didn't<br /><br />This book is repetitive, trite and irritating....if you start reading it, keep in mind that it doesn't get any better.  Mad at myself for wasting my time...
B0089LOG02|5.0|Marvelous storytelling, meticulously researched, and superbly written. I've ready many books about the Orphan Trains, but none have moved me as much as this book has. I only wish I could give it six stars. I can't praise the writing enough: it is beautifully woven together from past to present. Just buy the book: you won't regret it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it, love it! A great series with superb actors. You must see it. If you like period dramas you will enjoy it greatly.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|The acting is terrific as is the cast. Script and visuals are first rate.<br /><br />I rented this from my local video store and watched 3 episodes only, in consecutive nights. As excellent as is the quality, I had to stop watching, at least for now. With our current political situation, the program strikes too close to home. I am so fed up with politicians at this moment that I need a break before pursuing the series again.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|The tenth album of veteran rock band Pearl Jam is their best work since the majestic 2000 release Binaural.<br />It opens with the fantastic rocker Getaway and reaches places Pearl Jam haven't seen for a long time with the atmospheric Pendulum.<br />A great record with many highlights.
0452289963|5.0|I read the Power of Now and experienced an incredible breakthrough in my spirituality. Having just read A New Earth I can honestly say this takes you to an even higher level of understanding.  I consider Eckhart Tolle a spiritual genius. He has the ability to explain a very mysterious and complex subject in a simple, clear and concise manner to anyone desiring enlightenment.  I am recommending this to everyone I know who is seeking answers.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Could not put this book down!! Such a well written story for those who are different beyond their control and what challenges they face. Def recommend

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I originally felt Temple Run 2 was too hard and I'd never get the hang of it. Little did I know that not only would I get better, but I would have to beat my best score every time I played.<br />Graphics, gameplay are great. My issue is now that I only have one mission left (10 million lifetime meters) but I'm only at 3 million, can the game be updated for more accomplishable missions so that I can reach level 9? The 10 million meter challenge should come at level 10 so we can use gems more often.<br />Thanks

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Packs a punch and keeps you guessing!<br /><br />John Grisham books are my kryptonite. I admit it. When each one comes out, I jump to see what Grisham will spin out next. The Racketeer is a real ride. I enjoyed the book to an extent. There were a few issues, but I'm glad I read the book.<br /><br />The writing is one of my issues this time out. There were moments when I wasn't sure whose point of view I was in. Malcolm, the main character, tends to be the main point of view, but here and there I was treated to others. While this might not be bad for some readers, I had to go back and figure out who was talking. For me this was not good because Malcolm is one step ahead of everyone else. One detail out of place and I got lost.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was the treatment of one of the secondary characters. I really liked the character of Nathan. The way the plot twisted was interesting and had me needing to know what happened next, but it also left me irked about Nathan. Oh and his dog. I won't give any spoilers, but yeah, I wasn't happy. I got emotionally involved in the story, so kudos to Grisham for that, but this was an instance I wasn't pleased.<br /><br />Now it may seem I didn't like this book. Wrong. I enjoyed the book and thought about it long after the last page. I discussed it with friends and went back to read it again. Grisham spins a real whale of a tale in this book and while some of it isn't to be believed, it's worth the read.<br /><br />Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews
0792844890|5.0|I enjoyed his movies he made and this one is a great one to get if you are a fan.

B00B5AIB14|5.0|This one of my fathers and i favorite albums and this is for any fan of his music and albums.
B00138CSLM|5.0|This 1987 concert was the true springboard for Roy Orbison's monumental comeback a year later with the release of the \\"Mystery Girl\\" record and the hit single \\"You Got It,\\" among other accomplishments. Though he had been steadily reestablishing himself since the late 1970s', this concert was where audiences took notice and were suddenly reminded of Orbison's singularly powerful, operatic voice, and the great records it helped create.<br /><br />\\"A Black and White Night\\" is one of the most remarkable live recordings in existence, not least for the pedigree of the musicians involved; in addition to Orbison's own presence, he is backed by Elvis's legendary TCB band, as well as contemporary stars Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, Tom Waits, K.D. Lang, and several others.<br /><br />The 17 songs performed are all sung and played beautifully, with standout performances being \\"In Dreams,\\" \\"Crying,\\" \\"Running Scared,\\" \\"The Comedians,\\" \\"It's Over,\\" and the closing jam on his signature hit \\"Oh, Pretty Woman.\\" The sound is sharp and clear, and the energy of the performance really comes through.<br /><br />\\"A Black and White Night\\" is a must-have live album and an excellent testament to Orbison's legacy.
B00005Y23E|5.0|I enjoy his gold CD and this one is a great one to get if you like remixed and his hits.
B00AOOIIVA|3.0|It was ok, not anything to write home about.  The kids enjoyed it. And yes, it is in all black and white.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I always like his comedys and this one is a great one to get if you like his early work.

B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|This is one that I can easily see myself listening to over and over again, to really get familiar with all the songs. I'm enjoying them on the first few listen-throughs. I like her song style, her lyrics and her vocalizations. Distinctive and interesting and very pleasing (to me) sound to her songs. Some songs from the EP are on this disc, in case you're wondering.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|I enjoy his last concert on CD and this one is a great one to get if you are a fan of his.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I actually purchased this as a gift for my brother who lives abroad and hasn't seen it. But seeing as he's the brainy (nerdy) scientist type with an excellent sense of humor, I think he'll enjoy it, too.

B00CATSONE|2.0|Though this work contains very interesting facts of Tesla' s work and philosophies, the author muddied the waters with too much of his own rhetoric. Too much superfluous facts and make for somewhat \\"dull\\" reading to extract a few chapters describing Tesla the man and his work.

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|As usual, she delivers extraordinary writing, new characters we can care about, old ones we have missed.  My only complaint is that we have to wait for the next one!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read.  I recommend it for everyone.  A look into a world NOT many get to enter.  Support the family, buy the book.
B002IDH4PQ|1.0|I was very upset when I gave this as a gift and when my boyfriend opened it the second record was Sting and not Kid Cudi!!<br />I will not be ordering another vinyl from Amazon!!! This was terrible packaging to say the least!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book.  Kept my interest all the way through.  I never wanted to put it down! Everyone should read it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was my first time reading anything fromColleen Hoover. Within the first few pages, I knew this would be a book I would fall in love with. The characters were great. The storyline hit close to home for me. Everything about it was amazing.

B000096IBI|5.0|There’s something ironic about watching a film called “Modern Times” in 2013, when it was in fact filmed nearly 80 years ago (and for us it’s an odd choice for our first Chaplin film, come to think of it…). It’s also ironic that it was still a silent film, despite talking movies having already been around for 10 years. But the film is still an amazing piece of social commentary, combining strong social and political commentary around the central theme of humanity, and giving a last hurrah for Chaplin’s Little Tramp character, who is retired here (although the Jewish barber from Chaplin’s next film, The Great Dictator, is basically the same character), fading into the sunset, having for the first time been heard as well as seen (in the film’s famous nonsense song – L&eacute;o Daniderff’s comical song Je cherche apr&egrave;s Titine, which Chaplin sings in jibberish – we still don’t truly hear him talking). But with this film, Chaplin was indeed getting with the times, and it was his last true silent film – his next film, The Great Dictator, was a transition film in that it was a talkie, but it was also spoken largely in jibberish (he probably still wasn’t comfortable with the idea of being judged as a proper talking actor and competing with the likes of Orson Welles and Clark Gable). His final four films were all talkies.<br /><br />Chaplin made the film after taking an unprecedented five years off between his previous film (City Lights) and this one. During that time he travelled the world, meeting Mahatma Ghandi, Albert Einstein and HG Wells and putting together big ideas, which resulted in the development of economic theories that shared concepts with communism, all ideas that came from sympathies and associations with controversial thinkers and which would land him in hot water later in life (in 1957 he was barred from re-entry in the US, his new film Limelight was suppressed, and he lived the rest of his life outside of the US, rarely ever to return, despite having made his career and fortune there, setting up companies and employing thousands).<br /><br />The film starts off with an interesting scene of workers being hoarded into the factories, followed quickly of a scene of sheep being hoarded from one pen into another (and, if we look carefully, we see a black sheep among them, ha ha ha), before the entrance of the Little Tramp, on his way to work. The film has three distinct areas:<br />- working in the factory<br />- in and out of jail<br />- love<br /><br />The film takes on several themes, including drug use (cocaine), the inhumanity of the industrial age, police discrimination and other post-Depression era brutality, wage slavery and inhumanity, all of which can be overcome by indomitable free spiritedness. Yay! By the end of the movie, there is no more steam for social commentary, though, and the tale revolves around the Little Tramp and his new girlfriend, the “gamine” (which, by the way, means “a girl with mischievous or boyish charm” – not a commonly-used word any more, I had to look it up!). This is where we get the amazing blind roller skating scene, as well as the beautiful and hilarious nonsense song. The gamine, of course, is played by Paulette Goddard, Chaplin’s off-screen lover at the time as well, and they go off into the sunset together to live happily ever after, apparently forgetting the Gamine’s two younger sisters, whom she had been supporting early in the film before the death of their father.<br /><br />The scenes and stunts are hilarious beginning to end, and we could hardly stop laughing scene after scene. Chaplin was a real genius of physical comedy. I can hardly describe the hilarity any more than I already have, it just needs to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />The bonus features are great, and there’s probably as much bonus material as there is original film!<br /><br />A 30-minute documentary explains how Chaplin was living in an era of mass unemployment and the rise of industrialization. He did an 18-month tour of the world, where he was horrified by the rise of nationalism in Europe, while at the same time developing economic theories of redistributing both wealth and work. It mentions, and shows stills from, the original ending, which showed the Little Tramp going off into the sunset alone after the gamine enters a convent to become a nun (?!?!). We learn that talking films had been around for a decade, but Chaplin still wasn’t ready to do one, although he had developed a talking script that was later abandoned. This film marks the only time that the Little Tramp’s voice is heard, although Chaplin’s voice had been heard by the public speaking in German in Vienna into a short recording device. Modern Times was the last great silent film to come out of Hollywood. As bonus materials we also look over the shoulder of Philippe Truffault and Jean-Pierre Dardenne as they discuss the film. They note that there’s always food in Chaplin’s films, and how the film is a documentary of the times, going all the way to the shack and shanty-town. Industrialisation had brought the cost of a Model T Ford down to $300 from $850, but there were social growing pains. And while voices can be heard speaking in the film in parts, they are always through a machine of sorts – a recording device, in the case of the hilarious feeding machine demonstration (there’s that sheep-herding thing again), a security screen, an intercom. We see a great outtake of Chaplin interacting with a stern traffic cop at one road crossing. We see the cool opening animation of TOBIS studio, with the rooster crapping out the “I” into “TOB S” (who came up with this stuff?? The sample here shows a later version of the same thing, with the rooster’s egg forming the “I” – since when do roosters lay eggs?). Great photo collections show the factory, from jail to paradise, factories re-open, back again, outtakes from the department store silverware robbery scene, soldiers, the gamine’s nun scene), set and production sketches and photos, search for locations, and Paulette Goddard’s publicity shots. There are also several documentaries: Behind The Scenes In The Machine Age (1931), Symphony In F (1940), Liberace’s “Smile” (1956) which was based on Chaplin’s score for the film, and For The First Time (1967).<br /><br />Behind The Scenes In The Machine Age is a film created by the Department of Labor of the US government showing how industrialisation has robbed men and women of jobs, how it has created labour efficiencies, and how job efficiencies still need to be created, even as the enforcement of good conditions for workers is being promoted. Women, Waste, Bureau, Jobs, Rhymes, Silk Hose, Lollipops, Crackers, Cereals, Bandages, Sheets, Book, Typewriters, Cigars, Cushions, Telephones, Track. It goes on in silence for over 42 minutes. Printing – the hand press versus the mechanical press. Scenes of women working silk hose machines from roller machines, loading 1931 boxes of Mars bars, wrapping lollipops, packing 1931 boxes of Corn Flakes!! Shows entire production process!! Shows girls “building” books, folio by folio. Automatic typewriters. Symphony In F shows the production of a car, from the arrival of crude rubber to the creation of tires to the production of a car, with a special event showing the creation of the 28 millionth Ford. The V8 mark turns into a weird little animated V8 boy. For The First Time, in 1967, is a Cuban documentary that shows a mobile film crew taking their mobile movie experience into the mountains to show some people their first film – which is Modern Times. Wow!! There’s a cool surf guitar intro, we meet the passionate projectionists, and then we meet the villagers. “I have no hobbies, I never go out. There’s no place to go, nothing to do.” “I have 12 children, and who knows how many grandchildren. Only God knows.” The previous government didn’t allow movies.verware robbery scene, soldiers, the gamine’s nun scene), set and production sketches and photos, search for locations, and Paulette Goddard’s publicity shots.

1476727651|3.0|The quest for steam, or one's human essence, by a marauding band of zombie-like creatures (the True Knot), underlies this good versus evil sequel to Stephen King's The Shining. The book follows the life of Dan Torrence, one of three survivors of the Overlook hotel fire featured in the earlier book, as he descends into a squalid life of despair, anger, and alcoholism as a way of dealing with the burden of his paranormal powers, or \\"shining.\\" He is then transformed by fortuitously landing in a small town in New Hampshire, where he works at a local hospice and successfully participates in the local AA program. His ability to usher dying patients into a peaceful death through his powers earns him the nickname the sleep doctor. In that small town he encounters a young girl with even more extraordinary powers, and together they embark on a suspense-filled battle with the evil True Knot in typical Stephen King style. The steam harvesters must be stopped!<br /><br /> As someone who is not an avid Stephen King reader and who does not ordinarily seek out this genre, I nevertheless found myself pulled into this improbable tale populated with bizarre and freakish characters. The reason, at least in part, must be his highly readable, easy going narrative story-telling style that builds with a slow burn and then lulls you into an eventual suspension of your disbelief.<br /><br />Finally, this book was not horror inducing in the sense of the Pet Sematary.  Suspenseful, yes, and you pursue it nonstop to the end. Perhaps I should have read it in the middle of the night!

B008Y212PI|3.0|The puzzles are fun and you can try them at a harder difficulty once you get the hang of it. I don't like that I was forced to post a review to unlock the bonus level.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever made so far it couldn't get any better than this .It make me get more skills every time I play it !!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B005LFQRTC|4.0|very good DVD for the price. we all enjoyed it alot. surprisingly forgot a lot of details  about the show
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Beat game ever now you can play with other people awesome and you can get the best towers and upgrades. I Love it.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I love where this author takes us - geographically and emotionally with his characters! Can recommend this book to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is a roller coaster that had sexual emotional factors. I enjoyed reading and am ready for the next one Fifty Shades Darker
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Why does Kevin do what he does? Was it the mother's parenting? The father's parenting? Or was it just a quirk of genes?
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Does not work with my Samsung phone and HP printer.  Removed it from my phone after much agitation and trouble.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Sustained use of narrator with an interesting condition, but not entirely credible as a treatment of someone with Asberger's. Entertaining as a picaresque novel.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Riveting, a must see. Excellent writing and acting.  I found myself watching multiple episodes.  Very realistic in light of the days we live in.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's easy to use,  and has a reasonable number of built in tones.  I was looking for a quick, easy-to-use alarm clock. I'm happy with this one.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|This is quite entertaining. BUT when you finish all the levels, It just stops...no continuing games no more levels. At that point You just remove the App.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Super funny! My daughters and I love the music! A little raunchy at times. For the most part a very entertaining movie.
0671578278|5.0|Miles' campaign to woo Ekaterin Vorsoisson is a wonderful read!  The road to love really ISN'T smooth, at least concerning Miles.  Buy this book. Read this book.  You won't be sorry.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I love this show!! Totally addicted to it.  Always look forward to seeing the next episode. Just can't get enough.
1451638450|5.0|I, along with many others I am sure, always wondered where Ivan would end up.  Lois's latest book in the Vorkosigan saga leads us on a merry chase with Ivan's adventures.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really liked playing this game, it was fun yet challenging to play. For free I would recommend this for any mystery gamer. I find the content interesting to keep me going.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I navigate to where I need, says it needs internet connection, which it has and is using.  I need to then re-navigate to where I was.  Unacceptable.  Oh, and it's playing right now too.  WTF!
B00340ESIS|2.0|But for a 'must read' book it wasn't as convincing in its argument for adherence to its structure for me as it seems to be for those who recommended it to me.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Loved it. Laugh out loud funny. One of the most entertaining, lightly written & endearing books I've read in a while.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The Secret Garden is a very light, easy to read book, great for readers, age 8-11. Although it is definitely not an “action-packed” book, it succeeds where many books fail – its incredibly deep, realistic characters. Mary, Dickon, Colin, and their animal friends nearly jump off the page.
1476733953|3.0|I picked up Wool because I wanted to know more about the eerie paragraph on the back. I was oleasantly enthralled in the story. The story was gripping, thought-provoking and gritty.<br /><br />I honestly felt no emotional pull to the characters. They were flat to me, sort of generic with no interesting qualities, quirks or mannerisms. Their thoughts were simple and straightforward and the limited complexity definitly disapointed me. But I figured it was written this way to let anyon relate to them, because of the nature of the story, where we should feel as if it could happen to US. I could also be making that up.<br /><br />I also found myself skipping paragraphs and skimming frequently because, as another reviewer brought up, the descriptions semed to drag on and didn't hold my attention. They came off as pointless and slowed down the book greatly, making it less gritty and edge-of-your-seat and more gloomy and slow.<br /><br />I hope someone else has said this, but...<br /><br />I AM PRETTY SURE HUGH HAS PLAYED A TON OF FALLOUT!! This book, written years after Fallout was released, is the EXACT same plot. I know things are recycled and nothing is new these days blah blah blah but it is the SAME thing! The silos, or vaults, built before an impending doomsday to store humans in a safe place, a toxic world, curiosity of the outside world, not knowing of other vaults but the leaders do, a revolt against the leaders etc. It's strikingly similar to me. I thought of Fallout the whole time and it definitely took away from the excitement of the story and definitely overshadowed my focus on the plot.<br /><br />Other reviews have compared it to other books, movies etc. so it must just be an overly recycled plot. Still, it took away from the reading at hand, knowing he was getting praised for such unoriginal ideas that have been done over and over again. Plus, this version of the plot wasn't really that great. The characters were dry, the writing was slow and heavy and ruined the pace of the story, and the plot lacked the intensity I had hoped for. The first chapter with the first main character was the only chapter I liked a lot. I wish they had followed his story instead of Jule's and the other dull characters they chose to focus on.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Its more accurate than the weather channel app and uses half the amount of battery and same kid of features. Love it!
B004LRZ2YC|4.0|Gone are the dark, deep and depressing back-story of your typical blood-sucking maniac. No, no, no - this introduces a compassionate protagonist and an antagonist that you can (almost) pity. Without giving away the plot behind Amazon's basic description, let me just say that there are tender, non-vampiric moments scattered in this moderately paced tale of pre-teen angst. Even though the two main characters are 12 (one, for a very long time), this is NOT a movie for anyone under the age of 14 - so be advised.
B008JD7VZM|2.0|This set is nice, but not at that price tag. I was disappointed in how small the size of this lego kit is compared to its price. The pieces themselves are put together nice, but definitely too costly for what you get.
0316066524|5.0|I am a big David Foster Wallace fan so even though I rarely by books off of Amazon I decided to get this one and don't regret it one bit.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|This movie would not play all the way through on at least three occasions that I tried to view it. What I saw was great, but it never finished.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This book came from one of the better schools. When I first read it, it was in article format. The information became part of my curiosity to increase capital wealth and the jobs that go with it. The more I looked, the more sure I became that the world's job creation engines had been slowed, but could be increased to induce the jobs and wealth which America, as well as Europe need to be prosperous, secure economically, and reignite the job creation engines of capitalist dynamics. Therefore, the questions asked in this book became the basis for my explorations, research and intellectual revelations. Thus, when I became satisfied that I had found the answers to why companies failed, I knew I had found the answers to change this situation. What I did not know was that I would run across a new science, which would show the empirical mechanics for achieving these growth ends and expediting job creation and wealth.<br />  If every European and American, reads no other book beyond their religion, they must read &#34;Race Against The Machine,&#34; by Brynjolfsson and McAfee. Make no mistake about this; if you are going to live in our world, you had better understand this book. If you are going to prosper on Terra-firma, memorize it!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This product has a lot of potential if properly supported. Hopefully it doesn't end up like google tv. It has a great price point.
B00BE909NO|5.0|Having recently travelled to Solomons this story had a great impact. It is remarkably well written is full of humour, interest and tragedy. I immediately downloaded Great Expectations which was a joy to revisit.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|It was sweet and hilarious.  The kids were laughing.  My 2 year old stayed still long enough to watch the majority of it.
B00114RKT8|5.0|We need men like William Wilberforce to fight for what is right. This movie is beautifully done. I watched it with my family. There are some sensitive parts for children showing the brutality of slavery but it was tastefully done. We had a good discussion as a family about equality and treating others with kindness. William was a man who did not give up on the cause for justice. He is the kind of man we will study as a family and try to emulate.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|As always, Brandon Sanderson's books never dissapoint. I took me a while to start reading this book because of its lenth, but once I started reading it, I had to finish it it in a few days. Wonderful.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I'll admit I have been around long enough to see the old Marvel cartoons and read the comic books so I am hard to please. I liked the whole &#34;good guy&#34; side of the story and all of Starks new suits and gizmos. What I did not like is how they presented the MAndrin versus what he was in the comics. I thought that was lame. It was still good enough to give it 4 stars but I can't go with 5!
B00164GDE6|5.0|Great I lov the movie one of my favorite and bad boys 2 and can't wait for bad boys 3 come out if it come out
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My granddaughter downloaded this program and loves to play it every time she comes over. Looks like a good one for the kids. Thanks Paw Paw
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Great movie.Star Trek, with a twist.I would recommend this movie, great special effects. Kirk's future altered by the Romulans, intense!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of the cutest, funniest, sweetest movies ever. The ONLY kids' movie I can stand being played over and over in the car on long trips.
0691142165|5.0|This time is not different guys, this time is not different.  We could be in for some real trouble ahead
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A wonderful read. King scores yet again in this fantastic return to a much beloved character. Apart from the continuing story of Daniel Torrence, King also creates a horrifying new monster. Rose the Hat is one of the best villains of all time, and most definitely the best I have encountered this century. A great reminder as to why I fell in love with King all those many years ago. Thanks for taking me away yet again and keeping me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book in the series seemed to struggle at times. It started<br />Out well enough but couldn't find its focus in the middle.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I wasn't expecting a great movie, but I thought this could have done a little bit better.  It was a little too slapstick, but I still enjoyed it.
6305128952|5.0|Saw this movie years ago on TV and loved it....Robert Redford was so right for the movie.  I had not seen it for a while and why<br />they don't show it more on TV, I don't know.  I recently was at a discount book store and saw the book so got it and when reading<br />didn't recall some of it in the movie, so decided to buy the CD.  I love horses and felt I should have gotten it years ago.
1416596585|5.0|I liked the fact of describing the ways to do things and the vision of the chiefs. I entirely recommend it.
B000XUUQQK|4.0|I actually liked this one way better than the original. The original just was not scary enough for me at all. This sequel has everything you want and more. If you liked the original version of this film, then you will like this one too. Good cast, good acting, good storyline, and way scarier & gorier than the original. Lots of thrills and scares in this one. Boogeyman 3 was also just as good. I recommend this film to own or complete your collection. The DVD looks pretty good too, although this would be better on Blu-ray. 3.9 out of 5
B00DQR26EC|5.0|its a fun game. good leveling system. alright humor. its worth 3 bucks. good time waster. one of the better rpgs out there
B0026ICAOS|5.0|This is the Blu-ray release that you want to get for this film. Has lots of nice extras too for the 25th anniversary edition. The translation to Blu-ray was very well done, and a vast improvement over the original DVD version. Do not be fooled by the cheaper Midnight Madness series edition version. Skip that one all together. This one is far more superior. I highly recommend getting this film for your collection, if you can find this version at an affordable price. I got mine for less than 10 dollars new, but that was awhile back. great film. great cast, good acting, good story, and great low price. 4.8 out of 5
B00CEF014E|2.0|Another boring book with the usual stupid women, stumbling around in the dark. I wish so there were more mystery book that are really a mystery.
B001FFBI82|4.0|This movie I really did enjoy a lot. Very good story, acting, cast, and an awesome translation to Blu-ray disc. Was very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend this film. You can get this movie very cheap on Blu-ray now too. Pick it up. it's a must have for any movie collection 4.3 out of 5
B000HZHBIM|5.0|While it moves a bit slowly, this movie reintroduced the crew of the Enterprise as well as the ship itself! It also posed some very interesting questions about the stuff we send &#34;out there&#34;.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|What can I say. This movie just speaks for itself. It is really nice to be able to have and view this movie on Blu-ray disc. I thought the translation to Blu-ray was very well done. I am very pleased with my purchase, and highly recommend getting this film on Blu-ray disc. 5 out of 5
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I kept wanting to look ahead. Reading what the characters were thinking really made the story come alive. Couldn't put it down.
B000GCFO08|3.0|I watched this when it first came out. I thought it was an ok film. it kept my attention the whole time at least. Just picked it up on Blu-ray new for $4 (I couldn't resist that price) and about to watch it again. I had purchased this back in 2008 and bought the Full Screen version because I didn't get my new Sony HDTV till a few months later. I will try it again on Blu-ray and adjust my rating if I like it better. Maybe with a better widescreen version and viewing experience I will like it better this go round. rating 3.2 out of 5
B0040I09RM|5.0|the drama structure is set up differently but it feelsl like the Sopranos and The Wire on Motorcycles and it works!
B003IY48PS|5.0|This is one of my favorite horror movies from the early 80's time era. For a low budget film, I really liked this one a lot, and far much better than the new re-make version of the film. I like this one the best out of part 2 and Army Of Darkness too. Those seemed to be getting a little too much comical more than anything, where I found this one to be way more seriously taken. Bruce Campbell does a great job in this film, along with the rest. Great film, good acting, nice translation to Blu-ray disc, and at an affordable price. I recommend getting this film for your horror collection. 4.7 out of 5
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started off a little slow but towards the middle it became quick paced and fantastic. Gillian Flynn is without a doubt a very ingenious and talented writer. I'm giving this book a four out of five because I wasn't crazy about how things ended for the protagonist. I would have liked to have seen how things would have unravelled if the public found out the absolute truth. Maybe there could be a sequel to make up for that though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game is so fun to play the game subway suffers it's the best game in the whole world but I guess it's not the best game in the whole world.
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|Clearly, Microsoft Office is at a juncture and this book provides a concise and readable explanation of the future of Excel.<br /><br />This book addresses problems of managing extremely large datasets without the necessity of using SQL Server/SQL Server Analysis Services. Through thorough explanation and demonstration by examples, Rob Collie provides a structured decision-matrix for enterprise developers considering how to achieve performance improvements, deployment efficiency, and &#34;non-coded&#34;  Excel (without VBA) solutions without the intervention of professional database programmers. I recommend this book for persons with limited VBA and SQL programming experience, as the PowerPivot engine exposes similar functionality achieved by programming through the use of DAX formulas - more easily comprehended by traditional users of Excel.<br /><br />On its own merits, this book is so readable that I recommend it  to anyone interested in Microsoft's vision of its future Office product. For example, the capability exposed through PowerPivot requires hefty system requirements, necessary to know prior to purchasing new workstations, or on the contrary, making a decision to use Office in the cloud or on a SharePoint Server.  This subject and many others are covered by straight-talk explanation.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book series. Loved the detail in everything. Definitely a five star read. Not for younger children, though. Great books in all.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The Wall Street thieves, speculators, gamblers and swindlers are still in charge of regulating banking and the stock market, in the Obama administration.  Even the thirteen billion dollar fine, which the US Justice Department is assessing against J P Morgan Chase is only a fraction of the fraud which J P Morgan perpetrated.<br /><br />It is exciting to see Hollywood addressing one of the most serious problems facing the nation.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is an amazing, smart, funny drama with compelling plot lines and character growth. we love it and watch every night!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Reading this book made me think about how we never know what another person is thinking and how they perceive our words or actions.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|I love short stories. In fact, if I had to choose my favorite genre, I would say it is short stories. They should be amusing and surprising. My favorites are Kurt Vonnegut, O'Henry, Melville, and the Jewish Mendele Mocher Sforim.<br />Unfortunately until recently, I couldn't find contemporary short stories I truly liked--until I first laid my hands on this Oleg Medvedkov's books. The stories are surprising, entertaining, fresh, and generally improve my mood every time. They present a humorous point of view and contain unconventional storylines and characters, not tiring the reader with long  descriptions. Just short and sweet. Love it!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|People should try this at this very very good people should try this app very good I'm very happy is verygood
B005PK56TA|5.0|I started watching to show with my son, it was not anything like I thought it would.  I was expecting just blood and gore, which is not my style.  It had a great story line to it.  Had to then watch the season 2, which I didn't realize would be totally different.  Loved it too.  Excited for the third season.

B009UZLRJE|5.0|Typically you only hear about something if it's bad - so to get a good review must mean something - it is a pain to write and they require so many words, yet I will say that I have had no problem with amazon and am happy with my purchase.
0307743659|5.0|I just read this book again, after reading it last many years ago, and it was still every bit the powerful and thrilling novel that I remembered it to be. King’s writing style puts you in the head of the characters in such a way that you can actually FEEL the changes in their thoughts and personalities over the course of the story. For example, as each chapter goes by, Jack Torrance's mental deterioration is lucidly and frighteningly FELT, as though seeing straight into a window of his mind. The progression of the contextual maturity of his son, Danny, can similarly be vividly witnessed as the book races to its end.<br /><br />And, “races” is a most appropriate word; this book is one that is almost impossible to put down from start to finish, with each chapter steamrolling into the next, taking the reader along for what is an incredibly wild ride (and, again, this is not even my first time reading it)!<br /><br />I re-read this in “preparation” for reading his new novel, Doctor Sleep, which returns to Danny, now middle-aged and with another monumental challenge to overcome.  Re-reading this reminded me of just how incredible many of King’s early novels were, and actually makes me want to start re-reading more of them in the near future. But, first, Doctor Sleep…!

B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|I can't rate the second season, but I did enjoy the first season.<br />The story, although a bit far fetched, is still credible,<br />The characters, are three dimensional, and well acted. You won't go wrong by watching this series.

B005544TRQ|5.0|I was a huge fan of Boston Legal, and seriously haven't found a legal series that could get me interested. I got Amazon Prime membership and thought I might as well use the benefits that came with it - instant video streaming. I decided to give this show a try since I've heard good things about it, but I really wasn't expecting much. And OMG, this show is amazingly brilliant. It's funny and provocative, it's what I loved and missed about Boston Legal. I finished all 3 seasons within 2 weeks, and have completely fallen in love with this show and almost all the characters. If you like legal drama/comedy, you NEED to watch it. PS. The 2 main guys on the show are so cute, which never hurts.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|The silly-but-fun plot, satire regarding military, eccentric young woman, robot becoming sentient .... with the nicely-chosen cast, is fun to view again. Johnny Five lives!
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Well the idea of getting s drug that can open up your head like that, imagine what we could accomplish...maybe we can give this to some members of the Tea Party, they certainly could use a boost in intellect. :)
0920668372|5.0|This has turned into one of my and my 5-year old son's favorite books. He always asks me to read it to him before bed. It's very sentimental to us and I hope one day he can pass this down to his own children. Also gave this as a present and they enjoyed it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very good book. It is even better than the movie. can't wait to read the next one.
B00364K6YW|4.0|There are several P & P movies available and this is very good! (Another I like is with Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen by Focus Features) If you like &#34;going back in time&#34; movies I suggest &#34;Lost In Austen&#34; with Jemima Rooper (2008). Do not forget to read the P & P story in book format as well as watching the movies. This movie makes an excellent Hostess gift with that bottle of wine! Have a dinner party and have everyone come as a different character!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|First listen impressions:<br /><br />Save Us - Sounds like late era Wings/early solo (1980s) Macca. The harmonies sound like Wings and the song structure is solid.<br /><br />Alligator - Starts off with a hint of Lonely Road without the darkness, and If You Wanna, from Flaming Pie. I like this one.<br /><br />On My Way To Work - A simple track where Paul paints a picture of a day in the life (so to speak). My favorite line, \\"How can I have so many dreams and one of them not come true?\\"<br /><br />Queenie Eye - The piano has a Hello Goodbye vibe to it. I like that he varies his arrangement and it's not a one-level drone pounding away for 3 minutes.<br /><br />Early Days - His voice is a bit weaker or vulnerable on this one which is very personal it seems talking about starting out a busker looking for gigs. I like how it starts as a narrative story then turns to a reflection of his experience since that time and where he is now with his legacy of The Beatles. pretty cool track! This song is going to leave a mark. His answer to biographers and opinion writers who think John was the band or Paul was just the fluff. Hell, he wrote more hits than ANY Beatle, as part of the band OR as a solo artist.<br /><br />New - Great track! Bouncy Beatles tunes never tire me out. I love that the title track and first single hits smack in the middle giving you something familiar already to listen to. The harmonies are terrific and tight. Hand claps have returned to pop music! Yes! Another Ringo style drum roll at the end of the track before the harmonies come back is brilliant.<br /><br />Appreciate - I'll lump this in with Memory Almost Full's \\"Gratitude\\" as part of an opus of attitude songs. Next album we will get to hear Thankfulness. lol Seriously though, this song has another great drum track behind it and a simple message delivered perfectly without preaching. Paul has always been the more upbeat and positive of the Beatles songwriters and this song is all about staying positive.<br /><br />Everybody Out There - Sounds like something off London Town (Backwards Traveller) or Tug Of War with a touch of Back to the Egg. An easy acoustic driven track.<br /><br />Hosanna - This may be the first track (one minute in) that's less than very good. It doesn't really go anywhere.<br /><br />I Can Bet - Back on track, this song comes out of the box with a good beat and a purpose. Great sound to this one.<br /><br />Looking At Her - Very nice! A bit different for Paul but in an understated way. Nice to hear something subtle yet interesting.<br /><br />Road - He must have been listening to RAM recently. This subject matter recalls Back Seat of My Car yet in no way sounds like it, with the possible exception of the piano driving the track. More hand claps! YES! You just don't hear hand claps on songs anymore. The Beatles did it a lot in the early days. More than likely it's inspired by all the touring he has done in recent years. A nice finish to the album.<br /><br />(BONUS TRACK SECTION)<br />Turned Out - This song could have fit into a Traveling Wilbury's album. I love the way he changes up his tempos all across this album. No song seems to go in one direction without altering somewhere in the middle. The best song of the Beatles had some of the biggest tempo changes mid-song.<br /><br />Get Me Out Of Here - Sounds like a demo to start which is a nice choice for texture. Apparently he is stuck in a box - hence, Get Me Out Of Here! lol The bass drum used as the pounding fist on the box trying to escape. A fun song! I guess it's him being trapped in certain situations he doesn't always enjoy. Pretty funny.<br /><br />Scared - Beautiful song. Although it seems it's a bonus track it's also on the regular version to my understanding as a hidden track. It has a bit of Driving Rain sadness to it but in this case what was \\"sadness\\" in Driving Rain is being used as trepidation and angst as he is unsure of her feelings for him. Not a great melody or anything special that way but it is a glimpse into Paul's heart for Nancy and that is refreshing to hear as he usually hides his feelings from everyone. This song talks specifically about that topic of hiding his feelings from the one he loves.<br /><br />Overall impression - Paul's voice hasn't sounded this strong in ages. His songs are both interesting and fun. The instrumentation is complex and yet familiar for Paul's songs. There are layers of textures to this album which plays so easily you get lost in the moments. The songs seem to fly by without wanting to press the advance button - something I had to do with Driving Rain & Chaos & Creation too much. He probably wasn't in a good place at those times, so I'll forgive him, but he apparently has found love again and inspiration with Nancy. Back to the album.<br /><br />This lyrics are easy to follow and make sense from the start. He's not writing secret messages these days which is refreshing. I love the little things like the Ringo-esque drum fills on Queenie Eye along with O-U-T Spells OUT! from the Xmas messages, which were probably inspired by the childhood game he is referencing here. It's come full circle.<br /><br />Listening just once to each song (except the single which has been out a couple weeks) I enjoyed every track with the exception of Hosanna which just doesn't go anywhere. But I'll have to listen a few more times to know for sure. Sometimes the best songs grow on you. The album has already grown on me. It's in instant rotation for me.
B00C9SRN5Q|5.0|A must read .<br />I can see why it's Bill Clinton's favorite book.<br />Note that Marcus wrote this book for himself. He was the intended audience.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I liked too much. I liked the very intelligent way to accost simple topics and to convert in wonderful stories. I 100% recommend this book.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|Definitely gave some excellent tools. Some of the tools, like card tricks, were not very valuable to me, so I skipped them. But overall, this was a great system that I am already using on a daily basis to remember various things.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I turned this off after the first ten minutes.  Over camped, tarted up hacking of a classic.  Rent the Robert Redford version instead.
B000002I25|4.0|Good nostalgic music. Takes me back to a better time. Jim had a way that comes through with this CD.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game ever. really fun. non stop. but yet at the same gose fast. so many cars and so many maps. graffics sucked but oh well
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you like Mad Men and Law and Order you'll enjoy this show.  Very good story telling combined with interesting characters.
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|The characters are cute but were a disappointment as they do not all speak when attached to the magical talking castle.
B000002JNJ|4.0|The CD quality and vendor service was fine. I like other Pantera albums better but this one is not bad at all.
0316010669|2.0|Gladwell seems to propose that the power of our intuition is better than the power of thoughtful process, but then give examples that both maintain and contradict his theory.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />In the beginning he explains how a carefully studied piece of art turns out to be a forgery, but in the middle explains how a carefully crafted process beats out doctors' instinct at a busy hospital.<br /><br />Enjoyable and entertaining but not convincing by a long shot.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for something to keep me entertained during my daily 2 hour commute to NYC and back to Pa.  And i saw this book rated on Kendal top 25 list. I wish I could give it 10 stars. The book turned this non reading person into a book worm.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Great game.  Great graphics.  Great music.  Great hints.  Great map.  Great price for the length.<br />TONS of mini-games.  No hidden-object scenes.  Just pure point-and-click at it's best.  A little easier than some.  You won't need on-line help.<br />No problems installing or playing on Kindle Fire 2nd gen.<br />Thanks, Fire Maple!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|So glad I started playing this game it is very entertaining.  I love seeing all of the new dinosaurs that you can hatch.
B009GIPDQS|1.0|After a compelling start this degenerated into far fetched rubbish. This is the only Grisham book i have not finished.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Having read only three Jack Reacher stories, I already have a feel for his themes.  It was really fun and interesting to read about Lee Child's path to writing murder mysteries as a career.  You have to love anyone who is an avid fan of Travis McGee.  Child's plots are way, way over the top, which makes them fun escapism if you don't mind ghastly sadism.  There's never any question whether our hero will prevail.  Reacher is like the force of gravity. He will never let up. I get so embroiled in these stories I read all night, ignoring my responsibilities until the final resolution.  Alas, Reacher will never get the girl, I'm afraid.  Or rather, he always gets the girl, but not for long.  Great stuff; dependably thrilling.  If I read a Reacher story where he gets the girl and stays put, I'll let you know.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think this game is addictive i start playing and next thing you know its five hours later .very fast no lag but wish there was a way to get diamond's easier. But then it wouldn't be as good and extinsive think game is great.
B00498YZFK|3.0|It was interesting to see the sadness addiction brings on a family.  This is why people should not judge but love the oppressed.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Flynn must have killed the verbal SAT, her knowledge of correct grammar is impressive. Not sure that is important to a good book, though. The book starts off as if it has something important to say about marital relationships, but turns into a horror story with one of those impossible to thwart, impossibly inescapable villains blessed with perfect foresight. In other words, it turns to schlock. Of course, Flynn is going to be crying all the way to the bank if people criticize her book, since it is being made into what will no doubt be a blockbuster movie.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|Provides full and readable coverage of what the world can be like for introverts and others who prefer a quiet world. Does become somewhat over-wordy in places, however
B004WR125O|4.0|Works fine . The only problem I had was how to retrieve MAC address . I had to hook it up to my PC first .<br />Manual is not so clear assuming just one option of set up<br />Other than this hassle it works perfectly - no slower speed comparing to wire connection of my Onkyo
B005D9MUWY|2.0|If you update, you will lose your saved predictions and have to synchronize with &quot;the cloud&quot; and sign in with Google+. Because, what makes more sense than having your own predictions tied to a dead social media account and where it can be analyzed and sold to the highest bidder? No more scanning your device locally for your own typing habits either.<br /><br />Still better than default keyboard, I guess. Glad I didn't pay for this when it was a daily free app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I gave in, I loved it! I am a sucker for anything related to psychologically and this did it for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Each book gets better and better.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one. I hope she writes more stories like this one.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|The books came in perfect condition and they look beautiful on my book shelf.  They are also a great read for a great value.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a fun easy game to place. nice stress releiver. but the acorns can get expensive so be careful. have fun enjoy.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books if you like science fiction then I recommend this book to everyone it's so fantastic
B009IF82SK|5.0|Love this show, clean and funny for the whole family. I recommend it to all my friends , I have all six seasons
B001OQCV6A|5.0|must admit that I had my doubts regarding Robert Downey Jr portraying Sherlock Holmes.  My doubts were swept aside as I watched the film.  The essence of Sherlock was there with a dash of Downey.  Jude Law is the perfect Dr. Watson.  It was very enjoyable film.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Not your everyday take over the world plot, and great effects. Not really that scary thou. We would watch again.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Another excellent season of NCIS. I hope they never stop making the show. It's always exciting to watch as you always notice something different
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Surprisingly funny and good for a number 3 lol. Usually by 3 things tend to be pretty bad but this was actually funny as hell :)
B00CIH371W|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book by Inge-Lise Goss! I don't give away spoilers, so I'm going to keep this short and to the point: Read this book. Don't let anything stop you from reading this incredible story. Very amazing imagination, so many surprises that keeps you turning the pages, and expect to stay up all night reading. I can't wait for a sequel! Oh, and I still hate spiders :-)
B00A285OOW|5.0|Another great historical story by Gregory.  I enjoyed on finally understanding the past of the Tudor kings.  You don't hear much about King Henry VIII's mother or his father when you read the histories written.  I recommend this whole series .
B00C2IJJE6|4.0|The story is so moving and I don't mind watching this over and over again. Better in steelbook package too.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|It is one of the best series on tv at the moment, and season 4 is one of the best in this series.<br />In my opinion... ;)
B00C2IN76C|4.0|I just love superhero movies. Although this is different from Marvel or DC heroes we're all familiar with, this one has its unique and tantalizing story to tell.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|It camppier than the original but I grew up with the first Star Trek and it's hard not to compare the two.
B00D6QUJ6U|1.0|The entire concert is superb but the quality of this bluray is below my standards. This release is ok but it could have been better if it was true HD. To me bluray releases should be true to their intended video quality in high definition.  Anything else is just a quick money grab. For this release, video is upscale which is a shame but audio is lossless(good). I'm fully aware that is a standard definition release which is good that the label indicates but again bluray releases in my opinion should never be this way. As an audio/videophile, you can understand why I berate this item.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I have removed almost everything and am constantly told it not enough memory or something like that. Glad it was a free game.
B00FK04RCW|5.0|If you happened to have just completely loved Diane's first album and were expecting more of the same, then you might be somewhat put off by this followup. The first album drew quick comparisons to Carole King and Norah Jones, but this one is much more in the same lines as artists like Florence Welch or Adele. There's an increased emphasis on larger orchestral pieces punctuated with a strong bass line. It's darker yet more pop friendly and seems to be closer to the type of artist that Diane sees herself as.<br /><br />\\"Lighthouse\\" is the first song standout (I personally would have started the album with it instead of the rather mundane \\"Speak a Little Louder.\\" It combines synths, strong backing vocals, handclaps, hints of piano and a throbbing beat that veers between 70s pop and modern indie pop and really sets the tone for the album.  It's both darker as well as more interesting than almost all of her previous work combined.  \\"Tell Me Tomorrow\\"  has a strong piano line but pairs it with a restrained vocal and lightly upbeat music. If you switched out the piano for a guitar, it wouldn't be out of place on a Faith Hill album.<br /><br />\\"It Plays On\\" is a softer ballad that is borderline magic. Hypnotic and ragged with raw emotion--it's worth the price of the entire album. Also, I cannot stress enough that the normal cd is not what you want-get the deluxe. \\"Adelaide\\", \\"Staring At You\\", and \\"Hold On A Little Longer\\" are massive tracks.<br /><br />Some people may  be surprised to see the appearance of the \\"[Explicit]\\" tag after the album title, and it's due to inclusion of \\"Unf*d\\" which probably isn't quite what you're imagining. It's one of the few pure piano ballads on the album and is actually one of Diane's most vulnerable and likeable moments. It's honest and so very human. That said---if language isn't your thing--no need to avoid the album for literally just one track.<br /><br />I really could go into detail about almost all of the rest of the songs on the album. It's all just that universally consistent and interesting. Diane's lyrics continue to be a bit of a problem area though. They're not awful, just sort of generic. She's capable of more. Her father recently passed, and while you can hear the darker tone and mood to the album--I think she could have reflected this darkness a bit more in the actual lyrics as well.<br /><br />I thought Diane's first album was pleasant--but this one is memorable. And that's honestly one of the highest praises I can give an album. I've been blessed to have been exposed to a tremendous range as well as volume of music, and while I enjoy lots of artists--not many stay on my mind. With \\"Speak A Little Louder\\" though, Diane has made an indelible impression. Highly recommend.um. It's all just that universally consistent and interesting.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I grab this app when I want to balance my check book.  simple to use.  thanks for making my life easy.
B00FPH5F1C|5.0|It may be the final season, but I wouldn't be surprised if they started a spin-off called \\"How I Met Your Father'.
B00000E2VC|5.0|I'm not Chopin's # 1 fan, but this recording is one of the very few recordings that makes Chopin appealing for me.<br />Chopin played with class and elegance, not just regard for the technical.<br />I would recommend this to either the Chopin or ABM connoisseur.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The makers of this file explorer program really made some great improvements in this version, it really has a lot of options that give you the tools to use it for more than just viewing files.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game is fun.  Begging for a review loses you stars. Maybe let people enjoy your game and give a review if they feel like doing.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Brandon Stanton is an inspiration, and an artistic mastermind. I'm so proud of all he has accomplished in such a short amount of time. Much love, maybe one day I'll be in your next book.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I have my second HP Photosmart 7520 in two months - the first one didn't work properly and was replaced by the one I have now.  I have had 9 support people try to help me make the printers work (and they haven't always agreed regarding what the issue is), but even the new one connects with Web Services only some of the time then drifts off. I have to shut the printer off and turn it back on every time this happens in order to get the equipment to connect to Web Services. Functionality is poor in this regard. The printer prints beautifully when it works, but is frustrating when it doesn't. Everything has been checked including the router, the printer, the computer, the IP, etc., etc. The printer is just okay and that's about it. Sadly, I bought the printer because I have had an HP Photosmart wireless printer for 5 years and it was time to upgrade to a printer that has e-print - unfortunately, the replacement is a huge disappointment.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I got more addicted as I continued to play.  I just wish it didn't have the time limit on lives though.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I really like mincraft because ive had it before but then I hot a new kindle and everything transford over but mincraft I have problems playing because evrtime I pay for it and play it once it just dissapears and I have to buy it again over and over
1451695195|5.0|I am a spiritual person but not really religious. My beliefs are evolving as I get older and I thought  this book was fascinating! It is very well written and the fact that it was written by a Neurosurgeon added an extra level of interest to the whole story.
B0037VNX44|4.0|It was fantastic! Wonderful in its execution. Delightfully surreal. Though its surreality made it a touch confusing. I especially liked the cinematography.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I received a product with defect, When I plug in it on my TV, only appears a black screen with colors dots, and a light on Chromecast is red. I send a email for Google Support and they say that my Chromecast needs to be change because the reset button is stuck.<br />I'm very sad with this product. with Google and with Amazon for send a defective produto. And now I'll need send to back this product from Brazil to USA. And this will be many expensive. Don´t buy this product online, because you need view if the reset buttons is stuck, or you may have the same problem the me.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I was a bit cautious with this movie, not sure that it would be as funny as it actually was!  I watched it over and over again. and wish that since I only rented it and paid $4 to do so, that I could pay $8 to buy it instead of the $12.99.
B000JFDBXO|3.0|For the casual X-Men moviegoer fan this movie might satisfy: it has a lot of action, some fun special effects, and a tantalizing plot about being able to stop being someone you don't want to be in a moment through use of a miracle drug.  This probably resonates with a lot of people both because we are constantly told to be better than we are and that we can be all that we can be through some formula (drugs; diets; drinking the right beer...).  So this film, to be fair, has a good angle for a comic book action movie.  Oh, and they did a crackshot whizzbang job with the Beast (Kelsey Grammar, who'da thunk it! tremendous job!).  And there are a couple of shock-value moments (deaths of main characters, callous dismissals of others) that are sure to make the cinephiles following all of this to maybe perk up and go \\"no way they just did that.\\"<br /><br />So I'll admit to there being some entertainment value here.  But for the diehard fanatic, for the follower of the classic X-Men X-ploits the film deals beloved characters short-shrift (Cyclops) and major emotional main storylines as punchlines (I'm looking at you, Phoenix).  It's enough to make a raging Canuck like Wolvie cry.<br /><br />But it's certainly not as horrible as a lot of diehard fans make it out.  It's also not nearly so great as some of the tailgaters claim.  For me it stepped in it at a couple of points.  X2 has been the best of the bunch and X1 was solid.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I bought this just before a trip to India.  I wanted it exclusively to keep my Samsung G3 phone alive during my travels.  Somewhere I had read that the battery pack itself would stay charged for about a week.  It did not.  The only device I charged was my phone which wasn't being used except for a few Wi-Fi connections during the day and no other network connections of any kind.  No phone calls or texts.  Just a few email checks.  Still, I had to charge the phone every 18 hours or so.  And, the battery pack only lasted three days before it fell to 1 light.  Maybe I didn't get a powerful enough unit?<br /><br />The style is great - it's light and compact and about the size of my phone.  I have no complaints except that it didn't hold a charge long enough.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Oct. 29, 2013<br />Let me first say that customer service for AnkerDirect is exceptional!  As soon as my 3-star review posted, they called me to suggest that I had a defective device and offered to replace it immediately.  They sent the new one even before the first one was returned to them and paid postage for the return.  They are VERY serious about customer satisfaction and go above and beyond anything I've ever experienced with an online purchase.  I would have just stuck with the original product but always been a little disappointed. They have totally won me over.<br /><br />So, I have used the replacement unit for an entire week to charge my smartphone daily and it HAS held the charge the entire time.  I still have one light left.  So, I highly recommend this product and the vendor.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The game is good with a good concept, but the game itself isn't as good as I had hoped. In the beginning it was excellent, and I had some really good games going. Then, after about two months, it started getting really glitchy and randomly exited out to my home page. Now, I have to delete it and download it again if I want to play ONE round, and sometimes that doesn't even work.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I like this show and the characters but I especially love the sets and costumes.  I think if you like fictional stories such as this, then you will love Game of Thrones.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great collection, one classic old the time, is perfect have stay in your home.<br /><br />This ítem arrived at the indicated time
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Greatest series ever! I love Walter Whites and all of the cast of characters. This is a must watch show.
B000068NOV|5.0|Nice and sturdy item that I expect will last a long time! All my buddies ask me where I got it...
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Greatest series ever! I recommend this show to adults and to any one that wants to watch the best acting ever!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Just as good as the other iron man movies. I like them all. I would definitely buy this movie. :)
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Greatest series ever! I love Walter Whites and all of the cast of characters. This is a must watch show.
B005BZQTGS|4.0|It's funny how it's played during old times, but they talk like they're in modern times. I thought that was hilarious.
B00F6JMG0M|4.0|Love the direction they're heading, and I've been listening to Satyricon since its beginnings... This one tops Age of Nero by far.
B00112GVFO|3.0|Kind of ridiculous, so exaggerated, but fun... Sometimes<br />Off course cute actors help me put some stars but I d like to see less stupidity
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz and Samuel L Jackson where all great, but Leonardo DiCaprio took the cake on this one. Definitely a movie to see.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this has worked on my tablet,  my phone,  and my computer too. I love this app. I use it constantly to make sure that my devices work well. and greatefully I have not had trouble with the cleaner master either.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Excellent movie, definitely worth taking the time to watch. Loved it!! Mel Gibson is awesome, it's  filled with great actors
076780421X|5.0|This is a lovely comedy, love story. It also sends a good message, as far as culture differences and the misunderstandings that can come from different cultures. Love the movie.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Always complex subplots and good story writing in this series. I think you will like the characters too - sophisticated stuff.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great movie, not only have I watched it several times, but my grandchildren never grow tired of this delightful movie. With as many times as they have seen it, I should have just bought it. I encourage you to buy rather than rent it.
B009P3N1GI|4.0|I think this is one of the better novels by Sanderson. Focusing on the characters and their relations, it's not the traditional fast-paced epic fantasy that most expect. Still, it manages to be an awesome story about the challanges we all have to overtake and of accepting a different view point.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Love the movie, funny exciting. Never grow tired of it. It keeps your attention. It is a must see for all those who have not seen this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game ever. I just want to play to over and over and over..I'm very competitive so this is a great game for me to try and beat my friends !
6305428042|5.0|Great movie, especially around Halloween. Scary, but not over the top scary. Kids love it as well as adults. Funny, scary, exciting, nice family treat.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Brilliant story from beginning to end...never been so invested in a group of characters in any other book I've ever read.
B005SAP45I|5.0|Awesomness movie. Its an awesome mega spy movie. I'd recommend it for all ages...young and old. Prepare yourself for an awesome movie.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|The end of this book is classic Hitchens. Always leaving us wanting more. You will be missed sir. And this IS a MUST READ.
B005XUC398|4.0|Worth watching. Keeps your attention. I may watch it again to get a better understanding since there was aiy going on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing at how it makes you want to read on and on and on i never wanted to stop reading it. I recommend this book to whoever like drama, suspense, and of course action. This book is great Im 12 and its perfect for my age group and a few years older or younger. I really wish this wasnt the last book:(
1449433251|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes is a great book series.Calvin is a six year old kid who has a big imagination. He has a as stuffed tiger which he thinks is real and can talk. The books are full of his adventures; from time travelling to pegging Susie with a snowball. The story is from both a normal person's perspective and his, so you can see the story in two ways. My favorite part of the book is when he creates a giant 2d version of as dinosaur out of snow eating his house. Since it is so big, his parents can't tell what it is! All in all, I think this is a great comic series.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I enjoy playing this game I just need some friend to share my score with and wish my own Facebook account.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|The pack was quite useful for my camera<br />And lenses, however, on a recent trip the top<br />looped handle tore from the pack. This was only
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I hated the Shining I hate most of Kings work. It was silly beyond silly..really a giant spider???  He had a few greats Rita Hayward and the Shawshank Redemption, The Langoliers, The Long Walk were a few but not many. Kings books start with promise but stagnate and end so badly I often wonder why I bother, Under The Dome is a perfect example. Admittedly most of the time I read them its because I have nothing better to do. This one however is awesome, well thought out and very well paced. Its like King suddenly got a little of what Shawshank showed and recalled how to write. I have only rated 1 book with 5 stars and that was I, Zombie so for me to recommend a book takes a lot and being a professed King hater says something. If you get this and read it you wont be disappointed.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|This movie was scary do not watch it alone. It is not over the tip and it is not too long.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Who says that the end of the world is all doom and gloom.<br /><br />Well, for the most part, according to this movie, it is.<br /><br />But, mankind, reducing life on Earth to a living hell, hasn't precluded the possibility of the occasional love triangle - or two.<br /><br />There is high tech.<br />There is low tech.<br />There is no tech.<br /><br />There is opulance.<br />There is abject poverty.<br /><br />There is a revamp of gladiatorial combat.<br />Bread and circus's entertaining those un-washed masses, preventing them from addressing the disparity of the remaining civilization.<br /><br />Possibly the world's first disaster/action-thriller/gratutously-violent date flix.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. It is very entertaining and great for everyone. I'm waiting for the sequel.
B008GJV2OA|4.0|If you are a Peter Sellers fan - this is a must see.<br />Sellers does 3 characters - all reasonably well.<br /><br />The plot is based on the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine.<br />So, if you were raised on MAD, it is a blast from the past.<br /><br />It was written as a comedy.<br />The script is sarcastically pro-war, with a presumed anti-war object lesson.<br /><br />In truth, we've come closer to it than most will ever know.<br />For the most part, MAD is still go'n strong.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love it that replacement parts are available for my KINDLE.  Fast too !<br />It probably means my KINDLE will last a bit longer...  good!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Movie was well done. Some scenes leave you in awe.  There are a couple of spots you wonder why they bothered to put them in the movie, but they are minimal and the movie is worth watching.  There  was only one actor I recognized that was Brad Pitt, sure there were  other well known  actors, but I don't read credits.  I would watch the movie again
B007SVPZMW|3.0|The thing about tic tac toe is that anyone whose age has hit double digits knows it'll end in a draw and therefore won't play for very long. So an app version of tic tac toe will primarily be played by, and should be judged on its appeal to, small children who haven't figured out the secret of the game. On those terms, Terrific Tic Tac Toe HD is OK. I don't know about the claim of three difficulty levels. The only difference I could see was that \\"hard\\" won't let you win by missing an obvious block, but \\"easy\\" and \\"medium\\" will. I might find more differences if I spent a lot of time playing and purposely varied my own skill level, but I can't see the point: little kids don't need adjustable difficulty anyway.<br /><br />The three themes are all decent, though none have especially nice art or designs. \\"Sidewalk Chalk\\" is best if your child just wants to get on with the game, while \\"Christmas Crosses\\" and \\"Doodle Cartoon\\" have a variety of lengthy animations for each move that will delight some children but are torture for adults who just want this round over with, thanks. Familiar (public domain) music, including Christmas songs in that theme, plays in the background. Options are basic: turn music and sound effects on and off, switch which player moves first, and toggle between 1-player and 2-player modes. No ads, dubious permissions, or in-app purchases. Even for 99 cents, this is kind of thin in terms of value for money. With so many free versions of tic tac toe out there, the developers could have done more to make their paid version stand out: adding a variation with more strategic gameplay, or upping the number of themes. As it is, this is a worthy pick for tic tac toe fans or those with small children while it's free, but unless you or your child really wants one of the three themes, there's no reason to spend money on it.
B00DZAWPNM|3.0|I kind of liked the first album, loved the second, and tolerate the third disc. This disc is between a fever you can't sweat out and vices. It's more like Fever than vices, but nothing like Pretty Odd.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Saul the deceiver. How one man took a great philosophy, and turned it into a train wreck, that humanity is still struggling to overcome. A must read by all who have been deceived.
B003U4UNPK|4.0|Good suspense and story flow. Excellent character development. I found this a series a bit late but it is entertaining.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Something different for once. Great cast, great story. Very fun movie. My sevan year old loved it and mom did I to.

030746363X|5.0|Good Reference book.  I also have the audio and summary versions. Tim inspires me to focus my daily routine. Thanks!
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|I want to believe the DVDs and Blu-rays are mixed better than the movie-theater one.  John Myung was barely audible or visible in it. They really made him \\"the silent bass player.\\"  I was really surprised he or the other band members did not speak up on it at mixing?  To me, the Dream Theater sound has always been about the four instrumentalists and not just the guitarist and vocalist. Man, I hope the DVDs or Blu-Rays are mixed better. This is Dream Theater...not Bon Jovi!<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am thankful they continue to create this amazing music.  And props to James LaBrie for maintaining his vocals after all these years...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was late to the Downtown Abbey phenomenon.  Everyone raved about it so much that I couldn't believe it would live up to the hype.  It did.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I enjoyed reading about Tesla's fortitude and how he handled adversity in his life. This book would be a good read for teenagers.
B0091REZMW|3.0|So if this depends on using social media, I do not seem to be getting very far very fast!  Cannot seem to get enough energy to keep going very long or diamonds to get more energy.  Seem to be chasing my tail.  Has been OK, what I have been able to do.
0345528581|5.0|Purchased this book for son my because he has a passion for Health and WellBeing. He has read this book and has recommended it to many of his friends with the same passion and dedication

1476734941|5.0|I am so excited to discover this book.  It promotes a new method to lose weight based on new medical trials and shows how 12 hour fasts make revolutionary changes to the body. Great easy to read information. I have only tried this program for one week and I lost 1 1/2 lbs.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Easy to play without spending any money. Just have to be a little patient. Overall a good game for free.
B0081336FO|5.0|I watched both season one and two and I really enjoyed it. Thought it was a clever modern-day adaptation of the great detective. Really like the entire cast, especially Benedict Cumberbatch.
B00007KWHG|5.0|The perfection and magic of the vocals of Frankie  Valli  and the 4 Seasons are timeless and wonderful in their passion as musical performers.
B005YG1GZS|5.0|I bought this book years before I read it. So I managed to pick it up and began to read it. The first few chapters are very hard to follow, so I skipped around in the book... like a book preview. And I read some spoilers and I knew I had to start at the beginning. It was worth it, I love this book so much, I have to read it again. I love how the author brought out the notion that people are who they are for a reason and the effects of divisions in a society. Granted this is not the easiest read on Amazon, however this is one of my Top Ten.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I use kik all the time for chatting and gossiping with my friends since i dont have a phone, but now (after perfect function for about a year), kik just stopped letting me logg in.

B00136Q1I0|2.0|The greatest hits includes songs I certainly never considered greatest hits. So this collection is a bit of a mix. Nevertheless, I still love the Boss.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is fun to play. Not only do you shoot bubbles you catch falling gems in different pots for points. I would recommend this game.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love it but they need more vehicles and more levels for the game but other than that it's great game.  p.s I don't know how to spell has ha
B008RA3X5E|5.0|have to delete free version because this doesn't override it but otherwise works great. nice to use music for alarm &amp; sleep timer
B0063GORYU|5.0|At first it seemed too easy but the more I played, I found it more challenging.  Spider is great to play when you're  sleepy but not quite sleepy enough to fall asleep and still have a bit of brain action to do something lite.
B0014NDXGA|2.0|I've had this bushnell Tour v2 for 1 1/2 years.  Requires CR2 battery which has never had a very good battery life.  I had to change about every 6 weeks and now I have to change ever 7 days - play 3 times a week.  My last bushnell had a 9 volt which lasted a very, very long time.  Plus the older model would give a &#34;heads up&#34; re: low battery warning LOB - this model does not.  I hate it.<br /><br />I called bushnell and I will send back to them since it has a 2 year warranty.  However, I have to pay the shipping and was told it will take 3 to 4 weeks.  Just Great!!!!!<br /><br />Anyone know a better range finder to buy,
B00742H26M|4.0|Very  enlightening about the period, and not the comedy i am use to but it did have it's funny moments. Many twists and turns with a different ending than i would have expected. I like to be surprised by an ending.
B00943SQCI|2.0|A big disappointment. A few humorous moments, but not enough to save the film from being a huge bore. It seems so many of Depp's movies are dull and plodding unless he's wearing a pirate's hat.
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|57 year-old Dave Wyndorf has released his masterpiece with Monster Magnet.  New Jersey's Monster Magnet in their 24th year just keeps rolling along.  On their 10th studio album \\"Last Patrol\\", the band gives us some strong hard rock with acoustic flourishes with some psychedelic backdrops.  Great tunes in,  \\"I Live Behind The Clouds\\", the Donovan cover \\"Three Kingfishers\\", should be a stone cold classic on radio (I laugh at this, because you know they won't give it a chance), \\"Mindless Ones\\", \\"End Of Time\\" and \\"The Duke (of Supernature)\\".  Every song is kick ass, not a weak spot on this album.  Top 3 rock albums of 2013.  1. Deep Purple  2. Monster Magnet  3. Black Sabbath.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie,loved the addition of the little boy,and Piper's newfound fighting skills! Great family night movie if you like action movies!
B002DR3WG2|5.0|5.5 stars<br /><br />Did I enjoy this book: Do I really need to answer that?  It's classic.  It's epic.  It's ELIZABETH BENNET for goodness' sake! Of course I enjoyed it - as I do every time I read it.  I love everything about this book: the language, the ribbons, the serious drama that reads as just a little bit silly today... I love all of it.  Most especially, though, I love Mr. Bennet.<br /><br />--You thought I was going to say Mr. Darcy just then, didn't you? --<br /><br />Yeah, he's a dreamboat (a snarky, sarcastic, grumpy old dreamboat) but I'm absolutely smitten with Mr. Bennet.  I love him.  I lurv him.  I like him more than is appropriate for book reviewers to like literary characters.  When I think about Mr. Bennet, I want to hug him, offer him a drink, or maybe just buy him a book. I hear he likes books.  He's, well... he's awesome, and my mind's eye sees the happy ending not when Lizzie and Darcy end up together, but when a tearful Mr. Bennet tells me he is \\"quite at [his] leisure.\\"  Yeah, he might not be the most fiscally responsible guy in the universe, but he raised five daughters and put up with a less than intellectual wife without killing anyone. HE'S the hero.  HE'S the one who deserves the happy ending.  &lt;Ahem>  :::steps off soapbox:::<br /><br />Um.  Mr. Darcy is nice, too.<br /><br />Would I recommend it: Yes.  I especially recommend it to my husband, who has no idea who Elizabeth Bennet is (luckily he's seriously addicted to the Thomas Covenant series and Dune, or I'd worry about his literary literacy) (Yes, I just said literary literacy.  Twice).<br /><br />Will I read it again: You betcha.<br /><br />As reviewed by Melissa at Every Free Chance Book Reviews.
B00AUN2HO4|5.0|Love this movie! The kids hadn't seen it in years! Even though they have seen all the HP movies and read the books, the magic was still there!
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|This case fits very well around the phone and has all the perfect cutouts for mic's, speakers and functional inputs.  it does a great job of protecting the entire phone while also working perfectly as a stand so you can watch video without having to hold it.  I'm very happy with the cover so far and it has worked flawlessly for over two months now.  Looks like it'll hold up long term, but will have to wait longer to know that.  So far, it's great.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I was liked a kicked puppy on this - stephen king has disappointed me the last few years. I LOATHED and Despised the ending to the gunslinger series. I'm also QUITE upset over sk's slur on poodles in Doctor Sleep - this is personal issue as my white poodle died last year.<br /><br />All that I tried to put aside as I read Doctor Sleep - which continues with Dan Torrance from The Shining. I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed this book. I'm still leery - kicked puppy syndrome - but the tale has some inspired twists - kind of like the old days.
B00FPGV3RS|1.0|Wasn't expecting any kind of deep thought provoking movie but this movie wasn't even entertaining.  Jeff Bridges' western character got old really fast.  I couldn't even watch the last 20 minutes.  My 14 year old son will also say save your money!
0765348780|5.0|Of all the fantasy authors out there none have imagined a world as big, a story as complex, with characters as intriguing as Steven Erikson.  I've finished the Malazan series and was (and still am) blown away. This isn't a must read for fantasy fans, it is 'THE' must read =)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is fast paced and very addictive. Once you begin, it is very difficult to put down. It just continues the storyline of The Hunger Games, and is just as good. I can't wait to see what they do with a movie sequel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series.  Only wish it didn't take so long to get to the next season :)  But, with it being available here, I can watch the previous seasons whenever I like!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It's good a good movie, normal Tom Cruise action with good looking leading ladies. Can't go wrong with that combination.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Before i bought this set i have only seen the series 4 episodes on tv - and i must say that i was happy to see that the dvd-quality is much better - i like the series and i think that people that likes the sci-fi-art should buy it too<br />erik
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|If you are a fan or addicted to the show, or just one of those that wait a year afterwards so you don't have to pay for premium channels, I would recommend this.  Some people may not have liked this season as much as the original, but for me, it really picked up and held my interest more.  The Finale was just WOW, so if you are on the fence, get it.
1449437524|5.0|Purchased as a gift, my friend was in tears whilst reading this ( from laughter ). The oatmeal never fails to deliver.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|So the show only lasted two seasons, but Season 1 and Season 2 are a must have for my collection.  How you cannot be a fan of Joss Whedon's Firefaly and not Dollhouse I cannot understand.  Eliza Dushku leads a stellar class with an interesting and well written show.  It poses questions about technology and morality and I like that it makes you 'think'.  Some shows just occupy space but if a show gets you thinking about hard questions while entertaining you, its a rare treat.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very informative scholarly book that examines the factual evidence of Jesus of Nazareth.  This book explains how Christianity developed, which is not well known.  Well worth the read for historical purposes....
B004A2V3K0|4.0|If you are a Bon Jovi Fan, or you just like good music from years past, then you will recognize some of the hits and classics on this CD.  The price was right for me ($5) and I used to own some cassettes back in the 80's so I picked it up.  I would recommend it.
B009R659L8|3.0|This was an enjoyable read.  Although the ending felt bit rushed. I loved her previous books and compared to those books this one deserves a three star . But the MHC fans would like it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I opened this book, but I couldn't put it down. LOVED it!!!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|A compelling novel that beguiled and irritated equally but wouldn't release its hold. A book which makes you think, reflect and ponder the past, the Present and the future.
B0006J28BO|5.0|Love this movie, but can we get a rerelease already? I would love to buy copies if this movie as gifts, but it costs practically as much as a bluray to buy this now way out of date DVD. What the heck? This is one of my favorite movies and I would love to see it rereleased on bluray with proper Japanese subtitles. /endrant<br /><br />For those wondering about buying it, I highly recommend it! I have a sad feeling a bluray release isn't going to happen anytime soon, so don't wait! My family watches this often, and all kids seem to LOVE it! It's friendly, creative, funny, exciting, and has LOTS of cats :) (Kids seem to love cats, haha) It's one of my go to babysitting movies, and it hasn't failed me yet!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is, quite simply, one of the most unique and thought-provoking movies of all time. Originally released just six weeks after 9/11, the film - with its early scene of a jetliner's engine crashing through the roof of a suburban house and its open-ended questions about life and death - initially unsettled many people. On first viewing, you likely will find yourself left with more questions than answers. And therein lies the very goal of the film: to weave a tale that is so multi-faceted that second and third viewings let the viewer into the story that much more.<br /><br />The role of Donnie Darko is brilliantly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal. He completely transforms himself into the title role of Donnie. His sister (in the movie and in real life) is played by the delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal. The film opens with Donnie being found \\"asleep\\" on a golf course. And so the story begins. Patrick Swayze's performance as a self-help guru selling simplistic solutions (think Tony Robbins with a very, very dark side) shows the man's incredible versatility and his ability to commit to a role. Throughout the movie, constantly brilliant dialogue is intertwined with a soundtrack of 80's era pop that sets the scene perfectly. When Frank, the giant rabbit, first appears, what are we to make of him? Is he a medication-induced hallucination? A being from another dimension? Or something else, something running in parallel with Donnie's life? I think part of the answer lies in the exchange between Donnie and Frank: \\"Why are you wearing that stupid bunny suit?\\" \\"Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?\\"<br /><br />The Director's Cut restores some critical footage to the film, footage that helps flesh out some aspects of the story while also opening up other avenues for thinking about the story and its meaning. Bonus features include a \\"Darkomentary\\" about the cult following the film has garnered, that is quite an interesting watch as well. Donnie Darko is a film that I find myself watching again to look for new clues and theories. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy a movie that encourages thinking in new and interesting ways, Donnie Darko is for you.watching again to look for new clues and theories. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy a movie that encourages thinking in new and interesting ways, Donnie Darko is for you.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It always kept you guessing and yearning for more. Thanks John Grisham for such a great book.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I read this years ago; long time before the movie. This is the most thought-out and carefully structured book. It is the first book he wrote, although it was not the first to be published. Having read several of his later books before I read A Time to Kill, I noticed that this book was different...more subtle...more poignant, definitely one of his best.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|It's well designed and inspired. Love the magnetic link between the charging poles. Could be a little more scratch resistant, although it's wearing better than I expected.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book and all the twists and turns.....now starting with her first book and going to journey through her writings!
B00003CXFV|1.0|While the story may make for good drama, it has been shown that there was not an increased rate of cancer in the town of Hinkley, CA because of any leakage. So basically this was all a complete waste of time for everyone involved. The chromium that leaked into the water was not a large amount, and was determined not to be a hazard. Studies of cancer rates in the area showed the incidents to be lower than expected.<br /><br />It's hard to like this movie when one learns the facts.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Many filters, many frames, cool effects! I can do an amazing Pictures now!<br /><br />I thing that everyone who like to post their pictures in Instagram should to downlode this programm!<br /><br />XnView, Thank you!
B005XZHQKY|5.0|I bought this for my 3d LG tv this was the first 3D DVD I watched on my tv and it is great my dad likes it as well I highly recomend this for the price  I have only watched the first DVD I still have 2 more to go and I can't wait
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love historical fiction...the character development is rich. Costumes, scenery and dialogue are wonderful. six more words are required. word.
B0001I561E|5.0|Just what we expected. My husband and daughter loved it. Came like new would order again,  no problems at all.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I still remember watching them in concert when they only had the songs &#34;45&#34; and &#34;Fly from the Inside&#34; as their only songs on the radio.  These guys keep making hits, coming out with great albums, and put on a great show if you ever have the chance to see them live.  I have seen them live 6 times and they are better each time.  They always end with &#34;It's never goodbye...it's just till next time&#34; and that sums up their discography and careers so far. Great album!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great...! very easy to use.  Amazing product...!  When i get home from work i don't have to use my desk top computer to watch. Netflix..
B001MTENOC|5.0|This is an excellent and understandable read. I particularly related to the clinical approach, as it brought more authencity to the encounters.
1400032717|3.0|I actually work with kids who are on the ASD spectrum and while I found this book entertaining, I also found it merely a scratch below the surface of what it's all really about.  Additionally, the story itself was okay, mostly forgettable.  So yeah, good read, not amazing, not encompassing of the ASD experience, and in fact, I guess I worry that some people with little-no ASD experience will believe that it's all as simple as this.
B008M87GJK|1.0|I selected this rating because it would not work on my Kindle.<br />I was hoping it would work because I like to get the BBC news.  Having it on my Kindle would be a plus.
0786838655|4.0|Several people who know that I enjoy reading mythology recommended this series to me, and I am glad they did.  This is a fun fusion of Greek mythology and urban fantasy.  I felt that Riordan did a good job of capturing the character of the Greek gods.  He did slightly tone down some of their more unsavory aspects  since this is a children's book, but didn't fall into bowdlerizing.<br /><br />I enjoyed the author's writing style as well.  The narration has a light humorous tone that amuses without turning the story into a farce.  Some of the foreshadowing was glaringly obvious, but since this was a children's book I really didn't mind.  This definitely passes the C. S. Lewis test of good children's literature: \\"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.\\"
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Love it and can't wait for the next book to come out! I keep imagining the future for the town with different scenarios.
B009LDCXNY|4.0|Still not as great as the first 5, but the eighth season gives me hope that the show is getting back on track.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I rarely if ever give 5 stars, so I won't now. This movie had laughs (cute gags) and a few good 'belly laughs'. Ok, so the creators stretched a few historical 'things/concepts), but it was worth it, it was a cartoon! It even turned into a family movie when my teenage boy decided to watch and enjoy the movie (I caught him laughing). So sit back and enjoy the show, it was entertaining.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed reading the most recent GoT book. It was filled with twists and turns, excitements and disappointments, but now that I am up to date I am left with the same problem I had when the hbo series ended, when i decided to read the books: what happens next George? I am used to being left on a cliff hanger, but you left us on four of them! I can't wait for the next book, keep em' comin'
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I won't say i didn't like it (for 2 stars), so i have to give it 3. It is nothing like first one (IM 1). I know i enjoyed his roll in The Avengers better. Comparing this to IM2, well IM3 doesn't compare very well. Enough action for sure, but still it was missing something. I wonder if they will find 'it' in IM4? or maybe in the next Avengers movie, we shall see. As i said in the header, it's not painful to watch, it is entertaining, so enjoy, but lower your expectations before viewing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So glad I bought this game.  Only complaint is - I wish it was longer. I can't wait for the next one!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|wow what a show! I love fantasy and science fiction. this was drama, adventure, comedy...it covered it all.  best series i have followed in years. really loved Walter's character the hippie genius!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had it now for a week and keeps great time.  I wear it every day so there is no risk of it not winding up (automatic).  It looks great.  I'm not a blingy watch guy.  Glow in the dark works great, very bright! I can see the face at night.  The watch band is comfortable.  Very solid watch!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This has been a fun game with good hidden object screens, enough change in other puzzle types and fun story.  Did not have any problems with game function and THRILLED with the price.  Five stars for sure.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun and entertaining game.I say it is 5 stars because it has more than one character, cool hover boards, and just because it is fun.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love it never freezes or is slow. I could play it all day. My whole family has downloaded it. It's almost like it's a real live zoo
B00BT70J0Y|5.0|In my opinion, there were only two conductors who never made a single bad record.<br /><br />One was Arthur Fiedler. But, due to the extremely large number of records he made, I doubt that we will ever see a \\"Complete Arthur Fiedler\\" box set. (Who could afford it?)<br /><br />The other conductor in this exalted group was Fritz Reiner.<br /><br />The Reiner box set under discussion here is an absolute treasure. I shall not discuss the music, performance, and sound quality themselves about which there have been many, many reviews and articles written over the years; these are easy enough to find if you are interested. And anyone reading this review (or who is interested in this set) almost certainly already knows the quality of the music, the quality of the performances, and the quality of the sound recording. (If you are new to Fritz Reiner and are going to hear his performances for the first time, well, I envy you: you are in store for a real treat! You'll hardly believe your own ears!)<br /><br />Suffice it to say that all of the above characteristics are nothing short of superb, even transcendental. There may be some recorded performances of the included works which equal Reiner's but, at least in my experience, none - NONE - which surpasses them.<br /><br />You will need the included book (well-printed and very informative) to see what is on the individual discs; the back of the sleeves (cardboard reproductions of the original LPs complete with original notes in minuscule-sized - yet easily readable - print) and even the face of the CD itself may not be complete (the labels on the fronts of the CDs show only Side 1 of the LPs from which the CDs derive).<br /><br />The box which contains the CDs itself is made of heavyweight cardboard, beautifully printed in color, and is very space-efficient. It will look nice anywhere you choose to put it.<br /><br />At a person's request, I have placed the list of the recordings in Amazon's Classical Music Forums section within the thread entitled \\"New Fritz Reiner Box.\\"<br /><br />There will be some who will quibble about \\"faults\\" in the notes, \\"faults\\" in the remasterings, or \\"faults\\" in this or that. In my opinion, any \\"faults\\" in this set are trivial and really unimportant. (And when you hear the magnificence of the performance of the 'Eroica\\" you won't give a d--- whether it is mono or stereo!)<br /><br />Several of the same performances/recordings of works are repeated on two discs because they originally appeared on two separate LPs (the 1812 Overture, for example) but to my mind this is of no consequence. Also Reiner/Chicago recorded several works on two different occasions; both are included in this set. [See the fourth Comment appended to this review for more details.]<br /><br />The CD sides are short; one is even less than 30 minutes (as was the original LP). Again, this is of no consequence, at least to me.<br /><br />My only \\"quibble\\" is that I wish this set had been released in hybrid SACD/CD format (or, even better, as 24-bit 192kHz downloads). But even that is a minor point to me as I already own the 17 Reiner discs issued as SACDs (and, if you have SACD playback capability, I recommend that you buy them too even though the sound quality on the discs in this set are superior to any earlier 'Redbook' CDs of the same recordings which I myself have heard previously).<br /><br />I could also mention that it might have been nice had Sony included the \\"Carmen\\" which Reiner conducted in 1951 with the RCA Victor Orchestra (Risë Stevens, Jan Peerce, Licia Albanese, Robert Merrill, a \\"dream\\" cast if there ever was one!). I believe that it was his only complete opera recording.<br /><br />All that being said, I'll recommend that you just don't worry about any minor \\"quibbles.\\"<br /><br />I believe that you should just sit back and enjoy the music.<br /><br />I STRONGLY recommend that anyone interested in classical music BUY THIS SET. I believe that it will indeed become the one ofthe most important sets in your collection.<br /><br />A Personal Note: my parents gave an \\"RCA Victor New Orthophonic High Fidelity Record Player\\" (a blonde mahogany consolette on four legs) to me in the summer of 1956. It was my first record player which could play 33 1/3 and 45, as well as 78 RPM records. I can't tell you how happy I was. I thought it was the be-all and end-all of hi-fi!<br /><br />Though I had little money (being only 13 years old), I started buying records when I could. And I soon discovered that I had to \\"sneak\\" them in, something at which I became quite proficient (how about you?).<br /><br />On Sunday, February 17, 1957, my parents had some friends over and they all went out for the afternoon, leaving me home alone.<br /><br />Naturally, as soon as they left, I got onto my bicycle and rode across town to Dee's Appliances of Audubon, NJ to look at their records. (They sold records at 20% off list, in other words, $3.19 for a $3.98 record, a price irresistible to me.)<br /><br />An album cover caught my eye. It was RCA Victor LM-1999 Red Seal (SLP-13) and it was, of course, Fritz Reiner's recording of the 1812 Overture and other works. At that time I knew very little about classical music (I had never heard the 1812 Overture) but, because of that cover, I bought it. (Over the years I bought many albums because of the cover, almost always with similar luck! This cover is reproduced on two of the CDs in this set though it loses something of its impact in the small size.)<br /><br />With no one else being home, I was able to easily bring it into the house and play it.<br /><br />I loved it.<br /><br />I still have it.<br /><br />(Plus, over the years, I have acquired several stereo issues of it, now including the one in this set. That 1812 Overture performance, without cannon-fire and slightly abridged, is still the best performance of the work I have ever heard.)<br /><br />That's how I was introduced to Fritz Reiner. (Actually I had heard Fritz Reiner conduct before - I had the complete \\"The World's Greatest Music\\" on 78s and he conducted several of the works included - but, as the performers were not listed anywhere, I did not know this at the time.) So this one was my first \\"official\\" Fritz Reiner record - but by no means the last!<br /><br />There are other important record sets out there; the [[ASIN:B006VKKAWQ Arturo Toscanini: The Complete RCA Collection]] is one of them and there are many, many others. You wouldn't want to have just one classical set in your collection. Of course, you will also have a great many individual discs in a good collection but these sets are a convenient way to have music with some common thread (conductor, performer, composer, etc.) available to you in one place and at a relatively low price (and who cares if we have a few duplicates? Not me!).<br /><br />This [[ASIN:B00BT70J0Y Fritz Reiner-The Complete RCA Recordings]] one is certainly the new cornerstone of my own collection and, if you have read this far, I am quite certain it will become yours too. So I'll repeat: BUY THIS SET!<br /><br />Thank you for reading this.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Best villain ever in Star Trek, Khan, combined with intense action and great humor. Trek fans like me are still getting used to the alternative timeline, of course.
B0094K20FK|5.0|What can one say about Wrath of Khan.  Kirk and Spock at their greatest.  The Enterprise in a fight for survival and Genesis!  WOW!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Until 11/22/63 was announced I hadn't read a Stephen King book in about 25 years. I sucked down everything from Carrie to Tommyknockers. I thought - and never stopped thinking - he is a grossly underrated writer, but I go through phases with writers, try to learn their tricks.  When I think I've got those tricks down I go looking for someone with new tricks. But 11/22/63 was on a subject of particular interest to me, so I read it the day it came out and enjoyed it immensely. I didn't know what to expect from Dr Sleep but what I found was that old familiar voice. It's the voice of the kid you grew up with, whom you stayed friends with through years of not seeing each other, and who is as familiar and comfortable to you after years apart as he was when you went night crawling together a century ago. It was nice to see Dan Torrance again after all this time, and great to see Steve. This time we'll do a better job of staying in touch.
B005H0CBZ0|4.0|- but so far so good. It's certainly keeping my attention!! Thought maybe the 3rd book would be a 'bridge too far' but not so. Read on!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is probably a good game if you like to playstation games or pacman  types. I found it frustrating to manuver.
B008MM9630|4.0|farmville with a fairy twist.  unicorns, flying cows oh my!  not dependent on friends helping out to progress. could be addictive
1250029465|1.0|Liked the cat but I did not connect with the author.  I still think he is a very forgettable character.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|It was good but very different than expected.  It was worth renting and I would recommend it for Iron Man fans.
0061777269|1.0|Just to clarify some things. Pim van Lommel has exactly one co-authored original scientific publication and therefore should not be regarded as a scientist at all. Also \\"20 years of research on NDE\\" resulting in a single Lancet-paper (the critical comment's to which are an often ignored must-read) - were obviously not too busy scientific work. Some conclusions in that paper were obviously not covered by the presented data and from nowadays it appears strange that the manuscript actually made it into The Lancet. The transmission hypothesis of consciousness is by no way novel or innovative and it will never convince a critical mind as an endless consciousness is completely unable to explain the myriads of cases of temporary loss of consciousness with no extraordinary states of mind. I would recommend to buy a book of PvL on \\"How to make more money from little scientific output\\" - but not on such essential topics as the mind or the brain.

B008JFUQZ2|4.0|While the plot may be a bit thin, this is still an enjoyable movie with lots of action and some great effects. We enjoyed it.<br />My only complaint about this is the stupid Ultraviolet crap version instead of an actual digital copy. When will this crappy, useless Ultraviolet go away. If my son hadn't desperately wanted this movie I never would have purchased it due to the Ultraviolet. Join the rest of us in boycotting anything with Ultraviolet until sales are hurt enough that the studios stop putting Ultraviolet  on discs and calling it a &#34;digital version&#34; its is NOT it is simply a code that allows you to stream a movie ( in crappy quality and only over a high-speed connection) AFTER signing up for multiple accounts that require invasive information about you so that every spammer on earth gets your number...NO THANKS.

B004X2M3N8|5.0|Very Fun. Has a plot that is followed throught from one episoide to another. Love the entire show and actors
0544104404|2.0|The author has some good points about teaching children to persevere and work though life's challenges on their own. Absent from the character discussion was the foundation for decision making in the cardinal principles such as integrity. Without a sense of integrity there is no moral compass as a basis for good decision making and judgement.  The author proposes some good techniques and processes but does not get to the core of character building.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Very Fun. Has a plot that is followed throught from one episoide to another. Love the actors and the plot.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Liked the way the author weaver the story and kept it interesting until the very last page. I would highly recommend this book
B004A2V3K0|4.0|relaxing music, not something to clean the house to unless you LOVE Bon Jovi.  It's good when you just want to listen to music.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever I love playing this game when I have nothing to do it makes time go by faster.
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|smooth and intelligent sound. voice is sultry and cool and i found myself listening to it over and over again.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|The author kept up a very high speed throughout the book with barely an identifiable slackening. At times this was quite exhausting for the reader but at the same time the author must be congratulated on possessing the writing skills to sustain the story line. The content is quite implausible, often funny and cleverly linked in with major events in world history. My one serious criticism is that it is too long resulting in too much repetiion of frequently recounted actions. The editor's &#34;red pen&#34; could have been used heavily in the last 20% of the book with no detriment to the story line. Worth reading if you are searching for light reading in a holiday or when convalescing.
0307887448|5.0|The mix of 80's pop culture with a dystopian future made for an excellent read.  Would definitely recommend this to a friend!
B005R32L66|4.0|Lags a little compared to wifi on the computer, Other then that it works. Works good enough to get by.
1878424319|1.0|The book is impossible to understand. I didn't care for it at all. In no way do I see how this book give people personal freedom! I just ended up confused by it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My daughter touted me onto this book and being the sci-go fan that I am I tried it. AWESOME!  So much so, that I purchased the four other books in this series.  Can't wait to start on book 2 as soon as I finish writing this review.
1476734941|5.0|We (wife and I) started this life style almost 7 weeks ago. We are seniors, I am 5'10\\" in height and my weight has gone from 182 to 168 (in 7 weeks!) and my wife has lost 15 lbs. We were not obese, but were gaining a few pounds a year & I had excessive belly fat, high blood pressure, & was pre-diabetic. So far we have achieved the following.....Lower (healthy) blood pressure, lower blood sugar, I am losing belly fat, and would expect that more of our critical numbers will show positive improvement when we go in for physicals in the future. We both feel healthier already, we have more energy, and are blessed with the incredible satisfaction of having found something so simple that achieves such fabulous results! I've always wanted to maintain a healthy weight and improve my health but am not a real disciplined person so I never considered diet programs, etc. We just happened to watch this documentary on PBS one evening and this FastDiet as it is called, just hit home with us.  And other than buying the book, there is no cost to it....in fact you actually save money on the food & drink that you don't consume during the fasting days. Our achievements so far have come from simply fasting on Monday & Thursday each week during the last 7 weeks. My wife does the partial fast from the book & I fast for the entire day. So other than the 2 fasting days, we eat & drink whatever we want the other 5 days of the week. We have honestly been amazed (it's just been 7 weeks!) at the simplicity of the diet and the results we have achieved so far. I don't mean to make this sound like a walk in the park, it does take some will power & you need to want to achieve these results to the point that you persevere in that will power, but even though we had never even considered the idea of not eating for a day, either temporarily or on a sustained basis, this has turned out to be  much easier than either of us had thought it would be. I enthusiastically encourage anyone & everyone to consult with your doctor about this and if s/he gives you the go ahead, embark on this diet as a life style for both good physical health and to maintain a healthy weight. It works!!! Here is a link to the documentary that we originally saw on PBS that made us aware of this diet/life style....... [...]  We hope you consider this & will succeed as we have & share with others....this is transforming our lives & together with you, I believe we could transform the health & well being of many, many people!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love the Harry Potter Series. I am pleased with this set. Is is just as described. I am happy that it it the complete set ; perfect for collectors and enthusiasts alike. I definitely recommend it.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|I have not personally seen this as I had it sent to my grandson but his dad tells me that he is very happy with it. He has several other models of Bruder trucks and fortunately the one I got him was one that he didn't already have.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|Pearl Jam is a band at its best fighting something: drummers, corporations, politicians, social issues, etc. They built a reputation upon owning a disdain for greed and materialism. They are fierce competitors when they have something to prove. They 'outshined' countless other grunge bands, and seemed to be on a mission to prove they were in it for the music. At the height of their fame, they hosted local bands for their pirate radio broadcasts, sued Ticketmaster, were deceived by the journalism industry which staged a rivalry between Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder, and yet through all of this conflict involuntarily established a brand.<br /><br />While there may have not been any bloodshed between Eddie and Kurt, the bands certainly inspired each other to do more. The organic sound of that era was something that was organically grown in the Seattle grass roots grunge scene, they all imitated each other. Fast forward to 2013 and Pearl Jam is a band that has persevered and thrived while most of their once competition have vanished. While it's easy to criticize, there is no doubt they are still very influential. They still sell out stadiums and arenas. Pearl Jam is alone at the top of their class.<br /><br />The rest of this review is not going to be so nice, but it is coming from a fan of two decades who saw his first show in 1992.<br /><br />Today Pearl Jam is a band with nothing/nobody to fight, the passion which once helped create their legendary rock status is rock history. While most tracks on the Vitalogy album were improvised in twenty minutes before they were recorded, Lightning Bolt took four years to record. Unlike the past, Pearl Jam has amassed a wealth of financial resources and can now produce their own albums on their own time. While having the luxury of recording music sans producers, executives, deadlines, music is a second priority. It's nice to produce new material with full artistic control, but this effort is just forcing it.<br /><br />It sounds like Pearl Jam has become what they hated, a band that rocks Oracle company conferences who make up for low album sales with touring constantly. The music went from an intense, intimate catharsis to a rock-for-rocks-sake style of poppy-punk filler tracks. Since Matt Cameron has come aboard, the organic PJ \\"sound\\" has been hijacked by an unnatural up-tempo beat, with a snare drum that sounds like a machine. They've replaced the groovy guitar licks and bass lines with an ambient keyboard to fill in the weak instrumentals. Mike McCready's solo production has devolved into a generic production line scale pecking that begs the question of is this the same human being who created the \\"Alive\\" solo?<br /><br />Pearl Jam Inc. has done a much better job with marketing posters and \\"bootlegs\\" to their cult-like fan base than producing meaningful music for the past decade. Mind Your Manners was released early like Given to Fly back in 1998, except this time the buzz just is a coordinated PR campaign. They even made a cheesy music video with flannel-clad Ed mock singing over fragile, double-tracked vocals. None of these songs are worth a discussion. There are no \\"classics\\" on the album, like any of the past three albums, which only fade in relevance as more albums are released.<br /><br />It is apparent from first listen to Lightning Bolt that Pearl Jam is going through the motions. The generic title should be a clue of the theme of the album, as if this was printed on a banner inside the studio to attempt to speed up the four year process. A motivational slogan may have produced a couple of sub-par tracks about mortality, but it is guarded lyrically. The band is making a sincere effort to evolve from the sound of the past, except none of these tracks would have made the cut on the band's first five albums, or the second cut.<br /><br />Ed Vedder has given the band too much freedom and while this democratic method is keeping them together, they are accepting a product below theirhistoric standards. Vedder's solo music is reminiscent of the soul that once possessed Pearl Jam. He's not the dictator he once was, and this album is more on par with a Stone Gossard side project than a band that once was on par with the gods of rock. This is an album by sober, middle aged guys who stopped listening to the critics. Unfortunately, some of those criticisms were valid.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have enjoyed the books that I have got from Kindle and the information has helped me in my studies as a Christian.
1451673442|5.0|This is a great book.  I liked it so much that i re-ordered and purchased more to give to friends and family that I knew would enjoy it.  They did enjoy it!!
1475143389|5.0|Great read. Loved the articles. The beginning chapters were a little repetitive and boring but just because I wanted to get to the heart of the book and start my training. Great book to have in your work out arsenal. Helping me tons. Mike wants you to get a basic knowledge of eating habits and always keep your mind focussed and thinking about why your working out, what your eating and sometimes less is better. I highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun! My kids and I all love it! Very addicting, though. Once you start playing it's very hard to stop!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This helped me NOT to sleep, again, just like the Shining did, so many years ago. Loved finding out what happened to Danny Torrance.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Great record !  I love the collaborations . My favorite was Fortunate Son. That song still has power and that's how they played it .
B004FHP9KA|1.0|Couldn't find much else of interest, but shouldn't have bothered to watch.  No story should be so complicated to tell or difficult to follow.  I turned it off about 30 minutes in.
B0030ZOYHC|1.0|We aware! the movie was amazing, the quality of the CD and its content is great but the package is very cheap, is not the original version.<br />I feel robed by amazon! I bought it because I wanted to own the original, otherwise I would have downloaded the movie from piratebay. I want my money back or the original sent to me!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Deleted everything off of my kindle and this game still will NOT work. Very disappointed because it says its on 30 some MB. Will change my review when this &quot;bug&quot; gets fixed. Would be nice to play it seeing how I just cleaned everything else out.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Awesome movie! Really unique approach to story telling.  Amazing graphics.  Streams really well to my xbox.  Hoping for a sequel!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love love love this series. I am not sure if there is a new season yet but I hope there is. I cannot wait and I'm so excited.
B0080K3CYI|3.0|I have been meaning to read this for some time so was a little disapointed as so much explored the geography of the story rather than the journey.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that there are so many versions with easy access.  And I especially love that many of the versions have an audio option.  It is wonderful to just be able to listen to the Bible being read to me.  Can't believe that it's free, and am so grateful for it.  Amazing, absolutely amazing, and I'll be telling everyone at my Bible study about it too.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Funny, poignant and clever - best book Ive read in a long time. Ive recommended it to everyone I know!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Let's face it, KoRn has a sound that is unmistakeable so to say that the albums that didn't include Head didn't sound like KoRn is quite a stretch.  On the other hand, there is no doubt that his absence was felt by the band and the fans, but that's over now.  This album really shows what they can do when they are a complete, solid unit with everyone excited about the music.  I consider this as kind of the 2.0 version of their \\"Korn III\\" album, their first with drummer Ray Luzier.  The enthusiasm and raw energy that came from adding Ray is here again, and even more, with Head's return.  The opening track comes at you full speed ahead, and track after track they find ways to push themselves in new ways while staying true to their signature sound.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the electronic elements they've started using but I think on this album they did it in clever ways by adding touches of it instead of making it more of the main feature like they did on \\"Path of Totality\\".  A lot of fans were confused when the first single \\"Never Never\\" came out, and that was no surprise to singer Jonathan Davis who said \\"We put this out first 'cause I knew it was going to piss off a lot of people. And um, so I did it. That song ain't for dudes, it's for the ladies.\\"  Obviously he knew that the album was strong enough to have a little fun.  When \\"Love And Meth\\" came out, it proved that fans had nothing to worry about.<br /><br />\\"Lullaby for a Sadist\\" is among my favorites, mostly for the chrous with its playful, bouncy melody that reminds me of Shoots and Ladders\\" from their first album.  When I saw the preview video of the band in studio with Head, the music parts came from \\"Lullaby\\" and I was hoping that would end up on the album.  All in all, there are no \\"filler\\" tracks on this album, every song has its place and showcases a different element of the band.  Even after only a few listens, it's easily my favorite since \\"Issues\\".  A great album, not only for longtime fans of the KoRn but people who are just learning about them.the KoRn but people who are just learning about them.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Everything I expected. Supernatural is a quality show that we will watch again and again. I can't wait for the next season
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Episodes are thought provoking and character development continues.  I am not burned out even at the end of four seasons.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|No long drawn out reviews here.  If you read the first two books in the series you will want to read this one.  It keeps your interest and it is a page turner , but it seems like it was written more for high school age kids than an adult. It was a little insulting to me.  If you want to know the end of the hunger games read it, other wise I would skip it.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Always a good book to read and be thankful we're not in an environment like that.read in high school and was a great book at the time and still is a great book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Makes you think about strategies and allows you to cancel your moves to improve you winning capabilities. I love this game and definitely recommend it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I CAN LEARN AND REVIEW WITH THIS APP BETTER THAN ANY METHOD I HAVE SEEN.  IT HAS EVERYTHING WHICH TRIGGERS MY LONG TERM MEMORY.  THANK YOU DUOLINGO
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I find her books interesting, and that they can draw me in - but it has much more to do with her ability to create characters and develop them in ways that bring you into their thoughts and feelings.  The story kept my interest and was unpredictable.<br />I did not like that it left a very critical part of the story unexplained.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Wonderful pognant tale of a man's love for his dog- and viceversa.Not the usual Richard Gere pablum. Great story for the family.
B00DP8XSQ2|3.0|A nice app. A night view feature that lights up in red, so as not to ruin your night vision,<br />however the ever present banner ads that keep on the screen, with a white background, ruin<br />it's use. I do or would suspect that the ads would go away with a pay for version.
B008D37SGU|4.0|It was a romantic, yet heartbreaking, movie.  It was a woman's journey for true love, and she risked everything to obtain it.  Flashbacks were intertwined with present day in a manner that was, at times, disjointed.  The acting was wonderful, and I would've enjoyed even more dialogue to further explore the characters' relationships with each other.  It thoroughly explored the dark side of love, and I really ached for Hester (Rachel Weisz's character).  It was a good tearjerker, so remember your tissues!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Put one foot in front of the other. Persevere. This novel starts at a walking pace, but as you progress on your journey with Harold Fry you will encounter surprises and verbal treasures. You may find yourself creating fictions...
B00BFV1K0M|4.0|Look, first and foremost, it's a good read. The action moves along at a mach pace, and it's easy reading.<br /><br />The main character can be a little grating a times with her wild emotions - never before have I wanted so much to sit a character down and tell them the phrase, &#34;When you assume, you make an ASS out of U and ME.&#34; The flip-flopping of her emotions is extended to boys in the story as well, Peeta and Gale, and this can be quite frustrating to read as an adult... But I suppose that comes with the territory.<br /><br />In terms of the writing, it's very functional. Structure and deftly timed cliffhangers/shocking moments hook you in and keep you there. It's admittedly hard to put down because of this. Make no mistake about it though, there is very little poetry to Collins' prose, and even less left for the reader to piece together in terms of the significance of the various characters' actions. Almost as if Collins' doesn't believe her audience capable of piecing things together, she spells everything out in exhaustive detail, lest you perhaps not fully understand the implications of what has happened; this may be a result of the demographic she's writing for, however I personally think it's a bit overkill.<br /><br />All told, Catching Fire is a fun, exciting read that segues very nicely into the final installment in the trilogy.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Not sure what some people were expecting but this movie delivered on the classic monster action flick.  Big bad monsters, big bad heros.  Watch it with my son who loves it.
B008EKOIN8|1.0|Not a favorite read.  Too much like a textbook for me.  Still trying to make my way through this book.
0316228583|1.0|It is rare that I do not finish reading a novel.  I tried to persevere to the end of A Casual Vacancy but absolutely could not!  This book was dreadfully boring to say the least!  I would have more fun putting together a jigsaw puzzle of a basketball then to force myself to finish reading this book.  A tooth extraction would be more fun!  If this is how people in a small English town live I would rather not visit it even in a fictional story.  I won't drone on and on about it.  If you have read it you know what I'm talking about, and if you haven't don't bother wasting your time.  Granted JK Rowling did a fantastic job writing the Harry Potter books, I think she would be better off staying in the genre of children's fantasy books.  Good luck next time Ms. Rowling.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is amazing, I couldn't put it down!!!!! Great for anyone who lives a good love story! Left me wanting more!

B00006L9ZT|5.0|Starting with the general: If I could own only one copy of the Ring Cycle, it would be this one. Why? It's the one most true to Wagner's original intent, which is not to say that it's perfect. It does have some less than perfect moments. The good and the bad are, in some respects, intertwined and from the same causes.<br />  The stage scenery makes excellent use of technology, while remaining true to realistic representations of the era and area.<br />  Because this rendition is so true to Wagner's original, it eschews the glitzy types of special effects, while still using current technology, to improve the representations and moods Wagner was trying to present. Could it have made better and/or more frequent use of technology, while still remaining true to the author's intent? Yes.<br />  Let's dissect the opera, using examples, from each of its parts.<br />  In Das Rheingold, technology is used, very effectively, to represent the underwater environment of the Rhine Maidens, as well as the caves of the Neibelung and the depiction of Valhalla, without compromising the story line or its effective representation.<br />  When we get to Die Walküre, technology is properly used, in some instances, such as:<br />  1) to provide realistic, yet true-to-form, representations of Hunding's hearth,<br />  2) detailed scenery, for the battle scene, between Hunding and Siegmund and<br />  3) the firewall, surrounding Brünnhilde's mountaintop banishment stead.<br />  My first reaction, upon seeing Hildegard Behrens, in the part of Brünnhilde, was that she did not have the physical stature to pull it off. Was I mistaken! While she is not of Amazonian stature, her acting more than made the role believable and she carried it off, without a hitch.<br />  Technology could, also, have been better used, to represent \\"the ride,\\" more in concert with Wagner's vision of the Valkyries' ethereal and high-energy movements. In that travesty version of The Ring Cycle (you know, the one with the \\"moving fingers wall\\"), the one positive aspect was the vision applied to \\"the ride,\\" which gave it a sense of forward movement and charging steeds. The best \\"ride,\\" however, is still the one in which the Valkyries are mounted, on steeds, then projected, ghost-like, on the screen, as a semi-transparent overlay. That version, in my opinion, provides the nearest thing to Wagner's true intent, although the technology of his day didn't and couldn't provide that view. That technology was used, with much less impact, in Siegfried, to represent Erda, when she was reawakened, by Wotan. Why not use it in \\"the ride?\\"<br />  Moving on, to Siegfried, the depiction of Mime's cave is a good use of technology, while technology seems to have been completely forgotten, when we get to the depiction of Fafner, as a dragon. That dragon looked more like a genetic cross, between a spider and a crab, with a tail.<br />  Lastly, we've arrived at Götterdämmerung. It was performed almost flawlessly. The scene of Siegfried's murder, his wake and funeral were excellently portrayed, as was Hagen's unmasking, as the ultimate culprit and schemer. The only thing, which I think could have made it better, would have been to see Brünnhilde ride into Siegfried's funeral pyre, mounted on Grane, rather than jumping into it.<br />  Just as an aside: I find it ironic that James Levine should become the most potent and accurate interpreter, within the last 100 years, of the music of a virulently anti-Semite, such as was Wagner.
B005JE1JZC|5.0|This is one series I have come to simply adore. After finishing the Farseer series, I still longed to get back into the world. I did not want to go for Liveship traders, for some reason I did not want to read about some other protagonist - I wanted Fitz and the Fool and Chade and Kettricken and Burrich- and they are all here, in addition to absolutely delightful characters like Thick and Nettle. I have not been drawn into a world to this extent since LoTR. And to top it off, Robin has announced the Fool's Assassin - yet another series with hopefully the same characters. Can't wait!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Well, with ARTPOP less than a month away, I figure it's time to review Lady Gaga's third and, at the time of writing this, most recent album, Born This Way. I have a lot to say about this album before I do my usual run-down of each individual song, so I hope you'll pardon the wall-of-text. First of all, if any of you followed Gaga for quite some time now, you'd know that this album had an insane amount of hype built up for it. Gaga started talking about this album as early as March of '10. For those keeping score, that's before Alejandro even released as a single. From then on out, she teased songs from the album several times in the coming months. Because she wanted to finish her Monster Ball Tour before releasing the album itself, she ended up releasing three singles to further build up hype.<br /><br />When the album finally came out, it was during a somewhat low point in my life, and I hadn't listened to any Gaga in nearly a year, so hearing these new songs really cheered me up. I listened to the radio a lot back then, and my local pop station was playing tons of Gaga in celebration of this new album, which sort of re-kindled the crush I'd had on her years earlier. So, did it live up to all the hype? Let's take a look at each song and find out.<br /><br />Marry the Night: Though this was the first song on the album, it was actually the fifth and final single. It's a song about not letting life get you down, and instead seizing the day(or marrying the night?) and living life to its fullest. It sounds phenomenal and quickly became one of my favorite songs on the album. The music video isn't half-bad, either!<br /><br />Born This Way: This is the one that everyone has heard, regardless of whether they're a Gaga fan or not. It's the title track as well as the lead single, a first for Lady Gaga. You could argue that Katy Perry, Ke$ha, and Pink all sent a similar message with \\"Firework\\", \\"We R Who We R\\", and \\"Raise Your Glass\\" respectively, but I think Gaga pulled off the \\"self-respect anthem\\" the best. She's been a proud LGBT rights activist ever since The Fame, and this song served to solidify that even further. It's incredibly catchy, and I think even someone who doesn't care for Gaga might enjoy this track.<br /><br />Government Hooker: You know, I'm honestly not sure what message this song was trying to send, but it could perhaps be, well, how corrupt the government is? It's a generally fast song that goes back and forth from sounding happy and bouncy to dark and serious. The chorus is particularly driving and I consider it the best part. This isn't one of my favorites on the album, but I still like to listen to it.<br /><br />Judas: For all the praise I've given Lady Gaga up until now, this is where I must give criticism instead. You can say that I have no taste, you can say that I'm not a \\"true fan\\", or anything else you want to say, but this is my unbiased opinion. Judas is the worst song on this album. Not only that, it's Lady Gaga's worst song overall. Considering how solid the rest of this album is, I truly don't know what went wrong here. This song sounds and feels like something that was originally supposed to be given to Britney Spears or some other generic pop artist, but was passed off to Gaga at the last minute. It isn't very catchy, and the overload of religious references in the lyrics make it very uncomfortable to listen to. I generally don't like the way it sounds, and the music video is rather lackluster to boot. Why she chose this as her second single is beyond my comprehension. I seem to be alone in my opinion of this song, as I've heard many fans call it their favorite, or at least one of them(sometimes the same people who will shun songs such as Brown Eyes or I Like It Rough). Thankfully, this is where my negative thoughts toward this album end.<br /><br />Americano: Another one of the best songs on the album. Gaga really shows off her vocal range and prowess here, and the acoustics in the instrumentalcomplement it well. It's another political commentary-ish song, but makes itself a lot more apparent than Government Hooker did.<br /><br />Hair: This promotional single is another fantastic one! Lyrically, It's undeniably happy and uplifting, and the instrumental is one of the best on the album. Many fans consider this a very relatable song.<br /><br />Scheisse: (I don't have German characters on my keyboard) I literally can't get enough of this song. It's my second-favorite from this album, and it's an upbeat, powerful feminist anthem that even a dude like me can appreciate. Parts of the song are sung in fake-German as an analogy to how many people hear feminists as speaking gibberish.<br /><br />Bloody Mary: I know I'll sound a bit contradicting when I say I love this song after I just ranted on Judas, but this one doesn't shove the religious reference in your face as much as that song did, and it sounds loads better! It's a bit slower paced than the other songs, but catchy nonetheless. It has a very creepy, ethereal vibe to it, and the scream after the chorus really catches you off-guard the first time.<br /><br />Bad Kids: A happier-sounding song than the last two, this one's sort of an anthem for all the would-be revolutionaries of this generation. I enjoyed this one quite a bit as well, as it stands out quite well from the rest of the album.<br /><br />Highway Unicorn (Road to Love): The first romantically-themed song on the album, and yet another one of my favorites. To me, this song always had some Cher vibes to it, which is never a bad thing. It has a very happy, positive feel to it that should be able to lift anyone up.<br /><br />Heavy Metal Lover: With prominent elements of techno and rock in the instrumental, this song kinda takes you by surprise. It's another love song with some interesting double entendres in the lyrics. Incredibly driving and danceable.<br /><br />Electric Chapel: This song sports some more evident electric guitar than the last song and features a very \\"pulsating\\" beat that goes well with the romantic lyrics. It seems like she put all the love songs on this album right next to each other, and it really adds nice pacing to the whole thing.<br /><br />You and I: By far, this is my favorite song on the album. Harkening back to \\"Brown Eyes\\", \\"Again, Again\\", \\"Speechless\\", and the feel of her older music in general, this lovely rock-piano ballad is not to be overlooked. It's a staple of hers to have at least one of these on every album, and I'm glad she finally decided to release one as a single(the fourth for this album, to be precise). It features a well-used sample of Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\", and the song has a sweet, endearing feeling to it. This is something I'd suggest to anyone who tries to say Lady Gaga can't sing.<br /><br />The Edge of Glory: The last song on the album, as well as the second single. This one is about living out the last night of your life, with a nice, romantic touch to it. This was one of my favorite songs throughout most of 2011, and rightfully so. It has some deep meaning to it, yet still manages to be catchy and dance-worthy. The music video for this song is easily the best out of the five, and she looks positively beautiful in it. The saxophone in the instrumental sounds great as well!<br /><br />Born This Way (Jost & Naaf Remix): The sole bonus track on the standard edition. It's a very dance-oriented remix to the title track that somehow manages to be even catchier than the original. A nice extra addition!<br /><br />Final thoughts - This is the album that Lady Gaga wanted to be her best, and most, if not all of her fanbase generally agrees. While I don't think it quite outdid The Fame (Which is my favorite pop album overall), I still consider it a fantastic record. There was a lot of controversy over Amazon initially selling this record for 99 cents each, but I think it can be overlooked considering that it sold rather well even without those figures. I'll givethis record five stars because I don't think one bad song is enough to bring it down, though it's still her only song so far that I outright disliked. I actually did see Lady Gaga live at the Born This Way ball at the start of this year, where I was treated to live versions of all these songs as well as her older songs, and it was an absolute music lover's dream! In summary, if you enjoyed Gaga's previous work, this is definitely something to pick up!and features a very \\"pulsating\\" beat that goes well with the romantic lyrics.

B005HED11Y|5.0|This is the update classic trek deserved. By taking the entire series back to the masters and original models and seamlessly integrating modern cgi without losing the feel that it had originally while allowing for even greater detail than ever possible.<br /><br />Only thing, and it's rare that it happens, is that given that trek was originally in a full screen format it's a little jarring in the one or two episodes where the remastered space scenes are in wide screen, though even this wouldn't lead me to knocking off even a tenth of a star.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|The insider savvy about the Washington game adds much muscle to this show, but some poor writing and cheap tricks drag it down. Spacey talking to the camera--he's no Don Cheadle--is a huge mistake. It's condescending to the audience, and no good can come of it--this ain't Shakespeare. Better writing, a few well-placed captions, and the judicious use of a Fifth Business at Frank's side, would make this \\"expository\\" (explaining to the audience) and \\"confessional\\" device unnecessary. Tho they do their clever best to keep things moving when Frank is taking us into his confidance, it's merely a show-stopper, in a bad way--it breaks character.  When the icky unlikable sh muck is not doing it, you don't miss it, but then, achhh, he's at his cuteness again, and it's like the \\"story\\" is once again driving with the brakes on.  Another gripe I have, as with the hi-ly overrated filthy-mounted \\"The Wire\\", is the effusive use of the eff word, at least in the first several episodes (it seems to have petered out a bit as the season played out. I say this, by the way, not at all prudishly. Certain characters, the writer(s) feel, MUST use the eff word, not once, not twice, but over and over. I've made a game of timing when the next \\"eff\\" will get delivered, and I've been rarely wrong.<br /><br />There's some good writing too. The childfree/childless marriage of Claire and Frank, each possessing the other's somewhat enabling \\"permission\\" to cheat, is writ with layers, nuances, and much nascent drama--that is, it reeks of truth. Best part of this show for me is that Netflix is competing with the Hollywood studios in supplying internet-ready content, bypassing the cable TV companies (except for your having to buy internet servce from them to begin with). Hoping the writers will rid themselves of their precious \\"asides\\" for Frank, or anyone else, and ease of their tuckered out effs, and write the good stuff most of this show contains. It's fundamentally a good production, and potentiallya great one.
B006WMILQU|2.0|I just watched a few minutes. It is not the type of the movie I was looking for. Maybe others like it.

B005CYLG5W|1.0|this is just horrible<br />a great concert but picture and sound quality don't even reach vhs this is worse than a bootleg. amazon should'nt sell this rubbish. it's a absolute rip off DON'T BUY this
B008MM9630|1.0|I'm extremely addicted to this game but the last few days my purchases have not been given to me. Amazon says they were received but the game never gave me them and no one responds on their help email.<br /><br />Other than that very fun and addictive game. Tasks are easy to understand as they have pictures with the riddles and most of the expensive items or animals you earn free as you level up.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book ruins  it all for me! How could they let prim die. Pretend gale just went away? Peeta and katniss have 2 kids. Finnik dies.Buttercup comes looking for prim. I love this book cause it gives me a sense of completion though. Still made me cry, an  I never cry at books!
B00ELIKDXG|5.0|The Lollipop: Adventure Two by Julia Gousseva is a wonderful story that is excellently written and fun. Who doesn't like to write their own ending in a story?<br /><br />In traditional fairytale style, the author has created a marvelous book that all will enjoy. The tale has an ending, but the children in this story get to create it when the words disappear from the pages.<br /><br />From the talking fish to the great Leshi and many more wonderful characters, this story is full of inspirational ideas in how to deal with problems and the creative solutions are very simple.<br /><br />I love this short read for all ages and highly recommend it. 5 stars for The Lollipop: Adventure Two
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I really expected much more from Weber.  As a die hard Phantom of the Opera fan I hoped that the story and the music were at least as good.  Disappointed.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal (A World War 2 Thriller) by Damian Stevenson: I recently fell in love with Bond after `Skyfall' and have since read some of the original Ian Fleming novels.<br /><br /> `Operation Parsifal' shed light on Fleming's early career as a spy for me and taught me a lot about World War 2.<br /><br /> The plot kept me reading late into the night for the past few days. The story moved fast and the action left me breathless. I am off to read `Operation Armada' - I hope it is as good as this.<br /><br />5 stars for an Awesome Read
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I was so glad to get this on sale at last.  It is wonderful on the whole.  I am disappointed that it is missing the episode The Menagerie. Otherwise it met my expectations as a lifelong Trekkie

B004JN1D2I|2.0|Just like Lord of the Rings, the show is better than the books. Same plot, just doesn't take as long to get there.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br />Also, I don't really buy the fact that this kid king didn't get whacked within a week of taking the throne. Please!
0446310786|5.0|I didn't read this until I was 24 years old. When I did, I fell in love with it. I wish Harper Lee had written other books, because her writing style is one of my favorites. She did an amazing job with this book. And I absolutely love Scout... she's one of my most favorite characters out of every book I've ever read. (And I've read a lot of books.)
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's been a long time since I said Oh man didn't see that coming! I won't spoil it, in case you haven't seen the movie yet but the end is a definite WOW moment.<br /><br />Also, don't mess with Earth.
B000MGATTE|4.0|Lisey lost her husband, and now has to face the rest of her life without him.  I had the hardest time even starting this book because of that premise.  But once I did, I didn't want to put it down.  I wanted to find out what happened to Lisey & her sisters, how she'd deal with her husband's crazy, evil uberfan, and what had happened to her husband, Scott, when he was a boy and Booya Moon.<br /><br />As typical of many of Mr. King's books, the characters are so wonderfully drawn, you feel like you know them, and miss them when the book is over.  However, there are also some seriously goofy bits.  Still, you put it all together, and it's a good book, hard to put down.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|Ender's Game was awesome, but this new hippy &#34;if you dream it you can do it&#34; stuff is just terrible. Hey I know, if we imagine we exist outside the universe, we can travel instantly to anywhere.<br /><br />Huh???
B00826B65M|5.0|It's an excellent book which compiles all the Comedie humaine which is difficult to have in paper books. I recommen it very much.
B005PK56TA|4.0|If your a fan of horror, you'll love this fresh approach to the Haunted House genre. The writting and cast is superb! Jessica Lange has come a long way from King Kong, her protrayal of Constance Langdon is a joy to watch, she transforms from sickly, sweet grandma type to a dangerous, manipulating she-bitch in a blink of an eye. Dylan McDermott captures the essence of a confused and troubled soul and the bitter, sneeringly distrustful daughter played by Taissa Farmiga is fantastic. She's ghost-like from the beginning, a small doll face floating inside a hood of shoulder length, dirty blond hair<br /> My only disappointment with the cast is the Mother, Vivien played by Connie Britton. She just doesn't seem to hold up her end in comparrison to the others and some of her close ups reveal a much older woman than protrayed.<br /> I've watched both seasons so far and am beginning the third with great anticipation, you wont be disappointed and will probably become a dedicated fan
0399159347|2.0|OMG this book sucks so bad.  I'm definitely not going to finish it.  Not onlythat ithasleft a lingering bad memory of how utterly lame thisbook i.  It's like feeling continually naseaus.  I have never been angry after reading a book but I feel duped by the positive reviews because it'sveryhardto believethey are genuine.  The big secret is dragged out so long I almost didnt care.  My apologiez to the author for thisrange.  Just trying to save othersan unpleasant experience.

B00BEIYL6G|1.0|Only partial biography, inaccuate historical events, and Kutchner should stick to modeling underwear...lousy acting as title character and feel sorry for the real actors who were dimished by being in this mess with him in the lead role.

0446547638|5.0|I had to give this book 5 stars. It was a book I couldn't put down until I finished. I think it makes a person really think about their lives and how things could have been. I was shocked and so saddened at how the book had finished. I am a sucker for happy endings and this book just bothered me by the way it ended. It's a story about true love and how things don't always end up the way you expect. If you love love stories, and aren't bothered by sad endings, then this book is for you.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Fun overall.  Time restraints make advancing quick my difficult.  But the kids are enjoying it.  I would like to be able to play the mini games as often as we want.
B0000844I8|5.0|Good movie and excellent quality with full features and access. I had originally recorded this movie on VHS so this DVD replaced the old recording but with all the pluses off a DVD.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Well this app is not working and by the looks at the other comments, not working for them to. Anyone from kik read these? Do they care? Makes me wonder.
B000SVZIDA|4.0|I ordered this with expedited shipping yet it still took several days to get to me. However, I love the movie and will not complain. This was my second ordering of this movie from this seller for the first time I got a region two copy of the movie. I suppose it was just the luck of the draw because this one came region one with no issues.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It does not work I can't watch any videos<br />It keeps on loading if the creators are reading this please fix this
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love it. It's supernatural whoooo. I love supernatural. I liked this season so I decided to get this season too.
1452101248|5.0|This is a beautiful book, the pictures alone make it suitable for reading in bed as food porn. The recipes I've tasted have been superb and make me want to go through the entire book end-to-end. I'm a dedicated amateur cook; I find that the book is full of ideas I haven't tried yet, and it makes me want to get into the kitchen and get to work. Very highly recommended.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|Got this for him for Christmas along with a new Blu-ray player.  He loves this movie and went nuts for it on Blu-ray.
B00FHG19T8|4.0|I just love to put it on and chill out...  The song with Patty Griffin is pretty great.  Check it out!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Got this for a present for my sister. She loves the movie and is impressed with the extra features included.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one great game I originally downloaded it for my grandchildren but I ended up playing mostly m myself I even tried to get family as nd friends to join I really l o 've it.I would tell everyone so relaxing and also uses you mind.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was one of the novels I've always wanted to read.  I'm glad I did!  I don't think a movie could clearly do this justice.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This did not live up to Mr. Hosseini's first book, The Kite Runner, which I loved.  I still have to read his 2nd book, but I read this book with my bookclub.  This would be better considered as a collection of short stories...the chapters do not integrate well.<br /><br />I and my bookclub were disappointed, and feel the book was not well edited...maybe it should be changed to a collection of short stories around a common theme, around certain characters.
B00AWFEBDK|4.0|Here is another book by Diamond at once erudite and intriguing. There is enough scientific data for the scientist but explained in layman's terms.<br /><br />Fascinating insights into traditional societies and more than enough challenges to Westerners to take another look at how civilized (or should that be uncivilized) they really are.<br /><br />Read and enjoy. I was sorry when the book ended.
B005LAIIGW|2.0|Gravity is aptly named, for it is indeed a drag.  It's a boring spectacle based on a story we've seen countless times, stranded travelers. Sandra Bullock plays an emotionally tortured astronaut, and George Clooney, playing himself, is her partner. They're trapped in nothingness, and so are we. Imagine a galactic waiting room with a few explosions, some floating, and lots and lots of breathing. That's Gravity.  Oh, and they press lots of buttons in space machines.  Forget suspense, tension, and drama, despite the main character's internal struggle and perilous circumstances. The title has more twists than the film. (Gravity as in physical science and as in heightened danger?  Clever.) There simply isn't enough happening to make this an interesting film. There's a strong woman at the core, fighting against the odds and all that, but as a movie, it's flat.  Ripley she is not. (Actually, if that alien that got blown out of the airlock had shown up in Gravity, we might've had a film!) The effects are fine, but nowhere near as impressive as the hype suggests, which is also true of the film itself.  They made this movie at sea a few years ago and called it Open Water.  If you saw that, you've seen Gravity.  Just substitute flying space junk for sharks. On the plus side, Gravity is short, so the suffering is brief. I wanted to like it, but Gravity brought me down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Defiantly love playing this game, made for everyone at any age! Might fall out of your seat while you are playing though so be careful where you sit lol!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Well-designed, this app just does what it's supposed to, day after day after day. I started with the free one and then upgraded to support it. It's easy to use, reliable, and doesn't drain the battery or constantly try to connect to the internet like some. One of the best apps I ever bought.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My grandson and i watch this Every timeI go see him! On his own he does the dances that Shaun does at the end of each cartoon, knows the theme song by heart!
0142418471|2.0|I found this book to be extremely annoying because of the two main characters: Will Grayson and o.w.g. I honestly thought they were the most chauvinistic, rude and selfish characters I've ever read about. The ways that these two characters talked to the females in the story, were despicable. They were condescending, hypocritical and just plain rude. I did not feel bad when o.w.g found out Maura was actually Isaac. I can definitely understand why Maura would do something that extreme, because o.w.g didn't treat her like a person! He treated her like a piece of trash. o.w.g literally used Maura for coffee and passing notes and when she wanted to gain a better understanding of him, he refused to tell her his sexuality. Instead he was mean to her! There were many other ways for him to handle Maura and yet he just chose to use her and abuse her.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I have no tolerance for these two Will Graysons. Even the straight one is rude to Jane at first. He leads her on and then randomly pulls back when she tries to make a move on him. He's critical and judgmental of her hair, when he's the one with a flaming and very large gay friend!I would've hoped that the straight Will Grayson would have learned not to judge by looks through his odd friendship with Tiny. Both of these characters ruined the book for me as I just wanted them to treat the women in their lives with respect and stop whining so much. I understand they were only in high school, but generally people don't grow out of that selfishness (especially if it's as deep-rooted as theirs).<br /><br />In favor of the book though, I can admit that Tiny was a really awesome character. He was full of love and energy and was able to convince his school to put on a very gay-friendly play. He was truly an amazingly courageous character in some ways!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This story has everything from ,covers all cruelities, misfits, feelings,unknown feelings needs that are in most cases feared, because of the circumstances and  unhumanly consequenseces
1250030951|5.0|This book made me feel like I'm not alone in my obsessions. I really related to Cath and her struggles. This book is perfect for fangirls and/or those who enjoy a good coming of age story. I laughed out loud multiple times. Basically, I just loved this book.
148951418X|5.0|Using the GoPro Hero camera is unlike using any other camera. A very different photograph experience. This book nicely covers much of the intricacies of the GoPro.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really like the way I can add I input and track all my actions on any device.  As I.m thinking of something I can just add it right away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire continuos the story from the hunger games but thus book will pull you closer to the characters and there are unexpected endings at every chapter
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is highly addicting.  You wont be able to put it down once you get started. Id definitely recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games in an amazing book about a girl who has to learn how to grow up and get through different obstacles throughout her life than something major happens...
B009NY43NY|2.0|Horrible ending to a series I once loved! I am so disappointed in her lack of excitement in the last few novels.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Works great. Connected to a usb hub to use with several wireless devices. Wire has a quality feel to it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|My husband and sons love these movies, so when the chance came to pick up the box set at a great price, how could I resist?  Super-fast shipping, too.  Thanks.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|i really enjoyed the book ... interesting characters, well written and outcomes not predictable .... not a gone girl but just as interesting
B00632HWOG|5.0|Makes accessing my email so easy on my Kindle. Haven't used alot of Apps, but I do like it alot
B000I9YX06|5.0|Loved the movie, the streamed quality was good with zero breaks or drops.  I grew up with TV images and comics of The Jetsons and Lost in Space.  Comical hokie production of a fast approaching  future.  Now with robotic vacuum cleaners at our feet and our embrace of technology. Robots may soon become as common as the home microwave oven.  Interesting look at the potential peril involving human greed and evolution of. Science.  Plus. The acting is good the actress is hot.
B0013ND30M|5.0|What can I say, but my 2-year old LOVES Disney princesses, and with most of these movies hiding in the Disney vault, it was nice to find one I could still get.  She has watched this any number of times and loves to watch &#34;Rory&#34; sing and dance.  Great movie, good price, and glad to finally get a copy to share with my little girl.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works very well. Strongly recommend it. I'm now enjoying all my Netflix and Youtube stuff without having to mess around with Samsung TV's crappy built-in smart TV software.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|I love this performance by Al Pacino - Frank Serpico said Pacino played Serpico better than he did himself. Clearly Pacino got Serpico's dry sense of humor down. It is interesting to see how as the movie progresses and things get intense and dangerous for him, Serpico's sense of humor and lighthearted energy is sapped but he holds true to his principles. To this day NYC cops are pissed that Serpico rained on their parade. I am grateful that he had the integrity to do so, and that he survived to continue to be an inspiration and a voice for justice in the world.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Yes I like games like this with levels, it's challenging , can be addictive , but who cares my age, (elderly) just do what I enjoy and games is only one...
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I was so looking forward to this game I'm a major hunting game lover. but I tried to install and it said &quot; possibly &quot; not enough space. so ideleted almost every app I had plenty of space still wont install
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I love to post them on Facebook when I am done. Lots of ways to customize the &#34;paint&#34; and angles.
B003477DVK|1.0|We paid to download this to our TV. The download failed and you make it nearly impossible on your site to find out how to get a refund. So the rating is for your lack of service and commitment to customers.
0345529057|5.0|Have not openned it yet, as I cannot read them before the series is done (First time I want to be suprised and have not read the books first!!). Will cherish it.
B00F35BV64|4.0|From it's start like an Induana Jones adventure to the nicely put together plot line and scenes of action and special effects Star Trek: Into Darkness was a joyride from start to finish.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love these books quick easy read.  Easy to sit and read after work to calm down and relax. Love
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This book... I can't even. This book is the most ferocious page turner I have ever read. I read this in 7 hours flat. I could not stop. Props to Anthony Horowitz for this amazing finish.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is incredible! I read it in 12 hours straight. While it is an incredible thriller and keeps you hooked, the book is also a great commentary on relationships and marriage. I loved how the author interweaves the mystery in the plot with a very intimate look at the relationship between the two characters. The plot line unfolds in a way that makes you want to know more, and the nuanced writing about the characters and their lives gets you invested in their story. I won't say anymore to prevent spoilers.<br /><br />The book also highlights the media circus surrounding events of high-interest and has a pretty satirical and interesting take on that.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book! Read it before it is made into a movie and ruined!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is probably the most intriguing, best acted shows I've come across in a long time.  The two main characters make this show and the plot twits and supporting cast makes it all work!
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Joss Whedon is always amazing and he's done a wonderful job with one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. Great cast, great acting. It's sexy and modern.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I love the American Horror Story series, cant wait for 3 to come out on dvd, nothing but good things to say!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I just saw the previews for the second movie of this series so my husband insisted I watch the first. So glad that I did, usually with a cast of this magnitute the movies are lame. Not the case here, very funny, very good story line and I cannot wait to see the next one!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't put it down. It's addictive and I spend far too much time playing this game. The upgrades are not too easy or difficult to obtain.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|I downloaded this for our flight to Florida.  My  7 year-old thought this was awesome!!! She really enjoyed it. Great storyline interesting characters.
B00457WZEI|5.0|So interesting to read a story told from the animals viewpoint.  As a former teacher it would be interesting to read and discuss with students.  The war emphasis would certainly be excellent for discussion, especially as a Literature assignment in a history class.  Students also sometimes have difficulty accepting death in a \\"story\\".  Good for parent-child discussion!
B009WUBERW|4.0|I enjoyed watching all the old guys running around doing their thing & saving the world. Who says you're washed up after 65?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's ok if you ain't got anything else to do and need 20 coins from Amazon for downloading it, that's about it, thank you
B006WMILQU|5.0|Of the several remakes of Mansfield Park I've seen, I like this wide screen version released in 1999 best. I've watched it several times.<br /><br />Frances O'Connor, who played Fanny, was so lovely, and the movie was so well cast. The photography and locations were wonderful. Anyone who likes Jane Austin or the period in which this story is told will enjoy this picture.
159562015X|4.0|I have had many friends take this test through their HR work programs, so I decided to purchase it for myself, as I'm on the hunt for a new job. The book has a short introduction, then the rest is simply the explanations of each of the &#34;Strengths.&#34; There is a code in the back of the book which is used for the online test portion. I appreciate the examples provided for each of the strengths, as well as some suggestions for positions that would benefit from those strengths. However, once I took the test and received my results, I felt like the book just took up space. All of the information is available online, so an e-book or online purchase without wasting the paper for the book, might be more beneficial.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Fascinating read! Incarcerated women are among the most misunderstood and neglected populations in our country. Kerman does, in an an entertaining and realistic way, a great job of letting her readers in on the human beings behind walls. Her important work continues relating to prison reform, after the<br />publication of her book and the television show based on it, in bringing to light those she left behind. Most people do get out of prison. Why not have women ready to live productive lives emerging to rejoin society?
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|The acting...the directing..the plot. I have no words.<br />But apparently 12 more are required so.......it sucked. Pass this one by.
1439170916|5.0|This book was a Christmas gift last year and it arrived on time and unscathed much appreciated thank you for everything :)
B000HF0ISC|5.0|Awesome...I read the book first, but the movie followed the book to the tee.  I would watch this movie again.
0765356147|2.0|First of all, excuse me if my english is not perfect, it's not my mother language.<br /> Now, i read this trilogy because of all the good things that i had been reading about Sanderson, and how brilliant he was. So i bought the three books at the same time. Big mistake... The components of the trilogy, yet sometimes very creative, are just so superficial and poorly developed... starting with the ambience of the books, which NEVER, EVER changes, it's allways the SAME landscape, you know.. ASHES. But most important, the characters, which are SO tedious and predictable, they need more depth, they are not INTERESTING. The only one which was KIND OF interesing was the Kandra. The other charactersd, all fo them really flat, borring stuff.<br /> I have read a LOT of fantasy, and i was specting things at the level of A song of Ice and Fire and The Malazan Book of the Fallen. THOSE are great books. It was a constant reading this series, that i was allways whishing to be reading something else. I think Sanderson does not dserve all the hype, AT ALL, Steven Erikson should be receiving that attention, for example, for his masterpiece The Malazan Book of the Fallen. Sanderson's writing just lacks depth and maturity.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great app does everything it says it does. Easy to use, easy to install, I highly recommend it for Kindle Fire.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I recommend this to kids who love a loving book. It's a good book to teach kids not to judge someone by there feature but by there actions.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|A large part of the thrill of this movie is in the suspense, which can be lost if you know the movie well. I've not seen it in a few years, though, and it was just as great as I remember!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very addictive and challenging on the larger puzzle options. This app does provide  hours of entertainment. It reminds me of sudoku.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|Great show I wish I could have attended.  My kids asked who is the guy playing guitar who looks like he is about to puke?  Jimi Page, and making that face makes him play better.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Gameplay is fun and challenging. I like that it is possible to level up without using real money, but buying levelups is an option.
B00F91H15W|1.0|I understand that they're just teenagers, but it would be nice to have a bit more enticing dialogue than &#34;oh my god&#34;, &#34;wow, you look amazing in that Chanel&#34;, blah blah blah
B00CSYRHG6|4.0|I won't deal in specifics because it would undermine the story's essence as well as it's plot.<br />This is a keeper. That's only thing that comes to mind when thinking about this sleeper drama that never made it into mainstream movie houses. Disney couldn't think of a way to promote an animated film from the house that Miyazaki built because there's nothing fantastic going on, at least not in the sense that the world is being saved and exotic creatures abound in the effort. This is a nice, well structure slice of life and coming of age tale with small but potent mystery at its heart. It's also a brave film, beautifully told with ample wit, lovable characters and emotional core that really delivers in the end. At times it's a little heart breaking but it's also ideally suited to the serious drama that's underlying the premise.<br />It deals with history and assumptions that arise from that history and how it affects the survivors when the details get lost. It also addresses change and it's constant flow forward, and how to hang on when those changes prove troubling.<br />I will say this is a story about a young woman in school and boy she gradually grows fond of, and he also falls for her. As time grows and their fondness is realized the secret histories they know little about begins to affect their relationship in profound ways. The only way to resolve these issues is to dig into their families' pasts. There's nothing easy about that process.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game.I could play it all day long.Thumbs up on a great game of Mahjong!The apps like this for free make me glad I bought a Kindle!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Passed bacteria, Virus and fungi so far, I like to use the fast forward button to make it go  faster. Great game
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This novel was a book i found hard to put down. The history of the area, subplots, and characters were top quality. I loved it !
B0013FNC38|5.0|Love this CD. If you are ever in a bad mood just play this and you'll feel better! Jason is great and every song is a hit to me!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I give this book 4 stars because it touches on an important aspect of life: leaving a mark, making an impression on this earth - hopefully a positive one!<br />It also reminds the reader to live life to the fullest because there are many people out there who can't but wish they could.<br /><br />The novel is well written and I found it to be pretty funny in a cute, kiddish way. The last few chapters are mostly serious.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it got corny a few times and it is meant to pull at your heartstrings.<br /><br />Overall, it is an entertaining, thoughtful read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun cute little game its so fun i was laughing  if you like temple run and subway surfers this is way better
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a MAJOR Stephen King fan I absolutely loved this book!! It has everything you could wish for in a sequel to The Shining.  For those of you who haven't read it I will only say this: you will not regret it!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Good movie. Well written acted and directed. Could have done with out the dog part but highly recommended to watch.
B00AVXVQGI|5.0|Watch PERSUASION on a DVD first; then read the book.  The book was wonderful; even better than the movie was.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Thankful for this wonderful tool that has been provided thru Jehovah's organization. Also thankful for the friends that provided instructions on how to make it funclional for kindle fire. Hopeful that it comes to the kindle app store soon'
B00FPH6M82|3.0|I was hesitant due to the poor reviews while in the theaters, but I really enjoyed it. Worth the rental.
B00DXLO0D6|5.0|This version contains simple but effective packaging. The discs are placed in a spindle and are labeled with the season and the disc number.  My only complaint is that with 20 discs to sort through, finding the next disc to play is like shuffling through a deck of cards.  I find this a minor complaint since this is the major reason this set is so cheap.  Each season has a different label.  The video and audio quality are excellent.  The box has a list of all of the episodes for each season.  This was a great series.  Watched it growing up and also re-runs.  Glad to have this very affordable complete series on DVD.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Back to the shining but a different related story. Another lucky/poor child with a big shining and how Dan Torrance helps her cope and saves her life. It is not the Shining but a good solid read. I do love Stephen King.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is quite possibly the funniest book ever! I could not stop laughing. My husband thought I was crazy but when I read some lines to him he was laughing too! Way to go Emma Chase! Can't wait for the rest of the series.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|This is my favorite series and this first episode did not disappoint. I can't wait to see what comes from this new revelation. Definitely worth purchasing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We wanted internet TV (mainly Netflix) on a TV in our bedroom but didn't want to run wires or buy a wireless bridge just for that TV.  I stumbled on this little guy almost by accident and thought I'd give it a try...after all, it was only $35.  It's awesome!  I simply plugged it in, set it up on my existing wireless network, then I can watch netflix on this TV by initiating (and controlling) the program from my iPad, laptop, or even my iPhone.  Once the program is playing, it streams over your network, not through your device, so you can turn off your laptop or ipad and just watch the movie.
B00355L2TU|3.0|The work-out involved simple moves, but really got my heart pumping and worked the muscles.  She works with weights for 3 minutes then cardio for 2 and then abdominals for 1 minute.  I think this rotation prevents me from giving up.  Love the work-out!  Frustrated that I had difficulty getting it to play for 2 days (or download)
B00F8802SE|5.0|This show is just getting better and better by every season. I love this show. No wonder it's so popular it's just great action and acting, plus who doesn't love zombies oh I mean walkers ;)
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a story that is a real page turner. The character development was excellent.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Interesting, the book was from  a mans perspective, which is very different form a womans, and made the book a lot more interesting.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love a good TV mystery, and I love Sherlock Holmes, but since Jeremy Brett - I haven't found a Holmes portrayal I can really get into.  Being a bit of a Doyle snob, I was extremely hesitant to try this twist on the classic stories - but now I have absolutely no regrets.  This is my favorite show on TV right now, and I wait with baited breath for each episode to come out each week.
B00797MB0O|4.0|If you hate feel good movies or happy endings this is a good fit.<br />Many of the other reviews articulate the strengths of this black comedy featuring a jaded anti-hero. Mavis isn't a very sympathetic character. Mavis isn't likable. Mavis is kinda who Regina from MeanGirls might grow up to be- an emotionally stunted bitch.<br />I'm a fan of the ending. Mavis has a revelation and, she finally is honest about her life and herself. She says what the audience is thinking about her, what most of the other characters think about her, and then she hears one voice that gives her permission to continue on her life.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is very much like Diablo, only made for your kindle! Havn`t played multiplayer yet but looking forward to it.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I am less than thrilled with this mouse, it did not allow me to create a macro that contained keyboard keystrokes followed by mouse clicks.  it seems you can do one or the other but not both in the same macro.  I also noticed that at times the movement is lost in the horizontal dimension, though it may be cause the game I am running cannot keep up with the sample rate.  So far it does not compare to Razer mouse, though it was cheaper - but you only get what you pay for.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Ok, so when i try to log in it says this is taking longer than it should, try again in a bit....it's had this message for 4 days-_- now i cant get on this app and im kind of frustrated
B000T433CO|5.0|Loved it and I never watch chick flicks. We need hope in the happy endings. Kate Winslet was really cute.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like how you could upgrade the guns but I wish you could change the camo of the gun and its a great game
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I first got into BOC around 2005ish.  I dont remember why or how i got into them, but i do remember it was a darker time in my life and their music brought some clarity & peace to my mind.  In my memory, i pretty much got all the albums around the same time.  The LP's and EP's alike.  Each and everyone has a special place in my mind.  I used to go for long bike rides on a scenic, country bike trail with them in my headphones.  I'm very fond of those memories riding alone for hours & hours with complete bliss in my ipod.  BOC was so special to me at that time, and remains to this day.  But after 4-5 years, i started to wonder if they would ever release another album.  They (to my knowledge) have a very quiet presence.  I could never find new info about them online.  it was almost as if they had vanished and i assumed another album would never come.<br /><br />BUT, 2012, FINALLY.  Wow, i found some type of info saying they were doing a new album.  Man, i was so excited, yet nervous.  Music has changed a lot since the early 2000's.  Times have changed a bit.  What has become of my beloved BOC that was the soundtrack to my life for so many years?  I'd listened to the older albums 100's & 100's of times each.  Could this new piece possibly continue what was an epic, endless voice to my soul?<br /><br />After getting the CD in the mail......man.  The intro track.  It opens with this brief late 80's type VHS noise.  Reminds me of when you would stick in a movie back in the day and the sound that would play when the production companies logo would appear.  Then goes into a very dark, heavy vibe.  Very anxious, almost unpredictable.  It matched how i've felt waiting for this new album.  Builds up for 2 minutes then really launches into what we know as &#34;Tomorrow's Harvest.&#34;  &#34;Reach for the Dead&#34; brings the album up and immediately i'm nostalgic.  It reminds me of those days 8-9 years ago.  Reminds me of those times alone on the bike trail, with my mind so gone.  The sun coming down on me hot, nothing but trees and streams to my sides.

B0082RHRHC|5.0|This is one of the most sheer inspiring books I have ever read. While turning through the never ending pages, I realized that I physically couldn't stop. You will find yourself in this book unlike any other sugar-coated book it tells of true life, love, and salvation. Charlotte Brontë has captured and captivated me to the fullest extent. By reading her masterpiece, it has challenged me to live a fuller life because of the pure joy of reading it. It was a pleasure and privilege to experience saddeness, happiness, fear, bravery, longing, denying, trust, defeat, love, and hate. May God bless all who read this book as much as it has blessed me. A truer treasure never existed then that of the book Jane Eyre.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|This was the only movie in the Die Hard series that we were unable to sit through.  When we made the choice to watch this, we knew were just seeking something fun with brainless action and a weak plot but this one fell below our low expectations.  Doubt they have a refund policy on lousy movies so we will chalk this up to a bad choice on our part.  I would have given it one star, but I have never rated anything that low.....
B00FPH6M82|2.0|Graphics and Special effects were not as expected, and suprisingly bad acting from a reasonably good actor.  Other persons who also watched this movie agree that they would not recommend it to others.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|So being a Star Trek watcher from the beginning of the original series, I think we are skeptical of the &#34;new kids&#34; playing the original actor's parts.  But....the young versions of Kirk, Spock, et al did not disappoint.  Really enjoyed this movie; enough to see it again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is very addicting, and does not focus on real money.<br />It is however, more of a game to play when you are bored.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We use this for cell phone, keys, cups, bottles, snacks, pepper spray, and it works out very well.  Good size.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|George was the quiet one of the beatles but really knew how to make really good music also it is sad john and paul kept him back
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Totally unable to load on Kindle Fire. Deleted EVERYTHING on the Kindle cause it kept saying &#34;possibly&#34; not enough storage. Still will not load. Gave up!  &#34;F&#34; for this download.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|this is the beatles so all should have this music it is great and to listen to and boogie on
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|Hokey! Not very fluid on the new iPhone 1O7 operating system. Continually crashes and freezes when turning on most every time.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|john and paul really did a great work on this cd so get a copy and know you got great music the beatles
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is seriously creepy. At first it seems bland and almost uninteresting, but as the book continued I was sucked in. As this dark tale unfolded  itself in found out of my eyes, I could only watch in horrified admiration. Even though I read this book several months ago, I still get the shivers up my spine when I see it in a book store or hear it mentioned in passing. The characters are dispicable. Their plans are diabolical. No one can trust them. This book gave me a whole new outlook on everything. I can also see however, how sone people would not like this book. I f you are thinking of goinng into this because you love  good romance, this is not the book you are loooking for. This is a story of coldhearts and revenge, not forgiveness and love.
B004I4H8QI|5.0|Eric Clapton what can anyone say but it is great music to have in your collection this cd is one of his best. So from Jeff Beck,Cream and etc rock on
0783240287|3.0|I had never seen the this stage play and found it to be dated.  The music is very good and Donnie Osmond does a great job as Joseph, but I wasn't thrilled with the narrator concept.
B0090O07S2|5.0|This is the doors and I'm glad they came out with this DVD it really is great and how they were and of course Jim Morrison was a great singer
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|I have been obsessed with this album for a while now.  I can listen to it from start to finish, no problem.  My only problem now is that I am going to end up burning myself out on it.
B0025KVLUG|5.0|this was a good movie the beatles did and of course the music is great so boogie on with john paul George and ringo
B007HACDLK|5.0|Classic Flynn.great read. Bought to read on the plane, Made the long flight fly by.I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone .
B000002GBD|4.0|this band came out with one super great song and that is Love Hurts and I think it is still is
B00BK40QO0|5.0|A great success.<br /><br />Others have adequately covered Klemperer's style in Mahler, so I wanted to just write a short note on the remasterings.  All but one of the pieces benefit from new remasters that were done (according to EMI on the inside booklet) for Japan, which means they were done for the Japanese $59 reissues.  That's $59 for each symphony, and here you can get four symphonies and the best tenor ever in Das Lied von der Erde for about $25 total.<br /><br />These new remasters are not perfect because the sources are now 50 years old, but they are worthwhile for audiophiles and those wishing to hear every nuance of that great string section.<br /><br />I know there are naysayers who carp about DSD but I hope some people from my community will see the value in supporting these types of efforts by EMI to update its back catalog at such great prices.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Better than the newspaper, l  am glad I found this app, easy to read,  one click and I can check the weather in Tx, Ca and Alaska, where my kids live.
B0079J26TI|5.0|EMI is doing a great service for music lovers, these remasterings are GREAT, the music is transcendent, and the price is cheap.
0792839749|5.0|Such a great movie! It brings back so many memories! I'm so gla I get to share it with my little one now
0399159347|5.0|I loved this book because it had surprises along the way.  It kept me on my feet and kept me really interested.  Loved it!!! :-)
B00594XOZU|1.0|Won't let me login in for nothing!!!!I hate this app and will never ever use it again seems likes its always messing up.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Love the cd. As I listen to the cd I can remember the scene and what happened. Its like watching it all over again.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I tried 3-4 other podcast players before Podcast Addict and I like this one the most. Clean and simple interface yet all of the features one could hope for. I paid for the upgrade just to support the programmer - good work deserves to be rewarded.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I is a good thing for kids becuse if when you grow up you might want to be a bider I don't but I still like it IT IS FUN I BILT A  HUGE SITY BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I don't know many people who haven't seen the movie. So you probably know (in part) how this story ends without reading the book. The book is short, so it didn't have much room to dig deeper into its themes than they were able to pack into a pretty dense and intense movie adaptation. It is naturally a different experience, nonetheless, and those differences are interesting to observe. I'd recommend this short read to anyone who really grokked the movie.
B00004THAY|5.0|Love this disc. Listent to it all the time. Can't beat these two outstanding artists. Excellent tunes for my long commute to and from work.
B003O86FMW|4.0|For me, so far I like the first book.  This one was just o.k.  kept me entertained. I look forward to #3.<br /><br />Yolanda
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not much of a tv watcher but I am hooked on this series!! Love it and even my husband loves it!!
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|Dead Medium is a refreshing twist on the ghost story.  You meet May, a 75 yr old anti-social with few friends, and less family.  In life she didn't need anyone, and preferred to not to have anything to do with her neighbours and townsfolk.  When May dies suddenly she meets a few other recently departed spirits, and a dead cat.  May discovers she has the ability to communicate with the living, rather than the other way around.  Preferring to live the same way in death as she did in life she is non to happy at first to find herself reluctantly helping another recently departed spirit, trying to protect her daughter and help her cope with her mother's death.  Funny and full of one-liners.  A fun read for anyone interested in ghost stories.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|the 1st installment of the marvel thor cahracter as a movie was pretty good. I liked the idea of the nine realms and the movie jumps back and forth between them with ease, which was a refreshing change for most movies like this. The story chronicles a few battles between thor's enemies and eventually the showdown at the end of the movie against a surprise enemy. Sadly I did not care for the actor they cast as Thor. nor for the relationship that develops between the girl and thor. I thought Kenneth Branagh did a nice job directing the film and others in acted well. so 3 stars.
B004GYY714|5.0|Has amazing sound/ The ease of operation is very satisfying /Had a  glitchless download/ Would highly recommend. I installed on 3 devices!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful character development! Remember to give yourself a few pages to get into how the story is written and the plot.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots to do inside the game.. not just search and find... was a bit confusing at first but fine now
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I can't really say that this is a good book, but it is easy to read and catchy. I enjoyed my time reading it. It is particularly needed if you are planning to read the whole trilogy.
1594203334|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book. I am fasinated by other cultures. Especially those that can get their children to eat and behave. HA It is amazing how other people think. Things we take for granted are unheard of in other cultures. I thought the book was well written and very interesting.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is a great read and very well written. It brings home the closeness of a family and the lengths you will go to provide and protect them unconditionally. Purchase it you will not be disappointed.<br />Sam
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|We love this movie.  My son is 4 years old and we watch it over and over.  He is even going to be Atom for Halloween.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|The best music movie...PERIOD! An awesome doc about an iconic place that changed music as we know it...perfection at it's finest!
B00CATSONE|4.0|A little slow at first but once it picked up, it really picked up. Read eagerly about Tesla and then gave to my son to read.  May he use his imagination  better than I !!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I originally tried this on a friends tv and wifi. Since then, it won't remember my wifi and always looks for his wifi. Thus, every time i want to use it , I have to start over. This is hugely annoying and I am guessing I won't ever use it. Wishing I had just bought an Apple TV. :(
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wonderful! I loved reading this! Stephen King has done it again, keeping his readers enthralled with the story. I would recommend everyone who loves a good story to read this.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|It is a wonderful series! Very addicting! The newest series just started this week, I can not wait to see what will happen.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed this game tremendously as much for the puzzles as for the interesting story. Be sure to purchase it it a must. I can,t wait for the sequel.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Ist so awesome i love it ! Its so helpful i love it!!!!!!!!!!!! Its freaking awesome i will die for this
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Addictive and fun like most matching games.  Graphics are good to look at. nice that it was on sale though.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|great seller, i do really love this band, recommended. hope you all like this new cd as well. thank you
B00BVYJG18|5.0|Best album of the year, and their best album of the band. It rocks, and some of the screaming is tempered out.  There is new singer.
B00EP0KYDO|4.0|Well done.  Nice to see a science fiction movie with some values emphasizing more than just special effects and graphic violence/gore. A survival tale with a bonding of father and son in a tale emphasizing courage, endurance and the valor of a child. The only thing really missing for me is the modern movie aversion to mentioning \\"faith' and spiritual values. Heaven forbid using the word \\"God\\". It's as if script writers have tried to marginalize their significance. Throughout history (and even today)faith in God or a Supreme Being has often led to many acts of bravery. The overemphasis on science and technology, in this movie places the responsibility for the elimination of fear(in this case the 'pheromones\\" produced by fear) solely on man's ego and reason. A reading of history shows that man's use and sole reliance on reason has often led to some pretty absurd and disturbing things (e.g. the world is flat, the sun revolves around the world, etc. etc. etc.). No more pontificating from me. Enjoy the movie.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great performances in BBC style ... brooding mystery with proper suspicion and compassion.  Yikes!  Start this and you'll be up until 2:00 am with &#34;just one more chapter.&#34;
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I love playing this game it's fun and you get a lot of prizes but in the puzzles it's not giving the dozer dollars after completing them I completed 3 and not got any that it says is the reward other than that it's fun just wish I could get dollars to upgrade the prize section
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This little thing is the only charger that has managed to actually charge a phone when the GPS is being used. The battery had more charge than when I started. Paired with with a Mediabridge USB Charging Cable - (6 Feet) - USB-A Male to Micro-B Charging Cable (ASIN: B009W34X1I), it manages to charge an android phone in the AC mode. Very impressed. Feel really bad when I think of all the money wasted trying all the other car chargers I bought over the years!. It also worked well with the IPad. Does get a bit warm after a couple of hours of serious use, but nothing compared to some others. If you need a viable solution to actually charge you device, not just maintain some charge. I mean charge with some serious use like GPS and bluetooth turned on. Look at this with the cable mentioned above. I have not tried this charger with any other regular cable yet, plan to do that on the next long drive.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again. It is put together masterfully. Whoever thought you could do Halloween and Christmas in the same picture.
1843793792|5.0|Venetia is the beautiful and witty daughter of a wealthy but eccentric man. She has never left her home in the country, but instead has run the household for her father and after his death, her brothers. She has admirers, but her heart remains untouched until a new gentleman arrives in the neighborhood.  Georgette Heyer is the queen of the period romance. Richard Armitage is a fabulous reader. Highly recommended.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in our Stars, written by John Green is a young adult book about teens with cancer. Generally, books about cancer aren't very appealing. But when you get this book about two teens who find love in midst of their treatments, you just can't put it down. When Hazel Grace Lancaster meets Augustus Waters at her cancer support group her life changes in ways she didn't think possible. Between supporting their best friend Isaac and planning trips to meet a famous author, the two develop a relationship that no one else could ever understand.<br /><br />What I really liked about this book is the fact that John Green uses big words and talks about things that most people think teens won't understand. Generally, people my age are completely clueless about the stages and different types of cancer, but that doesn't stop John Green from putting all those words that go along with treatment into his writing. I like this book because I couldn't put it down. It pulls you in with the use of humor and tragedy all at the same time. I couldn't stop reading because it was so wonderful, yet at the same time, all you wanted to do was cry.<br /><br />There wasn't anything I didn't like about this book. I think some people didn't like how John Green had the characters use such big words and say these long speeches that normal teens would never say. What people don't realize is that Hazel and Gus aren't `normal.' They were forced to grow up way before anyone else their age. They've been living life with the mentality of expecting death almost their whole lives so I don't think that John Green making them give each other these speeches was a bad thing.<br /><br />I've read all of John Greens' books except An Abundance of Kathrines. In my opinion, The Fault in Our Stars is the best one he's written. I would say that anyone could read this book. It teaches you a lot about life and yourself.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Ann Leckie has written a marvelous book filled with excellent characters, vivid world-building, and a remarkable plotline. Some readers have compares this book to Dune and I don't think the comparison is inaccurate. I believe with this launch, Ann will go on to write n excellent space opera series that will be rem for decades.<br /><br />5/5 stars. Bravo to the author!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful story, sometimes it does not feel like a teenage novel at all. I totally recommend it for all ages.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The first movie blew my mind and even though this movie did fall short from being spectacular, I still enjoyed it very much. The effects and the story where all well done. Keep in mind that I have not viewed the original series of Star Trek movies so I can only speak of this as a current fan and not a long time fan. The bonus content offered in the Blu Ray gives some decent insight on what went down behind the camera or final footage. Highly recommend this to any SyFy fan.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|You know it's one in a million when you enjoy a book every time you read it, especially if you're still rereading it over a period of forty-plus years. Like wine, it improves with time.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun to play.  However it's too difficult to obtain pearls to advance the reef building .  Great educational reef, but it has more potential for it being a GREAT teaching tool.  Basically, I enjoy it.
B0083V2VW8|5.0|It's The Who! What else needs to be said? But because Amazon needs 17 words or more, I'll continue. Fantastic movie with plenty of insight into the good ole days of Mod's & Rockers!
B003LPV960|5.0|The cast does a wonderful job in this fun family movie. The sets and costumes were just a delight to soak in. The story is fun and charming. I saw the second Nanny McPhee too and thought it paled in comparison to this original one!
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|Better as it has more ACTION, brings Roman into the real world giving him more character. Shaman is the essence of his soul.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Movie was great. Only thing I was disappointed in was I bought it on my Nook Color and it would not play. Said it was not compatable with the device. So be careful what device you order for.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is a great variety of games in this app.  I love being able to add games as you make progress.  This helps keep me from getting bored with the app
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I have been a Derek Trucks fan since seeing him play as a guest with the Allman Brothers in 1994.  He is one of the great musicians working today and I have enjoyed his solo work for years.  I do miss hearing Mike Mattison singing, he has a really unique sound, but Susan Tedeschi has an unbelievable voice too.  This album has a fairly consistent sound and I have enjoyed listening to it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik used to work great on my kindle. Now when  I try to get on it will load and say error this is taking to long. It won't log in or make a new one . ._. It's really bad. Even if you delete it  won't work.  Please fix!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I  do not  know  why  they  did not  do  more  seasons  on  Spartacus. One  of  the  best  shows  ever on  tv!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movies is great, and I love the condition it is in, and would recommend it to friends, family and co-workers
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|I love anything vintage, but XnRetro Pro has really made my modern day photos look really old fashioned, but also great at the same time!  I had seen many apps that promise to make pictures and photos look vintage, but this app really does what it says it does!
B001F12J48|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies with Tom Hanks, the graphics are awesome, and the DVD's are in great condition, thank you.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is very unique and different from all other mahjong games that I played.  Why is Mahjong Artifacts unique and different?  It is unique and different because I can play the game in different modes, and it keeps me on my toes!
B00E0SXNE8|4.0|This is a great movie for adults and kids to watch together.  Moral of the story lessons can be learned from young and old and that family bonds are important.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The headset is great but it always has the constant lost of the connection. It always drops and then comes back. Sometimes it just cuts off for no reason and never comes back. It has it's minor problems but it's easily good to get around with a simple on/off.<br /><br />So the charge doesn't work (USB) funny thing is, Is that when I plug in my phone it charges but when I plug in my headset it refuses to charge it, But when I charge my headset (logitech G930) on my phone charger it seems to work fine. I don't know what's wrong with this headset but it has it's problems.<br /><br />Overall: Sound is great but the random lost of connection happens and it refuses to charge via dock. (Only charges when I charge it via phone charger)
B00DW1WR14|2.0|Well another 4 year wait for a Pearl Jam album and yet another disappointment.<br /><br />There is some okay tracks on this album but overall its the same old stuff they have been churning out since Riot Act.<br /><br />Mind your manners, Fathers Son and Getaway may remind you of songs from Yield and Vitalogy but they still don't improve the album much, you have heard it all before.<br /><br />Sirens is another ballad much like Parachutes or Just Breathe which are probably the two worst styles of Pearl Jam songs around.<br /><br />To be honest, this is a disappointment. If they can release an album in 2014 thats as good as Versus or Vitalogy with a bit of experimentation (for a change) I might just forgive them.<br /><br />Out of 10, I'd give it a 6.rown together.<br /><br />The other problem is, its not really an improvement over anything they have done before, its more aggressive than Backspacer and the songwriting is better than on the 2006 album, but I would not say its better than on Riot Act.<br /><br />Who knows, even though the band aren't as young as they once were obviously, they can still release a decent record next time and maybe try and experiment a bit and push things forward.<br /><br />By all means buy it, but don't expect anything new. I am not ready to give up on Pearl Jam, yes they are'nt as young as they once were, but I don't think thats the problem, I think the problem is they are just comfortable not breaking their musical boundaries much.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Such a good series.  Captivating.  Leaves you on the edge of your seat! I'd recommend this to anyone who has some time on their hands to play catch up.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I've had this app for months and it was working fine. Then out of no where it won't allow me to type any messages. For So I deleted it. Then I downloaded it again. Now it will not allow me to log back in again. For two weeks I've been having problems with this app. I need help please!!!
B0042RJWTC|3.0|I love the Tudors series but was disappointed with some of the DVD's. Some will just stop in the middle of the show. Freeze up and then I have to skip most of that scene.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These things are awesome. now i can take a dump and listen to my computer at the same time!! you wont be disappointed<br />no problems!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game!  I don't quite understand all  the details but it's lots of fun!  Though you may want to &quot; buy&quot; extra energy ( by using crystals you already have - seldom need to spend extra money), it's nice to have a set time limit so you're not up all night playing!
140006922X|5.0|I chose this rating because this book is one of the most honest portrayals of the historical Jesus on the market. It seriously considers the Roman occupation of Judea and Jesus rebellion against Rome as a key component to understanding the historical Jesus. With this in mind Jesus must have been executed because he claimed to be (or his followers claimed he was) King of the Jews. The author points out that Jesus was one of many zealots who claimed to be Messiah (i.e. King). For the Romans there was only one King, Caesar. This book is a must read for anyone with the slightest interest in the historical Jesus.
076115678X|4.0|A great book giving helpful advice on how to control unruly, out of control, natural curly hair. Product and hair styling advice for embracing natural curl instead of fighting it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very detailed plot and graphics.  After some time this got pretty old though.  Still, for my Kindle Fire this was the first I bought to use and found it without kinks or glitches.  Enjoyable.  If I had experienced more games I might have rated this 4 star - but for the first one I had bought - I had three nights of fun.  Bring on MYST for Kindle Fire now.
B007NZQUUE|3.0|I read this as a teenager. It blew me away. I knew it was hookum but it was fun. Returning to this 20 years later, the hookum is still there, but it's so dated and so obviously fabricated that it gets boring. The authors do have a wonderful bit where an effete literary critic gets hold of the book (the story is self-aware) and rubbishes it. It's this sort of loony humor that salvages the book. Thank goodness we're not living in the 70s anymore.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I would recommend this fine film to any history buff. It not only shows the star in her role, but the story of WW2.
0670014893|5.0|It was a gift. A book my husband wanted.  Le Carre is his favorite &#34;spy&#34; author. Book was well received and was on his birthday list
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Love this show... the characters are amazing and well developed. The main characters are like the perfect brotherly duo.  I absolutely love to hate Luis and Donna is an absolute necessity to the show. The script is to die for and the plot just twists and turns perfectly!  So glad I watched it on Amazon and not on TV. I would not have been able to wait a week between shows!
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|You can only fight once and then you have to wait for a half in hour before you can fight again DON'T BUY THIS GAME
B005JABSB6|5.0|Great product and great price. Very fast shipping. I was so excited to get this and the fact that it got to me before the estimated delivery date was an added plus. The price was a steal as well.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|apparently I have to much apps when I deleted all of them please fix this because it sounds very fun
B001CDWFPC|5.0|good seller and purchase
B000A2XC1C|5.0|The movie came pretty quick and in all its packaging.  It was a gift for a friend so I never opened it and viewed it but assume there were no issues with the disc itself being that it was wrapped up and in good shape when it arrived.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|The CD is wonderful  especial &#34;wild is the wind&#34;, just an incredible rendition ! Definitely looking forward to<br />purchasing another CD
B00594XOZU|1.0|When I Try to LOG on it tells me to wait a bit when I go back it still Dosent Work
8866130885|1.0|Granted I was only half paying attention when I ordered; however giving it is 10/15/2013, Amazon should make it clearer that you are ordering a 2013 (emphasis added) calendar!! They shouldn't even sell this stuff unless at almost a complete discount.  Luckily I figured out my mistake with enough time to cancel.<br /><br />That said, I do own this calendar and LOVE it!  However it is USELESS (obviously) for next year.
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|I am addicted to the Avengers. This is very good production wise for a TV show. I am alittle disappointed that its a show for teenagers but such is the market.
B002M9WW30|5.0|It's a neat collection of all the Rocky movies, but make sure you have the right region on your dvd player. It only works in USA and Canada!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|To find endings for such a disparate number of story lines is a true feat of writing. Well done. Well written.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Exceptionally well written and awfully similar to my freshman year in the dorms in Santa Barbara. Only ours was coed. Otherwise, pretty close.
B00DUHT3OO|3.0|I enjoyed this classic but found it repetitive and rather long and drawn out.  Of course, I do appreciate the time it was written and as well as Jane Austin's talent  knowing she was quite young when she started writing.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I bought this when it was on the daily deals for a great price.  I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise because I don't think it's worth $70.  All the movies are classic and great, but not really many bonus features.  Of course, you have to take into account that all but one of the movies was made before the year 2000, so bonus features really weren't the norm.  I would suggest buying this at a reduced price, don't pay full and you won't be dissapointed.
B005HEXQN2|1.0|I'm a sucker for a good time travel episode, and this is one. Who wouldn't want to go back and do things differently. As we get older, we all ponder \\"what if?\\" However, consider this: in \\"City on the Edge of Forever,\\" \\"The Voyage Home,\\" and \\"First Contact,\\" history must be corrected to save the planet.<br /><br />In \\"Endgame,\\" Janeway alters destiny because she didn't like that it took her 23 years to get home and tragedies befell some crew members whom she regarded as family. Captain Kirk let the woman he loved die to prevent Hitler from winning WW2!<br /><br />Purists please correct me if I'm wrong, but there should have been some discussion/discovery about how the timeline was altered for the worse and old Janeway's actions were necessary to restore balance. Otherwise, it's one bitter and cranky old lady's desire to change history because she didn't like what happened. Given the Theory of Unintended Consequences, she could have set into motion a series of events that could have proven disastrous for the Federation. At the very least, she altered the destinies of trillions of lives across the United Federation of Planets, some perhaps for the better, others probably for the worse. Not the actions of a responsible Starfleet officer.<br /><br />Of course, as Shatner would say, \\"Get a life! It's just a TV show!\\"
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found it challenging and entertaining which was excellent... but I think it could use more levels before your asked to rate it I felt that it popped up quiet quickly compared to other app games it was a little slow
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|It is a good Saturday day movie. It is not hard to see a world like the one in this movie.<br />Visions of George Orwell 1984. Just mindless fun.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|From original air date to streaming in less than 24hs, with no commercials, for less than $2 an episode? Where do I sign up?! What, I'm already signed up just by being an Amazon customer? All I have to do is click a button? SWEET!!<br /><br />Yeah! this beats the heck out of $100 a month for cable when I don't watch 99.9% of it. Buying by the show is the way to go! I have maybe 3 shows I keep up with now that Breaking Bad is over. I will save $100's a year! Thank you Amazon!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good story but book jumps around with each chapter and the different characters. Can get confusing with all the characters.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|entertaining. challenging. some levels are hard to get three stars. but it is fun to try to get more stars.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Doesn't suck outright.  Doesn't rate 5 stars either.  The movie was &#34;meh&#34;.  The video arrived quickly and as described period.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|it works but not great. I have a EA3500 Linksys router which I believe is just find because it works with my other devices in the house, ie, tablet, smart TV, Xbox. It buffers a lot and that is frustrating. I took everything off the network thinking it needed more bandwidth...NOT! maybe there is something I'm missing, but not sure. If anyone can help me, it would be great!
B003D513TQ|5.0|This movie was SO good! It was clean (no language or inappropriate scenes), and the plot and characters were excellent! It is definitely worth watching! :)
0765338149|3.0|It was An Interesting Story And Had A Great Twist At The End. But It Wasn't A Real Page Turner.
0525953728|5.0|great book must read for anyone interested in Seal Team Six and other special operations groups you will love it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|No more listening to a buzzing to wake up.  No more counting on the cell phone to be loud enough to wake you up.  This is a great app, wealth worth the little that was paid.  I use it every day!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Twisted & yet unable to put it down.  Great read with numerous surprises. Loved it & the author.  Must read.
B002QUWYWE|4.0|This is a classic movie. It's not the most sparkly and entertaining by today's standards, but it's suspenseful and fun. A little gross but still a good movie from a Stephen King book.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Very exciting and hope there will be a season two.  They left us hanging at the end of season one!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you saw What the Bleep Do We Know? and were intrigued but unable to process the message, you will love this book. It is broken down in a way that you can understand how to bring about a powerful force in your life. I'm excited to practice tapping into the FP and changing my life :)
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Studio Ghibli always produces good films. Personally I enjoy the fantasy films the studio makes a bit more than the real-life based ones, but this was a wonderful and heartfelt movie. A movie to watch if you want to feel warm and fuzzy when its over.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This movie was done tastefully and shows how our society's actions affect children.  Tragic events change the world.  Great movie.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 8 year old son loves it! Keeps him busy when I have to take him with me otherwise he would be bored, love Angry Birds!
B000EUDAWG|5.0|It is all she wanted and is her favorite toy.We just couldn't believe she wanted an rc spider for her birthday
0375869026|5.0|I read this book with my 10 year old daughter for &#34;book club&#34; through her school and I would highly recommend this book to both adults and children. The theme of kindness runs throughout this book and it holds valuable lessons on friendship, family and being different.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I have been using this app for years now and it only gets better as you go. So many options and sounds. Almost too many to choose from!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I've watched the Good Wife  on my Kindle Fire (with prime you get the first four seasons free!).  The title of this show is a bit misleading because it's about a family split apart by a philandering husband who is now in a high position in government and running for governor while trying to keep the facade of his marriage as if all was well though the public is well aware he has had several 'sessions' with prostitutes. The wife is slowly letting him back in her good graces but first has an affair of her own which her husband suspects. The show really spends more time in the courtroom and the offices where the wife has, after 15 years away, restarted her career. The husband played by Chris Noth (of Sex and the City) and Julianna Marquiles (of ER fame) plays his wife but we see more of her as a competent and extremely talented lawyer who could seemingly do well on her own. I have to say I like the Good Wife more than Scandal. The twists and turns the show is taking are just as show-stopping as in Scandal and for no particular reason or reasons I can't express this show has become one of my favorites.<br />Alan Cummings, Stockard Chaning, Christine Baranski (Cybil) are the most well known of the cast  do a damn good job. Nathan Lane gives a amazing performance as well as many other guest stars you would recognize from other shows.<br />If you have not seen The Good Wife do give it a gander....If you are a prime member check out the first four seasons on your tablet or Fire or any Amazon product that will stream to see if you love it and you can go from there. I had a marathon and I hated when the battery ran down so when it was charged I was right back.<br />I can't forget the unbelievably good performance(s) by Michael J. Fox. He plays an opposing lawyer and is magnificent in several of the shows.<br />The Good Wife--A winner and  fantastically good show.<br />Check it out!!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|It doesn't work on my kindle. But on my ipad it works and also said it needs to be updated. maybe that's the problem on the kindle
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this series.  You become very involved with each character .  I look forward to watching 2 to 3 episodes at one time .
B00FEX2ZFG|2.0|it was meh,  did not find it scary.  very predictable and for the most stupid.  i could have fell asleep
0061950726|5.0|The notion of orphaned children always pulls on the heartstrings. No matter where, their pain and loss are palpable, exacerbated all too often by the instability and insecurity that follow the death of their parents.<br /><br />What makes Orphan Train stand out is the story of Vivian, a 90-year-old woman who was orphaned over eight decades earlier. With all the criticism we can level today at the insufficiency of child protective services to address the needs of orphaned children--seen through the eyes of Molly, a teenager whose father's death and her mother's descend into insanity render her orphan--it pales when compared with what took place in the early- to mid- 20th century.<br /><br />Vivian and dozens of orphaned children were collected from the streets and tenements of New York City, put on trains (where girls like the 9-year old Vivian were in charge of infants for the many days of riding.) When reaching a Midwest station, townspeople came over to select children--often to employ them in household and farm duties. No background check, no guidelines were placed. Vivian was thrown into abhorrent situations of child labor until, luckily, as a mature teenager she met a good couple that offered her safety.<br /><br />The story weaves between Molly and Vivian and their growing fondness and bond. The ending is predictable yet cathartic. There is no drama except the strength inherent in the emotional pull, the excellent research, and the wonderful, polished prose. And perhaps that too, contributes to the power of the novel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this book down! It was very well written and kept me on the edge of my seat through out the entire book! Can't wait to read more from this author!!
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|The voice over is torture. Please redo the audio with a pro narrator.............please.<br />It's not easy getting passed the narration. It sucks the life out of this film.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Really enjoyed this! We watched this on our at home Friday Movie Night! Awesome movie and I cannot wait to see two and three!!!
B00BLDD3A4|3.0|..whole album, buy the song &#34;From Can to Can't&#34; It's totally worth it and hands down the best song on the whole thing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I initially downloaded this game for a kids that I babysit but I have not been able to put it down!  It is fun being able to compete against friends, definitely makes time fly when bored!
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Love this CD and have shared it with all 4 of my grankids. Several songs we enjoy as sing-a-longs! Catchy songs that span the popular genre that use popular kids poetry as lyrics. I have to confess that I listened to this CD in the car even without having my grandkids with me. Natalie Merchant is a very talented musician and this is a wonderful example of her broad range.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this app!! Hope they keep upgrading with more fun all the time and better costumes to dress up in.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|One of my all time favorites. michael keaton is spectacular. the set design, music, and chatacters create a creepy and amusing atmosphere.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Very fun!!!!! This has taken up a huge chunk of my free time but for the better! There are like 15 new birds/pigs to play with! Really changes the gameplay.
