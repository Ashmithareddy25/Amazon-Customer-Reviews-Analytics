B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was an easy ready that I couldn't put down!! I love how the book was told from the perspective of someone who was mentally in a bad place from a nervous breakdown and was able to break free and live again....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|extremely fun, challenging puzzle game. enjoy the multiple levels and the variance within the levels. I would highly recommend this app.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app!!!! During my lunch break, I turn it on in the background (the ocean is my favorite), read from my kindle and I feel like I'm on the beach reading. It really helps me tune out all the other distractions. I use a lot of the other sounds as well but this is my favorite!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun as a time-consumer. It starts off fast moving and fun and slows down if you do not purchase game credits. Like I said it's a good time-waster.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the book was uniquely written. The plot was amazingly well thought out. However I give it four stars because the book distorts and demeans marriage.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|love it. challenging but fun. entertaining and works your mind and reflexes at the same time. FUN. fun. fun fun
1846551455|5.0|i was really happy to get this book as I own and have read all of his other books. Good story and gives you a look at the early Harry 'Holy'.As always there are suprises along the way. I would recommend this book. Can't wait till his next book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|there should be a mini-game it where you get to be the police chasing the kid and there should be like if you were the kid you use a hover board but the guy should ride on the dog if she or he taps twice.
1935597760|2.0|The fact that it made me cry and kept me entertained is something. It also has an original and surprising ending. However it is not a book I would recommend. I am not keeping it in my library for my son to read when he grows up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun,  it is definitely good for a young child :) it has a very good interface and lot of options for customizing the gameplay.
B0010T75W6|5.0|hedwig is a personal favorite- it has an amazing soundtrack and an interesting bold story. it is however, not for everyone
B000W91RUG|1.0|This TV series is extremely offensive and completely insulting to anyone in a scientific discipline.  The characters portrayed in the series are not at all like scientists in the real world.  They are Hollywood's misconception of reality.  And, as usual, Hollywood has gotten it wrong--again!  This outrageous, garbage-laden series should be banned from the airwaves.
1455121924|5.0|The book helps to guide you into why people should go wheat free and what todays wheat really is.  The book really helped me understand what is happening to my body.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great read.  It's not depressing as others have said, but uplifting and real.  I would recommend this book for everyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great read with twists along the way.  I like that the story starts quickly and builds upon that, I was hooked from the first page and could hardly put it down.  I despise the ending though!
B00007ELEL|5.0|No matter how many times you watch this movie, you will find something new to laugh about EVERY time. The Cohen brothers have made another fantastic movie with The Big Lebowski.
B009RH973I|5.0|While I wish I could find a case that is more attractive, this one is functional and does everything I need it to.  Seems like it will last a long time as well.

B008Y212PI|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. Housework isn't getting done, other hobbies are being ignored. I am glad I don't gamble!!! I would be broke.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|Some may hate on this flick, but as someone who is a fan of the Alien movies (sans Predator related crossovers), I'm a big fan of this flick.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I can only hope that Lizbeth and the boys can reconjur this kind of magic again, but a sample of their follow-up was dissapointing. However this one, their self titled debut, stands very well on it's own.<br />The lyrics smack of Pat Benetar, even if the voice lacks the power or the range. The attitude reminds me much more of early Joan Jett, but the voice is sweeter and more controlled. Crunch guitars and more hooks than a tackle box make it worth the spin in either case.<br />Guitar-rock is Boys Town, so it's rare to find this kind of talent and determination without a Y chromosone in the soup. What a great change of pace!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is the best mystery game you could buy. please get it I liked it very much. so would you.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|The multi layered vocals make this cd. But the guitar driven powerchords and catchy hooks are the muscles and the bones.<br />Can these Floridians follow their own act?
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|Authentic of the original but the controls stink rendering this game not fun. This review has nothing to do with any issue surrounding in game purchases.  Fact of the matter is game play is seriously impaired by the controlls.
0767903862|5.0|I originally bought this as part of a course curriculum, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Funny, informative, and intriguing, I will reread it in the future and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes travelling, Australia, and humor.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Marvellous series enjoyed every moment of it.  But I don't like the ending where Julian Fellowes has killed off Matthew.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|This movie is even better in Blu-Ray!  Full of adventure and well worth the money.  5 more words required - are you serious?
B008602KQI|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence is just a good actress.  Quite athletic too.  Good show. The concept is a bit strange, but, with the country like it is, maybe not.
0684857219|5.0|If you love lifting, you should own this book. Or at least have a buddy that'll let you borrow it.<br /><br />Ya, Arnold took a lot of roids, and so did everyone in this book. If you are still naive enough to believe that any professional athlete, let alone a strength competitor, is completely clean, then start doing some basic research. And you won't be able to get through an advanced workout unless you're eating  a TON of food and are highly adapted (probably 4+ years of intense weightlifting).<br /><br />This book is what it is: an encyclopedia of awesome. Comprehensive list of exercises, lots of advice for beginners and advanced trainees (although I don't agree with Arnold's use of BBing techniques for novice weightlifters) and tons of awesome pictures. If this doesn't make you wanna hit the gym, nothing else will.
0670026603|2.0|**SPOLIERS**  Just read the inside front cover summary of the book, and you know exactly what is going to happen. I can not believe people say this is the best book they have ever read. It kept my interest somewhat because I have worked with quadriplegics in the past. I was also mildly interested in learning about the British unemployment and education systems. Otherwise, this book was way too long and completely predictable.<br />The characters were horribly stereotypical. All of the wealthy characters were cold, stand-offish, and self-absorbed, including Louisa's boyfriend (not wealthy but somewhat successful). Even Louisa's sister, who was the most successful of the family, was selfish. But all of the poorer characters were kind-hearted and caring. God forbid someone would write a book about nice rich people, or mean poor people.<br />It was also completely unbelievable that with the education and wealth of the Traynor family, nobody ever though of getting Will a voice controlled keyboard or any other assistive devices. Nobody looked into accessible activities or travel for him. It took clueless Louisa to come along to think of that. Really??<br />The most bothersome part of the book is that it told the same old story of rich good-looking man comes along to save the poor, dumb girl. Isn't it time to think of a new story line?<br />I might give the book 2 1/2 stars but wouldn't necessarily recommend it to any of my friends.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Every single song and its performer is excellent. I came across this video album when watching a music show on PBS channel.<br />The seller is also excellent. The first disc I received was defective. I requested for an exchange and received a new one within 2 days, even before the seller received my returned disk. EXCELLENT customer service.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I first read the book and then saw the movie.  The book was so much better as it developed all the characters to their full potential. It's an easy read.  I would highly recommend it!
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I always wanted a product like this to find and store photos. I feel this will do it... thought must have patience.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors. The Innocent has a great plot, believable characters you get to know well. Too bad it ended.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|this is a great, classic, casual, timekeeper. be aware that if you don't wear it for a couple of days you'll need to reset the time. it's a small price to pay (in more ways than one) for not having to worry about batteries. switching out the band to a single strap gives a lot of room for style.
B00BF123WG|4.0|CIA collaborates with Hollywood to give as good a dramatization as possible and still be entertaining. Well done!! But it still needs more explosions.
B003FCMAS0|5.0|Pretty cool look at Dr. parnassus. I'm dying to see the film again, but this was free, so figured I would take a look. It was worth it. :)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|An epic piece of filmmaking that gets nearly everything right.  Memorable, insightful, and not overdramatic.  It won its Oscar for good reason.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Had a completely different feel than the last two books did for me. I enjoyed it, but after reading all three I still find the first book the most enjoyable.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|The real treat in this musical is the appearance of Louis Armstrong. The music is uplifting and fun. The dance numbers are energetic and energizing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved the first one, I liked this one it just seemed kind of reductive. Overall though, I got through it without too many complaints.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|This is a classic for a reason. The theme is universal and ageless. Who can resist good against evil in a war time setting?
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|When i first got a Facebook i had this game diamond dash and i think that it works great for the kindle fire HD and this game is really addicting but the only flaw is that you have to have a lot of gold to get more time :P but other than that its great
B002M87W9K|5.0|The music will make your feet tap. Robert Preston is excellent and the perfect foil to the straight laced librarian. The story gives us a glimpse into life in the early 1900's. A truly enjoyable experience.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|It's really great but VERY hard to unlock the rescue levels...I wish it would let me...other than that I think it was very fun and exciting - I also wish you could play in multiplayer online instead of having to play with someone who was with you...but anyway besides that it was great
B001ANSSDC|5.0|With all the movie buzz, this story felt known to me when I started. I was wrong. There was so much that was new. This story was heartbreaking and beautiful and honest. The need for us to understand mental health is clear. Making Pat the story's hero is a step in the right direction. I won't ruin the book with spoilers but I will say it will have you looking at clouds again.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Good App. I like the U.I. It looks like the YouTube app with a simple overlay of a few buttons. Just enough to get the job done

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've seen the videos before and they simply blow my mind.  I love the mix of classical and contemporary.  Very well done and well worth the price.<br /><br />I would have liked the vocal version of Titanium/Pavane on there, but it is still extremely strong without the vocals.  Peponi is one of my favourite songs on there, even though I'm not a Coldplay song.<br /><br />A good mix of fast and slow songs.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is a well -documented story of immense interest! I loved the music, but especially the narrative of  an unsung American treasure.
0446573027|5.0|Zero Day and its characters were so great I have ordered The Forgotten;  Just simply enjoy Baldacci's readings....<br />Definitely 'no diaappointment' here.
B00AH8U3UC|4.0|Ya gotta luv this cast and their silly shenanigans. I love the hollywoodness of this series (Lived in LA for a while, and while I wasn't part of that crowd, I rubbed shoulders enough to appreciate the quirky accuracy at some level of the personalities and events.) Don't look for politically correct, but for a very &#34;American&#34; view of individual freedom to be as screwed up as you want to be and glory in it. Maybe part of why I love it is how they go on loving each other despite their moment-of-weakness betrayals of each other. And that sex is acknowledged as a forceful driver, not necessarily as romance, but as an interesting leisure activity.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie more than my kids.  They liked it for the cartoon aspect but much of the tongue in cheek verbal humor was over their heads (ages 6 and 8).  I liked the humor and the memories of those video games of my youth (which they know nothing about.  But again, they still liked it.  The first 15-20 minutes was kinda slow but it took off after Ralph got to Suger Rush and meets the little glitch.  It also had an underlying moral message about being happy with who you are and that the person you are is intregal to something bigger.  Good movie.

1604441224|5.0|There are two things that strike me as unique about `The Hound of the Baskervilles' at least when compared to the stories in `The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.' One is that the change of setting to the fog-drenched moors casts a different light on the proceedings. The other is that in this story there is a lengthy portion in which Watson is the primary on stage participant and detective. Holmes returns earlier than we realize initially but even taking that re-entry into account, he is absent throughout much of the action at the core of the story.<br /><br />This absence thrusts Watson onto center stage and his deductive powers are pushed to their limits. He does an admirable job of pursuing leads and has learned his lessons from Holmes well. However, the burden is wearing upon his resolve and he has reached a point of despair when Holmes reappears. Watson is always a central character in that we are given his words, his interpretations and his perceptions of every Holmes adventure. In this novel, we even glimpse his diary and his determination to put Holmes' methods into practice.<br /><br />Even those who know very little about Holmes know the title `The Hound of the Baskervilles,' even if they know very few details of the plot. As a novel, it is uniquely positioned to grab the attention of those readers who may want something more super-sized than a short story to undertake in order to sample a Holmes story.<br /><br />The change of locale allows Doyle to create a different kind of mystery. The family legend/curse is reminiscent of gothic horror stories and one would not be at all surprised to see the ghosts of Heathcliff and Cathy roaming these moors. Holmes' and Watson's detection methods are still employed as they are in the crowded urban London stories yet here on the moors there are fewer places to hide from a demonic hound, escaped convict or a psychopathic entomologist. Holmes is still a practical man who believes only in reason and discounts the supernatural but the setting on the moors, more so than any of the actors that tread upon it, is supernatural. The damp and oppressive fog can leach the soul and the quicksand bogs can lure anyone to muddy death.<br /><br />In this instance, Holmes solves the mystery with the aid of Watson's own deductive conclusions. Without them he could not assemble all the pieces of the puzzle and reach the correct conclusions. Watson should therefore be credited with solving the mystery as much as Holmes. However, Holmes is still the master strategist, directly or indirectly moving his players on the board like chess pieces. Holmes credits the villain with being the most ingenious and diabolical foe they've come across. This puzzled me. The villain is indeed clever. However, there are instances where he overplays his hand and leaves behind witnesses that have sufficient grounds for despising him and that would not hesitate to testify against him. I don't see how he outwits Holmes or even Watson. In fact, the `foe' that almost prevents Holmes from saving a potential victim is the encroaching fog which encompasses the moor at the most inopportune time. Holmes and Watson barely miss saving this person from a grisly death.<br /><br />Despite what I see as an overestimation of his foe by Holmes, the mystery appears to be airtight, although I'm sure that if one dismantled each piece of evidence and scrutinized it one could find oversights or conclusions that stretch beyond logic. That criticism could be lodged against almost any mystery and is beside the point of mystery novels. The master mystery writer like Doyle is like a magician, distracting the reader by focusing his attention on one piece of evidence while maneuvering another piece of evidence that is usually hiding in plain sight. I am not surprised by the popularity of `The Hound of the Baskervilles.' It is an ingenious, cleverly planned and plotted mystery which contains thrilling action forcing Holmes and Watson to conduct much oftheir investigation in the middle of an oppressive and treacherous environment. Holmes lacks the luxury of theorizing overnight in his cozy Baker Street apartment. He is in the middle of a harsh, unforgiving locale in which a split second delay could result in someone's untimely death. It is a masterful blend of mystery, adventure and gothic mood piecetheir investigation in the middle of an oppressive and treacherous environment.

0857685848|5.0|One of the best collections of fine paleoart I have found. Every page is filled with gorgeous illustrations of prehistoric animals, this book will be one you return to time and time again, and makes for an awesome coffee table book to show off.
B00068NVI4|5.0|There are few tracks where Chris Squire uses a bass pedal - if you have a decent sound system your subwoofer is going to try to do subsonic things. Utterly amazing. Sound track was very well recorded as was the filming (location = Boston). Jon Anderson's vocals are sharp and Rick Wakeman shines on the keyboards. You won't be disappointed!
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|Incredible and mesmerizing!!! Heard this on a local station and was completely fascinated. The sound is excellent as well the dynamics and artists themselves. Very happy with this purchase.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Doesn't get any better than the U.K. when it<br />comes to class! We loved every disc and can't<br />wait to get the next series of the 4th Season!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Taubes has done a much more approachable job here in this briefer book. While not a simple &#34;how to&#34; book, it addresses the issues and motivates one to ignore the massive amount of terrible advice that has been foisted onto us over the last 50 years by crumby medical work and political pressure from carb growers. Never forget the &#34;food pyramid&#34; is an invention of the Agra-business and has nothing to do with health, while having everything to do with crops grown in certain states.<br /><br />This book is well worth reading!
B00915G6WQ|3.0|This series has completely done a 180<br /><br />it has basically and blatantly JUMPED THE SHARK<br /><br />Dexter has been found out by Deb and eventually Maria.<br /><br />and what could be worse than the lead character who we have grown to love and care for turn into someone we can barely stand?<br /><br />Dexter isnt following his code much anymore, turning him into an unlikable typical serial killer<br />Some great acting by Jennifer Carpenter though especially in the finale( and the final climactic scene)<br /><br />IM hoping the next seasons redeems itself<br /><br />This is by far the worst season due to the Jumping of the Shark<br /><br />Still its Dexter! Its Recommended!<br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and<br />all of them.

0061191981|5.0|This is the way like to read autobiographies. Just like I love my steak red and bloody I prefer autobiographies raw and uncensored. One can clearly see Ramsay wrote this book himself and did the editing in his own style.<br /><br />I didn't know Ramsay had such a tough time growing up in poverty. He never gave up though on his dream to become a masterchef and run 3 Michelin star restaurants. In this book you can read his struggle to start his restaurants and how he became the chef he is today. Ramsay openly tells you all the details of his struggle and also his financial problems, his heroine addicted brother, his abusive father, the chefs he worked for who were even more aggressive than him, the legal cases against him, ...<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this autobiography a lot. Before I realised it I finished reading this book within hours. Recommended read.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I like his style of writing, and is an easy read. It's like Harry Potter in the 21st century
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The hobbit, above all, is lovely story.  It is enchanting, suspenseful and subtle.  This film version butchers it.  Why,why,why?????  For example, there are no orcs at all in the original story.  None!!!  There is actually very little violence until the very end.  So much has been needlessly added to the story.  Also, the faults of lord of the rings have been dragged into the hobbit.  While gollum is extremely cleverly depicted, his voice and lines are simply awful.<br /><br />So, having said this, if one has no knowledge of the original tale, then the film is fine.  Amazing effects, clever characters, and fairly smooth delivery.<br /><br />I could have made a far better film with half the money.

B0055MI8K2|1.0|I have owned these for around 2.5 month now and there are notable problems have appeared that you would not expect from an expensive shoe like this one. I list the problems that I have with the Terra FI 3 so far in chronological order:<br />1. The straps have begun to shred. A week of wearing these and voila they look like an old pair of sandals;<br />2. The ShockPad is like having a stone under your heel;<br />3. After 2 month they start to smell. I even tried to wash them, but it seemed to make things even worse. And the smell is really conspicuous;<br />4. A big crack has developed on each of the shoes' soles. That's simply crazy: I have never hiked in these and used them only on the streets of the city, not even on sand or in the woods...<br /><br />Do not buy these. Please, save your money and look for something else.

B00B69UQEO|3.0|There is a scene in the Depeche Mode documentary [[ASIN:B0000CEB62 Depeche Mode - 101]] in which the band members discover new kinds of music--country, soul, blues, Elvis!--in a Nashville music store.  Not long after the movie was released, \\"Personal Jesus\\" hit the airwaves, and two things happened: 1) DM had a new definitive smash hit single, and 2) DM had a new blueprint for how to write a catchy, cool song by using a bluesy guitar hook.<br /><br />I mention this scene because, in a way, it shows the moment when Martin Gore found a way to create his own stamp on the band, musically speaking.  Of course he was the songwriter and back-up singer, but the music itself--the wide palette of sounds, rhythms, atmospheres, textures, sampled snippets--to a large extent was the creation of Alan Wilder, who had come to the band in 1984 (and would leave the band in 1995 after the apocalyptic Devotional tour).  That M.L. Gore stamp of blues guitar has been a recurring trick in many songs made since [[ASIN:B000002LK1 Violator]]: chronologically, \\"Personal Jesus,\\" \\"I Feel You,\\" \\"Useless,\\" \\"Dream On,\\" \\"Suffer Well,\\" \\"Martyr,\\" and \\"Wrong.\\"  And now, Delta Machine adds \\"Slow\\" and \\"Goodbye\\" to this list.  In the absence of Wilder's intense atmospheres, creepy samples, and multilayered production techniques, and without a producer who significantly influences the band's sound as Tim Simenon and Mark Bell did for [[ASIN:B000000WZ4 Ultra]] and [[ASIN:B00005BL2A Exciter]], respectively, the dominant sound of the last three albums is either the blues-guitar template, or the stark simplicity of vintage synthesizers, or a combination of the two.<br /><br />And that defines the rather narrow sonic spectrum occupied by Delta Machine, as well as [[ASIN:B001IBIQU6 Sounds Of The Universe]] and [[ASIN:B000B2YQX4 Playing The Angel (U.S. Release)]].  Where Delta Machine comes up short, in this narrower band of sound, is in the quality of the songwriting.  Simply put, roughly half of the songs on Delta Machine would have been B-sides on Playing the Angel or Sounds of the Universe.<br /><br />There are, of course, some great songs on Delta Machine, so all is not lost.  The aforementioned \\"Slow\\" is one of them, with a cocky strut that would be at home in the dusty bordello of the \\"Personal Jesus\\" video.  (If we are being unkind, it also evokes television commercials for male enhancement--these guys are not as young as they used to be, after all.)  \\"Broken\\" mines the brooding and redemptive vein that DM already know so well (\\"When you're fallen / I will catch you.\\")  Dave Gahan keeps his vocal treatment far away from the aggressive growl that he resorts to in \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Broken\\" is the much better song for it.  First single \\"Heaven\\" is a standout not only because it is quite good in an Exciter sort of way, but also because it uses a synthesized piano/harpsichord quite effectively (remember when DM used piano quite often?) \\"Welcome to My World\\" is a minimalist techno affair in the verses that lets  Dave carry the tune--only to let the sound really open up in the chorus with harmonized vocals and synthetic strings that suggest \\"World in My Eyes,\\" the opening track of Violator.  \\"Alone\\" also makes use of synthetic strings in a cascading arpeggio, in one of the most memorable hooks on the album.  And so it goes: the best songs on the album are musically the strongest, as the usual lyrical themes of sin, redemption, and (especially since Gahan started to write lyrics) spirituality begin to feel a little shopworn because we keep coming back to the same analog synth textures of Playing the Angel and Sounds of the Universe.<br /><br />Much of what remains on the album--\\"Angel,\\" \\"Secret to the End,\\" \\"Soft Touch / Raw Nerve,\\" \\"Should be Higher,\\" and \\"Soothe My Soul\\"--is not particularly listenable, especially by DM standards.  They sound more like the songs I skip over from Gahan's and Gore's solo albums.  The Deluxe Version has a second disc of four tracks, and while none of them is outright bad, it's pretty easy to see why they did not quite make the cut onto the album itself.<br /><br />Since 1997's Ultra, Depeche Mode have released albums on a very consistent 4-year cycle, almost as if somehow tied to elections or the Olympics.  Delta Machine is the third in a series of three albums produced by Ben Hillier, who had never worked with Depeche Mode before producing Playing the Angel.  And since the sound is driven so heavily by analog synthesizers on all three albums, with slightly diminishing returns on each outing, Delta Machine has an air of complacency about it, as if everyone just said, \\"well that worked last time, so let's just do it again.\\"  But it isn't working as well this time, and it's time for the band to pursue a new (old) direction.<br /><br />I have always been a major Depeche Mode fan--I have reviewed virtually all of their albums here on Amazon.  But I have to say that this album is a bit of a disappointment when I think of the band's past highs.  Obviously, the Departed Band Member Whose Name Is Too Often Mentioned will not be coming back.  Yet there is a noticeable gap when Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher are making albums without some influence that gives their music a fuller, richer sound--the sound that made every album an instant classic from [[ASIN:B000002L75 Some Great Reward]] through [[ASIN:B000002MJC Songs Of Faith And Devotion]].  And until the band stop saying things like \\"Making this album has had a Violator feel to it,\\" the comparisons will not stop happening.  It's nice that Depeche Mode keep alluding to their best albums in their lyrics and song titles.  If only the new music were consistently at the same level as their best albums too.ne of them is outright bad, it's pretty easy to see why they did not quite make the cut onto the album itself.<br /><br />Since 1997's Ultra, Depeche Mode have released albums on a very consistent 4-year cycle, almost as if somehow tied to elections or the Olympics.

B007CKNX28|4.0|Jack White is remaking himself yet again, and the more often he experiments and expands, the better he becomes. I would have &#34;loved&#34; (5 stars) this album if there had been more depth to some of the songs on it - he recorded thinner versions of Freedom at 21 and Love Interruption than the more fully orchestrated versions of those songs he performed on the Grammy Awards Show. But that's just a personal preference - the guy has it going on vocally, instrumentally and innovatively. Nearly perfect album.

B007HC3LHS|1.0|I love a mystery, but sometimes one can be too mysterious even for me. That was the case with Into the Darkest Corner, a psychological thriller by Elizabeth Haynes:  I suddenly realized after reading nearly a third of the darned thing that I had no idea what it was about.<br /><br />Okay. I did have some idea. Catherine Bailey, the heroine, is a single woman suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder, apparently brought on by terrifically bad experiences she had several years before.  Catherine is so obsessive and compulsive, in fact, for the novel spends scores of pages simply going over how she locks and then checks, then relocks and rechecks her apartment door.  Repeatedly. Ad nauseam.<br /><br />Catherine seems to have two men in her life – a lover who is the focus of whatever chain of circumstances turned her into a nervous wreck and a doctor who lives in the apartment upstairs who takes a liking to her as a neighbor and tries to help drag her back from her mental illness.<br /><br />And that is pretty much the sum of what has happened so far, 120 pages into the novel. The only real action has been a drunken co-worker’s attempt to force Catherine to kiss him – an effort that was broken up before the unwanted sexual contact occurred.  For most of the book, there is an aura of violent menace just below the surface of daily events, but that is it.<br /><br />For a thriller to thrill me, I require a bit more than that.<br /><br />Elizabeth Haynes isa police intelligence analyst when she isn't banging out thrillers.<br />On the surface, this should be a winner. Haynes is a police intelligence analyst and she has clearly done her research on obsessive compulsive disorder because she hammers Catherine’s disarrayed state of mind at every opportunity.<br /><br />And the woman can unquestionably write: her language is elegant, her periods fully rounded, her vocabulary excellent.  The dialog seems believable and the relationships between protagonist Cathy and the other characters so far have been credible.<br /><br />But the book just seems to sit there, inert, without enough action – of any sort, physical or psychological --  to maintain my interest.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, Haynes’ first novel, otherwise I wouldn’t have read as much of it as I did before giving up.  I am sure that something must happen by its last page because it  was selected Amazon’s best book of 2012 and I am told a film based on it is in development.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I felt that by the time I was more than a quarter finished with it, the author should have shown me at least one bit of drama reward me for having suffered through all those door and window lock checks Catherine keeps doing. And I felt that if I continued reading this novel without that reward, I would be demonstrating a sort of obsessive compulsive behavior myself.<br /><br />I reluctantly give it one noose.  If I find myself with enough time and energy to take another crack at it and it turns out that I gave up too soon, I may revisit this review. But for the time being, I can’t really recommend Into The Darkest Corner.e other characters so far have been credible.<br /><br />But the book just seems to sit there, inert, without enough action – of any sort, physical or psychological --  to maintain my interest.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, Haynes’ first novel, otherwise I wouldn’t have read as much of it as I did before giving up.

B0076DELIG|4.0|I had never heard of thriller writer Michael Connelly until my friend Pat Sullivan mentioned his name in response to one of my rants about Lee Child’s Reacher series; I think it says a lot that after I finished The Black Box, Connelly’s latest novel featuring LAPD detective Harry Bosch, I was sorry I hadn’t started reading his stuff when he first started putting it out 20 years ago.<br /><br />The Bosch books (Connelly also writes legal thrillers featuring an attorney named Mickey Haller, including The Lincoln Lawyer, on which the film starring Matthew McConaughey was based) fall into the classic police procedural category, a genre that begins with the protagonist (usually a detective of police) being assigned to a case (usually a murder) and investigating it, step-by-step, until the malefactor is arrested or otherwise brought to justice.<br /><br />True to this form, in The Black Box Bosch fights departmental indifference, a hostile and essentially imbecilic supervisor, an internal affairs investigation and a crooked law enforcement executive while methodically investigating the coldest of cold cases: the execution-style murder of a Danish freelance reporter and photographer during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The hero of this novel has the virtue of verisimilitude: Unlike Child, whose hero, Jack Reacher, is a superman, genius and expert marksman, Connelly keeps his action believable by presenting a protagonist who is a somewhat creaky police veteran close to retirement age. Harry Bosch makes deductive mistakes and sometimes misses clues or misinterprets them. Although he is a good marksman with his handgun, he can’t free himself from bonds by brute strength, or overcome a half-dozen villains in hand-to-hand combat; in one section of this novel, he exhausts himself simply by walking through a muddy orchard after nightfall.<br /><br />Black Box author Michael Connelly uses police jargon sparingly<br />but to great effect.<br /><br />What’s more, Bosch sounds like the cop he is. Connelly uses police jargon sparingly, but the terminology he inserts in his dialog has the ring of authenticity.  His other characters also have unique voices.<br /><br />Consider the section of the book when Bosch takes his teenage daughter, a handgun enthusiast, to the police range for simulated &#34;shoot-don’t-shoot&#34; exercises. Both Bosch and the range master are jazz fans, and their discussion of different musicians seems as natural and credible as the technical terminology they use to discuss the simulations Bosch and his daughter face.<br /><br />And although the musical discussion turns on artists who are probably unknown to the average reader, Connelly makes it easy to follow and the interchange helps to establish Bosch and his police chum as real people with interests outside their jobs as cops.<br /><br />Compare this to the stultifying Popular Mechanics approach Lee Child uses in the Reacher books, each of which contains thousands of words of technical readout about guns and ammunition that do little to push the story forward or make Reacher seem like a real flesh-and-blood individual.<br /><br />Connelly also manages to cover the procedural bases of his novel by recapping his protagonist’s investigative techniques, explaining what he does and why without suffocating readers with too many boring details, dead ends and bum tips.<br /><br />He skillfully adds texture and depth to his story by giving us glimpses into Bosch’s fitful romantic life, his relationship with his daughter and his interaction with his departmental co-workers, but he doesn’t overwhelm us with personal details that pull us away from the mystery his detective is trying to solve.<br /><br />In other words, everything in The Black Box is there for a reason, which adds to the satisfaction the reader feels when the climax occurs.<br /><br />And not every loose end is neatly tied up at the end of the book: enough strands are still trailing that the reader actually hopes some of them will be taken in hand in the next installment of the Bosch saga.  For instance, when we finish the last page of this novel, we are unsure how Bosch will manage to recover a working relationship with his moronic boss and whether he will somehow patch up his romantic entanglement with the social worker he has been dating. Most intriguingly, we never find out why internal affairs Detective Nancy Mendenhall, the investigator who has been probing misconduct allegations against Bosch, takes critical actions that put her on the scene at the novel’s denouement.<br /><br />(To discuss Mendenhall’s role in too much detail would raise spoilers, but suffice to say her actions remain a mystery when the book is over, and I, for one, suspect we are going to see more of her in future Bosch thrillers.)<br /><br />The police procedural style has yielded a large number of popular crime classics, among which are the 87th Precinct stories by Evan Hunter (Ed McBain),  gritty LAPD detective novels by Joseph Wambaugh such as The Blue Knight and The Choirboys, the Jim Cree/Joe Leaphorn tribal police stories of Tony Hillerman, tales involving Martin Cruz Smith’s politically incorrect Russian militsia detective, Arkady Renko, and the Martin Beck series by husband and wife team Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo.<br /><br />Because they closely adhere to established investigative techniques and often feature them as a key element of the narrative, procedural novels have gained sufficient international popularity to allow the main characters to be shifted out of their native countries in motion pictures based on them.<br /><br />For example, Sjowall and Wahloo’s protagonist in The Laughing Policeman, Martin Beck, became Jake Martin, a San Francisco detective in Stuart Rosenberg’s  1973 film version; and Hunter’s 87th Precinct investigators from the novel King’s Ransom (1959) were transformed into a Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department team investigating a kidnaping in Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 movie, High and Low.<br /><br />But one of the things I most enjoy about procedurals is that they frequently fit into the red noir category of literature that I have discussed in some of my earlier essays:  thrillers that serve up a critique of modern capitalist society while masquerading as entertaining genre fiction.<br /><br />The Black Box certainly fits this pattern: Bosch’s investigation uncovers corruption in high places as well as the use of corporate profits to buy influence and political power. A public servant is unmasked as an assassin who serves as a hired thug for a twisted businessman.  While he is trying to ferret out the truth, Bosch suffers interference from a departmental superior who could be a pointy-haired boss right out of the comic strip, Dilbert. In fact, his immediate boss, Lieutenant O’Toole, is a living example of the Peter Principle: managers tend to receive promotions until they reach their level of maximum incompetence.<br /><br />Bosch even runs afoul of the LAPD’s chief of police, who inserts himself in the case for political reasons in a way that threatens the detective’s ability to close it with a definitive solution after two decades. Through all this capitalist corruption and administrative ineptitude, Bosch soldiers on, the rumpled knight without illusions that Raymond Chandler wrote about in his 1950 essay, “The Simple Art of Murder:”<br /><br />“Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor. He talks as the man of his age talks, that is, with rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness.”<br /><br />That brief passage describes Michael Connelly’s detective, Harry Bosch, perfectly.  I feel better for having had the opportunity to meet him in The Black Box, and I look forward to a long and satisfying friendship with him in the future.investigating a kidnaping in Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 movie, High and Low.<br /><br />But one of the things I most enjoy about procedurals is that they frequently fit into the red noir category of literature that I have discussed in some of my earlier essays:  thrillers that serve up a critique of modern capitalist society while masquerading as entertaining genre fiction.<br /><br />The Black Box certainly fits this pattern: Bosch’s investigation uncovers corruption in high places as well as the use of corporate profits to buy influence and political power.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I am not a fan of history --- but I was captured, I was taken back, I was put in touch with the feelings and the possibilities, the pressures, and the agony of this time and this decision. The contrast was never greater at this point in our history  and the film pointed this out magnificently. Although not having anything to compare to, the quality and the verbiage used, and the research it must have taken to capture this historic icon was incredible, as many reviewers have stated Mr. Lewis deserved, no, ran away with the Oscar with this performance....<br />Methodical in it's pace, much like Lincoln himself, at first it was a bit agonizing, but yet I am coming from a time of instant this and instant that.  Can we even begin to imagine a time where messages were  written and then run down the street?<br />Brilliant film.

However, i've read 2 other dan brown books (angels and demons and digital fortress), and I can say after reading one book, you can figure out what will happen in his other books.  However, with that said, I'd say it's good to read at least one of his books.

I thought the ending should have finished a few minutes sooner or have had some more to the ending, unless there is going to be a part 2 soon. Also, a better mirror could have been picked out instead of a metal gong, so then they wouldn't have to ask how they look, they could just look in the mirror and see for themselves.

B003EYVXTQ|5.0|This somewhat dark story is nevertheless a realistic portrayal of the impoverished existence of backwoods meth dealers steeped in the traditions that bound them together as families and that kept them locked in a depressing existence. Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding as a teenager trying to keep what's left of her family together.

B003QTUQGU|2.0|Burton and Wolverton's mash-up is a rather disappointing piece of cinema. The Alice stories should be perfect for both the Burton treatment, and the awesome CGI techniques now available, and yet the result is somewhat ponderous and lacking in charm. Burton injects all his trademark quirkiness, and the cast do their best to invigorate the dialogue, but their efforts are undermined by the floundering, uninspired script. It's watchable, and it certainly looks nice, but if fails to fully engage. 2.5/5

B0030B621W|4.0|What is human? That was a question the late great Philip K. Dick asked many times throughout his career, and that's what Jones and the writers ask here. MOON is an assured first feature from the son of David Bowie, and is reminiscent of the 70s sci-fi classics. If you've read much SF from the 60s and 70s the premise of this movie will already be familiar to you, and that's where the film's only weakness lies: it's a little predictable. But it's intelligently written, is directed with aplomb, and boasts a tour-de-force performance from Sam Rockwell. It's also nice to see a small-budget, British production show that intelligent SF is still a valid form of cinema. Engrossing, thought-provoking, and entertaining.
0547564651|5.0|In today's world, and the world of the 2020's and 2030' when my grand kids will be competing, the competition for jobs and quality of life will be difficult, in my opinion. So I thought if I started out now, when they are preschool, I might be able to help instill a desire to stick to a task and not give up so easily.<br />It also helps me think about how I approach a task that I might now want to do or complete
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The story itself is interesting and important; I'm even more impressed with the way in which Owen represents the spirit of the SEALS and the USA, and credits his teammates and others who gave selflessly for the cause.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Let me start by saying although I love science fiction, I'm not a fan of dystopian stories. So when such a novel overcomes my innate objections to this sub-genre, it has to have great characters, narrative, detail that makes it real, and a satisfying denouement. Wool hits all the points.<br /><br />Howey's character development is most impressive. I'm going to get a tad technical here, so please bear with me. Wool was written in third person limited, which means the only character whose head the reader should be able to see into is the point of view (POV) character for that scene or chapter. Here's an example where Howey added flesh to another character through the eyes of the POV character: \\"Jahns glanced over and saw that her deputy's gaze had crept toward that dark crook in the hill. He covered his mouth with a fist of sharp knuckles and faked a cough.\\"<br /><br />Most of all, it was the quality of the writing that allowed me to suspend my disbelief and ignore the some of my objections to the plausibility of the silo \\"world\\"--essentially an underground biosphere. I still wonder why Howey didn't use geothermal energy and heating, the best source of power readily available to this underground environment that he created. One thing that made me buy into the author's vision was his attention to detail while leaving enough for the reader to imagine and play with. I felt the reader needed this insight into how the silo could provide a livable environment that would support a viable population for hundreds of years.<br /><br />Even though most people don't read such things as acknowledgments, I would have liked one, and was disappointed that it was missing from my edition. Perhaps there's one in the print edition.<br /><br />This is one book that I will read more than once.<br /><br />Review first posted on my blog, Random Thoughts of an Accidental Author, 3/30/2013
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I've liked Bon Jovi since I was around 6 years old and have enjoyed every twist and turn they've made musically. This album has songs that fit most every emotion/situation in life if you're willing to really delve into them.

B000XUBFE2|4.0|I will start off by saying this book did not move me. I can't really say why. I just didn't find a deep emotional connection. However, I am very happy I read it. I truly enjoyed the storytelling and unique voices of the characters.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book has very good stuff about how women can advance their careers and avoid mistakes that thwart their career advancement. Some points in the book are<br />* Men in general tend to be overestimate their abilities and achievements whereas women underestimate. By simply being aware of it, you can manage and promote the right people<br />* Our society primes men to be the ambitious kind and women to be the nurturing kind. We don't like it when we find a person of a gender opposite what we expect them to be - for example we have bias against a stay-at-home dad and an ambitious woman.<br />* The more a woman achieves, she is less liked. There are two studies that show that both men & women have this bias. So before you make a statement like \\"I don't like that bit**\\", think and ask yourself - do you not like her because of the bias we as a society have against women at the top?<br />* Women subconsciously make choices that in the end eat up their careers. So at every step a woman should ask herself is this the right choice to do at this point in my life? Basically be ambitious when you don't have responsibilities and kids. That way when you do have those responsibilities, you will be in a better position to deal with them than otherwise.
0670026557|4.0|I have been looking forward to this book because I have heard so many positive things about it leading up to its release. It is a very well written book, and I am looking forward to reading more from Adam Grant in the future (a business professor who is a professional magician too . . . only good things can come from that combination). As talented as Grant is, and you can tell just from reading it how much work he poured into the book, I felt that it fell short in ways that other recent books have succeeded.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that \\"Givers\\" are more successful in the long run, for a variety of reasons. This is especially true now in the United States because so many people, up to 80%, work in a service industry. Giving pays huge dividends, and Grant proves his theory with anecdotal evidence backed up by research studies.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br /><br />* The first chapter was very good. The argument that givers are more successful across a wide variety of fields is made succinctly, and the evidence is hard to argue with.<br />* Love all the practical tools in the last chapter.<br />* Stories chosen throughout the book are all new to me - no rehashing from other business books, which is a plus.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like:<br /><br />* Though the stories are different, I was not compelled by most of them. They were interesting, but the connection to the chapter material lacked in some places.<br />* The first and last chapter were great, but I would rate the middle as mediocre. Every chapter felt like it was just too long, like the publisher had a quota to fill and just stretched the material as far as it would go to get up to 300 pages.<br />* While I agree with the premise, I'm not sure I would be convinced if I hadn't already been on his side before reading the book. Did not read like a persuasive book.<br /><br />I wish the author would have interspersed more practical application throughout the book. A book in a similar vein, [[ASIN:1594487154 To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others]], offers practical sections at the end of each chapter. Pink also argues for a new approach to business based on our service economy and, while he doesn't define them as givers, they come to many similar conclusions. Because I just read Pink's book and because of all the practical application, I will be recommending it over Give & Take should anyone ask. Would be hard to recommend reading both - as good as Grant's book is, there are others available that are more suitable for a wider audience.N:1594487154 To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others]], offers practical sections at the end of each chapter.

B004J64QSI|5.0|We watch this show on Public TV all the time. Now we own it without the fund raising interruptions at a great price.  The singing is fantastic (for those who are annoyed with Nick Jonas, he is just only one of many fabulous voices), the staging is excellent with a hugh cast, and the ending is exceptional as key members of the original production come on to sing several of the main songs from the show with current cast..

B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is a Disney/Pixar animated film about  a Scottish princess named Merida who thinks that she is trapped by tradition and wants to create her own fate. Her ambitions are at odds with that of her mother and one fateful decision to change fate has dire consequences. The music is great and the animation is brilliant. At times it can be a bit to violent for wee ones but a teddy bear or a grown up can make it alright. I definitely enjoyed this film! Highly recommended. 5/5.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love this series....it keeps you on your feet the whole time. Love the way the characters interact and it gets a little uglier each season.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I saw this fabulous movie on another website at the time which was less expensive than Amazon. I am so glad I didn't wait because the movie was extremely thoughtful and presented a great deal of reflection in our lives. It is too bad that this movie was passed over for the Best Movie of the Year. I saw Argo and was very disappointed in it and know that it was given the Best Picture of the Year because of Movie Politics. Never again will I ever believe any rating that is given by the Movie Picture Academy Awards staff. They suck to put it mildly.<br />Wish I could give Life of PI one hundred golden stars. Recommend this movie to all. I will see it again and again.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I had looked at this book in the bookstore many times, but I just didn't need another novel to read. When I could get it delivered to my kindle and smartphone, it was now in a place where I actually read. It was very good. I wish it hadn't ended where it did.

I heard it first playing in Barnes and Nobles as background music. &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia&#34; and &#34;Love on a Two Way Street (cuts 4 and 5) had the familiarity that makes you listen with one ear, draws you in, and makes you want to hear more. It won't disappoint.
038572179X|4.0|I bought this book because I needed it for school but I ended up really liking it. I had already seen the movie but our instructor told us the book was very different so I started to read it with an open mind. It was different and in my opinion better because of all the details and how well the characters were explained and developed throughout the book. Definitely a must read.

B005EM8O8O|3.0|I feel uncomfortable to write this because I have read many of the Harris' earlier books and enjoyed them.<br />First, I found the first half of the book (or so) boring, and even considered to abandon it. This is the worst thing one could say about any book, and a &#34;suspense&#34; book in particular. In the second half the action starts and suspense builds up. At this stage the reading flowed uninterrupted. However, the crisis resolution was again disappointing. Many instances in the plot were left unclarified (in my opinion). A good suspense book ending should give the reader some feeling of satisfaction, but I found very little of this feeling here, if at all.<br />I cannot escape the impression that this book was written primarily by having the movie in mind.
0465011012|4.0|This book was a quick, easy read. I am normally very interested in books of this subject, but this one was just missing something. And North Korea is the most interesting place in the world in my mind. It just seemed like everything was very one dimensional. Even in the brief moments that there was a glimpse of emotion, it was usually the same as the time before, and it was short and not very well explained? I'm at a loss at what exactly this book is missing. It's a good book, it's just very simple, and that might be due to the translation, I'm not sure. I just wanted something more.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|After reading reviews on other similar cases, I decided on the Marware Vibe mainly due to price.  I have an Otterbox for my phone but the $60+ price tag for the Otterbox Kindle case just seemed unreasonable for a $200 device though I am sure it is of very high quality.<br /><br />But onto the Vibe... took it on a business trip last week and it did a great job.  When the Kindle is placed correctly in the case the auto-sleep/awake function works beautifully.  The ability to stand the Kindle up for hands-free viewing works nicely as there is enough friction to keep the device from sliding, and you can adjust the angle to satisfy almost any viewing situation.  The elastic strap slips on and off easily and quickly and I really like the leather-like feel of the case when holding it for web browsing or playing games.<br /><br />I noticed a slight smell on first open but didn't think it was as bad as some other reviews mentioned, and after about a week it's not even noticeable unless you put it right under your nose... of course I have no reason to do this but maybe some like their Fire HD up close and personal (instense Angry Birds maybe?).  The case does cover the HDMI and USB ports when closed to keep out dust etc. so you have to leave it open when charging but this isn't an issue for me.<br /><br />The case itself doesn't have any kind of screen protector when open, so I added some Tech Armor screen covers to minimize fingerprints and reduce glare (recommended as well).  These are more of a personal preference and not totally necessary as the Vibe case stays closed thanks to the elastic strap.<br /><br />Just shy of five stars because the material on the back of the case bends a little awkwardly when you stand the Kindle up, but this is just an aesthetic issue and does not affect function.<br /><br />Normally I avoid the cheapest item in a category, but don't be scared of the Vibe.  Great function, feel, and value that gives you and your Kindle some peace of mind.
006117758X|4.0|This book was definitely entertaining to read, it had a great story and flow, and I enjoyed it. Almost wish it was longer! Which is good with any book.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|A REALLY fun game. It's just like temple run but Some what easier. You can even login to Facebook and play against your friends
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Now I know why this game is called &#34;Angry Bird.&#34;  This is a fun game that requires calculation of movement.
B00A8307BG|4.0|I have followed him since the Bridge of Sighs cd, long time fan.  This is a different Robin since those days and he has changed the intensity of his music. The Thrill is Gone is a much softer version, then the original version from B. B. King.  His Arthur Big Boy Crudup version of That's All Right Mama, I Believe, Born Under a Bad Sign etc.  Overall this is a slower, maybe bluesier, Robin Trower.  So if you were a fan of Victims of the Fury, Bridge of Sighs this may not be the CD for you.  But it is good, it is just part of the continuous changing repertoire from this artist.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Fun and time consuming game.  Can play for hours.  Just gotta remember to limit how much time I should play
B00AJLHULW|4.0|Robben is one great guitar player and sometimes when you listen to him it takes you just stop breathing because you want to hear every note. This is a softer version with a smooth instrumental &#34;On that Morning&#34; is a perfect example of how good of a guitar player Robben is.  I really liked about 1/2 of the CD and the rest was good but I was hoping for more guitar.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It would be better if you could update earlier and change your skin and texture pack needs more mobs like wolves and ocelots and endermen needs actual nether portal.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|I have a lot of music from the Allman Brothers and this version is as good as the &#34;Live at the Fillmore&#34; concert.  Duane Allman was truly gone before his time and I need another version of the songs that he plays on.  As Allman Brothers fan this is a must have.  Great music and an excellent live recording.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good read.  I've read it twice now and enjoyed the highs and lows.  James has out done herself with this one.
B00B23O96A|1.0|Really, good night Irene, All of Me, and Folks on the Hill.  I know Eric is a senior citizen but I was never listened, liked, or enjoyed those songs.  I really should not have bought this.  I enjoyed the Jamaican version of &#34;Further on down the Road&#34; and the slower version of &#34;Still Got the Blues&#34;.  I love Gary Moore's version but this is okay.  But as a CD this ranks right up there with Reptile as being the two worst CD's released by Eric.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|A few good cast members but ultimately this movie is made FOR children and my adult mind cannot suspend disbelief and rate this movie any higher.
B000002I7H|5.0|I bought this CD to replace my worn out LP. Nothing new here, just classic Albert King. If you are not a fan of the blues then Albert is the place to start.  Great singing voice, restrained but very effective guitar.  You cannot help but love this CD. You have 17 songs to pick from with classics like &#34;Crosscut Saw&#34;, &#34;Oh, Pretty Woman (Otis Rush)&#34;and &#34;As the years go passing by&#34;.  Albert is the best. I have about 400 different blues groups so this isn't my first rodeo.  I like B.B., Freddie, Muddy, Otis, Little Walter, Buddy, SRV, and many others but no one can put you in the mood better than Albert. Let him play the blues for you.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My seven year old son sleeps like a. Baby and so do I.  Being able to customize your sleep sounds is incredible.
B008NR8YTQ|3.0|This is a tough one to review.  Great interpretation of Jimi but it is not Jimi.  I can appreciate how difficult it is to play some of his songs but when you watch or listen to Stevie Ray Vaughan playing \\"Voodoo Child\\" live he just rips through it.  I have a lot of Gary Moore's music and this was just uninspired.  I thought he could have done better. He has Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell on the CD so I have to go back to Gary as the reason it just didn't come across.  I listened to Mato Nanji of Indgenous play Red House and other Hendrix songs and I thought he did a much better version from a sound and performance standpoint.  But, it is very difficult to find a tribute CD that exceeds the original artist. So this is good and it might be great if you don't have the original performances.  But you owe it to yourself to buy Electric Ladyland to find out.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Best game ever. Very addicting and fun. Great for trips and studies...also a great time waster, well worth the dollar
B007MJ9LA2|3.0|Okay, i didn't give it a five because I don't like all of it.  I have bought the recent Santana CD's and listened to the varied vocalist perform and I have liked a lot of them but to me, Santana has always been more about the music.  Shape Shifter (the song) can give you those goose bumps about half way through the song.  Carlos is just taken you on a musical journey like he did on the Blues for Salvador, &#34;Now that you Know&#34;.  Shape Shifter is the best song that I have heard from Carlos in ten years.  It alone is worth the price of the CD.  &#34;Nomad&#34; just picks up where SS left off and grabs you right from the start with the pounding drum beat and lightning fast riffs darting in leading up to a change of pace.  The &#34;Angelica Faith&#34; comes in with the &#34;Aqua Marine&#34; style that just flows backed by a base layer of electric piano with him playing over it.  &#34;Dom&#34; starts off line it was recorded with a full symphony behind it. For me those four songs are the CD.  If you left the rest off and made it an EP it would get four stars.  The best thing here is if Carlos is finally dumping the commercial formula and getting back closer to the music.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It may take a few tries to find your preferred noise but it's great then. I have had no problems running it on my Kindle Fire.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|My favorite song is &#34;Who's Been Talking&#34; with the opening from Howlin' Wolf but &#34;Dislocated Boy&#34; is a very close second.  If you don't know Joe then you have been living in a musical cave for the last ten years.  This guy is a great, maybe the best, guitar player that has ever played.  Yes I put it in print.  He plays Z.Z. Top, Led Zeppelin, Clapton, Albert, Freddie and B.B. King and just rips from one to the next.  Just listen to the beginning of &#34;Lonely Town Lonely Street&#34;, the songs are different, the music has variety and energy and then move to &#34;Heavenly Soul&#34;.  Totally different, from Blues to Rock.  If you cannot tell I am an avid fan of his music and I am naturally prejudiced but this is a CD that is worth getting.  I have others that I may rate lower but this is a keeper.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally love this game... would recommend this game to everyone... I have no problems with this game at all... get it...

B00B99KJR0|3.0|1st gen Kindle Fire, FAOTD. This follows the basic rules of many match games. Here, there are a number of levels for each country to take you around the world. Finish the levels to collect items that complete each country's mission and travel to the next local. Between each country, there is a brief and simplistic story-line (that you can skip). There is a timer that can sometimes be slowed. Increasing difficulty is made in blocks, locks, ice and puzzle board shapes. The graphics are beautiful and I wish we could see more. The music is ok, but repetitive and I turned it off (in game). The game does request you to rate it frequently, but gives you the &#34;don't ask me again&#34; option that I really appreciate (whether I use it or not)! At first, there were adds every time I opened the game that were easily closed but those stopped. There are no in-game ads. Overall, the game is well-constructed (I'm currently in China). This is a good match game for those with the patience for a time investment. Personally, I can't get too excited about the goals in the game. I've experience some lag time when making multiple matches, but there is always the option to repeat any level and improve my score. Not sure I'll ever play it again. Great FAOTD, decent at $2.99.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|My low price source for replacement DVDs.  Combined with Prime shipping, this is the place to get a missing movie to fill out your sets.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It's a fun game, I like that the puzzles are wash. I just wish that you could zoom in closer on the puzzles.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Great prices for these older movies.  I needed a replacement and this was the lowest price found anywhere.  Now I need to watch it again, and the sequels.
B000FA675C|5.0|Keeps you glued to it. Never a dull moment. Ten times better than the movie. I would recomend everyone should read this

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking up married was a fun quick read.  Looking forward to more of the same.  Mira Lyn Kelly is a new author for me but will be looking for more by her.
0547569653|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It's a little hard to follow at first as it jumps around a little bit, but after a few chapters you start to feel all the bits coming together.<br /><br />It was inspiring to read about someone average raising the bar and pushing himself to the limits on the path to becoming an elite runner. If only more people in the world were like Scott Jurek. I highly recommend to any running enthusiasts. In fact, I highly recommend this book to anyone.<br /><br />Happy reading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm 31, married with two kids, and a bit of a redneck. This is a great story that I did not expect. Great twists and turns and I loved the political commentary from a perspective in the not bright future.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The story is good and action is quick to develop not dragging on or sparse. Can't wait for new episodes.
B001RT89TC|5.0|This is a masterpiece by Schenker. A must have for any Schenker fan. I had this back in high school and just purchased it again. Every track on this cd is great.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It's fun besides the time issue!! But definitely buy the one without a demo I have  it it so much fun!! RECOMMENDED
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|There are hundreds of reviews on this movie, heres mine. Lincoln is a good film. The progression of the story covers the events of Jan. 1865. The story itself gets 3 stars but the cinematography pushes it up to four. Not a civil war film as the entirety is a political event as the thirteenth amendment is pushed through the congress. 2 1/2 hours long it goes slowly. Watched in two parts on the kindle is my recommendation. Daniel Day-Lewis was a good choice to play the president and brings the subject to an understanding some of Lincolns decisions. Maybe someday similar treatment for Jefferson Davis.
B005LLX582|5.0|About half of the people I insisted watch it, hated it.  But it is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|This is a great everyday watch.  Simple, classic and practical.  And it arrived in perfect conditions.  Totally love this watch.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|ok rather easy but some what entertaining.kids would like it I think.  Good for an airplane ride. Simple but many levels
B003VDZK8K|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold delivers a great album. I listened to the entire album yesterday and there is not a bad song.
B008I34YYY|4.0|Campy and funny. Good special effects for this ytpe of movie. If you don't take this movie to seriously then it will be funny and enjoyable.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a wonderful recount of two men on different sides and what happened to them. The stories are so well meshed and put together perfectly, a great way to keep you up to date with each of the two men.

B0014JGDUC|5.0|I wear them to work and they really do keep me from slipping and they are very comfie.They also clean up really easy.
B00BKELJZ0|5.0|I grew up influenced by the music of the 80s and 90s, particularly jazz and rock.  After the 90's when music lost it's flavor to the industry having grown too large and too concerned with commercialism, I almost stopped listening to the radio, nothing really inspired me.  Hiromi is the first in years who had me riveted to the car stereo speakers, on the night I heard &#34;Delusion&#34; on our local  jazz station.  I went right out and bought her CD Voice and it became a staple in my daily music shuffle, I never get tired of it.  Her latest album &#34;Move&#34; is just as much a musical odyssey as her last.  Hiromi is without question the most gifted musician I've ever heard sit in front of a piano. I'm quite sure when you play her music for the first time, you'll think so too.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is truly the best show that has ever been on tv.  The only problem is it they only made one season.  I highly recommend it to all.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I really enjoy this show, not perfect, but very good! It makes me wonder who dies next! Plenty of action, good suspense, and it seems believeable, given it isn't real, :-)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game may look fun but I can't play it. It makes me sad.Please help me how do you make a amazon account.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is very similar to Space Invaders,but has a nice twist to it! The improved graphics and gameplay make this game so much better than the original! Using touch controls,you can drag your ship all around the kindle screen. The ship will automatically shoot. You can avoid enemies and shoot them later because the screen automatically moves forward and will continue moving forward until all enemies have been shot. This game brings back classic nostalgia, and give you space invaders fun for hours!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love HIMYM. It is my absolute favorite show. I quote it practically on a daily basis. It is the most relatable show ever.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is Avery interesting app. I have played many matching games and so far this one has  all but one of them beat. I really enjoy the pieces of different items. Though this is not a new concept the kinds of pieces and having gradually more pieces is wonderful  I really enjoy this game. Thank you.

B005H9B44A|5.0|Great movie.  Great download.  This is the fourth time I've seen this movie and still like it.  Yey Marvel!  Next is Iron Man.
B00003CX95|5.0|All went well with this purchase of a historic or landmark film. The spectacle and fine acting of all the actors truly is a masterpiece of film art. Mel Gibson was at his peak and prime, as far as Hollywood Stars go. Not a dull moment in this nearly 3 hour depiction of a true character and surrounding history.  Breathe taking scenery and action coupled with very tender emotional sequences will be pulling on your heart strings for sure!  Have a box of tissues nearby for you and anyone watching this film!  If you value your film collection and don't yet have this one, believe me when I tell you that your collection won't be complete without it!<br />The special features on the DVD are great! Getting much background on how the film was shot, along with interviews from Mel Gibson and other stars only make's one realize how great an accomplishment this film was back in the 90's, and even today holds it's own amongst the top 5 Films of the modern film period!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a fan of DeMiñle but this book was too long, with too much detail? I found myself skipping ahead.
B005ZUR724|5.0|A very robust mmo definitely adds more hour of entertainment to my kindle. Feel and plays slot like WoW. Easy controls for a tablet. Great price too. =)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! First book in a long time that I couldn't put down. It constantly kept me guessing as to who the characters really were. The two main characters had equal parts contemptable characteristics and admirable characteristics. The ending perfectly suited them both.

B00377V6J2|5.0|It showed them working together playing and the great influence that Albert King had in helping to form the path for Stevie's short carrier.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book was great. An easy to read, detailed, and extremely insightful how to book. This book did not come across as preachy or boastful. However, it is a challenge for authors to consider their craft, build real loyal readers, and target those readers. I love the explanation of bad reviews. We all get them but what are they really saying. Thanks John for sharing your knowledge and giving me some homework. I can't wait to tell you how my success has started because I took your advice. BTW I am heading to your author page to start reading your books. I guess I'm one of them.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|A real eye opener of Ireland in the 1940s, at least about the poor people through the eyes of a child.  Just the day to day was such a challenge.  I enjoyed the book, but if you read it, don't bother watching the movie, it skips so much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is one of the most fun games on earth but it needs redstone and herobrine is seen frequently I love multiplayer<br />IT IS TOTALLY WORTH FIVE STARS

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another Jack Reacher success. The twist & turns in this one keep you thinking & trying to figure out the plot ending. People may slow Jack down but can't stop him. I am looking forward to another of his books.

B008B68IUY|4.0|My almost 9 year old daughter was thrilled to get this from the Easter bunny.  She has quite a collection of Monster High dolls and they are happy to have wheels so they can get around.  Their drink cups that came with the school fit into the cup holders, so they stay hydrated.  The back trunk opens up for storing their shopping bags.  Seatbelts  go into the top sides of the car.<br /><br />You do have to be careful that their long hair stays in the car so as not to get caught in the wheels.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the car, and why I docked it a star, is there are no side doors.  It makes getting the dolls in and out harder, and honestly, how can you have a car with no doors?<br /><br />But, my girl doesn't care.  She's playing with it right now and is very happy, so I'm happy.  I would definitely recommend for any MH fan.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Might be abit biased since the hobbit was the first fantasy book I picked up as a kid and couldn't put it down and the movie did the book some good justice =)
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I labored through the 2 1/2 hours, but not w/o taking a personal 5- minute intermission. I was the only mid-thirty-something in the theater; most folks where sixty, but mostly seventy or older w/ an occasional forty or fifty year old here or there. A few seemed to enjoy the show, even clapping briefly at the end, literally like three of the 100 people there. I'm actually not entirely sure though if it's because they enjoyed it or because it was finally over.<br /><br />Granted there was some historical infotainment in the flick, it still misrepresented the understanding of Lincoln I've read of in history books over the years, or heard about in sermons. I think the only thing the movie perhaps got right was its depiction of Lincoln's abolition of slavery, but that's all the movie was about (THE ENTIRE TWO AND ONE HALF HOURS!) Nothing of Lincoln's hardships as a boy with the death of his mother, or the struggle in his law practice before becoming president was ever mentioned. Lincoln's character isn't portrayed as exemplary as it should have either. For example: \\"Lincoln was intolerant of profanity, but it is nevertheless prominent throughout the film; in fact, he is shown using it and turning a deaf ear to those around him who used it. In this, the movie \\"Lincoln\\" is not only highly inaccurate but also not worth viewing and repeatedly exposing oneself to extreme profanity.\\" - wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=134130<br /><br />If the movie wasn't free for me to review I would have waited for it to come out on DVD, or better yet to air on TV. I'll probably never watch it again, as there are better representation of him in other video formats like the History channels documentary.
0321544080|1.0|I bought this book because I heard Joe McNally speak at a recent photography expo. But I should have known better because like his speech, his book is entertaining but in reality just a collection of \\"around the campfire\\" photographer stories. I really feel kinda ripped off.<br /><br />Many of the shots in the book are uninspiring, even if they were difficult to make, requiring thousands of dollars in lighting, and access to helicopters, $3400 angel wings, not to mention celebrities and inside connections. Some of the images (such as the straight-on flash photo of Donald Trump, Don King, and Mike Tyson on page 161) are just an excuse for McNally to brag about where he's been and who he's seen. Other photos seem like just an excuse to talk about other photographer friends (e.g. \\"Oh you know Jim!  Well, Jim being Jim, you just had to be there. What a guy!\\" - this sort of talk, because the average reader does not know these people McNally references and frankly does not care - this is just more fireside talk, which I understand some people love as entertainment)<br /><br />Other images in the book are flat out admitted were just dumb luck - like the eye laser photo on page 168. There is no lesson here, other than sometimes you just take a bunch of photos and hope one of them turns out. Again, just some unhelpful bragging.<br /><br />The only truly helpful piece of advice I got from the book was where he talked about how fiddling with the details of a subject during a portrait shoot can inspire confidence and loosen them up to where you can get a good shot because it breaks the barrier and they understand you're \\"on their side.\\" Other than that, I didn't get much from it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I understand why some people love this guy. Joe was the only presenter at the expo to get a standing ovation for his talk because he used his time to reminisce about \\"the good old days\\" and show us a slideshow of the best shots of his career. Basically us paying him to advertise himself. It was entertaining, but the real reason everyone ate it up was because they:<br /><br />A) Seem to only admire and respect fellow photographers who have been in the business their whole lives (especially if they began their career with film - the younger presenters at the expo who were making tons of money didn't get much respect even though they were making bank) and<br /><br />B) Old photographers LOVE LOVE LOOOOOVE reminiscing with such people about how great everything used to be and how young photographers today suck and how they wish they could yank us by the neck, slap us around and force us go back to the film days where everything was difficult and you \\"really had to know what you were doing\\" --- and yes, Joe McNally got huge applause at the expo when he suggested slapping a youngster for this very reason.<br /><br />Bottom line is I'm reselling this book. It has no re-read value at all - one of those books where you read it once and you're done.vertise himself.

B00571F26Y|3.0|Eventually became frustrated with style of presentation, repetitive and self indulgent - further editing may have helped this.  Would share this with folk intrigued by premise.  Regardless of my feelings about book we are now wheat free.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Awesome film, anybody who listens to or is inspired by any kind of music should see this film. I would love to hangout with Dave.
B004PGNB1K|4.0|Broad scope, tight telling of story - keen to read third. Recommend to all lovers of fantasy and the series itself to anyone thinking of dabbling in fantasy.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I enjoyed the storyline and the different countries we had to visit. I was definitely stumped on a few of the levels. The reason I give this game a 4 star is because it sucks my phone battery so quickly and cannot be moved to my sd card.
B007JGAR6U|4.0|I thought I needed this flash to shoot a party for a friend. Turns out I was underestimating the low light, high ISO capabilities of the X Pro 1 and could have shot the whole event without a flash. Regardless, I've now got a well built, solid, handy little flash to use when I need it.<br /><br />I have two gripes - the beam is so wide I had to make my own snoot to narrow the flash pattern down a little for my purposes, and you can't shoot with rear curtain sync if you have the flash set manually.<br /><br />Other than that, it performed wonderfully. I had no issues with slow recycling times because I usually keep the flash set at a very low power setting. And one set of Eneloop AAAs lasted the entire 3 hour party shoot.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|We enjoyed this movie on Lincoln and wish the movie industries made more like this rather than some that are made.

B00136JQMI|4.0|A true classic in the music world. A must have for any jazz fan. And the price was great too.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great read. Sort of resembled 50 shades of grey without the smut. LOL<br />Read this book in one day (matter of fact, missed a night's sleep to finish it)!<br />It's amazing how what you think you want in a relationship isn't what's best. Your past forms your views for the future . Collin and Megan are the type of couple that defies the norm and amaze those around them. They go through the rough patch all couples go through when there is no courtship.<br />Beware of the cocktail party - more drama starts at parties than any other venue. Is alcohol really truth serum?
B00503BN1M|4.0|Love Ashton Kutcher, and this was a perfect role for him. The movie had some good laughs throughout. It was worth the rental for sure.

B001R10BM8|4.0|I ordered this on Amazon UK for under $20(£9.96) shippped to the US. It is region free so it will work in the US. It was released on April 1. 2013.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|First of all I'll make it clear that I'm a fan of the music; I have both the 10th and 25th Anniversary Concert Performances and have watched them many times. I had the good fortune to see Les Miserables performed on stage and have always found the music to be very stirring.<br /><br />For days after watching either of the two concert performances I found the music haunted my thoughts and drew me back to the story.<br /><br />Like most other fans I was looking forward to the time when the movie version would be released so I ordered the disc and had it delivered the first day it was available. Visually the movie is powerful and rather overwhelming and takes the viewer on a high impact journey through the streets of Paris in the first half of the 19th century.<br /><br />There were some points where the journey was almost too gritty and became rather hard to watch. From a strictly musical perspective I found the movie to be less satisfying than either the 10th or the 25th Anniversary Concert Performances. It almost appears that the drama of the story was given more priority than the drama of the music.<br /><br />That is not to say there were no grand moments in the musical performance, there were, but too often the drama of the music was eclipsed by the drama of the scenery and action and that was a slight disappointment to me as I watched.<br /><br />I will not make direct comparisons between the musical performances in the movie versus the same performances in the two concert performances; I suspect everyone will have their favorites.<br /><br />If one is a true fan of the musical, I suppose it could be expected that they would have recordings of all three and could select which one to hear depending on their mood at the time. The movie makes a powerful and convincing addition to the collection and along with the two concert performances provides rich entertainment regardless of the mood of the moment.<br /><br />This one is a must have for any fan of the musical. The quality of both video and audio is outstanding!The quality of both video and audio is outstanding!

B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I think this game is very fun but you have to wait like a long time to go to the next level . you know is like time consuming :l
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The author used such a wealth of beautiful words to describe so realistically a fantasy juxtapositioned on reality.  Sometimes I felt as if I were floating into a scene with the characters., and often could almost feel the temperature, the fragrance, the illumination of the various exhibits.  I was somewhat disappointed with the ending.  It was tied up too neatly, like a Hollywood ending and was less believeable than the fantasy encased plot.  I want to reread it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading the first few pages, I was hooked.  The author is a true master of surprises and you never know what you might find on the next page or chapter.<br /><br /> As soon s I finish writing this, I am going to purchase the next book of &#34;Wool&#34;.<br /><br />On a side note, I am glad to hear about Bernard and what became of him.  Don't worry, I won't let the cat out of the bag :)
B009YQJ322|2.0|Let me start off by saying I love SIFI and really love my 3-D TV with 3-D movies. However I have discovered that when it comes to 3-D movies ,not all that glitters is gold and with the price tag on them what I have been doing is previewing the movie in 2-D  by renting or getting them from my library. By doing that, I have been able to save myself from throwing good money down the bad drain.<br /><br />Now to Dredd. My take is it was nothing new , and it had a one beat note plot. What I felt Carl Urban did , was to do his or the director's vision of an imitation of Sylvester Stallone from the original movie ,Judge Dredd. Much of this movie was dark which I have seen in other 3-D movies and does not show well.<br />One thing I must say that there were a couple of parts that that looked like it could have been cool in 3-D . With all that said, I think I saved myself some money by not buying this one because all it was about was one after another bang, bang you're Dredd

B00BOLE7X0|1.0|The manufactures are asking $19.99 to buy the HD instant video. This is outrageous! As long as they are asking such a ridiculous price, I won't be buying. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives for entertainment. I think DOJ needs to investigate \\"price fixing\\" again.
B004XISI4A|5.0|I was concerned beforehand, reading reviews that complained about lack of resolution, and vagueness of the plot.<br />Having now completed it, I think the complaints are due to the fact that this is a series made up of a myriad of threads each of significant length. So there isn't going to be any quick denouement. And the plot will require attention to keep on top of.<br />I found this book has got back the pace & engagement of the first part of the series, and I'm looking forward to the remaining volumes to the far distant conclusion.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I've loved this book since I was just a young girl. It has been many years since I read it, it was as if I were seeing the March family with new eyes.<br />What an endearingly everlasting story. I only hope that future generations of girls will continue to keep Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy in their hearts.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Totally forgettable movie, poor screenplay, marginal acting. Just another movie Hollywood wants us to believe is something special, doubt anyone will remember it in just a few years.
B0000C8AV3|5.0|When I look at music I first look at the people playing, their abilities as musicians. And the chemistry as group of people. I'm not interested in selfish musical wanderings, which Dylan was totally capable of. I like a good song. Period. I don't want to have to dig so deep and pontificate about it. I just want to be sung to in a straight forward meaningful way. Just sing me some damn sings and do it well. Entertain me. Set a mood. Make me remember a moment in time. And maybe make me tap my foot a little. Dylan sometimes does this, and sometimes DOESN'T. I can't think of any Dylan album that I just start at the beginning and listen straight through, thoroughly pleased from beginning to end. But this album does it for me. Its by far my favorite Dylan album, and one of my all time favorite albums period. I love the band. Mark Knopfler,  is of course, showcased nicely. But most people aren't aware that the rhythm section are Jamaican legends Sly and Robbie. They are a legendary bassist and drummer team that have played on hundreds upon hundreds of reggae recordings. They are THE go to reggae rhythm section, period. They are phenomenal together. They've played so long together, they are almost like a singular instrument. Mixing all those talents with some solid songs by Bob, and you have an incredible record. I can't believe it wasn't a bigger success. The production quality is awesome. It uses some of the technology, recording wise, that was just becoming available at the time. But does it in a very classy understated way. I wish Dylan had been smart enough and able to keep this line-up going for a few records. If you were looking to buy one Bob album, not including a greatest hits or best of package. This would be the one. And if you're the type that still like to play LP's, buy this on record. Its sounds better on vinyl. It was mastered for vinyl. Anyway, very good stuff.

B0068AWO00|4.0|I actually loved the original as a teen the remake of this story was even better. Bloodier and gorier, but the characters and story made up for it for me.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is the first eating plan I think I can do for the rest of my life.  It makes sense.  If you over-indulge one day, you deal with it within the week, so you are always in control of your weight.  The 500 calorie days are not that hard because you know you can eat what you want the very next day.
B008602KQI|5.0|Whether you've read the book or not, this movie is a fun ride thru th HG world. I can't wait for the sequel.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I adore this movie and have seen it several times.  If you're depressed or sad about something, put this movie on and you won't be for long.  It is the best feel-good movie ever.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This was a great deal on this movie. Got fast shipment (on day it was released).  Love that it came with a copy I can play anywhere on any device
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I'm sorry, I thought I already rated this movie.  But, I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  I rented it an halfway through the movie, I knew that I had to buy it.  I let my BFF borrow it and she was wild about it too.  It is non-stop action from start to finish and it really makes you think and re-think History's facts.  I love, love, love this movie and I want to know why it never made it to the theaters.  I waited and waited for it to be released to theaters, but it never was.
1616550414|5.0|Zelda is awesome. I really like this book, and i like hoe they try to put a timeline n'ff said.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is somewhat like I Spy and I love it very much! I would reccomend anyone yo play this game.
B003QTNFHW|4.0|There was a few connection issues streaming but overall not bad. Ease of use was good and I liked that we could come back later to finish the movie.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The Tree of Life was just a wonderful movie. Great visuals and great actors. this is a movie your going to love or hate no grey area.
B00012QM86|4.0|Package arrived intact and quickly.  While viewing the show, about half way through the scenes would slow and stutter.  I shut it down for about 10 minutes, then restarted at the same place.  it worked fine for about 5 more minutes then started slowing and stuttering.  I continued to watch it and it returned to normal again.  Not sure what the problem was, but my machine never acted like this before or since with other videos.  The seller would have had no way to know the problem as the packaging was as new and had never been opened.  I do no blame the seller for this problem but scored it one star short of perfect<br />Don
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|It was a great item and at good price. The sending was faster and safe, Thanks a lot, hope I'll deal again.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|GREAT PROGRAMMING, GREAT ACTING, COSTUMES, AND WRITING THE SHOW IS EASY TO FOLLOW, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FOLLOWING EPISODE.
B003VTZTU8|2.0|Kept repeating the same information. Stopped being interesting about half way through the book. Lost me with some of the statistical methods.
B000FC2L1E|3.0|It's not the best in the series but I sense that this book may be setting the scene for the rest of the series.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Not bad. I look forward to seeing the differences between the show and the comics. Overall it is going as expected.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved it.<br /><br />It's as easy to read as a Percy Jackson novel, but adds a layer of cultural trivia that makes it a much deeper experience. I couldn't put it down.
B009KEN87O|5.0|It's not fancy, but it's exactly what I want in a game -- challenging, progressively hharder levels with the introduction of new elements, and intuitive controls and directions. Thanks, devs!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was strange and sick but very good!  Twists and turns throughout the whole book.  It was hard to put down, Gillian Flynn is an expert storyteller.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|I love this movie. It's an awesome story of love and redemption. Julia Roberts is stunning and Richard Gere is charming.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is game game is awesome and fun! It is definitely one of the best games out there. My favorite part is the competitions!
B008AITJ24|5.0|Although with some trepidation I bought the next series. I did not regret it. Some shaky moments but  then very solid. They are a great real couple. They balance the act perfectly. I am looking forward for season eight.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app for anyone with a Facebook account! I definitely recommend this app to any tablet users. I use it every day
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Second book did not fail to keep me enthralled in this series. Lots of twists, turns and surprises left me dumbfounded and wanting more!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Like many readers, I became interested in this book after watching the documentary about the war in the Pacific. This book provides a riveting first hand account of the battles and the boredom. The writing is clean, unvarnished, but polished.  Highly recommended.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Well written and a pleasure to read. I enjoyed the characters and had a good laugh and cry over it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|As usual, the hype that goes with an Academy Award winning picture sometimes oversells a film -- Argo is funny, fast-paced, suspenseful in just the right way. It does an excellent job of putting the viewer in the mindset of the American public in 1979.  Because of all the hype (and the history) the film plays more as a heist film (how will they pull it off?) than a thriller (will they survive?), and is all the more pleasing for that.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I found the pace a little slow and drawn out but over all I enjoyed the story and the memorable characters.
1400069807|5.0|Can't recommend this book enough.  While it does show that the food processors play some pretty nasty tricks to get us to eat increasingly less healthy food, it also shows that they really don't have a choice.  If they want to stay in business they have to make these unhealthy decisions or they will quickly be replaced by those that will.  Even companies that have honestly tried to create healthier foods (Kraft) eventually must cave or they are run over.  Without new regulation we will continue the race to the bottom...
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I found The Rosie Project fun and enjoyable to read. It is intelligent and well written. I would definitly recommend it
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|I was rather shocked by the language in this film and the homosexual twist to the story. I have thrown it away.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The book took me almost a week to finish, but I got there. This book took up most of my time and the battery on my kindle. It got me so interested in the book. There was amazing descriptions about the characters as if I could see them in my brain. It was an amazing book. I also have watched the old fashioned movie, if I could rate the movie and this book, it would be more than just three stars. The reason I read this book was because of the message in this story: There's no place like home.<br /><br />The chapter I liked the most was when they went to the China Country. I thought that I could imagine the beautiful China princess. This book was amazing and I know that I will read it again.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game.<br />The way the game changes with the expansions is quite innovative.<br />The base game is  very fun but a bit overwhelming I think you really need to unlock all the genes in the beginning.
B00AYHK7RU|5.0|I didn't care much for the Next Day the first few times I listened to it.  (However, I'd had that experience with Scary Monsters(1980) and Earthling(1997)and now both are among my favorite Bowie albums.)  Now, after a dozen listens, it's definitely grown on me- in fact, I think it's in my top 10 of favorite Bowie albums.  Note:  I rank his albums between 1976-1980 and 1995-1999 as his best work; and now 2013-TBD.<br /><br />I'm taking off 0.5 stars, though, because I think it's a bit long (\\"less is often more\\").  Also, the sound is a bit \\"muddy\\"- it reminds me of the Ryko Bowie CDs from the early 1990s (which introduced me to Bowie) before they were re-mastered.  This may be a dumb thought, but is it possible both Bowie and Visconti are suffering from partial-hearing loss (due to age and inevitable hearing loss from loud music), and don't realize how the mix truly sounds?
B00APJLX8E|3.0|Its a kids movie. They will like it, you probably won't. Nuff said. I ordered from my Roku and the quality what top notch in HD.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Breaking news as it is breaking ... cannot get much more &#34;wired in&#34; than this.  Also share your innermost thoughts with people who really could not care less ....
B00846REIS|5.0|What a story must read in my book. Eva And Gideon and Cary. WOW... I could not put it down.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Bought this for my daughter after having borrowed it from a friend.  Epic tale, well executed, can't wait for season 3.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very slow to start, but don't give up it is worth it. lots of twists that you do not see coming
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic movie, As good as The Wizard of OZfrom 1039 or 1940. It is long , but worth the time watching a classic. It's the best movie I've seen this year, get it download or buy you will not be sorry. A true 5 star movie.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|This is a powerful, moving film, but it will not be to everyone's taste. Helen Hunt is great in ther role as a compassionate sex therapist hired to help a handicapped young man grow into a more complete human being. If you are offended by nudity and sexuality or just generally narrow minded, skip this film. If you like poignant and up lifting films that manage to maintain a sense of humor, you'll like this well acted film
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a great game. It has very good grafics, too. When my chain and I play we bond a lot.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was the b.e.s.t book ever! My favourite charaters are Bast ,Carter ,Horus and Khufu.So I recomend it for everyone any age 6+.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|William Landay is a good writer and I appreciate that and the unusual story with ironic twists.  I was totally involved with the characters!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|It has quicky become one of my favorite \\"movies\\". I can't wait to see the musical live again. Ramin and Sierra were delightful!
B00AAQHP66|5.0|When I heard about this movie I thought it would bomb but it quickly caught my interest.<br />It took me through twists and turns, it was inspirational, sad at times and heartwarming but also exciting.<br />Ironically, I was just trying to figure out what to buy my best friend for her birthday before I watched this--I think I know what to get her now!<br />Definitely recommend it and will add it to my collection.
B0091REZMW|3.0|SINCE THE UPGRADE IT CRASHES TO MUCH.  NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON BUTT PLEASE FIX OR I WILL BE DELETING'
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I fought it great on my Samsung Galaxy II. Very light and fast. I switch off between Bing and Opera on my phone.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Not really mind challenging for adults. Maybe for kids. I don't like connecting games to facebook either, nor do I like getting tons of game requests.
B007N31XTY|5.0|Great movie, scenes extras magnificently complement the work of Jackson.<br /><br />I've seen it like 3 times, I love it.<br /><br />Thanks
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The store line brings you right into the family dynamics and the struggles that women of the period were dealing with.  Great show!
B00275EGWY|4.0|This movie is far better than the one on killing Ben Laden involving the same director. I thought the scenes regarding his frustration attempting to reconcile civilian life with the tensions of combat operations on the mark. The ending was particularly fitting.
B004NELBPC|4.0|I find the news on this app informative and easy to navigate.  Oh and Adriana Huffington is hot, there I said it.  ;)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game has great graphics it is way better than the first one you should get  get this app
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Loved the idea of Paul helping the sci fi writers.  Fun road trip  lots of action with little violence.  laugh out loud funny
B000YHE4AG|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Will Ferrell is so funny in this movie as are the cast. I highly recommend this for all year around.
B004EYT932|5.0|Much has been written about the GFC and the several crises preceding it; these include some excellent works of economic history including Kindleberger's classic - but very few accounts go into such level of detail or muster such extensive data to support their key arguments. This work by Reinhart and Rogoff is a masterpiece and a classic in its own right.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|The Eleventh has grown on me some more.  Amy is one of the hottest companions in the 50 years of the Doctor.  She doesn't out do Rose in my eyes, but she comes real close.  The writing and plots are what we've come to expect.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|yet another awesome cd from clutch, buy them all if you haven't already. And if you can see them live do it they are even better in person.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Didn't think I would like # 11, but he seemed to grow on me. Amy is an amazing companion, and really one of the hottest in the 50 years of the Doctor. The writing and plots are what we've come to expect.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|This movie was very long and drawn out. there were very few compelling scenes and a lot of unnecessary talk-singing.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Although the 5th Series is short on episodes, the story lines and writing is still very good.  The only downside is the loss of # 10 :(
B00BHU261S|2.0|This story was dull and boring..Anthony Hopkins was believable as Hitch ...the scenes that I wanted to see were so few and short ...the period costumes and cars I enjoyed but overall the storyline was a drag !!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig never disappoints; the legend continues.  This one is James Bond back to basics.  This is a must see in order to understand better JB.  And Javier Bardem made me laugh so hard!!! Didn't expect that character.
B004LROMQG|5.0|Nice but had trouble with a couple of the disc not playing correctly other than that love Merlin show yea
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is one of the Outlander Series books...these are some of the best books I have ever read.  She is a wonderful writer and you get totally involved in the story.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I liked the book itself, actually. All the characters were either funny or serious. The cover is awesome. THE BOOK'S GREAT!
1451696205|5.0|Entering into new situations is extremely difficult even when one isn't a teenager - - but entering a new school and not beng one of the chosen ones is mind-boggling - fortunately for our Hero he meets a couple of wonderful people and finds his own strength witht heir help
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was entertaining. I played it for atleast three weeks straight! This is a really addictive game. If you have time to spend playing games, this is the gams for you.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I put this on my sons nabi 2 and he loves it but when he hits the hint it automatically charges my card it is the only app that bypasses the parent feature that I have found
B000UR9T8C|5.0|My kids are into super heroes especially Spider-man. Spider-man 3 is another classic into the series. Got to see the good hearted, help ever, hurt never superhero with a dark side, which says that vanity can enter into any heart let it be an ordinary human or a superhero and it has its consequences.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to admit I was skeptical, and a bit late to the fifty shades of grey party, because I took it as a book about lust with a little romance thrown in...I'm happy to say I was wrong of course those are main components in the story, but more so it's the story itself that sucks you in. Always able to keep your attention. From start to finish I couldn't put it down I found myself sympathizing with characters and rooting for others...it's a wonderful start to an amazing trilogy. Enjoy.
1878424777|5.0|This is a must read for those interested in getting to know your  &#34;True Self&#34;. It runs parallel to any religous or spiritual beliefs one might have. It explains our actions and thinking in such a way that anyone can change thier belief system to enjoy a more satifying life. Good Stuff!
B005544V6A|5.0|very good series so was season 2 cant wait for season 3 and 4 and 5. should be a very good show for years to come
B000002IWH|5.0|If you can watch the movie and not shed a tear, you are void of all human compassion and understanding. This is one of the most moving movies of our time.<br />Today, 03-31-2013, twenty years ago, Brandon Bruce Lee was killed on the set of this movie.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful game love it, good way to pass the time on a long day. Have the best time enjoy it.
6305161992|5.0|Okay, Dolph is not a fantastic action hero. I give you that. But how can anyone not appreciate this movie and its role in the Bruce Lee family history. Brandon Bruce Lee, the only son of the great Bruce Lee, was finding his way in both acting and in martial arts. He had big shoes to fill, and I believe he carried a huge burden with him his entire short life. Brandon always seemed depressed. I am no shrink, but go look up some of the interviews. He was always a dark figure. Heck, his vehicle of choice was a funeral hearse.<br /><br />This movie is well made.

B00ABGEFWC|3.0|love it fun easy but after one day it crashed on my kindle fire idk what happened just wont come on
B000FC130E|4.0|Nobody writes fantasy like Gaiman. I end up reading young adult lit to fulfill my Fantasy genre interest, but he writes it for adults without losing the whimsical nature of the genre.
6304806442|5.0|I just watched it again and enjoyed every minute of it.  Ewan McGregor and the rest of the cast are fantastic.  Great story.  Great cast.  Timeless.  I give it 5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Me and my friends think this game is great because if u don't have a pet then u would feel like u do
B008MM9630|4.0|I love this game.. I just wish they provided a password/username just incase something happens to the device you are playing from..
B008YRVW0I|1.0|So I downloaded this game for FREE on my kindle fire HD and I got up to about level 10 or so and the game wouldn't let me go any further unless I bought the game and through out the game it kept trying to make me buy fish and such using real money!!!!!!! And since this game was free you shouldn't have to buy a thing and you should be able to get all the levels!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. But I do wish is we're easier to get gems. They are very important in this game.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|Heck of an album. I'm not sure what pleases me more the fact that the N.Y. critic @allmusic.com ripped them for not writing the same old \\"slop\\" to feed the brain challenged or the fact that they do the Southern Rockin N Roll tradition great!!<br /><br />Major kudos to Whiskey Myers.  Keep going against the grain.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It works good and it is just useful! I don't really know how to explain it further! It is just a good app!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Awesome acting and deep content. A jewel of a history lesson.  Should be required for all college students. Enjoy the thinking man's movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this dictionary it helps a lot on the run and helps my family ,when I need help spelling
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing for a while. I have no problem playing without spending money or having friends that play.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Near the end it was predictable but i enjoyed the layout. I put myself in Johns position and I too wish things would have gone differently. Overall, it was a great book.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|This was exactly what I needed for my karaoke set up. The price was reasonable too. Thanks for the fast service.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much you guys are the best make subway surf 2 you guys can get me on Facebook young haji yeah and you guys are the best
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS SO FUN YOU should get it I play it and it is so awesome but the tnt does not work because there is no way to light the tnt so it can't blow up
B00479SVBU|5.0|What a great product! Does exactly what it says. Had Soundfly BT before but revert back to this product. Some much more informative than BT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|They really make this game so realistic. It's addicting and fun. It teaches little things about horses. The races are fun to. Everything is self explanatory.
0812992784|1.0|Book is boring and stilted. You just picture him writing &#34;he was profoundly depressed by this turn of events&#34; about himself and its just so wrong.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It's refreshing to watch programs that have respect for all, no killings, no cursing, no sexual content and no nudity.  I watch this often and it sets my mood to a well being state of mind.  I miss 'stories' in films these days.....GOOD stories that is to say!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Saw this on Dr. Oz. It really does work. It seems that the biggest complaint is the forcing of raiting which is annoying but I don't really get bothered by that
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This is a book that transcends generations. It is sweet and thought provoking. Probably not what you may expect and a must read for everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game, lots of fun for grandkids and myself.  we all like that it gets harder and harder.  wish you would get thegame called crazy mouse.  it is on the ipad
B0066W1AZK|2.0|Good game for 2 people but it is impossible to check mate the computers. RECCOMEND BUT ONLY IF U HAVE FRIENDS
B008RXYOKY|5.0|These Adapters should come automatically with the machine; they are invaluable. I have a number of FireWire external drives that I could not use because the MacBook Pro with Retina Display does not have a FireWire port. This adapter works beautifully. I then can piggyback additional FireWire drives to the first one.<br />Great gadget!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I saw Gabe Kaplan about 10 years ago in a comedy club in Seattle; I believe that it was \\"Giggles.\\"  I think at the time, he was on sabbatical from playing professional poker or something.  But during his act, from what I remember, he hinted that he wasn't the biggest fan of John Travolta.  At the time I was somewhat surprised, but thinking about it, it shouldn't have been too surprising, really, as the two were co-stars in \\"Welcome Back Kotter\\" at the time.<br /><br />\\"Saturday Night Fever\\" released, making Mr. Travolta a mega-star.  But then, just within the next year or two, \\"Grease\\" released, and it could only have compounded his stardom.  He was very young, probably in his early-to-mid 20s at that time, and surely while he was more than excited about it, more than likely it gave him a big ego.  (That was what Mr. Kaplan seemed to allude to in his act.)  Hey, it probably happens to anyone at that age that has that level of success, so quickly.  But then of course, \\"Urban Cowboy\\" released later, and that was a really entertaining film as well.  More success, more than likely.<br /><br />I've been hit-and-miss on Mr. Travolta over the years; I think a lot of the movies that he's made over the last decade have been more than forgettable.  But he sure had magic when he was young, and in \\"Grease,\\" I actually think that he out sang Olivia Newton John a bit, and she was a very nice singer.  He just had that edge that you're looking for, especially for the 50s genre, and his falsetto on a couple of tunes was fantastic.  And of course, he's always been a very nice actor as well.  But overall, he's probably the most talented as a dancer.  Seems like he's a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some.<br /><br />I finally watched this movie last night in HD 16 x 9, in it's unedited entirety.  Free HBO will do that for you.  And while this film is surely not perfect, it is perfectly fun, kind of like the film \\"Abba\\" in a way but surely better.  This is the only way to watch this film.I saw a bit on \\"Siskel and Ebert\\" a long time ago where they were discussing cropping in film, showing what happens -- in a negative way -- when film is cropped from 16 x 9 to 4 x 3 for TV (they don't do this much anymore with the advent of HD, thank God).  But I was reminded of that episode while watching; catch a couple of scenes where you know if it were cropped it just wouldn't work as the background characters would be gone, and their expressions would be missed.<br /><br />To Mr. Kaplan I say, \\"If I read what you meant correctly, I can understand it.\\"  But to Mr. Travolta I say, \\"If you did have a big ego, I can understand it.\\"  After all, in the late 70s, Mr. Travolta was almost as big as Al Pacino.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Rented it in HD and the picture was good quality but I couldn't give a good review because the dialogue is hard to understand.<br />Can't really blame the movie when Amazon should be responsible for giving the veiwer the choice to add subtitles.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like the part of the dance but I don't want to spoil it for you<br />Really good<br />book get it
B00BU18U82|4.0|Farming simulator casual edition is a good game but the reason why I give it four stars is because you have to buy half the equipment with real money overall good game for the money.
B002N5N5LG|4.0|great series. i will be sad if they start canceling shows like this and many more. ok ok ok ok
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and knew I had to get it when it came out on DVD.  It is an action packed movie with good acting.  No disappointments!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love how you don't run out of energy quickly like you do in most apps. once tu get going you cant stop
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Good movie.  This is a movie I have watched a few times and will continue to watch from time to time.  Never gets old!
B00296A4F4|4.0|I am not interested in watching the details in which these actors were cast for this show and I am not interested in the interviews of the people who did the casting.  I just wanted to see episodes of season 1 and, as of this writing, have not found the actual episodes.  For some reason I am now onto season 2 and viewing its episodes.  I need to figure out how to manage seeing the actual episodes of season 1.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Returns a little slow and redundant. Somewhat repeats itself during returns. Nice app to have if you own an android. Overdrive app for the library better-faster automatic returns from a button prompt.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I always enjoy a good fantasy story, and this one fits the bill. While there are certainly elements of discovering magic and romance with a vampire, this book avoids turning the protagonist into a Mary Jane.<br /><br />While Twilight introduces Bella Swan, whose looks and interests are described once in a single paragraph, as a person whose thoughts are given primarily to her lover, A Discovery of Witches introduces Diana Bishop. Dr. Bishop is a highly respected historian, a lifelong athlete (yoga, rowing, and running), a tenured professor at Yale, and a witch who struggles with her magic. The male lead, Matthew Clairmont, is a man of many histories. He has to reinvent himself every so often in order to avoid being identified as a vampire and the consequent havoc. He has attended Oxford several times, and in modern times runs a world-class genetics facility. His interests are often revealed at key story points, so I won't go into much more detail here.<br /><br />The story is enveloping, the characters start out as complete individuals, and develop with the story. Overall, this book is well-written and I am very impressed by the character development in a vampire romance historical/contemporary fiction!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Wish the title weren't so goofy. I've recommended this book all over the place but as soon as people hear the title, they get turned off.
B00124BNF4|3.0|I usually avoid compilation albums and prefer to obtain the full albums of the artists I like.  I guess that is why I bought this.  The Talking Heads have always been a band I wanted to like more than I did.  Their music has always seemed pretty uneven to me.  There are tracks that I really like but the rest is pretty boring.  Fans of the band will like the whole collection.  I don't like fiddling with my mp3 player while driving.  Listening to this album requires me to skip around a good bit.  I'll just create a playlist of the songs I like from now on.  I had really hoped the rest of the songs would grow on me - not to be.
B0025KVLU6|2.0|The white album seems to have been made in a basement or other non-studio with extraneous noises, pops and clicks.  Many of the songs are experimental and not memorable.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|The Dark Side of the Moon combines everything that is good about Pink Floyd into one album.  Each track flows into the next and the soundscape is something you can really lose yourself in.  This album begs for a great remastering and I think they have delivered.  There seems to be a good bit of depth to the music and all instruments and voices are clear.  I have always loved this album and now it sounds even better.
B004GFN11A|5.0|This app is wonderfully easy to use! It loads fast and is very responsive! Great for uploading photos! Easy to check comments and respond.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|I already have the Sweet Dreams and Touch albums on vinyl and remastered CDs.  I bought this collection to fill in the gaps because I knew they had great tracks from other albums but I didn't want to have to buy the entire catalog to get them.  I really like this collection.  I can play this in the car straight through beginning to end.  Love it!
B002VCR03A|5.0|This is a great book if you like fantasy, action and romance.<br /><br />It's a good read with an interesting plot AND a female heroine who saves herself. Which is about time! The plot is ever progressing and there are no boring parts. It's not wands' and wizards' fantasy, but extraordinary talents and this makes it a non-traditional fantasy.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|I like Taylor's earlier albums, this one is not my favorite. I do listen to it once in a while.
B00873GRU4|5.0|A post apocalyptic tale with a twist. One of the best I have read - very hard to put down!
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|so ive had it for a long time and I had a hammerhead shark almost to a tiger shark and all of a sudden it just started me over!!!!!!!!!!! ( don't care if I spelled sudden wrong!!!!!)
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I have been a Boz fan for what seems like forever.. ok since the early 80's and have loved some of his stuff.. and liked some. Memphis falls into the Loved catagory.  His voice hasnt lost any of its smoothness and the tunes just make me smile.  I am keeping my fingers crossed for a summer outdoor show so I can sip a glass of wine or two and just get lost listening to him play alot of tracks off this CD.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|First off, let me say, I am not a big television watcher. But this show intrigued me from the very first episode. So much so, that I purchased the Season One on Amazon Instant Video and have not been disappointed in even one episode.  This program, features many excellent actors, including the main character, Alicia Florrick, played by the marvelous Julianna Margulies.  Every other actor in this series plays their part to perfection. The plot unfolds in a myriad of directions, leaving the observer not only interested, but unable to walk away until the very last moment.  A satisfying program with wit, subtle humor, intelligent dialogue and legal thrills.  Highly recommend this one!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the game works at first. but after a few times of opening the app and playing it'll open then foreclose. it really sucks.
B003CH9PTU|3.0|I bought Season One of this show on Amazon Instant Video because it had been noted as a funny show and had Bryan Cranston as the main character.  I am not a huge television fan but was looking for some good quality shows to see.  I watched the first few episodes, and although they were mildly funny, I have yet to finish the series.  It just didn't do it for me.  The plot was rather lame, the acting was mediocre.....I just didn't find the show to be my cup of tea.  I will probably watch the rest of the season eventually, but only if I can't find anything better to do.
0783231032|5.0|I love this movie. Item was received as expected. Works in all my DVD players without problem. Not much else to say.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I was absolutely hooked on this show from the very first episode.  I did not want to buy Season One on Amazon Instant Video.....I HAD to.  Showtime had a free promotion one weekend (On Demand), my husband and I watched a few episodes, and since we were not Showtime subscribers, we jumped at the chance to buy Season One.  I had never purchased any programs from Amazon Instant Video before, but figured the price was reasonable, so I thought, why not.  I tried to space out the episodes so we would not get burned out right away, but it was hard because of the exceptionally intense suspense and high drama.  The high definition clarity of Amazon Instant Video was outstanding on my Lenovo laptop.  If you have never seen this outstanding show, do not hesitate.  Buy Season One now, you will be glad you did.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Even my mother enjoyed this movie and she doesnt like animation. Fun for the whole family. Would recommend this movie for family night.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I got this app when I heard the Google Reader was being discontinued.  I like the way it's designed, and it's nice to have all the news at your fingertips on your device.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Well written fast read. Agonizingly depressing. Main character can never grow out of an overly melodramatic and naively pessimistic teen.
B00428CPUY|5.0|The only thing better than this two disc set would have been if I could have attended this great meeting of fabulous musicians all in one spot at the same time.  This annual event in Chicago Illinois has become a Must-Go for people who love the great, classic rock, blues and country musicians of our time.  An awesome gathering, a diverse banquet of music.  Highly recommend!!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It's great quality and fun to use. looks just like the real one, but its plastic. will fool most though!
B008VO3PA4|3.0|Being owned by 2 fat, spoiled tabby cats, I was immediately hooked by this book's title.  I took a chance and bought it, but found it to be only mediocre, not all that funny and definitely not worth the money I paid for it.  Save your money for something else, like a new cat toy for your fur-kid.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this game and how quickly it loads and responds on my Kindle. The ability to zoom in with regular scenes and the nighttime view is very helpful. Lots of variety!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Only downloaded this to kill a bit of time,but has been taking up too much of my time.really simple to play fun game.
085786078X|5.0|Anyone who has a cat will love this book. I have all three and when the next one comes out I'll buy it also.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I was looking for a good series to tide me over between releases of The Dresden Files.  An online discussion recommended The Iron Druid. Very pleased. Good research went into the writing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this is a good game for that! I have it on my iPod and it was harder to get the jumps perfect but now that I have it on my kindle it works perfectly!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Lightning bug has lots of sounds to choose from. I havent encountered any issues. And its free.<br />Some extras cost money but you don't really need them.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I'm not an academic . I could not tell you how accurate or inaccurate this film is . What surprised me about LINCOLN (streamed in high def with subtitles) was it's great humor . This is a superbly well written film (to my mind) , making the various great performances and ensuing remarkable film much easier to pull off . The central performance by Day Lewis is arresting and fascinating . Tom Jones is brilliant . The whole picture is absolutely absorbing . Knocked out and deeply stimulated and entertained , i can't recommend the picture more strongly . See everything you can . See this film to be certain . Meets the criteria of magnificent .
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I have alway been a Stephen King fan  Haven just sparks up weirdness and horror to it's finest.  I will be ordering season two in the near future.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Well written, acted, and produced. Character development two dimensional. I watched it twice and don't recall any of the character's names, or a single memorable line of dialog.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Eh . . . is the first word that comes to mind after watching this film. I did like T.Hardy as the bad guy (grrr) and Anne Hathaway was pretty kick-ass as Cat Woman. The acting was very good and overall it was a good movie but I was not on the edge of my seat the whole time and SPOILER ALERT- I was more upset with the demise of the bad guy at the end of the movie than that of the good guy. That seems wrong.
B009UNH0EM|4.0|I thought I lost my charger, and because it uses this unique charging cable, I was SOL for a while.  So, I found this, and bought 4 of them; one for the office, home, car, and laptop bag.  Then, on the day I got it delivered, I found my original charger.  Still, I am glad I got these because now I don't have to pack one when I am on the road.  I gave it 4 stars because the price is hight (USB micro cables are a third of the price) and they are still only about 6\\" long.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I loved this movie so much I went out and bought all of the books, read them, and now wait impatiently for the second installation of this truly amazing trilogy. The acting is exceptional and the story-line is creepy but kept my eyes glued to the screen. I have actually watched it twice that's how much I liked it, and, not that it matters to anyone reading this review, I rarely watch films more than once. Ok, that's kind of a lie as I have watched LOTR and Hellboy several times each, but I did say rarely so that counts for something. Anyway, great film.<br /><br />Warning: although no animals are harmed in the film if you have an aversion to violence toward children this is probably not the film for you.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Nice mix of themes reminiscent of Lord of the Rings soundtracks mixed with new tracks.  Neil Flinn has an amazing voice.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is such a great film. And I must tell you up front that I rarely watch political thrillers because they bore me. However, this one is amazing. The acting is flawless, the story-line keeps you yelling at the screen . . . I mean sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time. I was alive (though so young it barely counts) when these events occurred so it was kind of cool to see how it turned out, cuuuz like I said I was super young and all I really remember is watching the news coverage of people getting off of a plane though now that I think about it that could have been some other hostage situation.<br /><br />Anywhoo, this was worth whatever I paid to rent it.
0375869026|5.0|I am an adult raising a child with a cleft lip and palate. I saw this book at my local library and decided to read it. I'm so glad I did! It's an Accelerated Reader book for 4th grade level but this book is a fantastic resource for all ages especially in this age of bullying.  It's about a young boy who was born with a craniofacial disorder. After 20+ surgeries and being homeschooled for years he & his parents agree it's time for him to enter regular school for his fifth grade. This book is about his journey among his peers as he strives for acceptance. It's a great book that touches upon important character traits we all need to develop in life. Please consider reading it.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|When my husband suggested this movie for date night I was like \\"ugh.\\" I figured it would be another hyper-dramatic made for teen movie. You can imagine my surprise then, when it turned out to be pretty good. Yes, there is some Scarlett O'Hara type drama (i.e. hand to forehead, swoon etc) but not so much that I felt compelled to role my ever cynical eyes. The acting is pretty good for the most part, the story-line is interesting and it was adventurous, which is what I look for in a movie. I seriously hope they come out with a squeal, which I think they might based on the end of the film.
B0091REZMW|3.0|great love playing little small on kindle but it is okay also hard connecting to facebook.  happy to try it alittle but not for long
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|freind does not get pbs told her about downton abbey and gave her season 1&2  as xmas gift.  big hit gave season 3 as birthday gift  another big hit
B008Y73940|5.0|had plot excitement plenty of entertainment  and they got the bad guys in the end kept you guessing till the end
B00466HN6S|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and it's perfect for Easter. She can't wait to watch it more than once from Redbox.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved it .<br />My son and enjoyed this movie a lot. We don't get to watch movies like this a lot because of the ladies in the house. He really only had this to say.<br />\\"This movie Rocked ...\\"
B00127RAJY|2.0|I have to say the most annoying thing about this DVD is that each time I play it, I have to waste a good five to seven minutes watching the same warnings and her introductory remarks before I can get to the top menu to choose my workout.  Why is that necessary, exactly?  I can understand having to do so the first time, but each time?  Really????  I am a busy person.  I don't have time to waste each morning on unnecessary none-sense.  Regardless of how effective her workout routine might be, because she doesn't respect my time, this is the first and last DVD I will purchase from her.  Period.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|i've had absolutely terrible experiences with record players in the past, including a crosley which simply sounded terrible. i found out this turntable was on sale for $60 at my nearest fry's electronics, and with some speakers i had around the house i bought it and set it up and it works way beyond my expectations. the sound is beautiful, it's lightweight and stylish, and i couldn't ask for more. the automatic stop is great, and so far i've had absolutely no problems. wonderful purchase.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|It is one of those gems that you continue to think about for days to come. A film that shouldn't be missed.
0515153656|5.0|There is a lot's of action. The book was written great. I cant wait to get started on the next book!
B002WJI66C|3.0|I bought this for my 6 year old son as part of his birthday present. It took approximately 2 1/2 weeks from when I ordered to when it arrived in the mail. When I opened up the package, I was disappointed; it definitely is not an authentic looking Boo. It is more cheaply made than some of the other Super Mario plush toys I've ordered. However, I gave it 3 stars because my son didn't seem to care that it wasn't as good as some of his other plushes and was just excited to have a Boo to add to his collection.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Whoever sent it did awesome. It came with more than enough time to spare. However, it skipped several times through the movie while I was watching it so I'm not sure if the previous owner scratched it or not.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|All time favorite movie.  I purchased this cartoon for myself not my grandchildren!  LOL  If you don't have it you need it.
0375842209|4.0|I believe that more people should read The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak. While it may have been kind of slow in the beginning it ended up being a riveting story. Though the book had a lot of sadness , it was a very good representation of Nazi Germany during World War II. It includes many aspects of what happened during the war. Also, Death was a very captivating and creative idea for the narrator. Some examples of this are, whenever somebody died or a group of people died, Death would make it even more sad and  upsetting by saying for example \\"***A Last Fact*** I should tell you that the book thief died only yesterday.\\" (Zusak, 543). When I read this I almost felt heartbroken that such a nice character died with such an indirect way of telling it. Also, another interesting thing that Death did was very directly foreshadow things to come such as telling of a characters future death. Another reason I liked the book was that it was told in the point of view of an innocent little girl, Liesel Meminger. I enjoyed that during such a rough period of time the story had a very innocent plot, such as Liesel trying to steal books because she loved to read. I absolutely agree with AvidBookworms post on Barnes And Noble.com saying it was a very unique book.  Almost everything about it was unique from the story line of trying to steal books during World War II, to housing Max the Jew in Liesels' home.<br /><br />  My favorite character would have to have been Hans Huberman. This is because he was very kind and brave with their hidden Jew Max. He was humble but takes action, such as during the Jew Parade when he gave a Jew bread. He brought hope to people in the book by playing the accordion, and he really helped Liesel deal with her painful past.  Finally he very patiently taught Liesel to read.<br /><br />  My favorite quote had to have been the final quote in the book on page 550 when Death said \\"I am haunted by humans.\\"  While many people may have their own ideas of the quote,I believe that it means while Death has witnessed many people dying, he is still haunted by the destruction of war and people unnecessarily killing each other. Overall I loved this book because it further helps us understand the direba effects and sadness war brings to people and even to Death.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I purchased this movie for myself because I loved the first one so much and I was not disappointed! Buy it!
078322947X|4.0|The story is good, acting good, and the music by Tangerine Dream, excellent.  The jungle scenes are very real and gives you the sense of what it was like to drive through it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. The movie was OK but the trilogy just had me rivoted. Would recommend this to everyone.
B00001W9G0|5.0|What can I say, if you love these actors, love romance, with a little politics thrown in, sit back and enjoy one of the best movies ever made!
1476734941|5.0|Just read this book and started the FastDiet a week ago. I'm a Weight Watchers member, and plan to continue attending meetings and counting points... reducing my usual 26 points plus a day to 7 pp on fast days. I fasted on Tuesday and Friday, ate normally (even eating a cupcake) on Wednesday and Thursday. Weighed in at WW meeting on Saturday morning and had lost 1.2#. Now, that may not sound like much, but for me it was remarkable for that period of time, and eating some Easter candy! Also, walked two days and did Pilates; which is to say that the fasting did not cause lethargy or worn-out feeling. Indeed, I had more energy and feel like 48 (I am 68). The two fast days are tolerable, especially when one knows you get to eat normally the following day. Will stick with this and provide a second progress report in a few weeks. Feeling positive!

B009AMANBA|5.0|In a year of excellent movies, Argo, Zero Dark Thirty, Life of Pi, Les Miserables and Django, this movie rises above the rest and has the real possibility of joining other Speilberg Classics as one of the best offerings of his career. If it is historically accurate it rises to another level, that of historical reference.  If this is the case, Speilberg deserves our thanks, not only as director capable of rendering the finest in entertainment, but as a teacher capable of shining a light on the political process that was involved in resolving an amendment which has become foundational to our national identity and inner strength as a people united under a Constitutional form of government offering equal protection to all under the law. I do not know if the movie took liberties with the facts to the extent that it distorted history but I hope it did not and if it did not then Speilberg has given us another pillar upon which his legacy will endure for ages to come.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Bought this for my grandchildren and they really liked it.  Like a lot of vehicle now their parents have a van with a DVD built in and the grandchildren ask for this movie a lot.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I remember Rodriguez when I was a student at UCT in Cape Town in the late seventies! It brought back a flood of GREAT memories. But much more than that - this life story is about compassion, love and values - about what is important in life and how you live it. This is excellent viewing for everyone!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was thrilling as the first. The characters are thrown Back into the games with even more devious plots in order to kill th hopes of districts once and for all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the whole series.  Was super easty to download.  Wish to have all three seasons so I could watch again.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|you rent this movie anyway.  It sucked.  The characters were unsympathetic and not funny. It was too long (over 2 hours) for a comedy and too stupid for a drama.  The punchlines were 100% in the trailers.<br />I am glad I only wasted $4.99
B006VC3LES|5.0|You have the BEST of All Worlds with Nicholson-Huston-Towne-Polanski.  Let me get this off my chest right away.  Faye Dunaway, like Meryl Streep are probably the two MOST Overrated Actresses ever in Hollywood.  I have Never watched a movie, just because they were in it.  In any scene with Nicholson or Huston, they &#34;Steal&#34; it and Huston steals scenes with Nicholson.  This is a Later Noir Film, Directed by Polanski. Despite Polanski's other problems, he is one of the Top 10 Directors of the Past 50 Years.  There can be a lot said for a Film about L.A., which would have been Nothing without water.  The Extras here are important and a must watch.  This Film made Nicholson a Super Star.  Just Jack's presence can make a film.  This was early in his career, he was the Star and he Made the Movie.  Like, I say, anyone of a 100 actresses could have played Dunaway's and it would have made no difference.  Really, bottomline is this is a Guy Flick.
B003B02OOG|5.0|John Grisham is a wonderful writer. I love this book. all of his books are very down to earth and so real feeling. Reading Rackateer now another very good book.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|The Super Beginning and End for Brandon Lee, his Greatest and Last Performance.  You can see, this is a start of a Superstar career of him, only to be the end of it.  Great performance for Brandon, but only him.  This was meant to be his Tour-De-Force for him.  Somewhat like James Dean, his Superstar was yet to come.  He Greatest was yet to be.  Sad ending, like Dean, of what could have been.  They are like Shooting Stars who Burst onto Fame in a second and die.  Sad, but we were lucky to have seen them.
B003B02O3C|5.0|another one that is a must read. the movie was very good but not as good as the book. must read, very spell binding just like always.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Saw snatches of his greatness, but so darn difficult to read. I could not wait for it to be over. Actually liked the movie better, even though they didn't pull that off completely, either.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really good game but it does freeze up a little bit.  You should get this game. I love it!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Easy to use and easy to stay up to date on current events in the world news.  That's all folks.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I was moved by this presentation of Lincoln's life and the achievement of the 13th Amendment, in particular S. Epatha Merkerson's scene brought me to tears, James Spader provided the humor and Tommy Lee Jones, well his delivery was \\"Tommy Lee Jones\\" and quite appropriate for his character. John Williams' music will draw you in and some pieces are Copeland-esque adding to the feel of the times.<br /><br />It moved slowly but held my interest.
B0042RJWTM|1.0|It this had been a black comedy,it might have been interesting.  As it is, it's a parody of itself--a mere collection of cowboy movie cliches: the bar room, the swaggering, the flinty cigarette puffing, the fist fights, the prostitutes with hearts of gold, the courageous taming of a wild horse, shooting pistols with incredible accuracy, the inevitable sex scene, the outhouse for comedy effect, etc. Jack Palance simply revisits his \\"Shane\\" role and adds nothing to the film but a second major character.  He can appear to be very menacing, but here he decides to settle down, get married to a shady lady, and run the local hardware store! Lee Marvin plays Lee Marvin.  At one point he wants to marry a local prostitute and settle down as well.  The funniest scene in this dreary film is Marvin taming a wild horse.  It's hilarious to see the director try to avoid showing the double who actually made the ride and persuade the dimbulb audience that it was their hero--the aging cowboy women love to bed.  Etc.  Forget this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like knowing how much time I have left. Runs great with no crashes. It comes on automatically when you plug in your charger.
0345529057|3.0|The story is compelling.  There are plots and subplots, a cast of hundreds, and exotic creatures.  The story is also violent.  Every body-part you can name gets hacked off, gouged out, or set on fire: nipples, testicles, fingers, hands, feet, ears, eyes, nose. Intestines spill out and slither away.  Heads are chopped off and mounted on spikes, where they get a second life of sorts as crows peck out the eyes and the elements melt away the skin.  Babies have their brains bashed out and women are raped, usually multiple times.  There are also poisonings, drownings, and people pushed off high places.  And if that isn’t enough, some characters are brought back from the dead so they can be hacked and killed all over again.  Ultimately the violence becomes less realistic and more cartoonish.  BIFF!!! BAM!!! POW!!!  Oh, well, there go a few more.  Wonder if they’ll be brought back from the dead.<br /><br />I’ve started the fourth volume.  As I said, the story is compelling and I do want to see how it ends.  I hope against hope, however, that some external force (space aliens?  A plague?), comes along and kills off every last member of every last royal family.  Their scheming and plotting and violence have become repetitive and tedious.  I long for one moment of peace and quiet on Westeros, and that will only come with the demise of the royals.  I don't know about the common folk because they are not very prominent.  Just one moment of peace and quiet, that's all I ask, but I’m sure I will not get it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Warning! Do not start reading this book if you have anything else on your schedule for the next few days.<br /><br />My wife and I are long time Stephen King fans, so we expected a good read, but wow! This is a masterpiece, a tour-de-force. The grand sweep of history, combined with characters that grab hold and don't let go, plenty of twists and turns and tension.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was more dark than the first two, and has to be my least favorite of the three! I still recommend reading it so you know what happens to everyone.
0316069434|3.0|Detective Harry Bosch looks back at a cold case in which a Danish reporter was found executed during the LA riots 20 years earlier. Good, typical Bosch book and one of his most pro-woman since \\"The Concrete Blonde.\\" Doesn't have quite the energy in language that his older books do. I hope he's setting up daughter for her own series.<br /><br />Now for the audio narrator: Len Cariou got too old to continue to do the books but why not go back to the great Dick Hill, who is so excellent on such titles as \\"The Black Echo\\"? This guy had no feel for Bosch and didn't convey the playfulness and humor in parts of the book. He was business-like but dull; fortunately, Connelly's story was interesting enough that eventually I forgot about the narrator.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Life of Pi would be good to view several times because the images are beautiful and complex.  I loved the book and am happy that the film stayed true to the important parts.  Playing the film was frustrating, however, because the Roku device or something kept stopping the film to buffer, sometimes for several minutes. We could not control the playback or enjoy continuity.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|one of the best movies ever loved it well worth the price thanks amazon this is the best movie ever
B0002V7OI8|5.0|A hidden city capable of supporting 1 million people had been hide in the mountain. It was originally designed for survival of a nuclear winter.  However, it has been covered into an ark to sustain life.<br /><br />I like the landing on the comet, the robot mole, and the attempt to defect the comet.<br /><br />I didn't understand why the triton missiles could not destroy the comet but the teams ordinance destroyed the six mile comet. It makes you think that earth has experience a comet disaster in it ancient past.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I own a Retina Macbook Pro, it does not have ethernet, when i am at the office or at home and are downloading large files, it definitely beats the wireless connection on the mac.  Small, easy to carry, easy to connect. A must for my laptop.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|This is a very exciting book. I could not put it down!  This book kept me on the edge of my seat and was the only thing I could think about when I went to sleep at night. I recommend this book to all teenagers.
B002ONC9NC|1.0|I'll start with a mini spoiler alert here.  The actors do a good job in this movie, but the plot details are so ridiculously unrealistic, I couldn't take this movie seriously at all.  What parents would allow their high-school-age daughter to go out to a concert and dinner with a much older man about whom they know nothing? To take her away on weekends even to a foreign country?  No parent in the world, that's who.  Additionally, the plot fails to motivate why such a worldly older man would be interested in a bookish, thoroughly average-looking schoolgirl.  It just doesn't hang together and the entire thing is sewn together with a very thick thread.  Not worth the time except if you are willing to suspend any belief.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|I stumbled upon this game when I read some top ten Nintendo DS/3DS lists. I had never heard of it, but went ahead and purchased it based on the strong reviews it had received.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story; the premise is engaging and the characters are interesting. The dialog among the characters seemed realistic for the most part and was fairly entertaining, too. It's really more of a visual novel than anything else which is very different than a lot of other games; it helped of course that story itself is so engrossing.<br /><br />A few things about the gameplay mechanics were a little distracting, which I think other reviewers have mentioned:<br />- You cannot advance the text as it's being spoken for the first time; you can only speed it up once you have reached one of the endings. I'm so used to doing that in other games that I found it annoying that I couldn't do the same here.<br />- Whenever I selected an object to enter into a puzzle scenario, I would need to scroll through the instructions again. While this would be helpful if I was just returning to the game after a long break, it's not as much when I already know what I need to do. Since I wasn't able to advance the text, it was distracting. (Some of those instructions could be pretty long, too).<br />- When I did reach an ending, I was eager to go back, adjust decisions and then advance the storyline in a different direction. At this point, I was able to advance the text which was welcome. However, it wasn't very clear to me what I really needed to do to get to a decision point that affected the storyline. Not only that, but I needed to solve the rooms again, which seemed pointless. As such, I quickly lost interest in reaching the various endings.<br /><br />From reading reviews of this game, the gameplay issues have been identified and resolved in its sequel. However, reviewers highly suggested playing this game before the next one, so I went that route.<br /><br />Regardless of the gameplay issues, I'm glad I purchased and played the game and am looking forward to the next one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have found this to be a fun game. I play it with my grandson and  it holds my interest.
B00030590I|1.0|Do not buy from this seller.  Huge important scenes were cut out from this movie.  I've noticed this happening a lot when I buy a movie after I've rented it.<br /><br />Why doesn't Amazon no longer list the running time of this or any other movie?  Aren't you tired of being disapponted when you see it on your television and love it, but then you get a chopped up version?<br /><br />The running time of the original movie is important.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|This is a really solid outing from Boz Scaggs. It's not one of those records that will change your life. But the musicianship is superb and the vibe is true. In a way, it's more reminiscent of his early solo work on Atlantic than than the later Silk Degrees R & B that made him a star. But true to its title, the record is more Memphis than Muscle Shoals. Kudos to Boz and Steve for making this cool little record. Oddly, the most memorable track may be Corina, Corina. Who'd have thought that someone could find an utterly new way to deliver this old standard? In this bare-bones arrangement we can hear what a truly moving vocalist Boz still is--a great track on a very good record.

0374214913|2.0|The story is nothing special.  If you don't understand a lot about computers, Google, etc, I suspect you miss a lot of the points being made.  Plus, I paid for 2 day delivery and got it 5 days later.  So, Amazon failed in my rush delivery and the book is less than interesting.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am very satisfied with my case. It is very easy to slip into my bag and keeps it protected and I don't have to worry about my kindle fire anymore.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so fun and way better than Temple Run! It is so much more colorful and attractive! It has mine carts and a big monkey monster instead of like 5. Its so addictive too!! GET THIS GAME!!!!! ITS NOT A WASTE! ITS AMAZING AND FUN!!!!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Suffering through puberty during the 90's and early 00's, Daria's caustic humour and honey badger-isk attitude towards the woes of adolescence struck a cord with me.<br /><br />When I discovered that the social misadventures of my favorite monotone heroine were available for purchase, I was ecstatic!  At my finger tips was the possibility of obsessively memorizing the best zingers that MTV has ever produced.  I immediately purchased the DVD box set.  It has proven to be just as lovely, poignant, sharp, and exact as I remember, even sans the original music. :(<br /><br />I know, I know.  It would have been impossible to release the entire series and retain all the original music but rewatching Daria without Pink's stupid girl in the background makes me feel a little lonely.  That said, the box set is definitely worth the buy!

0547884591|1.0|You gotta laugh at this guy. No, I don't mean he is funny -- he is sad. Sad, like pathetic. He is a self-absorbent egotist and his \\"cooking\\" book is crap. Totally useless for cooking, or for anything else, for that matter. I must wonder if he took his own advice and had the book outsourced for 1 dollar per 500 words, or some such thing.  Useless \\"information\\", terrible cooking advice and horrible formatting. If you are looking for a cooking book, there are thousands of them that can teach you to cook better. If you are looking for a book how to \\"learn anything\\", there are many better books. Please don't buy this book unless you want to stroke the author's already inflated ego.
0307477479|5.0|When you finish reading a book of a stature such as \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" by Jennifer Egan, you sit down, breathe and keep breathing, till the breath paces itself out and you aren't gasping anymore. The effect of books has to be this way. It has to have the maddening reaction in a reader - the gasping, the constant thinking about the characters and more so how would their lives turn out after the book is finished. Would they have a life at all once the reader has ended the reading? Would he or she go back and revive them? If a book can evoke these thoughts, then it is of the most superb quality writing that existed.<br /><br />\\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" is all about lives being lived and the ones that were lived in the past. The book according to me is all about memories, failed lives, failed loves and how somewhere in all of this, there is this bleak thought of giving hope a chance and seeing where life goes thereon. There is nothing sugar coated in the book. Egan gives the reader, \\"life\\" the way it is - harsh, uncompromising, difficult and sometimes worth living just for all of that. Bennie is an aging former punk rocker and record executive. Sasha is the young, troubled woman he employs. The book is essentially about their lives, their pasts and how it all merges into one big fascinating book.<br /><br />Egan takes us through generations and different people through the two protagonists. The other characters are integral to the plot, because through them Bennie's and Sasha's lives are shown to the reader. The larger themes  of the novel - loneliness, despair, a lost generation, materialism, the quest for happiness is so  deeply embroiled  in the book that the reader would find it very difficult to disassociate his emotions from them. The story skips back and forth in time, so initially, I did face some problem reading it, however once I got the hang of it, it was a breeze of a read. The passage of time is at the core of this book, with Egan orchestrating the entire book and making it fall into place with each character's life revealing itself in each chapter.<br /><br />I loved the second last chapter of the book, which is in the form of a Power Point Presentation. This is the uniqueness that I look for in books at times and it was superlative in this one. Egan's characters are most humane and that is the most heartbreaking quality they possess. They make their mistakes, going through life, wanting to rectify it all, wanting that one chance at redemption to make things the way they were and this is where I most connected with the book. \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" is something that will not let go of you that easily. You will relate with it and that is when it will play on your mind and heart, as all great books do.<br /><br />Here are some quotes from the book:<br /><br />\\"I don't want to fade away, I want to flame away - I want my death to be an attraction, a spectacle, a mystery. A work of art.\\"<br /><br />\\"If I had a view like this to look down on every day, I would have the energy and inspiration to conquer the world. The trouble is, when you most need such a view, no one gives it to you.\\"<br /><br />\\"There are so many ways to go wrong. All we've got are metaphors, and they're never exactly right. You can never just Say. The. Thing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Time's a goon, right? You gonna let that goon push you around?\\" Scotty shook his head. \\"The goon won.\\"

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|While I wrote this referencing the previous Crosby and Nash boxes, the Stills box is much more to me. While I highly respect both Nash and Crosby, Stills pushed the envelope early starting in the AuGoGo singers to Buffalo Springfield to Manassas to Super Session and finally to his work with various forms of CSNY and Hendrix & Winwood. His solo work is somewhat uneven but he also dabbles in so many styles of music that he shows amazing versatility and creativity. I ordered this the moment it was announced and have no true regrets. Most wanted the nine-minute version of Bluebird but it still works fine without it.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I personally follow the Paleo type diet, although I was a vegetarian for 10 years, too. So that's my bias, going into this.  I don't know if Taubes' low carb diet is the right approach and I'm not looking for a diet, in a case.<br /><br />I read this book to read about why we get fat, the calories in and out, and the nutritional and metabolic reasons behind weight gain and loss.  For me, this book finally explains, in a way I can understand, that what I was taught about how to eat my whole life is fundamentally flawed. Thi s helps round out why paleo really works for me and hels me approach nutrition in a better way.<br /><br />If you want your mind blown about &#34;calories in and out&#34;, exercise, and carbs, this is the book to read.

0765325950|5.0|I have a dear brother-in-law that debriefed long ago from a gang and now writes children teaching them how bad gang activity is, however California Prisons don't allow hardback books and he has been such a loyal WOT fan.  I have bought him every book, except this last one.  Now, he is recovering from thyroid cancer and he is so wanting to have the book to help lift his spirit and he will be there for quite a while.  Is there any way that a soft back cover of A MEMORY OF LIGHT?  Please help, as we can get a book for their Library also so that other WOT Fans there who would so love to read this book.  He donates the books I send him after he reads them to go to the library.<br /><br />FYI: He is such a kind person yet was incarcerated as an Adult in CA when he was just barely 16 yrs old...Maximum Security for 15 years until he debriefed...15 years of no sunshine, no outdoors, no human contact...he was afraid to debrief against the gang as they threatened his loved ones and he never wanted in the gang they forced him (as my wife and her brother lived in such lower-than squalor conditions) and that there was no help and as a small boy he was beaten daily by the gang that forced him to be a drug mule then they forced him to shot a guy (if he didn't they would have killed him too) and when they got caught they all turned against him and said it was him acting alone which is not true at all.  He know has a fine Christian fiance and he is loved by so many people in and outside the Prison system.  He is very respected for his anti-gang stories that he writes to children and teens.  He is the real deal.  I just want you all to know that this is not for a thug with no conscience or heart.  Thank You for any help.

B00BGIBVP8|3.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was eager to see it, assuming it would depict the funny side of trying to keep it altogether as the big 40 approaches . . . like doomsday.  Because this is the phase of life I am in, I figured I would get some nice laughs from this comedic depiction of the pressures of 40-somethings.  Unfortunately, this film isn't nearly funny enough for my tastes.<br /><br />The married couple, played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, struggle with too many depressing issues . . . work problems, feeling neglected by their own parents, mooching family members, money woes, and marital arguments.  If I wanted this, I could just read the local newspaper.<br /><br />The movie has a few funny moments and both Rudd and Mann depict their characters realistically (I especially find Leslie Mann effective in this role), but I was hoping for something upbeat . . . and instead I felt a bit downtrodden.<br /><br />Somewhat disappointing.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|My wife and I rented this movie thinking that it would a great comedy to watch on a Saturday night.  This movie is not worth renting or even watching.  The funniest parts of the movie are featured in the trailer and then it just goes down hill from there.  The storyline is very fractured and just does not have a great flow.  After a while the movie stalls out and it just is not funny anymore.  The movie feels like it is having a mid-life crisis itself becasuse it does not know if it is a comedy or a drama.  This is just my opinion but save your money and watch something else.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Lots of time spent in exposition in the first half or more of the novel, but the story needs it , and it really starts to flow round about the middle.  I'm almost at the end and --finally, after all these pages--I'm well and truly hooked.  Can't wait to read vol. 2.  The writer is obviously well-grounded in history and the mythologies of other-worldly creatures, and her version of vampire/witch/demon lore is well-plotted and plausible.  There is a goodly amount of real information to be had, as well as a ripping good yarn.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is an excellent debut album by a very gifted artist. I have a lot of respect for a musician who can write/compose their own music and have such a compelling result. Combining a dubstep vibe with, shall I say \\"sterling\\", work on the strings, provides a rather unique and uplifting set of music. And if you've ever seen her perform live(I count myself very fortunate), you know that she exudes pure joy as the music pours from her soul. The range of songs on this disc shows she can bring a variety of flavors and sensations to make each song its own. I enjoy each and every track be it when I'm on a drive, out for a run, or just around the house.  I wish her a long a successful career.

B00AG472DS|5.0|When i first saw Zodiac a few years ago I was all about purchasing it for my collection. imagine my dismay when i found that Universal had discontinued production of this Blu. No worries its a current movie right? How expensive can it be? Well I had no idea that some people think its cool to charge 150 dollars for a copy of a movie. Needless to say I was not going to spend that money and looked at other options. I first sought out foreign releases of the film because they were on par with what pricing should be. But after some extensive research I found that these copies lacked certain features the american release retained for example the audio was not Dolby TrueHD and was normal DTS 5.1. Another disappointing aspect was the frame rate was less than the US release. So after all of this I never was able to purchase this Blu that had now become my white whale.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years later and BAM!! Universal realizes they blew it and wanted some more cash from us and decided to re-release this wonderful movie. I was able to pick it up for 11 bucks and I have watched it several times since receiving it. Below is an excerpt from a great Blu-ray review site.<br /><br />There are plenty of extras, which are separated between extras on the movie and extras on the actual case.<br />It's all cool and interesting stuff, especially the documentary entitled This is the Zodiac Speaking.<br /><br />This Blu-ray is a must-own. Zodiac is one of my absolute favorite movies, and for good reason. It's subtle,<br />creepy, suspenseful, funny, dramatic, tense, and so much more. It's truly an epic to behold.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I have loved James Bond movies since I saw my first, Thunderball. Daniel Craig plays 007 such that he challenges Sean Connery, the gold(finger) standard.  The problem was that my expectations were so high I was disappointed. This movie just isn't as good as Casino Royal or Quantum of Solace, or many of the Connery titles (I really liked On Her Majesties Secret Service, too, because like Casino Royal, it gives some explanation of why Bond is hard to reach emotionally). Anyway, I am glad I saw it, but I would have waited until it was cheaper if I had known what I know now.

B009IQG5M4|5.0|Co-written by Amy Tan, The Joy Luck Club brings what constitutes one of the finest Chinese novels to the big screen, delivering to audiences a finely crafted drama full of poignant and memorable moments in the vein of modern classics.<br /><br />The story comprises of a vignette of four Chinese women whose parents derive from their motherland, People's Republic of China, and is primarily told from the standpoint of the heroine, whose mother made the tireless journey from China to the United States because she wanted the feathers of the ugly duckling to transform into that of a swan before the eyes of appreciating people who will accept women from their true worth unlike the sexist men they faced in the People's Republic.<br /><br />Basically, for two of the vignettes, the story comprises of a competition beginning from childhood of two women, whose parents encouraged them - one into the pursuit of becoming the chess champion of the world, and the other into becoming the greatest piano player known to man despite the fact that she had no musical talent. One of them, remains single, while the other is married to a Caucasian who finds it difficult to find acceptance in her family, making a fool of himself through his ignorance of Chinese attitudes and practices, bumbling along in his first dinner with her family prior to their marriage. (The supporting actress who plays this character is the most gorgeous Japanese woman you will ever lay eyes on and the most exquisite woman on earth)<br /><br />The other two vignettes revolve around two women, one married to a Caucasian, who initially worshiped the ground upon which she tread despite the fact that she was discriminated against by his parents who considered her to be of too lowly a class to be wed to their son, and the other married to an overly materialistic Chinese man who would calculate to the last penny everything they spend together to be split equally among them as husband and wife - taking the idea of gender equality to the extreme.<br /><br />All of these are interspersed with flashbacks of their parent's history in the People's Republic, as they struggled against the sexism that existed throughout the world prior to the bra-burning era that spawned the feminist movement.<br /><br />This, then, constitutes the basic theme of the movie: women struggling against sexist attitudes, struggling for independence against overbearing husbands, against polygamous husbands who show preferential treatment for certain wives while treating other as sexual objects, struggling against ill treatment from their husbands and, in general, struggling to break free of their social constraints like an ugly duckling transforming into a beautiful swan the way women were meant to be.<br /><br />Without a doubt an Oliver Stone classic that will go down in history as one of the finest Chinese dramas ever made.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play temple run 2 everyday....I cant stop playing because I might luv it to much.If you dont have this game yet you need to get it......
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I  rarely give a five star rating but this definitely deserved it! That's all I want to say don't want to spoil anything. :)
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Like I have written in other game reviews. I am not a huge fan of complicated smart phone games. This game has a decent amount of graphical content and the audio is good as well. The puzzles were a bit tough for me and I lost interest quickly. I don't want to sound like a simpleton but the way you had to solve some of these puzzles was unclear and if you have played this then you will know what i am talking about.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Get it if you like puzzles that require you to look on the internet for answers.
B0098G67TU|5.0|This was my 1st streaming movie on Amazon and it turn out to be a good one. We will try some more again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|For all the minecraft funs, this one is portable, very addictive, serious fun! I have been playing it for months and still love it!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is one of the best hungry sharks yet I love it it is the best its amazing keep doing wat u r doing the best
B005MMYT76|1.0|This movie dragged. It had so many moments where it could have developed a flow in the plot, but just failed horribly to do it. I want that 2 hrs of my life back. Completely dissapointing.
B009CGQKKC|5.0|wish we could all live there highlarious lol the movie is great plays awesome on all my devices buy it
B001EIOOV8|5.0|If you are a fan of this genre then Casino is a must own. I honestly believe this one of Scorsese best works and De Niro and Pesci really shine in this film. I have honestly never been a huge fan of Sharon Stone but she really creates a believable character.<br /><br />The picture is superb and the audio quality is almost reference. So again I would I highly recommend this film if you are in to this genre.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a long time fan of Nelson DeMille and I've followed the John Corey character since the begining. This book was disapointing.  If met my need for another DeMille novel but barely.  The end was so sudden is seemed that the author was just done writing the book and wrapped it up without tieing up many ends.  I would rather that a new character evolve from DeMille than have this character continue with a so-so story.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|You can get lost in time when watching this movie. It is very historic and entertaining. Truly an excellent movie.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am trying it and still confused about the way it works,used to the format on the laptop,but its usable,just have to remember the format is smaller for the screen
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The storyline, graphics, games, puzzles, etc were awesome.  Just when I was hooked, I had to purchase the rest of the game to finish even though it said it was free.  I haven't finished the 3 games like this that said they were free.  I hate it when I am lied to!
B0093QDGEO|5.0|highlarious lol the movie is great plays awesome on all my devices buy it you will like it i promise
B005COO1X6|4.0|This is an awesome story that keeps you turning the pages. In typical Stephen King fashion I was drawn in and kept reading until I was done. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a single, something I didn't realize when I made the purchase. If you are a King fan its definitely a good read, but you will find it too short.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Had to have the kindle version so I can revisit John Corey while I'm traveling this summer and remind myself of why I enjoed the book the first time. I am a long time Nelson DeMille fan starting with The Gold Coast.  Every holiday, when a new hard cover was released, it was on my wish list.  I enjoy treating myself to the old books on Kindle.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|This movie was so funny and had many situations that are so true to life.  Love Paul Rudd. There were a lot of well known actors in this movie.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Maybe a little light on twist and turns, but a solid Bosch story line none the less. I'm interested in the seeds being planted in this book for future Madaline Bosch books.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I really, really like this game, but once again it was advertised as free and absolutely WAS NOT!  If it was advertised as a free trial or something like that, I would have not been so upset when I was really getting into this game and then couldn't go farther without paying for it.  I thought the graphics and color scheme's were really good and I enjoyed the music a lot.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Cool game with plenty of things to do.  The campaign is a great storyline so far and building up your army is super rad.<br /> Grab it and go to war today!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game continues on the great times from the first version, very addicting, can't put it down sometimes, can't wait for oz edition
034580404X|5.0|I've read quite a few romance books in my time and these are by far my favorite. In the span of 1 week, I read all three books and then re-read all three of them again. There's a LOT of sex, but there's also a storyline, plot, and a beautiful story of trust and love. Just don't think too much about the timeline of everything though because everything happens so quickly in these books; it makes things even more unrealistic if you think too much about the exact timeline of events. Just lay back and enjoy these books for what they are -- amazing romance novels. You'll be shocked, you'll laugh, you'll be turned on, and you'll be so glad you read all three books :)
1449410243|3.0|Most of this book was actually quite amusing. It was ruined by an overextended joke in the middle of the book that was about a pair of cats on every day of the week. It went on for pages and pages and was not funny. I look at my cats and wonder because of this book, but wound up returning it because that long joke made me uninterested in re-reading this book. It was funny otherwise though. Jokes are often repeated as well
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I chose this book after reading Gone Girl which I really enjoyed. I thought Sharp Objects wasn't as good as Gone Girl, but I do enjoy the way that Ms. Flynn writes. I look forward to when I can pick up the book and anticipate her next novel.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was my very first book club read. I loved the book at the time because it's my first in this genre but I had nothing to compare it to because I mostly read autobiographicals & self helps. But after I read our 2nd bookclub book Dark Places I'd have to rate Defending Jacob a little lower. Still a great book though. It's an easy read and kept you wanting more to find out who dunnit. The book was written from the perspective of Jacobs father so you really got a sense for his inner conflict and denial about his sons innocence because he was a lawyer. However the character development of Jacob was very flimsy. Other than knowing he was an outsider socially I never really got a sense for who this kid was so I couldn't really get on his side or off. The ending of who killed jacobs schoolmate was just WAY too convenient and you could see it coming. I felt relieved about who dunnit but also felt almost like the writer couldn't come up with anything else to solve the murder. And then the big BIG ending will blow your mind. I didn't see that coming. It was shocking and well made up for who killed ben.
B002Q4U9YU|1.0|The audio was very very bad. The producers or who releases this CD purposely made the music louder than the song. The words on most of the songs you cannot hear. Like someone did not want the public to hear the words.
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|Never been totally in love with acapella, but this is great stuff. I highly recommend buying this album, or at least a song or two.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|the author made u feel like u were there too he told everyone's view of the story I think the reason I like it so much is because I'm dealing with some friend trouble myself it's such a wonderful book  that you need to read

B0026NBZDU|5.0|An excellent novel.  Setting and characters are authentic for the time period- a well written novel from Sarah Waters, I have already purchased Tipping the Velvet and I expect that will be good as well.
B0027MJU00|5.0|i just joined a book club and this is our 2nd book. (1st book was Defending Jacob which was great but Dark Places is way better) I'm totally new to this genre (i mostly read autibiographicals and self helps) but I like the dark-brooding-angst-who-dunnit style of Dark Places. It started off a bit slow but then it got good and kept me wanting more. Character development was great; you really got a sense for who ALL the characters were (Defending Jacob was a bit supercial in character development and I never got a sense for who Jacob really was).  I dont want to give away the ending but i didn't see it coming (unlike Defending Jacob, you saw it coming and it was way to convenient).  One minute you think you know who dunnit but then you don't and the real who dunnit blew my mind. You'd never imagine it in a million years (or atleast i didn't) and the journey to get to the end of Dark Places was exciting and suspenseful, peppered with some disturbing insights and actions of some of the characters. Highly Recommend This Book!
B00006JDVV|5.0|If you like dragons, this is one of the most impressive 'what would happen if dragons appeared' movies that i've ever seen. I love Christian Bale in it and love the storyline.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Excellent entertainment value if you are as big a Game of Thrones fan as I am.  I have read all the boks currently available and hoping HBO will see the series through to the end.
B00006J3WH|5.0|It's Buffy. It's singing. It's amazing. If you loved &#34;Once More With Feeling,&#34; then this CD should be on your list.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I cannot add much to any of the praises already given to this work but will only say this: I have listened to many, many compositions in this genre, as well as most other kinds of music from Zen-contemplative / meditative to acid rock, bluegrass, symphonic... anything but 'gangsta rap' which holds less than no appeal for me. and this remains the most moving, uplifting, inspiring and lushly beautiful of them all.  I think that is will be impossible for any listener to avoid visions of fantasy, heroism, valor, beauty and majesty when playing this. It sounds equally great driving in the car, listening with phones on an mp3 player or - best of all - cranked up on a really good home system. Let me assure you that if you have already shown an interest in this type of music by reading these reviews, you will not be disappointed in any way by owning 'Illusions'. It will be one of your favorites.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is fantastic! runs smoothly and has loads of ideas for every day life! I have had no problems with it and it becomes addictive!
B007PKOKTK|3.0|Good acting on the humans part. And the graphics for the rabbits and the chicks are fine, but the story feels like a rehash of previous Christmas and other holiday tales, of When the son does not want to take over the family business. Note this is not an Easter story whatsoever, they just use it is a prop to introduce a lot of colorful side effects and jokes!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|The Reversal was just as good as the other books I've read by Michael Connelly. Always make for a good read.
B001EN71CW|4.0|My daughter turned me onto Firefly, once I was hooked I need the complete series for my collection.  Well worth the entertainment value.

B000GG4Y3M|4.0|Good movie,Michael Douglas is in true form in this his cop show,He portrays a cop(nice try but he's no cop) the movies dark and is one of his better movies.I give it a 4 Star and Mr. Douglas a 5 Star for his part. A must see....DON'T forget THE GAME! A must see also! His best movie yet.

0062014536|5.0|Full review on Reader's Dialogue: [...]<br /><br />I love the alternating points of view from Lena to Hana. The juxtaposition of the war Lena is fighting, with all the danger and narrow escapes, against the silent struggle Hana has as a cured, paired, soon-to-be wife, heightens the sense of urgency and necessity for rebellion and revolution. Of course, I was hoping throughout that they would meet up and somehow reconcile. And we sort of get that - but it's much more beautiful than I could have imagined. Because Hana is cured, after all, but the hints of her not being totally cured and the horrors that she is uncovering mean that her choices are not all according to the rules. I love that she is instrumental in the final battle. After seeing her struggle every second chapter, that little bit of fight means so much.<br /><br />But as for Lena - her tragic love story continues, and only gets more tragic as Alex reappears in her life after she thought he was gone, after she found another love. And worse, Alex seems to hate her now. She wants to go back to Alex, but she doesn't want to hurt Julian, and Alex doesn't seem to want her anyway. She struggles to find her place in this new and shifting territory, to suppress her seemingly doomed love for Alex, and I love the way the interactions between the two boys mirror her inner struggle. There are a lot of symbolic gestures in this plotline, and when it finally comes to a conclusion, I was relieved that Lena could find peace and love, and that she felt that as she was fighting for the right to choose, she was able to be happy with the choices she was allowed to make.<br /><br />The rest of the story - the fighting and danger - is beautifully written. It feels so immediate, every time the characters go into battle. Twice, people are carrying bombs to be detonated at a certain point, and Lena worries that the bomb will go off in the carrier's bag. I think that's symbolic of how the whole story goes - they plan things, but with all the variables and the danger, they never know when the whole thing will blow up in their faces - and not just in terms of the fighting but also in terms of all the relationships. Some of the people we've grown to love end up dying, and the others are left to cope with these expected but still shocking losses.<br /><br />Definitely a thrilling conclusion to a really great trilogy!the danger, they never know when the whole thing will blow up in their faces - and not just in terms of the fighting but also in terms of all the relationships. Some of the people we've grown to love end up dying, and the others are left to cope with these expected but still shocking losses.    Definitely a thrilling conclusion to a really great trilogy!
B002361MLA|5.0|This is an amazing book for anyone who suffers from anxiety.  If you find that we can't get past the 'past', and think only about the future, good or bad...buy this book!  You don't have to live in the past or future.  The Power of Now can help!  It's a game changer for your life!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game I loved it I play it all the time!!!! you should buy this game and play it. its great
086571701X|5.0|Having never had fish nor an aquaponics garden I purchased this book.<br /><br />It is very informative but does not cover all the aspects of doing your garden along with problems the fish might have other than the normal low ph, ammonia, nitrites and nitrates.<br /><br />Im sure the author could not cover ever aspect in this book such as fish ich and how to treat naturally, which ended up being my issues.<br /><br />I use this book as my go-to and also the many great websites that are out there....this is definitely a book Im glad I purchased as it really taught me a great deal but just understand as with most books you will still have to do your own research but will at least have a great guideline for what else you might need to know.<br /><br />She does give a lot of resources you can use and has her own blog.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I totally randomly chose this book due to an Amazon suggestion and had a horrible time putting it down! I was late on deadlines and downright rude to my husband who hates when I read in the car! This book was great for so many reasons. I loved first and foremost, the sensual relationship between Sky and Holder. I liked that it was teasing and seductive without the Fifty Shades description! I loved that he was a hot, bad boy with a love of lust. I also loved that the book had a fast moving, layered story with many unexpected twists! Yes Colleen, I am headed to Amazon to get whatever else you wrote! Bravo and sorry to Colleens family but I can't wait for another book!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My daughter loves this movies and relates to both boys and girls and childrens and adults.  They did a awesome job making this movies and involving different elements to it.  The plot was cool and lets not forget the ending was good!  The 3d was pretty cool to see.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I got this app as the app of the day. This app, I would say, is just like the other app, the free versioon. Actully I think TUNIN RADIO is better than this app. I would reccomend the free version. The only thing that is diffrent is the picture (which i like the free version picture better :) ).
1594153515|5.0|great book would suggest this read to anyone who may need this in marriage or better yet those who are getting married.
B008D30K7E|5.0|The title may seem a bit slow, and what can a man of 100 years get up to.<br />Well if you want to find out, get the book.<br /><br />All I can say is you will not be disappointed.<br />If you had just some of this mans adventures you would count yourself lucky, that you had more lives than a cat.<br />Brilliant.
B0000042MY|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter.  I prefer the actual movie but seldom have time to watch it repeatedly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the book. Difficult to put down once you started, life was on hold for the three books. Althought I'm not a teenger, I liked the lovestory and each chapter had a &#34;cliffhanger&#34;, so you just had to read on.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey really gives a glimpse into how people lived during this period of time, especially the very wealthy.  The actors were suburb.  I can hardly wait until Season 4 comes out.  I would recommend this program to all adults.
B002QHH22O|5.0|Tracks 'Asian Hooker' and 'Turn Out The Lights' are worth the album price alone.  I don't know any other artists who just say it how it is through music the way that Steel Panther does.  Know a guy who will bone anything?  Well listen to 'Turn Out The Lights' and listen to that guy's life put to music.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It is great to stay in touch when you aren't at home but I seldom get wifi connection anywhere but home. but worth it if you don't want to go anywhere with out having all your multi media with you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books. They are full of action and romance. Every thing that I love. It's sad that they had to end.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app. It makes navagating the Bible so much easier and you can view so many versions if the language. becomes too complex. I highly reccimend it!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|great service, on time delivery, product is as described, product is in great condition. would definitely recommend this seller for purchases.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Different. Surprising twists. Thought provoking. Easy to read once you put your mind to it. Recommend to peopke who like books about psychopaths. Excellent character development.
B005XT1XT0|5.0|How this band isn't as big as many of the other rock bands is beyond me.  This album was both hilarious and full of great music.  I even use one of the tracks as my ringtone.  I cant think of any other artist or band that say the things they say.  I mean really, with tracks like 'Eatin' Ain't Cheatin' and 'I Love Drugs'.  Ha!  I'll also say that if you have heard these songs before and like them that you owe it to the artists to purchase the albums instead of using apps to find and download them for free.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|I got this for my son and myself because he got a telescope for his birthday in February. We have had a lot of fun reading this and waiting for the next phase so we could compare with the book.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Gives you a good look inside yourself. Great photography. I didn't put it all together until the end. Then I had an &#34;aha!&#34; moment. Great for repeat watching and see things you missed the first or second time. A great buy!

B00260HH3K|3.0|When I had first heard of a Dragon Ball live action film, I was stoked. \\"Finally, I get to see Goku blow s*** up and fight in hyper speed!\\" The teaser trailer alone had me hyped up! I was wondering how much work they were gonna put in the movie, how cool the effects were gonna be, how amazing the fights would look!.....then the movie came out and was bashed into the ground like cheap five dollar hooker on a bad day. This movie has been nitpicked, bashed, and had been utterly destroyed by everyone, from movie critics  to random fanboys and fangirls you find on YouTube, people have been complaining non stop: \\"They have white people playing as the Dragon Ball characters!\\" \\"Piccolo  is not green enough!\\" \\"It wasn't as fast as the anime!\\"<br /><br />But is it really that big of a train wreck? Is this movie worthy of putting it on the shelf of s*** movies in between `Street Fighter the Legend of Chun-Li' and `Batman and Robin'?<br /><br />First off, the cast. Why are people making a big deal about this? I mean sure, they could have gotten other actors besides Justin Chatwin for Goku or Jamie Chung for Chi Chi, but they got some pretty good actors to play the part. As for James Marsters, he did a fantastic job as Piccolo being the evil bastard he is (or if you want to get technical, the evil bastard he used to be). As for the race for the characters on Earth, there technically is no race on Earth besides Earthlings or humans. And no, just because Dragon Ball Z was made in Japan doesn't mean that the characters are Japanese as well. That's like saying every character made in the U.S. in Marvel comics are only Caucasian, it makes no sense. Chow Yun Fat did a great job as Master Roshi, it looked like he was haveing fun with it too what with the overacting he did, but that's what made me enjoy it more.<br /><br />Story now, is something to discuss about: Two thousand years ago, the demon Piccolo came to Earth, wreaking havoc with his minion Ozaru. Seven mystics created the Mafuba and thought they sealed him away for eternity. Piccolo breaks free and  begins to search for the seven Dragon Balls (each one has stars numbering between one and seven), killing anyone in his way. While that's happening, Goku is given the 4-Star Dragon Ball by his grandfather on his 18th birthday before he goes to high school. Returning home from a party hosted by his crush Chi Chi, Goku finds his home destroyed and his grandfather near death after Piccolo's failed attempt to acquire the Dragonball. Before Gohan dies, he tells Goku to seek out martial arts master Muten Roshi, who has another one of the Dragonballs. Along the way, Goku meets Bulma of the Capsule Corporation, and eventually also meets Yamcha. Together, they try to find all seven Dragon Balls before Piccolo finds them. Now that sounds like a regular plot now doesn't it? Because I really don't know what people are bitching about when it came to the plot. And no, I ain't giving away the ending, you have to watch the movie for that. It's a basic tale of a small band of heroes that meet up under different circumstances and decide to team up to defeat a villain that threatens the entire human race.<br /><br />Martial Arts Choreography is something to talk about. When you watch an episode of either Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, or Dragon Ball GT, you expect fast paced, lighting quick punches and kicks and waves upon waves of destructive energy being fired from a persons hand, eyes, and even the mouth. In Dragon Ball Evolution, the closest your gonna get to energy shooting is a ball, and the action scenes are not quick like in Dragon Ball, Z, or even GT. That doesn't mean that the fight scenes are horrible. The fight scenes are really good, you can probably compare them to the first Matrix movie when Neo practiced Kung Fu.<br /><br />The special affects are nothing special. They look like something out of an XBOX cutscene. No, not an XBOX 360 cutscene, an XBOX cutscene. They're not bad, but they could havedone so much better with the technology we had and still have what with the amount of CGI we have in movies now. Looks like something out of Windows movie maker. But since this movie is entirely a fantasy-scifi-action, I would let it slide for that reason.<br /><br />Being faithful to the source material is fairly tame. I mean yeah, they got the story, the characters, but if your able to get the references like how Gokus hoodie have the same color scene as his Gi in the manga and anime, his hair won't stay down despite putting gel on it, and even having the joke of Master Roshis first name actually being `Master'. If you're like me, you'll like the little things they had as references and will like the things they were able to keep in the movie. My one huge gripe with it are the ways they pronounce Gohans name \\"Go-han' and not \\"Go-Haun\\" and they chant the Kamehameha wrong, being \\"Kame. Hame. Ha.\\" instead of \\"Ka. Me. Ha. Me. Ha.\\"<br /><br />Do I recommend this? Yes. Sure, the movie has a s*** tone of nit picky moments in them like the way they pronounce the names and such, but there are a lot of things that are good about this film. Even as a movie by itself and not being based off of Dragon Ball Z or just Dragon Ball, it's really good. This movie is your standard popcorn film.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent character development.  Well worth watching.  Maggie Smith is particularly good.  The story centers around the three daughters with lots of tasty sub plots concerning the help at the manor.  Carson and Bates are particularly good.
B005IEGUDY|3.0|Some interesting history, particularly in the beginning of the novel, but after the first third the characters start to plod along a bit.  Maybe there's just not enough history in the Sarum area to get from Saxon times to the modern era.
0060555661|5.0|I'm glad with this purchase. The book arrived in perfect conditions. The purchase arrived on time. I'm glad with the service provided.

B008XCM18Q|5.0|I  really enjoyed watching the movie several times over a period of months. I decided I would probably enjoy the book.<br />The characters are so busy and involved in many intrigues at the same time and I found the characters much more fascinating<br />than in the movie.  This is just a great mystery, I would guess Ludlum's best!  You won't be able to put it down until you finish.

B0056CUZRA|5.0|Although this book is a long read I am already dreading finishing it!  So hence 5 stars. The story brings alive the historical events and how they affected peoples lives around the First World War. Many interesting facts intertwined in a fascinating story.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I found book two even more annoying then book 1. Anna continued to annoy me even more. Christian was still attractive and mysterious but I don't find any realness in the romance. I find her annoying and no different from any other virgin who is smitten by their first. I will not be buying the 3rd book for the same drawn out nonsense!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I would never have thought that I would enjoy a series about British aristocracy.  But this one sucked me in.  Worth watching.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Some say this book is sending the wrong message.  Also, that this book is dysfunctional.  The may be true but life is never perfect and the sooner we realize that the better.  If every book was the same story we would not have anything to read.  I do not agree it is a great story that I recommend.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have seen the Broadway production 3 times and I didn't think it could possibly get any better than that. But There are some things that a movie format can do that just can't be accomplished on a stage. Les Miz, the movie, is wonderful. And seeing it in BluRay (with a decent audio system) is great. So glad I got it!

B00338QENI|3.0|In general, I liked the author's respectful treatment of the Lacks family.  It would have been nice if Ms. Skloot had used quotation marks where indicated, especially when quoting from science journals and other written correspondence.  I also felt it was a bit &#34;jumpy&#34; when moving between past and present, but her use of the timeline at the beginning of each chapter was most helpful.

B005COO1X6|4.0|This was a well written short book. It held my interest just wish it was longer. I recommend it. Good read.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I wanted to see this film in theaters and never made it.  Then I bought the Best Buy Exclusive Steelbook Blu-Ray.  Next I waited until my fiance' and her teenage daughter were both at home and finally settled in to watch what I was sure would be a great film filled with wondrous musical numbers; man was I ever disappointed.  Granted my expectations were high.  Still; from the opening scene I was sure the film was going to deliver.  Ultimately I wound up going back and forth between hating the film and liking it.  There are some truly standout performances; most notable among them being Anne Hathaway who really bared her soul to deliver the song \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\"<br /><br />Sadly that was the one true highlight in an otherwise tedious and long-winded film.  It carries with it the particular frustration that a lot of the songs that follow sound just like that song.  Hugh Jackman can act and does so well in the film; however, his singing is a particular annoyance that is only surpassed by how truly awful Russell Crowe sings.  That is something you must know going in...every single line is sung in this film.  I know it is a musical; however, this decision was really poorly conceived.  The high production values insure the film looks good and yet the story makes leaps that are simply not explained.  Only those forgiving enough or familiar with the novel, the musical and even the earliest film version will make the connections and fill in the blanks.  All in all the film was a painful experience for me and I regretted this being my fiance's and her daughter's first exposure to Les Miserables.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Just like the first movie, the script kills any momentum the movie builds at any point.<br />Overall, it's worth renting, but not owning.<br />Casting was okay, and script/dialogue was lacking, but the special effects and action were well done...which is the whole reason I watched it.<br /><br />Worth $4, but not much more.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it is fun and good for tom girls and boy it is fun because they get very cool guys :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks is a great author.  I've read many of his books.  This is one of the best and very intriguing reading.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I need to only because I have to to post the review...<br /><br />Love this show, I haven't seen Jimmy play this well in many, many years...what a thrill. Jason does an excellent job at filling in for his father, but it isn't John and who could be? Collectively, they pull this show off in stellar form for their age and no, don't expect them to be what they were in the 70's or you will be disappointed. This may be the last time you'll see them play these songs together and this belongs in every Led Zeppelin fans collection.

B009HV2JT8|3.0|The book was wonderful.  The movie dragged along without the same force and wonderfully imaginative &#34;historic facts&#34;.  This made it hard to follow and only minimal explanation as to what the heck was going on was given to the audience.

B001IBIHQ4|3.0|How long has it been since there was a World War II movie covering the Pacific Campaign?  Why is this supremely signifigant front of the war continually ignored in favor of a prolific quantity of films portraying the war as it was in European and North African settings?    This is a fairly adequate depiction of the Pacific Campaign as seen from the view-point of three Marines who experienced it: Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie, and \\"Manilla John\\" Basilone. Leckie and Sledge both wrote extensively on their experiences, and their books are classics of combat history, still popular with Marines today.    This is an \\"adequate\\" rendering of the historical record, ...but with some grave reservations:    -Too much emphasis is placed on almost every aspect of the particular individual's experiences, EXCEPT the battles.  -The battle scenes that ARE included are rather \\"subdued\\", not unlike war-movies of the 1960s and earlier.  -In the Pacific Campaign, the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy were the opposing combatants: Japanese troops are BARELY and RARELY depicted in this mini-series!    Now, for anyone who knows a veteran of this war, especially a Marine Corps veteran, or anyone who has thoroughly read the history, ...this mini-series is going to be a disappointment to say the least. The Japanese were an adversary who went to great lengths to engage their opponents as close as possible. This is also true of the Marines. Much of the fighting was close-combat within the defensive fortifications of one side or the other, savage mayhem with blades, butt-stocks, entrenching-tools, and bare-hands. Quite simply, the combat was often too grusome and barbaric for Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks to stomach, ...so we get this quasi soap-opera rather than a war movie.    Tom Hanks made some unforgiveable remarks on the \\"racial\\" aspect of the war against Japan:  Apparently, the ONLY reason America warred against Japan, ...is because \\"they are a different race, and have a different culture\\",or some nonsense. To say that tommy missed the point (ENORMOUSLY) is beyond words.    Well, tommy, there WAS an ugly racial aspect to this war, ...and America DID NOT START IT!    As the grandson of a World War II Marine, and a Marine myself, I acknowledge that the Japanese fighting-man did fight bravely and fanatically. Of that, there is no doubt. However, the Empire of Japan DID NOT fight an honorable campaign (except in their own eyes). The TRUE record of brutality, slaughter, slavery, and genocide is STILL an open festering wound to every nation on the Pacific Rim that was over-run, conquered, and occupied by the Empire of Japan. Any American hostilities that went \\"too far\\" are quite miniscule when compared to Japan's treatment of civilians and captured Allied military-personnel. I myself have always admired the Japanese, and I have known several Japanese people as friends. But even my friends from Japan acknowledge that their nation fought an unjust campaign!    A REBUTTAL OF IDIOTS AND CENSORSHIP:  ...Some cowardly little PUNK keeps deleting my commentary in regard to the retarded, ill-informed comments made by yet another punk.    I'm going to keep on typing up my reply, no matter how many times un-Constitutional feces try to prevent me from excercizing my 1st. Amendment RIGHT to Freedom of Expression, ...especially when I am citing HISTORICAL FACT:    -The Allies bombed civilian areas in Japan, ...but Japan began the war by conducted unrestricted bombardment, with no distinction between military and civilians. In fact, they INTENTIONALLY killed mass numbers of civilians in every nation they invaded, especially China.     _Japan ALSO had a nuclear weapons program, and had EVERY INTENTION of using them just as soon as they could create them.     America beat both Japan and Germany in the race for an atomic bomb. The Japanese atomic bomb project was headed by physicists Yoshio Nishina and Busaku Arakatsu. A test or their prototype was scheduled for 12-Aug-1945,in th evicinity of Hamhung, Korea.     America had NO choice but to use their atomic bombs, ...the other option was an invasion of the Japan itself, in which the government was preparing the civilian population for suicidal resistance that would have resulted in astronomical casualties for both sides, but especially the Japanese civilian populace.    -With the exception of the bombing campaigns, which were RETALIATION for Japan's INTENTIONAL and gratuitous targeting of civilians from day one, Allied forces on the ground went to great effort to avoid civilian casulaties. This is particularly clear during the battle for Saipan.     The Japanese army however, repeatedly inflicted all manner of excessive slaughter on civilians. The siege and capture of Nanking comes to mind, where tens of thousands of Chinese people were machine-gunned en masse, bayoneted, or fired upon with heavy weapons. Enormous numbers of women were raped. This behavior occurred in every city over-run by Japanese forces, it was not unique to the battle of Nanking.    -The American citizens of Japanese ancestry who were interred in camps during World War 2 were well-fed, properly housed, and recieved medical care. Those citizens or their surviving descendants recieved monetary compensation and an apology from the United States government, eventually.     Prisoners of the Japanese did not fare nearly so well: Allied P.O.W.s were subjected to death-marches, mass execution or summary execution, torture, and slave-labor. Those are considered war-crimes, by the way. Allied prisoners, when liberated, were found starving to death, diseased, and generally emaciated. Many of those prisoners died shortly after liberation. Civilian populations under Japanese rule were exploited and abused in this manner on a much larger scale.    -The Japanes government established a system of brothels for their military personnel. These facilities were staffed by women from the occupied nations under Japanese rule. Thousandsof women and girls were forcibly taken from their homelands and used as sex-slaves. Korean women appear to have been exploited in this system more than all other nationalities.    -Then we have Unit 731, headed by Colonel Shiro Ishi. This organization operated a facility in Manchuria that conducted experiments in biological and chemical warfare. Thousands of civilians and Allied P.O.W.s were exposed to biological and chemical agents. The test subjects were examined by scientists and doctors, ...who subjected the victims to VIVISECTION in order to examined the effects. This is the dissection of LIVING, CONCSIOUS test-subjects, ...NO ANESTHETIC applied. This was done to men, women, and children.     This is HISTORICAL FACT. Some of the victims of these atrocities are still alive, all over East Asia. The government of Japan has NEVER acknowledged these deeds, to this very day. America, on the other hand, ...isn't allowed to forget when it had a fine for an overdue library book.    The younger generations of Japanese citizens are very different people than their grandfathers who served in the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan. But they are not informed of any of these things. All they are taught about World War 2, ...is that they were bombed by America.     Thats all leftists in America know about World War 2 as well, ...yet they put on such an ostentatious and sanctimonious airs of being so much more \\"informed\\". Put down the bong and pick up a book.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|\\"Gladiator\\" is loosely based on a Hispano-Roman general from the Roman province of Hispania (Russell Crowe as Maximus). Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia - modern Galicia in NW Spain). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the vicarius for the Hispaniae (the Celtic provinces). The name Hispania was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. The modern name Spain derives from Hispania.

B005MLOOJA|4.0|I watched the complete first series, now I'm completing my second series, and I like the characters and story line.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I think prior reviewers did a much better job than I could ever accomplish.  But I would add that \\"Where are We Now\\" is very melancholy but also soaring when it takes the turn toward the end, and the melody is just amazingly haunting.  And there's nothing wrong with growing up, really, or growing old, which is what the song is about.  If rock can't accommodate melancholy and the passage life, it's time to chuck rock and roll for something else, but that wouldn't be pretty, would it.  The video for the song reminds me somewhat of the Cash video for \\"Hurt.\\"  Cash's had lots of clips, but Bowie's mainly has objects, but the theme is the same:  the accumulation of very particular memories that somehow become the man.  Not shabby, in either case.<br /><br />And the song noted for it's potential Leonard Cohen connection...listen.  It's a reverse version of the H-song, which is (for those of you not out here in LA) banned from some  folk clubs -- Cohen's song, not Bowie's -- for it's overuse at gigs.  The twist on the verse melody is straight out of Cohen, and I doubt Bowie would not have intended it so.<br /><br />All told, this is a terrific record from a man who has given us many terrific records.  It deserves its high stature on various charts and much more.  I recommend it to believer and infidel alike.  Grow wise, my friends.  Grow wise.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|“Alatriste” is a refreshing view of Spaniards and Spain during the 17th century.  Hollywood has not done justice to Spaniards and Spanish history since “El Cid” was released back in 1961 (and somewhat with “Gladiator” which was loosely based on a Hispano-Roman general from the Roman province of Hispania). Although “Alatriste” is distributed by 20th Century Fox abroad (fortunately with English subtitles), the movie was suspiciously not released and marketed to the U.S. public. This movie is devoid of the prolific negative stereotypical caricatures of Spaniards fostered by Hollywood and the mass media in the United States. Moreover, the movie is not plagued with Hollywood’s contemporary cookie-cutter production style and fixation on infantile fluff (i.e., exaggerated special effects, gratuitous violence, and pseudo-pornography). The story is solid and entertaining; however, it may be difficult to follow since most people in the United States have been deprived of factual Spanish history, but rather inculcated with Hispanophobia in its place. I suggest watching the movie a few times to get a better understanding.<br /><br />The sword duels are realistic and are not influenced by Oriental martial arts sword fighting like so many movies regurgitated by Hollywood.  I highly recommend “Alatriste” to anyone interested in medieval European history or authentic European sword fighting.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Watching this from the beginning on Syfy, I was hooked from the first episode. The story is engaging, the action is very well done, the characters are always interesting and the plot twists are unexpected. Don't miss this.

B0093ST02E|2.0|This movie couldn't seem to decide where it wanted to go or how it wanted to get there. It may have decided along the way at one point, but presented entirely unbelievable scenes between people that could not even allow me to suspend my disbelief. Which is said because I heard good things...
B00003CWNR|5.0|John Irving became my favorite author as soon as I read &#34;The World According To Garp&#34; I happened to run across<br />a top 100 books of all time article, I believe in the NY Times. Before I read it, I knew Garp would be somewhere on<br />the list, and sure enough there it was at #50. I've read many of his books and love them all. He can describe a<br />scene that will have you rolling in laughter or feeling the pain that a character is going through.<br /><br />Cider House Rules is an American classic. The film is the best book to screen adaptation I have ever seen<br />and the all star stellar cast are amazing in their roles. Michael Caine, Charlize Theron, Toby Maguire, Delroy Lindo,<br />Paul Rudd and Erykah Badu are incredible in these roles, and create an all time favorite film you'll want to see over and over.

B000XKZQ74|1.0|Wasn't able to see the movie as the app kept giving an error. Just wasted my money on this. Never buying movies from Amazon again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little girl downloaded this game and the whole family lives playing it. It teaches kids the responsibility it takes to have a pet and the everyday care they take.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|So we got this manly gray one. Which is very manly. Did I mention it was manly?<br />it is working fine.
1603425381|5.0|I think just the first chapter alone, counting stitches when creating borders, great tips about colors and borders, etc and attention to the corners.... paid for this book!  I love everything about this book, the colorful photography, the directions both printed and charted and tons of patterns which can be combined to create tons more border ideas and patterns.  It truly is a crochet border bible.<br /><br />I love that the photos show the straight edges along with the corner as turned.  There are no finished products illustrated, more a caveat for beginners that might expect that.  But the photos shown are so easily imagined around a completed afghan, cloth, edging, etc that it doesn't take a thing from this wonderful book!  I love the size too,  6&#34;x8.5&#34; easy to throw into my take-along needlework bag.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The movie seemed to be truer to what happened than the other movie about the same subject. It lets us know the great amount of work over many years went into being an end to ubl. All the actors did a very good job.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I am so glad that I got this!<br />Pros: It extends a good 2 feet, swivels pretty much any way you could want, pushes out of the way fairly easy, perfect height. Very sturdy. Holds a 20 inch monitor with ease.<br /><br />Cons: We had some problems figuring out how it moved to begin with, it only took us about 10 min. to figure it out. The middle push adjustment is hard to push.<br /><br />Over all for the price it is great it does everything that I need. I would definitely recommend it!
B00AA8Q0FQ|2.0|The first one I received kept getting stuck, so I sent it back and the second one came very quickly and it also kept sticking thoughout the movie.  I tried playing it in different players and is still the same.  Other movies play through without sticking so it has to be the quality of dvd.  I just didnt bother trying to get a third one.
1936608898|5.0|I was totally skeptical about this 30 day thing and the book. BUT, I got the book. Kept an open mind and read it. Jammed full of useful, scientific information that explains why I've struggled to lose weight for so long. I have been a vegetarian for close to 25 years and have eaten a lot more carbs in proportion to fat and protein. The book was so convincing that I decided to add in some more animal protein into my diet. My first bite of chicken was tough after all these years but if it's responsibly sourced and raised, AND I can maintain a weight I want without having to starve, it's worth it to me. No one said it was going to be easy. You aren't supposed to weigh yourself in the first 30 days but I have been. I've lost 9.5 pounds in 10 days. Previously, I'd lose .5 pound in 2 weeks and I was always hungry. I haven't been hungry at all on this program. I guess you really won't know unless you try it. For me, this is easy to follow, doesn't require a ton of cooking and stuff like &#34;The Plan&#34; and it works. I'm a believer for sure.
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I can't stop thinking about this movie.  It was so incredibly sad, and I wish it could have ended differently, but maybe that is why I can't stop thinking about it.  I love the deep bond and love between the characters.  I just feel so sad that Dexter is left without the love of his life and best friend that new him so well.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Right from the start, Amelie is a movie that makes you chuckle and warms your heart. Every shot and scene draws you into a world of soft gentleness. The performances are all played with a perfect sense of irony, and Audrey Toutou is adorable. This is a movie that makes you smile, and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy long after the final credits.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It's not a cartoon one, but virtual effects, similar to Tin Tin. Voices are great and the &#34;tourist&#34; boy is simply hilarious.  Excellent film to enjoy with the family or by yourself.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This really is a great app for the KF, but only if you have few contacts and very not that much incoming email. I've been trying to get a decent app for email on my KF for the past year. I have a corporate email account at my office, and don't want to import any settings to Yahoo. I probably get not more than 10 email a day that aren't spam. (Last Friday I hit an all-time high of 492 spam email even with filters, but I've had the email address since 1995 so I guess it's to be expected.) Anyway, I installed Yahoo! Mail app onto my KF, and it was a breeze until I tried to add contacts. I have a contact list with Yahoo online, but I couldn't get it to import it. And, I cannot find a tab or folder or anything else in the app for adding contacts. (I don't even understand how it found my 9 really important contacts, but it did. However, when two contacts have the same first letter, nothing happens.) So, I've spent over an hour just trying to get a dozen contacts added, and to no avail. Otherwise, it's a great app for the KF. It might even be better on a phone, but I don't email from my phone. I have a keypad disability, and my phone does know the difference when I say \\"Bob\\" or \\"Susquehanna.\\"<br /><br />So, why 4 stars? Because it acts like all other email programs, and other than the contact list, it's extremely fast and \\"smooth.\\" Not a glitch yet. I sent an email from my Kindle to a friend in New Jersey - pardon me for being impressed with today's technology, but I remember dialup very well! - and I received a reply all within 4 minutes. And I had added a relatively large photo.<br /><br />Oh, and the app will search on the Kindle for my \\"photo album\\" (aka \\"Galley\\" under apps), and it will either attach a large photo or insert a small one. In a way, it smoother than Eudora Pro, my all time favorite email program that Adobe stopped supporting in 2006.<br /><br />If anybody knows how to add a contact list (and I can't import from my PC because the email program is 18 years old and Yahoo doesn't \\"recognize\\" it), I'd appreciate knowing.<br /><br />(P.S. I don't understand the review that said that the app couldn't handle or was it \\"display\\" enough email. How could an app on a 3\\" phone or a 7\\" Kindle [etc] display more than 10 if that? From what I've seen, app or online, Yahoo can handle any amount of email.)old and Yahoo doesn't \\"recognize\\" it), I'd appreciate knowing.<br /><br />(P.S.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|First let me say, I love the Lord of The ring movies. This movie although was beautiful visually did not keep my attention for 2 hrs and 50 mins. I am glad I saved to view on rental and not pay $15.00 at the movie theater. It was good for a rainy day at home. And then there was the singing, I kid you not. I thought is was slow and not exciting at all. To its credit it did have some funny one liners. I read the reviews, thought that as a good indication of how the movie rated. No offense to the the people who gave this movie a great rating but you all were way off base. I was generous by giving it 3 stars. I don't plan on adding to my DVD collection unless by husband wants it.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|Green Day's newest album Tre Is the best out of !Uno Dos Tre! The Album's best songs are \\"Missing You\\" \\"X-Kid\\" \\"Little Boy Named Train\\" \\"Dirty Rotten B******s\\" \\"99 Revolutions\\" and \\"The Forgotten\\".<br />  !Uno Dos Tre! are not as similar to American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown as they are to Dookie and some of the older stuff. But with every new album that comes out the music gets better and better! My favorite album is 21st Century Breakdown and then Tre. If i were you I would invest the money in GreenDays newest album. I loved it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I had a huge disappointment with this film. Surely Daniel Day-Lewis performance is great, same as Tommy Lee Jones. However, I guess I expected an awesome film and its just an okay one.  There is a lot missing from the story to have a clear idea of what Lincoln was. Some of the dialogue is very intense and good, but overall I am a bit disappointed with it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is one of the cleanest and functional apps I've seen. It meets my needs without doubt. I have recommended this app to friends. I use it on my kindle fire HD without any issues.
1606865617|3.0|May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month. The days are long and humid. The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dustgreen trees. Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst. Dissolute bluebottles hum vacuously in the fruity air. Then they stun themselves against clear windowpanes and die, fatly baffled in the sun.<br /><br />  The nights are clear, but suffused with sloth and sullen expectation.<br /><br />That's the opening of Roy's beautiful, obsessive book.  I say obsessive because instead of telling a story in a straightforward way, with a conventional dramatic structure which might have a setback one-third of the way through, a massive setback two-thirds of the way, and a climax near the end, this story bares its secrets by the one-quarter mark, and has by then already begun its endless circling around the same people's same problems.<br /><br />I am an unfair reviewer. I didn't finish the book. I read the first 80 pages, a few dozen pages out of the middle, and the ending. But I find no gaps in the story that I would have to read the rest of the novel to wrap up, nothing to motivate me to read the remainder.<br /><br />The episode with the Orangedrink Lemondrink wasn't merely a gratuitious sex scene; it was damaging and misleading. In a story about what made Estha become so messed-up, you can't throw in an extraneous episode of sexual abuse. The difference between a story and real life is that in a story, you can point to one thing that caused another thing. Whether that's good or bad is a separate argument. Roy wasn't, I think, trying to subvert that traditional structure by making the cause of Estha's silence ambiguous. She just wanted to add another little bit of bleakness and selfishness and didn't notice that it muddied up the central narrative of her story.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that it won the Booker prize, because the literary establishment believes, as two creative writing instructors have insisted to me, that \\"it doesn't matter what you say, only how you say it.\\" Everything is said beautifully.  The content is even significant and ambitious! But if there's anything in the book other than relentless misery and cruelty, I didn't get to that part.  More importantly:  Why throw thousands of years of experience on how to keep listeners interested out the window?<br /><br />Maybe I have Western preferences, and that's how they write books in India?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun.  I wish there were more competitions to play, and the energy levels didn't take so long to go back up, but it's a great game for when you're bored.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I am so happy with this purchase.  All of the songs on the album are excellent and have me singing along with them in the car.  I think he is a very talented artist and I am glad that he has such a great album out there.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love this app its super awesome and really addictive!  My whole family loves it &amp; also think its cool!
B000S88JTS|5.0|I like this one a little better than ll, a little lighter hearted, but both are great movies, over and over.
0525478817|5.0|Loved it.  You will enjoy this read and really hits home and makes you think.  Well worth the read!! quick read
B0071FBARY|2.0|This was ehh.  There was one song that liked from the Fray and thought I would go ahead and buy the whole album.  I was disappointed.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Amazon charged me for this movie but it has yet to show up in my Video library.  Clicking the email they sent me that said it would launch the movie doesn't.  Usually, my experience with Amazon is great, but this has not been.  [amended review]  I never did get to watch the movie on my PC, but the Amazon rep I dealt with was courteous and dealt with the problem in a prompt and satisfactory manner.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the movie (I saw it at the theater and loved it) but I gotta take off one star just for disappointment.  Overall, Amazon did a good job, though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with John Green and you love each character I cried but this is definitely one of my New favorite books
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read to my children editing the more gruesome parts. Buy still able to follow along and discussed the topics together
B0099G7KDQ|2.0|I am not happy with this purchase at all.  I have really been into this type of music but this album left me high and dry.  Not happy at all with the songs.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This app is absolutely awful.  It barely works at all.  I deleted it and choose another free facebook app with only one F on the logo and it works great.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun app. Fun to play and pass time. Interesting plot line. Need to review to get sequel. Stopped halfway through game.
0143116738|2.0|Sir Ken Robinson presents a work that is well structured and looks at many angles of The Element (usually better knows as The Zone; where your talent & ability meets passion). He describes The Element, tells us how creativity plays a role, looks at the role of the people that surround us, goes into positive psychology (attitude is important), encourages us to look for The Element even when we are older as healthy life expectancy continues to rise, and is honest about the fact that pursuing The Element will not necessarily lead to more money in your pocket.  The countless examples of people that found their Element makes this a much longer read than the content requires.<br /><br />Attention: If you are looking for guidance or support to find you personal Element,  like I did, then you will be disappointed. The book offers nothing of that kind, just hightens your awareness of what you are looking for and the factors playing into it.<br /><br />In any case, watch his TED talk!
B009LGO88E|5.0|The XL Circle Pad Pro works perfectly. I mainly got it for MonsterHunter3Ultimate and it's just absolutely perfect for it.
0345803485|5.0|I received a brand new book promptly and with no defect. My fiancé loved this book. I think I got great service.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|For anyone who's read Slammed or Point of Retreat, you already know that Colleen Hoover can pretty much do no wrong.  There are very few authors that I will read each and every book they write no questions asked.  Colleen definitely falls into this category.<br /><br />I wrote my original review back in December when I first read Hopeless.  Part of me wants to leave it as it is.  I wrote it while still high off the fumes that only Colleen can emit.  The other part wants me to elaborate on just why I think this book is so amazing.<br /><br />This story became very personal for me.  I'm not sure why though as I can't relate to the plot.  It's not like this has happened to me or anyone I know.  I think maybe it was the underlying story of hope and ultimately forgiveness.<br /><br />HOPELESS:  feeling or causing despair about something.<br /><br />This is not a pretty story tied up in a bow.  It's clouded and dark and you'll know while reading it that its going to take you somewhere you don't want to go.  But you will because you won't be able to stop yourself.  I can only describe this story as something you just have to experience.  You have to let it all go and let yourself feel it.  You have to breathe it.  Let it fully encompass you.<br /><br />Sky is an amazing character.  She's honest to a fault.  I cringed at some of the things she did.  I was even embarrassed for her at times.  She's also really funny and I smiled and laughed a lot.  The world in which she's raised is interesting to say the least and her adaptation to the real world was scary.<br /><br />  \\"My lack of access to the real world has been replaced completely by books, and it can't be healthy to live in a land of happily ever afters.\\"<br /><br />Then there's Dean Holder.  OMG he will forever be in my top five favorite male heroes.  It's hard for me to come up with the words for Holder.  Here's a list of words that come to mind:<br /><br />Perfect  -  Intelligent  -  Kind<br />Sweet  -  Sexy  -  Loving<br />Gorgeous  -  Funny  -  Compassionate<br /><br />I hung on every word that came out of his mouth.  I knew he was special, I could feel it through the pages.  I can only hope that my daughters one day find a Holder of their own.  Every girl deserves a Holder in their life.<br /><br />  \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />The scenes between Sky and Holder were.....literary magic.....<br /><br />  \\"You're attracted to me?\\"  \\"Oh, God,\\" I groan.  \\"That's the last thing you need for your ego.\\"  \\"That's probably true,\\" he laughs.  \\"Better hurry up and insult me before my ego gets as big as yours.\\"  \\"You need a hair cut,\\" I blurt out.  \\"Really bad.  It gets in your eyes and you squint and you're constantly moving it out of the way like you're Justin Bieber and it's really distracting.\\"<br /><br />I have NEVER felt so connected to a couple as I did Sky and Holder.  I felt like I was intruding at times that's how amazing and descriptive their scenes were.  There was no way you couldn't feel every single emotion.  It just poured off the pages.  The intimacy shared...I felt like a voyeur (not in a creepy way lol).  There's a particular scene in the book that may normally have had me fanning myself.  Instead, I sat there crying.  In all the reading I've done over the last year, I have yet to come across another scene like that.  It was pure, and raw, and beautiful.  It was perfect.  It was exactly what it should have been.<br /><br />I felt as if Hopeless brought me full circle.  It started out hopeless, but it ended with nothing but HOPE<br /><br />HOPE:  a feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing to happen.<br /><br />This story played a pretty big part in my first tattoo.  I've waited a long time to get one and I wanted it to be perfect.  I sort of knew what I wanted but it wasn't until I read Hopeless that I figured it out.  \\"There is always hope\\" will forever be on my arm.<br /><br />I loved Sky and Holder.  I loved Hopeless.  You will too.<br /><br />Thank you Colleen Hoover.il I read Hopeless that I figured it out.  \\"There is always hope\\" will forever be on my arm.<br /><br />I loved Sky and Holder.  I loved Hopeless.  You will too.<br /><br />Thank you Colleen Hoover.

B009GQ57ES|4.0|When Amazon offered the MP3 version of the CD for $3.99, My daughter asked for it, so I bought it for her. It's now a part of my CD collection. The CD is a good one, if you like rap music.

B000HWZ5WE|5.0|I looked for this for a long time. I remember the album came out in the 80's and my brother loved it.<br />For some reason Robert Plants voice stills echoes in 2013. And I got it! It still is awesome after all this years.

B00B0NDF26|4.0|I always thought that Tegan and Sara would be too &#34;young&#34; for me to listen too, so when Amazon offered the MP3 version of the album for $1.99 I bought it. Glad I did. The music is upbeat and although I've only listened to the CD once, so far, I have put it into my Ipod's music rotation.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another smash hit by Colleen Hoover.  No-one writes heartache like Colleen.  Sky has been sheltered all her life.  Finally, her senior year she is going to public school.  When she meets Dean Holder she can tell he is a bad boy.  The problem is she is drawn to him.<br />Holder cannot stay away from Sky.  There is something familiar about her and he must find out why.  Their story is of love and heartache.  This story is amazing!  I didn't stop reading until I finished the entire book.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|There are several great messages about life in this movie.  Would highly recommend!  The graphics in this production are wonderfully fantastic.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love every thing about this show. The costumes, the actors, the history, and the drama. I can't wait till next season!!!!
B00BGIC3T6|4.0|Fairly funny movie, gets to be a little long, could have been edited better in the middle of the movie but still worth the watch/buy
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was recommended this book back this summer by my brother's girlfriend at the time whom I barely knew, but it turns out that she pegged my &#34;type&#34; when it comes to books.<br /><br />The Night Circus comes shrouded in mystery at first, with elegance, beauty, and excitement tantalizing you to read further. Morgenstern writes of two magicians' bet's effects on the lives of those directly and indirectly in its path. Celia and Marco dance together throughout the novel, tying together seemingly unrelated entities into one grand circus in black and white.<br /><br />The novel includes foreshadowing symbolism and other elements an AP student can easily identify to determine the outcome without ruining the story. The ending comes as little surprise while its mechanisms are both from left field and sitting right in front of the reader the entire time.<br /><br />This fantastic read will enchant, excite, entertain, and challenge thoughts. I read it while flying across the US and vacationing, which is recommended as this book is extremely difficult to put down after part I. Morgenstern crafts highly believable magic and beauty as long as one is willing to believe.

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Really enjoyed this DVD.  It was quite different from the other two.  Made us think about how the series all came into being!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This appears to be excellent and with my first attempts at converting B&W negs from the fifties where amazing. So too were the memories from 55 year ago.<br /><br />It is simple to set up and quickly produced clear albeit small, positive images on the inbuilt screen. One then copies them onto the SD card for uploading later. It works like an old film strip projector and one just rolls the film through and each frame appears for selection with no delay.<br /><br />The quality when viewed on an iPad was fine although no doubt a more expensive 'scanner' would be sharper. However for the price it is great and it gives instant results so a real find!
B0054X3FQO|2.0|If the author wasn't a model I dont think this would have done all that well. Its quite light weight and blah. I think it would ne a nice read for anyone under 14.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This was a nice surprise. I just couldn't see what all the hype was until I watch this.  Who would of thought a 55 year old would enjoy a movie about a silly teddy bear.  If you want a good laugh and and you don't mind a bit of the raunchy side this is a good movie to rent.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|After listening to this album, I understand how Stevie resurrected the blues virtually single handedly. Full of soul, power and feeling. Buy it!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is simply the best alarm clock app I've found. It's so easy to use. I especially like that I can have more than one alarm set at a time. The background music feature lets you choose music or white noise to fall asleep by, you can even set a timer for how long the background noise will play. The different clock faces to chose from are nice, but you can adjust the brightness of the screen, which is a plus if having to much light in the room keeps you awake.<br />I would recommend this alarm clock app to anyone.
B002VCR03A|4.0|4.5/5 stars really.<br /><br />I loved this - haven't a good epic fantasy in a long time.<br /><br />Katsa is a fantastic heroine and I really could relate to her, even her Grace and her distaste for the violence so inherently a part of her.<br /><br />The writing is rich with description but doesn't bog down the story, which didn't feel nearly long enough.<br /><br />Prince Greening is a wonderful hero and leading man. The chemistry between Katsa and the prince is palpable and I loved their slow burning romance. Without giving away spoilers - I also loved how their story ended and their imperfections only made them more endearing.<br /><br />I had two problems with the book which prevented it from being a 5 star read.<br /><br />1) There are 7 kingdoms and yet they all speak the same language? I just don't find this plausible. Look at Europe and the diversity of language and culture. I wanted more cultural and ethnic diversity here and just didn't get it.<br /><br />2) The prince's nickname is Po. I just couldn't read that name without picturing an obese purple teletubby. Entirely my own fault for this association but it irritated me throughout the book.<br /><br />I've grown really attached to Katsa - that the other books aren't really about her is incredibly disappointing. Not sure I'll be reading the rest of the trilogy but I loved this book!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I want to live in Downton Abbey ... for a season. Brittish nobility and commoners alike are so realistic, one wants to get to know them all. i was disappointed in the conclusion of season three and frankly saddened to the point I wasn't sure I wanted to invest the time and tears in another go... but then I realized the depictions were artistic slices of real life and that it is often sad and messy.  Now I can wait to see how they overcome and carry on next season.  Bravo!
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Well written with a creative story line. The personalities of all the characters are well developed. This is the second book I've read by David Baldacci. He's a good writer. I'm glad to have found him.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just figured out to post my own photos! Two months, but worth it and now to decide which pictures I want to post. Some will have recipes with them but not sure which ones with out setting up a website to go that far with it, so the experiment is in motion. Not in a rush. Happy to post!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game really gets you hooked trying to get more prizes and getting the special coins .  Sometimes it tests your patience waiting for coins to accumulate.  Overall I am hooked and it is a good game if you are not in the mood to do a lot of thinking .
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is so far fetched. The characters are unrealistic and clingy. There's very little character development. I do not plan on reading the rest of the series.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The movie was awesome! I didn't have very high expectations, but even if I had this movie would've met them. I didn't know Karl Urban was Dredd; he did a good job of being Dredd. The storyline was good too.<br /><br />However, I gave it four stars due to a streaming issue. The issue was that the playback was interrupted by periodical blackouts, yet the sound remained constant. In other words, the screen would go black and come back on. I will say that I streamed it through my computer, and I'm not sure if that had something to do with it. I probably shouldn't include that stuff in my score, but whatever. It's a good movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was not quite as good as the previous two seasons but sine I would rate those as FANTASTIC...off the charts...Season 3 still gets 5 stars.
B000UU4NE4|5.0|My son is 6 and loves spiderman we have this on DVD but he wantes it on our kindles so I purchased the SD version rather than the HD and the quality is still absolutely stunning on my new Kindle which is the best one they offer ;) my son loved sitting there watching this with his ear buds in. He was in his own little world for an hour in a half just enjoying that he could have his own time with spiderman ♥ I would recommend the SD to anyone I've only purchased HD for every other movie but they take up a lot of space after this purchase I'll continue to buy SD because the quality is great.  Who doesn't love Spider Man lol
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|...from the PC version.  There are less challenges than the PC version.<br /><br />I do not like the continual requests for a review in the paid version, and so give it four stars for what it has.<br /><br />Beautiful graphics, lots of information on older civilizations, lovely narration.<br /><br />Perfect travel lite version.<br /><br />I hope they make more levels available in an update, because folks are missing out.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Season 2 is just as good as the first and makes me incredibly excite for the 3rd season. The characters are compelling, the story keeps your attention. This is a top 3-5 series on TV.
0765325950|5.0|Been waiting a long time for this one. It does not disappoint. Fantastic build up, and the suspense kept humming along. Definitely more exciting than book 1!<br /><br />The book does a fantastic job of making the reader understand - it's the end. of. the. farking. world. Way more weight to it than your typical movie trope. People - main characters, not redshirts - die. It's all out apocalyptic war, and I loved it.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Ok it's fun game but you can't DO anything unless you have gems. The only way to get gems is to buy them and I spent $10 an got hardly anything. If you want to spend hundreds of dollars playing a fun game then go ahead but fun games to me cost less than $10; especially when advertised as free.<br /> E
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Just the right amount of romance and drama!! Fell in love with the characters and didn't want it to end.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks always writes quality novels; ones we can relate to and I think that I have read all of them but the newest one and will certainly put it on my Kindle. Kathy
B000LRVLPK|5.0|I was looking for a black-dial chronograph watch that wasn't too bulky on a woman's wrist and found this watch after literally going through hundreds of watches. I love this watch, and I plan to buy a black leather band for it and wear it interchangeably with the brown and black band. My order arrived very fast and in great condition. The only beef I have with this order is that now that I've bought the watch, it has dropped in price. I guess that's how it goes...
B00007LTIA|4.0|I am amazed at the degree of differing opinions from YES fans over this album. It really is this simple: If you like long atmospheric songs that take you on a musical journey, you'll love this. If you want shorter more compact YES songs, listen to FARGILE. That's it really. End of review. Have a nice day.
B0006HBZXS|1.0|The real star of this stupid movie is a small pocket knife which makes wonders (spears, big wooden traps,shelters, the bear's skin turned into a coat...etc.). Maybe it has magic powers in the hands of a bilionaire A.Hopkins?! This time David Mamet and the director, both, thought that the viewers are total morons and they can \\"sell\\" the stuff. Well, judging from very many applauding feedbacks they really succeeded (a vast majority of moviegoers fall easily for pathetic acting and pathetic dialogues being followed by grand pathetic music on the background of a severe northen nature landscape- it \\"shows\\" that the movie is \\"really serious and good\\"). Doesn't Anthony Hopkins feel ashamed for such a piece of junk?!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Everyone should see this movie.  First saw it in 7th grade English Class.  Many of life's lessons are taught in that movie.  Don't make them like that any more.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I'm just over half way through the book but I think it's very good so far.<br />Can't wait to see what happened in the next.
0060581808|4.0|THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOOD presents a little girl, her older sister, and their parents, who survive the wild living happily in a little log house in the woods of Wisconsin. Kids 8 years and older should enjoy this book since Laura Wilder creates a plethora of engaging images of this family.  Ma cook's, churn's butter, and cleans.  Pa hunt's and protects his family from wolves and bears, and engages his girls with adventurous games and stories. Wilder gives nifty information of how maple sugar is made, and how venison is preserved for the winter. Wilder creates cozy indoor and outdoor settings that unfold the joys and perils of living in the woods. This family must hunt, barter, and preserve food for the winter, but they enjoy warm fires, and Pa's music and stories. City kids will experience the thrills of living in the woods and surviving the seasons. Garth Williams' cover art presents the rustic appeal of this humble family before turning a page. William's art remain vivid and compatible with Wilder's language and tone. Wilder's premise seems to present family survival and love. However, her premise becomes a bit hypocritical towards the end of this book when Pa becomes conscious of the brutality of killing animals--if killing animals facilitates human survival, then Pa should continue his habitual killing. Nonetheless, young readers will enjoy this intriguing story: THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOOD
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I found this album, and it's really awesome. They have a pretty unique sound, and all the songs are good. Definitely a worthwhile purchase. Yay for finding a new band to get into!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This app was great!! It was hard to put my kindle down! The graphics were really good and the storyline really keeps you interested! It was well worth the money!
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|This movie seemed like a rich person's guess at what it's like to struggle.  The wife is being really bitchy and difficult because she doesn't want to be old, while the husband is struggling with money issues, specifically that his company is going bankrupt.  Wanna know how they could solve the finances?  They can downsize their current living situation.  He doesn't want to tell her that they are in financial distress, and she apparently runs her own business too but has no clue what their finances are like...sure.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />Two and a half hours go by until finally she finds out that they need to sell the house, and so they agree to sell the house.  Wow.  Really dramatic.  They have to sell their gorgeous house and downsize to a probably much smaller but still gorgeous house.  I'm sure they will still own too.  So that's what rich people think struggling is: Buying a smaller house.  Rough.<br /><br />Paul Rudd was great as always, but even he couldn't carry the huge acting disabilities of Apatow's kids.  They should have done this movie with Paul Rudd as someone else with a different wife and kids so we wouldn't have to have endured Apatow's kids as actual characters with scenes of their own.<br /><br />Also, if you want to keep the same characters from Knocked Up, then maybe you should reference the other characters in Knocked Up, specifically why is there a huge (catered) birthday party with all of Pete's family and friends but yet his sister-in-law and shrooming friend aren't there?  Lame.<br /><br />Overall, the whole movie was a huge dud.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|One of my favorite films, Pixar or otherwise.  Touching, funny, creative and a pleasure to watch.  My favorite films are always those in which the characters exceed their own expectations and Carl, Russell and Dug all have to dig deep to save each other and Kevin!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Extremely descriptive, totally plausible, fantastic set-up and background for the plot. Must be willing to have an open mind about spirituality and religion, for what else is there to fall back on in extreme survival situations. The zoological bits were copious  and  necessary and it was graphically thrilling where it needed to be. Something for everyone!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have been searching for a new book ,so I decided to take a look at 50 shades of grey. When I tell you that the reviews I have just read entertained me with so many laughs. I have decided that I'll save my money on the purchase of this book. Thank you all! Lol
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Got killed in reviews but I enjoyed it. Just the visuals are amazing and it's well worth adding to the library
1878424319|5.0|Easy reading and truly inspirational. Bought a copy for my daughter and palnning to purchase some more for my friends.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis cannot be human. This whole film is captivating; like you are in the room, on the battlefield, alive in 1865 Washington. Just watch it already.
B005ZUR724|4.0|its pretty kewl. I like that its alotnlike world of warcraft. its pretty kewl. its pretty cool. its pretty cool.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|Barbara and I were both a lot younger when this movie was released. The years have gone by and I've picked  up a lot of wrinkles and aches and pains (can't speak for Barbara on that) but I still love Funny Girl. Often humorous, occasionally heart-tugging, always fabulously entertaining. The HD digital remaster is outstanding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun, one of the finest games I have had to play on in a long time. I love how you compeer against your friends.
0765348276|5.0|I was alerted to this novel by NPR's list of the Top 100 Science Fiction Novels of all time (nominated and voted upon by listeners). \\"Old Man's War\\" is not only the best science fiction novel I've read in the last 10 years, it's one of the finest SF novels I've ever read. A pure joy from the first to the last page. Thank you, John Scalzi, you've won a new fan.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I was really excited to order this CD because I had heard 2 GREAT songs and figured it was all going to be like that.<br />Nope.<br />A lot of rap.  A lot of LONG and repetitive verses.  Disappointing.<br />Getting used to some of the songs but skip through a few, too.  I was hoping for more but I don't regret buying it and would probably buy his next one.  He's great, so I'll give him a pass but still didn't love it!
B00993G41S|4.0|I must have not been paying attention when Wanda was released, otherwise I would not be seeing it for the first time just now. Imagine The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight meet The Marx Brothers meet The Three Stooges meet Benny Hill. Chuckles throughout with a good dose of belly laughs followed by me exclaiming, &#34;I can't believe they actually did that.&#34; A rolicking good time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's the most amazing zombie series in history, you're just waiting to see what happens next & can't wait to see what happens next week it's awesome!
B00571F26Y|5.0|educational, informative, a must read especially if you have diabetes II or prediabetes.An easy lifestyle change which can save yoour life.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I agree with others that this movie is overrated.  Katherine Bigelow must have powerful friends in high places to get a second Oscar nomination for yet another movie that didn't deserve the honor.  Both the Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty are put together in such an uninteresting way, that I've found myself websurfing in the middle of both of them.<br /><br />Which is sad, because the subject matter of both movies had such great potential.<br /><br />I won't be wasting any more money on any more of her movies regardless of how many nominations she gets in the future.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|If you have a kindle fire hd you need this to know your battery charge easily without going through the menu.
B004SBX112|2.0|I'm always happy to pay for an app when the developers deserve it and Angry Birds is one of thee games. However the latest &quot;update&quot; was nothing more than an extra feature that must be paid for. Since I already paid for this app, why do I need to pay again? Guess I wont be buying anymore Angry Birds apps if they want to be greedy.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Good, new approach to the fantasy novel.  A little boring in places, but it's well worth it for the long-term character development.  A lot of the story revolves around magical training, so it's a little like Harry Potter, but without the childish aspects.  I'm glad I bought it.
0765325950|5.0|I probably should have given this review four stars (or maybe even three), but I went with five just to counteract all the whiners who are giving it one star because they had to wait an extra month for the eBook version, or because the series didn't wrap up exactly the way they wanted it to.<br /><br />As the ending of a fourteen volume (or fifteen, if you count the New Spring prequel) fantasy series, it wrapped up most of the story lines nicely.  There were a lot of returning characters (and even an entire nation) from previous volumes that I didn't remember because it's been so long since I've read those books, but for the most part I was able to follow the story.  I was (and I think most other readers were) expecting a lot more in the battle between Rand and the Dark One, but really, what else could have been added to that?<br /><br />I'm kind of amused by the people who are complaining that there were too many battle scenes in this book.  The whole series has been leading up to something called the Last Battle - the final confrontation between good and evil, and you complain that the last book has too much battling in it?  What were you expecting?<br /><br />All in all, I liked the ending and I thought Brandon Sanderson did a fine job of picking up this epic fantasy universe and finishing the story.  Truth be told, I think I liked his writing style a little more than Robert Jordan's.  I doubt I'll ever read the entire series again though, and if I had known many years ago when a co-worker loaned me the first two books that it would turn into a bloated, 12,000+ page series, I probably wouldn't have ever started reading it.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Lots of tracks I haven't heard before..Same for Fire/Fury.  Too bad &#34;Voodoo Chile&#34; keeps popping up, but there's no more going to come from this Master of the Guitar.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books kept you turning the page! I feel these are for teenagers to adult or mature readers. The themes are excellent. It definitely keeps you interested and thinking all at the same time.
B0027GGL6W|5.0|It was my first time watching the movie it didn't seem interesting at first but finally I watched it and I loved it I can watch it over and over again!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is an excellent way to speed up all your phone typing. Its text prediction is eerily good and it makes it much easier to write long (or short) messages on your phone keypad.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Great app,but the connection is weak at times and I'm cool on the ads. All in all this is the best one I've downloaded so far.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|You can judge this book/movie by it's cover. It works if you don't have high expectations. Ensemble cast works very well together though. Downey is amazing as usual.
B00AXVH8KQ|4.0|Foxygen's second release for Jagjaguwar is a brand of neo-psychedelia not too different from that of MGMT's Congratulations; a retro-rock affair firmly planted on a production that does its best to resemble a late sixties/early seventies sound. Foxygen, however, do not allow contemporary elements to penetrate their time capsule, and if it wasn't because we've heard that heavily reverbed, delayed low-fi vocal aesthetic from similar revivalists, one would be none the wiser to tell the time difference.<br /><br />Foxygen focuses less on the elongated jams of vintage psychedelic acts and more on pop songcraft, praising melody over virtuosity and sounding on the pop spectrum of psychedelia (The Zombies, Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour etc). That's not to say they don't rock though, since the influence of acts like The Velvet Underground & Bob Dylan pervades all throughout the record.<br /><br />Having said all that, We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors Of Peace & Magic has personality; it can be mellow, trippy and even humorously tongue-in-cheek, packed with lyrical deliveries full of cross-references, self parodying madness and personal reflections, everything you could expect from a great pop record.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is super fun I have a lot of fun playing this game. I really like taking care of the horses!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Will not work with Kindle Fire. Epson Support claimes it will not work with Kindle Fire. Why do you require so many words? Ridiculous. Discourages making a review.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Love the digital format-never have to look for the DVD that the kids lost!  We've watched multiple times already..plus we did not have to wait for shipping either.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice app/game to kill time with. Fun fun fun time killer just son' loose track of time with this game. Adictive
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great series of books. I'm not much of a reader but these books I couldn't put down. I'm hoping that there will be another series written.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|Awesome really awesome i loved the first book as well  so i knew this one had to be a good one too
0307887448|5.0|I love this book. You won't want to put it down for anything. It's very well written, especially being the first novel ever for this author. Any geek would absolutely love it. Anyone not a geek would too. I think it calls out to the geek inside all of us. :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Nice app to have. In my area, weather changes so quickly. Really a nice way to keep up on the forecast.
0525952926|2.0|Liked [via listening] to \\"The Fall of Giants.\\"  Up to now I have always enjoyed anything John Lee has narrated and thought the first installment was better written than usual for this author.<br /><br />\\"Winter of the World\\" is silly; the writing style is pure Young Adolescent, mixing bodice-ripping sexualized romantic and otherwise encounters with the author's trademark dwelling on torture and sadism.<br /><br />John Lee - whom I've always thought could do a terrific job narrating the IRS tax code - was disappointing at best.  He interchanged his few male American voices so that telling them apart was often difficult; the irritating New Yawky-Brooklyn one he used for the primary female character was grating, annoying, and fit the character not at all.  But all that could have been forgiven - I am such a John Lee fan - had the book been better written.<br /><br />\\"Winter of the World\\" dumbs down WWII; it is repetitious with the author constantly having to summarize plot points, is choked with wooden and improbable characters; the main characters oh so very conveniently find themselves in all the right historical places - just coincidence after coincidence after...<br /><br />WWII - pre/during/the years after - was a lenghty stretch of history - far longer than the number of its years.  Follett wasn't bothered by that, however, making leaps and jumps and hops and skips of time/events when and wherever he got bored or tired.  But never too pooped not to focus on kissing [he does go on and on re kissing] and other sexual romps through those years.  Follett has his own history of enjoying writing about torture/sadism and does not skip a beat here.<br /><br />Not even a good beach read.  My only consolation was that I got this via my library and just spent gas $.

B0083GQKQG|3.0|This film is based on a book that never left my closet but the title always caught my curiosity. The problem with the film is it is very serious and this may work for some while for others it won't. There is not much hope in the film but there are slight delightful drama bits here and then if you would bother to notice.<br /><br />Kevin is the worst kid in the world who doesnt listen to his mother and hates everything about her from early birth. He doesn't have a learning disability and is never able to comprehend why he hates her so much. She is a helpless mother lost between being loving and strict, but she can't help herself. She lets go off everything in life for him while the father plays neutral.<br /><br />What makes it watchable is very emphatic direction and screenplay.<br />What makes it unwatchable is how much scenes will make you cringe.<br /><br />Eventually the film could leave you in either despair or feeling like something has been gained, it left me more so with the former feeling.<br /><br />This one is not to be forgotten because it is so different. Like a character study. Overall, I would still be curious about the book in my closet had I not read this. I commend the directors for doing such a tough film.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|The best cross platform rss reader I've found so far to replace gReader. They seem to be stepping up to make transition as seemless as possible- the one thing that is missing is tag support on their android apps (and multiple tag recognition for the PC add-on, but that is for a different forum). Fix that,and its 5= that I would pay a fair market price for.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|This is a great addition to my ST collection. Glad they were able to 'convert' to HD for this series.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Loads very slowly, does not move between pages and almost never loads notifications properly. EXTREMELY slow in all areas. Not a program I would recommend for Kindle Fire users.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Used the SD To Ipad worked fine. USB to Ipad is hit or miss b/c USB digital protocol is not standard across all cameras since the camera firmware access the memory card then sends to the iDevice. since the iDevice is connected directly to SD card, it will read the files. (Unless maybe the camera used makes a really odd directory structure that the iDevice can't decode)

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|excellent game for adult hunters. I was so tired of downloading games only to find out I would be looking for lollipops.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I CAN'T FIND THE WORDS THAT WOULD DO THIS CD JUSTICE! This is my first exposure to Rihanna (pardon the play on words), but she is beyond magnificent! If you need to be picked up out of your doldrums, to be put in a better mood, this is the CD to do it. Every cut is worth listening to over and over again, which I have done!
B004S5FW1U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - can't wait to see the movie. The characters are great and would recommend reading this book.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|The movie is light-hearted and fun, with some good humor (some not appropriate for children). It also has some good music, but I was ultimately disappointed with the music aspect.
031617615X|5.0|Stephenie Meyer is a very talented author. I've real all the twilight sagas and they are just as you expect them to be: drama, love, action, everything in one.<br />I'm really looking forward to reading The Host.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I say unusual since it is out of my comfort zone. I am branching out, and am so glad I did! This CD is fantastic. You don't have to be young to enjoy Jack White. This is a perfect intro for one who is not familiar with his music! Just a fun listen...
B005O65Y3S|5.0|This case made by Fujifilm is made from high grade leather and, is lined with a soft velour fabric. It fits both X10's and, X20's. It form fits perfectly on the camera. It has no screw for the tripod mount but, the case is quickly and, easily removable. It also has a magnetic clasp that makes it a breeze to open. Just a great light weight leather case!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|We watched this on our family movie night with our daughters ages 10 and 13, without having read any reviews or having any idea of what the movie is about.  Our 10 year old thought it was scary, but huddled close to her dad and made it through the whole thing.  The movie and plot is quite engaging; it's hard to know what is &#34;real&#34; and what is imagined -- until the end.  It was too metaphorical for our kids to understand -- and that is probably a good thing, given what the main character had to do to survive.  It was pretty thought-provoking -- after-the-fact -- for the adults who watched.  Our kids watched the whole thing, but they really didn't enjoy it very much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the most addicting games ever. Don't try it unless you want your Saturday night with your boyfriend to consist of the two of you playing the game on separate smart devices. How romantic. [Insert sarcasm] :)
B009P5S11G|5.0|If you like Rihanna or don't, buy this CD! It gets your mind, body and spirit moving. Isn't that what music is all about! Every fiber of your being will love this! After you play it, and a happy feeling emerges, give me a smile!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie, great movie for the whole family to watch. Good movie for those who like games in general. Must see.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|This is an older movie, but it is one that I really like. I have looked for this movie at several locations; most could order it for the price of buying a newer movie. I found this movie on Amazon for five dollars! The shipping cost added a couple of dollars more, but it was still cheaper than all the other places I looked at. As always,  the shipping is fast. This movie was delivered within four days.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is one of the best city games I have ever played. It is so fun. It's really fast and cool I like to play it all the time.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This was unexpectedly one of Justin's best efforts. Unexpected because it deviated from his usual style, which is not a negative by any means! Mirrors, was exceptional, as was the video! This project will be enjoyed by all ages. A great non-caloric gift to bring when visiting, and it will last much longer!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like this game but I have had to remove this game form my kindle fire 4 times already. But I will say this, it is more challenging than the first temple run. now I cant even get to bed before 10 because I am playing temple run two.
B00APAENUI|5.0|I stumbled into this series via the Safehold series. I don't think the books are individually superstars but the series is what makes the books good. This one was a bit tight with the timeline and seemed rushed. I did like that it went beyond the normal Mantie-ness of the other books.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book goes a bit further than other books I have read on introversion and extroversion, exploring how introverts look like extroverts sometimes when doing what they live.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I think this was the best book of the trilogy.  I read through it much faster than the other two.  I just couldn't put it down.
B004G600A4|3.0|Rapunzel is a good movie and I like it, but it's just doesn't have alot of elements that really stood out for me or makes me<br />want to fall in love and watch it again.<br />The comedy was a bit over the top.Now don't get me wrong...Rapunzel is a very likeable character. She's really cute in the likeness of Ariel<br />and even displays that same curiosity behavior like her. She can do amazing things with her hair. I just find that<br />the movie itself is terribly overhyped. Do I think it's as good as the 90s films (the renaissance era)?<br />Nope...it's FAR from it.<br />It doesn't even come close to the lion king, beauty and the beast, hunchback, or aladdin. Aladdin and TLK were<br />waaay more funnier than this movie plus the songs from the older ones were much more iconic and memorable.<br />There's nothing truly memorable in this one. I would say it's a tad bit better than sleeping beauty.<br />I thought the scenes with Mother Gothel and the ending were the best ones in the film and<br />why I would give it at least 3 stars. I don't completely hate this film but I don't completely<br />love it either. I want to pinpoint the main problems of what I found in this film and what I felt was really lacking:<br /><br />HUMOR: The movie relies too much on comedy in that I felt it was overdone. At times, it felt more like Shrek. It's like they showcased that in every<br />scene whereas the older Disney films kept the comedy to a minimum and focused more on the serious parts.<br />Examples: The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, The Lion King, and Beauty And The Beast. I think the comedy fit in more<br />with Aladdin and Hercules because they didn't dealt with darker themes.  I found movies like Aladdin and<br />The Lion King and maybe even Hercules to be far more funnier than this film.<br />I felt that some of the scenes came off as<br />cheesy and lame. I think the only funny moment for me was when Rapunzel kept hitting Flynn Ryder with the pan.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: I actually thought Mother Gothel was the best one in the film and she far outshines the characters in the movie.<br />I just think the rest of the characters don't have nearly the wit and charisma like the ones in the older movies.<br />Rapunzel is okay. I think the fact that she's artistic and sheltered reminded me more of myself and Quasimodo.<br />Both of their parental figures would often tell them how they wouldn't fit in with society and that society<br />would be a threat to them. I think Mandy Moore gave a good job providing the voice for Rapunzel.<br />But if I have to compare her to other Disney princesses, I choose Belle, Jasmine, Ariel, and Tiana over her.<br /> Pascal? Okay..but he doesn't even compare to Aladdin's Abu or Ariel's Sebastian.<br />They definitely had more character and fondness about them. Flynn?? Not really my favorite at all. Did not<br />care for him at all. I didn't like how Disney changed his character from<br />a prince to some lame thief named Flynn Ryder. One of the reasons why I choose Barbie's version of Rapunzel<br />over this! They at least still stick with the originals instead of trying to sound so hip and cool like what<br />Disney is doing.<br /> Prince Stefan sounds waaaay more appealing than some stupid Flynn Ryder.<br /> He has no charm or charisma like the other male leads in the past.<br /> I much prefer Aladdin, the genie, mufasa, simba, and even my boo Quasimodo over him!!! He just doesn't have any special qualities<br />that make me want to fall in love with him. Maximus? I like him...he was funny at times. I have to take notice<br />that aside from the mental abuse and using Rapunzel for her selfish gain, I couldn't take Mother Gothel that<br />seriously as a villain like with Frollo or The Evil Step Queen. There were times where she seems likeable when<br />she shows affection to Rapunzel just like any real, loving mother would.<br /><br />MUSIC: \\"I See The Light\\" and \\"Mother Knows Best\\" were the ones that only stood out for me. Most of the songs<br />were just modern pop songs that didn't feel classic or magical. Neither catchy or memorable. They could have<br />taken a cue from the Hunchback of Notre Dame songs. The Princess and The Frog songs have more a classy, jazzy feeling and<br />fit in more with the movie rather than relying on humor.<br /><br />SETTING: Felt too modernized for a historical setting. In fact, it feels like watching Shrek. What I liked<br />from the older films was that they showed more culture. Like The Beauty and The Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame showed<br />French culture. The Lion King showed African culture and wildlife. Pocahontas showed Native American culture.<br />Aladdin showed the Arabic/Middle Eastern culture. The songs of the Little Mermaid reflect the Caribbean culture.<br />The Princess and The Frog showed New Orleans/Jazz culture. What culture does Tangled have that we could learn<br />and reflect on? I really couldn't help how Tangled seem to be reminiscent of Sleeping Beauty like when Rapunzel<br />was kidnapped and was raised by a witch just for 18 years...just like how Princess Aurora was kidnapped and raised<br />by fairies for 16 years.t for me.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is the best dictionary app I've seen so far:easy to use, does not take long to download,does not need Internet connection,and the audio that goes with almost every word will certainly come in handy.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I was never into 007 movies until Daniel Craig played the part of James Bond!  Had to own this one!
B00BF123WG|3.0|could hear it well enough; needed subtitles.<br /><br />where is the hero in all this?  even she was disappointed in the result.  she gave her life to<br />kill Bin Laden.  seemed like it was not enough.<br /><br />killing seldom is.  not nearly as good as the reputation for this movie.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Of course I loved Game of Thrones, Season 2! There is much to love as the saga continues and the power struggles march on.  I love this series because there is so much humanity in it. These are charactors we care about. The series continues with evil King Joffrey still on the throne (for how long, we wonder?) with Robb Stark as King in the North, Theon Greyjoy returning to the Iron Islands for back-up, Jon Snow caught in the wilds beyond the Wall and Dani's dragons nearly starved... Great cinematography, great acting, great sets and costumes, great story. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy and imaginative story telling. Can hardly wait for Season 3!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a different version that I've played on my computer but the different versions are interesting and fun to play!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|A bit gorey. Interesting read tho. Couldn't figure out what happened right up until the end.  I didn't like the chapters skipping from one person to the next. I guess that's one way to keep it suspenseful.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|this series does not respect its audience.  it demands so little, much less than LA Law.  or other shows.  every episode turns on the<br />discovery of a detail, usually a piece of paper, that for some reason (found loose on the courtroom floor, or a misplaced document in a defendents file, etc) made by the the Good Wife.  she makes a discovery, and wins the case.  always the same.<br /><br />boring.  disappointing.  is year two better?  did they hire  some good writers?  the heroine is engaging and interesting.  she is not given much to do.  and everyone is a stereotype.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Dan Brown's book is an interesting read, but it requires more suspension of disbelief than I could muster. Terrible, horrible things happen to and around three people during one long night. Rather than take a single moment to pause and recuperate they wax philosophical. Far too contrived for my tastes.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Cant believe that a writer has such amazing imaginations, it really what goes on sometimes and just shows you how people if they just let go can enjoy a sexy life.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game was pretty, fun and engaging. Would have given it 5 stars had it not crashed at one point. The only way I could play again was to delete and reinstall the game, after which there were no further problems. Kind of a minor bummer - had to start over. Since the game was so much fun I only subtracted one star.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|A very lonesome and painful book taken in today's view of the world.  The cheers abuse and physical violence-a product of its time.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I first saw this story on CNN about these men. I love WWII and I just have the highest admiration for these veterans. What this German pilot did for one of our own will make you proud. An easy kill. Would have gotten Franz Stigler his Knights Cross. He not only spared the B-17 when he intercepted it, but he escorted him through one of the worst flak emplacements in Germany. Read and find out why. Just an outstanding story.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|This book is exciting as the story never has a dull moment, it takes you up as well as keeps it exciting.
B0091REZMW|4.0|For me it was too hard to do. I didn't care for looking for an item with a spot light application.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|All the Master's works at your finger tips.  You can flip from one category to the next.  Brilliantly illustrated! To me it is a must for any serious reader of life in Europe at the time.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I watched on NPT when he performed all these songs. It was Awsome! Enjoy! I am so glad to had found it here on Amazon.com.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I just got this app and it ran very well but I couldn't enjoy it to the full extent because of the background music. Well... I shouldn't say music, more like random noise.
B000S9HVZU|4.0|Over all, I like the novel. But the movie is genius.<br /><br />-The sense of color in the novel seems gray and earth-toned, but in the movie there's this contrast between the character's grayness and the vibrancy of the flower.<br />-The construction in the movie flows better than in the novel, but it can be considered as an advantage of the medium itself. (But I still wish the author can give me that same wave of moving between characters like they understand each other)<br />-I do like the part of Mrs.Brown better in the book than the movie, because it feels more natural and real Mrs.Brown won't say something like \\"what are you looking at?!\\"<br />-The last thing, according to the novel, Julia shouldn't be that pretty like in the movie.
0800132009|5.0|It was received and I enjoyed the movie even after seeing it several time over the years on TCM with Robert Osborne.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, as all the other books written by Mitch Albom!  Not your ordinary stories, stories that give you something to think about long after you have finished reading his books!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|The Picture of Dorian Grey is in my opinion one of Oscar Wilde's masterpieces.<br /><br />The book is quite thought provoking and explores several concepts of good and bad and the role of our conscious in keeping a wilder human habit in line.<br /><br />A wonderful read with great writing from Wilde, though a certain long paragraph in the middle leaned towards being rather boring as it dragged on and on in descriptions that are completely unrelated to the book nor add anything substantial, even as background. You could skip the whole paragraph an wont lose a thing.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend at least one read of this book. It left me thinking about its themes days after I finished it.
B008N9AASC|1.0|I didn't get it. Yes, great photos of places etc, but how does it string together. I think maybe better seen in a cinema, not DVD at home.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|It is fun but it use way way way to much battery. Normally my kindle takes 4 hours to go from 5 percent to 100 but with this game it took 8 hours to go from 5 to 25 percent with this game.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Adobe writes singularly inelegant code. Bloated code slows processing and causes apps or whole system to crash. Foxit Reader is a good alternative for some content. Doesn't replace adobe for all content.  Wish developers would stop using adobe.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Excellent action movie with host of one liner's and developing characters. Shows excellent resprect for former military that ion the movie save the world.

B00BWJARHO|4.0|As a fan of the first LOTR trilogy, Skyrim, and various other role playing/adventure based games, I absolutely fell in love with The Hobbit. It was a little long at an almost 3 hour run time (I suggest you make sure you have nothing to do before watching) but overall the movie was great! Not having read the books I felt I was able to follow along easily and now I am very anxious for the next two Hobbit movies to be released. Next step - read all the books in the series!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey since it was in beta and even back then it was better than anything else available. Since then it's worked out numerous kinks and is truly a lifesaver for me. I have tried everything else, and always end up returning to SwiftKey.<br /><br />K.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Scott writes well, and the stories are good but I found I had read an awful lot of this book in magazines and online articles before. The recipes look good but I haven't tried them, and we still don't really know what happened in his head to get him up and moving at Badwater... perhaps its not something that goes into words. He described his successes and failures which makes this a much better sport memoir than the average
B006LSZECO|1.0|Couldn't put it down!<br />What an amazing story. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Great read.<br />Loved it.<br />You should read this book.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A wonderful tale of triumph over nature and spiritual tenacity!  I'm so glad I read this book before watching the movie.  Sometimes the language and accents are hard to follow on screen.  Very fulfilling read!
034580404X|5.0|This series is amazing. I have enjoyed reading the first book and I am sure I will love the other two just as much.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The cast is very comfortable with each other and it makes the movie flow. Its fun to see some of the older action stars, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Arnold, ect. Fun to watch.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Breathtaking views of the Grand Canyon as seen from the Colorado River. The additional documentary on its making is very interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't read this book right away after reading the first.  I can only assume that I was too addicted to other books as well to immediately dive into Catching Fire right after The Hunger Games.  Why did I wait?  I ask myself now.  Catching Fire was fantastic!  Do to who I work for and my true opinion of the true meaning behind this book and the one before it...I can't express it openly online.  But know this...Suzanne Collins...I know exactly what you are trying to get across to the readers and I thank you for being so brave expressing it in such a fabulous way.  Keep up the good fight and keep writing excellent stories like this one.  I have Mockingjay in the other room waiting for me to start tonight.  I'm not waiting this time.  Folks...if you want an excellent politically charged read...than this is the book series for you.  Open you hearts and minds and see how the story relates to what's going on in America today.  I've said too much...time to start the final book...Mockingjay.
B006CHML4I|4.0|Good looking watch. I use it for casual wearing. Nothing special just a basic good watch that seems to work well in the short time I have been using the watch. Good price for a Seiko.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game reminds me a lot of mario. The graphics are really good and the levels are fun to play. Its great for all ages. I cant wait to get the second one
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I have read many reviews of people being disappointed in this book, as they were expecting really creepy and scary.  First, I can't say any book has ever creeped me out or scared me.  That's what movies are for.  With that said, do not go into reading this book expecting to be scared out of your wits.  Yes, the cover may look a bit eerie,  but if you read what the book is actually about, you should have an idea that it's more of a mystery.  Once you start reading, the cover - and all the photos in the book - really make sense and fit the story perfectly.  I had bought this book for my kindle app so long ago that I forgot what it was about when I started reading it.  So I just started reading, not knowing at all what this book was about.  For me, not knowing what it was about, it almost seemed like a memoir in the beginning.  I thought that's where this was going until things start getting VERY PECULIAR.  It becomes apparent this is definitely not a memoir, but a mystery.  I thought the story was very creative and interesting and I definitely didn't expect what happened to happen when Jacob goes searching for the chlidren's home.  Can't wait for book 2.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|The film tells a real story of history and the efforts of one man to save as many people as he could.  The development of the characters and portrayal of various incidents was very well conceived and accomplished.  An excellent film!
B0040I09RM|5.0|The first season introduces the majority of the main characters and lays down a great plot with plenty of room to evolve as the story progresses.<br /><br />I've been watching sons since the first episode and it never fails to leave me wanting to see what happens next week. Great actors, great story development and lots of action. It always leaves me guessing and wanting more.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am a faithful weather channel watcher and this app is great. Not only can you get your weather but u can check on it anywhere. I always use t his app before i travel. It also has neat videos and tips. I would definitely recommend thus app
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Even in an ever more crowded field, Suzanne Collins trilogy stands out.  It works well throughout the series, and like most fantasy makes the unbelievable, believable.<br />Their is a nice balance between the level of violence and the forward movement of the stories.  She (Collins) doesn't linger so the violence doesn't come off as gratuitous, but rather accentuates the peaks and valleys in a way that pushes the reader forward towards her goals throughout (yes, and across) each book.<br /><br />Nicely done, Ms. Collins.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I love Depeche Mode.  They are my #1 go to music.  There is nothing like the synth sound and striking beats and humable lyrics of DM.<br /><br />This album left me cold.  The music sounds like Depeche Mode, the lyrics sound like Depeche Mode but there is nothing here that will stick with you.  I can't think of a single song that grabbed me, made me want to learn the lyrics, and hum it for a week straight.<br /><br />The album is slow and the lyrics remind me of a sad depressing rainy day.  80's goth music?  Where is the bounce?  Where are the fast beats?  Where are the lyrics that stick with you?<br /><br />Alas, there is none of that.  If you want to sit in a dark room and stew on your own failings then this is the album to listen to.<br /><br />I want happy and bouncey and this had nothing for me.  Where is the song that you want to get up and dance to?  I am very sad about this album.  The only positive is there are 12 other albums to listen to.<br /><br />Let's put it this way, if they release another greatest hits album, there will not be a single Delta Machine song on it.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This is easily one of the best shows I've seen in years. I bought this for my parents and they're now hooked. Check it out if you haven't already.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|A perfectly good story is buried in hundreds of pages of tangents.  I have never skimmed so much and missed so little.
B00A3AUGEW|1.0|Simplistic lyrics, derivative music (prodigal son of Mumford?). I should have listened to the samples better before I wasted my money.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This is a good read about how one person faced his impending death. With dignity and courage! A sickness in the family? Read this for one perspective.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great movie, good acting cast, really enjoyed it; Recommend to anyone to view, especially young people, that's history.  Lincoln was a good man.
B004XQX4K0|5.0|This book is from 2011 year, but is actual for current technologies in 2013. Great description of language itself and current frontend technologies.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|As I've flown through both games in only a couple weeks, I hope there's more versions to come! So challenging fun and addicting!
0307593525|4.0|There's a lot of good material found in this book.<br />Although it can be too much reading if you're really not too interested in the subject.<br /><br />Good to have on hand to refer to.  It's more like a textbook/cookbook.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This clock works fantastically on my Kindle Fire!  Love it!  I am recommending it to all my friends and coworkers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in about 24 hours it was so addicting I couldn't put it down even to sleep!  Highly recommended!!!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Many of the critics have commented that the brutality of the film does not serve a purpose and that if anyone suffered like this we would feel the same empathy and sympathy.  I am grateful that they would feel sympathy and have trouble watching anyone suffer like this, but the point of the film is to help the modern person to remove their sanitized version of Jesus death and impress upon us all that \\"GOD\\" suffered in \\"OUR\\" place. I realize many viewers of this film may not have faith that Jesus was GOD in the flesh, but for the Christian, Jesus experienced this for me and you and that we are responsible for his suffering and Death.  By our individual rejection of GOD we inflicted this on Jesus. It isn't anti Roman or anti Jew, it is about all of Humanities need to be saved from death. The death Jesus experienced was physically horrible but even greater was his Mental anguish caused by the Father turning away from him. Jesus experienced separation from the Father and all the mental anguish that is associated with that. Jesus experienced HELL for us so we don't have to.<br /><br />the Bible says,\\"for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God,\\" Romans 3:23 and that the wages of sin is death Romans 6:23 and that while we were yet sinners Christ Died for us. \\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\\" Romans 5:8.<br /><br />For me personally who has accepted that Jesus is the Christ, this movie's graphic nature started me in a way that awakened my sensibility of what Jesus did for me.  How much does God value me that he first made me and then in my rebellion he suffered for me. This is the message of Christianity and the Bible.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Console quality graphics, challenging environments and you get to eat people. What could be better? Well, not having to earn an inordinate number of gems in order to buy useful items, like course maps and larger sharks. I know the company's gotta make money. I'd rather pay a bit up front, and have the powerups be reasonably priced.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Not so much like space invaders but it is good fun with the same idea of SI. Power ups are nice and the first person they power up is crazy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so different of any other book he has written, it shows his dark and mysterious side. I think is the best book so far from him, I didn't want it to end.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I got a chuckle here and there, but the movie has a very &#34;The Office&#34; sort of feel to it which I do not have an appreciation for. The acting also seems forced in much of the movie and unrealistic. I suppose if you enjoy that type of comedy you will like this movie. I did not.
B0020M99LC|3.0|I ordered this dvd because I had just seen SkyFall and loved it.  Didn't love Casino Royale as much (too violent)  but Daniel Craig is a great 007 and the acting by all was very good.
B004YXE438|3.0|I found it easy and challenging enough to hold my interest. This game probably won't get used much unless the grandchildren like it.
1586217194|5.0|Blink is an excellent book about the \\"other\\" kind of intuition--the non-magical kind. See The ESP Enigma for a great deal more info on what we more commonly think of as intuition--often referred to in the literature as an aspect of (or outcome of) non-local consciousness.
B001V7WC1Q|5.0|Great acting ! I love this movie!!!See it with you girl.I wish there was a second part to this movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is like a cooler version of temple run it is the best game I have downloaded and would highly recommend it to a friend.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I prefer more challenging games with levels of triumph throughout to make you want to move on to the next level.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Excellent delivery and the music is great. I sure like the ability to sownload my purchases in MP3 format so I can play on a flashdrive in my car.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I had alarm that displayed on the ceiling but this app puts that in the 80s. I love waking up to my songs and not the caffeinated dj
1476733953|5.0|I read the first story out of this series for free from Amazon. It was ok but nothing that made me interested in devoting additional hours to the subject. Later a coworker invited me to read along with his book club and initially I declined but eventually I decided to give it a go. I'm extremely glad I did!<br /><br />This book offers an interesting looking on a future that at one time seemed almost inevitable. It examines how the power structures stay in place and the prices paid. It examines the cost to the entire community of people who work against the system as well, pitting the cost of compliance against the cost of revolution. It makes for a great story.<br /><br />I think my favorite moments of this book all qualify as spoilers so I will simply say that this book has my favorite kind of twist in it. I love when I see a revelation that I realize had been foreshadowed pages before and  I simply missed the correlation, a connection that seems obvious in hindsight.<br /><br />I would strongly recommned this book to anyone. You may not be impressed by the first story but it's worth reading for the background. You will be impressed by the mid-point! It's a worthwhile if occasionally brutal read.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|This is a great movie. I was surprised at how good it was. it got here on time and in good condition.
B000W93CHC|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book to help me pass the time while my husband was having an extended hospital stay.<br />After reading &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; I found this book to be very similar in the events and plots of the first book.<br />I did enjoy both books and decided to rent the mini series - Pillars of the Earth was pretty good and followed the book fairly well.  However, I would not recommend World Without End mini series because so much of the story was changed, it was disappointing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game! It is soo much like sim city! I've always wanted to play that game but i couldn't get it. Now i can play this game!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|i must say, i'm really surprised that this has gotten so many good reviews. in my opinion it was long and drawn out, they never would just simply turn on the lights so there are many scenes of near darkness. it just didn't grab me..perhaps it would be different if i watched it late at night. no, i don't think that it would. :(

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is just soooooooo cute and the graphics are OUTSTANDING! It's my runaway favorite Match 3 game of all time. You match 3 to win a stone with which to rebuild the city of the Hods, little Hobbit-y, elven, tropical, magical beings who live beneath the Tree of Life and which a demon destroyed.<br /><br />The match threes are so cute - an assortment of jewels, perfume bottles, lobsters, leaves, scrolls, fish, coins, plumes, oysters and more random things. But, they are rendered so brightly and are so cute, you just sort of can't wait to see the next batch.<br /><br />After you clear a board, you get a building stone. There are 100 levels with increasing levels of difficulty and power-ups. You can save your stones and build everything at the end, or use the stone you win at the end of each level to build a section of the tiny building...the Hods take your stone and hammer away and they're just darling.<br /><br />There are ALWAYS moves, you never get the \\"there are no more moves left\\" message, LOVE!!!!<br /><br />The graphics just glow and the little Hod huts and Tree of Life look like Russian iconography lit so beautifully and the rendering of the details like vines and the Hods themselves is so detailed...really a work of art and imagination.<br /><br />I only wish that you could disable the help; I like to look at things and on some of the more complicated boards, it takes awhile to look at everything and see what will move what. I would sooooooooo prefer a HINT button that you can activate at will like on the Fish HO games...still, this is the prettiest, most interesting and most fun Match 3 out there. Love it!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This is a cute little game for fans of Big Kahuna Reef. Line up three or more of the same jewel and they blow up. The rules are just different enough to confuse my old brain, which is why it only has three stars.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I agree with everyone, it's a shame it cost so much money for things in game. Still fun though..my husband and I have this on both our Kindles and we are hopelessly addicted! Sometimes we find ourselves just sitting there watching our  city work...we may have a problem..heh. If you ever liked Sim City, you'll like this. Z
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a fun little game that is free on Kindle Fire. It's good to play while you are waiting in the doctors office or waiting in line.
B003S897UK|3.0|I was excited when I saw this...covers of some of my favorite songs...King Crimson's 21st Century Schizoid Man, Humble Pie's 30 Days in the Hole and Led Zepplin's Dazed and Confused, along with Willie Dixon's I Can't Quit You Babe (most famously covered by Led Zepplin).  The covers are good, the rest of the album is mostly disappointing.<br /><br />This is the 1999 New Years Eve concert (hence the album name).<br /><br />THE SOUND QUALITY IS FAIR.  The music is distorted in parts and the mix can be poor.  Overall, it lacks dynamic range.  For the most part, the sound quality is good enough but there are some horrible sections (overall the sound quality is not as good as the sound quality for the sections of With a Little Help from Our Friends that Gov't Mule did not originally release because of sound quality issues).  I believe this was a radio broadcast and maybe that is the source for this CD release (instead of the original masters.<br /><br />This starts out with 6 songs from the first 3 Gov't Mule studio albums.  Usually, I prefer live music over the studio versions, but in this case I think the studio versions are much better.  They do stretch out the songs a little more here, but I don't think they add that much to them.<br /><br />The best thing on the album is track 7 where they are just jamming until the New Year's Eve countdown.<br /><br />After the countdown, they play a very nice 21st Century Schizoid Man and Dazed and Confused.  The original artists versions are better, but these are also good attempts and fun to hear.<br /><br />Sandwiched inbetween is the Who's See Me, Feel Me from Tommy.  It is incorrectly labeled as We're Not Going To Take It (and shame on all those that don't point it out.  It means they didn't really listen to this album and are just reporting on the concept).<br /><br />I think the second CD is almost a total waste.  It features lesser known blues artist Little Milton.  Some of his songs, like My Dog and Me and Lump on Your Stump are just awful.  They make a big point that he recorded I Can't Quit You Babe before Led Zepplin....well, so did many others.  Anyway, I did not find anything interesting or special in his performances.  Little Milton passed away in 2005.<br /><br />Audley Feed from the Black Crowes joins to play Alice Cooper's Is It My Body. It sounds like he uses the 21st Century distorted mike, only it is too distorted.  But then they break into a monster version of Jimi Hendrix's Power of Soul.  It's the second best thing on the CD, but how can you go wrong with this song?  For some reason, in the middle of the song, Haynes starts to say \\"30 years ago today...\\" and then stops...I'm not sure what that is about.<br /><br />The last CD contains some hits and misses.  There is a very Out of the Rain and Lynard Skynards' Simple Man.<br /><br />I have been a big fan of Gov't Mule.  I think the 4 CD version of With a Little Help from of our Friends is a fantastic CD.  I like the studio albums.  I was just diappointed in this.  The poor sound quality knocks it down a star.  I will rip about half the songs and get about 100 minutes of some very good music.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down. It was poignant and emphasised the importance of opening up and not keeping everything hidden. The wasted time that we impose on ourselves and others due to a reluctance and inability to open up and share what we feeling is very sad and this book really makes you think about your own relationships and opportunities to share that might have been missed.
B00001NTXN|5.0|Great game.  Very strategic but does not take hours to play.  Good for varying ages.  Rules are simple and easy to follow.
1881273156|4.0|This book made me think about things I have not before. The quiz was fun to do and I was surprised at first to find out what my language is but after thinking about it, it did make sense. I am not sure if it really helped in the relationship but it was a good read none the less.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|But the game is addictive.I love the game, however I find it either will hang up or not synch quite a bit.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you are in your 40's - 60's,  you remember the times when mom and dad smoked in the car with the window rolled up, men harassed women at work and got away with it, women in the work force were secretaries and nothing more.  A rare few broke the mold.  Even younger generation will enjoy wathing this to see what life was like in simplier times.  This series is so spot on it makes me laugh, cry, raise my fist in anger, and rejoice.  I don't know whether I love Don Draper, pity him, or despise him, but I know I want more of him.  I can't wait for season 6 to begin.  I am a fan for life!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this app. better than Temple Run 1. Always a challenge at anytime. Good Job Imangi ! Really a fun game
0890090572|5.0|I was worried when I first got this book that it would be difficult for me to read. But it is actually very easy to read and flows well. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did a fantastic job painting the picture in my mind and entertaining me as well. Towards the end I started trying to guess who did it but I never got it right.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you get to take care of horses and get horses and compete with them. If you love horses this is the app fkr you.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Good info, music,etc. Why do you make me write so much?  I said it was good.No more wordsstop it now
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|I am a Cirque du Soleil devotee.  This was a compilation of a number of shows, all of which were excellent in their own right.  However, this one just didn't do it for me.  Perhaps it's that this was one was on screen rather than a live performance.  However, it would be a good introduction to those who have never seen a live show.
0786955570|5.0|This game is great! I love playing Dn'D but there is no way to do a quick campaign. This board games lets me and my friends quickly set up and get rolling. It was a little difficult in the beginning trying to figure out the rules at first but once it was figured it has been a lot of fun. Set up is easy and the longest we have had a game go was about 2hrs. I am planning on getting the other games soon.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|you have to wait for coins thats stupid and almost everything falls off the sides which give you nothing dont get this.
