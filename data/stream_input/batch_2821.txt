B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. lots of fun. And it was free. Me and my grandson play it together. The games our for all ages.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|I love this movie it is one of my all time favorites.....Brandon Lee does a wonderful job playing the main character, so sad that it was his last one :-(.....
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Just about all the songs on here I love. Relaxing music perfect for any time during the day. I play it sometimes for my son at bedtime, he enjoys it and so do I.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|If you like Donkey's humor in Shrek, if the dragon in Mulan makes you laugh, then you have to have this movie too. Great characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love just about anything by Fellows but he has surpassed anything one could expect with this series. It leaves you hungering for the next episode like a decadent piece of Swiss chocolate!!!!!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I really like this app for retouching photo s<br /><br />It is easy to work and it will do a lot of different things very nice it will make out of focused photos more clear
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I loved this book so much, I'm going through the enjoyable process of reading all the rest of David Sedaris' collection. I love short stories, his narrative of growing up in North Carolina, family dynamics and the fact that he is not naturally a social person only makes me love him more! Thank goodness he has so many more books for me to enjoy!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Especially with Jennifer Lawrence in it. I love Jennifer, she seems so natural and seems to effortlessly act out any part that she plays. The movie itself, except for the basic idea of children fighting to the death, is a very clean movie. No bad language, no gore, no real bloody fight scenes. It has some very touching moments of romance and love to family. I recommend this movie to all audiences, just do not let the concept of kids in an arena fighting to the death bother you.
0399226907|5.0|Always a favorite book! Eric Carle is a master at simple story, imaginative subjects and vivid illustrations. This was my choice of books for a baby shower gift when it was suggested that we give a favorite book instead of a card.
B001BANK32|4.0|Read this after reading The Stand, wanted to get into more Stephen King novels. It was quick and entertaining. Love the imagery of Colorado. A good setting is always a plus for me. I generally shy away from supernatural/thriller/horror novels, but this was a good transition book. Not too scary.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|To think that Jennifer was an unknown actor a year before this movie came out and now she is one of the most wanted actor around. There is a reason for this and her role and acting in this movie is one of the reasons. I am a little bit of a fan of Jennifer's so what I have to say may not be what many others may think. I am glad I got this movie but take that with a grain of salt. I will buy just about any J Law movie and love every minute of them..
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Not a great Movie, but quite enjoyable. Good cast of Actors, with a lighthearted approach to the storyline. Definitely worth the $1.99 rental fee.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I love her style. It kinda reminds me of Lana del ray meets lily allen. It's really relatable and fun.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|Great story of making it happen by going for your dream. This unknown puppy dog eyed girl was a perfect choice for this movie and played the role as good as anyone else could have. The sound track is excellent, the story line is interesting, cute, serious and funny all at the same time.This is the movie that I can watch every year and never get tired of it. It is considered one of the cult classic movies and worth it to own it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|There aren't any instructions so initially I didn't have a clue what was going on! But after a bit of head scratching and screen tapping it all began to make sense. I'd definitely recommend this game, it's easy enough (once you figure out what's required) but also challenging enough to make you want to keep on playing. If it had instructions, and more than 10 levels I'd have definitely given it 5 stars.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Kids love this game. Fight over who gets to play. Wish u could set it up for more than one person to play on Kindle
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|My niece told me about this movie last month so I decided to buy it. This is a very intense hang on to your seat movie. I was extremely impressed with Naomi and will go out of my way to watch more of her movies. The effects were fantastic and showed what a typical family actually went through almost 10 years ago. If you like true stories of hardship and love, this is the movie for you. You can even say it is not true and still love it. I am really surprised that this movie did not get the best movie award over Argo.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|A wonderful adventure! I have read it three times and it never gets old.  I love how it ties history and the Greek Gods to present day.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game.can't. wait for more rooms.There should be clues if you get stuck. Then I would have given 5 stars.
B00CEK9OTM|2.0|Kind of boring.  Good as a free app of the day I suppose, but I wouldn't spend money on it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|If you've seen the first season, then you already know that season two will be amazing. The incredible acting and the  attention to detail make this series a worthwhile form of entertainment. It will have you laughing, baffled and even crying by the end of it. Also, be prepared to be left on a cliff hanger, because that's exactly what will happen by the end of this season. But good news! They're almost done filming season three and you shouldn't have to wait too much longer!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great bag, sturdy and has enough space for all of my gear.  I can even take my tripod with me which came in handy a couple of times during late night impromptu shoots.  Very happy with this product!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|its similar to bejeweled ive played worse. don't care for the asking me to log in to FB every time I finish a level.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This series is a little gory and can take a while before you start to truly understand what is going on, but once you figure that out, you're hooked and eagerly waiting from episode to episode. There are times where you will laugh, cry, scream and be amazed. There will be moments where you can't decide whether or not you should love or hate your favorite characters, and best of all, you'll come back every time due to the extraordinary acting and the amount of effort that went into making  this series!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I Love Applause! I'm so happy to hear such a perfect song from Mother Monster! Keep them coming! I can't wait for the album release!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I was skeptical in the beginning and I was wondering why certain things were happening but it all came together in the end to complete a great story. Well done Grisham!!
B004132HZS|5.0|Let me just state for the record that I have seen almost all of the different versions of Sherlock Holmes, and I have to say that this has got to be my favorite out of all of them. I love the modern take on Sherlock, the cell phones, the text messages, and the attention to detail is just amazing. If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes, this is definitely a series worth giving a try.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I got bored with the story line at times and had to make myself pick the book up to read it hoping it would get better. It did go on. I almost wondered if Mr Martin had someone else write this. Funny thing is I bought the next book hoping for a better story.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I have three boys and they love this movie! They love the action and I get a kick out of the jokes geared toward adults.
B00846REIS|4.0|Sylvia Day pens a raunchy story about two wounded survivors who try to navigate through their first real relationship. The sex is frequent and hot. The characters are just interesting enough to create an actual plot. While not as refreshing as Fifty Shades of Grey, this is still worth a read if you're in the mood for a lusty romp.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really enjoying the game. Very easy to understand and very addictive. There is also so much to do. Lots of levels and lots to collect
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I love Mumford & Sons! All their songs hit home in some respect. I can't wait to see them live someday!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We had not even watched one episode of Downton Abbey until about 2 weeks ago.  Now we are hooked and playing catch up!  We try to only watch one episode a day, but we find ourselves so glued that we cheat and watch two a day on the weekends!!  Love this series.  We love the London and all that England has to offer so this is right up our alley.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Dungeon hunter is very good game . I like it so much. I play it everyday . make more games gameloft
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Tell me about addiction! I love this series and couldn't stop watching it! I can't wait until the next season is released.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Great , had not seen this episode since I was in grade school.  Brought back memories.  Great video / sound
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|In \\"Choose Yourself\\", James Altucher has written an amazing book about how one can go about doing something on one's own. There are many things to learn from the book that I have tried my best to summarize below - the book is definitely an eye-opener and should be on everybody's reading list. I truly enjoyed reading the book.<br /><br />The book can be thought of as divided into 2 main sections - the first one being \\"WHY\\" one should choose oneself (now), and, the second being \\"HOW\\" one can do it. There are a few chapters describing case studies that are indeed very inspirational. Here's what the book says, in a nutshell:<br /><br />The days when you were taken care of (by large corporations) or chosen (for a \\"job\\") are over as technology replaces people. Not only that, no sectors in the industry are hiring full time workers; instead they are relying on outsourcing or temporary workers - the middleman is being taken out of the picture, causing more disruption in employment but also more efficiencies and more opportunities for unique ideas to generate real wealth. You need to unlearn the fact that someone has to choose you, that you cannot choose yourself, or in other words, do something on your own.<br /><br />It's time to choose ones own path and build your own platform. More often than not, you will not know the destination, but you need to be bold enough to choose it for yourself, right at this moment. Choose to commoditize your labor or choose yourself - to be a creator, an innovator, an artist, an investor, a marketer and an entrepreneur. And if you don't, never blame anyone but yourself. You don't have to ask for permission, you need to grant yourself the permission.<br /><br />To choose yourself successfully, there are three very important criteria:<br /><br />1. CHOOSE TO LIVE BY TRULY LOVING YOURSELF FIRST<br />2. ONLY DO THINGS THAT YOU ENJOY. Learn to say NO, eliminate, simplify<br />3. DO THE DAILY PRACTICE. Ignite the fire within.<br /><br />The startingpoint is developing the inner perspective or the foundation, built around the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bases; it is from a healthy foundation of these four bases that you build the platform to choose yourself. Trust that when the foundation is built, the rest will follow. How you build this is as follows:<br /><br />1. Physical Body: healthy eating, daily exercise, sleep well, take breaks at regular intervals, preferably walk during breaks, take adequate rest.<br />2. Emotional Body: surround yourself with positive people. Avoid people who bring you down and/or induce negativity.<br />3. Mental Body: tame your mind by becoming an \\"idea machine\\" (come up with 10 ideas a day on anything that can improve life).<br />4. Spiritual Body: live this moment, right now. Don't time travel into the past or future.<br /><br />This part is similar to the Habit 7 (Sharpen the Saw) that Stephen Covey describes in his great work \\"7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\"; James gives his own brilliant interpretation that is contemporary.<br /><br />It's not your external life that need to change (you anyway have very little control over that), but external changes flow from the inside. It is always inside-out, not outside-in. The simple daily practice means doing ONE thing every day from the list put down in chapter by the same name. All of this is under your control, so just do it and don't fret over the results. The right thing will happen. This is how you ignite the fire within you. Don't worry too much about trying to find your \\"purpose\\" in life. Once you decide to choose yourself, be open, try different things. Cut out the desperation and despair that \\"purpose\\" entails. It's okay to be happy without one. And, always, love yourself.<br /><br />To choose yourself, you need to start by getting rid of your past baggage, de-clutter your brain, and maybe suffer a \\"little death\\" to be born again. The point is to resurrect yourself, so you can start afresh, to get the freedom that dispappearing implies. Ask yourself if your job is satisfying your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual needs. If not, quit your job, and if you can't, do the daily practice to enable you to find the right place where you belong. You will find ways to develop alternative sources of income so your reliance on one source of income diminishes. The opportunities are there, you need to flexible enough to take advantage. If you are in crisis, turn despair on its head. Start with baby steps; BUT, it's most important to start, NOW.<br /><br />If you have an idea, don't focus on the money, focus on the value you can create for those who would be using your service. Do this:<br /><br />1. Build your product<br />2. Sell it to a customer (\\"Becoming a Master Salesman\\" chapter describes the 10 keys to selling)<br />3. Start shipping<br />4. Then quit your job<br /><br />The other key aspects of choosing oneself are covered as:<br /><br />1. 7 effective habits for conquering mediocrity<br />2. How to focus your mind?<br />3. Honesty is the only thing that works.<br />4. How to handle rejection and failure?<br /><br />Here are seven chapters (mostly inspirational case studies) that are a must re-read:<br /><br />1. Sara Blakeley's story of Spanx in the chapter \\"It doesn't cost a lot to make $1B\\"<br />2. Bryan Johnson's story of Braintree in the chapter \\"Let's get specific: what should I do?\\"<br />3. \\"Nine Lessons from Alex Day\\"<br />4. Dashama's story in the chapter \\"The Curious Case of the Sexy Image\\"<br />5. 5 lessons learnt from Gandhi in the chapter \\"Gandhi chose himself to free and entire nation\\"<br />6. \\"Nine things I learnt from Woody Allen\\"<br />7. \\"How to become an idea machine?\\" - it's a goldmine<br /><br />The only reason I don't rate this book at 5 (I wish one could rate 4.5 on Amazon) is because it takes a bit of work towards the latter half of the book to connect the different chapters to the overall theme; it's not very explicit and takes some effort on part of the reader.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Ken Follett's books, whether historical, suspense or whatever are well worth reading.  Once I start one of his books I cant stop.<br />One of my favourite authors.
B003L77GG0|3.0|Smallville season (1-7) 5 stars, (8-9) 4 stars and season (10) I'll give it 3 stars, but it deserves  2.  After creators Al Gough and Miles Millar left, they couldn't keep up the full greatest that the show originally had, but did 2 pretty good seasons (8-9). Season 10  had significantly shown poor quality for episode ideas and keeping up with the series. In my opinion the writers didn't know how to end the series, so they came up with a lot of random episodes and then gave us a pretty crumby series finale. I would say about 10 episodes are actually good though, but the series  finale was not one of them. The first hour of the finale was a little boring dragging on about  Lois and clarks vows as they recite them In there mind and so on. During the finale there was a giant planet or sun coming to earth, but during the last hour it stayed a float in the air over Smallville until the very end when a little dot ( Clark as superman catches it). I thought that the producers where very cheap in showing Clark in the superman suit and most of the time either showed a very very small superman or just a close up of clarks face with the sky in the back ground. I don't understand why they couldn't create some great moments fully showimg him in the suit when in the past they always showed great superhero special effects. I was really excited after the season 9 finale that in season 10 he was going to be superman but it did not happen. Smallville is still one of the greatest shows of all time, even though season 10 was a let down.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I liked the free app so much,  I took the chance on Pro paid app. I DID EVERYTHING to get Pro to work including a hard reset to factory settings!  And only Pro app installed.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I really like Cut the rope! Om nom is adorable and his disco relative is pretty cool. They should give him a hippie relative he,d have a tie-dyed shirt a rainbow agro and sandals he'd look real adorable in an idiotic sort of way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|There is a lot for kids to do and keep busy with this fun game! My daughter loves caring for her horse and playing all the games within!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|A lot of people are saying that this is a weird movie.  I ... agree with them.  But then I like weird.  This movie feels more like an artistic independent film than the average run of the mill just get it into theaters type of movie.  This movie doesn't have any themes too mature but it doesn't really look like a kids movie either.  Kids won't follow much of the humor and definitely won't get the story line.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My grandson downloaded this game and he seems to like it a lot. It is very fast paced and thrilling.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|We watched this for the first time and really enjoyed it.  The quality of the video was great and had no problems streaming, etc.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really like this game. It just as good as temple run. Love the minions and the whole cast. Very very good
B00008G8LN|5.0|Good mix of the noirish and the action/adventure genres. It is well worth the reasonable cost of this DVD edition product.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|This is almost a really good film. We know from the previews that Hanna is a young girl who has been training her whole life to be an assassin. It takes until nearly the end of the film to find out why. The critical plot info is doled out in a trickle. Instead of adding to the suspense, this just makes it harder to connect with Hanna, her father, or their mutual enemy.  The movie would have been much better if they had just explained at the beginning why the father would raise his child like that. Eric Bana was good as the father. They missed a huge opportunity by making him virtual wallpaper. I usually love Cate Blanchett, but her southern accent was TERRIBLE. Just terrible. Finally, the ending was very abrupt. Boom, done. It didn't really feel finished, but the credits rolled anyway.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|What's not to like or can you say about a classic film that has two top box office stars in the country.
B008KHRODG|5.0|awesome series this is the final episodes of david tennant as the tenth doctor and he goes out with a bang
B000P0J0AG|5.0|Whats not to like or say about a classic film that has two of the worlds top movie stars. Excellent!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|the movie is a great one to watch with the family. its great for all ages and is action packed from beginning to end
B007PTJOV0|5.0|purchased this for my six year old and he loves it.  the concept is similar to Super Mario Bros.  definitely recommend.

B0067R0APK|4.0|I would like to have the ability to relocate (or fine tune) the mark that indicates my home.  When I initialized the app, I did not know that I could zoom in really close and I just guessed where my house was.  I was really off and I would like to correct my error.  With that ability added think the app would rate five stars.
B00EH49DXA|3.0|Nice tune, highly derivative (&#34;eye of the tiger&#34; and other lyrical mentions), well sung.<br />She's done much better in the past.
B00459EZLW|5.0|I will really miss not having SG.U 3, a great series. The sets, acting, and scrip was excellent. Bring it back!!
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Loved this show. was very fun but had a serious side to it which made it more enjoyable to watch
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Lion King is one hour and twenty - eight minutes and was released in theaters on June 15, 1994. The story is about an orphan lion cub named Simba who is blamed for the killing of Mufasa, his father. With the urging of his Uncle Scar he runs away. Timon (meerkat) and Pumba (warthog) find the stranded Simba in the desert and rescue him from what would have been a meal for a bunch of vultures. They take him in and raise Simba like one of the family. Nala (a female lion) happens to be in his neck of woods and finds Simba who encourages him to go back and take his rightful place as King of the Pride Lands. She tells him that Scar is an awful leader. Simba refuses because it would mean facing his past. Finally Rafiki (a mandrill) finds Simba and takes him to his father. Simba and Mufasa have spiritual talk and Simba realizes what he has to. He heads back to Pride Rock to take his rightful place. There is one major difference between the DVD and VHS version; in the VHS version the memory of Frank Wells is in big yellow letters at the start of the film and in the DVD version it is in small print at the end of the movie. A piece of trivia about the film is it is the only animated album to go Diamond, meaning it has sold over ten million albums or more. The Lion King is a great movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Play<br />Scene Selection<br />Bonus Features<br />I.

B00425S1H8|2.0|Setup:<br /><br />-OS X 10.8.4<br />-MacBookPro6,2<br /><br />I have to do a full shutdown before I can disconnect the adapter, otherwise, I get a Kernel Panic &#34;You need to restart your computer…&#34;<br /><br />It works great for connecting to Cisco gear, but the power issue makes it cumbersome to use.
B006PAV1XO|3.0|Better love story than comedy. Good acting. But it was just a one timer for me. Not a wast of time though
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Great choice of actors cast for all the voices. Animation is top notch as expected.<br /><br />Not sure if they could make a sequel, but I hope they can find a way to expand this original story.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Had never heard of this film, so what a excellent surprise I had for this beauty. Sorry it did not get more press, it is a hidden gem.

B008MVPB6C|4.0|the crocs fit just perfectly and they are great, I love them. I love also the color. Now im buying jibbitz
B00A8ECU24|4.0|You will need money to further in the game. The game itself is free but I'm afraid you will need patience to fully complete it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Jack Reacher is a character that is very good at what he does.  He has through is military police training developed a keen sense of what to do and when to do it.
1416955070|5.0|I really loved this entire series.  It's like a soap opera of vampires, warlocks, angels, demons, were-wolves.  Really cool.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B001NB5BXG|5.0|Abba had a sound that was unique and the group was very good together.  Which is why they were so popular

B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty is by far and away the best film made about the war on terror, an honor previously held by The Hurt Locker also directed by Catherine Bigelow. The film is taut, at times disturbing and thought provoking. Bigelow has proven she is the master of the genre.
B00B671VYU|5.0|Me and my son love Lordi and we own all their CDs so we of course bought this. Compared with other CDs from Lordi it is maybe less &#34;instrumental&#34; and more hard rock, but there are songs that have their special brand, which I like so much, like &#34;The riff&#34; and Schizo doll&#34;.

B004LM72ZY|5.0|We love basic toys that are well-made, durable, and simple enough to foster the imagination of kiddos. This toy from Playmobil is no exception-- the rocket ship has an astronaut inside and is well-sized for toddler hands. Our kiddos LOVES this toy. Its easy to take outside (no small pieces to lose), and its well-made and will survive lots of play in the sand or dirt.<br /><br />Best of all-- no lights, no noise, and no batteries. It runs on imagination : )
0345525558|5.0|This wasn't an easy read, but it was a very well written story and left me hoping the author will write a sequel to this book!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|This \\"Movie\\" crashed and burned right from the start.  They start off with a beautiful naked woman and a partied out guy starting the day.  Meant ziltch without a little character development.  John Goodman's character was pretty cool and ruthless.<br />One of my major issues is  Don Cheadle,  he is more Actor than the roles he gets.  I have no doubt he is a much better actor than the jerkwad Jamie Foxx, yet he keeps getting second Banana roles.  Denzel Washinton did a great job - as always.<br />Having been associated with the Aviation World for 50 years or more.  I was offended how they portrayed the problem solving / punishment process.  Yeah, there are those both Professionally and Pleasure Pilots that think they are Sky Gods and can get away with Drinking and Drugs.  A good number of them are either presntly Wal-Mart Greeters or embedded in a smoking crater.<br />There seems to be an accepted practise of denigrating honorable people who are Christians.  Am not a Bible Thumper by any stretch but it is tiresome seeing ignorant people pushing a political agenda.<br />I am sorry I spent the time watching this movie that I did.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I found this book very interesting, being a dog lover myself.  It is so amazing to think of all the things humans do that are probably understood and wondered at by our canine companions.  They are the most loyal friends a person can have, not human but supplied by the Creator for our use and pleasure.  Take good care of them!
B007IK44CK|3.0|I enjoyed it. Good escapist movie to relax and watch some fun action. Not too deep, but that's what I expected.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It helps because you don't need to go on the internet all the time. Its epic and useful. great App
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble the famous smooth singer in the fine traditions of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Perry Como, and Nat King Cole recorded a wonderful Christmas Album with an orchestra, other singers that make this an old fashioned style Christmas Album with Buble's great voice. Traditional Christmas Carols and standards make this an instant classic that will be played throughout the Christmas seasons in the future! My favorite is \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\". If you enjoy great Christmas Songs sung like the smooth crooners of yesteryear, then Michael Buble's Christmas Album is the one for you! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B008LFY6NI|1.0|This app is fun, but is damaged your screen!When you are drawing when it's spinning then you stop it, it still has the image where ever you go on your device! I HATE THIS APP!! DO NOT GET IT!!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The authors do a great job presenting the evidence, mostly preliminary on the human side.  I see that more studies are starting on the effects of intermittent fasting on cancer and Alzheimer's, so I will look for the results.  My personal results are great - lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and heart rate, and 57 pounds lost in 5.5 months.  I confess I do not overeat on my feast days.  Hunger no longer drives me, and the fasting has allowed me to be satisfied with most smaller portions.  I recommend it to all who do not have physical conditions that preclude them from participating!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Was a great game after update it won't even load. My son loves this game please fix. So pleasecfix this soon!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is one of the best short works I have read in recent time. Very inspiring and gripping, especially when it gets to the story of Tesla. Inspires you to achieve excellence. Its a very quick read. the kindle version is free. Would definitely recommend it to everyone. Excellent book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can play this game for hours. It is easy enough to keep you playing, but hard enough to be challenging.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was a little repetitive.  Not what I expected.  Liked the beginning but then the story dragged.  Would like to see the tv series.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|Loved Grumpy Book even if Grumpy Cat would not approve. Although I am quite grumpy on a fairly regular basis which Grumpy Cat would not care about. If you love cats this book will make you smile and even laugh. So there Grumpy Cat:)
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I love this series and pandemonium was just amazing. I wish some of the characters were more involved than usual but other than that I love how lena manages to survive though everything she goes through. I also loved that it was in both Hana and Lena's perspective, which lets us as the readers know so much more. . such a good read, could not put it down!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Love love love this movie, upgraded to blue ray.......played on our new smart TV makes a HUGE difference. Recommend it.
0671015206|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door is a terrific book! It shows you the ideas in minds of those who strive to become successful and those who want to know the ways of starting the life of a smarter thinker to gaining the success they want out of life. You learn how the real millionaires start off and how they dress and live amongst others. An absolute great book to learn stepping stones on beginning a successful start of life! Book was delivered fast and in excellent condition.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I honestly wish I had stopped this film a few minutes into it, but I gave it a chance since I like Ms. Berry and Mr. Hanks as actors. Big mistake. I really wanted it to get good, yet it tortures on & on. Cloud atlas is just a horribly weird movie and a complete mess. Oh its true true. It felt like Tom Hanks comedy hour with all the ridiculous characters he plays. It jumps scenes so often and I was left trying to understand it's rather strange message afterwards. I wish I could rate it zero stars. Please don't waste your time. Pass.
B00B2166BS|5.0|High quality materials, charges a little bit faster than USB cable, but really its best feature is easy attachment and detachment without the danger of damaging the charging port. Quite often I pick up N10 in the dark not being sure if the charging cable is connected, with USB cable this can potentially damage USB port,  however pogo cable simply falls off, eliminating all worries.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So far, the site comes up every time I ask it unlike Weather Channel. Time will tell, but so far, I like it!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|its a good game, but having to pay out of pocket for ponies you NEED to advance in the mission really does kill it. and is it just me or does someone else have like a million octavia's? ever since they moved her it glitched and gave me a ton of her. not to mention there little theator doesn't work. watched every little video ten times and got nothing. seriously guys this game would be loads better without all the glitches and greed. they need to either lower the prices of jewels or get rid of the jewels. its no fun if you have to spend hundrads of dollars on ponies.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Needed to upgrade my PC and went with the Ivy Bridge i5-3570.  Really, can't go wrong for mid-tier PC builds.  Will handle basically any game you throw at it and won't disappoint one bit.  Great buy.
B008MM9630|5.0|i love this app so much i had it before but i  deleted it so i got it again for a new start and i am addicted to it once again i totally recommend this app for people to play :D
B003VANOFY|5.0|In my opinion, probably the best wireless headset on the market for the price I payed on Amazon.  Couldn't pass it up.  AWESOME surround sound.  G-key programmable buttons.  Good up to 40 ft (although I don't know why you'd want to sit 40 ft away from your monitor, but nice selling point).  Battery lasts long, like over 8 hrs.  If you can't figure out which headset to purchase, look no further and buy this headset NOW.
B001M0HGR2|2.0|It keeps buffering and it is  a pain .like half way through the movie it stops please credit me or some thing
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Does what it needs to! Never have problems with this app. Facebook is a great way to interact with friends.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Wow - Just finished watching the new Blu-Ray release of Shane and it is awesome to say the least. As a huge fan of this movie I have waited decades to see Shane look this good. The previous released DVD issues with blue specks and poor clarity have been totally rectified here. And what a great movie it is to see again. The tension between Shane (the great Alan Ladd) and Jack Wilson (the great Jack Palance) as they size each other up at Joe Starrett's (Van Heflin) ranch, the brutal shooting of Torrey (Elisha Cook Jr.), the unspoken love affair between Marion (Jean Arthur)/Shane and of course the classic final sequence with Joey (Brandon De Wilde) desperately screaming for Shane to come back. I suppose one can wish for a western film this great to be made again someday although it will probably never happen. But there may be hope for as Shane tells Marion before he rides off to shoot it out with Wilson \\"Never's a Long Time\\".
B00026WU7I|5.0|My previous disc was &#34;borrowed&#34; and never returned. Been without it for 2 years.I believe this to be the best overall Dylan album. Great price, fast service. Thanks!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this trilogy, i would recommend this to all my friends. I can not wait to read Fifty shades freed
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Action was well timed. Story line was intriguing  and kept my attention. Hoping for sequel to be in the works.
0812550706|5.0|This story was really different and unique. I liked it very much. And ender was an amazing character. The whole thought of ender being like thirty years old at the end was a bit weird and the twist at the end was quite shocking, but all in all I likes the book very much. It was pretty slow and that's the reason why I won't be teasing the other books, not because they aren't good or anything I just don't have the time. But it's really unique and richly detailed. I think boys like it more than girls do. But you should read it nonetheless. Have fun!!
B007HACDLK|3.0|A ok read based on a well established character.  Definitely not his best. Have to wonder if writing duties were turned over to coauthor
B00280LYHS|5.0|THESE BOOKS ARE FREAKING AMAZING!! LIKE BREATH-TAKING GORGEOUS!! AND FANTASTIC!! I read them two years ago but never had the chance to write a review. Honestly, I cant be glad or thankful enough that I have read them. They changed my life. They added a whole different world into mine. They made my imagination and perspective bigger. They made me believe more. They made me excited, and happy, and sad and so many another emotions. If you haven't already read them, I'll tell you this; you're missing out A LOT. So hurry and read them. You wont regret it ;)THE END WAS GORGEOUS AND BEAUTIFUL!! I COULDNT HAVE IMAGINED IT BETTER, I'M VERY MUCH SATISFIED!! and don't be mad at how much they changed the movie, you cant ever expect a movie to be as good as the book. I'm fifteen and I think these books are good for anyone and everyone. Enjoy reading!! :D
B005DJRD80|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the first two seasons of Awkward. I think it does a pretty good job of representing those hard years and the cast was phenomenal. Can't wait until Season 3!

B0015F1VY8|5.0|Wonderful continuation of the original Elizabeth. The story seems to be unreal, but everything is factual and fantastic. Wonderful acting and great characters. Awesome directing. One of my favorite movies.
0486284735|5.0|well, I'm fifteen years old and I read this book for school, and can I just say that I have never really enjoyed classics at all that much but this one....OMG!! this one was GOOD!! It was a bit hard to read sometimes due to the advanced vocabulary but I loved the story. I wish I was more like Elizabeth. And I wish I had a husband like Mr. Darcy. I'm sure my love story wont be as amazing as theirs but I only hope that it will. It's romantic and beautiful.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I tried to complete a section once or twice a day. I soon figured out I could turn of the dialog.  Sometimes I enjoyed the dialog and other times I just wanted to play. I couldn't solve some of the extra games so it was nice I could skip and move on. I loved finding keys and opening new hiding places. It would have been more fun if at games end you had an opportunity to go to another game(paid or not)
0486266885|3.0|I read this for my English 10 honors class. It's really interesting, yes I admit. And easy to read. But it's not so appealing to a fifteen year old girl like me who usually reads science fiction or young adult books. I liked the science fiction part of it. I think it's more for older man to read. But every one has different points of views. So it's not my favorite book yeah, but it's the 21st century, considering the the world has changed quite a lot, I think it's pretty normal
B0038M61BE|5.0|Outstanding classic session.  Pepper can sometimes be derivative and boring, but not here.  And Miles Davis' rhythm section is tight and innovative, providing superb support.

B008XG1X18|5.0|great way to organize the things you love! easy to get inspired to try something new. super easy to use.
014241493X|5.0|I laughed quite a lot while reading this book. It was a good adventure. Although I already knew the feeling of a paper town, I didn't really know what to call it. I think that most of America is a paper town really. There is few places you'll go and see that aren't. In every state, there is museums, and zoos, and opera house, same horizontal lap siding houses with different houses every where... Trees, and roads, and cars, and malls, and shooks, and college... There isn't much that's unique.. Anyways, I lived this book because it was richly detailed as usual, and John green again pointed out things about life that we all know but never quite speak out loud or give much of a though too, and there were also things that I didn't know about life and realized while reading this book... John green amazed me one more time with this humorous book and I thank him very much for this beautiful literature. Enjoy reading it, you might not like the end that much but we all know how much authors love to annoy us with not giving complete details and leaving us wondering how it all went. At least in disney stories, they used to say \\"and they lived happily ever after\\"... :)
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|my husband plays this religiously on his tablet, kids want to play along on my tablet. downloaded it, press open, kicks me back to home screen. unloaded, reloaded, nothing works. it would be nice to play it

Sometimes, I wish I was like her, she is so badass!! She is like a goddess, she's completely amazing!! And she is definitely one of the best narrators I have ever read!! I should say the ending was pretty messed up, and left me quite miserable, but it gets better at the end of the series, don't worry ;)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Amazon and Kindle have created an outstanding device that gives me access to unlimited information with minimal internet connectivity and user friendly apps and competitive prices. I like anything relating to Google - Google is changing the world and if my instincts are correct, for the better. If anyone  has trouble accessing information with the tools you have  given them, then they aren't ready for the responsibility of learning.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app I'd a great app I would get it . It is challenging yet fun . So get it now and u can answer the question, can you escape
B005LAII44|4.0|I would agree with the rest of amazon reviews that this film should be around 3 stars means it's just ok. (amazon = 1-2 stars bad, 3 stars ok, 4-5 stars good). I am being a little nice here with giving this film 4 stars because it had pretty cool, graphics, stunts, cool weaponry and machines.<br />This film fell way flat for me though in regards to the first one. The first joe had channing and marlyon and there was a lot of energy and excitement. This sequel *spoilers* wrote channing out, didn't even have marlyon and basically was just all about dwayne johnson. With that bad taste in my mouth being said it was a decent film. The first half was a little slow but it picks up the second half of the movie. I kept thinking channing tatum would somehow come back in the film but the producers obviously just wanted dwayne johsnon in it. Probably because of not wanting to pay actors salaries, which is usually why they have to cast b-list actors. Even though I may consider dwayne j. an a list actor i was expecting a lot more out of this sequel and was let down / disappointed. But if i woudl have seen this film as a separate film it would have been ok. I don't know what is up with hwood movies lately feeling very generic and stale but you can just pop out any piece of garbage and think it's going ot be the next blockbuster.<br />Not else is to be said about this film. I would wait until this movie comes out on tv instead of paying any money for it. Thanks for reading. Godbless<br /><br />~shauns movie review
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Zodiac is a fascinating movie that portrays the Zodiac Killer's reign of terror over the San Francisco in the late 1960's and early 1970s.  Every scene is carefully made.  Cars are the right models for the time, TV's, phones, and radios reflect the technology of the day, even the contemporary-to-the-timeframe of the movie public's ignorance of crime is shockingly displayed when a young mother pulls over on a dark road due after the Zodiac lures her to stop.<br /><br />The movie's imagery during the Zodiac's spree is shockingly dark.  The lighting, music, and scenes are suspenseful and excellently done.  The hot search for the killer draws the viewer in.<br /><br />However, the movie follows the truth of the actual Zodiac killer's story.  It is anti-climatic.  The Zodiac has never been caught.  The case is beyond cold and moving into the status of folk legend.  Interesting enough, it seems that the late 1960's through to the middle 1970s is a time in which highly intelligent criminals out-maneuvered the police.  Along with the Zodiac Killer, D.B. Cooper (hijacking 1971) has likewise never been found.  The remains of the movie consists of speculation and following up of earlier leads but no real closure.<br /><br />A great movie, but the story, the actual turn of events is ultimately unsatisfying.

B005ZUR724|5.0|I think it's awesome it's kind of WoW on a tablet and phone. It sometimes gets bad graphics but that's okay New update is awesome.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Worst Tarantino ever made. Great cast, good performances. 2:45 minutes needed 45 minutes cut out. Do not waste your money on this one unless it is Free!
B003097B64|4.0|Great band. All Lowell George years. You get what you pay for, Packaging was not what I expected (paper sleeves).
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Liked it overall. If combined with other literature on the subject, could lead to some real breakthroughs re: our knowledge and belief system re: the afterlife.
B0061JPT46|2.0|I bought this to replace a cassette copy I had. My copy was all stereo (can't be found). This was not.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I can sit and play this for hours. It is a good way to relax in the evening. Would recommend this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i LOVE this game. if you like subway surfers you will love this game. its also for all ages. GET THIS GAME
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Pretty good game quite addictive game reminds me of the Mario game which is good and it is a great time filler.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I have found a new author to follow. I love when that happens.<br /><br />This is book one in a new series. I really enjoyed the story. A small town, people who watch out for each other. A hurt but strong woman, a hot guy who cares. Plus he comes with a sister & brother.<br /><br />If you like small town stories with big heart please give this series a chance.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|dialog is annoying, games are repetitive and simple. much of the same over and over. &quot;helpful&quot; character's voice is the worst... &quot;I'll find it!!&quot;... ugh!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I found it difficult to finish, it was boring from the beginning  I read the whole thing but did we ever get to heaven?  Calling God OM was offensive and if you really believe in God you will understand what I mean.  Sorry, this was a waste of time, yours and mine.
B008B8DY2O|4.0|I am half through the book only but it keeps me wishing to be there and feel the smells and the colours of India
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a pleasant challenge for me.  I look forward to getting some quiet time so I can play a few levels.
B00008WT5J|5.0|Had the cassette back in the 80's and got nostalgic.  Call it AC/DC for people who hate AC/DC.  It's just good stuff!
B0057LUI0O|5.0|My granddaughter watches this movie, over and over, she loves the characters, bright vivid colors music and storyline. well worth the price.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed this show.  It has a different plot for a change. Good acting, and suspenseful until the end.<br />Can't wait to see the next movie in the series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book I have read in a while. Cannot wait to start Mockingjay, I hope that it is as good as this book.
1609611543|3.0|The book is based on solid science.  Essencially a gluten free diet book, it is needing to provide more options than just say what you should not eat.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Not entirely unpredictable, but when you watch enough of these things, it's tough to find one that surprises you. But it had good effects, enough suspense to make it interesting. All in all it was certainly worth renting :)
B000V39KDO|5.0|I saw this movie @ the theater but I had to have it in my collection. Someone decide to take it from me so I am buying it again.This movie is worth every dime!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new update interface is much harder to use and does not update properly. You have taken a great app and turned it into a piece of junk. Please give us the option of going back to the old version while you fix this one.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Went out on a limb to try a new brand of mouse manufacturer. Nice build and no troubles so far. Wish the weights were more heavy though but this is minor. Happy with my purchase and will consider future Anker products going forward.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|This is the best of the 3 Mortal Instruments books I have read so far, will b reading the others to see how they hold up.<br />Clary is finally coming into her own yet she is so impulsive which drives me nuts...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the KISS METHOD of doing most things in my life... This Calculator Plus Free fits very nicely into that method. Large numbers are the best, easily seen &amp; tapped.  If you are looking for a simple balancing your checkbook math app, this is the one for you! Try it :-)
B00E3UN44W|5.0|Oh the pain the torment. I agree with all of the reviews of the first review. I want what , what you have said has not been filmed/finished and have placed my order just so I can dream that some day to my door step season three will come. I may be dead before then of said  heart attack but I will try to wait just because I love the show and actors.
B0000024YL|5.0|You like current  crap like  Maroon  whatever?  no insult meant but  music is  melody and Harmony.  Then if required  instrumentalists.  Does Sam Moore, Rod Stewart, the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zepplin ring a bell? Clapton and Beck?  hear them  and get back to me!!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love Uno, but I'm truly getting tired of games that want you to...<br />1 Connect to Facebook so you spam your friends/family<br />2 Make you wait to play<br />3 Pay....for everything.<br /><br />I'm good...uninstalling, and sitting &quot;Indian Style&quot; on the floor with real people. I'll find a different game that's truly FREE.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Fun at first, but gets boring very quickly.  Good thing it was free, as I would not be happy if I paid for it.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|I purchased this on recommendation of a successful dieter!  It is an excellent update and a very good plan for those who need to lose a little or a lot!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I guess this will be my new way of reading novels. I love it when I always thought that I needed a book in my hands,
B0041G68KU|5.0|I read quite a few of the reviews on this book before I started it and everything I read built it up to be a classic ghost story in the original form. I wasn't disappointed. The story builds slowly but keeps you there every step of the way. I couldn't tell what was going to happen next. Totally loved it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome!!!!:)great app  you should get it you will probably like it as much as I do so yea get it !!!!!!
B007QUUJMG|1.0|Hated the story, hated the characters, hated the way it was written. Did finish it but I will never get those hours back again! Not my thing at all!
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I did not expect much but the movie was really good I love'd it the clothes were really great and it was dark the Benhamin rocked
B002UBRFDC|5.0|delivered quickly on kindle. easy to read and saved me money. So much for buying regular books reading is easier this way
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how some authors can conjure entire worlds with just a free words or an offhand phrase. The Ocean ant the End of the Lane takes the reader on a fantastically imagined trip, and hints of layers of magic and realities that paint a fantastic cosmology in the minds eye. Gaian takes you on a deeper and richer honey in less than 200 pages than other authors can manage in 800.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|delivered quickly on kindle. easy to read and saved me money. So much for buying regular books reading is easier this way
0385523394|5.0|Really enjoyable and provocative. Timely too. This book is a good example of why mandatory sentencing should be changed. Too many people locked up for too small of reasons.  Costs skyrocketed when this thoughtless  punishment was established.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|delivered quickly on kindle. easy to read and saved me money. So much for buying regular books reading is easier this way
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|This movie used the same basic plat devices but made no attempt to copy the original characters. I found the plot interesting and the action well done. The developing relationship among the team was a highlight. I recommend.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|You gave a truly great review. I very much appreciate your time and effort reviewing, comparing Shazam and Soundhound. Thanks you.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Never worked on my Kindle Fire. I tried to download several times. Oh well, I don't have time to play anyway.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Liked the book very much.  Gives a person something to think about and he has back up on his findings.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book will change the way you look at the world. Will convince you that we humans are not as rational as we think.Destined to become a classic.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|All of the Dr. Panda games are awesome. Both my 3 and 5-year old LOVE them ALL!! They keep them busy during long car rides and are wonderful. Definitely their favorite app:)
0345404475|5.0|Not only the story is original and interesting. Besides it is the nobel that gave birth to Ridleys Scott Blade Runner Film, it is a shocking exposure of human dilema with life and the fact that we will die, and how much \\"time\\" we have left to exist.  It has very interesting quotes that force you to rethink your life and existance in this planet.
B00594XOZU|2.0|It's been way to long since this has had an update. Unlike the versions on Google Play and other Android/ iOS providers. I'm using the Kindle Fire, and the little box our text appears in is an inch and a couple millimeters. Smaller than the old mini Go Phone advertised long ago. Why do all other phones utilize the full screen, while ours is about half the size of some ones pinky. Everything is needlessly small. Another issue is when talking to someone who is using the update version, whenever they link something I get an &quot;unsupported on this version of kik&quot; message.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|One of the richest, funniest books that I have read in many years.<br />There are more twists and turns and name-dropping than I could possibly imagine.<br />I'm going to see what else Mr Jonasson has written.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I liked it because it was entertaining.  If you like the show Castle you will like this book.  I liked the suspense.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|didnt follow the book very much but was actually good. i was surprised, i didnt expect it to be as good as it was
B0015AARJI|5.0|I love the dualshock controllers. Nothing much to say except if you have played with one you know they are pretty cool :)
0679809015|5.0|The flaps in this book are nice, sturdy and difficult for strong fat fingers to tear off.  It held the attention of a 1.5 yr old who isn't that interested in books. Great buy price wise for an interactive book.  Cute writing that lines up nicely with what is happening in the pictures.  I would recommend it for sure!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed the narration aspect of the book. The book lived up to other great reviews that I read.
1423136802|5.0|Great series of books... My daughter enjoys the stories and is now comparing the content to the recently released theatrical versions of the stories.  This is a great boxed set and the price was right.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game! Alot of fun! Would like to get tokens faster or more at a time,but other than that it's great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. So good that I read it in one sitting. I could not put it down.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Enjoyed it, interesting writing style, good characters - though lots of gore!- and good plot well twisted.  Will be buying more of Lee CHild
B00E193Y36|3.0|Love the album. Big fan. Just not happy with my download. It glitches throughout the album. This is the second album its happened on. Don't think I will take the chance again. It sucks to be jammin out to your favorite song and all of a sudden nothing. Guess I'll just by the CD and download it. Live and learn.
1611734207|5.0|The author has done a magnificent job of researching a very unpopular American temperament -- introversion.  However, as research shows, about 40% of the population has this temperament. The chapter on the Harvard School of Business made my hair stand on end.  These people are running the country?  No wonder we're in such bad shape.  The chapters on research in education show that we are definitely doing something very wrong -- in schools and the workplace.  This is must reading for parents, administrators, educators, and well, just anybody.<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Cain
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This short but effective book at deconstructing what my mind already knew, but my consciousness didn't because of common media of how things work for normal people. Very relieving to read this.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Really easy to understand. Don't have to buy anything, scratch cards help keep the tokens. Really enjoying playing this game.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I loaded this app on the kid's kindles. I would like it more if the words were a little bigger for a parent not wearing glasses. I would also like more sounds. Overall, it does what it's suppose to do.

B00C2WF6XA|5.0|I have 8 of these Japan budget cd's by Coleman and Coltrane and every one has EXCELLENT sound. See my review of the mono My Favorite Things by Coltrane. All the others have been stereo- and this one in particular benefits from the wonderful mastering in this series (Jazz Best Collection 1000). A usually crowded sonic landscape is now cleaned up and more than any other release so far, I can hear more individual intruments and thus more of the interplay and dynamics of the music. I love free jazz in general and this issue of this classic makes it all the more powerful and vital. Not to be missed!

B001YXVOU2|5.0|This is a Dylan album that should not be missed.  Clearly, he was riding a wave incredible creativity, extending the brilliance of Nashville Skyline into yet another collection of beautiful songs.  Once again he creates an album of songs in a unique style.....folk meets rock meets waltz meets stunning poetry.<br /><br />If dogs run free, then why not me, across the swooping plains.....<br /><br />Need i say more?  Let Dylan do it...

B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I have been playing UNO with Friends for more than 9 months.  While I really love the game, every time I play (and I am not exaggerating), I encounter problems that result in my loss or use of tokens and coins to continue playing.  I have submitted numerous complaints via the Gameloft website and received compensation.  While it is frustrating, I felt it was worth it since I was being compensated for the problems I encountered.  In the past weeks I have been denied compensation due to their \\"strict policy\\" in gifting; a specific reasoning was not given as this was a \\"confidential policy.\\"  I decided to call Customer Service\\" so I could speak to a live person and get some answers.<br /><br />I spoke to two people and was hung up by both!!  But, I was told 1) one reason for this change was that they were going to provide an update soon to solve the problem.  I asked what \\"soon\\" meant and was told a couple of weeks!!!  That is not soon.  Who wants to play for two weeks, encounter problems each time you play, and not be compensated for the loss of coins and tokens??!!  2) Another reason given was that they felt some people were lying and submitting false reports of losses.  I believe that false reports can happen, but I don't agree with across the board denials.  You should be able to substantiate the false or true reports and compensate accordingly.  3) Then, I was told that I had been compensated \\"enough\\" and wouldn't be compensated in the future.  So, I asked if I were to continue playing before the update and encountered problems, I would not be compensated?  She said, \\"You need to be patient\\" and wait for the update.  Patient?!!!  I have been playing a defective game for over 9 months, submitted 1-4 complaints a week, continued to play, I need to be patient?  And, the tone of this person was not customer friendly.  I am sorry I did not get this person's name.  I said, I would forgive all prior complaints submissions.  I asked if I continued to play over the next 2weeks, encountered problems, and submitted a complaint, would I still be denied.  Yep, denied.  Why should I play?<br /><br />I am a retired business person.  Two of the most important requirements for a successful business are to have a quality product and to have quality customer service.  My assessment is that Gameloft has failed on both fronts.  I am not satisfied with the product or the current quality of customer service.

B005LAIIMG|1.0|When \\"World War Z' first came on the market as a Book & Audio-Book by Max Brooks (Author & Narrator) - I was enchanted with the way the story was presented --  From the perspective of a UN Observer / Historian, gathering the testimony from survivors, Ten Years in the Future!  When I heard they were making a film adaptation starring Brad Pitt, I figured \\"Hollywood\\" couldn't possibly spoil, such an \\"Iron-Clad\\" concept novel.  The Book, So Rich in Detail and Characters on 342 Pages and the same on 5 Audio CDs with \\"A-List Actors\\" speaking the survivors testimony.  It took them over 3-years of compacting/condensing/transposition and the use of CGI to carry this piece of celluloid Dreck to make any money! Brad Pitt Could've/Should've 'phoned-In' his part. I gave this film \\"One\\" star because the list doesn't have a 1/2 star.  I went into the theater, hoping there was some semblance to the book.  I wasted 2 hours & $10 one afternoon to watch a film that should be place beside Ed Woods, \\"Plan 9\\" epic.  Save You money and find another DVD to buy. Avoid this movie like you would the plague!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was good but I didn't consider it the best of the series. Disappointed at the end and hope the movie is better.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|U don't know what to say, This game it's just awesome! I love playing it . Can play it all day and not bored.

015206057X|3.0|Thought this would be a good book for my 18 month old because of the rhyme but it didn't keep my son interested for long...better or young babies or older than 3
159102594X|1.0|Except of exposition, nothing really happens. Actually this is a non plot book. Very disappointing, not even close to be martin books.
1451626096|4.0|Phillippa Gregory is a favorite author of mine, but The White Princess gets a mixed review from me. While I enjoyed the book as a whole, I liked the last 100 pages the best. The book was 522 pages long and could easily have been chopped to 300 pages and it would have lost nothing without all repetitiveness. The story itself is fasinating, and moves quickly towards the end. I think it's funny that one of the comments on the dust jacket back states, &#34;If only grade school history books were written so vividly.&#34; The author's note at the end clearly states the book is fiction about a mystery. In any case, I did enjoy the book, and I recommend it to fans of Gregory.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is awesome. If you like puzzles and challenges this is great!! Can't wait for more levels. Especially if they keep getting harder.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once again Michael Connelly makes me lose sleep with a book I can't put down. Great story and I realize with Harry getting closer to retiring I may have to go back to the first book and start again. Great characters, great plot. Excellent. Highly recommend.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I bought this for a gift so I have not viewed it but my son liked it.  I received it in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered.
B00E25KVLW|4.0|Great book. In spite of some spelling mistakes, the content of the book is great. The examples make easy to understand the theory and it provides a good introduction for people new to Ruby On Rails. Another great thing is that it doesn't use the same examples you find everywhere (Twitter clone or Blog), it uses completely different examples.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting!!  I love it.  It is very easy to lose track of time when playing, and before you know it, your battery is low.
B009FREK3W|5.0|One of the best &#34;best of&#34; collections ever! The recording is pristine.  The songs are classic and awesome.  Jeff Lynn is a genius!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I enjoy all of the songs on this album! I haven't been able to say that about an album in many years. Great addition to my music collection.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game app except for an occasional quitting in the middle of a game annoying that it is otherwise great app.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. It is super cute like the show. Play if you are a my little pony fan. One problem with the game is that the cash shop is expensive.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read the book before, and I still love it!<br />It is funny, well written, good language and fantastic characters.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Lots of great tunes for the money.  Very upbeat and gets you moving!  In perfect condition and I have played it often.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Very intriguing storyline. Lots of twists and sensible ending. Very well made science fiction after a long time. A very good watch.
B007T99ENE|4.0|You can hear the writing tutor behind this book which of course is so well written that he pulls off the female perspective. It's a good read.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|It was a good family movie.  We all enjoyed the movie.<br />Was not expensive when you consider going to the movies with your family.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|\\"mud\\" has many things going for it -- a strong script, great acting, believable and compelling characters, and the foreboding of cottonmouth country. the four subplots (marriage, reunion, revenge and first love) are motivated by the same premise: how a woman can make a man suffer, and where that can lead when love goes bad. each subplot is enriched by various male relationships: father/son, love competitor or mortal enemy, same age buddy or cross generational mentor. there is shadow and light across every relationship and all the characterizations blend as a result of superb casting. the script has a clockwork quality in which every detail has significance in the whole; both the cinematography and sequence editing are technically impressive but shaped to tell the human story. the focus is on relationships in a small southern river town, how the people came to where they are and how they move forward; you're pulled into the story as if you're living it, and this dictates a leisurely pace that is part of the storytelling and that allows you to linger with scenes the way you'd pause over a memorable passage in a novel. i want to alert viewers to the subtle fairytale elements in the film -- a boat in a tree, a lone boy approaching an island forest at night, a damsel in distress standing on a balcony, a sky that fills with birds when a man talks of love, a woman who casts dark spells on men, killers who plot revenge with prayer, two boys performing the quests set for them by a man who appears from nowhere wearing talismans and spinning tales -- these magical elements serve as highlights on the realism and guide our emotional intuitions about the characters. mcconaughey gives an insightful and unsentimental performance as the drifter who struggles to master his past and his passion, tye sheridan is very strong as the boy trying to become a man despite betrayal by those he trusts, and ray mckinnon is deeply affecting as the father trying to salvage his family, home and masculine identity. it's a mark of the high quality of the production that sam shepard and michael shannon accepted relatively minor roles to be a part of it. i loved this film, and i will be very disappointed if it does not get some 2013 best picture nominations.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|OK! I had a long review going, and it was cut off. So instead of going into my review point by point, again, I'll just say save your money on this one. Aslan rehashed, and not very well, others' research. The writing was disjointed, and facts were regurgitated throughout the book. The notes at the back are 25% of the book. If you are still intent on buying the book, just read the notes. Now my main objections are of the constant reminder that all the research was done by \\"scholars\\", and anyone writing in the far past (including Jesus) were ignorant, and could not possibly be relied upon to relate and write facts. What pompous rot. These scholars seem to have been studying all the facts they discuss for centuries, and still can't form any concrete conclusions. As far as the Aslan's writing for this book, in my opinion one would expect more from a leading biblical \\"scholar\\".  Enough said.
B006S01GH2|4.0|I wonder if Amelie represents the French as good as Laurel & Hardy and The Three Stooges represented life in America?
B00992CF6W|5.0|Totally worth it this game has everything. A world to play, creativity, smarts, survival and challenges though I wish the servers will be up soon and not cost much if as if it was $0.99 over all great set game keep it up Mojang
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest, and this app makes it easy to take your favorite recipes anywhere.  I don't know how I did with out it for so long.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|App does what it advertises in the description. Other than that I have not had any problems with this apps functions.
B003XWFLTM|5.0|I am a huge fan of classical music, and Tchaikovsky is my favorite composer by far.  I have several versions of all his symphonies.  This boxed set is uniformly spectacular.  The sound is very crisp, and apparently the Russian National Orchestra loves to emphasize the brass--which is just right for Tchaikovsky's bombastic scores.  This 7-CD set not only includes &#34;Manfred&#34;, but also the other orchestral masterworks--Marche Slav, Romeo and Juliet, Capriccio Italienne, the lesser-known Hamlet, Fate, Voyevode, and so on.  The price for these 7 CDs cannot be beat.  If that weren't enough, this box set's version of 1812 Overture is sensational; the cannon effects will blow your mind!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Decent movie, Special effects make the movie, I bet it was a simple quick movie for the director and actors to shot. Due to Special effects carry the movie. Overall entertaining but dont get  hyped up for something special. I compare this movie to World War Z . High Actor Name use. For a big hype plot, but  bland movie. Kinda a quick easy buck made.  Two steps up from Prothesis movie, on plot, but one step back on special effects or a near tie..  All the BIGG reviews saying it has flavor of planet of the apes. Ehhh more like Hal the robot in full control.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I watched this last night and I found it dull and hard to follow.  Obviously good special effects, and Tom Cruise does his usual job in action movies, scrapy, taking risks, and seemingly able to handle falls and explosions that would decimate the rest of us.  However, I wouldn't recommend renting this for $4.99.
B007HVBW2A|4.0|Reviewed as had seen this many Years ago.  Wanted to see the modern redo. Worth while.  Actors were very good.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Sorry, but Tom Cruise is the wrong person to play Jack Reacher.  I will stick to the books which are real thrillers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft you build awesome stuff in creative and get your own resources in survival realms is awesome or version or is down shorted on stuff and really want wonderment but perhaps is still lots of fun so I recommend it so buy this game
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This was a great cast and a wonderful movie.  I am sorry I didn't get to see it in the theater, but this was terrific for history buffs.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a great book.  Loved the characters and story.  Could not put it down. Would highly recommend to everyone.
B00CPTUNBK|1.0|You cannot use this digital download with iTunes.  My kids download this from their computer 2 time and it states we have reached they maximum number of downloads.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I really like Matthew McConaughey who did a great job with this movie but I especially like the two boys who were featured in the movie, Reese Witherspoon not so much.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Ienjoyed the storyline of this series.  I am looking forward to finding out about the further adventures of Jack.  I did think the games have gotten a bit repetitious.  I hope the next one has more variety.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|need to use it a bit more for now its just a OK application and as time goes on I should be able to see if its allot better than  most
B001H9MYPW|4.0|Series 2 improves on the strong reputation In Treatment established in the first series. The acting is superb and the script remains authentic, if the plot occasionally takes unlikely turns. Why most patients pay good money for help that they do their best to ignore and belittle tests belief. The show's biggest weakness remains Paul's ongoing improbable regression to puerile tantrums with Gina, his own therapist and former supervisor and mentor. Still, this is adult entertainment and beats the heck out of most of what appears on the box.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Was only going to play one or two games, now 2 hours later cant seem to stop :)  THIS GAME IS SOO ADDICTIVE.  My granddaughter will love this too!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not enough info relating to the out of life experience.  Did not explain enough what was felt.  Does the author really believe in the afterlife.
1582701709|5.0|I absolutely love this book.<br />I love so much I bought 10 of them for people I love. Family & Friends with a pack of Highlighters.<br />You can not go wrong with this book!!!<br />Thank you Rhonda Byrne!!!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bruno Mars may seem cocky and arrogant, but both of his albums are good enough to make me forget it. I feel every song on this album when I listen to it, which is quite often, and that's coming from a country/rocker girl. Do yourself a favor and listen to this! It's worth it.
B009GEH5NG|4.0|Great film. Re imagined the character for the post cold war era. Brosnan leaves his mark on the 007 style and wit.
0761169253|5.0|You may not agree with every little snip-it in this book, but the overall gist is inspiring. This helped me feel comfortable with the way I get my inspiration for my writing as well as helping me figure out where to pull inspiration when I'm feeling stuck. It's a great read.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|PSB have never had a bad album and Electric is in track for the dance floor! Vocal is now an all-time favorite!
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|I'm not BVB's typical teenage fan. I'm older than the majority of the band, but I've got to say, they give me hope for rock & roll. This album is miles ahead of the first and they just keep getting better and better. Don't let the hoards of young, emo fans scare you away. This band is legit and this album is kickass!
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing! I love Leonardo DiCaprio. I could watch it over and over again. Definitely worth buying!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I've been a Justin Timberlake fan for as long as I can remember. I was an *Nsyncer in my teeny-bopping days, and I feel like I've grown up with him, but this album shows me that we've grown in different directions. It was a long wait, so perhaps I was too excited, but this was a bit of a let down. (And geeze that is hard to admit!) I'm really hoping that the second half of this is better.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Books were so complex that I would like to read the entire series again. It is amazing how all of the detailed plot lines were woven together in the end. A must read!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This album is exactly what I expected from him and that's saying something because I had high expectations! He is certainly one of the most talented musicians to come off of American Idol, but that show has had a tendency to take the winners and ruin them by not allowing them to put their personality into their music. This album feels like it's who Phillip Phillips really is. Nothing is perfect, which is why I only gave it four stars, but it is definitely worth the listen. I have a feeling this is just the beginning.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Its fun but I have a feeling its gonna get harder needing you to spend money to get help to complete levels
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Bon Jovi is my favorite band, ever. (I have no hesitation in making that statement!) But I'm trying my hardest not to be biased when I say that this is one of the best albums of the year. Bon Jovi's music has changed with the times, but it's only gotten better .They've taken a stance on a lot of issues and they're not afraid to tell you what they think. They did it on The Circle and they've done it again on What About Now. I love seeing them stick up for the little guy. Don't let the current feud fool you. This album is as good as ever and it's 100% worth it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever. It has romance,action,and betrayal. I highly recommend<br /> it to anyone who loves books or movies.
B00BHASVEO|2.0|The first season was pretty good. There were some changes from the book, but the story still flowed. Season two is just getting on my nerves! The changes made are absolutely ridiculous. The Jon Snow and Ygritte scenario made me stop watching and I'm not sure if I can continue. I sorta wish I didn't read the books because then maybe I would enjoy this series more.<br /><br />The actor and character of Theon's sister is atrocious. The story of Daenerys is horrible. The battle between the Kings guard and the Black recruits was way underplayed, and the flow of Arya's journey was cut and changed way too much. I could go on and on. I know I should expect changes, but this was written and directed as if both writer and director did not read and love the books. And I truly don't understand how the ratings are high from people who did read the books.<br /><br />Well, finished watching, finally. I'm totally disgusted. I just have no words to say how bad it is. A bitter disappointment. There is no magic whatsoever, like there is in the book. None.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This writer is amazing, it was funny,  emotional and captivating. Absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend this book. See is an amazing character.

B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is one of the better games I've played on my Kindle Fire, great graphics and easy game not alot of stuff to learn about playing so if you enjoy any action rpg games this one is highly recommended.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|With \\"Eye of the Needle\\" Ken Follett has written one of the best WW2 spy thrillers. In 1944 the most vital information on the outcome of the war was the location of the invasion of France - information that could fundamentally change the outcome of the war. The location of the landings in Normandy was closest kept secret with MI5 implementing the most amazing misinformation campaign in history.<br /><br />By 1944 MI5 had caught and executed most German spies, but was able to turn some into double agents sending misleading information back to Germany. There was one ruthless agent - nickname \\"The Needle\\" (Die Nadel) - who was able to elude capture for years. What was even more important was that Adolf Hitler knew him and trusted everything that he sent back to Germany and was waiting for his report about where the landings would take place.<br /><br />Follett creates a wide range of memorable characters, including the cold blooded Die Nadel. An absent minded Professor becomes head of MI5 strategy of disinformation, helped by his Scotland Yard assistant whose wife was killed in the Blitz. A young Spitfire pilot who loses his legs in a car accident on his honeymoon ends up in a loveless marriage hiding from the war on a remote island off the coast of Scotland.<br /><br />Follett sets up an exciting chase when Die Nadel tries to escape with the information Hitler needs. The plot surprisingly shifts focus at the end from a spy thriller to a unexpected lusty romance with a chilling ending.<br /><br />This tale is not only exciting but also plausible (see Mark Black's [[ASIN:B00BCHAA8M D-Day: A Very Brief History]]), with vivid details about life in the United Kingdom during the War. It was an enthralling and electrifying story (you must read the ending to really understand what I mean).<br /><br />While reading this book I kept comparing it with Jack Higgins [[ASIN:B00A86LPAK Night of the Fox]] which is also based on the secrecy of the location of the D Day landings. The stories have completely different angles and my comparative rating is a dead-heat.<br /><br />See over 200 Suncoast Reviews with full author index - [...]tories have completely different angles and my comparative rating is a dead-heat.<br /><br />See over 200 Suncoast Reviews with full author index - [...]
B008Y73940|4.0|The movie's star has played a number of lawyers over the years and this is one of his better works.  He has a good plot to work with.  Marisa Tomei as his ex-wife is also good.  The final plot twist was somewhat predictable, but it's a good yarn and fun to follow.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Great overall album although a few of the songs don't meet the standard set by the rest.  Additionally, the album flows pretty well listening to it straight through but I feel like the middle of the albums drops the ball - they go from a funky, disco pop beat into a Pink Floyd-esq track and immediately follow that up with another funky, disco-pop beat.  It's....jarring.
B00CLILB66|4.0|This movie was charming and had a raft of well-known, good actors, but the plot was a trifle lightweight.  The best thing about the movie was the presence of retired musicians who played and sang through the movie.  That part speaks volumes about the human tendency to dismiss older people, a message we would do well to heed.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you want to watch the Game of Thrones you must see the first season to understand how it all started. I started with season two and did not know who people were talking about. Love this show
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Loved this as well as her previous book, &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34;  Good mix of period descriptions, moving back and forth in time and a blend of mystery
0812993845|1.0|I wish I had read reviews on this book before wasting my money.  It's the first book of Sophie Kinsella's that I literally skipped tons of pages just to be finished with it.  I have nothing positive to say about it.  I have loved every other book by her, but this one just stunk IMO
B003730LRY|4.0|A modern twist that stays true to the original while being fresh and fun. You can never go wrong with Christopher Lloyd.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  I can play it alone or with my 5 yr old niece.  I Ak hooked!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have nothing to say but good job gameloft fun game and addicting. I can not stop playing it thanks.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I am not sure I get this one.  I do get that you touch groups of three or more, but I am not getting how to move ahead in levels, or get bonus points or whatever.  It seems I just run out of time and that's it.  Maybe it will grow on me as I get quicker.
B008602KQI|3.0|Fun to see the vision on the screen, but felt that as (mostly) always, lots of stuff is left on the cutting room floor. Still worth a look.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This seems like a pretty good game, once I get the hang of it.  Right now, I just get eaten !  I need to master the onscreen joystick, as I was familiar with a real one !  It will be fun since it is a challenge.
B007M45PMU|3.0|.. but very listenable. Loved their Colbert interview. Ho Hey (or is it Hey Ho) caught my ear, but I breeze through most of the other tracks.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone, but it is not as &#34;predictable,&#34; as someone else had stated. It is just enough to keep you trying to figure it all out. I did not want to rent it for $5 originally, but now that I have I will have no hesitation buying this from Amazon. I loved this movie; connects with action, mystery, and surprisingly an enduring love. Tom Cruse's character has an awesome job on earth, thrill seekers would be envious. I joked to my husband about it being Maverick's futuristic Top Gun look (on his &#34;dirt&#34; bike). And Rating wise, it is decent enough for an action adventure move.
B007DIQC90|4.0|.. the entire album is quite listenable. &#34;Little Talks&#34; and &#34;Mountain Sound&#34; being where I started (thanks SNL). Love reading up on the fan bits on the web. They appear in the genre of 'alternative', but I think of them more as folk rock. Great lyrics!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Baby loves it. We attached it to his car seat and he doesn't seem to be bored of it even after seeing it every time he goes on a car ride. He is 6 months old.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|You don't have to be a child of the 80's to get all of the references here, but it didn't hurt.  I loved the characters and their growth through the story, and hope to read Mr. Cline's next book soon!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This unit is exactly what I wanted. It does everything in a simple and straight forwarded manner. Easy to operate, easy to clear.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|England, Estate, WWI, BBC - How can you go wrong? &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; on genteel steroids.  Multiple love stories, English classes structure shows its seams in this chapter of a dramatic production.
B001I45UFC|5.0|My only question is if one can't get to Narnia by the same route twice why is it that Lucy and Edmund did?
0765324857|5.0|My son requested this book for his birthday as it is a video game he has previously played & was interested in reading the story line.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good story, fast paced, easy to read. Not a Pulitzer, but a great book on vacation. I really enjoyed it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This box set was a huge value for the money I paid for it.  Movies are all in pristine condition and sound wonderful on my surround system.  These movies are definite repeat watches for sure!
B000SW2F80|5.0|Any Stephen King fan and even any Alfred Hitchcock fan is sure to love this movie.  The horror mixture with comedy is excellent.  Hal Holbrook, Ted Danson, Leslie Nielsen and Bridgette Bordeaux are all entertaining in this classic horror film.  A pleasure from beginning to end!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game sooooo addictive! i am never board with this app!!!!great for kids too!!! love it! AWESOME !?
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I loved every page. Jeff Kinney somehow managed a second book even better than his first. He should be a inspiration to all graphic novel writers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book!!!!!! I don't know how anyone can not like it! I just finished reading it for the second time!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The levels were not incredibly hard but they had enough of a challenge to keep my interest. I enjoyed the set up of each stage along with the color and number memorization
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show, unfortunately, all of the shows I like seem to keep getting cancelled.  Did I say I like this show?  Oops, I mean I hate it,  bring on some more ghost hunting shows, those are great!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|This small amp is easy to use and improves volume sent to my bluetooth transmitter. For those with large fingers controlling volume, etc, could prove slightly difficult.
B008602KQI|1.0|Not a good movie. Bunch of 12 to 18 year-old kids in the woods killing each other. Obvious that the older ones with \\"some\\" fighting skills would win. The love had no progress, just happened. It sucked.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is tons of fun.  Love the game.  I love the graphics and the tilt function.  Glad I downloaded this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movie and this game adds the best of the movie all in one game!!! It is a bit frustrating to have to start from the beginning each time. I guess that is my only negative.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Yes, I gave this five stars, even though I wanted part 2 to follow immediately.  The Hogwarts friends are of age now and can use their powers to fight for their school, their families, and their world.  There are plenty of plot twists, great special effects, stirring music, and action.  It is darker and more potentially frightening to younger kids, though, so watch it with them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had never watched Downton Abbey, but had heard so much about it. I have Amazon Prime, so I started with Season 1, Episode 1 and am watching episodes in airports, motels, in bed, on the porch. Love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app was great.  It was addictive and challenging.  However needs more instructions to explain game.  It could use a hint feature in a level or two.  Overall it was very fun!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Drama, intrigue, suspense, a great cast, great acting, and a great plot twister.... Dexter is a source for excellent entertainment.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|until now.  once i started, i couldn't stop: it's a real page turner.  at times poetic and charming it is such a cleverly crafted story it begs you to stay up all night reading.  just read it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show! I had to slow misled down from gobbling up all three seasons at once. I can't wait for season 4.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Typical Hidden object game, but it gets a little difficult trying to find the bonus cards on several levels. Don't like having to keep paying to unlock more levels.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|good beach/travel read.  Not DeMille's best, but good, nonetheless. Will keep reading DeMille in all his variations.  His characters always entertain.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put it down, lost too much sleep this week since stayed up to read. :). A few missing details would have pulled story together better, but overall, really enjoyed it!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|THE GIVER  presents the idea of a utopian society and the challenges of people within that community in an excellent way.  My middle school students easily relate to the challenges and emotions of Jonas, the twelve year old main character.  This book is a great motivator for discussions and deep thoughts.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|What can I say? Facebook is Facebook. I'm not a big user of the site, but it seems to work well on the Fire HD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a wonderful series the whole family can watch together.  Thank you for having faith in your audience to appreciate it.  Each season is just as rewarding as the first.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Well, I guess the biggest problem is with the Kindle HD itself, in that it is only a &#34;back-facing&#34; camera. What it needs is a simple view-finder on the back of the Kindle so you could see what you were photographing in front of you. It works great for Skype video calling. The best feature of the app seems to be the time-delay-shutter feature. I think, however, that it is not really fair to expect the KHD Fire to possess ALL the features of every tablet out there. As a reader of books, viewer of video content, web browser, and even music player, it does a great job.  So if it is not the best camera, I can forgive it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is simply amazing.  Emma Watson is adorable and the other actors involved definitely have a bright future ahead of them.  If you ever suffered through awkward teen years then you will enjoy this movie.
B009EE0SC8|4.0|Lots of action and worth the watch! Probably more of a guys flick but I would recommend it to anyone!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Can't get enough of this.  We love this game. Very addicting. Hope more fb friends will play soon. And will have to check if I can play in Facebook too...
B00000K3D4|5.0|I remember seeing this movie as a child. I ordered it for our children and they love it and have watched it several times now.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|my wife has to change her under wear every time we watch the show. I LOVE WALKING DEAD. . .
B008N1LL42|5.0|Once the action started, it was non-stop until the end and that is the kind of action movies that I like. I must have watched battleship at least twelve times and counting. One of those movies you just never get tired of.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|This funny action packed movie made you laugh and always had a twist to the plot. This is one of those movies that makes you want to be a super hero too. I recommend this to any one that likes action or to laugh.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|enjoyed watching the movie and even more that we could rewind and watch the parts we were not clear on
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I found this game to be creative and  fun. The scenery and obstacles changed making this a game I wanted to continue to play.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book won't magically change your life. If you are the kind of person who is drawn to articles in magazines that outline detailed eating and exercise plans then you are going to have a hard time with this. Not that a detailed eating and exercise plan is totally worthless! It could be the change of routine that helps you get started.<br /><br />For example, some people complained about the section on corporate habits. But if you skip that section you miss the concept of keystone habits which can easily be applied to personal habits. Others complained about the section on how Febreze was marketed but it's a powerful example of how important rewards are. I personally thought that showing how these concepts work both in individuals and groups made the book more interesting.<br /><br />What this book does offer is an excellent exploration of concepts and research. YOU have to figure out how to apply the concepts to your own life.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Great at making it so I can't hear anything else when I'm listening to and is very comfortable on my ears.
1612680011|5.0|This book made ​​me think in a whole new way of money.<br />Now I purchased Cashflow Quadrant and Rich dad's guide to investing!<br />Thanks Robert
B009NY43NY|1.0|What a horrible end for Sookie and us the readers!!!!!  What a complete let down.  I wasted my money and years of my life to get this \\"happy ending\\"?  I'm disappointed and disgusted.  If I could have thrown my kindle across the room and not regret it later I would have!  I won't spend another cent on this author.  Good riddance.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Haven't had it long enough to really go through everything, but at least I feel like I have some control over the background stuff that's slowing my tablet down. Got rid of a whole load of file fragments and am working on getting rid of some platform stuff that I was afraid to get rid of without wiping something I'd regret (I've made that mistake before and lost some valuable stuff)  The Cleaner has already made everything faster, and has stopped some conflicting apps from killing time. I'd been wanting a cleaner for some time now...so far this has really been working well. I have been Leary about cleaners because of all the stories of cleaners being a disguise for some viruses or spyware. But I trust the Big A. And so far I would recommend this product to anyone that's having ...weird stuff going on with their device, or a slowing of performance...It keeps shaving off wasted space every time I find time to fiddle with it.  My phone is new and there wasn't a lot to clean on it, but my tablet has been around long enough that it needed some maintenance, and its really doing well...I will update and maybe give The Cleaner a five star NOTE* been using it a week. EVERYTHING'S FASTER..it politely asks if I want it to do whatever needs to be Done. Explains why. Then does it! Saved 38k on my tablet...very glad I went ahead and listened to good advice and got THE BEST cleaner
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this game to occupy my little cousins so they wouldn't fight so much...but I ended up liking it so much I just started playing whenever
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Very exciting. Like being a kid in the circus again, surrounded by mystery, magic and your imagination. I was Intrigued through the whole book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My sister-in-law got me hooked on this game.  So when I got the chance, I bought it.  Highly addictive, but lots of fun.<br />Mknewsom
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I do like this app on my kindle fire and the fish eye effect you can make, the lomo and colors. You can add text as well. The pic shop cam has the rotating effects and other features this one doesn't so if they could combine the two into this one and send faster it would be a five. The pics get stored in the camera folder.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I use this game when I wish to center myself and think.  It is very relaxing and mildly challenging at the same time. I would recommend it for some simple fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and entertaining game that everyone should enjoy.<br />I only wish that I could save the New York version. It's my favorite.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Totally worth it.  Kept me guessing and busy all day.  Good distraction and when you are stuck you get helpful hits.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|It's a very interesting story for people interested in Katy Perry and her career.  Also fun to see the high-energy performances,
0063120046|5.0|Colleen McCullough reveals the passions that can be fought and found in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, even back in the early to mid 1900's.  Australia is the dramatic background for this strong human tale which encompasses the gamut of life's possibilities of trials and tribulations.<br />I have had several copies of this book, wearing out for multiple reads.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A delightful read. Gives great insight into the quirky world of Asperger's syndrome without labouring the point. Is compassionate to those involved in the drama of the  situation
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|My 5 year old niece loves monster high dolls, but her parents think they are too creepy...These dolls were great middle ground since they are not creepy, but still have the monster high fun feel.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time.  I have purchased it in hardcover, worn that out, then in softcover, loaned it out and lost it, then bought again.  I finally ended up getting the Kindle version as I wanted to be able to read it when on vacation or waiting for an appointment/in line/etc.  I love the characterization and the pacing, and the story feels free every time through.  Highly recommended if you are even a slight fan of Gaiman or Pratchett.  And if you aren't a fan yet, try the book.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I have played many variations of this game but I find this one is a great one to relax to. It can be challenging but also doesn't require one to be an experienced player to do well.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Only one complaint: you can download the episodes in HD so why no blu-ray release ? After viewing the first 2 episodes I immedialy ordered season 2 and pre-ordered season 3.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love mystery novels. This is a good book as it takes you through a murder investigation and trial and the support the suspect had from his family. At times I thought I had it all figured out only to be surprised later on. Good book. I would recommend it to any reader.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Immersive gameplay, tricky puzzles, perfect soundtrack, amazing visuals, unbelievable atmosphere! You'll give fully satisfied with this brilliant game - really a masterpiece, built with love and tenderness!!!
B004SEUJK0|4.0|Fun movie and was great for a girls night in.  Although everyone had seen it, it has been awhile since it was in the local theatres and although it was remembered, it was still charming
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app and check it every day.  I travel so I check the area that I all be traveling to and then have an idea of what to pack.  Weather is unpredictable but the weather channel gives me an idea of what to expect! I would highly recommend this app.
B0000UI2QY|1.0|It would not play.  I thought I was doing something wrong and waited until my Son had to time to help me.  He could not get it to work either.  The product is defective.  I will gladly return it, but I really would like a copy that works.  It's sweet funny little movie and I would like to add it to my library.  I have contacted Amazon....but have received no response
B001EC2ISA|5.0|So much fun!  I would recommend for someone who wants to just enjoy a movie.  It's alot of fun!  Watch!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Im so happy app was free i love playing this game when younger but nobody wants to play anymore so im glad i found this app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We go this mostly for our grandchildren to play and we actually loved it as much as they did.  There was a little struggle as to who would be the next one to play it.  It's nice to be able to entertain them without spending money for a change.
B00BLSJI80|4.0|i love every single song in this album and im a really big fan of demi.. i gave this product 4 stars because i only downloaded the songs on my phone and then i never used the cd again.. honestly i just bought it because i like collecting demi's albums and i got  it really fast.. i recommend this product to everyone because all the songs are AMAZING especially warrior its my fav track!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can not wait for the new levels. Lots of fun. It is easy enough to figure out and challenging enough to make you work at it.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Perhaps it's just the observations of a man approaching middle age, but more than I can ever recall in my lifetime, music has begun to feel like a cheap, disposable commodity in our more convenient internet-driven world. With this in mind, I found this documentary among the best musical documentaries I've seen. Directed by former Nirvana drummer and current Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, Sound City begins as an exploration of the famous Van Nuys studio and its resident one-of-a-kind sound board and evolves into a reflective look at the role of human interaction in music and the effect accessibility and technology have had on this.<br /><br />The first half of the documentary is interesting for those who aren't familiar with the Sound City story and its analog-world Neve Console soundboard. While never diving into enough detail to satisfy the more technically-inclined, the documentary does present a nice montage of conversations with the likes of Stevie Nicks, Neil Young and even Rick Springfield on how the unique working atmosphere and engineering of Sound City not only effected their sound, but had a part in driving the feel of a generation of rock music. As the digital age ascended, the film shifts into the effect cheaper and more accessible technology has had not only on the Sound City studio, but also the process of recording and making music in general. This is best exemplified in a recording session Grohl put together for the film including several legendary musical names. The musical careers of these men and women are all very much established at this point, but we still see through snippets of these sessions the basic passion of the people that had yet to build egos to protect or brands to market, but loved music and loved making music together.<br /><br />In the modern world, one person can sit at a computer and piece and pick out nearly any sound, rhythm or style they desire. While this has in theory opened up a new universe of creative possibility, there is a sense of the sacred that seems to have been lost in music. As the cliche image of a starving group of musicians hauling gear into a shabby recording studio is replaced with the bedroom and computer, what has been lost? Sound City takes a stab at the question and seeing the heartfelt passion many of these aging musicians have for simply making music TOGETHER is worth every minute of the show.
B005XUC398|5.0|The setting for this movie hardly moves away from the offices, but the acting is so riveting that it doesn't matter. The events sometimes are left unanswered as to how something could happen but we probably wouldn't understand it anyway. Kevin Spacey, as usual, will convince you that he is the best actor in the industry and is highly underrated!
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|There's nothing new under the sun, was all I could think about whale reading this book. The lies and know nothing attitudes we see coming from the right these days equally rampant in the run up to WWII, especially from the isolationists. There's not going to be a war in Europe said one isolationist senator. Many others believed Britain had already lost to Germany, so why bother? The demographics of the isolationists movement are remarkably similar to the Tea Party movement today. The book also reveals FDR's indecision on many important actions prior to Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />Upon reflection, I want to add two other items. One is the author's belief that FDR actually did not want to lead the nation in coming to Britain's aid but let public opinion lead him. The second is that the book is very much about Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Ann. Lindbergh is revealed as stubborn and opinionated and a philanderer who often left his family for weeks at a time with no communication.<br /><br />All in all, a very well done and insightful look at that period in our country's history.
B004W2V254|5.0|Highly recommend this one! Excellent production quality; great story telling with tension, drama, and adventure; beautiful cinematography, and fantastic acting!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm definitely an amateur photographer, but this flash clearly improves the quality of indoor photos - flesh tones look more natural than with the on-board camera flash (on my Nikon D5200).<br /><br />In my view, the purchase is worth it if you plan to take indoor photos in poor light conditions.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|The best Michael Buble disc I have heard! I bought another one for my daughter and her husband! Great songs presented with first-class performances and production quality!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book just like the first one. I would say it is more romantic than the first!! I really liked it!!!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|loved the item was just as described would buy again
B002PJN59M|5.0|The best by far of all the Arthurian legends. Helen Mirren and Nicol Williamson are spectacular. Byrne, Neeson, Stewart are perfect.<br />The score is inspired. The use of Siegfried's March is genius.<br />Thank you, John Boorman!!!!
B006KP3XCQ|5.0|best price and fast shipping just as described
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't think I would like this whole series, but I instant fell in love w/Anna & Christin I recommended it to all of my friends,
B005LAII3A|5.0|best price and fast shipping just as described
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I think it was well written and couldn't wait to get to the book each night.  I didn't expect the outcome and strongly disagree with suicide as an option.  If it weren't for that, I would have given it 5 stars. I had great compassion for Will and Louisa.  If God had been an important part of their lives the outcome would have been different.
B002WY65VU|5.0|GOOD Movie just as described and condition
1400095204|5.0|I had this as an assignment for our English Literature class this summer. At first I thought it would be boring, at first it was but then it picked up and I couldn't stop reading. It was a new learning experience about Nigeria and even about a Civil I didn't know happened in the 1960's. I read this book in one day and I absolutely fell in love with it. Changing perspective keeps the story fresh as it's not always with the same character. Adichie really made this to be an amazing book with love, war, sex are all tied in and there are surprises at every corner. Even the ending made me want to have a sequel to this story and I'm dying to know what happened with X. This is a must read book no matter what age you are!
B0090EHVMC|4.0|best price and fast shipping just as described
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book was amazing.  I read the entire thing in one day because I found it so fascinating.  I wish it had been longer, as there is so little information out there about North Korea.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I started this after I began watching the Netflix show. In this single case, the book is not as compelling as the show. On the other hand, I learned here what Piper was thinking, which I don't think ou see on the show. It was inteersting to understand what goes on in a minimum security prison. The book held my interest for the time I read it, but I'm not going to recommend it to anyone.

B00AEFXV3E|5.0|`The Elephant Man' is David Lynch's most humane movie. But, its humanity depends only on the initiative and the unselfishness of ONE man, played sublimely by Anthony Hopkins. This doctor faced stubbornly the denigration, the jealousy or the pure misunderstanding by his colleagues, thereby risking his reputation and even his job.<br />The `Elephant Man' is physically a horrendously `painted bird', whose deformed features are cynically exploited by `businessmen'. Being `abnormal', he is hounded by racists and fiercely attacked by the mob. Psychologically, however, he himself is the most generous of men.<br />Of course, this movie doesn't brush a very `bright' picture of mankind. Its harsh and violent scenes are nearly unbearable and go straight to the heart of a `conscious' spectator.<br />`The Elephant Man' is a horror movie, but not in the normal sense. The horror doesn't come from a seriously misshapen man, but from his treatment by his `fellow-creatures' and their barbaric slogan: individuals who are not normal have to be slaughtered.<br />A must see.

B00005ASOC|5.0|I've seen many of Connery's films, but until today, I'd never seen this one. I loved him in Hunt for Red October and of course the Bond Films, but for me, this one is his crowning achievement.<br /><br />If you're an aspiring writer, watch it! If you're a fan of basketball, a must see and if you want a film where the young and the old teach each other the lessons of life, than by all means, watch it. You won't be disappointed.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game itself works fine, but there's no icon for you to end a game .... only an icon for a new deal.  That's annoying.  And at the start of each new deal you are presented for an ad (with no option to pay something to go ad free) and to make matters worse, the ad hangs up - there's rarely a &#34;skip&#34; icon or an &#34;x&#34; or any other way to rid yourself of it - nothing can be swiped up from the bottom or from the top with options to make it go away - so it just stays there until you actually exit the application, then re-enter the application, at which point the game begins from where it should have, in the first place.  When you consider that, for an experienced player, this happens about every 3 minutes ... well, you can see how annoying it becomes.  Oh, I have an early edition Kindle Fire.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Macro lenses are really expensive and, although this lens does not provide the same level of versatility and quality a true Macro lens provide, it is a nice &#60;$100 option if you are just getting your feet wet in Macro photography.<br /><br />The most important feature of a lens is the image quality it produces. The  2-group/3-element composition along with the coated optical glass elements makes for clean and razor sharp images comparable to some macro lenses. Take into account however, that this lens produce an extremely shallow depth of field and the focus will be limited to a very narrow area (even at small apertures).
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a most unusual story. Very thought-provoking. Harold's journey and his emotions and those of his wife took me down unexpected paths and led to very moving discoveries.Also, I had an introduction to England's landscape as well. Good read, indeed!

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|His characters--especially Jack Ryan and all his buddies-- are believable,  The story line moves along well and the characters are introduced and woven in nicely.  With the problems the world is having with hackers it makes one even more concerned that perhaps the events depicted could occur on a smaller scale.  The only drawback is Clancy's penchant for detail.

You have to be in the mood for tragedy when you pick this one up, folks. By the second half of the book I couldn't put it down. I loved every character & am not ashamed to say I wept over losing most of the them.

B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|This is the sorta genre I'm not suppose to like or at least what my musical taste would dictate. Nonetheless, there's just something about this album I really like. Either that or it's LDR style I like. She' s different so perhaps that's what captivated my interest.Yet, somehow I'm a fan, there' s this ineffable  essence about her music that I find rather intriguing.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|For me, it was like being there.  It was like I knew what the plan was, it was exciting and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Well told story of faith and brotherhood. No true American will be able to finish reading this story without getting emotional.
140006922X|5.0|Let\\"s face it. Theologians and religious historians will never get along. I am reminded of a scene in Clifford Simaks' clever time travel novel, Mastodonia. The inventor of a patented method of time travel is met by a rabbi, a priest, and a Protestant minister who wants to buy the exclusive rights of travel to the time of Jesus Christ. The inventor says, \\"That's wonderful. You three can go back and find out the truth about Jesus.\\" But the three have other plans. They want to totally close off time travel to that period. For them, and for the faith of their followers, it was better not to know. In this area, the three leaders of the these religions agreed that ignorance is best.<br /><br />When it comes to the \\"real world's\\" search for the historical Jesus. I think there is a similar form of friction involved. A lot of people simply do not want to read historical facts especially if it conflicts with their faith. Aslan is bound to have to confront asinine interviews like the now notorious one he was subjected to at Fox News. I'm sure evangelists are already gearing up the cottage industry of rebuking the points of Zealot now that it is a best selling book. But hopefully cooler heads will prevail as people read this book and examine Aslan's evidence for his claims about Jesus.<br /><br />But they are not really his claims. Aslan presents no earth-shaking revelations and no new information that has not been dug up by historians before. Where the author excels is taking all this information about the time of Jesus and presenting in a coherent, detailed and very entertaining format. Aslan researches the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth, a Jew living in a time where Rome rules over Jewish territories, and rules often cruelly. It is a time when prophets claiming to be the Messiah abound and the religious hierarchy is often corrupt. Jesus is one the men claiming to be the Messiah, yet the author shows where his message differs and how his followers changed that message after his death. The main point here, and the one that is going to rile up the faithful is that Jesus is portrayed as not only Jewish (no big surprise there) but one of the Zealot teachers who preached the return of Jewish rule and an earthly \\"Kingdom of God\\", not one in the hereafter. Christianity actually arrives about 50 years after his death when Paul redesigns it into a religion for Gentiles and not the exclusive Jewish message that Jesus and the apostles originally meant it to be.<br /><br />Aslan's real triumph isn't his claims about Jesus but how well he enacts the place and time that all this took place. For a non-fiction work of this kind, it is the most easily read and most engrossing one that I've experienced. It really comes alive as he describes the cultural, religious and political environments. Both minor and major characters are dealt with in amazing care and details. And I think this is where Aslan really helps us understand. Placing the actions of Jesus, Paul, the apostles, Herod, Pilate and the rest of the cast firmly in context with the historical reality helps us understand what was really happening.<br /><br />But if you are dealing with events that are only documented in Gospels which were not written by their namesakes and written 70 to 100 years after the fact, you have to make some judicial assumptions. Aslan uses other writings of the time to evaluate what is myth and what is fact. In some cases, he shows how certain events could not happen due to what we know historically; for instance The slaughtering of children by Herod after Jesus' birth that has no basis in fact as Herod the Great's history was highly documented by contemporary historians and no such event is recorded to have happened or the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem in which most scholars agree he was actually born in Nazareth and the story of his birth in Bethlehem was placed to justify certain aspects of the Messiah prophecy. But other times, Aslan discredits events, such as theresurrection, as being \\"Faith events\\" and not one of historical relevance for study. Of course, this is where people of faith will protest most and use aspects of Aslan's own upbringing to discredit him as we have seen in the fore-mentioned Fox interview. Yet what it should come down to is whether the author's own research is credible and validated. Aslan's research does hold up extremely well with what I've already known yet he also gave me a lot of facts I was not familiar with and did it in a way that kept me guessing as if this was an exciting suspense tale; the perfect combination of historical research and narration.<br /><br />What it really comes down to, as you read this excellent book, is that you will accept or not accept it based on your own ability to have an open mind and to question your own beliefs and assumptions. And that's fine. What a person will do with the insight in this book is totally up to the individual. But it is an important book to read and I cannot recommend it too highly for persons of all faiths...or none.
B00005R24K|5.0|Bruce Campbell found his niche when this movie and it's two sequels were made. I had lost my copy of this movie (VHS) years ago, and a conversation with a friend had me find and order all three. I don't regret the purchase as they made still get a laugh out of me.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|The iTTL of camera is just perfect and so ease of use using the camera popup flash as commander, even with HighSync/AutoFP (the camera flash needs to be on commander only, not flash also since it will give a max of 1/250, but as commander mode you can go to any shutter speed).<br /><br />No more need of triggers, light tests/measures... it simply works, and from camera I can adjust flash compensation from the menu.<br /><br />Previously I used Yongnuo flashes which are very good, cheap, but no TTL off camera. A pity I can't use them in optical mode with CLS/SB700 since the pre flashes trigger them and don't fire in the actual shot.<br /><br />PS: I'm using it with the Nikon D600.

B008MM9630|5.0|This game is so fun I almost got upset when my battery died and I couldn't play anymore! It is so cool I almost never play any other games.  The only thing that is bad about the game is that you have to have a Facebook Account to have friends in the game and slot of the stuff is unlocked by goal s that involves being connected and it takes a little while to get hooked to but once you get going you can't stop!!!!!!!!
B004N622EY|4.0|I like character development, and perhaps it's because I only read in short bursts as time allows, but it does seem to be taking longer to get into than other Sanderson books.<br /><br />Still, its a good story and, as is often the case with Sando, it has an interestingly novel spin on &#34;magic&#34;.

An easy read<br />that might have you rooting for both the author and England's most famous cat:  Bob.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For starters this is brand new equipment with all of the associated opportunities and challenges that come with something new. You better pay careful attention to the supported operating systems because Chromecast will not play well with older systems and the iphone app is not yet available regardless of whether or not you have iOS6 or higher.<br /><br />Around our house we have a laptop running Windows XP, a desktop running Windows Vista Ultimate, a desktop running Windows 7 and an iPhone that is up to date. The iPhone will sort of work without the app and the desktop with Windows 7 works but does not have a wireless connection and the others will not work with Chromecast. I use an Ethernet connection on my computers which has a wireless access point for the wireless devices.<br /><br />Setting up Chromecast for me was not a plug and play experience. I suspect with the app it might have been but the Windows 7 desktop was not connected to the Wi-Fi and the laptop which was wouldn't work because it was using Windows XP. I was faced with the problem of setting it up via a browser in the iPhone sans app and it took some doing on my part.<br /><br />Plugging the Chromecast into the TV was simple; it requires a power source in addition to the HDMI plug-in offers the option of a USB connection to the TV or a transformer connection to a wall plug. Fortunately my TV offered a USB connection next to the available HDMI input so that worked very smoothly.<br /><br />Once the TV had found the Chromecast, which was simply done, the screen showed the Chromecast home screen with the word Chromecast and a number following which identified the device for Wi-Fi connection purposes. I had to set up a temporary Wi-Fi network to complete the settings on the Chromecast.<br /><br />Using the iPhone browser I was able to set up the Chromecast to use the regular Wi-Fi network in the house but had to put in the username and password for it to work. Once this was done I switched the iPhone from the temporary Chromecast network back to the regular household Wi-Fi network and it then found the Chromecast device on my TV.<br /><br />So far I have done some video streaming from You Tube with great success and really look forward to getting the iPhone app when it finally is available. I have no idea how long that will take. There are only very brief summary instructions in the box and it is necessary to go online to get more complete information.<br /><br />One other point is the absolute necessity of a Chrome browser, Chromecast will only work with a Chrome browser as far as I can tell.<br /><br />The bottom line on all of this is the Chromecast seems to be a very useful tool but it's new and may present some setup problems. It took me around three hours to learn, experiment, and finally setup the Chromecast but I'm just a regular guy, no computer expert here. It will probably go a lot faster if you have the appropriate app for your Smartphone or have Windows 7 connected wirelessly to your network.om the temporary Chromecast network back to the regular household Wi-Fi network and it then found the Chromecast device on my TV.<br /><br />So far I have done some video streaming from You Tube with great success and really look forward to getting the iPhone app when it finally is available.

Very different plot and her style of writing is so full of unusual imagery. I am also now reading her previous books. I recommend all of them especially if you enjoy getting into the heads of the characters.

072325804X|5.0|Review written in 2007: I've been reading this aloud to my 7yo for a month or so, reading one story every now and then. The stories are presented here in chronological order as published with 4 unpublished works at the end. The stories are wonderful, darling tales of anthropomorphic animals. Once she married in 1913 she didn't have as much time for her painting and writing and I think it shows as the stories in the first half of the book are much more enjoyable than the latter ones. The stories are somewhat didactic but not overly so. They are also much more violent than I would have remembered them to be. Naughty children are spanked frequently and Potter presents as a matter of fact that animals are often killed by hunters, farmers and other animals.<br /><br />The 7yo really enjoyed the stories, especially the ones in which Peter Rabbit or members of his family appeared. Also, while each story stands alone there are references to prior events and characters and this was fun to notice when reading them in order. This edition itself includes a brief biography of Beatrix Potter at the front and prior to each story is a short introductory paragraph detailing connections in the story with Potter's real life. All the original illustrations, including the original front covers illustrations, are included and this is a book that can be browsed through just for the gorgeous watercolours and sketches.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Sorry, but this series beats twilight ANY day.  It's intelligent, well-woven, and (even though it's aimed at a younger audience) is very enjoyable for someone who likes to think of herself as tween trapped in a 30-something's body.  Enjoyable read.

B006O5YIMQ|5.0|Life can be brutal, and sometimes those perpetrating the most brutality are those that live right under our own roofs Warrior explores explores the oftentimes brutal world of family relationships, and despite thrilling fight scence that will make you both cheer and punch the air in sheer exhileration; the most brutal scenes were the ones where I could just feel the resentment and unforgiveness that can poison a family's love. And if you've ever been close to someone effected by alcoholism, I garantee an enhanced veiwing experience thanks to Nick Nolte, who is simply great in this film.<br /><br />To be clear, the movie never forgets its a movie, it builds and paces and thrills its audience with great fights and an amazing feel for explorations of character motivation. I felt the punches and kicks becuase I knew the emotional center from which they were thrown. And in the end, I was pulling for everybody, but I was mostly pulling for redemption and yes, love. There are criticisms to be made of this film, and I'm sure they are well-founded. However, given the hard won emotional core of this film, picking out little faults seems well,  pedantic. Just watch it, then go to the gym and afterwards maybe a 12 step meeting.

044655667X|4.0|I completely agree with the most recent Hastings review of this book. This is quite a clever and sophisticated novel about the slow slide of an ethically challenged young lawyer who is trying to find his place in the world.  In this novel, the lawyer confronts - and struggles with professional responsibility problems straight out of Legal Professionalism 101 - and frequently chokes when it comes to making the right decision. This is also one of the themes/plots of The Lincoln Lawyer movie with Marisa Tome. Haller's arrogance and sense of entitlement is palpable and well-developed. The reactions by the other characters - like the judge and the Ast D/A - bring home the shadiness of some of Haller's in-court tactics. You don't have to be a lawyer to read this, but you may have to be a lawyer or a law student to understand this book.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I listen to this album most of the time more than any other of my albums I have downloaded in the past. At times when I feel down or stressed, I just sit back and relax hearing the soothing voice of Ms. Alicia Keys, and her music in the songs. I can't say which of them are my favorite since I favor all of them. I had the pleasure to see her for the first time in concert with friends as we traveled great distance to see the amazing performance she put on. I still remember that night as if it was yesterday which is what she does best, creating memories that stay in your mind forever. I recommend this album to anyone who has given up on being a fan of hers, or if they want great smooth R&B and Pop music.

Everything about this performance is perfect and shows the amazing talent Gabriel put together for his albums and this incredible concert.  Thank god Sinaed O'Connor cancelled as Paula Cole is fantastic!<br /><br />However, the transfer to BluRay is terrible and so it the sound.  The original concert was shot on film and you can tell the transfer tried to blur the limitations of the films grain.  The sound seems muffled and has no fidelity to it.  Horrific!  Buy the DVD and skip this one.  If I could return it I would.

B00821OX98|5.0|In 2012 and 2013, TV producers have come up with some awesome shows such as Falling Skies, The Walking Dead, Justified and many others. Thanks God and not a minute too soon. One more reality show, and I may have just climbed the tallest whatever and jump to my demise. I am not going to describe the series and talk about human and Volm’s… But, that the Falling Skies is exciting and entertaining.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a rewarding, addictive series for anyone who watches TV with a social justice or feminist perspective. Great to see strong, interesting, complicated characters played by strong, interesting, complicated, believable people -- the casting is terrific. Loved Nathan Lane, and Julianna Margulies and Christine Baranski are always a treat to watch.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Beyond Oria Falls is the second book in this enchanting series.<br />It continues the story of Oria who, in the first tale discovered the truth behind her people's heritage.<br />Again this is a magical tale which develops the characters met in the previous book as well as introducing Oria's parents who she believed were dead to her.<br />Once more Oria has to draw on the help of her friends, grandparents and magical powers to battle against the formidable strength of the evil spirit, Ala.<br />The description builds a vivid image of nature which works so closely with the spirit world of these native Americans.<br />It is impossible for the reader not to be swept along by the emotion and magic of this tale.
B004GYY714|5.0|I've tried going directly to web sites of radio stations with my phone to listen to their stream, but TuneIn makes it a lot easier.  And all radio stations are grouped together instead of having to go to individual sites.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Hours of fun. And it was free so even if you don't like it you aren't going to lose anything from getting it. The only problems were the amount of in game coins you needed to get to by many of the characters, but that's only a problem if you feel the need to change your character. Even with that it's really fun and the amount of coins you need makes you work harder in the game so makes it more entertaining
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just wish you could turn off the option to send updates to Facebook.  Its a real pain to be hassled by that all the time.  Other than that its a very addictive game.
B00BGTRTSA|5.0|There is so much talent in this band it's hard to be accurate and not sound like your a crazy fan. Sometimes great musicians come together but they don't have a good fit with each other and it sounds terrible. Adrenaline Mob is a perfect band for modern times. Their vocals are understandable and the guy has a wide range, the drummer is obviously well known and a stud that can play any style depending on what band he's jamming with. The real all star in my opinion is the guitar playing. Mister Orlando is a beast who is just as good live as the album. The riffs are original and the songs don't get repetitive. They mix up the pace in this CD and do a great job overall. Easily 5 stars.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|The Long Walk was a good read but something I would not read again. Which is what I often do with the majority of Stephen King's writings.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Next best thing too the walking dead & better than braking bad. I'm just saying everyone like what they like.
B008133MDK|5.0|Picks up right where the cliffhanger of Season 1 ends! Just as good, if not better than Season 1. My favorite episode was #1- The Woman. The second episode had lots of scary/creepy elements while the third episode had a lot of twists and turns. I grew more attached to the main characters as the episodes progressed. Molly, the coroner, is my favorite character because of all of her awkwardness and her huge (transparent) crush on Sherlock. Highly recommended!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Passes the time and not too hard. My 5 year old son enjoys helping me look for the missing objects.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|X-Men: First Class was overall pretty good. Not mind-blowing but a good origins story. Perhaps half of the fun for me was all of the interesting costumes and hairstyles.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All of the fifty shades books were awesome but this one will pull your heart and make you laugh and cry
B009QU9X44|5.0|This novel was splendid on various levels:<br /><br />As the story of two people in love it really succeeds in electing for both Obinze and Ifem, singular personalities -- as good apart as they are together.<br /><br />As a commentary on race (\\"Race is not genotype, it is phenotype.\\") -- it is a conversant one, doing away with all the meaningless tropes that we throw around these days in an effort to remain comfortable; daring to illustrate, in plain terms, that America is a society of the most dangerous kind of tribalism, that is the unseen, subliminal kind; and that it is yet to deal with this subliminal condition, choosing instead to cosmeticise.<br /><br />But most of all this novel was an easy read. And by easy I certainly do not mean \\"simple\\" or \\"unchallenging\\". But it was easy because it was relatable, familiar. As an East African woman to find that which is familiar in literature or television is rare. So rare, in fact, that I was deeply moved by how familiar this novel dared to be to someone like me. Because for someone like me to be able to pick up a book, or begin a television series, and not have to succumb to this process of assimilating into a white world is basically a miracle.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A well written, gripping, creative story that was fascinating and spellbinding. I couldn't put it down. The author raises disturbing questions regarding the balance between genetic and environmental influences.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!! I love joining on the game with my BFF!<br />Soooooo fun! Really recommend this game for adventurous people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun and addicting its amazing and I'm glad I found this game<br /> Thank you who ever created it
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. Only problems are occasional crashes, which can be solved by closing the reopening the app. Great tool for keeping track of project ideas.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Love this movie. I felt very connected to the characters. The support and love of family and friends through some pretty tough situations all with a splash of humor,  makes for a great film. Well done!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I couldn't wait for this movie to come out so I could watch it on my 'Fire' and I was thrilled! The movie mimics various horrors around the world where in minutes the ocean is grabbing and knocking and bouncing and killing everything in it's path. I already forget the country (I'm lucky to remember anything) this family was in (Ewan, Naomi, and two sons). The family was on the beach when this nightmare began. This is a movie I could see again and again for the special effects are so real and so frightening I would have fallen off my bed but then my 'Fire' would have come with me so that wasn't an option. The story envelopes all that happens when this type of tragedy strikes and the mother and one son are together and then they are not and the father is nowhere to be seen. Everyone, as you would expect, was screaming for their children or their family and it touched me so much I cried from beginning to end. This is not a happy go lucky movie and you'll just have to see it to find out the how and the who and the where and the when  but this particular movie is worth the  price of the dvd and/or the charge to rent to your tablet but I warn you - give all the ladies two boxes of Kleenex....no make that three and some of the male persuasion may also get in a sniffle or two. DO NOT MISS IT-FABULOUS, SAD, SCARY, REALISTIC AND TRULY A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|missing a few pieces, but lego easily and promptly replaced and mailed to us.  Instructions were easy to understand.  Fun project
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|It is easy to say I love it because I really like this goofy movie.  The acting is excellent and Albert Finney is wonderful, as is the entire cast.  A real treat.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it's more then finding items, it's like being a detective, it's a story as well. It's very, very, attention catching you don't want to put it away, you really must play it, you won't stop playing it neither.  ITS GRRRREAT
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob<br /><br />by William Landay<br /><br />Every parent's nightmare - your child is accused of a horrible crime. How do you deal with it? How can you put aside your bias and seek the truth? How do you remain supportive and keep your family intact, knowing in your heart - questioning but believing - that your child is innocent? How do you face the harsh realities? How do you cope?<br /><br /> Andy Barber and his wife Laurie must face that reality. At 14, a schoolmate is murdered and their son Jacob is accused of the crime. The courtroom drama unfolds and the reader feels the pain and the anguish of each of the family members. We watch the family fall apart, each one aging, withering, losing touch with reality as the truth and the lies, the coverups and the uncoverings emerge.<br /><br />Andy Barber narrates the story. Abandoned by friends, struggling with his inner self, protecting his wife and his child, his agonies are raw. Family secrets surface adding fuel to an already raging fire.<br /><br />This legal and psychological drama will keep you glued to every page.
B003O86FMW|3.0|More suspenseful than the original, though obviously written with a movie sequel in mind, Katniss and friends (if you can call them that) remain compelling companions.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great TV show! Specially if you like business series. Every episode leaves you in suspense, you always want to see what happens next.
B003O86FMW|4.0|i did not see the ending coming.  totally surprised by the direction it went and looking forward to reading the last one.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|I thought that this was the best of all of the previous OZ movies.  The special effects were very good.  The actors were very good also.  James Franco rocks!  Thank God Disney made a movie without too many munchkins being the main focus of any movie in my opinion.  Very well done movie!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pro's-  Pretty easy to install<br />  -  Lets you mirror just about anything from a Chrome browser window.<br />  -  You can sync any android device or anything that has Chromecast support<br />  (i.e.  Apple products with chrome)<br />  -  Has a support from netflix and youtube.<br />  - the price! there are no solutions like this for the money. flat out.<br /><br />Con's- not fully HD, does up to 720p, but for sake of streaming non Youtube and Netflix windows you have to turn the resolution down to 480p<br />netflix can lag a bit<br /><br /> Here a cool trick/tip to get around using chrome cast from a computer in another room
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a lot of really fun games. some are a bit challenging<br />but its still really really fun. so much fun.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|GOOD game. Wants you to spend money. Kind of childish. Same scenes over and over again with mini game. One more word
B0073PZIBQ|4.0|Good entertainment, especially if you understand the bird watching culture or a spouse that doesn't participate in a relationship!  We enjoyed viewing The Big Year!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good game and I enjoy playing it.  I just got a Kindle and that was the first app I put on it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|just started it and love it John can really tell a story don't know about reading on a kindle it's my first time i like books better
B00AR5AMBU|2.0|very poorly acted, kinda of hoky story line not a good story line. should have rented Anne Hall a far better movie.
B003F44QRQ|4.0|The movie, the music, the dress, and the feel. Took me back tot the 80's. Wife had never seen it before and like it as well. Always love the closing see with the old man.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I was hooked from the first few pages. Cheryl Strayed gives an account of her journey that is honest, wrenching and at times insanely funny. I am recommending this book to everyone.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It seems to clean files quickly and, so far, efficiently. I will update this in a few weeks and report any issues.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|loving it from a lil kid and love to show it to my kids and sit back and take it back to those days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I loved this series. It was so nice to get the DVDs and watch it again. The bluray quality is superb!
B00756GKBA|3.0|Madonna is one of my favorite music entertainers of all time. That lets you know my bias when I say that I was not impressed by MDNA. This album just seemed safe to me. Nothing really stands out. As much as Madonna likes to re-invent herself with each album release, MDNA felt like more of the same. She has bogged herself down in club music for the last two albums now and I feel she needs to try and move on. I loved Confessions on a Dance Floor, but MDNA (and even Hard Candy) did not move my needle.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|I continue to be enchanted by Cecile's jazz vocal talent.  Every song on this album is a refreshing combination of vocal and instruments.
1612183956|2.0|I looked forward to this book, but the writing style made it difficult for me to get very far into it. Every page is filled with one or two word phrases to describe feelings or thoughts. I felt as if I was reading a television or film script in book form. I do not mind short paragraph lengths, but this book had an over abundance of one-sentence paragraphs. &#34;Crouches down beside the bed.&#34; is an example of one paragraph. Where is the subject? I cannot comment on the story or plot as I could not get past the first few chapters.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and  Child never disappoint. Excellent read from page one to the end. Agent Pendergast and his unique assortment of family, friends, and colleagues never fail to intrigue. Especially when Agent Pendergast's personal life is involved.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|After my sister convincing me to read the novel (fool me once) I gave the film (fool me twice) a chance. I hated both of them. I suppose it is to be expected since I am not a tween girl.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|This is a fabulous story of the beginnings of the Wolverine.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  If you have watched the first 3 movies but not this one . . . this will be an excellent addition and will bring a greater understanding to who Wolverine is.
B004NDVJWI|5.0|This is one of the few albums I listen to and do not skip a single song. I am a Prince fan-of-old and Above the Noise captured that sound wonderfully. On this album McFly sounds more Prince-like than Prince does at present! I like that the band has grown as is not afraid to try new directions for their music.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I had read others first; liked Headhunters the best; movie was a bit disappointing compared to book. I'm also a Lee Child Jack Reacher fan; Nesbo is a bit more slow moving than Child. A friend recommended and I read a Clive Custler novel-- didn't like it much- too simplistic, too black and white Hollywood.
1476735115|5.0|I loved this book. The story is fresh and the characters interesting. Howey has created a wonderful world to explore and plenty of mystery and suspense to keep you turning pages. I liked it so much I bought a hardback copy in addition to the paper one just to display in my library. If this is ever turned into a television series, please let FX or HBO do it. NO NETWORK TV! They would only water it down and screw it up (like CBS did with Under the Dome).
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Everybody really should read this book....God Bless America and to the brave soldiers who fight to keep us free!  Amazing story.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Riveting. Am viewing Season 3 now. Even better. Each season is excellent. The characters and plot are well developed and interesting.
B00563M11M|5.0|This book dealt with so many issues about race, prejudice, justice, vengeance in the most humorous, suspenseful but also moving way. I am sure to revisit this one in the future.
0060765488|5.0|This is the original book I am told that they added some extras for the new movie coming out.  This book is a tried and true from CS Lewis.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome app easy to use. My grandchildren love the large button and works great for homework assignments and use at grocery store.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I had this movie and I lent it to someone I went to college with because I really thought she would enjoy it and it would encourage her.  I half way knew I wasn't going to get it back and it was okay.  It wouldn't have changed anything.  The movie is self inclusive and keeps you wondering if they will ever cross the gap to reach each other.  Maybe could have done the end a little better. I still loved it though.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Cool graphics and interesting challenges in addition to a classic game. BUT, you have to pay if you want to play more than a hand or two a day.
B004UID2LC|2.0|It could have been me, but I couldn't get it to work on my Nexus 7.  It was one of the first ones I added.  I left it on there for over a month hoping I would figure it out.<br />I might give it another chance when I have time.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|My teenage niece and I both find this game fun.  We can sit and play for hours.  If you buy this game you will not regret it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I loved the movie but didn't think it deserved 5 stars.  Maybe 4.5.  Though that may change when the others are released and we see where they were trying to go.  I would highly recommend watching this one first then the other LONG but very enjoyable three.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|This is one of the greatest trilogies ever made and it is amazing on Blu-Ray.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not too much to say really....it's a good game if u like puzzles and relieves alot of boredom. Can take a while due to running on energy levels but u wouldn't play it all the time anyway.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is the first book of Ellen's that I've read and I now want to read her previous two books. This was an easy read that was very entertaining.
B00AEBB9O6|5.0|Great story line, best movie that Mel Gibson has done. Nice digital sound and a High Quality Picture, It's worth buying for.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Had to see why this was the  \\"fastest-selling paperback in history.\\" I guess women are just as sexually shallow and horny as men. Poor writing. DH Lawrence did this much better....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever! I'm having so much fun I thought it would be boring or only entertaining for kids but I'm an adult and absolutely love this game!!
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|Excellent Age Reveal Album! ...In How The New Band 'Rise Against' Band Replicated And Is Trying To Slowly Replace The Time Tested Sound Of The Hipster Punk Group 'Offspring'...And How Offspring Are Dealing With Being Slowly Replaced! ...Excellent And Hilarious CD As Always From Offspring! =)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Usually I can guess what the ending will be and love to finish to see if I am right. This book had me guessing until the very end! I've being surprised with the end! Look forward to reading another of his.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not a great read and far too many typing errors. The main characters, Connor and Megan, were likeable and predictable, as was the story. More development and growth of the characters would have greatly improved this one.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It was really a good idea to make this dictionary. I really love this dictionary definition and all the other side of the other hand.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I love books with humorous, unique characters such as those in The Misremembered Man. The heartbreaking vignettes of Jamie's brutal childhood in the orphanage are intertwined just enough to give insight into his character without taking away from the humorous antics throughout the rest of the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So I would play temple run and subway surfers and love it. But this one is my favorite! If u have temple ten and subway surfers and not this...the go out and get it now!
B009G41CG2|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play. Some of them are easier than some of the other games and some take me a lot longer.<br />I keep trying to get them done faster!
B00170F0WU|5.0|OMG what can I say, well I'm usually not a fan of action/thriller movies too much fake stuff these days but OMG this movie is different! Mainly because it was made before the year movies started going down the drain \\"2000\\" but it is a really good movie! They just don't make them like this anymore!! LOVED IT!
B00CEF014E|3.0|It was a confusing  story<br />To much violence in it<br />To many unanswered questions<br />There was no sense to it
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|What I liked about this movie is that it was close to the book but there were some stuff that was left out from the movie. I thought the actors who played the characters played them well and are so close to the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so cool, you can use your imagination to create every thing.<br />There are two game modes:<br />Survival and creative<br />I thing that if you know how to play survival mode  it's fantastic!!!!!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Okay look, this is kinda like the PC Minecraft, because it has like, some of the stuff that the PC Minecraft has. So, I just think, that um..... MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION..... is worse. it keeps freezing on me, and then I have to go ask my Brother to fix it for me...So my brother thinks that Minecraft has a virus on my Kindle Fire, so I deleted it, and now I miss Minecraft Pocket Edition, and I'm such a Minecraft fan...:-(. So, I do recommend this game, but please, Minecraft Pocket Edition it crashes on my Kindle, and it might do it to yours too.
034580404X|5.0|I was very pleased with the story. I couldn't stop reading. I found my self at work wanting to be home reading them. I couldn't go to bed at night until I couldn't read anymore. I will read these again and again.
0307352153|5.0|I think that any introvert would love this book. The author has a great sense of humor. She is familiar with Elaine Aron's work about Highly Sensitive People (HSPs), giving credit where it is do, but goes far beyond that. It is also not just a summary of academic research on the subject of introversion; she has her own story to tell and has done some interesting field work herself. There is nothing dry about this book. I think the book is a sensation because introverts are sick to death of the constant bantering and bullying of extroverts who claim to have all the answers. I personally resent my life being put in jeopardy by extroverts texting or talking on their cell phones while they are driving.<br /><br />There are a lot of introverts in the world and even entire cultures that have valued introversion over extroversion. C.G. Jung wrote that the United States has no use for introverts. It is easy then to see what happened to the first peoples of Turtle Island. If extroverts have any ill-gotten advantages in the United States they are certainly not going to give them up regardless of how well-reasoned Susan Cain's book is. If anything, extroverts will regard the book as a threat to the status quo - a status quo that is leading the human race over a cliff. Martin Luther King, jr. wrote that justice is never voluntarily granted by the oppressor but must be demanded by the oppressed. Extroverts have also done a pretty good job of making introversion a symptom of mental illness in the United States.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great movie. You'll laugh through the whole thing! As good if not better than the first one. Great one-liners and a very entertaining story line.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|I prefer the Mamma Mia soundtrack music sung by Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan,  and the rest of the crew over the orignal soundtrack.
B00B9HEAVS|5.0|Some of the best Euro dance that I've ever heard. Kind of like the best of early Madonna, Cascada, Third Party, Livin' Joy and many other top Euro dance acts rolled into one. Plus, there aren't any of the instruments found in a lot of Romanian House music, like the accordion (yes, really) that don't appeal to US tastes. A great party starter!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is an amazing movie with many funny scenes and has a great moral. Also, it has a beautiful and fantastic ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME AND GREAT JOB MOJANG AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK . PLEASE KEEP UPDATING MINECRAFT PE FOR ME.  PEACE
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and the movie. I can't believe they came out with this game. I LOOOOOVVVVEEEE THIS GAME. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!! :) :D
B009POHHRG|5.0|A classic comic you should read if you have any interests in the Batman theme...<br /><br />Obviously dark as it is part of the dark knight... But an excellent portrayal of the blurred lines of good and crazy evil...
0812982622|4.0|This is an unusual but very readable book. Life in North Korea as described is unimaginable and it makes for an interesting and very engaging story. The effects on people of the all pervasive propaganda and the leadership cult seem realistically described. However one has to remind oneself that the book, because of the nature of the regime and the lack of detailed facts, can only be at best an approximation not a documentary.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Wow, simply a bad movie.  Probably killed the franchise.  This movie should have gone direct to video.  SciFi makes better movies than this turd.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was very good. It had a new spin on the same sort of sci-fi things that are out these days, and I could not put it down. Cassandra Clare makes you want to love every character and brings a whole new fantasy world right to your fingertips. It took me up, up, up and away and out of my own world and into theirs. I loved every minute of it.
B00E8B1358|1.0|While I wasn't a huge fan of.the first I found.d this second one even worse. I had high hopes.that this won would deliver on what g.I.Joe fans were originally hoping for but this fell way short.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really hate not finishing a book so unfortunately I had to finish this one. I read it because it seemed like everyone else who had read it could not put it down. I like my share of raunchy romance novels but this one was slow and not for me. Perhaps it would have gotten better with the second book having all of the introductions out of the way, but being as I barely finished the first, I could not bring myself to spend another $10 and read the 2nd.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I am outside often. like to check before I go. also good coverage of any place family or friends are.
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|I'll start by saying that Merlin was one of my favorite shows.  My family and I would wait each year with great anticipation for the new season to arrive.  Wonderful family entertainment in every way.  I'm not going to give spoilers, but I'll just say this and you can check the reviews of 99% of the fans to back me up: The writers absolutely ruined the ending of the series.  It is so disappointing that many people are inconsolably sick about it.  If you watch Season 5 to its conclusion it will ruin the entire series for you too. Here's a good plan: just watch Season 4 and imagine how you like the story to end.  You will be MUCH, MUCH happier than if you watch it to the end.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Have you ever gone to a movie that was so good you lost track of time until the lights came on? -- same here with all three discs. First out of the package, the 1977 concert -- they were young and fabulous. Then Part One and Part Two discs carefully mix story and music to keep my emotions on edge while I learn how the Eagles evolved. Beautifully packaged in a three-panel fold-out, including an 8-page booklet with seven pictures, and five more pictures on the back of the package. As was stated several times by the Eagles themselves, it is all about the music, and you get a continuous stream of it on all three discs. There is nothing left out of this package for me, except the Eagles Farewell I Tour Live From Melbourne Blu Ray, but I already have that in my library, so I'm set.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|I bought the Weber 7447 and immediately attempted to return it however, due to it having shipped already, amazon offered to refund my money and allowed me to keep the chimney starter.<br /><br />This is by far a WONDERFUL item. If you are into charcoal grilling, then this is a MUST HAVE.<br /><br />Do keep the handle away from any coals you place inside your grill as the handle will melt.<br /><br />Other than that, GO FOR IT!
B00646UU5Y|5.0|I love the concept of this show. Actually very imaginative writing. too bad on prime they don't just throw in the last season after you watch the others. Kind of a bummer to get to the end and then Amazon goes Chaa Ching!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Fun action flick. I had started watching it on the plane and it grabbed me enough to get me to rent it when I got home.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Last time I saw these episodes was on free tv, about 8 or 9 years ago. Tries to be the &#34;new star trek&#34; although it falls short of that, good concepts and stories.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout takes a message that needs to be heard and does it in a current and down to earth way so you Get It!!! Love the experiments. I used the one with hangers as dowsing rods for my 8 and 12 grandchildren and they were amazed! Really good book!!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|This CD is so good! It is something different and enjoyable to listen to. The music is very fun and can be played by anyone who enjoys music.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The quality of the games is amazing because you can fire and reload the guns. The One gun I don't like is the Matisse 98 because it takes a long time to reload the guns .They should change the gun into the Colt 1911. Other gun are ok but my favorite is the  M198 bar . More people should buy this app. It's an amazing app!
B005DJREJS|4.0|I didn't expect it to be entertaining but it was surprisingly humorous. I generally don't like seeing high school (all over again) but the main character shows curious, tenacity, etc. which I applaud. I only watched 2-3 shows but I'll definitely watch again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Didn't want to put this down. Beautifully written with intertwined relationships that felt so real. A thoughtful and insightful take on the phrase &#34;meant to be.&#34;
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a must read for anyone in IT, from support desk to CIO and everyone in between. The authors do such a great job conveying the message of the importance of IT to the business. It also gives those of us in IT an idea of how we can truly make a difference in the business. I can't wait to try out the practices I learned in this book! Bravo!
1250012570|5.0|I am one of the lucky ones who received a copy before distribution in the U.S. It was autographed by the author and she said some very nice things about me. I was truly blessed to have been one of Rainbow's teachers in the sixth grade. She is so gifted in so many ways. I believe critical thinking is probably at the top along with creativity. Her questions always made me think.<br />Her book is fast paced, believable and terrifying. Once you start, you can't put it down.<br />One last thing, she included me, Mr. Sanderhoff, as one of her teachers. Praise indeed. Thanks Rainbow.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|This novel will take you to remote places in this world and twist your thinking as it takes you outside of this world in the relm of quantum physics.  But don't worry, the action and suspense are there along with the twists of fate that James Rollins is known for in his books.  If you have read his prior books this one is a good read.  Not his best as with The Last Oracle but still good.  Enjoy.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I've listened to Enya since her first album came out (Watermark).  Her music is very soothing and relaxing and this compilation picks some of her best work.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a Kennedy assassination junky, combine that with time traveling paradoxes and you get a great story. Great book
B000JWTX3Y|4.0|Couldn't find it anywhere and found it on here for a great price but when it arrived and I handled the package I noticed I heard something sliding around. Opened it to find the disk loose in the case. It didn't have any serious scratches just small ones. I would have been super satisfied if it had arrived without being free in its case.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that I can just pull up the Word of God whenever I need it.  Its a valuable resource for living!
B00AB16ER6|5.0|This has been hyped for awhile now in the rock community. I expected it to be good, but I didnt expect it to be THIS good! Any fan of hard rock/blues rock/Mr. Big will dig this. HUGE harmonies and killer vocals. Billy is bangin' out the bass lines like there's no tomorrow. This is a MUST BUY for any fan of rock!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun game but having to buy add ons is annoying.<br />Its free to begin with why ruin it by doing that.
B000BTJDG2|5.0|There are many &#34;copy cat&#34; movies about Exorcisms but this is not one of them.  This movie is one unique style about the practice  of getting rid of the devil.  It is not scary or gory like the first one but it does have imaginative moments.  I wonder how it would look in Blu-Ray or 3D?
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Loved the way the story is narrated ...has lot of philosophical undertone....some shadow of Godfather & hence, may be I liked it more...
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The first time I watched it, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  And I had to adjust to Nathan Fillion being the anti-villain to Neil Patrick Harris's anti-hero.  However, I learned long ago to give everything a second chance, especially when it wasn't what I thought it would be.  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  This is good on so many levels.  Unfortunately, the lessons to be learned are probably lost on those who need to learn them.  But for pure entertainment:  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  The story is great.  The actors are wonderful.  The music is fantastic.  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!
B00001QEE6|5.0|I bought this movie for a church project. It is a cute movie and a family movie, which at the church they wanted for the children of the clergy to watch during conferences at our local facility.
159463176X|3.0|Well written but the story is not as compelling as The Kite Runner. The characters are not as well-defined and the story rambles a bit.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Our church is working on a project at a local facility for the clergy in our city. One of the request was for Disney DVD's for their children to watch while the clergy were in conference or in a retreat class. This particular movie, being on of the older Disney movies has a lot of cute songs in it and I thought it would entertain them unlike some of the others that are out.
B003UYUP58|4.0|A fascinating look at a disease whose very name was invented by the ancients, but until recently we hardly understood it better than they did. I now understand that the &#34;on-off switch&#34; is in all of us, and days after finishing the book that &#34;switch&#34; went to work on my father. I was glad to have read the book when I did, because it is helping me to understand his treatment and prognosis.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|The story has a few to many &#34;complicated things happened&#34; to explain or transition. I actually prefer the movie version.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I wish the directions were a bit better. It's confusing on what you are supposed to do.... I'm going to keep playing to see if I can figure it out.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I had read 'The Jungle Book' before. it is still an engrossing tale. the original story is more nuanced than the Disney animation.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book.  David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors.  Really tells a good story.  Would recommend this book to any readers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, enjoyed the levels it has and look forward to playing more as they become available. Will keep on my kindle for now.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I am so grateful for this book.  It touched a strange buried part of myself that I wasn't even aware I wasn't aware of.  It is a quick read, graceful and profound.  I love the idea of a language that is structured in such a way that anything that can be spoken in that language is automatically true.  Many pages of this book are spoken in that language, chilling and beautiful.  Thanks, Neil!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|GREAT movie. Perfect mix of humor, action and star quality. We loved it. Saw Red 2 in the theater last week and really hope there might be a Red 3!!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had my own Downton Abbey marathon, thanks to my Amazon Prime. I fell in love with the first season so I had to watch season 2 where my heart was broken when my favorite character died. Season 3's last episode however made me regret watching this show! I can't imagine watching the 4th season without the major character from season 3.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a great episode of The Avengers.  Packed with action filled scenes. Hulk was especially impressive. Can't wait till the next  Advenger  movie
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I liked his other books so much that i had high expectations for this one.  sorry to say i was disappointed.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun little game. I enjoy not being restricted by a timer which frees me up to pause the game when needed.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|i had heard the movie was very violent and was reluctant to see it.  I really liked it, violence and all
B002SQ364Q|5.0|Authentic narrative provides insightful and charming perspectives on how Woodstock '69 came to be and its impact on the Catskills in particular and in human nature generally.

1452126577|5.0|i love reading this book every day :) i do not regret buying this book at all ^.^ it's so adorable and funny. Even the &#34;puzzle&#34; games are funny.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|The results of the test confirmed my personal assessment.  My co-workers have jokingly called me the 'crystal ball' which fits the strategic profile.  I would willing be a career student which fits in with my second strength - learner.  I would rather have taken this test when I was only 29 years old than wait until I am 49.  I highly recommend this book and on-line test.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought this app was gonna be cheesy,but now I cant put it down. Not to mention its free!! How you gonna beat that.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Smash is behind the scenes at the creation of a Broadway Musical.  There have been many different versions of the basic story over the years, but this is the best ever.<br /><br />The script is first rate.  Smart.  Witty.  Integrated.  Funny.  Katherine McPhee as the young actress looking for her break is sheer movie magic.  The Cast is awesome.  There are so many fine performances I don't know where to start.  Debra Messing and Christian Borle as the writers of the new musical seem like they're living their roles, not acting.  The brilliant Jack Davenport as the narcissistic Director Derek Wills seems born to the role. I couldn't imagine anyone else doing it.  Angelica Houston is the Producer.  Megan Hilty is the Broadway veteran determined to get the lead role of Marilyn Monroe.  On and on, each performance builds on and complements the next.<br /><br />I have a daughter who simply cannot watch musical theater.  She flat out hates it.  With that in mind, I'd never recommend Smash to her.  Almost every body else I know can enjoy musical theater when it's done well.  We don't love everything but perhaps we liked The Sound of Music.  Or West Side Story.  Maybe Chorus Line or Dream Girls is more to your liking.  Or Grease, or Les Miserables.  To all of you  I can unequivocally recommend this wonderful season of magical musical drama.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is one of the best sim games I've found, and I've played loads. Having an actual avatar is great, and I LOVELOVELOVE how many gems you get. I love this game, and it'll keep me hooked for... OH NO MY STRAWBERRIES (meta joke hehe)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Not often I spring for 5 stars, but this was most deserving. Great story, great characters and, most importantly (past the first 3rd of the novel) it was difficult to put down. I do worry that younger readers might miss the ingenious clues and numerous references.<br /><br />I remember thinking of one of the obvious (to me) clues from Blade Runner ... and I was right. That in itself is a test - have you ever seen the movie Blade Runner ... if not, then you probably will find many - or most - of the other references meaningless. I built my first computer in 1977 - it was a Sinclair (Science of Cambridge) MK 14 (kit form), and I am still a computer consultant ... I got practically every reference. I know that this story would leave many of my non-tech friends cold. Brilliant as I believe this novel is, it caters to a somewhat small subset i.e. those who have lived through the 80's, 90's and into the new millennium, who were/are computer game players, who know more about computers than \\"here is where you turn it on\\".<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book.
B001JNNE64|5.0|famous film of Milos Forman in very nice adjustment. Nice graphic and very good text. Record is technically perfect, both picture and sound. Recomended!
B005COO1X6|2.0|The characters were, as usual, great. King has a talent for sketching believable people, and he normally has a talent for storytelling. This particular story seems more like a chunk out of the middle of a longer work.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|It's a great show. I am playing catchup since 'cutting the cable' so am watching via Amazon Prime.  Am looking forward to the directions that it will take.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was a so lost in this created word that I read this all night long.  Gaiman creates characters you really know and care for.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Every book I have read by Jodi Picoult has been well-researched and well-written.  I'm amazed at the different venues this author writes about, from WW II Germany to subjects that are part of our world today.  She must have an amazing research staff.  But, it takes the real talent to put it all together to make a story that is both interesting and suspenseful.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Drove me crazy until I completed it in full. Enjoyed playing it very much but don't want to go at it again. I don't have the energy.
B000IKQMFO|3.0|Purchased this item because it was mentioned as &#34;from the creator of Downton Abbey&#34;.  It's an interesting suspenseful story, but there are so many characters that for the short duration of the film I found it difficult to keep them identified.  In my opinion Downton Abbey is certainly the better creation.
1781162646|5.0|My daughter was pleased with book. She is an avid Stephen King fan and loves all his work a lot.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is well worth your money and even better you won't need money because it is free. This game is great but it does get old.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME :)!!! the minions are the cutest part in it! I love there little costumes and everything!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Such a wonderful game so many strategies to use a must have game for any time or part of the day
B007N85POS|4.0|Although I have really enjoyed playing Angry Birds Rio, some of the levels are almost too difficult to get through.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved the book It was very good I think it was the best one yet the it was kind of funny
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|I love these classic movies so I was super excited to get this in the mail and pop it in the DVD player immidiatly and watch it
0316123587|5.0|All gleeks will love this book! You will laugh reading all the quotes and looking through the pictures. Get it!
0446580848|4.0|I started reading this one just before the recent evacuations from Yemen. The Coreys go to Yemen, but about 10 years prior to these recent events. You could almost fast forward the book to present time. It is a great book, a fast read, and terribly satisfying at the end. Nelson DeMille at his finest.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Crisp, true to Jane Austen's writing.  Feels like you've stepped right into the novel.  The restored edition makes this an excellent addition to anyone's romantic video collection.
B00COCY67A|5.0|John Lennon said Elvis died when he went into the US Army and to some extent over the years I've thought the same. However this changed when I bought the modestly priced triple CD collection of his Stax recording sessions. Maybe John was wrong. You can only be a teenager for so long....I had matured a bit and with time my tastes in music has changed a little and it is reflected in my enjoyment of most things Elvis put out, even after the army days.<br /><br />This is a great triple album and much better value than buying just the single set which was originally my intention. The triple set has a rather over-big packaging with a good 44 page colour book that has photographs of Elvis in karate pose, in his car, the recording documents and other interesting paperwork.  Also liner notes about each of the songs presented. The out takes album (which is also the single set) has some value in how the Pelvis chatted or prepared for some tracks, warm ups for want of a better description.  I found the whole album the best value Elvis product that I can remember for a while.  There is no dragging the bottom of the barrel here, it is all good.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Easily one of the better documentaries I've seen in the past few years. Dave Grohl does a remarkable job of story telling, and bringing in the human element of rock music. I feel like I better understand what drives musicians to make music. Certainly to see the creative process between so many of the great musicians in the later part of the film is truly awesome to behold. I completely and wholeheartedly recommend this film!
0812550706|5.0|This was so thought provoking and down right entertaining.  The seller was amazingly prompt but it would have been worth waiting for it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|If there is  anything in the entire world put in the press about Denzel Washington it has to be good press. He is by far and away one of the best actors in Hollywood today.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The characters are well developed<br />The plot is interesting<br />The story moves and doesn't lag<br />For those that like adventure this is right down your alley
B004X75RK4|5.0|We loved this movie!  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds were both great in their respective roles.  Betty White was funny!  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have had a lot of fun playing this and the minions are super cute. free is also a great price.
B00BEXB18M|2.0|This album isn´t good. I miss Countdown to extinction, Youthanasia, Hidden Treasures phase. Megadeth was on top. Top songwriting and melody. Miss Marty Friedman and Nick Menza. Just sad the way Megadeth music is lost nowadays.  Even Risk is better for me. If you are in doubt, don't buy it, it is lost of money. Better luck and inspiration in the next album. I know that Marty Friedman will not return. But Menza is open to a return. Bring him and a Max Norman follower as the producer. Who else makes songs like Train of consequences, Family Tree, Angry Again? This is the Megadeth sound. Please Megadeth, hear your fans! You can be back on top.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I saw this film opening weekend and I left the theatre thinking \\"WOW!\\". And while normally that would mean awesome it this time meant they screwed up some things. Now before I begin reviewing the film I must state and caution readers I HAVE NOT read the book nor will I (not into novels). Having said that I do love zombies and I do enjoy some of Pitt's vehicles this being one. Now the first thing I find very annoying is the rating. Yes it had around a $200M budget but to me that is not to say it wouldn't have done well at the box office had it been rated R. When a zombie bites someone blood SHOULD be shown and when you see a reanimated corpse running well it should be a bit more scary. The thrills that led this film should have been replaced with suspense. Pitt did an alright job but for a guy who pretty much got this project off the ground well I would have thought his performance would have been more emotional now this isn't to say he was by any means bad but he was a bit disappointing for me. As for the overall tone of the film it was mixed as I previously noted thrills should have been suspense and there should have been some gore (by no means am I saying it should have been an NC-17 movie) and a lot more scares.<br /><br />Now you know where I stand I would like to point out that I am still excited to see this film by seeing the Unrated version in hopes that some of the things that disappointed me will be fixed and I can bump up the rating of this movie at least a half star. In closing if you ONLY want a shoot em', thrill ride zombie flick with pretty good storytelling this film is for you. However if you love Zombies and want a true adaptation (again I haven't read the book but many have expressed that it isn't loyal to the novel) that is gory and scary well this probably isn't for you....yet! There is still hope as I have mentioned...with an unrated cut we hardcore zombie fans might be able to say this is fun and scary not just fun. Until then I will just watch Dawn Of The Dead. Though I hope to add this to my collection very soon. Lastly it is also worth noting this film made some profit (500M+ Worldwide at the box office) so with a sequel or sequels we could very well get a better zombie flick out of Pitt and crew.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I usually like my book a little more physical, but I loved this one nonetheless.  Believable characters you'll root for.  Can't wait to read another by Mrs. Kelly.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|I have read many of jo nesbo and the Harry Hole series and I found this a bit disappointing. The story jumped around a lot and the language didn't flow. It was obvious it was a very early work.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book but I was really angered by some of the information I garnered from it--the fact that Nixon,in the leadup to the election of 1968, interfered in the attempts to establish peace talks with the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong was despicable - he and Kissinger wanted the peace talks to be part of the Nixon presidency and not President Johnsons'--this caused the possible ceasefire to be delayed past the October date that President Johnson was aiming for--this information is personally offensive to me since my brother was killed in Vietnam in November.1968 and a ceasefire would have probably kept this from happening
B004SVM7BW|5.0|It's a pretty basic pdf app. Nothing fancy, just good. It opens pdf's from email and converts word documents. Again, it does what you need it to.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|This band has pop sensibilities that are reminiscent of many great recordings, but Tame Impala still manages to sound unique. Several songs have infectious melodies that linger in my head for days, and then rekindle when i least expect it. The disc still remains in my rotation of CDs for commuting and for home. The band is on tour in the US during the summer of 2013. i hope to catch them in St. Louis when they get to be headliners.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The instructions are a bit confusing at some of the rooms, but the graphics  are colorful. Would have to think about purchasing this game.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Beautiful restoration of 3 classic movies enjoyed them before really enjoy them now couldn't ask for a better purchase at a fantastic price.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The epic and brutal honestly of this book brought me to tears. It made me feel insignificant and unworthy of this life given to me, though it was in the best way. That doesn't make sense to anyone who has not read it, but complete and utter sense to those who have. Bravo, Mr. Green, bravo.
140006922X|5.0|I thought the author did a great job telling the reader what were opinions, facts, and theory as well as what part of Christianity  was based on pure nonsense.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thus game is very addictive. The sound effects add to the fun and anticipation if playing with the minions.. Try it!
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are just as intriguing the second time around. It's nice to be transported to another life. If only...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I totally love this game! I have already got a few of my friends addicted to it. I wish it was a little bit cheaper to get some stuff but I guess its for the hard core non stop takers. but I love it!
020161622X|5.0|The book doesn't go deep on details, but gives a great overall programming mindset. Basically, it shows you how a good programmer should behave on different aspects of our profession.<br /><br />Controversial questions like:<br />- Should I always focus on the best quality?<br />- Should I use my favorite language for everything, even when there are better options?<br />- Can I solve a problem I don't fully understand?<br />- Which technologies every programmer should know? And which tools should I have in my toolbox?<br /><br />Furthermore, the book is:<br />- language agnostic. Thus, it is useful for C, Java, C++, Ruby and any kind of programmer;<br />- short, with a bit more than 300 pages. What makes the book feasible to read many times;<br /><br />This book is a great complement to the Code Complete, 2nd edition.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|The New York Times book review featured this book a few weeks ago and I hesitated from purchasing it for my Kindle, because I do not enjoy reading on the Kindle. I made an agreement with myself to limit the kindle purchases to low cost or free books, but I made an exception for \\" We are all completely beside ourselves.\\"<br />This book is unlike anything I've read in a long time. The author challenges the reader intellectually and emotionally. i had to stop myself from reading this book twice because I wanted to be in a private place to read the painful passages. There are not that many but they are emotionally satisfying. I recommend this book and I can't wait for my sister to read it so that we can discuss it.
B0054SMID0|4.0|A great suspense film.  I'm more of a Marisa fan, but Matt is great in this film.  Reminds me a bit of Mississippi Burning w/ Sandra Bullock, but in a more recent and urban setting.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I had no use for this so I uninstalled it. I didn't find it user friendly or even how to maneuver in it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a good game, one that particularly appeals to kids who enjoy the interactive environment and play options, Should keep a certain young one happy for a while

B008XG1X18|4.0|very good app to have to access the pinterest account. so many people using it now with lots of ideas
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I really like this product specifically its ability to charge at 2.4 amps. This port actually charges an IPad at a good rate. As the minimum requirement for an IPad is 2.1 amps.  After buying several other products that have failed after only a few uses. I decided to spring for the a product that appeared to be better guality ( So hard to tell from the pictures) and have the better technical specifications. Wasn't I pleasently surprised when it came and it did have that higher quality. I bought this particular car charger so we could use and charge our Iphonehs and Ipads in the car at the same time.  We travel quite often ( every weekend to our lakehouse). This means 6 Iphones and 2 Ipads all going at once.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I didn't download it because I already downloaded the original FB. not sure what this is and what it does
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I thought the movie was good.  My son loved it.  I was disappointed in the beginning - I won't say why for those that have not watched it yet.  It was a GI Joe movie.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|was not impressed with the game. I didn't like it so well. maybe for younger crowd, not my thing to use
B000W74EQC|5.0|If you read the books it was even better- but even if not, what a wonderful introduction to this magical series...
0385349947|5.0|Good book, informative- makes you think about how to Lean In a little more than you might already be doing.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I could watch this over and over again and just imagine that it was real and happened to a woman who was dumped but her boyfriend and lucked out by finding a &#34;real man&#34;...
B0032UYFA6|3.0|I'd like to award this three and a half stars, signifying something in between \\"I'ts OK\\" and \\"I like it.\\"  I am one of many who loved the First Season, was disappointed in the Second one but who has continued to watch it.  It IS addictive!<br /><br />I don't think Season Three matches the quality of Season One but it's no worse than the second one. I found the initial premise of the mild-mannered Walter Mitty type science teacher, hen-pecked by his wife, cheated out of his fair share of his research by Eliot, the hyper-successful entrepreneur, finally coming into his own power to be a wonderful idea.  It's sort of a modern day Odyssey in my opinion.  And it worked really well as a black comedy, especially in the opening shows which were often hilarious.<br /><br />By Season Two Walt is feeling his oats and he's a little less interesting and less likable.  By Season Three I find him to be often annoying, as in \\"The Fly.\\"  Egad!  We are given some relief when he shows his heroism in positive ways, like by saving Jesse.  And then we are shown the \\"cute\\" moments when he cuddles his baby girl.  I've read that the intention of the writer was to show Walt's shift from a good guy to a bad guy.  And this is what has happened.  I would prefer a more heroic journey...from a powerless wimp to a stong hero who uses his power for good.  But they didn't ask my opinion and I guess that was already done in Superman.<br /><br />Anyway I am addicted and I have continued to watch it in spite of my objections.  There are some nice moments.  I like the lawyer (I live in New Mexico and there ia some business that hires a guy to dress up as the Statue of Libery and wave to people in the street....I'm suprised Saul hasn't done that yet.  Anyway I have to laugh every time I see the statue on his roof.  I also like that little lock of hair that comes down on his forhead...very cute.  It's details like this that are delightful, especially for us locals who know the scene....like Blake's Lottaburgers and the Georgia O'Keefe vagina paintings.  I like Chicken Man, too---he's an original and a break from the usualM Mexican drug thug types. I also loved \\"Gale\\" the Libertarian chemist with the very good taste in home furnishings!  Ha!  The scene of him singing along to some  obscure Spanish language song was priceless.  I also appreciated the appearance of Jesse's old pals at the 12 seep progrma, especially outside when one said he was alrady on the sixth step!<br /><br />Some of the story lines that were started in earlier seasons were dropped and I wonder if they'll be picked up later---Marie's shoplifting habit and Skyler's helping Ted's cooking the books.  I'd like to see these picked up later...especially all they both involve law breaking.  Marie is also much more interesting in her ditzy mode than in her serious wife mode.<br /><br />The most interesting feature of the series to me is the relationship of Jesse and Walt.  We can see that Jesse needs a good dad and I had to wonder at first why Walt seemed to take such a fatherly interest in Jesse, given that he has a son.  Then I realized that Walt Jr. (aka Flyn) looks up to his DEA Uncle Hank as a role model....which leaves Walt needing a son. I know that's kind of a stretch but it does provide some credibility for his feelings towards Jesse.<br /><br />The ratio between gang related violence and human interactions is still too much loaded for violence for my taste.  And I would like to have more reason for rooting for Walt, since he has become such a prick at times.  It's funny that I don't mind his violent acts as much as I cringe at the way he harps at poor Jesse.<br /><br />I add that I saw this in one fell swoop on Netflix.  I don't know if that affects my opinion of the show or not.  I do know that myy eyes are tired.  But after a break I'll move on to Season Four, hoping for the best.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|Playback lagged a bit, but this movie is a pure classic. Everyone should see it, if only for the pop culture references you hear from it.
0525952926|5.0|Follett is at his usual best. Marvelous storyteller who always manages to weave intricate patterns of life to hold you mesmerized.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I love the Bourne movies, but I didn't expect much from this one without Matt Damon. Unfortunately, I spent a lot of the beginning of the movie wondering how this one fit in with the others. Once I stopped doing that and just watched the movie, I enjoyed it.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|It pretty much does what it is suppose to do. Like that you can change the background. It is convenient and efficient.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A very good weather tool.  Regional coverage is usually exact for the most of the time.  Options to check other cities and areas work nicely.  Find it and load this app on to your device.  Don't like , , , delete.  But first check with a full battery charge.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I always loved this movie. It is full of paradies (that you wouldn't understand unless you are familiar with the likes of Mrs. Maples. Charlie Chan, Sam Spade). It's good clean fun.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun you get to compete in competitions and buy new and fun horses. You can take pictures, change horses change tack and buy boots for your horse.
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|Neil Jordan's latest is a low key voyage into the human side of being a vampire. Mother and daughter team Clara and Eleanor are approaching their 200 year adolescent crisis. Forever 16, moody, creative Eleanor is the polar opposite of her flamboyant mother. The film focuses more on Eleanor who, raised in an orphanage that instilled moral authority is a kinder, gentler vampire. She is tired of being alone, lying to everyone she meets and is ripe for romance. She feeds only on the elderly whose lives have lost meaning and are ready to die. Her mother, sold into prostitution at an early age has a much different attitude toward the world and survival.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the idea of a feminist plot. While the male vampires are quite upset when Clara \\"steals\\" her way into the boys club, that element of the plot is not nearly as fleshed out as the themes of loneliness, aimlessness and the quest for survival. What I liked most about the film was that I witnessed decent acting and character development rather than special effects. Unless you consider a fingernail growing and water turning red to be the epitome of CGI, there are no special effects or horrid transitions using make-up and blood is kept to a minimum. It is set to music which includes nice renditions of Beethoven's Sonata in C Major Op. 2 No. 3, Adagio, and Schubert's Landler D790 No. 4 and Nacht Und Traume, D.827, as well as Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues Op. 87 No. 2 in A Minor. To top off the soundtrack an eerily beautiful version of the Coventry Carol is included.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this.I would recommend  this game to anyone it's so addictive. And easy to learn to play. It's fun and somewhat like the Sims game that I also enjoy
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I found this book to be helpful and reassuring, without a hundred pages of padding and extra stories to make it seem like a longer book. She offers you examples to prove to yourself that the principles work and funny, is it coincidence or do things happen according to your requests? The first thing I asked for (within 48 hours) was a free dinner, and I went to a local fair, saw a friend and was handed a handful of his extra food tickets which he did not want me to pay for. So I had a free meal. The book was definitely worth the couple of dollars I paid for it and I appreciated the author not wasting my time with padding. I think it would be fun and instructive to do these exercises with a friend and compare results.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Well, there were some lively moments of magic...but felt all the hype was way off mark. Nor memorable, have not thought of this book since I finished it!
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|Although i did miss the comedy that the original had, i found this to be as equally intense and demented as the original.<br />A fantastic effort on what was going to be a tough film to remake, having got over the disapointment of there being no laughs, watching it a second time around you really notice the claustrophobia and isolation.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|....it's lost it's charm. Why? No more daily rewards, and the CONSTANT pop up on the screen trying to get you to buy the \\"TNT Drop\\" has become way beyond annoying. This version is supoosed to be ad free.<br />Was a five star game until this nonsense started.
B002NNA9N0|4.0|Great acting based on a play so don't expect much in the way of special effects. Great cameo by Alec Baldwin.

B00908DDZM|5.0|Pushing 30 and buying a musical album is rare in my days. Most of the individual tracks released onto the air got me interested in Macklemore. The fact that he was a local artist made me wanted to buy his album to support what I've heard so for. After listening to each track, I'm blown away by the lyrics and especially the beats. My taste in music is extremely diverse and this album is one for all groups.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like the game and it doesn't take long to get city points I can leave the game and coke back to 300,000 points
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The first three-quarters of Oblivion wasn't so bad.  I found it intriguing enough to hold my attention and keep me interested.  By the end of my first viewing, however, I was completely stumped.  What was I not understanding?  So...I watched it again.  I even enjoyed it more the second time than the first but wham! Got to the end and was again completely baffled.  I guess I'll have to consult someone much smarter than I (not hard) to help me understand what in the world is going on because Oblivion isn't providing any obvious clues.  Why the unnecessary complications?  The rest of the movie was enjoyable to watch but was also fairly standard sci-fi stuff when it comes right down to it.  I doubt that I ever want to watch it again simply because of it's confusing nature.  I have to ask: Why mess with the audience that way?  Why not write a script that clearly explains what's going on?  Too much is simply left dangling which ultimately destroys the entire movie except for the fact that the graphics and other aspects of the movie are quite stunning and interesting.<br /><br />I was somewhat loathe to give Oblivion 3 stars; it really deserves a weak 2.5 stars.  Oh yes, just as a side note, one other aspect of this movie that I just couldn't understand:  Victoria/Vika's eyes were so dilated throughout most of the movie that it was as if she was on LSD or something.  Actually, when she first appears, I thought she was meant to be some kind of android or something.  Her behavior was also very unhumanlike; more robotic than human.  And the very obvious fake eyelashes of hers in the year 2077?  I mean, here they can clone humans and develop all these high tech gadgets and weapons, but can't come up with a more realistic looking fake eyelash?  And again, what's with those eyes of hers?  In addition, anyone who's ever had their pupils dilated that much knows how sensitive to light your eyes become, often forcing the person to wear sunglasses.  Again, there is never any reason or explanation made apparent for this.<br /><br />In the end, there are just way too many plot holes and logical inconsistencies to truly \\"sell\\" this movie to me.  I was on board for the better part of the movie until the end.  Sorry, the director, writers and producers failed to close the deal with me on this one and yet made a film with some saving graces as well.  I just wish I knew what the hell was actually supposed to be going on.r explanation made apparent for this.<br /><br />In the end, there are just way too many plot holes and logical inconsistencies to truly \\"sell\\" this movie to me.

B004RCUJ9E|3.0|The free paid app of the day for Saturday August 17, 2013 is Checkers from AI Factory Limited.  Amazon had this as a free app of the day previously back in October of 2011, but I wasn't able to purchase this app at that time, so this is a new game app to me.<br /><br />This is Checkers which mostly everyone knows so I won't bother explaining the rules.  This version seems to follow the most common rules of the game.  The graphics are OK but not spectacular.<br /><br />My main problem with this game is that playing the AI in this game at the higher levels is like playing Tic Tac Toe.  Most people know that most games of Tic Tac Toe usually end in a tie or a draw.  Playing against the AI at the higher levels feels similar to those kind of predictable Tic Tac Toe game outcomes.  Once the AI opponent manages to get one of their pieces to the other side to be promoted, the game is really over since the AI has a huge advantage at that point which is practically impossible for a human player to overcome since the AI makes little or no mistakes.<br /><br />I also felt the History section of the instructions to be too short.  Why do they have 3 sentences to tell about a history of a game that has been around for over 3 millenniums?<br /><br />As the game is just a typical port of Checkers to Android and contains nothing special plus with the hard to beat AI that usually ends in a predictable outcome each time like I mentioned above, I am choosing to give this 3 stars out of 5 stars.<br /><br />In my opinion what this kind of game really needs to separate it from the many other Android versions of this game is to get a famous player to endorse this and to include helpful game tips from the endorsed player to help you improve your game.
B005D4YHP2|5.0|This is my first pair of Keen. I absolutely love how they fit! They are comfortable, and very versatile. They are a great value for the dollar!
0143124544|5.0|What a wonderful story. A love story for sure but so much more.  The developing relationship between patient and caregiver evolved so gracefully, filled with my laughing out loud and something a book hardly ever does to me...shedding tears. Moyes has written a book that certainly drew me in emotionally.<br />Life isn't fair, and you can't change some things or circumstances no matter what you do, but along the way you can improve life in the moment and in the end not only did you do your best you grew yourself. That's what these two did for each other.<br />I am looking forward to reading Jojo Moyes other books. This one was a great beginning.

B004ADH1RI|4.0|One of my favorite movies from my childhood. Watched it with my own kids recently and wish it didn't have so much cussing. It's not a lot. Mainly the s word, which would not be PG in today's rating standard.<br />Still love it though...

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought this to give to a friend as I knew she would love it too.  To my way of thinking, Richard Armitage out-Darcy'd Colin Firth's Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice and North and South was my first introduction to this incredible actor over 8 years ago.  I have found over the years that many, many other people share my view.  It made me want to read the book which I have done several times and I always keep at least 2 copies of the DVD at hand as I never want to be without one.  I have actually lost count of the times I have watched it and never tire of it as it is such a wonderful story.  You just have to watch the ending to understand why!! :)

B0090KZDSK|1.0|Take the main characters for books one and two, then take the sex and the drama, put all in a bag and shake, and pour out to form a new book. Sure, there are things happening in this book, but are they really developing the story? The characters? Do you get a feeling that this story was a meaningful addition, that you were pulled into it, that it needed to be told? No, no, no, no and no. This books only purpose is to make more money for the author. Save your dollars to some other book that actually has a good and novel story to be told.

B00BEIYH6U|4.0|Initially, the premise of the Kick-Ass universe seemed like such an arbitrary idea.  After all, who would read a comic book about a bunch of kids trying to emulate comic book characters?  These kids are the equivalent of Peter Parker, only without the super powers, but not unlike Batman - minus the ambition and wealth.  They live in the real world in an unforgiving setting where it would be completely impossible for any of these characters to keep their identities a secret, not to mention live long enough to fight actual crime for more than a day.  In any event, the comic book mini-series was quickly adapted to film in 2010, and Kick-Ass went on to gross nearly $100, prompting creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. to begin work on a comic book sequel, Kick-Ass 2 - which was also quickly adapted to film.<br /><br />Directed by Jeff Wadlow (Cry Wolf, Never Back Down), Kick-Ass 2 once again stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson as David Lizewski aka Kick-Ass and Chloë Grace Moretz as Mindy Macready aka Hit-Girl.  After the death of her father, Hit-Girl is having trouble adapting to a normal life of high school and studying.  But, she makes a promise to her guardian, Marcus (Morris Chestnut) to give up being Hit-Girl.  At the same time, David is bored after having a taste of being a superhero and decides to hit the streets once again by joining a group of superheroes, called \\"Justice Forever.\\"  Still coping with the death of his father, Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has revenge on the mind and hatches a plan to eliminate Kick-Ass as payback for murdering his father.  Now working under a new, profane identity, D'Amico hires a group of villains to counter Justice Forever.  It's an all-out war between heroes and villains, and absolutely no one is safe.  Jim Carrey, Clark Duke, John Leguizamo, and Lindy Booth also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />While the first Kick-Ass film was a bit slow-going at first, it eventually picked-up the pace about half-way through the film, which definitely helped set the tone for the sequel.  With the characters fully established, the sequel had plenty of opportunity and potential - and it most certainly didn't disappoint.  Naturally, in order to enjoy a story like this, you'll quickly need to come to grips with the idea that it's completely silly, non-realistic, and basically a joke.  However, the characters in this sequel do everything in their power to send a message that this film stands on its own merits, outside a world where superheroes can fly, bend metal, or shoot laser beams out of their eyes - and so on and so forth.  At no point during this sequel does it feel dull, boring, or un-entertaining.  The action is relatively constant, and even though the jokes are silly and costumes look like something you'd buy at Wal-Mart, it doesn't delude the quality of the film - unless you simply didn't enjoy the first endeavor.<br /><br />By far and away, the most enjoyable character of the Kick-Ass franchise is Hit-Girl.  Despite her young age, she steals every scene with her charisma - and Batgirl-like costume, complete with wig and purple motorcycle.  Following her lead is Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who does surprising well as a villain, although he comes off as a bit too tyrannical at times.  If this were a real-life superhero situation, he'd probably have someone twice his size slap him and put him in the corner.  Regardless, his attitude is on par with the character, but his name is probably over-the-line, along with his bondage-based black leather costume.  Finally, it should be noted that Jim Carrey portrays a likeable character, called Colonel Stars and Stripes - with a background as a former mob enforcer.  Despite his disdain for the film's violence, Carrey is actually one of the most violent characters, essentially taking over the role as the elder mentor for Nicholas Cage.<br /><br />Obviously, the elephant in the room is in regards to this film is focused solely on Jim Carrey and his comments about Kick-Ass being far too violent.  Is Kick-Ass 2 a violent film?  The simple answer is yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean Jim Carrey was right to criticize this film.  If you're a parent and you watch this flick, there will be a number of things that bother you about it - namely the violence inflicted to and by characters that are portraying high school students - not to mention you will most likely also be bothered by the language being used by a sixteen year old girl.  However, if these issues are such a hang-up, the simple solution is to not watch it.  Kick-Ass is not the only movie on the market with an abundance of violence and abusive language.  American culture is based on the idea of individual choice, and people that are uncomfortable with Kick-Ass should exercise their right not to watch.<br /><br />Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is superior to its predecessor in nearly every way possible.  There's more action, a more elaborate story, and the characters are given an allotted amount of space to expand their individual stories without focusing too much on one specific storyline.  Even though this film feeds off the success of past comic book film - one example includes a rough reenactment of The Dark Knight Rises' final battle between heroes and villains, the film still manages to create constant entertainment and endless fan boy pleasure.  And, if you can manage to look past the senseless violence, sexuality, and abusive language, you'll find a story that tells an interesting, action-packed tale about kids wanting to be superheroes.<br /><br />P.S. - Don't forget to stick around for the post-credits scene. Bring on the trilogy's finale.<br /><br />GRADE:  B<br />FNDNreview.comments about Kick-Ass being far too violent.  Is Kick-Ass 2 a violent film?  The simple answer is yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean Jim Carrey was right to criticize this film.  If you're a parent and you watch this flick, there will be a number of things that bother you about it - namely the violence inflicted to and by characters that are portraying high school students - not to mention you will most likely also be bothered by the language being used by a sixteen year old girl.  However, if these issues are such a hang-up, the simple solution is to not watch it.  Kick-Ass is not the only movie on the market with an abundance of violence and abusive language.  American culture is based on the idea of individual choice, and people that are uncomfortable with Kick-Ass should exercise their right not to watch.<br /><br />Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is superior to its predecessor in nearly every way possible.  There's more action, a more elaborate story, and the characters are given an allotted amount of space to expand their individual stories without focusing too much on one specific storyline.  Even though this film feeds off the success of past comic book film - one example includes a rough reenactment of The Dark Knight Rises' final battle between heroes and villains, the film still manages to create constant entertainment and endless fan boy pleasure.  And, if you can manage to look past the senseless violence, sexuality, and abusive language, you'll find a story that tells an interesting, action-packed tale about kids wanting to be superheroes.<br /><br />P.S. - Don't forget to stick around for the post-credits scene. Bring on the trilogy's finale.<br /><br />GRADE:  B<br />FNDNreview.com

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert is one of the most talented vocalists that I have heard in my lifetime. He is so energetic and fun; a real joy to listen to. But he can also reach into the very depths of your heart and make you weep. I am just anxious to see where his path is going to lead.

B0091REZMW|5.0|I have this on all devices.  One of my first downloads.  Just wish I could carry an account.  Other tan that I no complaints.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I bought this for my father for his birthday as he loves history, we both watched the movie - it's an absolutely riveting, solid performance by the whole cast. Million thumbs up from us :-) Daniel Day Lewis portrayal of Lincoln is outstanding!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Full Facebook works great for me. I can easily use all of its features. Everything looks just like it does on my laptop.
0062278096|5.0|This was a birthday gift for an eight year old obsessed with all things Sherlock and of course all of the adults are enjoying it too!
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Howevr, getting coins on every app is getting old......someone eventually has to<br />come up with something new.. soon I hope
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|makes me want to read the book.  Extended cut worth watching.  would definitely like to see more Rorschach.  Get it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is my first time watching anything Dr. Who. My friends kept telling me that I needed to watch it. When we got Amazon Prime and had access to all past seasons, I started watching from the beginning. I LOVE it so far! It keeps getting more and more creative!
0788859544|5.0|My granddaughter and nephew were both wanting this movie so I know two people will be very happy come Christmas.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I bought the album because of Radioactive and was hoping to find some other songs I might like as well, unfortunately that didn't turn out to be the case for me, the other 10 songs just aren't on the same level.  Your mileage may vary.  Still a fan, just hoping for more work as catchy and addictive to listen to as Radioactive.
B009DH2PP4|3.0|I have to rate this item to remove it from my list. So here is the rating just because it has to be done.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|So many of these songs are old favorites.  I love Genesis and Phil Collins.  Great selection of songs on this album.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Works as needed to sharpen knives quickly and safely. Small and compact but works. I would recommend this item to others
086571701X|5.0|This is a very informative book on Aquaponics.  Something I knew very little about.  It is becoming a popular way to grow food.  This is very in depth book.  Great illustrations and technical information, giving many options for how to have an Aquaponic garden.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|The writers put all the cookies into the special effects box. So many things did not add up, we have a giant crab or whatever it is, supposedly capable of running an elaborate, sophisticate alien ship. The thing could fragment itself and escape or attack, sometimes it would have a clever survival mode but most times it was unable to stave off its uncontrollable urge to attack and give itself away. No way to capture and eradicate it, earth is doomed.
0767836286|5.0|This is a very good movie on how 'any' very well organized group terrorist or otherwise could manipulate someone who is 'ignorant' of these kinds of people, willing to kill, harm or sacrifice themselves for a 'cause'?  False flags, to manipulate others to think or accept what you want them too.  Great movie, both Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins play convincing roles.  If you like suspense and 'government' spy type movies... you will enjoy this.<br /><br />It is horrific ...but this is not fiction, because this happens around the world I would bet.  Disturbing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love this trilogy. So i was hoping the best. And now im very happy with the product, because its perfect. the best quality in each disc.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Wrote this review so the game would stop asking me to rate it. It's just as good as the ps3 version.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a lot of fun, i totally get sucked into it. it crashes sometimes but the last update really helped
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Great graphics and interesting puzzles. Although, the instructions for some of the puzzles could have been more precise.<br />I would recommend this game for sure!
0763635383|5.0|The book and CD was  a good size for little hands and  I liked that they could read along with the CD. They also loved the stickers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely loved it I think its a lot of fun and so many people will love it to ... $$&quot;%:;;****** =)
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The story is unlike anything I've ever read. I'm recommending it for my book club because it will provide a great discussion.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|A very beautiful movie filled with deep love and compassion, as well as suspense.  The music was so exquisite and passionate.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|A good but not great link in the chain of books.  We are granted some perspective and additional back stories here. The payoff should come in book five where much of the potential action deferred should finally trigger.
0345803507|5.0|Very well written. It kept your interest throughout. The ending was great and so was the the summary. I would recommend this to read
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but this show honoring David Foster was simply amazing. This man has helped so many talented people become stars. He is also so very talented himself.
0345803485|5.0|After finishing this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on the other two in the trilogy. Very easy reading
0761171703|5.0|This book should be issued to all households.  Maybe when you get your drivers license or something.  A thing of beauty.
0345803493|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out in 2014. I wonder who the stars are going to be.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I &lt;3 this app. It is SOOOO much fun to play when u r bored. U can connect with ur friends. It is funner to play with them. In survival u have to stay alive by making houses and collecting objects from the world. In creative u can use ur imagination to build anything anywhere u want. So u should buy this app. Hope u have fun playing it. :D
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|The box is broken, Upset and dislike!<br /><br />It Should have better protection to protect the Lego Box, Lego Fans like to keep the box!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I enjoyed the reveal of the back story behind Treadstone and the enhanced agents.<br />Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are engaging and a joy to watch. The ending was sweet, hopeful and full of promise for future movies.
B005PK56TA|5.0|We thought this was a very interesting and entertaining program series overall.  Not very scary, but it has its momments.
B0035FQ1UU|4.0|I like apocalyptic end of the world movies. And anytime the destruction starts in LA it is even more enjoyable. The disaster sequences and visual effects are worth the price of admission.<br />The underlying themes will make you think.<br />There is a revealing look at the dynamics between the haves and the have nots around the world and the role the politicians play in deciding who will survive. There is an underlying religious theme and a questioning of ethics or lack thereof and mans inhumanity to man and how disaster brings out the worst in some and the best in others.<br />Not the typical disaster movie. Very enjoyable.
0345803485|2.0|I just finished reading this book today and I still don't understand why so many people \\"love\\" this book. The story line is very boring, the entire book is about erotica (BDSM), email, and sexual thoughts. It is an extremely long book (500+ pages), the longest I have read so far, and again BORING. I agree with most of the negative reviews but as we all can see some people just \\"LOVE\\" this book. I am debating whether or not to finish the trilogy because I can already see how the story will go. Just far warning for those to try it out, like I did, it will take some perseverance to get through this book.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Beautiful cinematography and a really likeable central character, are the cornerstones of this classic hero's tale. The young heroine leaves home and all she has ever known to journey in the outside world (as her father's weapon) which challenges all of her beliefs. She grows and becomes her own person through the course of her journey.<br /><br />If you look past the action veneer it is beautiful, thoughtful and philosophical.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series so far, I really enjoyed Mockingjay.  I can't wait to read Catching fire next....and then see the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addictive, once you start playing you can't stop playing!  The minions are so fun to watch.  Every new level is a exciting new adventure.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it is a great game I will recommended it to anybody s good to keep kids busy when they are getting on your nerve lol
055357342X|5.0|Story continues to intrigue.  I can't help loving the way he writes.  I like the way it makes this world real and the people in it believable.
B004EPZ070|5.0|If you love romance films with a touch of comedy then this is the perfect film for you! It's kind of underrated actually which is kind of sad.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addictive and fun. Good level of difficulty. Not too hard and not too easy. I hope I get more than ten levels.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|If you love Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, Predator, Predator 2, AVP: Alien Vs. Predator, AVPR: Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem, and/or Predators then you will love this film. I really hope they make a sequel I want to see more of these Engineers.
B0085OELXK|4.0|You watch this movie wondering &#34;is this where the other shoe drops?&#34; This is my second, third, etc., go-round with this movie and still elevates my anxiety. Jude, Matt, Gwyneth and Kate - the whole cast - do a splendid job! The playboy life never gets old... but can get you killed!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Buy this film and show it to everyone you know in fact just buy it for everyone you know! I would personally like to see Gremlins Vs. Critters someday!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got this for my mother who loves this type of show. She watched all the episodes and will probably watch them again.<br /><br />Its a great show!
B000067FP8|5.0|Why more sequels were never made I will never understand! If you ask me I think Gremlins Vs. Critters would be a great film!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is another wonderful story by Neil Gaiman that is artfully told and full of adventure. I would also suggest reading his graphic novel series Sandman.
B003LL3NOK|3.0|I honestly don't have much to say about this film. You will probably watch it once and then have no desire to watch it again. The dvd has a few good bonus features so that is always good.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Game lots of fun but not really mahjongg. It helps to know the game of mahjongg to match the tiles faster.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|Predator always got the bad end of the stick when it comes to the Alien and Predator universe. Hopefully more sequels come about that explain where they come from and how they reproduce. We already know enough about the Aliens haha. But if you like Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, Predator, Predator 2, AVP: Alien Vs. Predator, AVPR: Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem, and/or Prometheus then you definitely like this film it's worth a watch in fact it's worth a few watches!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|love the full features of facebook. the only problem I had was it contained too many unwanted ads that sucked my data up.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This is a ok game but I think it needs to be updated with  a not so lag app<br />It could be worse though
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like having the convenience of having e-bay where ever I go. I use it a lot when I am on the go.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u want a horse but cant afford one this is almost just like owning one! Love this game! I didn`t think i was going to like it but i really do!
B004SKQAJI|4.0|I saw this on TV once and liked it so I bought the DVD.  However, I have not watched it since I bought it.  Since I liked it on TV, chances are I will like it again.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We watched it last night and it left us happy through today.  I love the minions.  Graphics are very good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is Awesome I love this game I really love the soccer game. If you don't have this game get it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|So far as I can tell there's a handful of ok games, a few quality games, and mostly a bunch of junk on mobile devices so far. That being said, this is one of the quality games available to play for FREE. Give it a shot.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Loved the authors writing style but after reading three books I felt like alot of action was promised nothing actually happened.Quite droll.
0812589041|5.0|Had to read it quick because I kept wanting to know more. I am not into fiction but this was worth my time. I'm iffy about the movie that is coming out. Hope it isn't a disappointment.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This movie was recommended by a friend, and I was delighted to find it available at such a reasonable price. I have not received it yet.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This is a slick book full of twists and intense grit. Hard to get it out of your head once you finish, and hard to put down until you do! The author builds conflict and emotion. The book is populated by a hard bunch of hard characters - some I'd like to meet, and many I'd be afraid to! Recommended Read.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while. This movie is a must see. You will really enjoy this movie.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|This is one of those books that you'd love to see as a play. It's a real emotional drama that's well written and really shows the sides to a tragedy and what guilt, loss and blame can do to a family. It must have been tough to write but it's a pleasure to read.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I had this album on my wish list for a while, so when the price was right I downloaded it. The band has definitely put together an album worth listening to.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I appreciate the acting and the scenery in DA, but holy cow, writer(s), give the tragedy a break once in a while. These people can't have anything good happen to them without somebody dying from it.<br /><br />CL
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Any Christian who is engaged in the historical critical method has read these ideas before. Reza writes clearly and empathetically, and is on solid ground.<br /><br />I'm deeply offended by the FOX network anchor who challenged the validity of his assessment of the life of Jesus.<br /><br />Reza Aslan has every reason to raise the issues he raises, and his scholarship is beyond question. He is a respectful person who holds people of faith in high regard, even as he presents scholarly reasons for questions.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|I'm so glad I was able to discover this great talent. I was listening to NPR and heard her incredible voice. It was also mentioned the Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys co-wrote some of the songs and helped get this album made. I LOVE the Black Keys and you can hear the influence. This album is pure and fresh and she should have a long and successful career, she sure deserves it.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Had me laughing out loud, which I find books rarely can do. Emma was too funny, I couldn't book the book down, read it in one sitting.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|For some reason, my Kindle stopped running youtube videos. I entered the &#34;Chat help&#34; and worked with several agents.We managed to get it back to running videos. A few days later, it happened again. We fixed it. Then it happened again and so on... I believe I learned how to fix the problem w/o contacting anybody anymore. I believe itall boils down to SILK, not having an agreement with ADOBE FLASH PLAYER for its system and we uses have to &#34;patch&#34; the system every other day...  I am not sure whatthe problemis, but I am sure other tablets don't have to face this situation so frequently as I do.<br />Can I recommend this system?....  honestly, Ican't.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|This is a simple & relaxing game. Listen to the other reviewers and don't expect action pack or anything but more of a cinematic toned down game. It's a quick game but it awesome to look at and hear.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Don't tell me that this is the end.  More, more, I want more.  Suzanne Collins is good but this was, by far, her best.  You can't miss out on this trilogy.......
B007THA4FI|5.0|Outstanding book with heart<br /><br /> building beliveable characters we see in our own lives. Builds family and friend networks that jump out at you from the pages. I could not put this book down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't ready to quit when this one ended.  It was sheer torture waiting for Mockingjay to read.  The charactors in this book were well written and I felt like I knew them personally.  I missed them until they returned in 'Mockinjay'.
0385474547|3.0|I had to read this book for a college class last semester.  I was ahead of the class, so when I got to it I wasn't really pertaining to any schedule or listening to my professor's interpretation of it (which can kill a book for some people).  With that in mind, I'd say this was decent.  Okonkwo is a flat character, which some people have a problem with, but I think his character was meant to be an example of an extreme.  Okonkwo isn't a person; he's a personification of certain ideals, meaning that he lacks subtlety.  He is not the hero of the novel, though he is the protagonist.  His morals are being critiqued, I think, and that's really where the conflict comes from: the reader disagreeing with Okonkwo's decisions and understanding why they aren't right.  The novel is, therefore, not promoting violence and sexism, and I feel sorry for the people who are too shallow to realize that not every author stands beside his or her protagonist.<br /><br />That said, the story lacks an overarching conflict to help carry the reader through the story.  There is, essentially, no plot until the last fifty pages, so you'll have to, if you can, content yourself with the smaller moments that make up Okonkwo's life and try to appreciate the cultural insight Achebe is trying to give.  I had a hard time doing that, at least in some places, and I found myself plowing through the book instead of actually reading it.<br /><br />Achebe's prose is also hit or miss.  His style is incredibly straight forward and typically doesn't bother describing emotions.  This allows the reader to interpret the scenes based on physical descriptions, but it also leaves the narrative feeling very bare.  There is such a thing as being too direct when it comes to fiction writing.<br /><br />I think what many people aren't liking about this is that, really, it's an intellectual book.  It's meant for analyzing.  That shouldn't really scare you away; I'm not talking about the high school English teacher kind ofanalyzing where you discuss, at length, the meaning of Holden Caufield's left toenail, but the kind of analysis where you have to stop every now and then and chew on what's being written, the kind of analysis where you're taking what's written and applying it to the knowledge you have and you ask yourself, \\"Is this right, what's being said?\\"  It's about asking moral questions, and while it's not perfect at doing that, I do think it achieves its goal, just not in an entertaining way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I began reading 'The Hunger Games' but it didn't take long before I was burried so deep that I didn't hear the phone, doorbell or barking dogs.  QUIET EVERYONE.....................I'm reading.
B0091XI20C|5.0|I'm a fan of the HBO series, so I very much enjoyed the movie. This film is much better than the sequel.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child has created a wonderful hero to enjoy.  Every &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; book is spellbinding and 'A Wanted Man' is no different.  It was really hard to put down.  How can one man get himself in such a situation as this?  Even more - how can he expect to get OUT of it?
B00498YXG6|2.0|I enjoyed the first Sex and the City film, and love the HBO series, but this campy sequel is very disappointing.
0451232852|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It was easy to follow the many characters and their families.  I ended up spending way too much time researching and reading more about WW1, but maybe that is a good thing!  It made me want to delve into the history leading up to and during WW1.  My plan is to read all the books in the trilogy.  I would (and have already) recommended this book to friends and family.
B009CFZVR6|5.0|The American is one of my favorite films. Great film score (music); Engaging cinematography. Probably one of George Clooney's best roles. Not a typical &#34;Hollywood&#34; film - more like a high-budget independent film.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I believe that this is a highly addictive game and a possible update could be a street bike, similar to a motocross bike but faster on the highway level and more sleek and shiny. I think that would make the game better
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a nice app, giving you local conditions at a moment's notice and updating on extreme or emergency conditions as well. I recommend everyone get this app for their smart phone.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I was entertained from start to finish.  This book is a light hearted,  fun read.  If you're looking for something deep and thought provoking,  This won't be the book for you, but if you want a quick, silly  escape, this book will be perfect.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've had a Kindle now for almost 2 years and love the convenience of bringing a ton of books with me wherever I go.  Recently I got a smart phone and lo and behold, I could read books on it as well. So I downloaded the Kindle for Android app and then downloaded most of my books to my phone. Now I have one less gadget to carry around with me. I love that! Everyone should get this app. You never know when you will want to pass the time waiting by reading a good book!
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|This movie is an action type movie that could have been more realistic had it not been for the girl not trying to get away several times, knowing that if she did, she is as good as dead.  Would I see it again??  Probably not.
0399255370|5.0|\\"'The Day The Crayons Quit\\" is the best children's book I've seen in years!  Very creative twist on teaching kids the correct way to color and the proper use of colors. The fun truth of coloring!  More important, the book inspires indivual imagination and resourcefulness!<br /><br />Very impressed!  Waiting for the sequel!
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|I watched this directly after #1 and it filled the same craving for action and star packed action with so many well known faces, explosions, friends, and foes. I was shocked to see Bruce W and while he played a small part, it was still a nice addition to this film. I would suggest this film for anyone looking for a traditional shoot-em up film with many starz!
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|The controls work fine on my tablet, and the graphics are good enough. It seems like a pretty decent game especially for free.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed segments of this story. My main qualms are that at times the story seemed to drag, there wasn't enough character development to justify some of the relationships, and I felt like the story was just beginning right when it ended! I do feel like the characters have some major potential and the storyline is about to get vastly more exciting, so I am looking forward to reading the next installment.
B009CPE424|5.0|The kids really enjoyed it and it was good for several laughs. It was a real cute kids movie. It had a nice story line too.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Very good read about the French Resistance and so interesting and clever in the way these women undertook their mission!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is fun to explore the rooms and put the pieces together to get out of each room.  A good distracting way to be lazy!
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|It is interesting to watch a movie that is responsible for much cliche' in a genre. The birth of so much of it starts here. After watching this film, even Scorsese's own movie Casino seemed like a cliche'!
B001NA6096|4.0|hard to find a movie that can keep your attention with basically two people talking and minimal action, somehow they did just that !!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought the ending was rather abrupt.  The plot was fascinating!!!!! From page to page, it grew more convoluted and mysterious.....
B0079KGAOY|3.0|Okay, will make this short and sweet.  I was at BEST BUY and saw a LETHAL WEAPON 4 pack (looking like a typical 4-pack cover with every movie poster squared on the cover.)  I was dubious, because it was 19.99, and it was in a smallish blu ray case, but I bought it - and lo and behold - it held 4 discs, with each flim getting its own disc - I was encouraged.  I brought it home.  The Lethal Weapon looked slightly better than the DVD - in other words - not a great remastering at first blush, but better looking, as they all are - than the dvd counterparts - i have not A/B'd the audio yet but I know on part one there is no director's commentary but there are on the other three.  They all seem to be the basic WB discs that were released way back when with the same features - only these are the theatrical (and better - in my opinion) than the director's cuts - which I thought added repetetive and really unnessassary scenes.  So then I stick in LETHAL PART 2 and whoa and behold - it's a blu-ray of SWORDFISH!!!!!!!  This wasn't even used - it was brand new - anyway - 3 and 4 seem to be fine, - and the packaging is awful - 4 discs in a 2 disc box that has you \\"stacking.\\"  It's all ok, and I'll return it for the right set, but for 20 bucks- - it's a bargain on blu ray to have the whole thing - BUT - the bigger issue is that LETHAL WEAPON was a great and important set of films in the cop -movie pantheon (especially the brilliant first 2 - the 3rd is not a great movie, barely a good one - and 4 is slightly better but even more misbegotten - but they are still enjoyable if you like those characters with all the dangerous aspects taken out of them) - So I would say to get this set if you see it, but be prepared to be underwhelmed with a barely -there remaster job, a typical 5.1 track and it's just not getting the justice these movies deserve.
B007ZYJT1U|2.0|I have to admit I couldn't finish watching this film. It just seems like another example of a film being unrealistically depressing and grotesque. Maybe this is real life for some people but not the type of people who watch digital movies on Amazon. Perhaps all of the pain and desperation it will inflict upon you pays off in the end but I had to turn it off after 20 minutes because it was just like staring at a festering sore and calling it art.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I had seen the TV series, but wanted to read this book to get the true feeling of the events.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love this game. I. Can challenge myself. Makes my thought process keep active and quick. I also have started grandson on it when he was almost age 3. Now he is a whiz and faster than Nana.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how its a little harder than temple run and that the minions are in this game. Its fun and addicting.
B000VHMF0A|4.0|He is the legend!  Love this collection, a good addition to my music collection!  Reminds me of my sailing days in the carribbenn.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Season 2 was a great season with the introduction of the others and Ben. By far it was the best season.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I loved this game growning up in Texas, Now its on my Kindle soooo happy I got it. Get it!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|There seems to be no way to get a pretty hair style.  You just move sections of pixels around.  I guess if you like minecraft this is the styling game for you.
1451627297|4.0|not finished reading it yet but been glued to it since starting. Story is an interesting mix of previous King stories and characters which appear randomly. Looks like another hit for the master
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed watching especially at dinner time.<br />It made me wish I had someone to serve dinner for me but we all must<br />dream and Downton Abby lets me do just that.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This version comes with additional tracks that really round out the experience of the film.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Howard Shore scores from the original trilogy, as it is better than you would expect and does not disappoint.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The story would be completely different if told from Ma's perspective.  As a mother of a five-year-old I found Jack's view of the world so moving.  Despite his circumstances, his mother made his world a good one.  It made me think about how much could be accomplished developmentally and emotionally with a child with so much time and attention focused on him from birth to age five - even with few resources.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I am old enough to be Matthew Macfadyen's mother but I am in love with him and his acting skills, not only in this movie but also his portrayal of all his characters.  Kiera Knightly is enchanting as Elizabeth Bennett along with great casting of all the other actors and actresses.  It might not encompass all the storylines in the book but it has captured the essence of a great love story.  I can't watch it enough!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I found this book to be easy to read and difficult to put down. I loved the magical qualities of the book that intermingled so well with the childhood imagination and innocence of the main character.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have to admit- the beginning is a bit long winded; but it is all to subtly suck you in. The imagery is incredible and the characters are fully developed. The best part of this book (besides the incredible plot) is that the author designed the book with segments where you as the reader feel like you are in the circus.<br />If you have the patience to get through the first third of it go the extra mile. It is that good.<br />Must Read!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This series is great! Danearys was awesome and the actress really played her well. I loved Tyrion and I'm looking forward to watching season 3
B003ODKZZU|5.0|One of my very favorite albums. So happy to have it on vinyl now. The record sleeve was a little damaged, but not terrible so.
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|Fantastic excitement breath taking<br />Keep you on the eadge of you seat,the color spectrum and sound are great you'll love it.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|The movie was great but the damn cover gives away the ending! Grrr! Very good story, very good acting, but again...if you just looked at the cover then a quarter of the way through you will know how it ends!
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I tried to watch it when it first came out but it was confusing, but it has been in my mind and I finally watched it and I loved it. It will always be in my mind, a great story of life and love
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Best album to come out in a long time where every song is an inspiration. Emeli is a class act. Can't wait to see her in concert!
B005DD7H50|5.0|I wish I had the ability to access all of my mind and literally be the best I possibly can. It reminds me of Kyle XY, so fans of that, I think would love this.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|This movie sounded like it could be crap but it is very entertaining.  Abe looks and sounds like a young Liam Neeson.  Jimmi Simpson is strange-looking as always and Rufus Sewell's softspokenness is finally used in an interesting way.  I am familiar with the director's previous hits in Russia so he does have an artistic eye but there is a music video quality to his work - you know, kind of express train to the point.  It's kind of live action interpretation of comic book pacing.<br /><br />The best thing is how horrible the vamp morph faces are.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed the mystery and adventure.  What fun.  It is a challenge but not difficult.<br />Find the tools and discover how to use them to open the elevator and get out of the room.
B005LAIGQ4|3.0|I watched the first few years of that Rob Morrow Janine Turner show when it was cute and charming and this is Alaska muted and taken as a matter of course - no longer outre'.  There is some broad acting all around from Veronica Mars, that guy from The Office or some other NBC sitcom and Drew Barrymore looking realistically unkempt from being far from Metropolis.  I wouldn't say that this movie was enjoyable - it was just okay but the closeups of the whales were nice and of course, it had me thinking of that whole Whale Wars or Whale Wh0res situation that is often on the news.  There's no money in it, just sadism and an excuse for spy ships to be in international waters despite protests by the Australian government.
B0079LJZG8|1.0|Also, really hard to follow mostly because I didn't know why I should care. Apparently there is some back story.  I would only recommend this to people who already likes it otherwise it's really boring.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Well, I think it is ok but not really necessary.  The older version worked just fine and really not the best gadget to have in my pocket.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is such an addicting game. It took a little bit to get the hang of things, especially the battles and beating my high score but overall is a fun game. Wish there were more ways to earn tokens though!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just watch it. Of course if you're looking at season three that's probably a nonissue. But in case it is: just watch it already!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent cast, excellent plots for each episode and all round superb acting. Every episode seems to better the previous one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Kids love the game they play it all day long I even get addicted to it and its a fun game to play
B000002O4X|5.0|This sound track from the movie, Out of Africa, is so inspiring and beautiful to listen to.  I play it over and over again and soothes the soul!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|When I talk to friends about this game they always compare it to Temple Run. When I got the game and actually started playing I realized that its not as similar to Temple Run as people say it is. Yes it has its similarities, your being chased you need to avoid obstacles and collect coins. However, the way you play the two games is very different. I like this game because at first your not very good but each time you play you start getting better and you learn different tricks to survive longer. Subway Surfers keeps me interested because they have missions for you to complete, and goals to reach.
B0061QD88S|5.0|This movie is a classic! I am so glad I was able to find it. I had done some price shopping and Amazon had the best price.  As usual.
B000FC146C|2.0|It is with some trepidation that I venture any criticism for this best seller. I read bits of this years ago but it was hard going for me then and much harder now, although I read it in its entirety. This time was on Kindle. The Kindle technical reproduction was excellent - someone seems to be getting their act together - otherwise I would have deep-sixed it.<br /><br />But I find the male characters in this book are drawn almost as caricatures.  The old man is a tyranical  master to his wife and family and his sister who asks him to be her head man with the suggested promise of inheritance is a bitch in my view. The fact that anyone would leave a large sheep station to the RC church as opposed to family is obscene, in my view.  I find the description of men as \\"beautiful\\" has to be a feminine perspective and I find the whole RC thing with respect to the lead male character and his bastard son as hard to credit. As far as the machinations of the RC crowd, particularly the Vatican, I find them, as usual for me, repulsive.  Anyone with any common sense and guts would have turned in his papers if he loved a woman that much.<br /><br />I had much the same problems with the miniseries and could only watch one  episode.<br /><br />This is definitely a woman's book - no, a very religious woman's book.<br /><br />The descriptions of an outstation are well-drawn - I got thirsty just reading them.
1592402038|1.0|I am a stickler for punctuation, and I was hoping to enjoy this book.  Unfortunately the author's writing style is convoluted and unreadable.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|My Granddaughter loves this movie.  Thanks.  I loved it too when it first came out. I have nothing else to say
B00CCEHX5W|3.0|Great potential here and since they are a California band they know all about deriving success through copying.  At their best they sound like better pieces of catherine wheel and MBV, at their worst the typical black metal vocal screechings evoke little beyond the angst of 14 year old boys holed up in their bedrooms.<br />I live in ofallon mo where all these rich republican kids all think a guitar they can beat up while screeching makes them qualified to play black metal. I guess it does but it evokes yawns more than acceptance.<br />This band might even break out of the black metal hole they have dug and their audience of 5 if they keep musically deriving the shoegazing metal waves of sound their music at its best evokes.  Otherwise they will remain pretty much a typical screeching band stuck in a nowhere musical genre.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi is Jimi.  We all know who he is and what he does.  It is wonderful to have new music and listen to him play something fresh.  This music holds up well considering it is blues/rock based.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Graphics are great on my kindle fire hd. Downloaded the game for my little sister and I ended up playing. I'm 25... enough said.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|the first half is classic. pure classic. R. Lee Ermey is more than greatness as the drill sergeant. (duh). even the second half is good. but, what makes this movie is the first half.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game and well worth the money to get the full version. will def be getting jewel quest two when it comes out
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather, what is there to say? how can anybody NOT like this masterpiece??? sure, the third one is not as great as Part One and Two, but, still : its greatness.
B000087EY0|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and wanted it to be a learning tool which it has turned out to be, he can interact with what is on the screen. he is two and is very smart and I am sure this will help him to read faster..
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|great sequel. really.  you love gore? action? feeling uneasy? then, this is for you. i thought it was cool that Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi was a part of this. and wait till after the credits.
6304696558|5.0|5 stars★<br /><br />I think Goldie Hawn is great in this movie. The role seemed to have been made for her. It's a cute satire military movie. The boot camp scenes are nice and were near like my boot camp experience in the Navy. But then, I doubt Goldie would still play the role as Private Benjamin if she had to chop off her hair. I think Eileen Brennan is great in this role as well. Eileen, \\"The Couch\\" and Goldie is the reason why we rewatch this film. TMC channel was showing it today to celebrate Eileen's career because she passed away on July 28th (my birthday actually - kind of dampers that).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was awesome.  I am so looking forward to another season.  I binge watched Season 3.  What a great story line.  I can sort of relate to the story as I am a senior member of society and sometimes feel like the dowager, i.e., the world it is a changing.
B00003CY0V|3.0|I think this movie tried use the 90's computer hacking popularity. This movie is in no way as good as the great hacker movies like Hackers, Sneakers and The Matrix. The problem with Swordfish is that it's confusing as heck. This is the first time I've watched it straight through. But I still missed little bits of this movie. It has big star actors but that still didn't keep my interest, so I've been doing chores that needed finishing and socializing on here. Hugh Jackman looks good in this and Halle Berry shows off her underwear (the 0.5 star for Hugh naked with a towel rapped around him). But these nearly nude scenes still didn't keep my interest or keep me from being confused. Halle and Hugh are better fitted in the X-Men movie. And Hugh has way more muscle in The Wolverine then this confusing movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show! Very refreshing to see a good and clean drama. I started out watching the first season on a whim because I'd heard how great it was, and quickly became hooked! Can hardly wait for season 4!
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I don't think I liked this more then the first movie. It was cute and funny. My 10 and 8 y.o. cousins certainly liked it. I didn't see the movie with my 3 y.o. niece (who turned 3 today - time is going by too fast). My sister (her mom) asked if she should see it, and I think that there is indeed one part that she might be afraid of (big purple monster). But that's only because it looked like one of the monsters from Monsters, Inc., which Evan got scared of. But, there was a 2 1/2 y.o. boy who loved the movie who also loved Monsters, Inc. So to each kid there own. I'd probably see this again on the cable or something. Sis is still debating if she wants to take Evan because that girl looovvvveessss the Minions. I think she'll like the Minion movie more probably.<br /><br />Funny thing is that our theater was having problems with the sound and stopped the movie in the middle of the show. The theater staff explained the pause - but no one seemed to understand what the problem was. Turned out there was a heart beat sound throughout the movie. They tried to fix it, but I still noticed the beat. So staff worker ended up passing out free movie guest passes. So, Wo Ho!! Free Movie! I feel lucky. Second time this year that I saw an animated movie where the theater had problems, thus having to give out refunds.
B002MFULQO|5.0|At what may be the REAL story behind what happened to JFK and the country at the time of his assasination.
B0090SI56Y|5.0|5 stars★<br /><br />This was better then the other Wolverine movie. And although it carries on with Wolverine's storyline, the timeline is after X-Men: The Last Stand. So in order to understand the timeline and what happened to Jean Grey character, then you'd need to watch that movie. In all they've had 6 X-Men movies with 2 more promised. I'm not complaining. In fact, I think The Wolverine movie is doing well in keeping fans and newbies interested in the series. There was a lot of action and shirtless Hugh Jackman scenes. (My mom could've sworn she heard Hugh say in interviews that this movie was the last time he'd have the chance to be shirtless. I'm not sure if that's true or what). This movie was definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Having the movie take place in Japan was good with some nostalgia of my Navy day visits to Japan.<br /><br />Rewatched it again on the theatrical release edition and I still love it.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This is an ok game, and is a good first person shooter. Unfortunately, it is a freemium game. Though it is free, it's hard to continue without spending some cash.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|For those (like myself) who get scared easily (slightly or full on jump out of their sets or turn their heads and plug their ears)... well, this movie only had one part that I considered scary. But now I can't even recall what that was.<br /><br />This did remind me of the movie series Aliens but those were so much better then this. I think they even recycled some of the alien creatures and \\"space ships\\" for Prometheus.  I later learned that this is a prequel to the Alien series.  And that they're making another prequel movie - which I don't think I'll be watching.<br /><br />I didn't recognize who played the Doctor that survived (and got pregnant with an alien baby - same as Sigouney's character).  I didn't like her and found her to be annoying. Weaver did a much better job at playing the female superhero.  It wasn't until later that I realized the Doc played Lisbeth in the foreign movies to The Millinium series (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Hornet's Nest and Played with Fire).  I like the actress but I'm still not liking her role in this.<br /><br />The acting was mediocre, and I am a fan of both Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron - they're the only reason why I continued watching it.<br />I just wanted to see Michael and Charlize act in this and thought they both did good with what very little they had to work with. And I mean very little. Everything else was mediocre. I didn't even recognize Guy Pearce, who did just ok. Would I watch the complete movie? No. And this isn't sequel worthy also.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|star trek in black and white? not what i ordered. saw the movie in color. thought dvd would also be in color
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great HD visuals, lots of creative tile arrangements- getting my daily \\"fix\\" of Mahjong & keeping that brain sharp as I ENTER MY 60's!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is great!!! I'm a girl and I play it with my 7 yr old brother. The game IS for kids of ALL AGES. There's some whacky stuff and jetpacks. Like the description for the laser jet pack is pretty funny: flying with this jetpack is the easy part. Not burning your pants off while flying is the hard part. LOL! I've bought most of the jetpack and gadgets. YOU CAN ALSO GET A DOG GADGET!!!!! His name's flash he's a robot dog and indestructable if you remove him there will be missing dog signs in every sector for two runs. LOL!!! : )
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This fame is fantastic and slightly creepy, but it is highly variable and dynamic with 10 different infections each with unique playstyles and abilities, 30 genes for customizability, starting the game in any country, some randomness, 3 difficulty levels and lots of strategy, it's a new game everytime. Get it!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I was up until early morning hours reading this. I just couldn't put my Kindle down. I decided to read the first book since I saw the Lightning Thief. Going to see Sea of Monsters and read the book! Beautifully written. 5 stars for a great job, well done!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow it blows me away with updades included free and a creative mode option it's so awesome I had to write a review for me it's on 7.3 and on 8.0 hopefully there will be infaniant world's that's right no limits just like pc version
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This is a good product.  I use it every day.  I seem to have a little trouble with battery charging.  I am working on troubleshooting.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Loved it.....great story line and awesome cast. Walter is a fantastic caricature.  Can wait to watch the complete series. Thanks amazon prime.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun for my niece and I really had fun working together and solving the rooms. We can't wait for the next level
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This version of the game stays true to the original card game and I really enjoy playing it. Very well done!
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|and I do not use those words lightly.  See it, but familiarize yourself with the story so you are not lost from the beginning.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not a bad game....fun to play.  Great to play while you have a few minutes of time. The only thing I would like to see is that you could earn more tokens to buy the expansions of land sooner.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|This was a fast read. It was not bad at all, just not wow inducing. I appreciate the fact that she talked about the heroin use. I think a lot of folks would have left that out. You never know, it may help another young, lost soul work it out.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|The local Radio Shack gave me a blank stare. I found this piece within moments on Amazon and it worked perfectly.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|Awesome movie! Definately a movie that never gets old, you can watch it over and over and always catch something new
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I have many games o my phone but this is one of those that I keep coming back to again and again.it's also got a very nice clean interface and the music is fitting
0060899190|5.0|All over the globe of human nature.<br />As a writer, a source I wil go back to again and again.<br />nancy merz
0307744434|5.0|I really liked this book, it was so magical and written so well.  It was easy to see what the author was trying to get across and I found it to be extremely enjoyable.  My favorite read this summer so far.
0385349947|2.0|Sandberg's media tour implied that her book would, among other skills, better inform the reader as to how to negotiate for the best salaries of a given offer/job level.Instead, I read ONLY this: she went back to her husband with what she had as prospective offers and her husband essentially, told her what to ask for.That does not encourage women to move past what their husbands advise them to do. The book promised much more than it delivered in depth, substance, and was in my opinion, on a par with Barack Obams's books pre presidential run.<br />nancy merz
B000KX0HVY|5.0|Purchased this because it came with an instant download AND the cd AND it was cheaper than the strictly digital copy amazon offers. Plus free shipping with prime!
B009Y61ZMI|5.0|I have liked this movie since the first time I viewed it. This is my 20+ time (I own it on VHS). I also like most Kurt Russell movies. The action is satisfying for a former soldier.
6305692572|4.0|Their is a kissing scene at the end that was weird, but otherwise a good movie. Probably pretty true to life.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Now Fantasy is my Forte, i love it, so i was proper stoked to read this book by William O'brien.<br />Life for Peter is about to change on his 10th birthday, Peter is transported to the darkened realm where he embarks on a journey all the while under the eyes of the evil Bonemaker who can make skeletons and has nasty elves that do his every bidding. In his travels there are spirits who can steal Peter away and he doesn't know where he'll end up, his main task is to save the Shylong with some golden flakes.<br />It's strange and quite a journey for a young kid to make but all the time we don't know if Peter is alive or dead either, so we don't know if he will ever make it back William is a great fantasy spinner and deserves to be up with the best haven't enjoyed a book like this since the earlier Discworld novels so i hope to read more by this author in the future.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great value, good price! We only needed one; however, at this price, it was a no brainer to get the whole packet.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I became interested in Rodriguez after seeing Searching for Sugarman.  Some of the songs seem dated - very 70s.  Others are really timeless.  Definitely a good addition to the collection.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I liked the story and the way it flowed.  I am looking forward to obtaining the other books in this series because I found this one enjoyable reading.
B000001ESF|5.0|I've been looking in our used/new stores for this album for several years.  I should have started here and not wasted time.
1932735410|4.0|Good to help drill down on details needed for the test.  Well organized, and I liked the exercises and tips.
B000VE439Y|5.0|Sacrilegious, but absolutely hilarious.  I haven't seen this film in years, so it was about time to pick it up for old times sake.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|Have read it many times over the years. Always something new to think about.  Very interesting characters, surprisingly modern situations.
0486408434|5.0|This is a great starting point for amateur magicians or a good review for seasoned professionals. Each chapter builds on the last and it is clearly explained
B004NIFK9Q|5.0|Great to read again for completely different perspective than reading as a high school student.  It's a classic for good reason.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is definitely a \\"coming of age\\" film for those of us 60ish plus.  I had no idea what to expect when I saw the title \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" come up on HBO's list of movies...but with Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Judi Dench I knew it wasn't something to take lightly.  I was hooked by the time that fabulous score took off in the airport lounge, and I was soaring right with it.  The pacing of the film, the score, the photography, the casting--superb.<br /><br />My hat is off especially to Penelope Wilton, who gave a pitch-perfect portrayal of a \\"Brit control-freak\\" barely holding it together with that British stiff upper lip.  I suppose the term \\"seriocomic\\" could be used to describe her performance, since this is definitely not a tense, dramatic film--but the way she was able to craft her character, who finally came to terms with who she had been/was being, and was able to let go, was emotionally so satisfying to feel and watch.<br /><br />At age 67, I could absolutely imagine myself in every moment of this film--and wished I was.  I have mentioned it to friends who are under 50 who do not seem interested in seeing it--so perhaps it speaks more to those of us who have gone beyond trying to succeed in this success-driven society, living inauthentic lives to a greater or lesser extent.<br /><br />I have watched Marigold Hotel at least half a dozen times and will no doubt continue to watch it many times more.  It feeds my soul.  Thank you to all of you who made it.  A mitzvah.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I've never read this book when I was younger. So, I wanted to read it. Despite the fact that I know how things end for Anne and her family, the book us very enjoyable to read. I really like Anne and love her spunk. It's such a shame that she didn't get the chance to live out the ret of her life and fulfill all the dreams she talks about wanting to do in this book. She was a real hoot! The world lost out on having a good person grow up in it and contribute to society.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Loved Anita's story about her NDE and the implications of what she shares for my own life. It is well told and isn't another guru book  talking about theory or ideas. It is real life experience that clearly explains what happens when we die and that there is nothing to fear in life. I feel revitalised and also at peace with everything that is now happening in my own life.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|I've only had time to read the beginning. But, it's a very interesting book so far. He delves into the science of the subconscious mind and talks about how you (your brain) may know something isn't right long before you become consciously aware of it. Looking forward to reading the rest of it.
0756407125|5.0|This is by far one of the best fantasy series I have had the fortune to read in the last five years. I love Patrick Rothfuss's style. His character depth is unlike any I have been exposed to recently. His protagonist Kvothe is a character that is equally someone to awe and grapple to understand. While I do not believe Kvothe is actually a likable man, his adventures span over a thousand pages thus far and you keep fighting for his character to win against his many trials.
B004S5FWEC|5.0|True baldacci style<br />A roller coaster read<br />Looking forward to the next book in what seems to be a series
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was awesome and the new up grades are even better. I really like the new jump boost thing it was so cool riding it.
0143038419|5.0|I immensly enjoyed the countries visited .  Makes you want to jump on a plane and join her!  If you enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun, you will love this book equily as well
B0073COMKW|5.0|I purchased these bulbs for my non-dimmable downward facing can fixtures, and absolutely love them!  They do a good job of directing the light downwards and not to the sides where it would just be wasted.  The brightness and lumens/watt are both respectable.  They are silent.  What else is there to want?<br /><br />A year ago I thought my Eco-Smart Home Depot bulbs (8W, 540 lumens, 3000K, $10)  were a great deal.  These make those look pretty lame!<br /><br />For a low cost bulb, if you like 3000K, you can't go wrong here!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This should be in every Pink Floyd fans possession. Enjoy watching over n over. A must have... A live concert recording not interrupted by audio commentary. Awesome...
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this and would recommend it to everyone!!!!  Anyone who thinks they are a victim of life might just change their minds when they are finished with this book, if they finish it.  Actually if they only do the first few exercises.  It's amazing.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Can't wait to see the rest . I'm a big David Tennant fan and recognize many of the other cast and enjoy their preformances as well, it looks to be a great series.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Locked up both my phone and my kindle fire.. Had to remove it.. I guess the graphics overloaded everything.. Too bad because it was a cute game
B0097HSS4M|4.0|It is a early version of the Aviry-&quot;free&quot; photo editor. The best part of that editor is in this application. I recommend it.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|This was not a very good film.  Unfortunate, as the book was very good and readable and I expected much more.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|At the first moment it looks simple, but after the very first level it is the labyrinth. Good nerves and good nerves! You will enjoy playing this game, after every level I am the winner! Real one. Not too hard, but you will not watch TV and play this game. You will forget TV! Great game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have played temple run and two other versions of that game. Out of them all this is better and more entertaining than temple run.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|This is not chess or sudoku, but if you like them, solitaire and that kind of a games, this is perfect moment to remember or learn this game. I really enjoy in it. It is simple to learn, but not simple to play. Thanks Good there are undo button. I like games where my brain, not my reflex is in priority.<br />Unfortunately I am 26 years old, second time, but fortune is they I enjoy in this kind of games. I'm playing with my family sometime too, but it is much better to play alone.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|I was so looking forward to Bram Stoker's Dracula and got it for free from Kindle download!  I nestled into my bed and opened the first chapter and was fully expecting to be enthralled by its contents.  And if I had, for one moment, enjoyed reading a book written entirely in diary entries, journals, letters or newspaper clippings then I am sure I would have loved this book.<br /><br />Yikes!  I didn't know authors did this.  I have read so many books in the past that have dialogue in it that I was a bit surprised that this one was really, really, skimpy on it.  It's a boring read and I'd say save your money, but this was free to me so download away.  But don't expect too much talk.  Oh, there was one fellow - a one hundred year old sailor - who had some sort of accent Stoker was trying to pen to paper.  I've no idea what the guy was talking about because it made no sense so I skipped that part - maybe that's why he didn't write any dialogue - he wasn't good at it?  (I was wrong about the dialogue.  He was good at it but it's very lengthy in most parts.  Except for when Van Helsing is speaking.  I'm not sure what kind of accent Stoker was trying to give him as it didn't come across very well - to me, anyway.)<br /><br />I should mention that a lot of the reviewers absolutely loved the way Stoker wrote this book.  I'm not one of them.  I need the dialogue to make the story move along.<br /><br />New entry:  So far I have read about 63% of this book and Stoker has drawn out parts of it which isn't really interesting to me.  Now, this may be due to the fact that at the time he wrote this there wasn't much in the way of cheap entertainment so reading a book would fill a void, so to speak.  And I think that parts of it are shocking for readers of any time period.  For example, Renfield eating bugs.  Yuk.  But another reviewer indicated that there was a lot of blood and guts in this book and unless it's in the final 37%, I haven't come across anything too horrific yet.<br/><br />My review of this book for others is to be aware that this was written over a hundred years ago so please read it with that in mind.  For example:  Alexander Dumas wrote The Count of Monte Cristo in 1844; Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock Holmes mysteries from 1887-1927; Bram Stoker wrote Dracula in 1897.  Also, Francis Ford Coppola made the Dracula movie in 1992 with Gary Oldman, Keeanu Reeves, Wynona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins.  To date, this movie is the closest re-enactment, as it were, to Stoker's original book of Dracula.  (Although it's really not a very good movie.)<br /><br />Dracula is not like most of the fast-paced novels of today.  Perhaps I am being overly-critical of a writer who, in his time, was one of the first novelists who wrote of supernatural beings (as far as I know).  Beings who are now, in this time period, overly everything.
B00AVFO41K|5.0|Not to think, just to play. You have to get together at least five balls in the same color. They explode and the board is empty in the beginning, for a new combination. That's all of rules, that's beginning of fun. Realty nice.
0307474259|5.0|I have lost over 80 pounds in the last 8 1/2 months and this book is the Bible if you want to learn why we get fat and how to correct it.I can't say enough good things about it.Buyit,read it until you understand it and you will not regret it.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Both single player and multi player are good.  Special powers keep it interesting. I played it like mad when I first got it, but even after the initial wow wore off, it's still a great game to spend a few minutes with, every once in a while.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|While I was originally a fan of the TV series, the books are better, as is typically the case. I've read the first two so far and I have to say I'm impressed. They are well written, witty, exciting, and actually made me chuckle a few times.<br />For me to give this anything less than a 5 out of 5 would be an injustice.
B001NAT07A|4.0|Super heroes don't always have to be males. Cat Women and Wonder Women always catch the bad guys with style!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series. It is completely entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable. I can't wait to see Season 3 which I just bought.
B00499NHLC|3.0|Not only does this guy know everything, he is always right on time.  Sherlock is still one of the best detective around.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|kept me spellbound all through it. as an avid eagle fan, it is the ultimate tribute. nice to have in my library
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|This movie did not at all live up to its predecessor.  It was drawnout, and in various places almost ridiculous. I would not recommend this item to others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|interesting and keeps you thinking. got stuck once got some help from youtube. but looking forward to more . even though this was free I'd buy the next time
3836538725|5.0|This is the kind of book you treasure. Like a fine piece of music, every time you pick up this book, you will find new images you like, images that move you, images that often leave you breathless, and you really see Salgado as the true artist he is.<br />I bought this book because I cannot afford the huge, oversized limited edition of this book. It costs $10,000 !!<br />Yikes!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|An idea that would make more good films. Wish there were more like it. Not easy to follow if you aren't paying attention.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very good game so far. I'm still in the beginning but I can already tell it's going to be awesome. Graphics, plot, and storyline are all amazing.
0451213092|3.0|The book is well written but dry reading.  If you get excited reading a history book then this is for you.
140006922X|1.0|No documentation of sources.  In trying to support a premise of any kind, an author's sources are not only essential but mandatory.  This glaring omission is, without a single doubt, deliberate considering the authors academic background.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far so good. Passes the time and challenging enough. For a free app it holds your attention. Try it out.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Also gives insight into Afghanistan's culture, and its people, and the changes going on from the war. Very, very moving.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This film has spawned a world of opinions surrounding its plot.  I believe this film will b recognized as Sci if masterpiece.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Death Comes to Pemberly is the perfect sequel to Pride and Prejudice. Author PD James has written and intriguing novel that meshes beautifully with the language and story content of Jane Austen's original. Would love a sequel to this one!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids love it. They play it always. Really easy to play. The animation is enjoyable and exciting. Very pleasinh.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A great place to combine interesting things in your life and for others to enjoy them too.  Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yes . . . you can have a Zombie movie WITH a good plot!  Starts a little bit slow . . . but then it just gets better and better.  A meet and come together &#34;family&#34; struggling to keep alive during this terrible Zombie time.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this app if you like cards games then this is the game for you I play it everywhere every chance I get
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|T his game is very mind challenging. Wish it lasted a little longer but was great while e it did. Can't wait for the next chapter.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Another excellent series by HBO good storyline great characters episodes feel like they are over in 20 minutes not 60 minutes
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Absolutely love Coldplay. Perfect CD. Perfect condition. Perfect price. Was a birthday gift for a friend and I definitely cannot complain about this purchase.
B00004R99F|5.0|There are those that will claim to dislike the film due to one scene (slapping Lester), and totally miss the moral of the story:  You need to spend time with your kids, even doing things they think are corny, as you strive to move from a parent-child relationship to an adult relationship.  Each family is different, and what works for me and my sons may not work for you and yours, but you need to keep trying.  Spending time on vacations, sharing responsibilities and decisions, doing things they like to do, doing things I want to do, make fond memories for me and my college-age son.  Great music, great story line, great interaction between dad and son as they seek common ground.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|well written with fast action and enough twists to keep you in the dark about who done it until almost to the end.  Lots of references to familiar places in Oslo.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It is the mystery series that defined a genre for more than a century.<br />If you have not heard of Sherlock Holmes and/or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle this review would be of no help to you.<br /><br />Now on the Kindle, this world heritage classic can be read practically anywhere, any time.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I like it but it is really slow and it tests your patience alot but it is really fun and I do regimens it but only if you have paitence
0767919408|5.0|\\"One Summer\\" is a pleasure to read and almost impossible to put down.  Bill Bryson pulls together the events of the summer of 1927 in a sprawling tale that weaves together truly inept criminals, the rise of Charles Lindbergh, a horrendous flood, Babe Ruth's incredible career, the power of baseball in America, and even the legal maneuverings that would ultimately bring down Al Capone. Bill Bryson is a gifted writer, and this book is an intelligent and yet easily accessible reporting of events, with a wonderful dose of humor thrown in. He injects observations and details that make the stories richer and more interesting.  Here's one quick example of his wit and dry humor: in describing Jacob Ruppert, who purchased the New York Yankees, he writes, \\"Ruppert's most arresting peccadillo was that he kept a second home in Garrison, New York, where he maintained a shrine to his mother in the form of a room containing everything she would need if she came back to life. This may go some way towards explaining why he never married.\\"<br /><br />What is particularly interesting is discovering that as the trite saying goes, \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\"  Bryson's coverage of journalism during that period makes the reader realize that today's arguments about tabloid versus real journalism are just continuations of arguments that clearly have been going on for decades. A man blows up a school and kills over 40 children-- all to protest paying taxes. Traffic is congested in New York City. Politicians-- well, they're not unlike today's politicians. Relations between America and France aren't much better now. And Jay Leno would have no trouble identifying stupid criminals.<br /><br />I found myself constantly hoping that a movie director would read this book and seize upon even one of the many stories that make up this period in time.  I was surprised, for instance, to learn that it was through the work of a tenacious female lawyer, Mabel Walker Willebrandt, that the first laws were put on the books which allowed the IRS to go after gangsters like Capone. Somehow her story (to my knowledge) has never appeared in any of the many \\"Untouchable\\" type movies and TV series. Someone should track down her story and bring it to the screen.<br /><br />Readers will be entertained and informed by this charming and engaging book.  Just a warning: once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down. It's that addictive.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is great for the kids they love playing and building their own town and city. Very very good
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Excellent story with a great twist at the end, as usual. But I think the story was a little bit drawn out and could have been just a little bit shorter.
B005K17RU0|4.0|APP was a 5 now a 3. I prefer the old format. This one is kind of klunky. Great for the price (free) but would like my old APP back. Will search for a better option. The old App was easy to use... loved it!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Honestly, who buys $99.99 worth of &#34;coins&#34; to use in an app?  Yes, it's true - be aware that you can actually spend that much money with one click in this game!  This did not happen to me, thankfully!  But, no game is that fun, this one included.  However, if you really like MLP, go for it as it is super-cute.  If you do not plan to spend any actual money, you will be able to achieve many of the ponies without cash, but not all.  Also, in the interest of playing the game, I did have to change the date on my Kindle many times to get enough &#34;coins&#34; for play...otherwise, it moved very slowly.
