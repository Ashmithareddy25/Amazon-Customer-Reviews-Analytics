B00C0PEAM2|5.0|Not writing much of a review here.  Just giving it my 5 stars - for both seasons 1 and 2. I first became aware of the series from some of the TV ads but I didn't pay much attention. I DID glimpse Robert Carlyle in those ads and I thought, \\"oh darn, HE isn't in ANYTHING bad but I am NOT going to get HOOKED on a tv show!\\"  Then, I was channel surfing here and there, and caught a few bits and pieces of the 2nd season.  That was enough to get me a little curious and I went online to watch some season 1 episodes to understand the story better.  Well. If the first scene of the first show of the first season doesn't grab a person by the shirt collar, I don't know what will!  --Charming's flowing cape, his horse's thundering hooves, the dramatic landscape, the driving, suspenseful music:  you just KNOW a thrilling, epic story is in store -- and it is!!! :o)<br /><br />The writing, casting, costumes, sets and acting has all been so good.  --And the CONSISTENCY of the quality has been amazing -- so much so that I honestly don't know how they'll be able to maintain it - I hope they do, but seasons 1 and 2 were so good and so fun that if they AREN'T able to maintain the quality and creativity, what they've given us already has been enough to make me a Kitsis/Horowitz fan for life.  WOO HOO \\"Once Upon A Time\\"!!!  :o)<br /><br />[A word for fellow fans:  I write this after the latest episode, S2E18 \\"Selfless, Brave and True\\" has aired. WHAT'S going to happen with Belle and Gold?!?!? --SOOO romantic, but SO doomed!  I want it to work out so badly, but HOW is THAT possible?!?!]
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Such a great product! Sturdy case and is exactly as described. Great quality. I am buying a second one in a differently color to match my other purse!!! Totally recommend and I am picky!! I was worried it would look cheap but it does not at all!!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I enjoyed this read especially because it was FREE. Its nice to have inexpensive and free options when you are low on cash.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You just want to keep playing this game. Evenually, I'm going to beat that strange monkey-like beast. A fun run.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Compared to $100 bags, this is a good buy. I went from a one shoulder duffel type bag to the backpack. Its difficult to get accessories and cords all in and situated but for the money it is a good buy.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is a good product. I would recommend this to anyone. I would be interested in more purchase like this one.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Kind of odd.. you begin supporting one character and end supporting another. Begins kind of slow but leaves you scratching your head.
B00594XOZU|3.0|This is a good product. I would recommend this to anyone. I would be interested in more purchase like this one. Does use up your battery though
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I enjoyed this read especially because it was FREE. Its nice to have inexpensive and free options when you are low on cash.

B00BSW6F26|3.0|Pretty easy and a little short. Zero glitches on my fire so it was a fun hour or two. No &quot;hidden object&quot; scenes- a plus in my opinion!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This is a good product. I would recommend this to anyone. I would be interested in more purchase like this one.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Funny and well written.  Probably would have been even better if I had better background knowledge on Tina Fey before reading, but a good read nonetheless.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is a good product. I would recommend this to anyone. I would be interested in more purchase like this one.
1400069807|4.0|Should be required reading in school.  It addreesses one of the changes in our culture, caused by greed and ignorance.  The producers of these foods don't eat them, but create a class of citizens that do.  We would rise in revolution, but we're too sluggish to care.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This is a good product. I would recommend this to anyone. I would be interested in more purchase like this one.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I simply love this movie. Every time I watch it I see something new, some lovingly provided detail that makes me smile. I'd give it as many stars as they have.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|I really suggest this game for little kids my lil sister love this th game thank u doctor panda this is from all kids
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This is a pretty good game, I would like it better if it was like a quest with different places to go
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game the only reason that I gave it four stars is that you have to wait after completing a task that's annoying but overall I like this app.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Keep it in on my CD Changer in my car. Her best work and more. Every Whitney fan should have this.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A very neat way to connect with family and friends. I am connecting with people from coast to coast and over seas also. This fun way to do it. I thought I would never go on facebook, but it is fun.
1878424114|3.0|Just adiquit reading, not for everyone, and have to to be a focused reader. The author has an agenda, that dosen't meet everyone at the door.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is a practical to Personal Freedom. I keep it beside my bed every night so I can make sure I have kept at least one or more of the Agreements. The Wisdom in this book you will not find any where else. A must have have for any spiritual reading. To help you get threw your daily troubles.
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|I gave this movie 4 stars because nothing is perfect, Robert De Niro  and Joe Pesci are great together, one of the great movies of the era.
0525953728|4.0|This is a gripping read - I just don't want to put it down. Here's looking forward to more in this vein.
0446585041|5.0|Great read! I recommend it to anyone who is an Ellen fan or just want a light read for entertainment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not sure why I put off reading this book! There were a few times my jaw dropped open and I was just shocked! I will definitely be recommending it to my friends.
0316056863|5.0|Great read! I recommend it to anyone who is a Tina Fey or SNL fan or just want a light read for entertainment. For the most part it was funny but the one chapter regarding her experience with SNL kind of dragged....but still a great read.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I've had a &#34;bro-mance&#34; with this young singer since first hearing him at a Celine Deon concert who I have as a regular guy to gal crush(don't disparage, I'm a old man). It's his latest and although the writing is a little off his voice isn't. A must have for those who enjoy easy-listening music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show excels on so many levels.  It is creative, and well acted.  I'm looking forward to next season.  a
B0067R0APK|3.0|I just bought the Platinum version and was disapointed to find the &quot;improved&quot; version had thrown everything it had on the screen all at the same time, with no chance of removing or changing content.  I really enjoyed the original free version as it only showed current conditions and if I wanted more, all I had to do was use the pull down menu to access additional info.  Has that choice become too dificult for us to figure out?  Why has a simple weather app turned into what apears to be an internet home page?  Jim
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved every minute from beginning to end, So glad for a happy ending cause that's really what any of us want. Plus there was so much passion I actually cried with the characters I laughed I feel in love :) must read!!! Am anxiously waiting for Travis's POV to be open for sale it's after midnight ugh where is it ?!?!
B005U9REU0|5.0|I don't understand why its not a free rental any more?  Regardless, my kids love it and so do I.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I use Google search a lot every day. It freezes up half the time and I have to refresh the page. And this is going thru Google Chrome as well. And don't get me started on Google Chrome.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was very fun and kept me entertained for hours!! I cant wait to try more game's by Alawar! Try today!!!! You wont be disappointed!!! Graphics great sound is great has zoom feature....My ONLY complaint....it ended lol
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's hard to fault this series in any way.  The plot, writing and acting are all nearly flawless and the characters are as memorable as some of the other great PBS series.  Obviously Upstair Downstairs comes to mind.  Like those characters who are still in my mind these many years later, the Crawleys and the people who serve them are now a permanent part of my conscious.  I have watched almost every episode more than once and found new rich detail each time.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|There couldn't be a more perfect sequel to The Phantom of the Opera. Very sorrowful and beautiful!<br /><br />Arrived on time in great condition!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Amazing story and acting by the lead character, and who he is/was.  Very inspiring.<br />I thought it should've been NC-17 if that still exists.  (Very graphic and explicit sexual<br />scenes, so keep that in mind if you choose to watch this with someone who might not<br />be ok with that or might be too young for that or who struggles with staying away from<br />porn.)
B005MMY5RK|2.0|We didn't make it through 20 minutes of this and turned it off.  It is dated and wasn't interesting or entertaining to us.  Perhaps it was a good film in it's day.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very clear. Pictures are awesome to look at. This app blows IPhone version out of the water! Hasn't froze on me yet but it is slow to load sometimes.
B0076DELIG|5.0|A real thriller!  Connelly knows how to write all those twists and turns to keep you on edge, and yet make it so personal.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|Enough said. But I am required to have eighteen words, so here is seven more to fill this box out.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Excellent read. It had its moments that were slow or didn't quite make sense, BUT hang on this book is a fantastic ride through Russian history from different perspectives. Smith is a great character writer as well. This along with &#34;Agent 6&#34; is a couple of the bests books I have read in a few years.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I could barely put it down! Absolutely delightful. There was something for every-geek, no matter what your specialty or favorite - music, tech, games...this had it all. Took me back to a time in which we all thought virtual reality would be just like this. I can't begin to write a synopsis review like some of the others, but this was my favorite read in the past few months, and unless Cline writes more adventures for these folks really soon, I'll reread.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|not what I expected the only song I like is the one you hear Hold On other that than I was not impressed
B00881VLCE|4.0|I didn't have any issues with the game opening . I think it just needs more puzzles and possibly different jigsaw cuts?
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Love this album!! Loved their last one too, but this has more of that original \\"New Kid\\" sound and it makes me happy! Takes me back to my first concert in 1989 when I was 10yrs old!! You can also really hear all of their voices in the songs!Can't wait to see them singing these live in July! If you are a longtime fan you will NOT be disappointed!! :)
B0091REZMW|4.0|The hidden objects were a little too hard to find at first. My eyes did adjust so finding them now is possible. I would rather be able to move through the rooms somewhat more randomly than only having one or two open for search.
009950569X|5.0|Excellent ideas and concepts of how some are sticky and others are not.  Excellent reference book for managers or workers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you haven't read this book, you must be living under a rock!<br /><br />Great great great book.  Amazing story line and definitely captures your attention.  It's one of those &#34;I can't put it down until it's done&#34; books.<br /><br />Enjoy it!
1847940323|5.0|Whether a manager or worker... at home, with friends or family, change happens. Get to know how to deal with change.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you haven't read this book, you must be living under a rock!<br /><br />Great great great book.  Amazing story line and definitely captures your attention.  It's one of those &#34;I can't put it down until it's done&#34; books.<br /><br />Enjoy it!
B00271HAK8|4.0|Classic and funny movie that like many teenagers avoids reality at all expense and enjoys a wild ride along the way.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|i use my kindle daily it replaced my lap top , it goes everywhere with me  fits in my my purse , easy access to wi-fi
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Good story, just to much of the John Cory wit and sarcasm, way over done!<br />All in all I liked the book...
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love love love did I say love this game......This is the best game I can't put it down  great game
B004J4WNL2|4.0|So helpful and thorough.  I'm not as introverted as I thought- sometimes I must be running them over in conversation.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is simply amazing it's like you are sitting there having a conversation with Chris Kyle.  I'm truly not a big reader but was glued to this book from page one until the end.
B004XN3FHA|1.0|Turbo mode did not work from the beginning. Light was sent to Canada as per instructions. Light was sent from there to China. After 3 weeks and shipping cost of $24.00 I received my light same as before. No turbo mode and not a word as to why. After 2 calls to Canada with no results, I quit. This is my second FENIX light and my last.
0486219577|5.0|Wonderful book,It's all very well read and beautiful ,I can't wait to use it.It is so wonderful and arrived it very nice condition.
B007PKOKTK|3.0|Had a great time on Easter evening watching this movie with my wife and daughter. It's by no means a great movie, but it was entertaining for a holiday specific flick. My daughter is 3.5 so some of the humor was a little beyond her, but she laughed and enjoyed so that's all that matters.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I just finished fifty shades of grey and I'm going to have to start reading the second one because I haven't quite figured out what I think of it yet.  It is very different which makes it interesting.  Interesting enough that I read the whole book and I'm very picky, so......
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|A co-worker recommended that I try watching Castle so I got season 1.  I LOVE it and am completely hooked...I had to get the rest of the seasons right away so I could get all caught up.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|Not what many will expect, but it's a great coming-of-age story.  Great to see Emma Watson ditching her Hogwarts robes for classy fare like this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Followed the first book very well.  I stayed entertained throughout the series, and my child loved it too.  I liked how it was perfectly written and was age appropriate language for a pre teen
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is an amazing gift to those of us lucky enough to read it.  I am 80 years old, old enough to treasure the reality shared here.  Thank you Cheryl-no-longer-Starved.  You have fed me a banquet.<br />Sarah Allen
B0067AC5KA|5.0|So far what I have read has been great.  I love ebooks this way I don't have to go to store to purchase when I get done with 1, storage is easier, and the price is great
0385536828|2.0|First off, my husband enjoyed this book. There are some historical elements that kept his interest. For me, the female lead character is written badly. A man writing from a woman's perspective rarely ever works. This time it is downright offensive. Don't waste your time buying this in hardback or even paperback. I wouldn't bother to even read it on Kindle, but at least that would be easily disposed of!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read book before movie came out and enjoyed it.  I have to say after watching the movie, I like the book alot better.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not bad, but not awesome neither...<br />It is a closure, but left some open aspects.<br />In any case, I liked it.
B003J4MACU|5.0|Great old classic Clint, I dont get why they want 16 words when 4  or 5 will do makes me not want to review unless I get junk
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|The book is outstanding as a wade mecum made real in the behavior of the writers own quest to become a writer and to stay the craft, but also a great story too. It is thus both wade mecum and good literature, and, confirms by itself as example, King's admonition that &#34;story&#34; (read not plot) must be the principal guide to successful fiction writing.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Really well done and a fantastic story.  I highly recommend watching it -- you won't be sorry that you did.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Its a fun game for awhile, but it may get annoying or become less interesting, I haven't played much but I love horses and thought it would be a fun pass time game. There doesn't seem to be much to do but its seems to interest the younger kids, they seem to like it. Sooo, its good to keep the little ones occupied and me when I get bored :D
B0060I0IG2|5.0|This is an outstanding set.  I have listened to many recordings of these pieces over the years.  The conducting is very energetic.  The seventh symphony in particular is dynamic to the last note.  I really like how Chailly performs the fifith symphony,  If Beethoven were caught in the storm in the sixth.  He would have been thoroughly drenched and begging for  shelter.  Karajan in his 1962 set is the only competition for the top sets of the symphonies.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I would recommend this app! Especially if you have awesome tunes on your SoundCloud account. Granted it doesn't allow you to listen offline, it's easy to take your music with you where you have wifi. I love this app the most for my Kindle FireHD, too. Its awesome and if you have a recording app you can share with SoundCloud and the app also has its own recording like online. I just love this app sooooooooooo much!  :D I recommend!
B0000041Q3|4.0|This  is the classic recording of Turandot.  This has the best singers.  I had this on records and when my son wanted a recording of this opera, I got him this.  You ant go wrong with the orchestra and the conductor.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|If you love special effects and they are great you will love this movie.  I think there was one goup of monsters too many but it is based on the book so that's the way fantasies can be.  Not a dull moment for sure.
B00000G3I2|5.0|remember seeing this movie many,many years ago nice to have it on dvd.  one of those cult movies to add to your collection.
B005LAIII0|4.0|I expected more since the Oscars seemed to love it.  It had great special effects but seemed slightly slow at times but I guess you can only do so much sitting on a lifeboat through most of the movie.  I am not dissapointed I purchased it and will watch it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was my first Kindle download! It was a super easy and super quick process for the technically challenged. It downloaded within minutes.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This movie was great! Soundtrack was great! Awesome movie for this generation!! Addressed the struggles most kids deal with in high school. Love, love, love!
0307341577|4.0|I'm probably the only person who didn't love Gone Girl. That was actually the first Flynn novel that I read, and I actually liked it a lot up until the very end. The conclusion really fell flat for me, even though many said they found the ending to be incredible. I was hoping Dark Places would end a little better and I think it did... it kept me interested the whole way through. I'm pregnant right now and my piggy daughter typically needs a snack at 4 AM... I found myself reading Dark Places in the middle of the night while I ate my bowl of cereal, even though I was eager to get back to bed. It's a really good book and I found the ending much more satisfactory. I'm moving on to Sharp Objects next... working in reverse!! :)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I looked for a good long time for an alarm clock for the Kindle Fire.....this is the one. It has many options for the price. I like all the different clock faces, as well as the alarm settings.
B003K15IF8|5.0|Well written, accurate, relatable, sad.<br />The kind of book you highlight passages in to reread later.<br />Thought provoking highly recommended
B009AMANH4|5.0|Saw in theater; good to have at home for finer points of history and acting. Given as gift to family member.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Having the talents of so many good actors and such a large budget available, one would think a film on this subject would be an automatic winner. Not so. It is tedious, often boring and altogether entirely too confined. With so much material from which to choose, it focuses on the 13th amendment and almost nothing else. Tommy Lee Jones needs to slow down his speech so that he may be understood. Sally Field looked like Mary Todd Lincoln, but her script left a lot to be desired. My wife and I watched this together and both of us said we were waiting for it to get better. It never did. Save your money and wait for it to come out on cable. It won't be long.
0143120530|5.0|This is a very good book for a person like me in early 50's. For some reason the subject has come more actual.<br /><br />This is entertaining reading, not only techniques about remembering, but also information about human brains and science related brains and remembering.
B003FK8V7G|5.0|Upon my first listen to American Slang I was pretty underwhelmed. After becoming a fan with the masterful '59 Sound my expectations where soaring for this one. However, with every spin I began to find new melodies and lyrical twists that pulled me in. Before long I was listening to the record on a regular basis and enjoying it immensely. There's a swagger and laid-back feeling to American Slang that makes it a refreshing entry in the band's discography.<br /><br />Musically this is a Gaslight Anthem album through and through. Brian Fallon's trademark vocals and poetic lyrics are here in full force, with the usual tales about the trails of love, perseverance through tough times, self discovery, and nostalgia for the past. The rest of the band keeps everything moving, from the bouncing blues of \\"The Diamond Church Street Choir\\" to the punk overtones of \\"Orphans\\" and the 70s-inspried \\"The Queen of Lower Chelsea\\". The title track wastes no time in getting your feet tapping and underrated gems like \\"Boxer\\" and \\"The Spirit of Jazz\\" have received many repeated plays from me. \\"We Did It When We Were Young\\" closes the album in a beautiful and melancholy fashion.<br /><br />The diversity displayed and the classic American sound may throw a few listeners for a loop. Everything sounds relaxed and warm, taking its time to build up and keep you guessing. I didn't appreciate it at first but I was quickly won over as each track began to stick in my mind. The only gripe I really have is that the production is a bit muddy and doesn't sound as crisp as their previous work. It's not enough to significantly affect the album but it does cause the instruments to bleed together on some tracks and audiophiles like myself may struggle to hear all the wonderful elements tucked away into each track.<br /><br />The Gaslight Anthem is one of the best American bands on the scene and anyone wanting to get the full picture of this great group will want this in their collection. Highly recommended.
B005MW5CWW|5.0|I really underestimated Mastadon. They have a very unique, somewhat \\"Toolesque\\" sound. I'm hooked. This album is brilliant and has a very wide spectrum of sound. From traditional metal riffs to more ethereal prog rock. This is a must have.period!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Just a very well done depiction of a story that I'm proud was told.  Historical context was solid (from one who lived through this time).
0307476073|1.0|Definitely not John Muir's experience. I couldn't get through it. Didn't enjoy starting out with a tragic death scene or gratuitous heroin use. Even have my doubts whether she actually hiked the trail. Not much about the glories of the Sierra. A lot like Eat, Pray, Love.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Not going to give a detailed review with over 650 reviews already done but just to give my support to this brilliant film. I saw it quite randomly and was blown away. The animation is the best i've ever seen becuase of the detail, the script is excellent and the plot, classic but great.It's also genuinely funny and adventurous, not to mention above average in intelligent film making. Love all the homages to other movies, especially fear and loathing in las vegas.<br /><br />This is definitely no disney pixar style movie in terms of it's characters, dialogue and mature themes and consequently not for viewers below 8 or 9 in my opinion.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|I don't care who you are, if you give this movie a chance, you will enjoy it immensely.  It is as inspirational as a film can be.  Everyman makes good.  It brought me to tears in several places.  Excellent!
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Great movie, received it quickly and in perfect condition! Would recommend to anyone I know and my friends. Thanks  for the great movie.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I recommended this book to my book club. I enjoyed it. I liked both characters and their relationship dynamic. So get reading.
0880796863|3.0|The only thing I did not like, is that on every card there is a stamp of US Games, although in Italian card there is nothing except picture!
B000F8O35U|5.0|As a radio reporter, I had the opportunity to express these views to the film's director in person--so when I say that many Baby Boomers, when they first saw the ship emerge from the mists, they got the same genre-renaissance jolt that science fiction did when they first saw the rollup in \\"Star Wars.\\"  The delight continued through the film, which had the best original songs since \\"Dumbo\\" and ushered in a new style for Disney in which the songs weren't just animated, they moved the story forward Broadway-like in the manner of Rodgers and Hammerstein (hence the subsequent staged adaptations of this and other animated features.  IMO, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" remains the best, because those working on the project could not realize beforehand what they had accomplished, and so weren't overdoing their efforts to be entertaining (coincidentally, also like \\"Dumbo\\").  I can't recall another film that has garnered THREE Best Song nominations, and again IMO, \\"Part of Your World\\" should have won.  In any case, it rendered the end of the Ashman-Menken team a tragedy on a par with the end of Adler-Ross.  The only shame is that the studio brought Andersen's original ending--which in the final analysis IS a happy ending--crashing to earth, much the same as they did with \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\" segment in \\"Fantasia 2000.\\"  Which bring me to the real reason to beg, borrow, or steal this edition (especially if the bonus features are not retained on the re-release that reportedly is in the works for an upcoming 3-D theatrical release):  The inclusion of the studio's 2007 candidate for Best Animated Short, \\"The Little Match Girl,\\" a segment intended for the aborted \\"Fantasia 2006.\\"  As a third IMO, it is easily the most beautiful short Disney has ever made, not only because of the use of Borodin's \\"Nocturne,\\" but because the ending is not at all sugar-coated.  It's only the third time I can recall that Disney has allowed a \\"downer\\" ending--the other two are \\"Education for Death\\" and \\"Chicken Little\\" (both 1943).  It's too bad Disney has an overwhelmingly self-conscious \\"we can do no wrong and never have\\" mindset, unlike, say Warner Brothers, which has put only censored versions of \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"Fantasia\\" on home video and has denied us entirely a disc of \\"Song of the South\\" (although it freely uses its Oscar- winning \\"Zip-a-dee-doo-dah\\").  The studio is still unwilling to admit to a butchered version of \\"Peter Pan\\" that is inferior to all other stage and film treatments.
B005K17RU0|1.0|New interface is plain.  Access to maps and other functions are limited and its hard to find what you are looking for.  on the kindle fire v1,  the page is split into 3 or 4 pieces that don't fit. plainly put, the latest release is like looking at your Yahoo home page before you log in,  white,  ugly,  and useless. I'm sure the info that I want is hidden in there someplace but on the old version I clicked on the radar and boom I could see a map with weather radar.  I will be uninstalling and trying something different.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|Good series but not as intense as movies like \\"28 Days Later\\" or \\"30 Days Of Night\\".<br />Both the plot and zombies in \\"Walking Dead\\" are slow paced. ...The zombies in 28 Days<br />and vampires in 30 Days are HI-SPEED. As in Terrifying !!!<br /><br />I enjoy watching the \\"Walking Dead\\". It's one of the better series on TV. But if you watch<br />28 Days or 30 Days and follow it up with The Walking Dead, you will find the The Dead<br />painfully slow.
1936891026|5.0|As a painter, I've struggled with my confidence as an artist all my life. This book is not an instant cure. What it does is identify the enemy of creativity and productivity and it sets the reader in the frame of mind that allows them to over come their barriers.<br /><br />I fight my fears one day at a time and most days I have been winning. I am a lot better off after reading this book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show is about space cowboys.  Yes...space cowboys.  Sounds incredibly dumb, but this show manages to pull it off with characters that latch on to your heart and storylines that haunt you.  You will be hooked.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Our daughter in law got us started on this series and we became hooked immediately.  Since we started late we had several missed episodes to bring us up to date.  No problem, Amazon had them and we are catching up using our Roku on one TV and Sony's Bravia on the other.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|The idea of the game is fun but the programming is mediocre. The sensitivity of the controls completely ruins the game. Why can it not be like the games that automatically turn off screen rotation! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I have always wanted to have this album in CD format.<br />I love the music of Pink Floyd. It is a classic album
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Bob<br /><br />Minecraft to a report from this point I am looking to build up your computer is not responsible to the rescue and other words to build the movie and I think it would take to a new one that has the hobbits the rescue plan is to the movie was in fact it was the hobbits to be able the rescue of this year ago I was a great job on this site are a report by an individual to build a great way of life for a new study suggests a report on form.
159562015X|5.0|We have been using this book to find the strengths of our new associates.  Then we create a framed display of the 5-strengths, which helps us all work on using/focusing on ones strenghts.  It is a Win-Win for our department!  Other departments in our company are also starting to do the same practice.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is. awesome. everyone should have it!!!! love. ya. u should totally awesome app apple. adding. cars<br /><br />I love this. it is a five star game in my eyes. I would wish to thank. the creater!!!!<br /><br />plus me great. cheese!!!!!
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Very funny and very relatable, but got a little long... and slightly too real making it just a little bit stressful to watch. All in all, many laugh out loud moments and a good movie.
0345529057|1.0|As many of the reviews on this product state, there are many printing errors (such as missing and miscut pages). I tried contacting the publisher for a replacement but they gave me the run-around. UInless it is a book i REALLY want to read, I will steer clear of this publisher (Bantam) in the future.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|This product worked as well as I had expected. Looking for good polaroid film is not an easy feat, especially since polaroid stopped making film in 2008. I read a lot of reviews on different products, and despite many reviews for the impossible being negative because of development time, which is true, I decided to go ahead and take the plunge. The pricing is obviously on the high side, but relatively speaking, compared to polaroid brand film, impossible is a lot cheaper.  Also, almost every review for the polaroid brand film is negative because of either, expired film, pictures coming out dark or defected, or pictures just not coming out at all.  The pictures from the impossible film came out very well and there were no defects or other problems. I just got mine in the mail yesterday and I already put in an order for more today! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and everyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Bought for my teen son who hates to read. He loves it. Need I say more??? ? ? ? ??
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I give this amazing book 5stars I like every thing about it if you like mythology Rick Riordan is your guy LOVE the book!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|My teen son, who hates to read, loves this author and he asked me for these books. He can read a whole book in a few days!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I am a firm believer in true love. Though this book left me wishing the ending was different, I really appreciated that love wasn't represented as a sprint but as a steady marathon.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|Kind of cute. A little addicting. Takes a bit to get use to. Not a learning experience which I was hoping it would be but I still play it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I think this app is pretty great. its just like youtube only its on ur mobile device not ur computer. also it doesn't freeze or anything! get this app I love it!!!! and its free!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Bought the whole hero's set for my teen son. He hates reading but loves this author. Need I say more?
B000066C6F|4.0|Was recommended by a friend. I had very low expectations and was surprised the movie actually had a plot. Shazam
B0044RFT8S|5.0|Combo comes with good extras and movie itself is quite entertaining. It's nice to have in your collection for those days you need to laugh and relax.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I recommend this movie if you're into a lot of actions and short dialogue. I enjoyed watching it with my boyfriend.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great story line, fun puzzles &amp; hidden objects. You can play in a relaxed mode.  No pressure from a ticking clock. Graphics are assume. This is my 3rd time playing the fame and I will most likely play again. THANKS  WHERE IS NUMBERV2????
0743201140|4.0|This book was used for a work class - everyone was happy with it. We got the book quickly and they were able to jump right into it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|better than the first two but still not much of a story line - no plot to speak of - can't believe what all the hoopla was about with these books
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Honestly, this game is a feeble attempt to replicate the former majesty of the temple run saga. Honestly, if it didn't have the name temple run in the title, I would have thought that it was a cheap imitation of temple run. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|It was well written and very informative. Thanks to science our world and universe is better and better understood.<br />Hopefully it will soon be able to remove the scourge of the superstition called religion, which has been the cause of so much suffering, hatred, violence, ignorance and hypocrisy on our planet and the cause of so many wars.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Good action and consistent with my expectations from the previous MI movies.  Acting was good, but this is a movie about entertaining action, so it accomplished it's goal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The thing that gets me about The Walking Dead is that I care about the people in the story.  Great character development and in season 3 you see that evil humans are way scarier than any &#34;walking dead.&#34;  I find myself gasping, yelling, and screaming at the characters throughout many of the episodes and yes, even crying a bit.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is another exciting and fun game from G5.It definitely keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. I do think it would be nice if they were priced not quite so much.Maybe they could have a game club.I still enjoyed the game and would recommend it to others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I seriously enjoy this show. From week to week, it has been exciting and I'm involved with it in a way I haven't been with a show for years.
B0018QXL1K|5.0|Classic! Epic!  Recommend this to everyone who loves music.  Wish they put out unreleased or bonus songs from this CD.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book reminded me of when my cousin passed and came to me two nights after. I asked him why he had left us?  He describe this beautiful place and didn't want to leave it. He knew he would see us again. I truly believe him.
158270208X|5.0|I really enjoy the book because its a reminder that we all need to be grateful for something, and remember someone else always has things worse off than us. Its a good book to have and will purchase more as gifts.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So I must give it a good rating. If she happy playing it must be pretty good, she doesn't play many things.
1582701709|5.0|I thought this book was very interesting and thought provoking. I'd like to buy more and give them away as gifts.
0307887448|5.0|The booked arrived quickly and in great shape. The book is amazing.  AMAZING.  I also recommend the audio book read by Will Wheaton.
0307165485|5.0|I grew up with Richard Scarry and now that I have kids of my own, it's great to find his works still on offer.<br /><br />What's to say about this volume? It's a fabulous hardcover with great illustrations, and the kids haven't stopped browsing through it since it arrived. Perfect.<br /><br />Favorites: the alligator car, the shark car, and the page on which several characters are having a picnic on the beach.<br /><br />If you don't know Richard Scarry, get this for your toddlers. They'll absolutely LOVE it. The amount of detail is unmatched, and Richard Scarry's talent for creating simple, yet engaging new concepts from juxtapositions of ideas that small children have already mastered is on full display.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Film was amazing!  Not what I expected but none the less worthwhile. Would highly recommend to anyone. Good to watch with family.
0143106651|5.0|Little Women is a classic for a reason - it's a great story about the March girls and how they grow into adulthood. My favorite character was Jo, she was so funny and theatrical. I would definitely recommend this book to others.<br />The Penguin Threads edition has a beautiful raised design and the page edges are purposely ragged which I love. I was very happy with this purchase.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I've been doing this workout video/DVD on and off for over 20 years. I'm typically very sore after completing it for the first time in months but I quickly get back into it. Nothing has given me results like this video. I know the moves so well that it almost feels like yoga to me. I feel energized and accomplished after completing the video and wonder why I ever stopped doing it but with kids, work etc.. life just gets in the way. My young daughters enjoy exercising with me and sometimes put it on this DVD by themselves and enjoy jumping around the room with Cindy.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|solid gameplay<br />sometimes a bit laggy but not sonbad as to make the game unplayable.  looking forward to seeing more hero's and content.  thisis a great game
B00275EHJG|4.0|This third movie of the Toy Story series does not disappoint.  This is a wonderful story for the whole family:)
B004J64QSI|5.0|I chose this rating because it is the best musical I've seen so far in my life. the screen film was a lovely rendering of this performance on stage, it is all connected and worth the money.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Went looking for my Adele CD, and it had mysteriously &#34;disappeared&#34; (perhaps into my partner's CD player in his car), so bought a second copy to play around the house. Love, love, love Adele! What a talented and soulful young woman she is.
0783211856|5.0|this movie best exemplifies the struggles and open torture of the times. I am moved each time I watch it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show gets better each season. Full of suspense, action, and drama. Most episodes are engaging from start to finish
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|the cast makes the movie...stars I know and new ones that I have come to love in this film. I will be watching this for years to come...I just bought it and have seen it nearly eight times!
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I understand it is the same author and elements would be the same, but some of the scenes seem to be shot for shot recreates of the LotR series.  And where LotR was &#34;gritty&#34; this was just campy.  No reason to be two 3-hour movies.  Almost every other book-to-movie adaptation is edited down, now I know why; there is no need to have a 10-minute dish cleaning sing-song.
B005STGJEO|5.0|Just a simply fantastic album.  If you like good music, blues, rock, soul - this has it. My first Black Keys album and I am truly impressed by their ability to deliver classic blues with their own twist. Can only emphasize that this is a must own. Every track is so well done... I can only hope that they do another album of cover tracks like this one.
B00821OX98|5.0|I thought this was a great sci-fi action show for the family. We like to find television series that we can watch and enjoy as a family and the kids couldn't wait for the &#34;skidders&#34; to come out! It follows a great storyline of a father doing everything he can to keep him and his boys together and to get one of his boys back from the aliens that have invaded Earth. These &#34;skidders&#34; somehow harness the human kids and make them into slaves of some sort. Definitely a twist compared to the traditional alien vs. human themes.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|I watch this movie it wasn't that great it got boring sometimes plus i didn't like animal being kill it was very disturbing specifically when the tiger was struggling in the water THIS MOVIE IS NOT AVATOR<br /><br />BUYER BEWARD DON'T NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH THE KIDS THEY WILL GET NIGHTMARE THERE ARE CREEPY CREATURE IN THE MOVIE
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Just an over all adorable movie. I don't expect much from disney movies these days. But this one had a great soundtrack and a lots of laughs
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|We initially rented it from Amazon and was watching it through our blu ray player.  But we kept having connection problems.  It kept stopping to buffer.  So, I got my husband to run to Walmart and buy the blu ray so we could watch it uninterrupted.  We absolutely loved the movie and are eagerly waiting for the other 2 movies to be released.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Great end to a great series. Leaves questions though hopefully more books to come. I couldn't read it fast enough.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Love this whole series. I would have reviewed this sooner but I've been too busy watching it again and again:)
B00AFEY354|5.0|I wasn't sure weather this movie would be a boring dramatic movie, but it wasn't, it was a great movie. The acting was great, this is a film that should had gotten an Oscar, this is what a great movie is, but of course the Oscar's believe that nothing that is rated PG-13 or have teens is really Oscar worthy. The story follows Charlie, a freshmen, who all he wants in the world is to have friends, people he can talk to, Charlie has a past, but we really don't get to see it, we only get very few flashbacks. At a football game, Charlie decides to sit next to a boy, Peter, who is in his wood shop class ( he's a senior, who has to take wood shop over with freshmen's) Charlie also meets Sam, Peter's step sister, who is also a senior and whom later on in the storyline starts having feelings for. This story is amazing, about friendship, dating, etc. This movie isn't your average teenage drama.
0345525558|5.0|As a clinical social worker, I found this very profound story to be an accurate and sensitive portrayal of a young woman betrayed by our system of caring for at risk children.  The author also portrayed the salvific value of flowers and language.
B004LWZW42|3.0|I did like this film, but the beginning dragged, I was confused for the first half of the movie about what was going on, like in the flashbacks, in the beginning, which was Charles, and which was Erick. Of course you do find out later on, but I don't like to be confused about which character is which. I also didn't like that a 3rd of this movie was subtitles. I hate watching movies where I have to read to understand what's going on. Sometimes the acting was bad, and when one of the members gets killed, the only thing they do is have a line saying \\"he just died\\" and have watery eyes for a few seconds and move on. Most of the scenes in the beginning moved to fast, looking like if it was trying to be forced in, not sure if I explained it right, but I think what happens at the end and the fight at the end makes up for that. I also thought that Jennifer Lawrence had a lot of cheesy lines in this movie, her character was predictable. I would had also had liked to seen more battle scenes between the main villain and our heros, instead of a battle almost at the end, and most of the effects looked really fake. But I will be seeing the second movie, which sadly won't be released till 2014, due to Lawrence's schedule and because they wanted to revise the script.<br /><br />Plot<br />In 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power when his mother is sent to a concentration camp. The evil Dr. Sebastian Shaw brings Erik to his office and kills his mother, increasing his abilities through anger. In New York, the wealthy Charles Xavier meets the mutant Raven and invites her to live in his manor. In 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert discovers the existence of mutants working with Shaw and the invites Professor Xavier to recruit mutants to work for the USA government. Xavier teams up with Raven, Erik and a group of young mutants. Sooner they learn that the evil Shaw has the intention of beginning a nuclear war to destroy the world and increase his power.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Like all the other story games with the exception that it's even slower!! Everything takes hours, so it's a huge conspiracy to buy gold if you want to play more than a couple times a day.
B008J34466|5.0|one of pinks biggest fans,i absolutely am blown away,once again by her amazing voice and lyrics.ive been telling evryone to buy this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is the best you can do everything we can do but in a block world and when we die we respawn
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|You've heard about it, now SEE it. Fantastic imagery and storyline of a young man shipwrecked on a lifeboat with a tiger. Fantastically imagined and superbly produced. Amazing performances by the main character played by Suraj Sharma. The imagery is key to this film with staggeringly beautiful sights you can't even imagine presented magnificently. Prepare to be moved and amazed.
B003H8WSM0|5.0|The greatest band out right now.  This is a masterpiece.  Great guitar album. Go see them live when they come to your town you will not be disappointed.
B00782O7NE|5.0|A charming film that seems to recapture the silent film era beautifully. Jean Dujardin is easy on the eyes and so is the costar, Bérénice Bejo.
0345455681|3.0|I thought this book could have been amazing but it wasn't. Too much detail on some things and not enough on others. No one character that I liked and wanted to do well, I just thought it seemed flat and boring. Wish I could have liked it.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|Fast paced with a steady pace and lots of action.  The plot is somewhat predictable but its still a fun movie.  Enjoy
B0099XX46Q|5.0|This is a good movie and it arrived exactly when it was required to arrive!<br />I think it is a bit scary for kids under 12 years old.
1401307957|5.0|This book is geared toward writing and it was referred to me.  I enjoy writing and love new ways to get a page out or two.  The book arrived as scheduled and as it appeared on line.
0525953728|5.0|Uncensored opinions re: BinLadin  and the mind-set of the people involved in this hunt.<br />Reccomend this book and the other books and dvd related to this case.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|In the light of what is going on in the catholic church this was an eye-opener to me!  A storey about a simple man!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love all of this series ...one of the most exciting series they have one tv I getting the season 8 next week
B005XZHQKY|4.0|Don't like the 3D at my beamer, but 2D is perfect. It's like swimming together, so real...... We do live in a beautifull world
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Wonderful..well written...I enjoyed reading this book..open of those books that you hate to see end....Very interesting characters to cheer for
B007STBUIW|5.0|Thought I would be disappointed because it's an old movie. But it's great. My wife almost sreamed louder than the girl that was eten by jaws. On my beamer, big screen and the home cinema very loud..... My neighboors who<br />Iive 150 yards away phoned us if we where ok. Heard a lot of screaming LOL
0307352153|4.0|This was a good book covering Introverts, Extroverts, and a little on other personality traits.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Introverts.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|great product good lighting does the job compact enough to carry around in a back pack durable enough to get hits and not be affected, love the effectiveness
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I enjoy the character development, the story-line, the scenery ... everything you need for a good show is right here.
0767817478|5.0|I ordered this movie for my daughter.  She loves all the Sci-Fi Movies, especially the ones with giant lizards and large creatures.  We watched it right away and yes it was awesome.  She was completely happy.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Martin has created an unpleasant new world, where all fight for the top. He unexpectedly kills off characters that you have grown to like and support, due to his dedication to moving the story forward. His characters are brilliant depictions of people chasing power, mingled with people who are simply caught in crossfires of conflict. He also mixes in the magical and the spiritual in the complex web of events, passions, betrayals, and unexpected nobiilty.<br /><br />This is a series well worth the time it takes to sort through its complexities.
0375851569|5.0|New in box. Absolutely beautiful packaging & exactly what I wanted. The 2 year old I bought it for is absolutely in love with it. BEST gift!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The writers have made the characters much more complex in this season.  Season 2 ends with Rick saying the group is not a democracy.  That certainly changes in Season 3.  We also meet &#34;The Governor&#34; who is a perfect arch enemy for Rick and helps to define who Rick really is as he wavers on the fence between good an evil.  Probably one of the best seasons so far in terms of character development.  Some of the be &#34;shocking&#34; moments were somewhat predictable, but still grabbed you nonetheless.  The season finale was a roller coaster of emotion which had me on the edge of my seat screaming at the TV at one point, sad at another, and smiling warmly at yet another point.  Two thumbs up, this show keeps getting better.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Not anywhere near as good as the prior Bourne movies and has nothing to do with Jeremy as he was quite good in this endevour.  Was a good watch, not great.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Let me start by saying this is FAR from the type of music I normally listen to. Seriously, check my other reviews, its pretty much all hip-hop. But I know a girl who loves this album, so I heard it all the time hanging out with her, and I gotta say, it really grew on me. I can't stand sappy, pop-music, but Lana's words are just so emotional, and in such a uniquely dark and sometimes kind of depressing way - I just love it! Her voice is super sexy, too! You can almost feel her breath on your ear. And best of all, it's so relatable! Whether you're crazy in love, or just had your heart broken, there's songs here that will really hit home. As a heterosexual male, I sort of hate that I love this album so much, but I can't help it!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I brought my Kindle second hand and noticed that the cord was cut.  This cord works great and at a cheap price.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very much like dragon city on fb.  I like playing it and my son will enjoy it, too.  So far not asking me for any money.
B008220DGE|3.0|The Master was a good movie but a little difficult to watch at times. Phoenix was good as the tortured soul.  Amy Adams was especially good as the wife. Hoffman was great as usual. When it was over something felt unresolved, which I'm sure was the point. Cult mentality is freaky. It nailed the weirdness of it all.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I got this album for the song Some Nights, I listened to the whole cd completely entranced by Nates vocal talents and the touching lyrics. I think my favorite time to listen to it is on a chilly night in company of my hubster.  It was definitely worth purchasing the entire album, I keep the disc in my car and have the album uploaded to my kindle & iPhone. Nate's voice is within a mere swipe of my finger at any given time.
0937381888|4.0|Pretty much a must have for home brewers of any level. Covers basics to advanced, and really spells out the science if you want it.<br /><br />One star off for having a next to useless index.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|She has such a sweet voice. She also put a new sound and style to some of the songs. It makes me happy.
159562015X|3.0|A co-worker recommended this assessment to me.  It was interesting, gave immediate results, and allows for follow up if needed.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game is just great, it is a great way to pass time and to kind of learn a bit of management skills
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|The DVD was perfect. I love this movie. Reminds me of the time I saw it as a little girl and I wanted my granddaughter to watch it as well.
1568363931|5.0|There are great pictures and easy to follow recipes.  Most are using everyday ingrediants and there is a nice glossary in the back.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I love this movie. It gives me great joy to watch it. I will watch it over and over again.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I like the ease of this app. I can set up a notebook for every single thing in one place, and I like the way the bookshelf looks. It would be better if I had a keyboard on my Kindle, but it's still very do-able. I have tried several notebook apps, and this is the one I always go back to.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|There are many other games similar enough to this one to not pay anything for an app that messes up on almost every game played
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is another game I downloaded for my grandkids, and guess who plays it! lol It's a cute game, very well put together. I love the graphics, and enjoy watching, even when I'm not the one playing.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Terrible Rip off. Bought items and now cannot open game. I want my money Back  . Install ed game twice and lost money Twice
B00BF11STU|3.0|Not very impressed.....seemed like I was just watching the news with a bit more in depth reporting. Just glad I didn't pay full price to see this in the theater
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I think this is the best set for Star Wars that has been released yet and it was amazing to see the quality on the disks but the artwork on the cover and in the packaging (and on the disks for that matter) are terrible. They look like badly painted fan works. Really could have set this set to 5 stars if the presentation was a bit better. After getting the complete Aliens movie set (which uses the same style book for the disks) I can really see where they went wrong on it. Only thing that kept this from 5 stars for me. Oh well maybe with the next set of movies coming out there will be an upgrade in a few years.
B0013527I4|5.0|I've been waiting for this volume to come out. Some of my favorite episodes of the muppet show I havent seen in a long time are on this volume and I was so happy to see them restored and uncut on DVD!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is a perfect set. Nothing I would have changed and probably the best packaging and artwork I have ever seen on a set.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|These girls always deliver when it comes to singing beautiful songs in their own beautiful way. Some songs I heard before elsewhere; their renditions of them made me love the songs all over again. Meanwhile, they sang songs I never heard before and now those songs are among my favorites to date! This DVD is worth getting if you are a Celtic Woman fan or even if you are just a fan of good music!
B005LAII80|5.0|One of the best movies of 2012! Everyone I have shown it to has been surprised and loved it! Must have!
B006JTS5OO|5.0|This movie met my expectations as a Muppet fan when I saw it in the theatre. When I got the Blu-Ray, the bonus features in there were an even bigger delight. Bloopers, deleted scenes and other fun stuff in various Muppets makes it hard to get tired of too quickly :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I wasn't sure at first if I'd like Homeland Season 1, but after the second episode, I got hooked. The characters are well developed, the plot is smart, sophisticated, and has lots of twists. I can't wait to watch Season 2!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks novel I have read, but it was hard to put down.  I become totally engrossed with the characters and was completely surprised with the ending.  I always love a good twist at the end of a book.  I am definitely going to be checking out more books by Nicholas Sparks now as well!!  It's a quick read and you won't want to quit until you're done!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great break from the traditional, brain-numbing, what-am-I-really-doing-with-my-time brand of entertainment, Downton Abbey has something to offer from a more contemplative viewpoint.
030746363X|5.0|Of course you cannot do everything that is in this book but it does make you start to think outside the box like his other book does...that's why I like his books, just do what you feel called to do...now when taking a shower I turn on the cold water at the end and it makes me feel great, what might be good for one might not be good for the next so keep that in mind and if your spirit leads you to do something in the book then do it but don't read the book thinking you have to do all it says, it is so big that you might have to read it more than once because there is a lot of information in it.
B0094K20FK|4.0|This sequel to the original Star Trek movie is a classic. I was blown away the first time I saw this film. If I happen to be channel surfing and this gem happens to be on, I always lock phasers right on this masterpiece.

0316223239|5.0|Donoghue's prose has that unique seamless quality that draws you into her story and refuses to let go. The story is told from the perspective of five-year-old Jack who was born to his captive/kidnapped mother and is subsequently kept imprisoned in Room till \\"Ma\\" engineers their daring escape. Jack's a precocious child in many ways and, albeit second-hand, the reader is made to marvel at the heroic effort his Ma has made to keep him safe and sane given the circumstances. What some other reviewers have pointed out as inconsistencies and the use of annoying language adopted by a five-year-old narrator, to me only lend more to the unique flavour of this book. I frequently found myself marvelling at how well Donoghue has written Jack, he's completely 3 dimensional and throughly readable. This story managed to raise goosebumps, and made me laugh and cry, all in equal measure. A very fast read and thoroughly, harrowingly, enjoyable. Five stars, indeed!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|She is one of the artist's that I listen to the most, I buy all her CD's and this one I keep in my car and listen to it over and over again, it gets me in a good mood, especially on long trips...they would not be the same without putting her in, very pleased.
1610390938|1.0|And earlier copy was also missing pages, so I returned it and got this, which is missing pages as well. It's actually an excellent book in terms of content, but it's a crappy physical instantiation. How do they not check whether a book has all its pages?
1439102813|5.0|I've been wanting to read this book for years, and when I saw it in Barnes and Noble, I knew I had to have it.<br /><br />Still Alice tells the story of Alice Howland, a Harvard professor of psychology who is well-known for her research, intellect, and prestige in her field. She's in the best physical shape of her life at the age of fifty-one with three grown children and a loving husband who shares her passion for his work. But when she starts to experience lapses in memory and gets lost in the town she's taught in for twenty-five years, she takes a trip to the neurologist.<br /><br />She is diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.<br /><br />This novel follows Alice's mental decline through the course of a year or so. The way Genova writes this novel forces the reader to put on Alice's shoes and share in the fear, despair, and confusion that comes with losing the essence of who you are: your memories.<br /><br />I am not ashamed to admit that I was bawling my eyes out while reading this. Just knowing that there are people out in the world that experience this disease fills me with a sense of sadness. But hopefully some day, there will be a cure for this disease, and people like Alice will never have to live long after they have died.<br /><br />I recommend that everyone reads this book. It teaches so much about love and the bonds of family...how they can be the only thing that can survive when Alzheimer's threatens to destroy who you are. I will definitely be reading Genova's other books, despite the inherent knowledge that I will cry.
B00B4W8AIW|4.0|If you're a *true* metal connoisseur; if you've got a keen ear for musical technicality and proficiency, then you have no doubt that technically, this is KsE's best album to date. With that said, AOJB is still my favorite KsE album of all time, and my favorite metalcore album (as it essentially defined the genre) to date. Boy oh boy am I glad Jesse is back! You can hear it in the music and the vocals! Don't get me wrong, Howard Jones was a great vocalist and they had a *few* great songs with him; however, anyone that thinks he is a better fit for what KsE represents is in denial. If you're a fan of KsE, and a true fan of metal, this album *WILL NOT* disappoint. However, if you're a Howard Jones fan boy, and you think their most recent self-titled release is a good album, then you may want to skip this and go pick up a Fall Out Boy album. That's right, I just referenced Fall out Boy.

0375830995|3.0|Ed Kennedy, nineteen years old, lives on his own with his elderly malodorous dog, the Doorman.  He drives a taxi despite being underage and spends most of his time knocking about, playing cards mostly, with his three best friends.  Audrey, also a cab driver, is the object of Ed's affection but she's relegated him to the \\"friend zone\\".  They clearly love each other, but that's not what Audrey's looking for in her romances.  She's been hurt before and is unwilling to truly open herself up to a lover.  Friendship is safer - even if it's torture for Ed.  Marvin has a crap car about which he's extremely touchy.  He's a carpenter who works with his father.  Despite making pretty good money, he's cheap.  For reasons unknown, he keeps a death-grip on his pennies (or the Australian equivalent).  Ritchie's quiet and doesn't work.  None of the four have any real ambition or sense of purpose.  They're stuck in a rut, just aimlessly following their dead end paths.<br /><br />\\"I am the Messenger\\" opens with the hapless quartet victims of a bank robbery.  Without behaving particularly heroically, Ed ends up foiling the robbery and catching the perpetrator.  Soon thereafter, he receives a strange envelope in the mail.  Inside is an ace of diamonds with three handwritten addresses and times.  Unsure what to make of the mysterious correspondence, Ed finally visits the addresses at the appointed times.  He senses that he's been given a quest, a task he must perform for each of the listings.  The tasks aren't necessarily comfortable and may even carry some risk, but he feels they have to be done.  But will it end there?  There are three more aces in the deck, after all.  Who's manipulating Ed in this way?  And why?  What's the point of it all?<br /><br />There's a touch of magical realism as Ed undertakes his quest.  How does he figure out what's required of him in each instance?  Somehow he just knows.  But then, how does the individual behind the cards act as a puppeteer exerting unbridled influence over so many details?  The reader just accepts these things.  Ed's actions, whether small or dramatic, positively impact those to whom he's sent.  The listless protagonist ends up making a difference in people's lives which, in turn, transforms him.  This is the inspirational bearing of the story.  Each of the tasks Ed undertakes is a touching example of the transformation that's possible in people's lives - often accomplishable by the simplest gestures.  Equally important, you don't have to be a hero or someone special to make a difference.  The message is slightly hindered because some of the scenarios were a little arbitrary if not actually disingenuous.  Artistic license is definitely taken in the results of some of the actions and also in people's reactions.  Regardless, the message is certainly an honorable and worthy one.  For many, it's probably relatively obvious and the book won't really inspire them to new heights.  But for anyone who feels trapped and powerless or who's never really considered how he can help those around him or that he's capable of change, it's a potent and moving testimony.<br /><br />And then there's the ending...  So who's responsible for the cards?  In an extremely clever and surprising finale, author Markus Zusak identifies the culprit in a metafictional flourish.  In some way, it's the only ending that works.  It answers all the concerns or questions about what's gone before.  At the same time, however, it sadly cheapens it.  This is the greatest failure of the novel.  The reader takes great interest in the protagonist's journey and in the transformations wrought and he yearns to have the mystery resolved in a way that affirms what he's experienced and read.  The ending chosen, despite its relative brilliance, does the exact opposite.  While no other ending could have fit so well, it reveals a fatal flaw existed from the beginning.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Wow!!! This is not the type of book I would generally read. A murder/courtroom/legal thriller. You become engaged with the narrator, whose reliability or unreliability is a puzzle to piece together! This is a dark story of a community and family that become unhinged by a violent crime. The characters, and the twists and turns had me on edge. Jacob, is the fourteen-year-old son of District Attorney Andy Barber. Jacob is accused of murdering his classmate. I could not put this book down! Great writing! If you like suspense, than this book is for you!

B007K3JFUQ|2.0|There are 2 versions of this movie--one with a few extras and one without any. I had wanted the one with but didn't notice that the one I chose was the other so I'll have to sell my copy and then get the other.<br /><br />The movie itself was about on the same level as the first. My ex-husband is a Holmes fanatic and he hated it because it (as well as the first movie) strayed very far from the original stories in both content and the appearances of the settings and actors, but I enjoyed them both.<br /><br />The extras on the second movie are few so if there's a third I would suggest having more extras.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was told about this show after the 3rd season had just ended. So when I caught up I was so happy to see that I could just download it on Amazon. Great show.

While it does not have a closure on it (like maybe velcro to keep it closed), it is protective and handy.  The only thing I would add is some sort of hasp, closure, or velcro to keep it shut.  The cover will 'flop'.

NOT the lack of performance on her part.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I was expecting a funny movie and this movie is really pretty serious with a few amusing moments. It is still worth watching as I love the actors in it.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I have seen the DVD of this concert literally hundreds of times now, and for one simple reason -- it has become my two-year-old son's favorite. Little did I know that my plan to start playing a bunch of different music DVDs for him would never get past this disc, which was the first one I put in. From the minute I pointed to the drummer in the opening riff of \\"The Obvious Child\\", the first song on the DVD, and said \\"Look, drums!\\", my fate was sealed. I don't know if I will ever be able to watch anything else on TV, this is all the boy wants to see.<br /><br />And the interesting thing is, I don't mind. I like Paul Simon a lot, and I've seen a lot of the concert DVDs, including the two Simon and Garfunkel reunion shows in Central Park and Madison Square Garden. This is very different and in my view it's one of the best concert recordings I've ever seen. Paul Simon looks a lot older, but he sounds better than ever.<br /><br />The musicianship is outstanding. Everyone is a multi-instrumentalist, and there is real inventiveness here. I was particularly impressed that the grand piano at stage right was transformed into prepared piano for \\"Rewrite\\" to emulate the sound of the kora on the original recording. Or the piano player playing the inside strings of the piano like a cimbalom. Or the saxophonist/flutist/glockenspiel player in the back. Or the accordion/keyboard/trumpet guy. Or the drummer/slide guitar player.<br /><br />Old hit songs are transformed into new creations while staying true to the original spirit. There are layers upon layers of arranging and playing to really sit back and enjoy. And the tracks from his most recent studio album are among the best in the show, showing a combination of rhythmic complexity and tunes that you just can't shake out of your head.<br /><br />Paul Simon still has it, both as a writer and performer. And I still don't mind fulfilling my son's constant requests. \\"Drums!\\", he shouts, and starts playing air drums with the opening bars. I join him, settling in for a rerun of one of the best shows I've seen.s. I join him, settling in for a rerun of one of the best shows I've seen.

B00124DSR0|5.0|Most people around the age of 30 only know Chicago from the Peter Cetera-lead love songs and power ballads era that they went through but this album is full of good, tight playing from musicians who knew what sound they wanted. The whole album showcases the musicianship that was in this band and one of my personal beliefs is that a good horn section makes every band 27.3% better. If you like a little funk or a little prog rock (the lines between the two genres are generally blurred with these guys) then you will enjoy this album greatly.

0385349947|4.0|I preface what I'm about to say with this: 1) I'm a paralegal and was a single mother for several years.  Despite the online ads you see from unaccredited diploma mills, the paralegal profession doesn't pay enough to hire a nanny.  2) My profession also falls neatly in line with the most common job for women in 2013: secretary.  Why women continue to dominate this profession deserves a book of its own.  I may even write it someday.  But that's my personal story, not Sheryl Sandberg's.  And Sheryl's story is the reason I read her book.<br /><br />As for being a single parent, for those unaware, mothers suffer more discrimination in the workplace than any other demographic.  It's a serious problem, especially now that we outnumber men in both the workforce and in universities.  When we factor in part-time work with full-time work, pay for women with children hovers at about 60 cents on a man's dollar.  Yep.  That's a number you don't hear much about.  Also, let's quash the myth that kids are a \\"lifestyle choice.\\"  Having children is natural.  If we stop having them the world will, you know, end.  Oh, and society depends on maintaining a birthrate so that people can continue to contribute taxes to Social Security, Medicare, etc.  The problem with having kids in the U.S. is that we have created a culture where having them is unequivocally to the social and economic detriment of women.  Our child support system is arbitrary and inconsistent, and supportive social programs, such as paid maternity leave, affordable daycare, etc., are nonexistent.  For these reasons, our birthrate has stagnated.  As women continue to pursue education at unprecedented rates, this number will stall even more.  It's time to discuss mothers in the workplace.  This is what Sheryl has done.<br /><br />With that said, I'm premising my review on the most common complaints to her book.  Here goes:<br /><br />COMPLAINT: It's a narrow view on a diverse topic.<br />RESPONSE: Well, yeah.  Women outnumber men in the workforce.  To discuss every professional scenario would be virtually impossible.  Sandberg is also in a very unique and lonely position: she is one of the few women at the VERY top.  You don't reach her position without a healthy dose of gender discrimination along the way.  She refused to internalize stereotypes and persevered.<br /><br />COMPLAINT: She's a rich white woman born into affluence.<br />RESPONSE: Unlike many children of affluent families, Sandberg actually attended a public school and still managed to get into Harvard.  Also, millions of females have been born into affluence over the years, so why aren't they proportionately represented in top U.S. companies?  Because getting there as a woman is undeniably difficult regardless of her economic status and social upbringing.<br /><br />COMPLAINT: She's wealthy and has a nanny, maid, etc.  She doesn't understand middle-class or poor women.<br />RESPONSE: Yes, she's wealthy.  No, she's never experienced poverty as a single parent.  But she cares about women's issues and their effect on the workplace.  Deeply.  She actively advocates for flextime and maternity leave -- even when it's not a popular thing to do.  She's also fully cognizant that women continue to be tethered to the home in a way men are not -- especially single moms.  There's a lot that needs to change, and having a woman at the top promoting women's issues is a good thing.  Period.<br /><br />COMPLAINT: She focuses too heavily on women being responsible for their careers and not on the males who dominate the professional world.<br />RESPONSE: A defining feature of oppression is that both dominant and subordinate groups internalize the norms set by the dominant group and accept them as normal.  In other words, women are internalizing -- and perpetuating -- male dominance in the workplace.  This is important because, as I said, women now outnumber men in the workforce.  Therefore, they are part of the solution.  Sandberg thinks weneed to \\"lean in.\\"  She is right.  Those in lower positions (like myself) can collectively group to promote their cause.  I've seen it happen in fields such as nursing.  Of course, this requires a cease fire on the infighting that is so common in these female-dominated professions (i.e. phrases like \\"nurses eat their young\\" exist for a reason).  Stop the bullying and create a culture of respect and collective bargaining power.<br /><br />TAKEAWAY: It's no surprise this book caused an immediate furor.  Infighting is common among oppressed groups -- and, unfortunately, most of the criticism is coming from women.  I won't discuss it here in the interest of length, but a great article on internalized oppression (which Gloria Steinem mentioned in her review) can be found through the University of Kansas on their website \\"The Community Toolbox.\\"  Once you read it you'll never see discrimination or female infighting in the same light again.<br /><br />Sandberg could easily sit on the sidelines and enjoy her status and wealth.  After all, feminist issues are an unpopular topic.  Yet she wrote a book anyway.  To have a woman at the very top fighting for women's rights in the workplace could not be more important.  For those of us in the middle (and the bottom) we have our own experiences.  We too can blog, write books, and give talks on our unique perspectives.  The bottom line is that it's time to lean in and modify the men's rules.  We're here.  We're not leaving.  We have the right to workplace equality and pay.  Let's stop with the infighting and make it happen.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Buyer beware, these aren't the classic films. This is the cut with bloat made by jacka**es. N O Fl Cl Br I.
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a true story which is action packed.the account was written well and keeps you interested the whole way.the writer does his best to portray the story from the heart.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|A must for any Pink Floyd fan. I bought it to play on mp3 players, great sound for that, don't know what it would be like on a real sound system. Still a great album anyway.
0765325950|5.0|So sad that it's the last book. We have lived with the Wheel of time for so many years now. The book was master fully written, and as before the story is moving and breathtaking.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Perfect. Just what I wanted. Wanted small size for pocket and one that worked well. This does both.  Would definitely recommend
B0052AC8C6|3.0|I thought it was cute. The kids really enjoyed it too. One of those cartoons that has something for children and adults.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Movies about police corruption are fairly common but this is one of the greatest of all time.  The character played by Guy Pearce is idealistic and desires to always do the right thing.  Also, his father was a decorated police officer before him.  His greatest desire is to make it to detective.  He is surrounded, however, by corrupt officers and civilians who abuse the system for their own benefit.  Kevin Spacey is a preening peacock and egomaniac who uses his police officer persona to become an adviser to a television program. This time period is when television was just beginning, the fifties.  Danny DeVito plays a tabloid journalist who prints articles about the police and other assorted gossip. Russell Crowe plays a seemingly unintelligent officer who turns out to be more intelligent than he seems. Kim Basinger is a high class prostitute in this movie and she is great in it. The best movie she has been in since nine and a half weeks.  She got an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  Simon Baker plays a gay man trying to make it in Hollywood as an actor.  Simon Baker is now on the \\"Mentalist.\\"<br /><br />The personification of evil in this movie is played by James Cromwell as a veteran police officer who has gotten to the top ranks by hook and crook. He will do anything to protect his turf, including murdering a fellow officer in cold blood.<br /><br />This movie builds to a violent climax and each step towards that conclusion is realistic and nuanced. The movie is based on a novel by James McElroy.  L. A. Confidential, is in my opinion, one of the finest movies made in the last thirty years.  It faithfully evokes the period, the early fifties and the place.  Most of the fine ensemble cast have no scruples.
B009ICQ6KO|4.0|Loved Musselwhite over the years but unfamiliar with Harper.  Really liked them together.  I would recommend this to other blues lovers.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|Won't stay open and play a video. Search for an artist? Nope crashes. Look for a song? Uh huh crashes! It's horrible.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is such a wonderful app, and free too.  I can read or listen to the Bible any time I want and it is available to everyone.  Lots of added perks too.  Try it, promise you will not be disappointed.  I have it downloaded on both my Kindles so I can use it anytime I have a spare moment.  Reread the events portrayed in the TV movie, The Bible, to help you better understand them.  I would recommend this to anyone interested or just curious about the Bible.
B0060AY85C|4.0|Borrowed book from library. Time expired before I finished. Will check it out again. What I did read intrigued me enough to read the rest.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If only more books and publishing were presented this way. But more specifically, if only more books were WRITTEN this way. Fantastic series and really well planned out and written.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Movie is great, but this is the second time I couldn't get the ultraviolet/flixter( aka shister) to work. UV and Flixter are rip offs. I'm paying for something that doesn't work. UV/Flixter support is none existent!!!! I should have waited until the extended version came out (December 2013) and bought it on iTunes!!! Next time I will!!!<br />If I could file a class action lawsuite against UV and Flixter I would. But alas, I'm just a \\"dumb consumer\\"!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am very happy with facebook now loaded on my new Kindle--It is just great and so happy to have it
B00499LTLM|5.0|Exceeded my expectations: super-smart, savvy and serebral (ok, cerebral :).<br /><br />Episodes 1 and 3 of both seasons (1 and 2) are the best of the bunch.<br /><br />Once you start, you won't want to stop.<br /><br />and extra points for layering in visual thinking on top of imagery, including texting on screen.<br /><br />True must-see TV, or streaming - thanks Amazon Prime!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Whether or not you are an introvert Susan Cain does a fantastic job at illustrating the differences of problem solving, mindset, and niches of both personally types.  She does a fantastic job of dispelling the myths around introversion. A great read and especially important for any manager to truly understand your people.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This 3D match puzzle is pretty darn cool.  I stink at it as it usually takes me about 10 minutes to finish a puzzle.  My wife plays it more than I do and looking at her record of 3:20 discourages me.  What I really like about this game are the physics.  The cube can rotate any way and the movement is fluid.  There are two challenges.  One is to start with a full cube and remove each block by tapping on it and its match.  The other is the opposite.  The game starts with few blocks and builds into the cube.  The object here is to see how long you can keep the cube from being completed by finding matches.  To me, this is a unique and fun game for all ages to enjoy.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|was very disappointed that with the exception of 2 areas of this game the user has to pay additional money to use these additional areas - which of course any child will want - adds up to too much money
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I never tried other bible apps.  This one is so good that I've never felt the need to check out any others.  I used to carry my bible with me to bible study.  Now, I just bring either my iPhone or Kindle.  I like being able to switch between different translations.  Sometimes a particular verse just doesn't register in my brain, so I try different translations to help me better understand.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is ok....  it has a few bugs. Sometimes the high scores don't show up on the main screen, when u log into Facebook to play with friends it tells you that you are logged in. But In the game it says you not.... but other than that subway surfers is a fun game with a few bugs.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|Pretty cool idea.  The physics are great and the puzzles get progressively more challenging.  The problem is they can also get monotonous.  Some people will fall in love with this game, but my bet is mainstream users will just have a casual appreciation of this game.  It's definitely not garbage.  The developers got the concept they were aiming for right.  It's a high quality app.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I chose thie rating because this movie is incredible!  It has a lot of good action in it and the story keeps you involved the entire time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Whether you've read the graphic novels first or have seen the show first does not change the enjoy ability factor here. Season 3 continues with strong new character development and does not disappoint !!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Many things on the kindle are extremely small print, but I enjoy using this calculator because the numbers are so large....the display is very easy to read.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Best to use a stylus for drawing but this is a fun game and more enjoyable on the larger screen of my kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing because you can buy boosts to make yourself faster and carry you farther. I would recommend this game for anyone.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Loved the movie in the theatre but so happy to own a copy so I can watch it anytime I want.  It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with the price.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book and series leaving me wanting more and thirsty to read the next page. If you want it, GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game lots of fun never ending ive been playing fir months and almost have all the rooms unlocked. i
B001FB4VY4|5.0|I only started watching this show when TBS got rerun rights.  Too bad they haven't redone seasons three or four like they did one and two for blu-ray and wish three and four also had the Ultraviolet option.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|When reading the eloquent and favorable critics about this movie, I was eager to see it and prepared to be in the grip of a 70 or 90 minutes suspense story. Well, I was disappointed beyong measure because this turned out to be just another version of a so-so story illustrating the (for once) slighly more original machinery inside the CIA. Having said this, I would like to stress that this is my personal opinion ONLY and therfore I may say that I was utterly bored. Adding to imagined outrage by the audience who appreciated this movie, please let me say that I find Mr Ben Affleck a very minor actor with a VERY limited range of convincing portraits of human expressions.<br />So sorry
B0091CWYQ6|4.0|I thought the only way to get better sound was to get better headphones, man was I wrong. The sound improvement with this is very noticeable and the bass boot is great, has a lot of punch and is not muddy. The best part is the price of this device at a bit less that 30 bucks it feels like I got the same sound improvement I would have had if I spent 300+ dollars on headphones. I'm very pleased, the only reason Im not giving it 5 stars is because I ordered a silver one and they sent a black one which to be honest is not that big of a deal to me.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|3 1/2 stars<br /><br />Too many events in the story were solved easily by items placed in the plot.<br />Video game geeks and fans of 80s pop culture would enjoy this book.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I bought this one for myself and I also bought one for my sister. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good Love Story.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|It has no real plot to follow.  The movie kind of jumps around a lot.  It could have been way better & funnier, especially with Paul Rudd.  Watching this movie once is enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg i love this game. Yea its ninja but so much fun and incredibly adictive. i personally would deffo recommend.XOX.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Just as with classic Clancy, lots of fluff...quantity of pages is always important to Tom (and now Mark Greaney).  I enjoyed it and I am re-energized with the new Ryan franchise.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|After seeing the movie, &#34;Sugarman&#34;, I immediately ordered both of Rodriguez's CD's.  I love the simplicity and the message in his songs.  Good purchase.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This is a children's game,since they have a shorter attention span it would be wise to allow them to grow &amp; add pets at a faster rate.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Simple Review: Reminds me of my dad and was a great movie to watch with the family. I liked it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The price of admission was worth every Penney. Looking forward to playing the sequel, no matter what the cost might be.
B001D52XO2|5.0|I purchased this CD and DVD as a birthday gift. I was told that it was the best collection of Nina Simone and they loved it. Would highly recommend it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Are you a nerd, a history buff, or a movie person? Are you an American? Then John Adams is the DVD for you. Quit watching trashy reality shows and infomercials on TV, and instead , pop in this educational but REALLY WELL DONE, exciting series.<br /><br />I watched this entire series in one weekend. I had rented it from the library, but loved it so much that I ended up buying it for keeps.<br />Not only did I buy the miniseries, but I also found out who had written the book it's based on (John Adams by author David McCullough) and I went and bought the book too. And when I had finished the John Adams book, I moved on to 1776, then Truman, then the one about Roosevelt.<br /><br />As you can see, the miniseries John Adams is the gift that keeps on giving. I even wanted to dress up as John and Abigail Adams for our Halloween costumes, but my husband wasn't keen on that idea.
B002UPQ246|5.0|Awesome CD. If you like Otis Redding's music you will love this CD. I definitely recommend this CD to everyone.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|ok. Long and drawn out. Great acting. Great cast. Probable would not watch second time. The video streaming was flawless.
0307949486|3.0|It gave me a headache every time I slogged through 100 pages or so. It was translated from Swedish which may have been partly to blame. The characters drink more coffee and eat more sandwiches than could be possible in a year by the entire US Army! We're told Lizbeth is 4'11&#34; tall and weighs 90 pounds every few pages. The story line would have been much improved by editing out at least a third. That being said, I am glad I stuck with it.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I really like this game, except I can not connect to Facebook. It won't let me log in, so that I can play with others and play tournaments. If someone can help me out here, I would like that.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|A fascinating look at what is required to put on a concert.  A side of MJ that most never got to see.  He was truly gifted.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I do not agree with everyone who says that the adjustments made to the original films destroy the integrity of the entire saga. Yes the movies are slightly different from the originals but I like the changes, they weren't drastic enough for me to justify spending over $150 US for the original productions in DVD form. I had to buy these before Disney puts out a new one, I'm afraid that they are going to blow it but I could be wrong.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|This collection certainly shows why MJ is credited with saving rock and roll.  I have Thriller but this contains far more of why he was so good.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|Easy setup, works well with Acti cameras.  This app actually works better than the manufacture’s software (desktop and mobile app) from the video recorder (QNAP) that I’m using.  Works well on Kindle Fire and Galaxy S.
0805047905|5.0|Both kids LOVE this book, but the 19 mos goes ape when I pull it out!  Of course, you'll have to read it 10 times in a row, but that's the point, isn't it?! She loves anticipating the next animal!  I recommend this book to anyone who asks. :)
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I really love this product. I use it with my Bose OE 2 headphones and it gives it a much higher quality sound – louder, with more bass and clearer treble. Would definitely recommend this product for someone looking to give their headphone experience an extra boost.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|The only way it could be better is if it was easier to place onto the page when you're done and want to clean up. I have used windex to make the stickers &#34;restick&#34; again.  Other than these two things, virtually perfect. And you can't beat the amount of fun for the price.
B0057UVLQ0|5.0|Selena Gomez is going to have a long career. She has a great voice. I hope her group and her gets back together. Good music. I highly recommend it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a really great game.  I'm addicted to this game in only a few hours of playing.  So great...
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app was great, until the content updated and ads started popping up every two minutes. I am very disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Things better get moving soon, or fans are going to turn on the show. And why can't anyone kill the Governor?
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this case it protects the Kindle fire and it acts as a stand so you don't have to hold the Fire while watching mvies or playing games  or reading. It is well made and comes in many colors.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Real life is always filled with unexpected circumstances as well as regrets; it is how we handle such that is a measure of quality of our lives.  This story shows that no matter what, love can overcome tragic circumstances if your open to it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new graphics are really awesome!  This game is a blast to play!  I compete with my brother and Dad for high scores.  Love it!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Rachel Joyce entertained me with this thought provoking novel.  I found myself looking inward several times.  I recommend it to anyone who has a little time and wants to think about life.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I thought The Kitchen House was every bit as good as The Help--and I loved The Help.<br />It was a very quick read and it gave such a great snapshot of what was going on in the South during that period of time.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|If you're a Tom Clancy fan, and a Jack Ryan fan - then this book may be for you. We pick up where we left in Locked On and follow the exploits of Jack Junior, Chavez, Caruso and Clark. The Chinese are at play and have beefed up their IT capacity. Who knows who's a friend. A great romp.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I have the entire saga on DVD/Blue Ray.  I love it and I'd buy it again and again.  Please talk Stephanie Meyer into continuing this series!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Everbody told me how great it was and they were right!  It is by the best show on TV...can not wait for season 3.
B0095P31L6|5.0|With prime I just clicked and play. Kids loved it! Makes our a lot easier to watch movies than ordering them for the kids for 5.99 a movie.
B00004TR2G|5.0|The first two notes will be the sound you get it you don't buy it! It's Williams. It's Jaws. Enough said.
0811869261|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Boutavant is my favorite illustrator of children's books, by far. My daughter loves it and she is not as into picture books as she once was now that she is 7. It's a lot of fun, you can spend hours on each page. Terrific work!
B009HEP41A|5.0|A truely unusual and rich soundtrack. I love it! I kept whistling the dark and vicoius waltz long after hearing it. Buy it. It takes you somewhere that you never thought.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|You can tell this movie was a real labor of love and not just another &#34;let's make another Muppet movie to cash in!&#34; like the awful Muppets Wizard of Oz, etc. Reminds me a lot of the classic Muppet movies and is just a whole lot of fun! My 7 year old daughter LOVES it!!! Bought it for her for her birthday.
B000001GYC|5.0|This is exceptional! You can never EVER fault Barenboim. His technique and mastery towards... everything is unmatched. This is a sure item to have in your collection -- whether you are classically inclined or not.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|Not my favorite but the music is great and the characters are lively! Bought it for my daughter who was in the school play version of the movie. She loves it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A very playable game with slightly underdeveloped characters . . . but good for a .99$ purchase.<br />I would definitely buy more from this company.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Not my favorite PTA movie. Memorable performances but the movie seems to not really go anywhere and it is very hard to care for any of the revolting characters.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Love the program but the current release fails installation. This has been going on now for months - are they ever going to fix it, or is the app now abandoned? Don't buy until you read that it's been fixed.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Honestly this game is a dud. It promises excitement but all you do is push coins to collect coins and prizes. It is so boring and you never have enough coins to get more coins. It is annoyingly slow and will make you feel like your brain is falling out. I wouldn't recommend it even to my worst enemy just because it would be cruel to do so. The only pros that this game has is pretty objects to collect. It is equivalent to torture.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really great game, love playing it to pass the time. Takes a while to earn coins/gems without buying them in the in game shop.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the writing and the story was compelling, but the characters were all such awful people.  I felt dirty when I fiisihed the book.
B0087EACJK|5.0|This game is very good to play! Your 99 cents is so worth! It is very entertaining plus it is very educational and so great! I just love it. :)
B0012YSZGE|3.0|PRODUCT: T2: JUDGEMENT DAY is the BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER!

030716327X|5.0|this book was read to me as a child and i loved it. i bought it for my 2 year old nephew for his 2nd birthday and he loves it, too. he holds the little stuffed bunny while we read the book!
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Its a cute movie, comedy and action in one.  Has great stars in it and is worth renting for Bruce Willis alone.
1476734941|5.0|I have my husband on this diet and he has lost 60 lbs so far. Is very easy to diet this way.
0812992784|3.0|I bought this book because I have enjoyed Salman Rushdie's appearances on TV.  I have not read any of his novels.<br /><br />I liked the book but had problems because of the author's egocentricity.  He writes as though the reader lives inside of his head and knows what he knows.  Therefore, he does not give proper foundation to parts of the story.  This is particularly troublesome in regard to name-dropping.  I don't know who these people are, where they came from, or if they will re-appear later in the story.  If he's boasting about all the movers and shakers he knows, this went over my head, because I am unfamiliar with the glittering literati world he travels in.<br /><br />I did like the book, but the author comes across as a man with an ego the size of a small country.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|She loves the series and watches it every night.  She likes to go back and watch episodes over and over again!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This app has specific  television systems thatit allows you to access. This information is not known until after you buy and activate the app. My local television providers are not on the list. It was a waste of money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The best account if the mission I have come Across. I read the entire book within days. Thanks for allowing us access to the resources of our military and the Bravery of all who were a part of this critical operation.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|If your a fan of kung fu or quintin then you've just gotta buy it!!! This is the best movie that Quintin Terantino has ever made, well besides that military zombie movie with bruce willis he made...what was that movie called???
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|For the price it's great.. I like the company, but you could do a lot better with an electret condenser for only a little bit more, which could also go straight into 3.5mm.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Worst Denzel movie ever made...not for kids!!! And If your a religious person like me, turn it down now before it's too late!!!
1616550414|5.0|The Hyrule Historia is everything a fan of the The Legend of Zelda Series can expect. It is extremelly beautiful, full collored, hard cover in &#34;courage&#34; green with detais in gold. Amazing
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A book you can imagine happening, but Tome Clancy is usually right on when he selects his subject to write about.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book brought to light the story of a woman with amenia, goes slowly at first, but once into the story, it is a WOW.  And the suspense at the end is full of tenseness and unbelievability.  I just happen to grab this book from the Amazon website and it had 4 1/2 stars.  Well worth the read.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I am a fan of Keira Knightley however even she could not save this one.  The strainge staging just didn't make seance. It was to long and I found myself falling asleep... I gave it 3stars because the acting wasn't that bad and the clothing was fabulous.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I had just finished a book on slavery and didn't know what this book was about.  I loved this book; told the story of the south and what happens on a plantation with slavery operating on all levels at that time.  What happens when a son takes over the operation of this plantation, who is angry on many levels for his life, and how it affects the working people of the plantation.  What a great book, alive with words as if the reader was actually there.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a great survival story, and from such a brave woman. A must read. She is a true survivor! Amazing!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Selling a controller without a cable is like selling a console without a power cord. It's completely ridiculous. The cord is extremely cheap to make, and is very simple, so it's not like they saved much money on it. So for this review I can only give it one star. Why only one star? Because the controller is completely useless! It doesn't work at all! I push the power button and it does literally nothing, and pressing the buttons doesn't do anything so I don't see the point of it. It's simply an empty shell without a cable to charge it. It's complete bulls**** if you ask me. So fair warning if you decide to pick this up, IT DOESN'T COME WITH A CABLE. If you already have a cable... Then great! I'm sure it's a good product when you are actually able to power it.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|hungry shark evoluntion is a great game but every time I exit out of the game all the progress is lost. I love the game but I do not want to start from the beginning every time it restarts. please fix this glitch and I will give it five stars.
B001KEGRCA|5.0|My husband and I went to see it at IMAX 3D it was awesome! Glad to relive it at home :)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was so beautifully written and truly original. The imagery was simply stunning. I'm so glad that I had the opportunity visit the night circus- even if it was only in my imagination via this unique story.
B000TU16GS|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read<br /><br />One of the best books I've ever read. I really look forward to reading more of this series.
0805095535|4.0|I haven't had time to read the whole book yet, but I was fortunate enough to hear Paul Auster himself read a number of passages that contained marvelous descriptions of remembered incidents and feelings.  He writes about serious moments and humorous ones, recalling details that hold your attention and awaken your imagination.  A good read, I'm certain, even if Mr. Auster isn't there to read it to you.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|This book is so inspiring on how to live well, beyond mediocrity.  It really helped me and others see themselves as we are.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|This version of Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy isn't nearly as good as the earlier BBC version starring Alec Guinness.  This movie-length version with Gary Oldman is far too short to develop the intricate plot and nuanced characters of Carre's novel.  The Guinness version is five or six episodes long which allows a brilliant treatment of plot and character as well as a very effective use of light and darkness, along with alarming sounds like traffic surging, bells pealing, phones ringing, and sirens blaring, to create a powerful mood of fear and menace.  Also the Oldman movie doesn't adequately explore the central themes of betrayal and trust that are personified by Bill Hayden and Jim Pridoe.  With such an excellent version as the Guinness one available, I don't think the Oldman movie is worth watching.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The 7-year-old that this was bought for was very pleased with the movie.  It arrived in time for her Christmas.
B00846F1YW|4.0|The game is interesting and somewhat challenging. Be aware, however that some of the items you seek are off the screen. Once you figure out how to move it you will be fine. Some of it is a little too easy.
1885167776|5.0|\\"The One Thing\\" focus is something that all managers ahould put into their management process.  I used to ask \\"what is it going to look like when it is finished\\" but after reading and enjoying \\"The One Thing,\\" I have changed this question to \\"what is the one thing that you intend to accomplish.\\" Keller/Papasan are dead solid center with the ideas on achieving focused results by peeling away the skin to get to the most important concept in managing behavior for results.  The book is not only geared for achievement but also it is a fun and easy read.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and believe my management focus will improve by applying this simple concept.  Well Done!!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I totally recommended this book if you are a big one direction fan. Reading this book gives you a big insight of their lives on tour and visiting LA. I would most definitely be reading this book in the future because it's worth it.<br />SHOUT OUT TO MY TRUE DIRECTIONERS!!!
0425252868|5.0|\\"From his turret, Blackie looked in shock at the 109 pilot. A minute before Blackie had prepared to die, expecting the 109 pilot to shoot him from the sky after disappearing behind the tail. But the pilot had never fired. Now, instead, the German fighter pilot flew formation with the American bomber. Blackie abandoned his efforts to clear his guns. Instead, he folded his hands. \\"What are you waiting for?\\" Blackie said quietly as the German's eyes met his.<br /><br />The Franz Stigler who went to Africa to avenge his brother's death would have had an answer. He would destroyed the bomber and killed its crew. But there, in the desert, and over ancient Sicily, the last of Europe's Knights had taught Franz Stigler a new code. The code said to fight with fearlessness and to restraint, to celebrate victories not death, and to know when it was time to answer a higher call.\\" (Page 202)<br /><br />As a man grew up near an air force base (i.e., China Air force in Taiwan) in a pilot family, I enjoy the book immensely. Even at retiring age, I still learn a lot from the characters in this true story:<br /><br />To prevail, especially in situations with risk and uncertainty (being that in a combat mission or on Wall Street), one needs to:<br />  * be proficient in his/her 'trade';<br />  * have the odds on his/her side;<br />  * accumulate experiences;<br />  * handle life's wins and losses sanely; and<br />  * having a touch of grace from 'above.'<br />To prevail with dignity, pride, and with a thankful heart (while looking back), one must always observe his/her code of conduct.<br /><br />This is a great story for all risk takers (aren't we all in life) in generations to come.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Interesting, not an action movie but a tense attention keeping story.  We enjoyed it very much, but the scenes early in the film are very violent.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I watched this move alone. Thank God I didn't subject friends or family to it. One of the worst wastes of talent in a long time.
B00939MIWW|4.0|nice item. have had great success with it. love it to the fullest. i would recommend. nice deal and great buy!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Yes, it is often frustrating because its time consuming to progress without paying for diamonds, ect. And waiting for energy, but to me it is well worth it.

B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Nice to see a Lincoln film not focusing on the assassination.  Really felt the internal struggle.  Acting was great by all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. I  couldn't put it down. The story line was amazingly thought up and well written. It kept me guessing what was to come next.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Very good production and showcase of the last days of Abraham Lincoln. Really enjoyed the movie even though it was 2 hours +.
B004D7GU3C|4.0|Good music, great voice nice Spanish tunes for all types of public and romantic girls, this can be a good birthday present.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it is really loud and it works very well. it is very handy and worth it and ut wakes me up no matter how tired I am
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I think Follett is a terrific writer and enjoyed this book very much. I suggest you read his other books as well.
1250006341|2.0|My main objection here is the lack of information about the characters. Yes, the historical background is good, but where are the actor bios and behind the scenes details? There's precious little in that department. I would also have loved far more input from Julian Fellowes. I appears that a family member of his wrote this book, which may explain its clunkiness. Nepotism at work? How apt, in a way. Yes, the pictures are very pretty, almost too pretty, almost nauseatingly so, very posed and perfect, but I would much rather have seen many more candid shots like the one of the cast members peeking around the back of a car. And how about some stories about the fans, like those auto-club people? And more about the locals and their reactions. I know most Downton fans will love this book, but it could have been so much better. As it is it's just a rather bland, pretty picture book heavy with historical background and light on interesting details about the show itself.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've not read any S. King before - nor seen his &#34;scary&#34; movies. I did like this book very much. It was an enjoyable read.
1884883303|5.0|Great book! A &#34;must have&#34; to help price Vintage instruments. Lots of photos. Well laid out! I get a new one every 3 years, not every year.
B000007SIN|4.0|The item arrived very quickly, a true quality product. Unfortunately the casing was cracked, so I cannot give it 5 stars.<br />I do not want to risk sending it back, for it may get lost in the the transit. The actual disc is flawless, and the quality of sound<br />exceptional.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Matthew Sanca<br />London, UK
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show is unbelievable... Completely fresh and unexpected. Excellent acting, great script and a storyline always keeps me guessing. Claire Danes is unreal. A must-see.
B001EYK52O|5.0|Classic great movie! True old Hollywood. Filmed around the Boston, highly recommend. Better than the second more modern version of Thomas Crown Affair
B00AO686MY|5.0|I was kinda worried when they first came out because Amazon didn't ship mine out for a few weeks, but turns out early copies of this had problems with the DVD being in full screen.  So I was happy that amazon caught this early and delayed my order to fix this!  Otherwise the Blu-ray is really good!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Movie has some funny moments, problem is they seemed to run out of story line. Hence, towards the end the movie just drags on
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph is one awesome movie!  I recommend anyone who liked it to pick up this set.  I don't even own a 3D TV yet, but one day I might, and when I do, I'll have the movie for it!  PICK THIS UP!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|To stay organized and keep track of awesome ideas I find on the Internet.,this app is a must have. It operates so with ease and works with many of my Kindle apps.
B000OT6V00|5.0|Yep its HellBoy on Blu-ray, pretty awesome!  That is pretty much it.  The Hellboy movies are really good and I wish they would make a new one.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I was s happy that this album was insane. I have been meaning to buy it for almost a year now.  The mp3 download transaction worked perfectly and the album is still one of my favorites.
0553801473|3.0|Geore RR Martin, Kills one of the most important characters (Jon Snow)I am very disturbed He allows the Imp to live.And Cersei She should die a long painful death Jon has been extremely helpful to all of the Night'Watch. He allowed those thugs to attack Jon in the most henus way. He left Sansa with that Pimp Little Finger He could have got Arya back to John where she would have been safe. Bran is a skin shifter flying around in a Crow, I mean really what's that about. And what happened to Samwell Tarly and Gilly.there is so much unfinished in book 5. If he does not give these characters a well deserved ending in his next book WINDS OF WINTER I will not buy any more of his novels,  I truly hope he saves Jon Snow because I am in love this  character and at the moment I am a Broken woman LOL. Signed a very disapointed Fan. (Annie) Also I purchased The Hard Cover and some of the printing was faded out.
B00C59AXHY|5.0|I didn't watch this show when it first started airing.  It wasn't till midway through the fourth season that I took the time and gave the show a chance.  All I can say for myself is: better late than never.  The back and forth scenes are full of sarcasm, humor, and intrigue.  The writers work well together to make the show well rounded and never boring.  I'm so glad that I have a way to get the shows and catch up on them.  This is a reminder to me to give things a chance or I might miss out on something wonderful.
B007REV4YI|5.0|On blueray on the new TV...this looked great...and I really enjoyed the story. Much like Casino Royal, Bond had to do some soul searching to find out who he really was.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Wow!  A terrific film from... Norway.  Who would have thought?  I mean, Norway is not the first country that comes to my mind when I'm hunting for a good foreign film to watch.<br />  \\"Headhunters\\" is  compelling from beginning to end.  Clever script; well acted; well done.<br />  Its plot may be a bit heavy on 90 degree turns, but on the other hand, the film makers pull it off.  Even when credulity<br />is being strained a tad.  And unlike so many other so-called \\"thrillers,\\" I don't think too many \\"Headhunters\\" viewers will prematurely see where this one is going.  Which is always a plus unless the plot twists are completely absurd.  And that's not the case here.<br />  Some may find a scene or two to be on the gross side -- as well as some of the violence to be over-the-top and gratuitous -- but that wasn't my reaction.  All of that fit into the context of the film -- and, as with Tarrentino efforts (or \\"Killer Joe\\") -- it worked for me.<br />  And I can't recommend \\"Headhunters\\" highly enough.  It's a true standout in the genre.  And well worth seeking out.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|To be completely honest, I was a little disappointed about the album. The songs are kind of slow, and I was expecting more after waiting for what seemed like an eternity for a new JT album. If you're wondering why I still gave it 5 stars though, it's because it's JT and I can't give him anything less.<br />I'm well aware that I sound like a creep by saying that. But it's true!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|If you read The Perks of being a Wallflower, then you'll appreciate this book. Starts out with a typical teen-romance-drama with a steamy first kiss, first dry hump,etc. And just when you think you're gonna start fantasizing that it's you this is being done to...the real plot of the book unfolds. Without giving too much away, you can easily feel guilty for getting sexually turned on in the first place.<br />**Spoiler Alert**The only scene that was stupid, but may be realistic (knowing the desperate and horny genders of today) is that when something traumatic happens, the characters find comfort in sex. Personally, if I witness death I wouldn't try to get laid.<br />Happy Readiings!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|loved it, very informative. It was one of those messages that most don't want to hear, but need to hear.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love playing this game, and so do my kids, a brilliant kindergartener, and a vivacious three-year-old! It does have a few drawbacks that I couldn't help but notice:  In many areas, I will try to make a move, but I will still fall off a cliff or careen into a tree. Other times, I won't be able to grab jewels and other treasures, even though I have jumped in time to grab them. The train is fun, but I find it just a wee bit annoying that, when leaning to accommodate the single rail, it will throw me over the outside (not to be mistaken with the inside rail drop where the rail is broken). My biggest pet peeve, though, has to be that no matter how fast I run, and no matter what the distance should be between me and that ugly as sin monster, he always manages to grab me almost immediately. (What exactly is that thing, Anyway?) Other than these minor fallacies, the game is excruciatingly addictive, leaving one with too much time on their hands to often lose hours of their day, frequently not checking the clock, leading them to play well into the wee hours of the morning. This is evident, as it is what I am doing now, lol! At least I enjoy the game enough that I can laugh each time I am killed -- it is hilarious!!! Four-star rating for the time-consuming killjoys. Would've been five-star otherwise. But seriously, does anyone know what that monster is supposed to be? The best I could come up with was that it may be the skull of a clouded leopard atop the body of a super-large gorilla, the likes of which haven't been seen since the movie, &quot;Congo&quot;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game. Though you can only do about 1/3 of the stuff you can do in the full version for pc and xbox. And the maps are pretty small.<br />But the game is just right for on the go playing, and playing with other people on my wifi is very fun. My rating, 5/5
B00004T0P1|5.0|this was great crystal clear an just beautiful exactly what i wanted will be ordering really soon an wil tell others about this
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|The movie was funny, not as funny as part 1, but still enjoyable!! I look forward to part 3 soon.
B008602KQI|5.0|I don't read young adult fiction and I normally don't watch movies like this, but I am glad I did. I thought it was a marvel of storytelling and was well acted and produced. The intensity of the emotions of the actors was honest and well crafted. I read some of the negative reviews and I'm sure the WWE crowd doesn't like it, but that is the problem with all well made films. giving the movie a one star rating because your DVD wasn't what you expected is kind of shallow and pointless. It is my hope that this is the beginning of a trend in action films that will come in the future.<br /><br />The Ads for this film made it seem like a Vampire diary type of tenny film, which is far from the truth.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I'm hooked on SONS.  Katie Segal and Charlie Hunan are my favorite characters.  They really have depth great story line.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|Season 2 of American Horror Story is the best season of a show I have ever seen. I found season 1 to be boring, predictable, and a chore to watch.<br />I think season one would be perfect for people who are into something like twilight because it focused too much on some love story with a little horror thrown in.<br /><br />But season two has everything including some of the best acting and a ridiculously interesting story.
B000GIWRIY|2.0|I have no idea what happened to Jethro Tull (and Ian Anderson) in the 70s. Whatever it was, it must have been a really traumatic experience because everything up through \\"Thick As A Brick\\" is really great, and EVERYTHING after that masterpiece is donkey doo doo garbage. This is a little better than the trash JT has been putting out for 20 years, but not much.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|We all have troubles. Some people's are worse than mine. Yet broken down to its components life is simple.<br />Happiness is everywhere and available if you look for it.<br />I loved this storey.<br />Not being into sport I loved the insight into a fanatical team supporter.

AVOID this trash!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|would make a great short story.  as a novel it seems shallow and wordy because there is not enough substance to pull off justifying a novel sized tale out of this.  Plot a bit far fetched, the 3 main characters r average at best.  And the authors technique of dualing time zones after every short chapter is tiresome.  Fortunately its a kindle book so it was easy to skip read to the end.

B001O2N0P0|5.0|This is one of U2s best albums in quite some time.  After the incredibly boring, lackluster All That You Cant Leave Behind, there was no way but up but this wasnt just better by comparison, its a genuinely excellent album.  Sadly, it was followed by yet another relatively mind numbingly dull record thats notable only for being utterly forgettable.  Hopefully the upsoming album returns them to their former glory.

B001OGWY1W|5.0|Good Movie, worth the rent.  Nice to stream the movie live from home.  Amazon prime is great and not expensive to rent.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Auto moves are slow. Colors are not always right. Might be coby, but might be softwae. All in all, agood game.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|This album is their best yet. There is not one song on here I don't like. I think they really outdid themselves with this one, and I cannot wait to hear them sing these songs on the tour. I have to save my absolute faves are We Own Tonight, Remix (I like the), Whisper, Crash, Now or never and \\"block party\\" * that one came with Itunes dl* this album is SO worth it. Its more ballads on this one, but even they are great haha, just an album worth the money. These guys still got it!!!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|We were excited and pleased with our VHS replacement movie. It truly is a classic, as is Barbara herself. Huzzah
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Absolutely amazing! These men are so talented I can not wait for the concert! Each one of these songs are so unique! even though I purchased mine  from Target to get the 2 \\" Bonus Tracks\\" I had to give my review because I have loved NKOTB since I was a little girl ( I'm almost 26 now and I still plan on marrying Donnie one day ;)hehe) \\" Shes a killer \\" from Target is a GREAT song!)<br /><br />So yes I 100% recommend this album! you will fall in love with it! NKOTB never disappoints! All Blockheads know this!
B0058YPL66|5.0|An event we never miss on Sunday nights. So well performed and amazingly creative. It kinda ties in all the stories we grew up with and makes them almost believable in many ways.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is a fun app.  I don't have a piano in my home right now so it is nice to play a little tune every now and then.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book like all ozf John's books is a delight.  It had me laughing out loud many times even in public places like on an airplane.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I thought this movie was great, the kids will love this one. I would rate this movie a AAA for a super show.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I have to start my review by saying this: at first, I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in seeing this movie. But lately, I have come to a startling conclusion: the movies I sometimes overlook or forget about are the ones that are better or that I should be watching. That Said, Silver Linings Playbook is a great movie. The movie stars Bradley Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany. I have to say not only was I glad that Jennifer Lawrence win the much deserved Academy award, but Bradley Cooper gives a surprisingly  great performance. The Chemistry their characters(Pat & Tiffany) have is almost instant and stays that way the entire movie.<br />Some supporting cast include Robert De Niro(who was nominated for his role and has a very memorable quote in the movie that to this day is still stuck in my head), Chris Tucker(who did a great job as well) Jacki Weaver; Julia Stiles is also in SLP. I need not tell you that the supporting cast all did an amazing job in this movie.<br />The Storyline is realistic as it is relatable. David O Russell did a Wonderful job crafting, and directing Silver Linings Playbook.<br />2012 was one of the best years (in a long time) for books being adapted into movies. Silver Linings Playbook is one of (if not the main) reason why. In my opinion, it did what very few of the other Oscar nominated movies could do: Live up to the hype.<br />Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt, an extremely remarkable movie that will be with you even after the movie is over.<br /><br />5 stars
1452110581|5.0|Anyone knowing cats should get this.  I'm still laughing about it.  Very funny to read and realize the author certainly knows cats too..
086571701X|5.0|really comprehensive book for the aquaponics starter. I used it for what I would need to start my fish farm I found more online but a really great place to start.
1449410243|1.0|I love cat humor, and there are lots of good humor books out there.  This one isn't one of them.  It wasn't until the last quarter of the book that there was something very funny.  I have no idea how it made it to a best seller list.  I consider myself a liberal cat humor person. I loved 101 uses for a dead cat back in the 70s. Having cats gives you a whole different sense of humor anyway.  The book was just not funny through the most part.  I even went back and reread some of it.  Nope, just wasn't.  Got this book for a gift, and ended up chucking it in the trash. No kidding.  Not even a charity gift.  No way.
0385349947|5.0|Don't just listen to the media hype about this book:  read it yourself.  There are very astute observations about how men and women work together and valuable suggestions of how small improvements in the way we communicate could allow the work environment to benefit everyone, especially the business itself.
B0002BO05S|5.0|Purchased and initially viewed DVD exactly 1 year ago..loved it then and watched again this past Resurrection Sunday with family. This is one of the best Bible epic films on the life and times of Jesus and is a great selection to have in your video library. Filmed in 1965, the video production is of good visual and audio quality lasting a little over 3.5 hours. Highly recommended for Bible Study groups. You will not be disappointed. I never, ever grow tired of watching these type of films that glorify our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|From beginning to end, everything about this game is pure perfection.  The plot, characters, dialogue, puzzles, etc. are all top notch, and I can't really think of another gaming experience like it.  Kind of unfair to say though since visual novel style games are very niche and few and far in between.  If you're looking for a nonstop action gaming experience, then by all means move along.  However, if you want a slow paced game rich in story, character development, puzzle solving, and you don't mind reading 85-90% of the time, then this is the game for you.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|This CD is so soothing - I have literally listened to it so often that I have it memorized. I highly recommend it for anyone who wishes meditative relaxing comfort.
0062197266|4.0|Several times I was going to stop reading this because the pace was a little slower that I was used to, but curiosity always got the best of me.  Right until the end of the book, I wasn't sure who was telling the truth and if the truth was truly known by anyone.  A very unusually written book with some very unexpected twists and turns.
1582701709|5.0|It's great to be able to read the text after seeing the film a few times. I can underline and revisit those special places when needed.
B008764ZQ4|4.0|This musical is great for anybody who likes classic rock. My husband hates musicals, but he liked this movie and we still listen to the soundtrack.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is 40 is a great movie, I was laughing all through the movie. True comedy on life at 40.
0307341550|1.0|I don't know how but I did finish this book, but only just.<br />About a hundred pages in, I skipped incessantly. It started off so promisingly, with suspense and two murders, a semi-likable lead in troubled reporter Camille, and the impending investigation. The 'investigation' consisted of Camille wandering aimlessly around her old home town, interviewing residence in connection with the murders but yielding no answers. There were more scenes with her frequenting bars and drinking than anything else. Her mother, bat-s*** crazy, added some spice to the otherwise bland, boring storyline but not much.<br />The final twenty pages or so woke me out of my stupor, when all was revealed. To be honest, I hardly cared who the killer was or why the girls were targeted at this stage, but I was pleasantly surprised to find my assumption was incorrect. At least Gillian Flynn can still surprise me.<br />I thought this book would restore some appreciation for Gillian Flynn after the disastrous Gone Girl, and though I did like this one more, it;s only because Sharp Objects kept me (mostly) awake. It was still a waste of time and I wouldn't recommended it.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|This movie was okay. the music was great but the story was kinda lame. nothing that we haven't seen before. but only with the characters singing. i did though thought that tom cruise did a good job and i loved hey man(the monkey) i thought that he was funny. but all in all this was not a very good musical. if you hve not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
B000002LFZ|4.0|Great collection of most of the hits from this great and classic band.  Mick Fleetwood drumming has always been a favorite of mine.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack. It is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
B00000DGUY|4.0|Great album of any fan of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler.  The Brothers in Arms song has always been my favorite.
B008JFUN8C|5.0|I thought that this movie was awesome. i thought that it did justice to the wizard of oz. it is about time they made the wizard's origin story. this is also the origin story to the wicked witch as well. the special effects in this film are fantastic. and i thought that james franco was pretty good. and so was everyone else. i have a feeling that there will be a sequel to this movie. if the same person writes the script and the same person directs it the sequel should be good. only if disney makes it. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0920668372|5.0|My wife got this book for Easter for me to read to my three and a half year old; I was unfamiliar with the book and as we sat on the couch with her snuggled into my side, I began to read; as I read each page I was thinking that this book is very intense but I kept reading until I got towards the end and the emotions shot right through me and I found myself struggling to finish as I had to hold back the tears. I am a big burly toughie and this book brought me to some resident memories and I was floored by the powerful story line. The book in a word is amazing. My little one now asks me to sing the song to her every night. I do!
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|the conclusion to the dark knight returns finaly came. and it was not disapointing. i thought part 2 was better than part 1. i loved the tension between batman and the joker. you finaly get to see those two duke it out until the death. and the fight between batman and superman was pretty good to. but all in all i don't like superheroes fighting each other. but it was a good fight. i thought the female robin was a good twist but she could of had more action scenes. but all in all this movie was awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0036S4C6G|4.0|This is a book that immediately captured me. Vivid characters, intelligent and insightful thinking and a flair for detail.<br /><br />The interlocking stories kept me going for awhile, but when you start a fresh section every chapter it's also easy to become distanced from the story. That definitely happened and at times I found whole chapters rather dull. Others kept me glued to the page.<br /><br />Although the final chapter was interesting, it felt out of joint with the story to set it in a mythical future that had &#34;massive catastrophe&#34; as part of their history.<br /><br />I'm not a person who insists on wrapping things up, but the final chapter did fizzle out for me.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|This movie is awesome. i loved this movie as a kid and i still love this movie as an adult. i thought that the extenede version is pretty good. i can see why they cut it down when it was first released in theaters. the only thing i can say that i did not like about the extended version is that i think the portabello road dance sequences draged on for a long time. but i can let that slide since this is such a great movie and a disney classic. if you have not seen this movie then i recommned you do
B003L77FYS|5.0|another good season.  Kate realizes how much Castle brightens her days.  Castle sees more sides to Kate's personality.  Esposito and Ryan are less comic relief and more complex characters.  And, OMG, Capt. Montgomery is ...!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is addictive. Great read for those who like twists and such erotic moments. It might even give you some fresh ideas to spice up your love life.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Buble has a great voice, great phrasing, enthusiasm.  A worthy heir to Sinatra's kingdom.  It's obvious he enjoys what he's doing, which makes it doubly enjoyable for the listener.  This album is a nice mix of classics (the title tune, The Best is Yet toCome, I've Got the World on a String) and more recent hits.  I look forward to listening to Michael Buble for many years to come.

B005S9EK5Y|3.0|If you're a Les Mis fan like me you might be a little disappointed in a few aspects of this film.  First, they leave out words...words like the entire intro to \\"On my own\\".  They leave a verse out of \\"castle on a cloud\\" and \\"a little fall of rain\\".  Things that may seem little unless you spend a lot of time listening to the 10th anniversary dream cast like I do.<br />Next, during the \\"master of the house\\" song, a fellow dressed up as St. Nick is \\"comically\\" led into the inn and taken up stairs by a prostitute and....yeah.<br />Something that Hollywood threw in to be \\"funny\\" I guess.  Obviously this guy is only portraying a character dressed up like we have our modern day mall Santa's but I still found it, personally, to be in poor taste.<br /><br />The rest was good and I personally think that Russel Crowe, who I'm not normally crazy about, did an amazing job as Javert.<br />On the other hand I thought that Marius was disappointing (sorry guy who played him). Possibly the worse one I've seen.  This of course is all personal reflection on the production.

B002ZCDR88|2.0|My review title can have two meanings.  Perhaps I just don't get this release.  My recommendation would also be...just don't get it.  If you enjoy hearing Natalie's voice, that's one thing.  By all means, go ahead and buy this.  But, to me, I just can't stomach this one.  I tried.  Gosh I tried.  I love Natalie's music and she MAY have been an influence in the naming of one of my children.  But I just find the subject matter too nonsensical and random.  I'm sure Ms. Merchant is successful enough to never need to cut another commercially-oriented album (or whatever you want to call it these days).  But I sure wish she would... What I would give for another Ophelia...

B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|This travel video shows a lot of the beauty that is New Zealand. It definitely sold me! New Zealand is definitely high up on my future travel plans!<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but too often than not, it felt like more time was to show the splendor of New Zealand. It does bother me that it wasn't condensed into one movie. Also it bothers me that I have to wait till Christmas for the Bluray version that will actually include the extras that I enjoy so much. Furthermore, I feel the digital format of the movie is overpriced. If movies were around the 7.99-9.99 price point, I'd probably buy 4-5x's more digital movies, however, once it breaks the $10 barrier my willingness to buy is reduced significantly.<br /><br />Purchasing the HD version does provide you with the half-dozen or so webcasts. Unfortunately, you have to go through the credits to get to them. It is almost be easier to watch them online. There's no quick way to jump to them. I'm not sure if this a limitation to my Samsung Bluray player or the technology of streaming. Even on the computer, I'd be able to click and close to instantaneously jump to that point. The buffering from Amazon gets a bit annoying, too. Especially when it happens in the middle of the movie or when you want to jump back a bit because you missed a detail.

B0002VFXFE|4.0|It's been awhile since hooking up a computer. The last time I had to use thermal compound that wasn't pre-applied is close to 7 years. Back then I was told to put it on and spread it out with a pieces of plastic. Well this method is quite messy and really wrong! The best way to apply thermal compound is to apply a little dollop in the center and let the heat sink spread it out. Anyway, I used way more than is necessary.<br /><br />Anyway, not much else. Good stuff. Use it. Apply it properly and a small container of this stuff will last you a long time.

B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Sempiternal is the fourth full-length studio album from the controversial, genre-defying British band Bring Me The Horizon. It was released in 2013 on RCA and was produced by Terry Date. The album sees Jordan Fish joining the band full-time as Keyboardist and former guitarist Jona Weinhofen leaving the band.<br /><br />The first two things you may notice about the record if you've heard the band before are firstly that it's a lot less heavy and a lot more experimental. Secondly, Olly's clean vocals have got a lot better. At the start of the album, it seems like he's improved a bit, but by the end you can hear a gigantic improvement.<br /><br />A lot more time on the album is spent on clean vocals and soft melodies too. There is also a lot of places designed for crowds to sing a long to and a focusing on the electronic side that appeared a bit on Suicide Season and a lot on There Is A Hell.<br /><br />This album opens right up into those atmospheric, electronic filled melodic moments. Its reminiscent of the style of tracks like `Don't Go' and `Blessed With A Curse,' where the music has a lot of space, keys and absolutely all the death growls and blast beats from the early days have been removed. From then on there's a lot of tracks like `Sleepwalking,' `And The Snakes Start To Sing' and `Seen It All Before' that fit into that style, but taking it in a range of different tempos and directions. Most will bring a bit of heaviness in at times, but nothing as extreme as anything on the band's first two albums.<br /><br />`The House Of Wolves' brings back a bit of the British Hardcore scene influence, but that's melded with the melodic, electronic style too. There's a great breakdown, and some fast sections. `Shadow Mosses' blends a little bit of the past back in to the sound too, but with a lot of their new direction. `Crooked Young' is fairly heavy and bombastic, but has been hugely injected with the additional electronic elements. The album isn't a repetition of their previous albums, but it definitely is a logical evolution.<br /><br />The album is very dense sounding in terms of production style and how many little touches go on at once. Even when in essence all that's happening is something as simple as a drumbeat continuing over feedback after the rest of the music dropped out, the sound is absolutely massive. So when all five musicians are going, and there's keys, strings sections and guitar leads sneaking in and out, while the producer manipulates the sound like an instrument in itself at times, the record is very interesting.<br /><br />Highlights include `Go To Hell For Heaven's Sake' which has a very catchy feel and some of the best drumming on the record, `Anti-vist' which is one of the album's heaviest moments and the immense album closer `Hospital For Souls' which is incredibly cinematic and evocative.<br /><br />At the end of the day it's a difficult album to recommend since the band have so many detractors anyway and its quite a departure so even their own fans might dislike it. Not everyone will like this album. Some people will always hate the band because of their reputation and personalities. Some previous fans will hate the new direction that's so far away from their early work. Some people will just not enjoy it.<br /><br />I personally couldn't be happier with the record however. I think it's a masterpiece. The songs are enjoyable, the melodies are great and all the extra studio touches are interesting. It's a very original sounding and emotionally powerful record with a lot to offer and one that really captures my imagination.<br /><br />If you do chose to listen to it, go into it with an open mind and take it for what it is. It might not be to your tastes admittedly, but at least give it a fair chance because you may just discover your new favourite album.revious albums, but it definitely is a logical evolution.<br /><br />The album is very dense sounding in terms of production style and how many little touches go on at once.

B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Title says it all.  Story is probably funnier if you are at or near this age. Portion of the movie is a little depressing. But overall funny and enjoyable.
B00B4W8AIW|5.0|Killswitch Engage are a melodic Metalcore band from Massachusettes, and Disarm The Descent is their fifth full-length studio album (sixth, if you count the band's half-hour self-titled debut effort from 2000).<br /><br />It was released in 2013, following-up 2009's self-titled record. It was produced by the band's guitarist, backing vocalist and former drummer Adam Dutkiewicz and mixed by Andy Sneap. Like most of the band's releases, the artwork was handled by bassist Mike D'Antonio.<br /><br />After three albums with Howard Jones in the lead vocal position, Disarm The Descent sees the return of the band's original singer Jesse Leech, who had last held that position on 2002's Alive Or Just Breathing album, (although he had periodically turned up in guest appearances, live shows and side projects in the intervening years)<br /><br />The album opens up with blasts and angular Swedish sounding music, like some of the band's earliest work, but soon returns to the sound that you'd expect from the band at this stage in their career. They are one of the genre's pioneers and over their career have developed an easily identifiable signature sound, that makes a welcome return, however the band seem to have attempted to bring back a bit of the bite and edge of their early days to avoid sounding too polished and smoothed-down.<br /><br />The album runs a lot of the same course that the band have covered before. Throughout the record, there are triumphant sounding lead guitar lines, flashy solos, crunchy breakdowns and a mixture of precision riffing with uplifting melodic moments. There's the fast, spidery touches and hammering double kicks on `New Awakening,' there's a slower moody moment with `Always' and there's the aforementioned blasts and Gothenburg influences on tracks like `The Hell In Me' and `All That We Have.'<br /><br />The lead single `In Due Time' is a good taster of the album as a whole. Most of the elements that the album covers are present to some degree or other within its duration and it gives you a good measure of what the band and Jesse sound like at this moment in time, which in a word would be \\"revitalized.\\"<br /><br />One area in which the album really shines is in the lead guitar work. Its seems like an extra special effort has gone into making impressive sounding guitar solos, and making them in large numbers. The vocals are also noteworthy. Extra care and attention has been put into the layering and combination of differing varieties of screams, shrieks, growls, shouts and singing.<br /><br />While the record still sounds unmistakably like Killswitch Engage, most of the music on the album is in the higher end of the tempo range that the band work in. Its main mode is `fast,' and this combined with the studious approaches to lead guitar and vocal layering give the album its unique selling point among the rest of the band's catalougue.<br /><br />Album highlights include `A Tribute To The Fallen,' `No End In Sight' and `Time Will Not Remain.'<br /><br />Overall; If you want a collection of brief, punchy, Melodic Metalcore songs then you could do worse in 2013 than checking out Disarm The Descent. Its consistent, it sounds great and it delivers exactly what you want from the band with a slight twist and the right kind of energy.r within its duration and it gives you a good measure of what the band and Jesse sound like at this moment in time, which in a word would be \\"revitalized.\\"<br /><br />One area in which the album really shines is in the lead guitar work.

B00A0SLTCU|4.0|First off this is not a remake of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.  If you buy it thinking it is, you will be either very disappointed or very surprised.  It is a movie that has taken the basic premise of that movie, artificial memory implantation, and then constructed a very different story around it from what the original movie had.  That having been said, it's not a bad action flick.  Acting is professional - nothing super - but the action is good.  Take it for what it is and enjoy.

B009AMANBA|4.0|How to make a film about the most important figure and period in US history? You just go ahead and do it, find a great book Doris Kearns Goodwin's historical account \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\" as a primary source), get a great script writer in Tony Kushner in Munich, get good actors ( Daniel Day-Lewis) and company and helm it under the auspices of Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />It begins with an amazing scene, where an African American soldier recites to Lincoln the words of his Gettysburg address. The nation is at war, and Lincoln is trying to pass the 13th Amendment. His secretary of State William Seward ( David Strathairn) is reluctant and considers it impossible. The film shows Lincoln's political acumen as he relies on lobbyist, cutting deal and pleading to get this done. He was a great politician even before he became a great president. It is intimate look at the happenings behind the 13th Amendment. However the entire film does not focus on this aspect alone, we get glimpses of Lincolns domestic life as a father who struggles to give permission to his son Joseph Gordon Levitt to enlist in the Union Army and his relationship with his adviser and wife, Sally Field.<br /><br />This is an amazing film with very engaging performances helmed by Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. Each and every character is well researched and acted. This is an extremely<br /><br />long movie about 2 hours and 32 minutes, but extremely engaging- no loo breaks.<br />A masterful portrait about one of the greatest figures in the history of America and the period when disagreement was natural but yet political parties were able to work together amidst considerable friction.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|The first album to be released following Khan's departure from the band certainly does not disappoint! Looking back on the previous couple of releases, it is actually not hard to acknowledge that there was something lacking - an essential spark that had helped to define Kamelot for me. Whether it was due to the band as a whole or simply Khan being burned out, I couldn't say for sure, but the transition to a new singer with all the adjustments such a thing demands has seemed to reignite it! I can think of no tracks that I dislike on this one, and the packaging and included printed materials are sturdy and durable, so I expect to be able to enjoy it all in excellent condition for a long time!

B0087EACJK|5.0|This game is a fun mashup between a platformer and a sliding puzzle game. You control a stick figure, and the goal is to find a key and get to the door while avoiding spike pits and other obstacles. But, the entire world is made of tiles that you can slide around like a giant sliding puzzle. You can also rotate the device in order to change the direction of gravity, which is a fun mechanic too.
B00B5JBZGS|4.0|Return To Form!<br /><br />Killswitch Engage are the brahma bull of what is now known as Metalcore.  In 2002, it was just \\"music.\\"  That same year, the industry seemed to be eclipsed by some major titles (Shadows Fall, etc.) including \\"Alive Or Just Breathing.\\"  In a strange way, AOJB is what \\"Fall of Ideals\\" is to All That Remains.  It's a timeless record, that in any given situation, a seasoned KSE fan can put on their iPod and be transported back more than a decade.  \\"What is this nonsense, I'm gonna go rip Alive or Just Breathing,\\" is a common expression especially since I am from MA.  It's and archetype many have followed, tried to replicate, and spawned an over saturated genre.  It should come to no surprise that everyone is putting all their hopes and dreams in the prodigal son, Disarm the Descent.<br /><br />People will always have their own opinions regarding Howard and Jesse.  Objectively, I can't quantify who is better.  Jesse's vocal range is completely different than Howard's.  Alive or Just Breathing is/was his swan song.  However, the best window to find answers may reside in KSE's 2005, \\"World Ablaze\\" DVD.  Particular songs like \\"Self Revolution, Temple From Within,\\" and \\"Life to Lifeless\\" showcase Howard's delivery of Jesse's material.  I will let you all stand firm on your opinion, but in mine - Jesse is a better lyricist, Howard is NOT a better singer, but a MORE DYNAMIC vocalist.<br /><br />DTD has incredible buzz!  It IS everywhere!  It's as if there will be a cataclysmic shift in the industry that will shake the fabrications of music.  It's almost overwhelming.  What some people fail to realize is that, it's been more than a decade since AOJB released.  Bands have been innovating the genre, some soar, others plummet.  Regardless, Disarm the Descent isn't a fatality on the proverbial \\"kombat\\" of music.  Does that mean it's bad - NO!  It does justice to their name and restores faith to an exhausted genre.  Lyrically, Disarm the Descent heads backto empowering words instead of mushy gushy love songs over-saturated in KSE's Self Titled release.  The interior strength Jesse's provoke's is difficult not to attach to.  His performance on this record is his best catalogue of songs.  Jesse can make you shrill as well as emotional.  Disarm the Descent has incredible hooks, intensity,  but at times, can get repetitive.<br /><br />The album wastes no time thrusting you into a barrage of sharp riffs, sheering screams, and a hint of groove metal (thanks to Andy Sneap).  What's readily apparent is the haste at which Jesse delivers the hooks and choruses.  Over the years he's ironed out his voice and gives fans immediacy. \\"The Hell In Me\\" is one hell of a thrash opener, followed by the melodic powerhouse \\" Beyond the Flames.\\"  Here, Jesse showcases his improved harmonies sandwiched between ripping verses.  It may be my favorite on the record.  The solo on \\"New Awakening\\" isn't drawn out, it's quick and harsh, although the song is par for the course.  Another personal favorite, \\"A Tribute to the Fallen\\" has all the ingredients I love about KSE.  It hearkens back to AOJB with soaring choruses, thrash, underlying melodies, anthemic lyrics, and top notch performances by all members.  This is the one song that stuck with me for my first 10 listens, and still continues to ensnare me with its rhythm.  Then - all of a sudden - \\"Turning Point\\" hits; bellowing opening riffs and deep chugging demonstrate KSE's depth/growth.  \\"All That We Have\\" has a distinct staggering bounce.  At times, it sounds like pots and pans falling that ironically sound natural.  \\"You Don't Bleed For Me\\" jumps back into classic KSE fashion while using an entertaining spoken word interlude.  \\"The Call\\" is heavy and anthemic with groove-esque riffs.<br /><br />With all these elements I've just stated, it's difficult to gripe about the record because WE WANT it to be this \\"end all be all thing.\\"  But it's not, it's a solid record from a solid band.  It is upto you do identify if DTD is better than AOJB.  Remember nostalgia doesn't mean better.  These guys are tighter, and more creative than in previous albums.  The downfall is that, you know what to expect after the first few songs.  Killswitch does what Killswitch does best.  But to quote another artist, \\"If you have 10 to 12 tracks on a record, don't waste your fans time with the same song after song?\\"  This is appropriate for KSE because you get easily accustomed to the manor and flow of the album.  The pacing is for the most part, linear.  There aren't any real \\"OMG\\" surprises and twists you contemplate later.  Strangely enough, the title track resides in one of the bonus tracks.  I wish it replaced one of the other songs, to add continuity and it's more appropriate for the record.  Nonetheless, Disarm the Descent is incredibly enjoyable for veteran KSE fans.  Tight production, heightened level of intensity, and an inherent theme make Disarm the Descent a return to form.  Disarm the Descent is a worthy Kombatant not brought here by chance.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was exactly what I needed!  Very well written and well laid out. It should be required reading for anyone thinking of writing a book.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Bring Me the Horizon are back with their pivotal follow up to 2010's There is a Hell.  Even with cascading riffs, powerful vocals, and bouncing choruses, Sempiternal enlists an underlining layer of trickery.  Isolating these moments takes many listens, but inevitably adds incredible depth.<br /><br />Sempiternal is Oli's crescendo.  In an industry plagued by \\"chug chug's\\" and angsty teens trying to sound angry, Oli evokes the actual tone of the word.  For instance, when he says \\"...Can You Fix the broken,\\" or \\"...Throw Me to the Flames, Watch Me Burn,\\" we as an audience understand, sonically, their sensation.  The delivery and distortion of Oli's voice generates tangible visions of the lyrics.  This furthers our attachment to the work because that \\"is how it would sound and feel.\\"  It's not sound for the sake of sound, but emotion for the sake of tone.  You see hundreds of cliche lyric videos on youtube trying to sound mad, instead of harmonizing the words with their enunciation's.  Oli confronts this concept head on and nails it.<br /><br />A producer should always take bands in a new direction, in terms of sound that is.  No one record should replicate another.  The most meticulous engineered album can still fall victim to sameness.  Fans identify this easily and see it as a sidestep or \\"b-sides.\\"  It's the subtle anxiety and confidence in the producer that creates something definitive. Terry Date (whose list goes on an on, including Deftones) has a particular style.  Deftones are unique because they are heavy, yet incredibly transient.  Their archetype of sound can put listeners in a trance, while at the same time explode.  They're the only band to force fans to exist at an imbalance, or balance depending on how you see it.  Sempiternal flirts with this concept on its sleeve.  Thanks to Terry Date, he and BMTH barricade listeners into some of the most emotional and driven songs in the genre.<br /><br />All members step their game up, making sure nothing sounds cluttered or stagnant.  The genius of the songwriting comes in these \\"huge\\" moments.  Similar to Pink Floyd, BMTH center on one or two key moments in each song to make it sound monumental alla - \\"Empire.\\"  They're like signatures, sometimes enhanced through careful gang vocals or ambient spoken word interludes (Can You Feel My Heart).  Instruments drop in/out to isolate what THEY want YOU to hear/feel.  The most prominent of course, Jordan Fish's keys.  Not to mention the full orchestra BMTH had in the studio recording with them.  Cellos, violins, and an expert programmer reinforce the Sempiternal's identity of sound.  At this level, it becomes art.<br /><br />The overall pacing of Sempiternal is flawless.  BMTH control the tempo, offering needed reprieves before plunging back into the fray.  These intervals, although a bit slower are not short on impact (\\"Shadow Moses\\" into \\"And the Snakes Start to Sing\\", then \\"Seen it All Before\\").<br /><br />Lyrically, there is an overall story arc.  Each song is a tributary leading to the overall narrative.  For us, the audience, it's incredibly satisfying to perceive these themes and create individual meaning.  Oli starts with the most base idea (heart), then cascades into a myriad of faith, deception, hope, a sick sense of optimism resulting in an inevitable implosion.  I will dive into this later when I dissect each song.<br /><br />\\"Can You Feel My Heart\\" functions anatomically, like circuitry of our hearts.  Immediate electric bounces kicks off the record with a bang.  Repeating riffs and musical cues amplify the track's reverberations.  Oli's sick sense optimism is conveyed via dialogue and sound of the track.  \\"The House of Wolves\\" introduces a bit of narrative driven by metaphors  (Wolves/Jackals), referring to their house as \\"...burning like a thousand suns.\\"  If you care to take it a step further, the thousand suns is an allusion to spiritual enlightenment.  So it's as if he wrought this search for \\"truth\\" upon himself,even though it's a pipe-dream.  \\"Empire (Let Them Sing)\\" is the conflict/resolution of its predecessor.  The song builds to a massive isolated moment, then all instruments drop out to emphasize the \\"LET THEM SING LET THEM SING.\\"  Oli again, using wolves to push theme as well as a possible illusion to The Wizard of Oz (...\\"you live like a house in a hurricane.\\")  \\"Sleepwalking\\" is a melodic powerhouse with one of the most demanding choruses I've heard in recent memory.  You can actually envision an entire theatre of people screaming \\"It's like I'm Sleepwalking.\\"  \\"Go to Hell For Heaven's Sake\\" is unreal.  The sick, desperate, chorus is jarring.  The climactic ending of \\"GTHFHS\\" has Oli repeating the title, then completely drops out to \\"Shadow Moses.\\"  The intro offers a pleasant tempo shift, before thrusting back into the fray.  What is even more dissonant is the ambient outro transitioning into one, if not the BEST song, I've ever heard - \\"And the Snakes Start To Sing.\\"  Cued by Jordan's keys, the emotions run rampant.  This song is akin to Deftones' work.  The tempo shifts, the harmonies kick in, the drums pulsating, and then - \\"Ive lost apart of me...\\" and \\"Worms come out of the Woodwork...\\"  This eerie, perverse narrative should remind the entire genre to reconsider the infrastructure of their songs.  The pace builds, all instruments drop out, Oli's spoken word hits, then bass pumps, \\"If you can't soar with the eagles, Then don't fly with the flock...\\" Then sheering vocals, pulsating instruments, and a climactic rhythm end the song.  \\"Seen it All Before\\" picks up pace including a massive ending, while \\"Anti-vist\\" drives the anthemic attributes home.  \\"Crooked Young\\" offers the last fast-paced song and serves as an appropriate bridge before we are capsized.  \\"Hospital of Souls\\" is similar to \\"ATSSTS.\\"  Here the live orchestra are in the forefront.  Oli's confronts his inner turmoil, absolving his fears in spoken word.  The gravity of this song finishes the story arc as well as resolves the tone.  There isn't one person who doesn't throw their fist 5 times, stomp their feet, and lift their hands in the air when Oli says \\"THROW ME TO THE FLAMES!\\"  The sheer enunciation of words causes the hair on the back of my neck to stand up.  I almost tear up to this song its so jarring.  Especially near the end when Oli's dissonant/ambient \\"Hold me close don't let go,\\" hits.  What most are missing, at the final climax of the record this song cuts out.  \\"Hold me close dont let go, in this hospital for SO...\\"  Which to us fans, Oli's journey went unfinished.  Something IS left.  It was an inevitable deterioration.  The subtle cut out makes us go \\"Wait what!?\\"  We are left exasperated, but also in a cliffhanger.  We aren't sure if all is resolved.<br /><br />For those of you who made it through my entire review, I commend you.  This album is too important for some review to be a paragraph (cough Revolver, Metal Hammer, Rocksound).  It's their job to fit it in a small uniform space.  It's my free time to me to cover as much ground as needed.  Sempiternal houses the content we've been missing.  The album is almost to raw.  At no time am I passive listening to it.  Even the bonus tracks are substantial.  They are poignant in and of themselves.  Sempiternal IS the definitive \\"SOUND\\" (not metalcore/music) experience.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Tongue in cheek aside, the first couple episodes are introducing you the characters and laying out the storyline. Its not all action...its the beginning of a story.<br /><br />Always cracks me up when folks leave comments like \\"watched one episode and bailed\\".<br /><br />If I would have watched one episode of Battlestar Galactica, Lost, Walking Dead, Borgias, Sons of Anarchy....or even Game of Thrones....I would have been BORED out of my mind. (Well maybe not with GOT, as I read all the books feverishly)<br /><br />Why? Because this is old fashioned story telling, folks. Good stories are told slowly and TV just got good.<br /><br />Remember when Grandpa set by the campfire and told you that story thats forever ingrained your memory?  One that you tell your kids, and your kids will tell theirs. Well, thats what its all about.<br /><br />And its about time we got some quality for our time invested.<br /><br />You want \\"one outs\\"? Shows you can pick up at any given time, any given year.....digress back to the 80's, or even the 90's. Its full of \\"one outs\\" where your not invested in the story line and characters. Thats not entertainment.<br /><br />But this series...IS! Fantastic. Beautiful to look at, and wonderful to see unfold.<br /><br />So...sit back, relax.....and let someone tell you a story.  \\"Hurry up already\\" is for work, not home. :D
1933952806|5.0|Darrell Young's book should be on everyone's personal library.  If you want to learn all the great functions of the D-7000 than this is the book for you.  Young has a way of explaining the camera's function in an easy to follow format and at the end of the chapter he ends it with his own recommendation.

B000W746GK|5.0|I want to buy this product but want to know if this in Spanish because I am from another country<br /><br />thanks
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|As another reviewer mentioned I think only around 10% of his cases would hold up in today's courts but if you are a Columbo fan this is the ultimate fix.  The picture quality is great and the sheer pleasure of watching uncut and uninterrupted shows is worth it.  You will know when the commercials should be coming up and they don't -  fantastic.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I had never heard of this book before beginning to read it on my Kindle. I loved the lessons contained within it. The earth, air and nature are healing. Pushing negative thoughts from your head makes room for good thoughts. People can change and improve themselves. I recommend reading this book if you need some uplifting, some hope.
1451695195|5.0|I've read a few of this type of book, but this by far is the best! I just ordered the hardcover for my Son's 49th birthday.<br />I recommend it highly.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|In order to play a game it has to work. This game has perfect graphics, perfect plot, perfect everything. So why only 2 stars? The request Timed out crap. It stops working and I ended up taking game off of fire,, and reinstalling each time this happened. This happened everyday. Please fix this.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am currently in a Photography class and needed something to carry my extra lenses and other camera gear. I was very happy that this backpack was not too big, but was roomy enough for my gear. The compartments can be adjusted because they are attached with velcro. There is enough room to carry my keys and ID. So, I only carry this and my tripod when I go out for class assignments. It was a great value and very functional.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|This album is awesome..has an indie/dark feel to it but it sucks you in and makes you want to continue to listen.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Great insight to Gregory Peck, his family, and his film history in addition to so many enhanced &#34;Mockingbird&#34; moments.  The film has been a major essential for years, and I bought the 50th Anniversary Set to allow my grandson to view it with us.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm always hesitant when I buy books on kindle. While the ease of self-publishing is a great way for new authors to get their works out to the public, it has the unfortunate downside of saturating the market with books that are poorly edited.<br /><br />With this book (or collection of books I guess you'd call it), I bought the full book before I even finished the sample. It was that good. The characters are well presented and believable, the story is compelling, and the book surprised me with many of the turns the plot took. I'm greatly looking forward to buying and reading the rest of the series.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow does it again. She seems able to put one right in the middle of the event - something I find hard to describe. For me, a film has to have an effect on the audience. Both &#34;Hurt Locker&#34; and &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; made me very uncomfortable - as uncomfortable as the characters in the story, and that is a brilliant effect. I loved this movie.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Actually, it's a far more thrilling and engaging movie than the original.  If you like action and non-stop paced movies, then you will enjoy this a great deal.
159420411X|4.0|The book is brand new, but was missing the cover sheet. Very good deal and worth the money! I would recommend this item to others. It came in two days even with regular shipping prices. I am very happy with my purchase!
0374275637|4.0|The book is in very good condition and came quickly. I wish it had the cover on it still, but am able to read it just the same without it. I would recommend this item to others.
0670026603|4.0|First of all, I would like to address some reviewers' issue with the ending of this book. From what I can tell most of the Amazon reviewers who gave this novel a low rating did so because they thought the ending was \\"depressing\\", \\"pessimistic\\", \\"sends the wrong message about paralysis\\", \\"insulting to people with disabilities\\", etc. Basically, they were disappointed the characters didn't get the happily-ever-after they thought was less controversial and more deserved, and that's completely fine but a little beside the point....<br /><br />This novel demonstrates and reinforces freedom of choice. An Amazon reviewer said she hoped her disabled niece never read this book. I can't put myself in a disabled person's place, but I know that, as with many other things in life, some individuals have a harder time with their handicaps than others. Almost 2 years ago, my father collapsed with cardiac arrhythmia. They revived his heart, but he never regained consciousness due to brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation after his collapse. At one point, we were told we should start considering his options, keeping in mind that whatever decision we came to it should be driven by what he would want, not what we wanted. I connected with Will on a level because he felt the way I know my father would have: that to be brought back as anything less than what he'd been was unthinkable. I'm not saying that death is the only answer. What I'm saying, and what I think Moyes is saying, is that people need to live their lives on their terms in accordance with what feels right for them. In fact, that's the title of the book, right there: Me Before You.<br /><br />But this somber destination, which drives the rest of the book, takes a backseat to the actual journey. The real heart of this novel is about living a full life, a good life, the life that the individual always wanted. Some readers clearly got sidelined by an ending they couldn't understand or agree with, and that's fine although unfortunate for them. This book is about how a broken man, who has lived a fulfilling life, inspires a directionless woman to live to her potential. Had Will changed his mind in the end, then this book would have been something entirely different. It would have been about how to fall in love/date/live with a quadriplegic, and if Will and Lou had ended up together as a couple no one would have been satisfied with some quick epilogue about how their life is so perfect now that love saved everything. Because that's the thing about life; it's not always perfect or fair or salvageable. We are told that love saves anything and anyone. It's drilled into us repeatedly by various mediums, usually of the artistic persuasion. But life, often, isn't really like that. Love isn't always enough, love doesn't always fix the problem. That's not to say don't try. That's to say try and if it doesn't work, be OK knowing you did everything you could and accept that freedom of choice exists for every single human being.<br /><br />One thing about the ending I will criticize is the fact that only after Will bequeaths x amount of money to Lou does she actually start her life. I'm not sure how I feel about this solution...If we could all be so lucky, right? That's a little too Hollywood for me. I also wasn't a fan of the random narrative transition. Lou is the narrator for the majority of the book and then four other supporting characters take over the narrative for one chapter's length at various times. It was odd and didn't serve a purpose; I'd rather have been inside Will's head for a chapter if Moyes was going to go that route.<br /><br />P.S. If you want a good theme song to this book, listen to I Remember by Yeasayer. If they ever made a film of this book, I would expect this song to be in it somewhere.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Great season, love Doctor Who! There was some trouble with loading at random times, but otherwise worked good and great show!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series.  Shows the interaction between the social classes in the early 1900s.  Great character portrayals from all the actors.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|Read this book for our book club and many of us felt the same about the book - I wanted to &#34;like&#34; the 'heroine' but could not muster up any empathy for her in spite of her being enslaved. I hope the cruelty was over-played but I am not confident it was. A sad sad story overall.
0525953728|5.0|I thought the story was very well done. It was as close to being there as you could get from the comfort of your home.
B004MPRX0O|5.0|I have read about 4 of these novels in the Jack Reacher series and this was a very good one.  Great edge of your seat action.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Amazing book.  I haven't had one capture my imagination like this in a long time.  The details were amazing, the story was believable, and the humor of the writing wonderful.  I look forward to whatever Andy Weir writes next.
B006VREHRS|5.0|I love Boardwalk Empire! Many times the first episode of a season is not that great because it's trying to set you up to get to know the characters and what is the just of the show.  Boardwalk Empire has me all in from the beginning.  This is a show for people who like shows about some bad boys, who like some to some of the knowledge of the past with some great entertainment mixed together. I highly suggest this to everyone to give this a try!  Love it!!!!

B003204MQS|1.0|Watched this movie upon a recommendation. I can only say that if, when you were about ten years old you loved to sit around and share spooky stories with your mates, then this movie is for you. Be prepared for bad acting, silly special effects and a weak story.
0553573403|4.0|I bought this book not too long a ago, so far have beening reading like crazy. Wonderful epic fantasy and look forward to reading on. But I was dissapointed at the condition of the book, being advertised as gently used was a little misleading. The book came with creases and bends in corners and the spine was a little worse for wear. Its ok though, I consider this a read only copy and plan on buying a nicer box set later on. Overall ok, great book; so so conditon.

B005NPCUC8|5.0|This album is the perfect mixture of artistic innovation, musical virtuosism, talent in composition and technical exploration. Sure, recording techniques have progressed in all this years, but the combination of genius, dedication, and a solid background this album boasts is simply unbeatable.<br />This is something you have to listen to carefully.
0525457585|4.0|The Neverending Story is a great book about a young boy that goes on an incredible journey.  In the course of the journey he loses his identity and must learn to love who he is in order to get back home.  An inspiring read.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|One of the better movies I've seen in a while.  Had me laughing out loud at times (saw it by myself).  Beautiful story that was translated excellently into a movie.  A must see.  Don't even notice the subtitles because you get pulled into and engrossed by the story.  Easy 5 star rating.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|There are things which are a real pain in the neck for me. Installing the heatsink on my CPU is one. Once it is installed, I do not want to have to return to it. I really do not want to return to it for a few bucks, which is what this thermal compound paste cost.<br />For the size, the price is high. Compared to the price of a CPU, it is very cheap.<br />So when I build a new computer, I go straight for the best: Arctic Silver.<br />I have been using this brand for many years and my computers, although monsters are always in the cool range.<br />The actual one idles at about 35C. It will indeed have a lot to do with the heatsink...

B0091CWYQ6|2.0|I reviewed the black version and gave it five stars.<br />The silver is indeed identical and at the same price.<br />I am now on my 4th one since I returned the one I am actually reviewing, to order two more.<br />I returned it because that item must have missed the Quality Control. The  headphone jacks were very difficult to insert and the jack of the unit undid itself. I could have glued it and kept it but I decided to use Amazon's amazing return options.<br />The two silver ones I received both are showing the same kind of resistance inserting the headphone jacks. I did not have that issue with the black one.<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars because for its purpose, the item is excellent.<br />If like me you are using your Iphone to listen to music on a daily basis and like to use quality headphones, then this is for you!<br />It comes as a very nice replacement for the cheap and easily broken units in the market. If you were to look at my Amazon reviews, you could see that I have reviewed more than my share of them and they all eventually break.<br /><br />So what's to like?<br /><br />- It works as a remote for music and chats. It has full functionality.<br />- It provides with about 8 hours of Power boost, claiming to support up to 300 Ohms.<br />- It offers also a bass boost (which I am not using)<br />- It is small and affordable.<br />- A bypass allows to use the unit when it has run out of battery.<br /><br />What's not to like?<br />Not sure yet...<br /><br />A must buy!<br /><br />Edit 10/18/13<br />Here is the update:<br />I still think this headphone as a remote is still the best out there for its purpose.<br />However, the quality is definitely an issue. It must be the 4th or 5th I have decided to return because of a short at the jack just after a few weeks of daily use. The short is not so much felt while listening to music but you cans still hear statics. The worst part is that it will disconnect call, start music or forward on its own, start the voice command. The quality is not acceptable at this stage.<br />For a while I thought it was only with the silver version but no, the black one is failing too...<br />Too bad because conceptually, it is still a very good item.voice command. The quality is not acceptable at this stage.<br />For a while I thought it was only with the silver version but no, the black one is failing too...<br />Too bad because conceptually, it is still a very good item.
B008D36INE|3.0|Slow and predictable, depressing. But I had nothing better to do so my time was not wasted. I thought the acting was very good although the characters left me somewhat unmoved.
B0044IABFS|5.0|Surprise ending! I think the ending was very good and I was happy with it. I miss this show already!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Cant load Only have the first book. I tried all day and overnight the Bible would not load. Can u fix it.

B0081336FO|5.0|My daughter is a fan of Sherlock Holmes and convinced us to watch this and the whole family loved it! Can't wait for season 3!
B008CP93S0|5.0|This movie is a riot,i have'nt laughed this much in years..great cast,moves fast.Reminds me of the town i live in.
8866137634|5.0|Uma maneira fácil e rápida de organizar a vida. Junto com o EVERNOTE o caderno Moleskine é de grande utilidade.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I don't like it because all you do is walk around and put blocks down its stupid and if you ask me you shouldn't buy its just a waist of money
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A really entertaining movie. Political action funny and has that 70s grit. My only comment is I wish it didn't have Ben Affleck. I just can't take that guy seriously
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book has shown so many insights into the psyche of a working women that are just inbuilt in us since childhood. It's a must read for ever women out there.
B007MDQW3C|5.0|The album arrived quickly, and to my relief, not bent up!<br />The vinyl is red, nice surprise!<br />This is my favorite album of hers. So sweet and upbeat! Definitely buy it!
B004USLWVE|5.0|Great camera bag all the way around, the option of going back pack or sling' is very practical !!! Go 4 it !
B0074YVW1G|4.0|It is an interesting book as there are not many books on this subject but it needs  A LOT more work.  The book repeats itself many times over even using the same examples.  It feels like the book is actually over about half way into it and then it just keeps taking space and time.  One could easily condense it into a third of its volume.
B0091REZMW|5.0|The first night I played this game I was addicted; played 8 hours straight. If you enjoy hidden object games; this is the one to play.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Who doesn't love the story of Dorothy & her three companions? Every character is rich in personality & very unique. I also loved all of the little social commentary made by the characters.<br />A great read for any age.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I like this book because it id about a kid who dose something that he doesn't want to do.i also like this book because it shows jest because there is something wrong with you doesn't mean that you cant do amazing things.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|After having worn this watch for about a week, I have noticed that it gains less than 15 seconds per day, which is pretty good for an automatic out of the box.  The watch feels durable so far and I do like the nylon strap so far.  It doesn't fit with a suit and tie, but with slacks and an odd jacket it feels appropriate to me, if not a bit on the casual side of the spectrum.<br /><br />I like the smaller size.  My wrists are normal size for a 6'00\\" man and the size is just right to me.  It doesn't follow the huge watch fad, but who cares?<br /><br />TIP:  If you want to set the second hand to a precise time, just press up on the crown while very slowly twisting it counterclockwise.  After several seconds the second hand will stop or turn backwards.  You can set the second hand by timing the release, then set the time as usual by twisting the crown.
0385349831|5.0|MANUSCRIPT FOUND IN ACCRA is written with clarity, wisdom and in a condensed, beautiful voice. I love the Gnostic gospel-like voice of the Copte. I think that Paulo's strength in creating the \\"Sage\\" character (as he also did so masterfully in THE ALCHEMIST, both as a character and a \\"philosopical\\" narrator) is equally beautifully done in THE MANUSCRIPT FOUND IN ACCRA. I also love when Paulo uses the literary landscape of the \\"Middle East\\", that mythic blend of Arabian Nights, Biblical, Middle Eastern/North African landscape he does so well.<br /><br />I wish and hope Paulo Coelho will continue to offer us more gifts from the same rich part of him that has given us THE ALCHEMIST and THE MANUSCRIPT FOUND IN ACCRA.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|With apologies to the fans of the other incarnation, this Stargate was the best. Every episode had focus and the intensity that kept me on the edge of my seat.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Very good remake of the older movie.  Good acting and satisfactory special effects.  I give it a thumbs up on this one.
B009LUCPWQ|4.0|Like they never left.  Favorites include Three Chords Good, Stop Cryin About the Rain, She Rocks Me, Arlingtons Busy, Last Bookstore in Town.
B001B6PBBK|4.0|I gave it 4 stars and not 5 due to it not being mind-gripping and completely enthralling. Otherwise it's a good chick flick to pass the time.
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|favorite songs include Sex Drugs and Violence, 99 Revolutions, The Forgotten.  This album has everything from ballads to rock to punk.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|It's entertaining but not really exciting.<br />I feel Timberlake is the worst thing in the movie.<br />She is good and sweet.
B002S0OBMS|3.0|The album was ok, not as good as others under the Weber label.  I was not disappointed in service, but just my expectations.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This is one of the better movies I have seen lately. It was on cable, we liked it so much I purchased it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is unbelievably talented.  Different songs with different styles. Wish he'd use the word &#34;love&#34; in place of sex-then my 11 yr old granddaughter could enjoy the album, too.
B00785P2QC|4.0|could be worse a lttle frustraiting but pkayable especially since it is free. played worse played better. need improvement on moveability into new spaces
B0076UXKDG|1.0|I bought this thing so I could move focus cursor easier while in portrait orientation. However the cheap plastic directional pad on the battery grip is not the same as on the back of the D800. Its too small and often clicks in so that my cursor gets reset rather than moving in the direction I actually want. Its so bad that I prefer to use the directional pad on the back of the camera with \\"the flying right elbow\\" rather than deal with this piece of crap!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Actors are perfectly cast; the amount of detail in the set design is impressive.<br />It's fun to see Sherlock in a modern setting & solving crimes utilizing current technology mixed<br />with keen intuition & photographic memory.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|HBO did a great job on this show, not sure why I waited so long to watch it. Can't wait to get started on season 2
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|it is okay but some of the levels are quite hard since you are on a tablet and NOT a compter
1935251740|3.0|It's an interesting theory, but it's full of flaws. Worth to read, but don't take it too seriously if you ask me.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fantastic wee game try it boy or girl man or woman you will love this game quick free n cheerful x
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun. Love card and word games. Keeps me coming back to play. Teaching my partener to play; he's not so into card games.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really wish there was a sequel to this book. Couldn't put it down!!!!! You will find yourself getting wrapped up in the writers words!!!
B008XG1X18|2.0|Can not figure this out; I sign in and nothing happens. Could use some help if it's out there. Help!!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Perfect. beautiful, horrible, thoughtful, moving, entertaining, educational, and very scary...  we have come so far and we have only crawled.
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|Fair movie; interesting, but not an award candidate. Lucy diserves better material. Maybe it is just that it is a man's movie; all action,blood & guts. Not much of a story line.
B001EC2IV2|4.0|You know ol Aronald just won't get beaten.  Good enough to keep me going.  This was the second time I've seen it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Seldom does a book move me to tears, but this one really hit the  mark. Great character development. I recomend it highly,
B007V65R54|5.0|Fascinating account of what we can predict, what we can't and why. Who knew that weather forecasting was one of the successes!
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Sold by: B68 Solutions Limited<br /><br />Just horrible! I saw thought the plastic wrapping on the left hand side there was a crack. Couldn't get a replacement shipped from Amazon; instead got a refund of $2.00. However, the worse was yet to come! I opened the CD case and out fell the CD onto my lap. Why? Because the part which holds the CD in place, that circular centre thing was half gone!
0446579939|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it yet another time. As with all his books, I really enjoyed reading this book.<br />Great reading for anyone.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Daniel Craig continues to play a very human, and thus more exciting Bond.  None of the others (great in their own rights) had the &#34;this could be me&#34; feel Craig brings to the role.  I thought this was an excellent movie.
1606863622|1.0|I received this book after ordering a hard cover. This is a hard cover, but the size of a paper back book. I returned it.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|As a rule, I'm not really into horse racing or tales about race horses, but this was well done.  I rather enjoyed Diane Lane's role growth in the story more.  A good movie and worth seeing.
0131480057|5.0|This book is annoyingly thorough.<br /><br />You will not likely be helped if you are trying to drill down into a specific product but it will definitely give you an exhaustive general knowledge of UNIX and Linux administration.<br /><br />Everyone who does UNIX and/or Linux administration should have this as a reference on their desk.
B0047VSW30|4.0|This is a good historical drama and an excellent presentation of zealotry gone wrong.  The acting was excellent and the presentation was great.  So far as the product itself goes, The DVD was delivered promptly, well packaged, and in excellent condition.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|I read all these books in the print form years ago. I do enjoy reading them again. It is like visiting old friends. While reading; I'm sitting, with Evie, Annabelle, Lilian and Daisy, my dear friends eating good food  and hearing old stories again and again.
6304806418|4.0|This is not a film for people who don't like musicals, Madonna, or Bandares.  Having said that, it is a good flick and worth watching.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I get it, they have marital problems.  Turning 40 sucks.  Cool.  They are just miserable the whole time over nothing.  The brief funny moments are not enough to detract from the feeling that &#34;oh no, mom and dad might be getting a divorce&#34;.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|This is a catching series.  I remembered the old movie with Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis and thought this was a remake at first, but not so.  Hannah is great in the lead and it's a shame cancer took him away from the role.  Most folks would probably find it a little rough from the sex part, but I think the story is well told.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|A very good movie, even from someone like me who isnt a huge animated movie person.  That said, I wouldnt say this is anywhere near as good as the rest of the Pixar lineup.
6304712936|5.0|This movie deserved the Oscars it won.  What a great portrayal of genius mixing with insanity.  This is a must see, even if you don't like classical music.
B00BHMF578|3.0|How did this win an Oscar?  Was it a good movie? Yes...but certainly not an Oscar winning movie.  As a bit of a history buff as well, I can tell you it is highly factually inaccurate, and paints a very dim picture of the countries outside of the US who did so much to help our embassy employees.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Upgraded an older computer and couldn't be happier.  This processor really has made my old computer new again.  Great product!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Loved the book and the movie was wonderful. Great countryside scenes! Very easy to get caught up in the adventure and walk down the path. Leaves you wanting more!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every week there's new tension....either between the characters, or fending off zombies. I never imagined being drawn to a zombie show, but I was hooked from the first episode. Great characters, challenges  and surprises. Where will the next season take us?
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|\\"The Sons of Anarchy\\" is one of the best shows on TV today, and its' great to be able to get it through streaming video on Amazon.com  My husband and I really enjoy watching it together--we get a real kick out of it--as we know some crazy motorcycle enthusiasts who grew up in the 60's like we did.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I really don't like to watch people being brain washed. The poor guy was struggling so much, and just wanted to find answers in life. They frustrated him to the point of exhaustion and violence. It just left me feeling bad.
B000FC12SM|2.0|I don't like how he makes reference to the men and women in this book, Venusians are women. What!?! I had to just keep reading the book and saying &#34;women&#34; over the word Venusian. It was rather annoying so I stopped reading the book. And its horribly repetitive. Not a good read. Buy ANY Dr. Laura book and you will save your sanity and relationship. Promise!
B001NLL93W|5.0|This had to be one of my favorites. I haven't read the last two remaining books yet but I can say that with each book, the series just keeps better and better!!
B0067R0APK|1.0|I have to say that most of the apps Amazon is offering are the worst.  They are cheap, don't really offer much and are useless.
B000P0J024|3.0|The songs I knew I like, some of the others were OK.Others I didn't like at all. I guess I'll try again.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What a great classic to get for free. I am going to enjoy reading this great classic for years to come.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|keep running the battery down playing this. Curious to see what happens when I get the village built. On level 66 most levels are pretty easy then they throw a difficult one at ya. Some take a few tries and take more focus. So glad I bought it days of fun for $1.99!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Totally recommend free classic Kindle books, especially this one because it is one of my favorites and it was free!!!
B001RONJYC|5.0|I bought this movie simply because i could watch it over n over.In my opinion it is the best historical tale of the beggining of a music empire.The cast was terrific.Adiren brody's best acting ,and beyonce's best singing,as good if not better then the original.yours truly....babylonbruce
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Another favorite classic book that I will enjoy reading again and again. Totally recommend and once again free free free!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I could not put the Kindle down - Loved it as much or more than season one - nearly as much as season three
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the maps and all the info I need when I'm traveling or just need to know the weather for the day or a week.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez has a better voice than Dylan's, lyrics that one can HEAR, finally, and the message(s) are still timely!<br />We watched the documentary: &#34;Looking for Sugarman&#34;, and promptly bought both his albums!<br />What in the #$% was Motown doing to promote him way back when...?  I guess not much...<br /><br />He's a star, should have been on the scene 40 years ago, but now he's back, and we're seeing him at the Orpheum in L.A. this month.<br /><br />Bravo, Rodriguez...you &#34;walk your talk&#34;!!<br />Susan Lovell McLaughlin and John McLaughlin
B00632HWOG|5.0|Would highly recommend to anyone who has yahoo for their email because it's very quick and easy plus free is always good.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|We've reviewed Coming from Reality...feel the same about Cold Fact...just a shame this singer/songwriter was given the promotion he deserved way back when...<br /><br />We are his FANS!  Bought his albums, plus another to give away!<br /><br />Susan Lovell McLaughlin and John McLaughlin
B005X5XIL0|5.0|Andrea never disappoints.......he is so far above everyone else in this category......Can't wait for &#34;Love in Portafino: to come out.<br />He is so humble & talented.......we now have over 6 cds, but this was our 1st dvd.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  SPOILER: EVERYBODY DIES HORRIBLY. There is absolutely nothing positive in the movie.  Survivor spirit?  No, wolf meat.<br /><br />Run away from this horrible movie.  Hopeless POS...
B000VROBQQ|5.0|Two talented musicians making incredible music together. If you like Pat Metheny you'll enjoy this music. I would recommend this album.
B0061S073A|3.0|I was really excited about this app for my Kindle Fire, because I have three kids and its the family tablet. However, it restricts usage of Kindle Free Time. The kids aren't permitted to access any content.
0385349831|5.0|I am very enthusiastic about MANUSCRIPT FOUND IN ACCRA. Paulo Coelho has written a very wise book with unquestionable urgency and relevance for the times in which we're living globally. It is a text that will last for a long, long time. Every reader will find something between the lines that seems to be a message, just for him or her.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I like the game it's cool but I want my 10 lives for signing into FB but can't KINDLE FIRE HD fix please!
0525953728|5.0|I received the book before I was told I would receive it. It was packaged securely. The price was in the range I hoped I thought I would pay.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|If you are looking for hours of gameplay this game is for you and it is a great game to play against people
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the brilliant HD picture for my Pinterest app. It makes me happy. I would recommend it to everyone.
B009K2SLYG|5.0|......gruesome with big pointy teeth!!  It was so fun to see this again after many years and enjoy it with my kids.  It is a timeless classic that never gets boring.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|Fun and cool college  Comedy with plenty of laughs. If you like American Pie you'll like this one too. .
B009JZOOKO|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a loooooooong time. I recommend every1 should see it & own it!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am an appliance repairman and I carry my Kindle with the case in my tool bag and so far (3 weeks) it has been fine
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is seriously focused on the day to day work of horse carriers, what they have to go through and the money and energy the need to make everything possible.
B0096BIENY|5.0|love their music. i appreciate the blend of the classical with the pop. their voices are amazing. recommend it highly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought, \\"Do I really want to read a romance book about a seventeen- year-old?\\"  But this is more than a romance. It is about seventeen- year-olds with mature thoughts and actions.  You will go through all the same emotions that are told....and you will love this book.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|The wires broke at the control box and the headset quit working about 4mo after buying it,I'm very careful with my equipment too so it's not from misuse or abuse,I bought the Sony wireless ps3 headphones and those are great,spend a little more,you'll be glad you did
B005LAII62|4.0|Decent writing.  Decent art.  Not as good pacing...ie direction.  But worth seeing more'n once.  So buy it if you like it..NOT scary unless you are like 4 years old.
B001GXNBJW|5.0|Rocking album with the gritty, heavy guitar sounds that the Black Keys fans love.  After only knowing their more recent works, I am very happy I went with Rubber Factory and The Big Come Up as my first 'other' Black Keys albums.  They both rock.
B0000004UB|3.0|I bought this CD because Samantha Fox was doing an autograph signing and I needed something for her to sign.  She is short and sweet in real life.  As for the music on the CD, it's okay.  I like the hits \\"I Surrender\\" and \\"Naughty Girls\\"; and also \\"If Music Be the Food of Love\\" for the Shakespearean connection.  The rest of the music doesn't do much for me, although I don't hate it.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|It is always a treat becoming a fan of an established band with a large catalog of albums.  All of my Black Keys experiences have been great.  Many of the albums have a distinct feel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best book I've read in years. Equivalent to first time you read Enders Game. Incredible story that will make a great film when they do it.
B003LXSY60|5.0|The Black Keys rock again.  Great album with stellar guitar and drum work.  Love listening to these guys.  Very happy this album opened me up to the world of the Black Keys.  They have a number of other great albums.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I finally watched Sherlock, and I am hooked. From the first episode, I am a big fan. The first story is so well done, characters are written perfectly, acting is superb, and the way they illustrate the way Sherlock's mind works with superimposed text is a stroke of genious. The first episode is written by Stephen Moffet, so fans of Doctor Who can relate to the quality and depth of the story telling. Masterfully done on all levels. Not a bad episode in either season (Series)
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The Black Keys rock again.  Great album with stellar guitar and drum work.  Love listening to these guys.  If the new stuff is all you know, take a look back at Rubber Factory and the Big Come Up (frankly any of their albums).  they rock just as hard.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a great book. I really enjoyed the different points of view. Very suspenseful and it kept me interested. It was a good book from page one.
B001661RC2|4.0|This album came across as much slower and more mellow than I was anticipating from the other releases I have sampled from the black keys. All of their albums have pretty distinct feels but to my untrained ear this was the biggest departure from what I was expecting.  Maybe I am just never paying attention at the right time while its playing.  Still a good listen for sure.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|it's amazing and full of advancers an alternate world is just beyond the magical mirror and a dark sranger that appears and disappears it a cool game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't want to stop reading after I started, but at 1 am I thought I better try to sleep. The next evening I finished and what a great book. I looked forward to what was going to be revealed page after page.
B001I45UFC|5.0|A must read for all ages, the classic adventure of four children who discover a magical land within a wardrobe.  The kindle edition is beautiful, and a steal of a price.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Bought this book because it was chosen for our book club. It was the first time I have finished a book club book. The story brings you into the emotions felt by both of the main characters. Truly an emotional, amazing story!
B003B02OOG|5.0|Great book, enjoyed it immensely. Easy to read, meet interesting but some not so nice characters, follow their exploits and adventures.
B0007939NO|5.0|i do not like musicals but this is the exception. a true love story for the ages.one of my favorites of all time.
B0054VVRBQ|1.0|I liked the fact that when in use both the memory card and the reader itself were flush with the side of my laptop -- as far as I could find this is the only reader to have this feature.  Unfortunately, the card reader stopped reading memory cards after one (1) week of use.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Enjoying this download.<br />Bruno is enjoying untold success with this and many other albums.<br />A good deal for adoring fans everywhere.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this product when they had a huge sale (flash deal) on it. It was 3 books for less then $6! With free shipping too! I bought it as a gift and it shipped to my house in about 2-3 days!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game above all expectations! Graphics are incredible never blurred. Going up the levels keeps you entertained and the competitions are fun. There is a big choice of tack and horse accessories and the option of buying other breeds of horses too. Must download
B000001G1E|1.0|I ordered this four disc set. I only recieved one of the four discs. When I tried to return or replace the item to Amazon, they did not give me that option. I am now stuck with a very expensive used single disc.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Well written and nicely played Merissa Torme like always is a natural at being in the moment. Matthew McConaughey is in rare form very nice to see.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game itself is fun. The ads after every hand are definitely irritating, but it's free. There has to be some give-and-take on an otherwise decent free app. These ads are hardly invasive or virus-like as some have claim.<br /><br />It's Solitaire. Download it and enjoy.
B005H9B44A|3.0|I enjoyed the show and loved the story. As a fan of Thor when I was a kid it kept the Marvel tradition Thor I felt could have had a bit more substance being agressive is just the beginning. Natalie Portman was lovely and I cant stop watching her.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|I liked it, but it seemed odd, kind of like the the writer got inspiration from the Bible.The way it ends and everything that happens in the movie, didn't seem to be focused on the love story, but the way they act is just similar to some Bible stories. It's still a good movie.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Wall-E is one of our family's favorite movies.. Our old DVD got scratched up. Looking for a new copy, we decided to go the extra mile and get the special edition package. It has a lot of bonus clips, interviews, and extra shorts. It was a good value for the money.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Didn't expect it to be good, but it is! It's not all action like a Bourne movie, it's got a good mix, and the love part of the story is more of on the side, so it doesn't force itself into the movie. Good action, and entertainment. Not all in your face action like Bourne movies!
086571701X|5.0|we got turned onto aquaponics as a way to be more self reliant, we got this book to help us set up our system. It has helped us with every step in the process, we currently have set up our first grow bed and are working out the kinks. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in aquaponics, easy to read and understand. Great reference book to keep on hand!
0634049011|5.0|This book is no frills.  its a very practical guide for learning the guitar fretboard.  Though its only 80+ pages, its packed tightly with material.<br /><br />Well worth the price.  I would recommend getting this book in combination with Guitar Theory by Tom Kolb.  Both combined give players an incredible familiarity with the fretboard.<br /><br />Guitar Fretboard Workbook is practical while Guitar Theory (book) is theory.  Both combined help me familiarize myself with the guitar.  I was frustrated for years about learning this and now I am not.  VERY, VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought this was an excellent book. I can't wait to get the rest. If you like doomsday type stories, I would recommend this one.

0714834491|5.0|I purchased this book for my niece as a college graduation present. She's graduating from University of Cincinnati's 5-year graphic design program and I wanted to give her a special coffee-table book that she could really enjoy. She's the fifth generation in our family to pursue a career in the industry - she's a font junkie, and a gifted photographer, digital designer, and &#34;traditional&#34; graphic designer, too (and I'm not just saying she's gifted because I'm her aunt!)<br /><br />This book does not disappoint. The day it was delivered, I couldn't wait to page through it to view the content - and I couldn't put it down! My husband finally took it away from me so I didn't break the spine before giving it as a gift.<br /><br />If you're in the graphics industry, this book is for you. The essays are great - humorous, serious, and thought-provoking - and the graphics are beautiful. Each of the over 500 2-page spreads focuses on a different idea, and the title couldn't be more appropriate. It makes you think about the many ways you can (and should) look at everything you see - from print collateral to webpages to people - and life!<br /><br />This one's a keeper. I gave it to my niece early because it's big and heavy - not something to cart to a graduation dinner - she LOVED it!<br /><br />I'm ordering a second copy for me, and will definitely consider this as a gift again not just for students in the graphics industry, but for graduates in any discipline - it's a fun read and a visual delight.
B000I8G5NA|3.0|not as good as the first MIB but not as bad as the 3rd. It's about what you'd expect from a sequel of a great movie.
B0058YPGVQ|2.0|The actual tv series was excellent but disc 2 of the 3 disc set did not work.  It kept coming up disc error on the blu ray player (which is brand new)  I had my daughter try it on hers and it did not work there.  I did not get to watch the whole series

1439153663|1.0|The premise of this story is fascinating and based on the great reviews, I picked up this book. I tried and tried to like it, but I just couldn't get into it. One reviewer said this was similar to a 12-year-old's reading level. I  felt similarly, like I was reading a children's book. I found it uninteresting and I thought the rotation of the narrative didn't work well. Also, I had difficult really 'believing' the black slave narratives; it just didn't 'sound' authentic. Kathryn Stockett, author of The Help, did a remarkable job at the black women's voices and her rotation of the points of view also worked. I only read about half of The Kitchen House as I just could not subject myself any further. I don't understand how this was a page-turner for many readers. I am a voracious reader of many terrific novels, but I just could not find the inclination to continue reading this.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|This movie wasn't really very attention getting. My 7 yr old got bored and we didn't even finish watching it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to read this book. I first saw the movie on Masterpiece Classics and then I was hooked, I had to read the book. I loved how dark the main characters became especially for the time period where everyone was expected to conduct themselves in a certain way...great read

B00B49L7JY|5.0|Any music fan, or simply a fan of well crafted documentary, will enjoy this film.  The almost unbelievable story of mystery man Rodriguez is compelling from start to finish.  My only disappointment is that the film wasn't made sooner!  It's a crime that it took 30 plus years for this mans music to be heard by an American audience.

EXCELLENT for children interested in strategy games!!

B008PZYZH6|4.0|Good action, adventure, story, and thrilling.  It has moments of serious drama and funny moments as well.  It's a good movie to watch at least one time.
1609611543|5.0|Good book, with lots of information. I like the new book better, but both are great compliments to each other.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Just looking to add my rating without a lot of commentary. But from the start, everything seemed wrong. The CGI is clearly visible in the opening warehouse scene... and I not sure why 10 guys with machine guns can't hit Indy from 20 feet away. The movie didn't get any better: uninspired acting and dialogue, boring and drawn out action sequence, and lack of adventure. A waste of time and money for most who enjoyed the prior films. However, it may be enjoyable for the 8 - 12 year old crowd (too bad it was PG-13!).
0399157565|5.0|This book feels lighter than previous novels.  I felt during a few earlier novels that the writer was just unhappy and hated men.  She didn't seem to even like Benton, she did every rotten deed to Marino, and Kay just seemed paranoid and rather bitter.<br /><br />This book is happier, more comfortable to read, more of a page turner. There's a case, and it's interesting and it gets solved. And it's got a happy ending for each of the regular characters:  Marino ends up with the potential for being happy, Kay is content, Benton seems happy, and Lucy is happy.<br /><br />And it wasn't until this book that I realized that Ms. Cornwell never seems to start a sentence with But or Then.  She has an interesting use of And to start off a new thought.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Yes, I'm glad I rented this movie.  I thought it was a very enjoyable.  I would recommend it to others.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Being honest, I thought that since it came out of Hollywood, it would be another mouthpiece for politicians in Washington (ALL of them, OK?). I am one of those weirdos who want what is best for our wonderful country, not what is best for some selfish, greedy politician. So, with that out of the way, this movie was spectacular, both in it's photographic perfection, and in the story it told.<br /><br />And what a story it was. Who knew that OBL was such a crying coward? Kathryn Bigalow did an amazing job of not only ferreting out the real story, but also showed real courage in not pandering to whatever politician brought this bad man to his necessary end. If you are on either the far left or right of the middle politically, you might not find this story satisfying simply because she did NOT give in and make it political.<br /><br />Perhaps, for me, the most astonishing part was finding out that a single woman in her stubborn search for the truth and in finding this vermin, finally made him pay for the thousands of innocent people he murdered. It was a very tense movie, reminiscent of Homeland in which I understand the beautiful character of Carrie in Homeland is based. Nobody in their right minds wants to see violence just for the sake of violence. But I have to say, watching this movie span 12+ years as our country underwent changes in Washington politics and the effect it had on the \\"war\\" on terrorism was almost as spell-binding as the search for OBL which is the main premise of this movie. Jessica Chastain as that woman put in an Oscar-worthy performance which unfortunately, didn't happen, brought her to life in a similar way that Clare Danes in Homeland does and got the Emmy for it!<br /><br />Well done, Ms. Bigelow. Far better than I expected it to be. Highly recommended for most people. A true lesson for the history books.

B008R14YBK|4.0|I am a fan of Bridgit Mendler from &#34;Good Luck Charlie.&#34;  This is her debut CD.  The title song &#34;Ready or Not&#34; has gotten extensive airplay on the Disney Channel and Radio Disney.  This CD should have youth appeal because its genre is similar to those of other young performers as Big Time Rush, Miranda Cosgrove, or Zendaya/Bela Thorne.  Mendler's vocals are good (yet, I suspect, with some electronic enhancement), yet the songs have about the same instrumentation and each gets to sounding like the other. The lyrics seem complex.  I don't hear a lot of musical variety.  Bridgit Mendler and co-star Shane Harper did a lovely Christmas song, &#34;A Song for You&#34; on the Christmas episode of &#34;Good Luck Charlie.&#34;  I think her CD should have had more songs like that.

0345803493|5.0|This second book delves more into the relationship and trust issues of a couple than the erotic, although that is still there.  Has me just as captive as the first book.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I had to have a portrait and landscape easel option.<br />Love the orange. Doesn't get lost in a bag<br />A little stiff rotating. Needs a flat surface to effectively hold the easel position. Not so effective at odd angles in bed.<br />Elastic band is good.<br />Would buy again.
0345803485|5.0|Erotic, yes, but has a story to it as well that becomes comepelling as you want to find out more about the characters backgrounds. Inspite of the erotica, it is a great love/relationship story of two people discovering each other and working out how to be together despite differences.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|I was a Skitch fan but this has layers and numerous other vital features.<br />Only complaint is occasional screen deadspots. Workaround by re-scaling the canvas.<br />Be sure to explore the numerous pages of brush stroke options. Love the textures, blots and patterns.<br />Could have more layer blending choices but the minimal set is good enough.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Look, I'm going to make this easy for you: THIS. BOOK. IS. EXCELLENT.<br /><br />That's all you need to know, I promise. It's interesting, different, refreshing and... well... GOOD.<br /><br />This is not a science FICTION book with aliens, blasters, and bad guys.  No time travel or warp speed here!<br /><br />No, this is a SCIENCE fiction book.  Relateable and believable, using technology that exists or is just around the corner, set in a time frame we can identify with and believe.  But none of that is why it is good.<br /><br />Andy Weir's style is unique and fun, his character witty in a way that comes across incredibly real... and incredibly funny.  I don't typically love Journal-style novels.  Personal preference, they are designed to tell the story from one perspective to really put you in the world of that single character.  If you like that, you like it; if you don't, you don't.  Despite my preferences against, &#34;The Martian&#34; was incredibly interesting and fun to read.<br /><br />You will like this book if: you like science, Mars, astronauts and space travel, funny dialogue, and a good mix of action and description.<br /><br />You will not like this book if: you have no taste.<br /><br />I'm kidding.  Mostly.<br /><br />The only common complaint I read here is the language.  Yes, there is a lot of adult language in this book.  It didn't bother me and i think the way it was used perfectly adds to the story.  Let's be honest, you'd be cursing a lot, too, if you were stranted on another world with virtually no chance for survival!  If I could go back and have the story written with less &#34;Bad&#34; language - I would not.<br /><br />Read and love this book.<br /><br />And you, Mr. Weird... WRITE MORE.  To any who don't know: this is just a hobby for Andy Weird and not a full time money-making gig.  Beg of him to write more, because talented indpendant authors like this are few and far between!
B00B89WXYS|3.0|Pop band OneRepublic return with their third effort, [[ASIN:B00B89WXYS Native]] via Interscope. Native arrives four years after the collective's previous effort, [[ASIN:B002SEW5WW Waking Up]], which was driven by singles \\"All The Right Moves\\", \\"Secrets\\", and \\"Good Life\\". The Colorado originated group have scored two gold albums, looking for Native to score another  - or better yet platinum.  Expectedly, Ryan Tedder and company deliver gargantuan, heavy-hitting drums and anthemic, catchy choruses over the course of 12 tracks (17 tracks on the deluxe edition).  Native isn't new in the innovative sense, but for the most part, it is enjoyable pop effort.<br /><br />\\"Counting Stars\\" starts things off well. Opening initially with Tedder singing the chorus in stripped fashion, the opener transforms into your standard pop cut with a driving beat.  The lyrics are catchy, particularly the chorus (\\"Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep / dreaming about the things that we could be...sitting, no more counting dollars / we'll be counting stars...\\" The best moment? The epic vocal treatment of the bridge section (\\"Take that money / watch it burn / sing in the river / the lessons are learnt...\\") \\"If I Lose Myself\\" continues consistently, characterized by driving keyboard synths, drum programming, and lovely falsetto by frontman Tedder.  The cut transforms in epic crescendoing fashion during the chorus, with a superb vamp materializing after that (\\"Take us down and we keep trying / 40,000 feet keep flying...\\"). The grooviness of \\"Feel Again\\" is no surprise, with Tedder delivering soulful vocals over soaring production work.  The exclamation point? The combination of two separate ideas from the chorus towards the end.  The only quibble would be there is a bit 'less song' to work with, but it is solid overall.<br /><br />\\"What You Wanted\\" is a bit narrower, where songwriting is concerned, but is definitely no deal breaker.  Tedder's best moment is on a capable second verse, where he drives home lyrics \\"I'll put your poison in my veins / they say the best love is insane / I'll light your fire till my last day...\\" \\"I Live\\" atones for any improprieties, noted for inspiring lyrics (\\"Hope when you take that jump / don't you fall...\\" or \\"Hope if everyone runs you choose to stay...\\" The production as well as Tedder's vocals continue to shine, while the optimism might be the showstopper here.  \\"Light It Up\\" doesn't quite reach the same level, finding Tedder's vocals a bit covered in the dense production work. \\"Can't Stop\\" answers more compellingly, featuring prominent use of piano within the production  work and fine drum programming as always.  Jeff Bhasker's influence is all over the cut, providing a lift to the band.<br /><br />\\"Au Revoir\\" isn't bad, but indulges too much over the course of nearly five minutes in duration.  Atonement arrives (as always) with the standout \\"Burning Bridges\\", which finds Tedder singing in his lower register during the verse.  He soars into falsetto on the back half of an exceptional refrain: \\"I, I keep on running / I'm building bridges that I know you never wanted / look for my heart / you stole it away... listen I want you to burn my bridges down...you set me free / set me on fire / you can burn my bridges down...\\"  \\"Something I Need\\" lacks a bit in overall development, though not in message.  That said, it's not bad and has its moments.  The gospel touch of \\"Preacher\\" is more alluring, intact with gospel-infused vocals and a strong sense of inspiration.  The closing track \\"Don't Look Now\\" segues from \\"Preacher\\", touchingly concluding Native.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00B89WXYS Native]] is pleasant, though not 'revolutionary.' Tedder and company stick to their script, but do so with sound execution and no definitive misses.  It's not always 'exciting' but It is sometimes 'middle-of-the-road' pop done well.  And honestly, how many pop/rock artists are really innovators in 2013? 3 stars minimally; 3 ½ stars at bestfor a good album.for a good album.
B008CRC506|5.0|This show is always entertaining! Love the music and all the drama. Funny at times too. Great cast and story lines!
B00B69UQJY|4.0|British alternative pop/rock band Depeche Mode follow up their 2009 Grammy-nominated effort [[ASIN:B001IBIQU6 Sounds Of The Universe]] (Best Alternative Music Album) with 2013s [[ASIN:B00B69UQJY Delta Machine]] (Columbia Records).  Delta Machine benefits from its dark and sometimes malicious nature.  Only few times does the effort miss the upmost consistency; even in doing so, the damage is minimal.<br /><br />\\"Welcome To My World\\" opens with a malicious sound effect. Synthetic kick drums establish the groove, while the production is spare as frontman David Gahan begins to sing.  The chorus is epic and well penned: \\"And if you stay a while / I'll penetrate your soul / I'll bleed into your dreams / you'll want to lose control / I'll weep into your eyes / I'll make your visions sing...welcome to my world.\\" Harmonized backing vocals add to the drama and overall darkness.  \\"Angel\\" is a stronger cut, again dwelling in darkness at the onset.  Gahan's vocals are more assertive and pained than before.  Add to Gahan's vocals pained lyrics that match, such as the amazing lines \\"The angel of the lord was upon me / and Lord I felt so clean...I waded into the water / I was bathed, I was drowned / like all sinners before me / I knelt down on the ground...\\" \\"Angel\\" is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Heaven\\" continues the consistency, delivering another superb offering.  Gahan's balladry here grabs the emotions of the audience, supported and incited by clever synthetic ideas and sound overall production.  On \\"Secret To The End\\", the tempo is quicker. \\"Secret\\" isn't the best of Delta Machine, but has some great moments including the colorful synths during the chorus section, the allowance of space between chorus and the proceeding verse allowing the cut to 'breathe', and a vamping on the extended chorus on lyrics \\"Should have been you...\\".  \\"My Little Universe\\" bests \\"Secret To The End\\" , featuring spare production with timely instrumental ornaments and effects.  The vocal production shines throughout the cut.<br /><br />\\"Slow\\" stands out from the rest of Delta Machine.  Sporting a surprising bluesy nature, the drum groove seals the deal given the cut this folksy-alt quality.  Opening off-puttingly with the refrain (which has a different harmonic progression than the verse), the cut settles in and its magic is quickly reveal.  \\"Broken\\" does reach the same triumphant peak, but is still solid as anything else. \\"When you're falling / I will catch you / you don't have to fall that far / you can make it / I will be there / You were broken from the start\\", Gahan sings on the chorus.  \\"The Child Inside\\" continues to portray 'darkness' through its emotional, chilling lyrics (\\"There is a darkness and death in your eyes / what have you got buried inside? / The shallow grave in your soul / the ghost that have taken control...\\"). The follow-up cut \\"Soft Touch / Raw Nerve\\" smartly contrasts with a spryer tempo, sporting a driving synth that is brash and overt in sound.  Lyrically, much of the lines are posed in an inquisitive manner, which contrasts the rest of  Delta Machine.<br /><br />\\"Should Be Higher\\" opens with a lush, pad synth.  Additionally, a electronic groove is established, typical of the band.  Like some of the other cuts on this affair, Depeche Mode differentiate the harmonic scheme of the chorus from that of the verse, a technique more bands/artists in general could try more often.  Like the multitude, songwriting is a strong point and helps make \\"Should Be Higher\\" one of the elite cuts.  \\"Alone\\" follows consistently, featuring constant rhythm care of its pummeling kick drums. Gahan continues an emotional trip, which characterizes his fine vocal performance.  \\"Soothe My Soul\\" isn't bad by any means, but it doesn't possess the same depth as many of its colleagues. Concluding selection \\"Goodbye\\" is more than sufficient atonement, again dabbling in the blues, supported by an exceptional buttressing beat and clear, compelling vocals by Gahan.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00B69UQJY Delta Machine]] is another fine addition to Depeche Mode's discography. Dark, emotional, and mysterious, this effort easily has more pros than cons.  Not every cut is valedictory, but none are misses either.  Above average by all means, Delta Machine is definitely worthy of some spins.  4 stars.ahan.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00B69UQJY Delta Machine]] is another fine addition to Depeche Mode's discography.

0345803485|5.0|So this book came before I even expected it maybe about 2-3 days and it's in perfect condition I'm very happy about it. I read the book on my phone awhile ago and now I have a hard copy (no pun intended) to enjoy. Can't wait to reread this book as well as the rest of the series
B000VWYNNW|2.0|In a musically technical sense, this album is a total bummer. The band sounds like they can't find their sweet spot, everything seems \\"lumbering\\" for lack of a better word. The Who's Isle of Wright has the same problem - there's no punch, like HTWWW or Live at Leeds has, respectively. Unless you can find this at your local library, pass.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I wanted to write this review because of the great customer service by Amazon.  The Movie was overall a good movie, not my most favorite, but a well made action packed movie.  Thus, the 4 star rating, because well it wasn't my favorite.<br /><br />However, when I was streaming this video from Amazon, randomly I would lose connection to there server. The connection would drop and resolution would drop as well.  Personal I understand that the internet has many crazy reason for failing.  So, the reason I'm telling you all this is because a day later I received an Email from Amazon apologizing for the bad connection.  They then refunded my Credit Card for the 4.99 I spent on renting this movie.  For this, I will Shop at Amazon and Rent movies from them.  They care that you have a great experience with online streaming.<br /><br />Thank<br />Hans

B001ANSSDC|2.0|I'd heard about the movie and wanted to read the book first.<br />Having first hand experience with mental illness, I was hoping for something believable.<br />While this book may appeal to some, I was just forcing myself to finish.<br />Meh
B000XUBFE2|2.0|So I read this book because it did intrigue me and got good ratings on GoodReads but a few chapters in I could tell it wasn't for me. I finished the book and would saw I enjoyed the last few chapters only.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I have been in a book slump lately.<br />I was looking for something with well drawn characters and an engaging and unpredictable plot.<br />I HATE being able to guess the ending by the end if the first chapter.<br /><br />This book hit all the high notes.<br />And I absolutely LOVED the way the characters were described and the way the plot unfolded.<br />Highly recommend.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Good movie, they should make more movies like this, it was not only entertaining but also a true story.<br />Recommend it to everyone.
B001FB55YE|5.0|there was no scratches of any kind. the movie played fine. it was like brand new, if not, the closest thing.
B005OLNOW6|5.0|This album and group is amazing for sure. Hurts has a very unique style combined with 80s rythims. Downloading the album via amazon was very practical and quick.
B00BI745AA|4.0|Hugh Jackman should have won the Oscar for his role. Great movie, might have been better with less singing and some talking.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This would make a great movie! It should be directed by the Coen Brothers. It spans several years, nearly a hundred of course, and references several historical events, people and different countries. Allan is knee deep in politics and political leaders without concern of ever truly involving himself.  He is more concerned with common sense and social etiquette. He is endearing and floats through heavy situations.
B005J2UM9S|2.0|Scares are few & far between...seems like &#34;skeleton crew&#34; day (ha !!) @ the old asylum...gotta do a LOT of corridor-walking to get even one spirit-standing-in-the-corner (a la Blair Witch) action, & then they shove their scary face @ ya, & that's it !! No follow up, no explanation, or attempt @ one...too much reliance on the old &#34;heavy doors that shut all by themselves&#34; routine, also. They must've had a miniscule creature/ spirit/special effects budget, cause it's like a big ol' choc. chip cookie w/ only 2 measly chips in it, not that the surrounding cookie part is anything special. Hard to believe that this dreck spawned a SEQUEL !!<br />I love most found footage flicks, & really dug &#34;Blair Witch&#34;, &#34;Rec&#34;, & &#34;Cloverfield&#34;, but this one is POOR...as is often the case, the trailer has all the best scares...should've called this flick &#34;Dead Air&#34;.  Avoid if @ all possible, folks !!
0316113514|5.0|I've been so frustrated by mental health stuff (shadowy stuff).  Finally.    Recently PTSD post-partum and am generally good with meds, but a little off.  (ADHD)    Update: PTSD cured by tap therapy (variant of EMDR).      Update on health generally... A book, a new idea or an app didn't get me normal/productive.  Fish oil (Nordic Naturals - trying others) and vit D (rainbow light gummies only) did.  Ran out of vit d and got negative/lost sleep.  Took it again and got happy/social with good sleep again.  Ran out of fish oil and got lost in weeds/lost the view of the forest and lethargic.  I need it again.  Found my answer and it's consistent vitamins.  Never been healthier.  I should also exercise more and probably will.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Buen producto, de muy buena calidad, lo recomiendo... Very good and very nice product, I recommend it to all of you.
B007N85POS|4.0|and its free, what more can you ask for! fun game, interesting trying to get used to some of the moves, its challenging and fun. not too hard
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a fan of De Mille and John Corey.  This is a very weak entry in the colletion of Corey stories.  This is not an action book, but rather a travelogue.  If you have a burning desire to learn about Yemen, this book is for you.  If you want to know which roads to take from one city to another, or from the airport to the city this book is for you.  If you want to spend pages and pages wandering through old town Sana'a and visiting all the shops and bazaars, this book is for you.  If you have a burning desire to understanding Yemeni history, or to learn about the Bedouin this book will do that for you.  If you want to spend hours reading about cocktail parties and lunches and dinners where the characters tell you all you never wanted to know about Yemen, this book will do that.  If you want action, skip to about the last 10% of the book, because that's where it all is.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|fun, but a little hard getting used to the controlling. overall not a waste of time. i got bored easily though. i might delete it
B00992CF6W|5.0|u people who say make the updates come faster are dumb they also have to update the game for 4 other devices so expect a update about every 2 months
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Just an amazing album by a creative and unique band.  Beautiful, Lennon-esque vocals.  Epic rhythm section.  An inspired blend of the best influences with its own style.  If this keeps up, this band will be creating albums that are the soundtracks to generations like The Beatles, Radiohead, Sabbath, Nirvana.  Just lovely.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love my camera. It works well with instagram.  I love the many functions it has. Pictures are very clear.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|Great album, another side of Freddie Mercury's multi faceted talent. Got the album in two days, quicker than expected. Very extremely satisfied.
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|And I say that bc I haven't fully used it.  I was able to see some of my files on the computer. However, I think my problem is, I don't know what I am doing or why I needed it. If you know what you are doing and have a reason to use it, I think its worth trying.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|definitely food for thought, interesting time period, learned a great deal about the constitution, the President. Good movie to see.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|It get's the job done. It has a large interface. Good for bad eyes or big fingers. I like it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I tried it hoping it would be like Mario bros and it is, only it's a leprechaun instead. I am having a lot of fun playing this game and I think a lot of you will to if you take a minute or two to try it. If you loved Mario bros than you'll like this.
B0001I561E|5.0|I love this movie and especially the music! i just wish it was a little bit longer. my son really enjoys the bonus game..its like being on a 3d ride/coaster that you have to interact with.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|This movie has no equal in the sci-fi genre. Before star wars you could count great space movies with one hand and have fingers left over; you probably still can. You have to compare it to any other sci-fi movie of the 50`s and 60's to see how ingenious and original this was and how much care and attention was put into the making of it at a time when sci-fi was relegated to cheap and hokey B-movies. Every sci-fi movie that followed it has to bow down to this sci-fi masterpiece. If you're into today's digitized effects and popcorn plot-less, character-less summer blockbusters you may not like it, but you should still be able to appreciate it.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I cant say much about this because well...its FOREST GUMP! its a classic for a reason so just get it already!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|You really can tell that Blake has grown as an artist. This album captures that along with his charm and sense of humor.  The album also has a nice flow..starting off with the rowdy &#34;Boys 'round here&#34;  then moving to a more mellow feel then back to rowdy again finishing off with a song that makes you appreciate the keepsakes you receive from family. I really enjoyed &#34;Lay Low&#34; and &#34;Mine Would Be You&#34; and there are several top hits here imho. If you are a fan you will not be disappointed..if you are just now starting to listen to Blake Shelton this album will make you a fan. Enjoy!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Can't believe the one-star reviews on here.  This is a heart-pumping thrill-ride from beginning to end. Somehow the film-makers manage to show a grittier, believable version of the world of Dredd than anyone has managed before - while still maintaining the technicolor gloss of a comic book story.<br /><br />The non-stop action is thrilling, & slow-mo sequences are awesome. A compelling storyline with enough twists to keep you emotionally invested - I found myself caring about what might happen to the rookie Anderson in the same way Dredd might!<br /><br />A truly 5-star movie!
B009FZFONO|5.0|From the opening theme music accompanying scenes of hair and flesh on a saw and a zombie eye darting back and forth...this show is top-notch, and Season 3 is the best, tensest, most satisfying horror there is! It really feels like I'm right THERE, alongside these real people, struggling to survive, making tough choices, every time I watch this! I love TWD!
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|Still captivating 3 decades after it came out, this movie is so good because James Cameron appears to have had complete control over the film-making process - there are no signs of overpaid studio executive producers stamping their authority on the film just for the sake of it.<br /><br />It's not just the ultimate Director's movie, it's also got to be the ultimate 'B' movie - it has all the hallmarks: independent studio, relatively low budget, sci-fi genre, high-concept storyline, and unknown actors (don't forget, pretty much no one in this movie was well known before its release, not even Arnie - this movie really launched his career)<br /><br />Should still be studied by film students looking how to make a movie - not just an indie one, but a truly great one.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The story was gripping and interesting from page one. I wanted to know what would happen to the two main characters.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love the access to albums with Fastrip right after the purchase. I can download right to my phone and have the CD on the way. So far it works well on my motorola photon 4g.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina is a great writer and most down to earth New Yorker I have not ever met. I laughed many times and then reread those parts to my husband so he didn't think I was nuts.<br />Tina is a gifted and humbled writer who I love. Thank you Tina for a great vacation laugh!
1575666286|5.0|I purchased this book to have as a reference of the information already learned through videos and documentaries of Charlotte Gerson and her father Dr. Max Gerson. I'm so happy to see that Charlotte has carried on her fathers work and hope that this information continues to be shared.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|At first I didn't know what to expect but once I started to play it was super fun. I'm not allowed to connect with social stuff so had to wait to skip that challenge though. Other than that, now it's actually REALLY sorta' fun.
B009JBZH54|5.0|awesome trilogy love all batman movies!!!!! love how they all come together. the special features are great. must watch movie
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|Use it when im stuck somewhere with nothing else to do. Good way to waste time. Good clean fun for everyone.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|awesome movie! very scary!!!! I love Daniel he is a great actor! must watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!! you will love it!!!
B00846WWVM|5.0|Good entertaining game. Play it when Im stuck somewhere with nothing else to do. Good time waster. Fun for everyone.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|There is NO doubt about it, Disney is truly without a doubt THE master of taking delightful stories from ones childhood and turning them into amazing musicals.  I grew up with ALL sorts of Disney flicks, including The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc.  Even THIS piece of forever great classic nostalgia.  The special features are just amazing, the story hits all bulls eyes, and everything else is just done incredibly.  If you grew up with this film and/or you have kids, then THIS is a great Disney film for kids and adults of ALL ages.  It's a tale as old as time, and song as old as rhyme…  Beauty and the Beast: The best Disney fairytale out of all their works, in my opinion.<br /><br />PS: For those of you who're wondering the Beast's real name as the prince though it's never revealed in the film, it's Adam.  Fill free to look at Wikipedia if you don't believe me.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The Book was a good enough read but at times a little wayward, must have been a horrible time over there and we do need to realize what the requirements for returning military personnel is.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|There isn't a whole lot to like about this eagerly anticipated album from where I sit (on the NY subway, earbuds crammed in tight, The Next Day playing for the umptytumpth time as I try and find something, anything on which to hang my interest).<br /><br />Monotonous \\"melodies\\", tired vocal technique, lyrics that are so inappropriate to the grandad-of-rock vocal technique they border on Bathos ('Dirty Boys\\" is an example of this - he moans of running amok in a gang and wreaking havoc with a cricket bat but all I can picture from the vocal technique is Bowie shuffling along with a Zimmer) and muddy mixes that lose the lyrics in walls of sonic Meh. Hard to believe Tony Visconti produced this to be honest - there was a clear jump in overall accessibility and quality when he returned to the desk.<br /><br />After three dozen and more The Next Day listenings I find occasional snatches of something okay, but nothing that grabs me and says \\"Here! *This* makes the whole thing worth while!\\" There are clear links in most of this material with \\"Reality\\" (a much better album on every level from my perspective) and \\"Hours\\" (not very fond of that one to be honest - Bowie sounds whiny on most of the tracks) but that material hasn't gone anywhere interesting for me. I don't doubt that somewhere I am \\"missing the point\\" but I ceased to care after about the fifth replaying. If the artist obscures his message that well he obviously doesn't want me to find it.<br /><br />I still have the album on my space-challenged iPod Nano but I'm not playing it as a first choice now, and I've relegated it to background noise while I do something else. Maybe that way something good will impinge subliminally on the old brain and wake my enthusiasm. It's happened before.<br /><br />On the other hand I remember back when it was a new album reports of Bowie being enraged that \\"Heroes\\" was a hit , as the intent had been to produce something non-commercial, and he used a similar \\"wish I weren't famous\\" argument for the marketing of \\"Outside\\" two decades later. Perhaps he has finally produced his Lorelei album - the uncommercial record that will only be loved by makers of Volkswagen ads.<br /><br />The cover concept is weak. I thought the \\"Post-it on Heroes\\" picture was a cunning place-keeper for some yet-to-be-seen artistic brilliance when I pre-ordered the CD a month and a half before it would be sent to me. Imagine my joy to find that no, that *was* the brilliant art concept. Not since Yes's \\"Tormato\\" has a cover plumbed such depths of blah.<br /><br />Lazy and unimaginative. The insert continues the bad-thinking meme, so badly designed it is a joke and an insult to graphic designers in general. You get a lyric sheet so you can figure out the bits you can't hear through the \\"music\\". Turn it over and: a stupid and needless recapitulation of the cover \\"design\\" in reds and yellows for 2/3 of it, and the info you might be interested in reading (like who was playing what, where) in microscopic type you need a jeweler's loupe to read in the bottom 1/3.<br /><br />Hey Lame-ass graphic designer! If you were so in love with your stupid \\"post-it\\" idea you had to make us look at it twice, why didn't you do the decent thing and print the track participant info over the top of it in a readable point size and color? Do you seriously think this album will be avidly collected by people *without* aging eyes?<br /><br />All in my very, very disappointed opinion of course. Your mileage will certainly vary, and The Next Day has given me a new appreciation for \\"Let's Dance\\", which hitherto I considered unplayable post-disco pap.gument for the marketing of \\"Outside\\" two decades later.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|THIS SHOW GETTING MORE AND MORE BETTER. i LIKE THE MOVIE QUALITY ALSO. I LIKE THE WAY THEY PUT THE EPISODES TOGETHER.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I liked this book because it described many traits that I have but have never been able to &#34;justify&#34; as being OK traits to have.  Always felt that I should live up to the way other people are.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you are reading the series you are already a fan.  My husband and I are reading the series together, we can't wait for the next one.
B001K3KK0Q|3.0|Where is the  version with Alan Ladd.  I saw this years ago when I had just discovered Fitzgerald and I will never forget many of the scenes.  I do not remember the rest of the cast, but Alan Ladd was a convincing Gatsby.  Hope it will be brought to DVD sometime soon.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Just what I needed as a backup when I travel.  Make sure your device volume is turned up to high.
B000P7V45S|5.0|Everybody knows that 80's era Phil Collins was spawned from the blood of a wild, raw flesh eating animal, but few know that 70's era Phil Collins was twice as nasty! Genesis is without a doubt the nastiest in classically trained progressive musicianship (Bands like Moody Blues and Yes can take a effin hike!)<br /><br />This is from just after Peter Gabriel left the band. Back when Phil Collins vocals were way more cockney/british sounding than his later more Americanized tone. He still plays the H-E- hockey sticks out of that percussion kit, as he was at the time, just a drummer making the cross over to vocals. He wails it out on choice tracks such as SQUONK and the title peice, but every track is a winner. DANCE ON A VOLCANOE?! and LOS ENDOS is probably the greatest bit of 1976 electronic keyboard groovin' you will ever hear in your short and sorry lives! Thank you Genesis, as always, my jaw is on the floor!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|As a mechanical engineer I found this book very exciting and thought provoking. Told in such a realistic way that it seems like we could have a base on mars like this next week. Well worth the price!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Definitely worth the buy. Will keep you wanting to watch another episode. Its got it all. Drama, a touch of comedy, suspense, gore. Highly recommended.
B009PF93LS|5.0|Love this CD (album).  Next best thing to Bing Crosby.  Sent copies to my relatives.  Bought it specifically for my daughter.
B006HL9G10|4.0|I love the bell tones and it is easy to use. The option to save presets is a great convenience. I would give it 5 stars if it was an easier transition between timers when I am doing a series of asanas and meditations in a row. Otherwise, its user friendly and pleasant to use.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I loved the inside view of the presidents.  The long shadow that President Nixon cast is amazing.  The role President Eisenhower held is also amazing.  I came away feeling sorry for President Johnson and lost even more respect for President Carter.  How President Obama acts when he joins this club will be interesting to watch.
B008K9UZY4|3.0|Maybe I'm not smart enough to run this game. There were a couple places I could not get the character to jump over. He woudl only jump up and down.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|4 and 6 year old girls sat mesmerized. Well worth just $2.99. It enabled the family to enjoy an Easter dinner
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|Grudger is too juvenile for me.  May be great for the really young set, like 5 or 6 years old.  Please consider adding age rating.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is AWESOME!! My daughter and I love this game! We love the other 2 temple runs also but this one has some really cool stuff in it. Stuff just keeps coming at you. Very addicting game and super fun. We can play it for hours!
B004QSQML8|5.0|We always loved the cinematography of Legend, While I felt more could be down to add a little more saturation to give it more of the fantasy world feeling, they did do a good job non the less, glad they took the time to take advantage to bring this classic on Blu Ray.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|My daughter got frustrated with this game and so did i. Should be made more simple. We only played it for a short while before we got bored with it. Seemed like too much to do just to get something complete? ok game but not what i expected.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|While not the kinda movie known for it's great deeply thought out plot, it does it's job providing entertainment for everyone, the level of details shown on Blu ray are amazing!
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|THIS GAME IS NOT SO GOOD BECAUSE THIER IS ONILY ONE CHARACTER IN THIS GAME AND OW  YA IT IS BORING DO NOT EVEN WAste 99$

B00BL5EQLC|5.0|As of today,  4/2/2013, there was an update fixing the controls to be more sensitive and so far so good. The game overall is very fun and the graphics are great. Thanks.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was amazing and breath taking all at the same time. I would reread this book over one hundred times and still be amazed at the wonderful story it held. And the story you see between the lines.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Probably not going to end up in the &#34;Greatest Bond Movies of All Time&#34; category, but fun, entertaining, and keeps with the current style of &#34;Daniel Craig Bond.&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|that i should get the game because i liked to play itnand i don't have the game to play it
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was basically what I expected. It reminded me a lot of the cheerleader movies and some dance movies. It was very funny at some parts. I fell in love with some of the characters (the nerd with the magic and hamster), and completely hated others (head of the opposing male group).
0735619670|5.0|Enjoyed the reading... I would recommend this book to anyone who would seek to find out about how specifically to plan out and structure your computer programming process. Indispensable.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The trailer does not make justice to this movie. The movie is really good. I completely recommend it. Happy watching.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved this season, never a dull moment. I can;t wait for season 4. No other show I watch compares to this one.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is my new favorite movie. Anna Kendrick was great and Rebel Wilson is hilarious! I wish my college had an a capella group...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Nothing but love for The Hunger Games Trilogy! Was excellent reading from start to finish!  Very happy with the final book ; even though parts of it made me cry.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I've read this book several times and I always liked it. It has a catchy theme and conflict. The ending is not disappointing either.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have the Kindle Fire&trade; and it works great! I don't know why people are saying it has a virus... It doesn't..<br />You can download either as a video or a MP3 it's cool if you don't wanna pay an insane amount for music. (like me)<br />It you wanna listen to the music (and you have a Kindle Fire&trade;) go to the &quot;Music&quot; selection, then you'll see it! (: Your welcome. :)<br />But anyways I would so recommend this.
B009GED3HS|5.0|the show tugs at my emotion strings, making me dance a dance of life like a roller coaster. sweet baby hey zeus i can't get enough
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Daniel Day-Lewis' performance was definitely worth watching. However, for one who isn't a history buff the other main characters might not be recognized for their contribution and connection to history and the story. Who is Preston Blair (OK, he did say he was the founder of the Republican Party) ... Balboa and Latham ... bet you never heard of them before this movie? Secretary of State Seward's portrayal was stirring and Thadeus Stevens unforgettable. Overall all the players and the story line pieces just didn't fit together well.
B006546EPA|5.0|This is an almost perfect Richard Strauss complete work setting. The orchestral with Rudolf Kempe is phenomenal and beautiful. The interpretation are full of details that make the tone poems easy to follow in their musical action. The opera are references for some, the Karajan is the reference for Der Rosenkavalier, Böhm Salome and Keilberth Frau as well. The others are beautifully interpreted by Sinopoli and Voigt. The orchestral songs with Charlotte Margiono and Edo de Waart gives you the chill and goosebumps of the incredible music. The lieder accompanied by Richard Strauss himself on the piano is an historical document that give to that collection an incredible value. Didn't yet had time to listen to all the other set of Chamber, piano music but I'm sure that they won't deceive me, and even if they do I had plenty enough for my money's worth and much more. Don't hesitate this is the bargain of the century.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|A wonderful movie production of my favorite stage musical. The songs are amazing, the orchestration is so beautiful, and the acting is great! Every moment and note of this movie makes it a masterpiece to be enjoyed time and time again, as the story of Les Miserables is one of all time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! I LOVED IT SO MUCH I READ IT ALL IN ONE DAY I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. IN LOVE!!!!! :) :) :) ;) &lt;3 &lt;3<br />Marissa
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Enjoyable (if not profound) movie about taking risks (even if sometimes compelled from without), across habitual and cultural boundaries, that can lead to new, serendipitous discoveries.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|I have owned this case for just about a year and it is by far the best case for the money, period.  I have tried more expensive ones and certainly less expensive ones.  This fits my iPhone 4S perfectly and I  like the openings for charging, and control access.  This case is heavy and pliable and just what I wanted.  It is NOT hard plastic, nor mushy rubber or silicone.  I have dropped the phone on the carpet and kitchen floor with no negative effects. The cover stays on the iPhone perfectly and allows to lay the iPhone face down with full screen protection. Amazon hit a home run on this one. I just ordered two more as I am getting another phone and then have a spare in case they sell out.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Mt whole family loves this game. Even our 3 year old got the hang of it. She calls it the monsters. Need more levels!!!
1451695195|5.0|The empirical scientific world of senses is placed into a broader context of spirituality in a very dramatic life-death struggle.<br />The story shows the limitations of a narrow, though valuable, scientific worldview.

B007RXC3A8|3.0|Sure, I know a title like that doesn't help you decide for against buying the album.  So I'll try to break it down into pros and cons.    (That was actually one of five titles I came up with.  The others are:  1)  \\"Now is a good time to get into Sonata\\"  2)  \\"seriously lacking ambition\\"  3)  \\"...I think Sonata's the one who wants a \\"S***load of Money.\\"\\"  4)  \\"the simplest, least lyrically-ambitious, least metal Sonata album to date\\")    I've always anticipated new Sonata Arctica albums ever since the release of Winterheart's Guild in 2003.  Sonata has always been the type of the band that can wow a different fan with each and every song on their albums.  \\"The Power of One\\" is my favorite Sonata song; my niche is in the \\"San Sebastian\\"s, \\"Wolf & Raven\\"s, and \\"Victoria Secret\\"s; and I can't sit still whenever \\"Don't Say a Word\\" comes on.  What I'm not is someone who loved \\"Wildfire\\" back on Reckoning Night.  This is a good place to dive in to pros and cons.    Con:  Division.  The album comes across as two EPs put together:  1) the first 9 songs (35 minutes), 2) parts II and III of Wildfire (16 minutes).  The Wildfire songs bear the most semblance to an older Sonata style while the first 9 songs don't (more on that later).  There is great confusion in that transition between tracks 9 and 10.    Con:  The Wildfires themselves.  Do you remember Dream Theater and the Metropolis song from 1992's Images and World's?  The band went on to make an entire album that continued to tell the Metropolis story.  Fans don't understand why they did that; why couldn't they leave good enough as good enough?  Iced Earth did the same thing more recently.  Now we have Sonata Arctica - a band who has a song CALLED \\"Good Enough Is Good Enough,\\" yet they want to revisit Wildfire and occupy 16 minutes of this album with a continuation of that story?  From this, I conclude the following:  Sonata Arctica didn't have enough material for the main story of Stones Grow Her Name, and so tagged this on.  Well guess what - it makes a mess.  If these 16:00 were an epic conclusion to the story tracks 1-9 deal with, THEN we might have something exciting here.  But if I want more about a boy who burns his hometown, I'll reread Steven King's \\"The Stand\\" and the Trashcan Man character.    Con:  Sonata Arctica used to be a band that reached high.  I remember the days of the amazing solos found in \\"Wolf and Raven.\\"  I remember the days of the moving, reflective ballads, such as \\"The End of This Chapter,\\" \\"Draw Me,\\" and \\"Replica.\\"  I remember the days of the songs that spoke out to the listener, such as \\"Destruction Preventer,\\" \\"Blank File,\\" and to-date, the band's longest song, \\"The Power of One.\\"    (Neutral):  Then, Sonata Arctica signed with Nuclear Blast and released their fourth album, Reckoning Night.  The band began to show signs of changing.  Unia saw the band looking in a new direction entirely.  Gone are the fast solos and varying song length.  Unia was simply boring, given the band's back catalogue.  (I should have seen this coming with the logo change.)  It was, however, the most to-date radio-friendly release the band has put out.  Take a look at its single and the lyrics \\"I need you / less and less everyday\\" - that's got radio-single written all over it.    Pro (except that it's not even for Stones Grow Her Name):  2009 saw a revival of not just Sonata Arctica, but several power metal bands (ex. Stratovarius, Cain's Offering, and in early 2010, Rhapsody of Fire).  The 8-minute opener, Deathaura, revisits the ambition that made this band great once.  \\"Flag In the Ground\\" is a lyrically-moving song in the vein of \\"The Power of One\\" or \\"Destruction Preventer\\" without being an epic.  The title track, \\"The Days of Grays,\\" is one of those reflective songs, like \\"Replica.\\"    Con and Pro:  Stones Grow Her Name revisits the snore that Unia was, except this time, we have a story.    Con:  If Unia and The Days of Grace were Sonata Arctica's most \\"progressive\\" albums,then this is the band's most \\"rock\\" or \\"North American-style\\" album to date.  The band clearly isn't interested in melodic/power metal anymore, and this is one of the most puzzling things imaginable.  Why a band would give up the more-sophisticated for the less-sophisticated is beyond me.  I'm someone who started off as a pop/rock fan, then became a metal fan, and spends almost no time looking back.    Con:  Sonata Arctica has always had a poppy/rock-edge to them, but it was restrained by the Stratovarius influences on the early albums.  Beginning with Reckoning Night, the pop/rock influences began to take over and overshadow the power metal.  By this album, the power metal is almost entirely gone.    Con:  This is now a riff-driven album, where it used to be keyboard-driven or atmosphere-driven.  Remember the amazing opening catch of \\"San Sebastian\\" and \\"Victoria's Secret?\\"  We haven't had one of those since the Winterheart's Guild days.    Con:  I just can't sink my teeth into this album, the way I could with Ecliptica through Reckoning Night and one more time with The Days of Grace.    Con:  Then there's the issue with corny lyrics.  I don't care HOW catchy they are.  When I know a band is capable of \\"The Power of One,\\" I don't want to see \\"s***tload\\" anywhere on the album artwork!  Period!  If this is the direction the band is going, a name change would be appropriate, because this \\"new\\" Sonata is that different from the \\"old\\" Sonata.  Plenty of bands can go for 30 years (Iron Maiden) or 40 years (Scorpions) and simultaneously evolve and maintain their roots such that they both gain new fans and keep the old.  Sonata Arctica has lost a fan in me after this album.    Pro:  Now I'm really digging for a solid positive.  From an instrumental standpoint, I like the Wildfires.  They are innovative and will keep even an experienced power metal listener guessing.    Pro:  Tony's voice.  He hasn't slumped at all.    Pro:  Use of the banjo in \\"Cinderblox\\" works for me.It is an experiment that many fans will doubtlessly disagree with.  I don't mind it; it's only one four-minute song, so how much complaining can you really do?    Pro:  \\"S***load of Money,\\" as preposterous as the lyrics are, is downright catchy.    Pro:  The opener, \\"Only the Broken Hearts (Make You Beautiful)\\" is more than a sound song.  I'm reminded of \\"Mysteria\\" from Edguy's Hellfire Club album.  Neither songs struck me as powerful on my first couple of listens, but after you get used to it, they work.  More importantly, they serve as good examples of the remaining 50 minutes of the albums.  It wouldn't be accurate if a \\"San Sebastian\\" sound-alike opened the album only to have \\"S***load of Money\\" follow.    Pro / Con:  \\"I Have a Right\\" repeats these lyrics seemingly endlessly:    \\"I have a right to be heard to be seen to be loved to be free to be everything  I need to be me to be safe to believe in something.\\"    Again, this is one of those songs that repelled me in my first couple of listens (probably because it reminded me of one of my top-5 most can't-stand songs of all time, Godsmack's \\"I Stand Alone\\").  I get annoyed when a band relies on repetition to this degree.  Because for heaven's sake - find another way to say it, dang it!  But Sonata has a history of making it work with \\"Replica\\" waaaaaay back on Ecliptica.  The words are powerful and Tony does a great job of grabbing the listener by the heart.    Closing comments:  At the end of the day, any power metal fan has to hear a Sonata Arctica album.  Do I recommend it to everyone?  I'm still on the fence.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I like the book it gave more description of the way it happen and the sequence better and I think it was better than the movie
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A book that is inspiring all women to excel and to rise up to the challenges of our sometimes slow moving society.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|We must have watched this movie 100 times by now and we love all the songs I had to get the soundtrack too! Best Kid Disney Movie!
B005LAIHZE|3.0|I though the movies was fun and different. With so much written about Abraham Lincoln and his life, a little escapism doesn't hurt.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how much we love this movie! It makes everyone laugh and it is really great! Love it!
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Loved it from beginning to end. looks great. sounds great. Dave Grohl's passion about the project is infectious and this is a must see for any fan of Dave's or music history.
1616550414|5.0|This is a gift for my girlfriend. She is a huge fan of zelda and will love it or I hope she will
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have not seen the TV show.  I purchased this for something to keep me occupied while on my treadmill.  The characters are numerous but they are all interesting.  You cannot guess who will live and who dies.  It is a very enjoyable read.  I'd recommend that you buy the whole set of Game of Thrones books.  I'm almost finished with the second book and, yes, I will be buying the third!
B000YGIIQI|5.0|Gordon Ramsey doesn't hold punches in the kitchen or about telling you his life story.  Great read, hoping another comes out that picks up where this one left off.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Second book I've read by this author. Interesting insight into the super macho do right mind. Not realistic but passed the time.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|looked forward to seeing this Bourne movie but wasnt anything like the others....  it was boring and will not recommend this one to others
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app!!! I play it all the time! I am an absolute horse lover and even though I don't have a real horse it's nice to get a taste of what taking care of a real one is like!!! I love this app it seems so real!!!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Setup is easy.<br />It will be in the sleeping mode if your phone is out range. It will wake up onece your phone is in the range.<br />Sound quality accetable.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|My opinion is, this was not one of his best movies. He plays a substance addicted pilot. I didn't feel there was a lot of imagination required, to play that part. I read, somewhere, there had been some &#34;Oscar buzz,&#34; associated with his role in this movie. I didn't see how that would have happened. I have seen him do some much, much better acting.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I check out the American version of this film, and it wasn't nearly as good as this, which is spooky and downright excellent. Get this one.
0307742997|2.0|the idea is a good one and there is definitely potential but the book is simply a disappointment. it starts off slowly but interesting, then The Snowman just drags on and on. the story line picks up towards the end but it's not enough to make up for a bad story. i can't recommend this book to anyone and this is probably my last Nesbo book.
B00422LESO|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to keep going 20 pages in. But I'm glad I did. Fun read. I enjoyed the characters and the ending surprised me.
B00338QENI|3.0|I wish I had read this book in biology instead of for entertainment.  The author did a good job in her research and seemed to be doing right by the family, and it's the same old story where the poor stay poor and the rich get richer on some poor souls bad health.  Don't know that times have changed much but we can all be greatful for the research that was done on Henrietta Lacks tumor!!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Several years ago I was able to watch the first season, but due to circumstance, unable to watch season 2.  This was a wonderful opportunity to watch the complete series.<br /><br />The actors in this complex drama of intrigue, treachery, violence, and moral ambiguity are exceptional.  Beautiful cinematography, costumes and makeup complete this awesome spectacle.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I've loved every release by this band.  This and Star Crossed Wasteland are my favs.  They just keep getting better and better!
B00499NHLC|3.0|The gem of this season is the final episode. I won't spoil a second of it so rest assured. This series is a traditional Holmes & Watson set in modern Britain. Great casting & production values breathe life to very familiar characters here. I recommend this and would've given it a higher rating if the 1st two episodes had been as compelling as the final one. Definitely worth the time of any Holmes fan however.
B008602KQI|3.0|Yes, it's very good. Yes, it's riveting, and at times a little emotional. Yes, I want to see the next installment. But still, it was good- not great. I'll even give it very good, but still not great.
B005YZX32I|5.0|This is a fantastic book, I recommend it! Very easy to read, easy to use and has all the necessary information of a clinical base
B007FEFLTO|5.0|So much to learn about the Germany before Hitler and then how hard it was for the German people to cope with the Hitler regime. Also so much more to learn about how the oppressed countries dealt under German rule until the US became involved and began to win the war.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book!! Love the ending.  There is no district 12, what a powerful statement.  Looking forward to the next book
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This item arrived on time and was just as it was described.  I am very pleased with this latest purchase.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|While the stock Android keyboard has improved over time, consistent updates keep SwiftKey on top! Predictive typing is eerily accurate,... No complaints!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great! Love the breakdown of how much power I have left for each feature. My granson showed it to me and i downloaded the app immediately.  Thanks, Max!
B009AOFNU4|2.0|I have to admit I was really excited when I ordered this wireless controller, I have a bunch of games in both my iPhone and iPad and really thought this would be useful, especially for platforming games like He-Man and the like.<br /><br />The controller looks great out of the box, feels comfortable and small enough to be considered portable, it is not bulky at all. It comes with a small pouch so you can keep it there and bring it around.<br /><br />So how did the SteelSeries controller perform? It was excellent! Out of the box all I did was plug it into my PC to charge the battery, then turned it on (A+B for iOS devices) and linked it to my phone via Bluetooth connection. The whole process was quite easy and the controller worked seamlessly with 'Temple Run'. Unfortunately, that is the only game from my library that is compatible with the device.<br /><br />See, if you are planning on getting this controller for your mobile devices, make sure to check the list of supported games that is published in the manufacturer's website first (I'd post the links here but Amazon  normally removes those) While there appears to be plenty of supported games, most of them are not games I like or own; even more \\"commercial\\" games like 'Angry birds' and similar are not compatible.<br /><br />The controller can also be used on PCs, I honestly can't comment on this as I already own a Logitech remote (which I rarely use when playing games in the computer); for my original purpose, which was to use this with mobile devices, this controller will just not work.<br /><br />Add to that the elevated price tag and I could not really recommend this, it is a shame because the controller looks so well made and performs great, and it will end up stored in a drawer. Even if you are planning to use this on a computer, there are better (and cheaper) options out there.
B003QF8E4A|4.0|This movie is a very tense and thrilling right from the beginning. It makes you wonder who he really was, and whether he was a patient or people were all faking. I enjoyed it.
B00BNPUA5Q|2.0|Purchased this app and love it except no widgets or plugins work tells me its changed and I need to get it again what crap not paying for it twice. Contacted the maker and got a return telling me they are on vacation. ..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is on my new Kindle Fire HD and I use it almost every single day.  It's practical and fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great sequel to the Hunger Games. Surprises, tension, and plot turns are good. I had trouble putting it down. I will definitely read the last book!
0307891372|5.0|there is no way to get the complete story behind everything that is available for this game without buying this guide. my only complaint is that they dont issue online updates when it comes to glitches and add-on downloadable content.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|I love all the BBC Earth productions with David Attenborough. The filming in this series does not disappoint in quality. I don't much care for the stories themselves compared to the ones in Planet Earth, Blue Planet, or Frozen Planet. I know their intention on this one wasn't to be like the other ones, but still I expect better stories. It's still a pleasure to watch ocassionally.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorite movies and we got it for a good price.  The movie DVD is in good shape and it was delivered quickly.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Love it and love the extend material, I am curious how they are going to stretch it into three total movies, but hey at least we get more Middle Earth because I doubt there will be anymore after this ever.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This is review #508. If you've read this far, your eyes are probably really bloodshot so I'll keep my comments brief.<br /><br />Here are two reasons I enjoyed and recommend Zero Dark Thirty:<br /><br />1) The understated acting. This story tells itself, and the director wisely keeps the cast from getting in the way.<br /><br />2)  Ugliness where ugliness is due.  The lead actress aside, there is nothing pretty about this picture, not the CIA interrogators, not the detainees, not the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound, and certainly not the freshly extinguished corpse of Bin Laden himself.  Zero Dark Thirty simply depicts what as done in our name and allows the viewer to decide for himself whether the end justified the means.
B008Y778ZG|4.0|Didn't watch for plot, becuse there aint one, but it is fun disaster porn! If stuff blowing up and breaking is entertainingg then you will enjoy watching this while you surf on your laptop.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I found this book so heartbreaking. Unbelievable to know that this happened to people.<br />I could not put it down.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love every book in this trilogy I have read them three times and I would read them over and over again :)
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is my comfort book. Always cheer me up when I need a little lift from my daily stress!
B00138EV8U|5.0|I just love this music to exercise on the nature trail.It also gives me hope love is still out there somewhere for me lol....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome. it entertains me a lot which is not easy and fun to accomplish. I would let my baby sister play this game if it were up to me. I adore this game.
0689853491|5.0|We just read this last night with my 9 month old and 2 year old.  My baby loved the rhythm and knee-bouncing that went with the fun sounds as you travel through the grass, mud, etc. in the book.  My toddler loved it and requested it again today.  Having only heard it once, he knew the repetitive parts (left sides of the page) and was able to join in \\"reading\\" it.  It's a cute story--need I give you a spoiler alert when it's a very short children's book?--and the fact that they go on a bear hunt, find a bear, and run from it made me laugh, too, when we got to the end.  This is a great little book.
B000E5KJFC|1.0|This would have been great if it had worked when I received it but I did receive my money back so all is right in the world I guess.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoy the historical narrative of the book. the mixing of fiction and non-fiction is entertaining. I would prefer less explicit sexual content and do not see that it adds anything to the storyline.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really good fun, it's interesting because every month or so they change the place round so one month its new York and the next its Rio! Its a good game for long car journeys and very similar to temple run! Recommended.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|i bought this because my classic canon dslr backpack were stolen, so ive started again, its better padded, and have some very nice improvements in comparison with the canon, like the clips on the side for the tripod, yei!!! thumbs up for that!, its smaller, right know i have in there a 160leds video light, canon 6d w/ 24-105mm & hood with battery grip, 50mm 1.4, yongnuo 565, yongnuo transcievers 2x, a mini diana.<br /><br />Certainly the equipment feel tight, it should be a little more taller so the top of the body were more protected. Feels good, high quality fabrics, maybe the zippers feel cheap.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|What Mastery!  This is my now my favorite movie.  Sensory, Perception, Reality, Emotional, Physical, Psychological and Spiritual. So many levels to see in just one life.  Truth is stranger than Fiction!!!!  God Bless Us All, Ellie Kiesling
B004T4KKSA|5.0|I took this out of the library because my financial advisor recommended it.  It's long, but absolutely PACKED with events.  Altho I'm retired and not terribly interested in anything too complicated to read, I could not put this down.  Was so impressed with it, I bought a copy and am now re-reading the second time 6 months later and getting more out of it as I re-read.  This book completely changes both my understanding the history of  the US and international relations for the last 150 years AND how I am investing.  Outstanding book, I recommend without reservation.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|This movie was alright. It has some laughs, but it's certainly no Borat or Bruno... The movie definitely hits you with some wackiness that will score some laughs, but I felt like it was holding back a little. The movie is more in line of Ali G (much more scripted/with a focused story-line) then it is of Borat or Bruno(with their more mockumentary type setup) but it still has some good comedy.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, Saddam Hussein, or Dictators - it'll be worth checking out for the cliches and references... If neither Cohen or Dictators interest you... You may want to skip this one.
1601254679|5.0|Absolutely recommended, it's a life saver for GM's with NPCs for all levels of play. And some of them are really intriguing. Art is superb too!
1432794426|5.0|This book throws much light on all aspects of Michael Jackson's life - it is really an eye opener. We pray with books like this one that people will finally see the truth about him and what his life represented. Not sensational like the gossip columns, but an honest look at all areas of his life including behind the scenes, carefully researched by the author Karen Moriarty. His warmth, humility and gentle spirit shine through the pages. Tom Mesereau has been a hero in Michael's life, and the fact that he endorses this book is the highest accolade indeed. I think it's time the world saw the real man that was Michael Jackson, rather than the caricature portrayed by the press. Reading this will go a long way towards putting things right. In addition, the book gives much information on this complex and thoughtful man, especially about his final years which I had not been aware of before. Thank you Karen Moriarty for this gift of a book!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I was surprised by this film.  I did not have particularly high expectations for this movie, but it was excellent and a lot of fun to watch.  I highly recommend it.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Action packed from beginning to end. Ben Affleck did a great job, so did Jeremy and the others. I've seen it several times now I'm buying it for my sister.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|Hiromi does it again, putting together challenging music and getting outstanding musicians to play it with her.  She and her partners become the music and provide a wonderful communication of the notes, values, and their chemistry.  Her ability to seemingly handle the keyboard belies the fact that they keys probably breathe a sigh of relief when she is done.  Not only an outstanding technical player, she truly has heart and it comes out in this CD--great supporting musicians too, she builds a team.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great entertaining read.  Relatively quick read, so it's nice if you are looking for a quick distraction.  Truly an imaginative plot, but with real-life implications.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|This was a Christmas purchase, a CD for our son, and it came right on time and in excellent condition.  Talk about Christmas--or any--shopping made easy!  Appreciate your making this a pleasant transaction.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|I suffered through about 1/3 of the movie and turned the television set off.  The movie contents are highly subjective.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I can't believe I could get all of these wonderful stories onto my Kindle for just a couple of dollars!  I was going for one and discovered that all of these were made available to us for so little.  Thank you for making available all this collection for someone who would never be able to afford such a library otherwise.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Forst of all, it was complicated to assemble. The directions were not clear at all. Then, I tried to use the product on about 8 bottles and only got one to cut well. Needless to say this product is receiving a poor rating from me. I actually found that using yarn around the bottle and lighting it worked better than using the poor product.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good eye coordination. Makes you have to think and look to match the tiles. Very interesting. I am enjoying the game very much. Glad I was able to play.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This move was awful and a waste of my time watching. the only reason I finished it (painfully) is that I paid for it.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy and couldn't wait to check it out from the local library (I would've been 96th in line for it). I enjoyed the first two books more than the third book. The second one picked up right where the first left off at. The third one was good, but seemed to be slightly different. I almost wish there was a fourth book in this series, I want more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome<br /><br />minecraft is awsome where the only limit is your imagination.You can build whatever you want.Go wherever you want to go.It is also amazing because you can duplicate.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|it's great! all your pictures and important files everywhere you need them! Total access on the go or at hone.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I decided to watch since I have enjoyed so many other shows on BBC America. It was not what I was expecting but funny and worth viewing none the less. If you enjoy other British shows than this one is worth checking out.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|We love this show. Only now, having watched the 3rd season, are we starting to predict the coming story twists. That has not at all made the show less enjoyable, but more interesting to watch. Great Sci-Fi show.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|fun game. very addictive though you have to watch your resources carefully. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes dinosaurs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is amazing perfectly plotted and highly detailed I would recommend it to anyone who loves murder the hunger games is amazing
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Let me first start off saying that I was one of those movie-goers who had the advantage of seeing Safe Haven on opening night with my husband. Since it's release I have went back two other times to the Cinema because the first go around kept me wanting more. To sum it up, that is exactly what Safe Haven does...it keeps the audience wanting more.<br /><br />  Nicholas Sparks has a way of pulling the heart strings of young adult readers world wide and when one of his books hits the Cinema you better watch out for a stampede of avid book worms alike. The chemistry between Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel is intoxicating! You are immediately swept off your feet with Southport, North Carolina and the charm of it's close knit community. The musical score of the movie is superb. Blending seamlessly throughout the picture and leaving you humming the quaint tunes out of the theater.<br /><br />  I won't go into the story line as other reviews had. But,I would say to give this movie an honest chance. It has real heart and is definitely a suspenseful chick flick that makes even the male audience intrigued.
0743486285|5.0|I can't even imagine why anyone would want to put themselves through this! If you were even thinking about trying Heroin read this I would hope it changes your mind!
B006YB9VJU|3.0|My Xperia TL just upgraded to &#34;Smart Connect.&#34; SInce that time, I have to engage my app, turn on the chosen smart tag profile, then touch the Smart Tag.  So much for convenience. It's still faster than having to go through the motions for the changes manually, but it certainly isn't very smart.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Have only been using for a few weeks, but am very satisfied so far. For the price, can't go wrong.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|The case is waterproof.  I did follow directions for checking that out.  Tight charger opening.  A little getting used to.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy this game because it allows me the opportunity to play with others or by myself and it moves fast
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This is a great movie whether or not you are familiar with the Halo mythos.  If you are familiar, the added depth makes it even better.<br /><br />As a warning, it was initially released as several ~20min webisodes, so the transition from one episode to the next is sometimes obvious but that is no big deal.  This release ties them all together into one 90 minute movie length feature with some extra content added in.  It really is top notch.<br /><br />Forward Unto Dawn gives me great hope that other video games can get proper movie adaptations.  Just as comic adaptations went through the growing pains of horrible cash grab, crapfests before becoming one of the dominant (at least in popular opinion) genres of the day, I believe that this is the first step in that direction for video games (okay, maybe Super Mario Bros. the movie was the first step. J/K)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love this game.  told all my friends playing it.  need more games like this.<br />the graphics and style is awesome
B005LAII80|4.0|When I first saw the adds for this, I was skeptical, especially when remembering the old Stallone movie.<br /><br />Forget Stallone, Karl Urban finally does justice to this icon.  All camp has been tossed out and replaced by an edge of your seat, ultra-violent, action fest not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />This movie is maybe the best adaptation of a comic I have seen yet, having gotten the tone and setting perfectly, as well has capturing that feeling of this being just another day in mega city one.<br /><br />If you were on the fence about this movie, give it a chance, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was never a person who enjoyed reading...but I found I couldn't stop I had to keep reading to see what was going to happen next! I am so glad Peers and Katnis ended up together!
0785165975|5.0|Definitely not a comic for the kids.  If you liked kick-ass (the movie or the comic) then you will love Hit-Girl.  This comic has a great pace, great art by John Romita Jr. and as always a great story by Mark Millar.<br /><br />As you might have guessed, it follows Hit-Girl (aka Mindy McCready) in the events shortly after the first Kick-ass novel.  Without giving any spoilers, it is the story of Mindy trying to live a normal life for her mother's sake.  Seeing her struggle to fit in at school just like any other kid her age is great and adds to the dimensionality of this character.<br /><br />Don't worry though - there is still plenty of Hit-Girl kicking ass.
1616550414|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I am a big Zelda fan, so when I heard that this was coming to the United States, I knew I wanted to get it as soon as I could.  I personally enjoyed the concept art and the little notes that were scrawled about certain characters before they were finalized, and even some that didn't make it into the game.  It's also cool to have the Zelda timeline on paper.<br /><br />My main gripe is with Amazon, as there was a big gash on the front cover from an exacto knife or something like that.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is an awesome book.  Plus, for the $20 price tag I got it for, it is an amazing value.
0307887448|5.0|Without giving any spoilers, this is a great book.  It takes place in a bleak near future, is filled with 80's/90's references and is in large part based in a fantasy/scifi computer game.  Oh, and it is a coming of age story.  If any of these topics interests you, then you will probably love this book too.<br /><br />Over the last year I've bought several copies of this for friends and family and have yet to hear of anyone being disappointed. In fact, several people I know have read it and loved it that I never would have guessed.<br /><br />Again, if any of the aforementioned topics are up you're alley, and particularly if you love lots of the cult classics from the 80s like breakfast club, highlander, legend and more you will love this book.
B00C1E8E7E|5.0|To be honest, I didn't expect much going in. I loved Bastard and Goblin so I really didn't think Tyler could avoid a sophomore slump. Artists often talk about how every album they release is their \\"best work,\\" so I didn't believe it when Tyler said this was his best.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />From clever and honest lyrics to top notch producing, Tyler does it all in Wolf. Tyler does a great job of getting a great supporting cast like Frank Ocean, Pharrell, Earl Sweatshirt and Hodgy Beats among others. He gives casual fans a couple of bangers like Domo23 and Tamale. He gets down and deep with songs like IFHW and 48. He even manages to take a chance to take shots at mainstream artists with Trashwang. Overall, an incredibly strong performance by Tyler and the Odd Future crew

B008IJTFYW|5.0|i love the sounds.  i love that you can combine different sounds together  the wind chimes with the water is very soothing
B000FA5SMK|3.0|Could have been two hundred pages shorter. Part of it seemed like it was written by someone else.  Do these Corey novels get better, or is this the top of the heap?
B004SIP7US|5.0|Everything works great, look really clear in hd and the sound its good, and its not expensive also the movie itself its awesome.

1423140591|5.0|Heroes of Olympus, The Son of Neptune is a book about Greek mythology and Roman mythology all in one. It is my favorite book I have read so far because it is full of adventures and action. The author of this book is a man by the name of Rick Riordon. You may have heard of him because he is the author of many books.<br /><br />  This book is supposed to take place in Manhattan, New York in modern times. The people the story is about are: Jason Grace, son of Zeus, Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon, Annabeth, daughter  of Athena, Leo, son of Hephaestus , Piper, daughter of Aphrodite, Frank, son of Ares, and Hazel, daughter of Hades. All of these people are demi gods, who are sons and daughters of the Greek and Roman Gods.<br /><br />  The Son of Neptune is about the Greeks and the Romans trying to come together to form an alliance, but now Percy Jackson and Jason Grace are yanked from their camps, wiped clean of their memory and put back in the wrong camps. Queen Hera of Olympus did that on purpose thinking it would help them form the alliance. Now Percy and Jason have to find their camps, take back their memory, free Queen Hera (who is captured by the evil goddess, Gaea), defeat the Titan Giant, save their camps, and fight the enemy's army before the goddess Gaea awakes. There is certainly no time to sit around and twiddle their thumbs!<br /><br />  This book is filled with excitement and I definitely think you should read it if you are a fan of Greek or Roman mythology. This book makes me feel like I am a part of the story, and it makes me want to go outside and either find Camp Half Blood, or go kill some monsters.  By Trinity, age 11
B00865P3AS|3.0|We loved the first cd; my kids, 7 and 11 were amazed by the sound coming from just 2 cellos. They each have their favorites from that album. In2ition has some songs with singers (which I kind of like) and one has percussion which as many times as I've listened to it I just do not enjoy. The other songs are fantastic as expected.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I got this on sale for my Kindle, based on reviews. Some readers had a difficult time with the chapters going back and forth between the present and 2003, but it was done beautifully and clearly in my opinion. Each chapter has the date at the top so there's no confusion.<br /><br />There were times during the book when I had to put it down for sheer terror of what would happen next. My heart pounded, fear coursed through me, and I wasn't sure I could continue. But the story is so intriguing that despite my cowardly moments I had to see what happened next. Ms Haynes is able to immerse the reader into the story so completely that it felt almost as if I was there, and I felt the heroine's anguish. Thank heavens, Ms Haynes was also wise enough to intersperse the terrifying chapters with more sane moments so that it was never really too much to bear.<br /><br />I will definitely look for this author's future works.
B00B6OEDS4|1.0|Badly written, obscure plot, uninteresting characters, this book has nothing to commend it unless you are seeking a grope and squeeze novel that is exploitation at its most salacious.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|While the acting is exceptional, the movie LINCOLN seems to drag along with very little excitement. I wouldn't recommend it for the casual viewer.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I rented this movie because I thought since Jennifer Lawrence was starring, it would be great. It was okay, but not nearly as good as I expected.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|for some reason it wont let me get on multiplayee Cu's it supposedly States that my Internet doesn't work wen in fact it does work. dunno if this is a bug or something but pls fix and help
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I had to convince my teenage son to watch this movie with me, but we both enjoyed it so much! This is a feel-good movie for sure!
0062238868|5.0|It is refreshing to read Chris Kyle's experience as a Navy Seal Sniper because his account is humble, straight forward, with no apologies.  He does not pad his story-he states it as he experienced it<br />Chris weaves his personal life experiences and spiritual path in the book which gives the reader a deeper look at the man behind the rifle.  One gets a sense that this is a very steady, balanced individual.  He does admit the war changed him, but it did not change his core being.  He remains true to himself and is steadfast towards his relationship with his faith.<br />Real men are quiet beings.
