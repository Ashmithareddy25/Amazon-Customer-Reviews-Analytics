B000002A3T|5.0|Obviously after the departure of Roger Waters and Syd Barret (long ago), it would seem that Pink Floyd would not last long.  Wrong idea.  Not a solo album of Gilmour's but a compilation from Wright, Gilmour, and Mason, Division Bell looks back on life in a Floydian-style and has almost a philisophical meaning in it the whole time.<BR>  If you've ever thought you heard words in Joe Walch's guitar in &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot; or &quot;Those Shoes&quot; you'll hear what Gilmour's 'says' in Division Bell.  While a man slips out of consciousness in &quot;Keep Talking&quot;, all that is left is Gimour's guitar speaking for him.<BR>  I would look to see who the producers are (probably Gilmour and the rest of the trio) but I don't know where my case is, but anyway, the producers should get an award for this album.
B00005B36H|5.0|...let me tell you about their sound. You are not likely to hear a Tool song being blasted during spring break. They are not a mainstream band, and as such are like nothing on the radio right now. And that is part of their appeal: originality. ... To experience Lateralus the way it was meant to be, you should listen to it all they way through numerous times, and then it will dawn on you-this is something special. Every member of Tool is an extraordinary talent by themselves, but together they are astounding. Probably the first thing you will notice is that the vocals are pushed back, leaving the instruments in the forefront. This may seam odd at first, but give it time, and you won't even notice. <BR>This album is an absolute work of art, and when you compare it to most anything in the mainstream, you will say \\"wow,\\" because it is better than anything out there now or before. BUY IT!
B00004Y7SF|3.0|If I weren't a nice guy, I'd say something like \\"I'd feel silly playing a Christmas record in October(in order to review it), but I don't think anyone hearing me play it realized it was a Christmas record.\\"<br />Or, if I weren't a nice guy, I might say:  \\"This is a great record to have on hand at your Christmas party!  You can put it on when you want everyone to go home!\\"<br />But I'm a nice guy, so I wouldn't say those things.  I will say, though, that with all of the stories going around about Christina, her Christmas record probably isn't the currently hottest topic for conversation!<br />And I will say that I believe she's wasting a voice with a terrific range with the yelling and screaming.  There are points in this record where she shows (for a few seconds) that she's capable of using her voice in a well modulated and very effective way.  <br />However, she knows how to please a certain audience that has the money to buy her CDs.  Unfortunately, right about now, there are probably hundreds if not thousands of Moms forbidding members of that audience from buying her new \\"Stripped\\" CD, or maybe any of her CDs, since Christina isn't quite measuring up to be a role model as far as parents are concerned.  On the other hand, one has to have a certain admiration for a celebrity who insists on being absolutely the person she is.<br />As far as this specific CD goes, I just don't feel there is any kind of Christmas spirit here, even when making all kinds of allowances for the music genre.  If you can find it though, be my guest and enjoy it!<br />Out of respect for the fact that Christina does know how to make her fans happy, and she has a large audience, I will allow this three stars.  I will not trash her just because of my personal opinion of the way she's using (or misusing) her natural talent.  And I will point out that there are moments of \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" that give one a taste of what she could do with her voice if she wanted to.
B00006IU73|2.0|Porcupine Tree finally has made it to the major leagues, and the technical side of &quot;In Absentia&quot; reflects that.  The sound is crisp and booming (credit engineer Paul Northfield), but the soul is missing from the songs.<br />It appears that Steven Wilson has had a field day in the studio, for every track on &quot;In Absentia&quot; is littered with excessive effects.  (The tired &quot;voice on the telephone line&quot; effect is used on at least three songs alone!)  The effects detract from anything that Steven Wilson might be trying to say -- either lyrically or musically.<br />If you're new to Porcupine Tree, check out &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; or &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; for the band's melodic side and &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot; for their prog side instead.
0064471837|5.0|Nix does a very good job with this book.  It has all of the elements of a really good book: imagination, a touch of mystery, romance, comic relief and a lot of action.<br />The charactors are really well developed, and the information all makes sense.  There is a ton of creativity in this book, and I think that it is good for students and all sorts of people to get veiws on foreign fantasy and sci-fi.<br />This is a good example of just that.  Very good plot.
B000000OF6|5.0|It's hard to imagine a set more appropriately deserving that moniker than this one.  Jam-packed with all of Queen's big hits and many that should have been big hits, this set is indeed worth its weight in gold (get it?).  We all know the big hits of the Queen catalogue, but what is really great about this set are the many great songs that never get any exposure such as &quot;Who Wants To Live Forever&quot; (one of their most powerful tunes ever), &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; (with all of the arena rock bombast you've come to expect from this band), the awesome rocker &quot;Innuendo&quot; from the album of the same title (listen to that flamenco-style playing!), and &quot;Headlong&quot;, another great rocker.  The rest is, as they say, history.  I have never regretted purchasing this set.  I see that there is a new 'platinum box set' containing all of this material and a third disc.  This is the better deal considering that the third disc is mainly leftovers and bizarre remixes.<br />Essential.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|I have every cd that Sade has ever put out. I was upset when I missed her coming in the Washington, DC area two years ago. The CD made up for the loss. The CD is a must have. I rated it four stars because of the background noise from the audience. But overall, the CD is Bangin!<br />The sweetest taboo is back! you go girl!!
B000002BSG|3.0|TRAVELLING WITHOUT MOVING was massively hyped and won some major awards I believe. It is a healthy mix of r&b soul funk dance house and disco. I like half of this album at most. The opener is great and I also like the slow funk instrumental. Most of the rest sounds like too conscious an attempt to be retro and sound 70's. These guys are really trying to be 'hip' and it's not working for me. It's just too much. It would be fine if the songs were actually compelling, but most of them are not. Pretty dull in my opinion. Bright moments shine thru, but not enough for me to recommend this album.  On the technical side, I LOVE the mix-especially the bass and drums.  They sound great.  Listen to that kick drum!  Mmm mmm.  I do agree with another reviewer who wrote that this is much better than listening to headache-inducing techno music.  Perhaps a collection drawing from all of their albums would be more pleasing?

0812532538|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a book about a young boy who is a genius among geniuses. It is an incredible book that makes you use your imagination. You can not seem to put it down. Many times at night while I was reading this book I was forced to stay up and read more. I just kept telling myself one more chapter, one more chapter, and eventually it was over! I have read it numereous times and still have not found it boring. I always spot things I have missed the first time. So everytime I read this I look forward to finding new things that I did not get before or just did not see. Every page is something new and exciting. There are always new challenges for Ender to overcome and it makes it just that much more exciting. You always have to finish up the chapter before you can put it down. If you neeed a book to read and want it to be exciting I highly suggest this one its interesting from beggining to end.
0312265859|5.0|I couldn't wait for  \\"Hard Eight\\" by Janet Evanovich. This, her latest novel is her best, but then I've said that about each one. After starting in the middle of her then seven book series, I quickly read through all the rest, Starting with \\"One for the Money.\\" No matter how I tried, I could not delay gratification. <BR> But, back to \\"Hard Eight,\\" latest in the Stephanie Plum series. Stephanie is Jersey girl who has taken a job with her cousin Vinnie as a bond enforcement agent AKA, bounty hunter. She tracks down and apprehends people who have failed to meet their court dates. This way, cousin Vinnie won't lose the bond money that he has put up for them and, he gratefully pays Stephanie 15% of the total bond amount for her work.<BR> Evanovich not only takes you behind the scenes of the Bail Bond Business, she takes you to Trenton, New Jersey....where Pizza is still called Tomato Pie, where death cooties linger long after the body is removed, and where people follow Jersey rules. For example, if you're sitting in front of the TV, you aren't expected to talk. \\"Even if asked a direct question, the viewer has the discretion of feigning hearing loss\\".  <BR>She also takes you into the lives Stephanie's family and friends. While I'm not a hyphenated American, I do have a rich ethnicity and I feel sorry for anyone who has not experienced real life people like the ones who live in the Burg. This Hungarian Goulash/Mulligan stew section where the lines of ethnicity have become dulled over years of people intermarrying because they never move more than 5 miles from where they were born!<BR> Evanovich's insight into these culturally diversified players can only come from first hand experience. Stephanie observes: \\"I'm not great with big displays of emotion. My mother and I expressed affection through veiled compliments about gravy.\\" <BR> And, Mothers in the Burg have never heard that you shouldn't compare your children to each other. Stephanie's mom says things like, \\"Why can'tyou have a normal job like your sister?\\" Stephanie thinks to herself, \\"Yeah, and last year she decided to be a lesbian and now she's dating a loser lawyer who looks like the Pilsbury Dough Boy.\\"<BR> Neighbors in the Burg never let you leave without serving you coffee cake, often homemade. Her parents' neighbor, Mabel Markowitz, \\"lives in a museum.\\"  She goes on, \\"Mabel married in 1943 and still has her first table lamp, her first pot, her first chrome-and-Formica kitchen table. Her living room was newly wallpapered in 1957.  The upholstered pieces sag slightly in the middle, imprinted with asses that have since moved on...either to God or Hamilton Township.\\"<BR> Mabel is the one who involves Stephanie in this latest adventure. Her granddaughter, Evelyn and her child, Alice, have disappeared and Mabel is worried that something has happened to them since Evelyn and her husband were recently involved in an ugly divorce. <BR> So, kind-hearted Stephanie is off to find the missing family members, which she thinks, shouldn't be too hard because everyone knows everyone in the Burg and how far could a woman with no money get with a kid in tow?<BR> But, if you know Stephanie, nothing is ever simple. In her quest, she becomes the victim of a sadistic stalker who is somehow involved with the missing woman's ex-husband. And, since she's doing this missing person's job for free, she still needs to go after Vinnie's bad guys to put Tasteykakes on the table.  Seldom are Stephanie's pick-ups a slam-dunk.<br /> Same with her love life, it `s on hold most of the time. She really likes Joe Morelli, her longtime friend and sometime boyfriend. He's a cop now but \\"they met as kids when he started looking up her skirt and never gotten out of the habit.\\" He would even marry her, if she'd get a normal job.<BR> Then there's the dark, mysterious Ranger, a gorgeous hunk who is always around to help Stephanie move her cases forward and to set her heart to fluttering. She calls him Batman becausehe has a way of appearing out of nowhere.<BR> Through all of this, the loose ends are tied up, the bad guys get theirs, and we're left waiting for  #9.<BR> If you get the idea that I love this book, you're right. In the language of the Burg, \\"Hard Eight\\" by Janet Evanovich gets a Freakin' A.
0671042858|3.0|While this is not a bad book, it is most certainly not in keeping with what most would expect from a Stephen King book.  It is lacking in horror, suspense and drama.  Truly not what a true King buff would read were it not for having his name on it.  It was disappointing to say the least.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement threw every notion of what makes good pop-music out the window and came up aces every damn time. &quot;Slanted &amp; Enchanted&quot; was their ransom note. The Beatles played through a voice scrambler. &quot;Give me back my son!&quot; said Mel Gibson in &quot;Ransom&quot;. Upon hearing this album, so too will you.
1860467636|4.0|It's summer in Sweden, which is a very inconvenient time for a serial killer to start working. Wallander has planned a vacation with the new woman in his life, but his troubles begin when a mysterious girl kills herself in front of him and they continue when notable men start turning up dead and scalped.<br /><br />You know very early on in _Sidetracked_ who did what to whom, the book is not about shocker endings as much as it is about normal police work generating results. One of the nice thing about Wallander as a detective is that his guesses are often wrong-- one of the clear points being made in the book is that the detective job is not about hunches, but about research, people skills, and hard work.<br /><br />A lot of the reviewers have made the comparison with Wahloo, but myself I was brought more to mind of Freeling's Castang mysteries. But a fine book indeed, to be compared with the work of either writer.
B00005JKG9|5.0|What can I write other than superb. With an outstanding cast and brilliant storyline, It would've been a failure had it been average.With great writing and explosive acting, it has been one of my favorite films ever. Jack Lemmon's performance will go down as one of the best ever, he absolutely nails it! Lemmon has many accolades in his vast wealth of screen work, but It is nothing short of ridiculous that he did not win an oscar for this role (Hollywood elected a trendier actor).Watch the film and enjoy the emotional roller coaster that all of these accomplished actors take you on. <BR>                                           Scott
0151008116|4.0|I would give it 4 and 3/4 stars actually.  I was a little let down by the ending, but I wholeheartedly enjoyed the journey and would definitely recommend the book to friends.  It was an amazing and well-written story and it challenges the reader to think.
B000056N8X|1.0|This movie is literally a slap in the face of all the fan's of both the original 3 films and the television series. The franchise seriously bilked the fan's on this one, and only put the film out to bring in some money and temporarily float an already sinking ship. The producers of Highlander, indeed all the staff (actors, writers, et al) who took part in this farce are all complete sell outs.<br />This movie does not fit with the series, it doesn't fit with any of the previous films. The second movie fits with one of the other films or series. The third movie is a cheap clone of the first movie and doesn't fit with the series either. Need I say more? It's only called Highlander because if the characters had different names and the title was changed, nobody would ever see this garbage. This is a horrible kick in the teeth to hardcore fan's who hoped and prayed that this film would be the ending we all deserved to 6 years of watching the series.<br />Shame on the producers for serving up this pile of filth in place of a real film. I hear rumors of a part V, but I hope that never materializes. The franchise has violated their fan's enough and I for one am still sore.<br />Stay away from this less-than-B movie and spend your money on something worthwhile.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is not an easy album, and anyone planning to listen to it once and \\"understand\\" it is likely to be dissapointed. At first, I thought it was a bit too claustrophobic, but there's an elegance to it, even a trancendance in the lines \\"for a minute there/ I lost myself\\" from Karma Police. The key, for me at least, is that it grows with and on you. I bought this as soon as it came out and I still listen to it (so much so that I own 3 copies). That's about the highest praise I can give.
B00005ASHM|5.0|All my life, I've known about this album and that it had influenced many successful artists however, I'd never heared it.<BR>           I had heard 'Wouldn't it be nice' and 'God Only Knows' before but never in the album's context. I am inthralled by Wilson's understanding of harmony and the timbres which he uses on this album. (what the heck are those flippity-flop sounds on God Only Knows for example.) Also what I find amazing is how the Beach Boys recorded such a beautiful album without being reduced to tears. I can't hold a conversation even during 'Wouldn't it be nice' for my voice becomes a quaver.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album really pushed Nirvana over the top and is outstanding.  It changed the way music sounded for the rest of the 1990's.  Smells like teen spirit\\" was angry, brilliant, and will always be a classic, much like this ablum.
B00005JKG7|5.0|The sleepy seaside village of Antonio Bay, California, is about to learn the true meaning of the word \\"vengeance\\". For this seemingly perfect town masks a guilty secret - a past steeped in greed and murder. Exactly one hundred years ago, the treasure ship \\"Elizabeth Dane\\" was horribly wrecked in a thick, eerie fog under mysterious circumstances. Now, shrouded in mist, the long-dead mariners have returned from their watery grave to exact a bloody revenge.Can this waking nightmare be stopped, or will the fog keep rolling in...to kill and kill again?<BR>Between midnight and one...it will find you! Lock your doors!<br />The fog - starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, John Houseman and Hal Holbrock as Father Malone.<br />From the master of horror - John Carpenter.
B00005Y7NK|3.0|I've had this album for about a month now, and it was worth the money! This has to be the darkest album Sabbath ever did! The opening trak, \\"Gates of Hell,\\" sends chills down your spine. The title track is slow and compelling. Tony Martin's voice sends waves of inspiration toward the listener, telling you that he is for real. \\"Devil & Daughter\\" is my favorite track, with Cozy Powell's drums pounding at full force. The errie \\"When Death Calls\\" takes the album deeper into the realm of the unknown. \\"Kill in The Spirit World\\" is as close to glam metal that this album gets. \\"Black Moon\\" is a catchy track that shows the band's talent well. Even though Toney Iommi was the only original member of Black Sabbath by this time, he defineatly shows us that he recycle the other 3 members of the band and still make good music! I'm curious as to how this album, and the other Iommi-only albums of this era did on the charts. Regardless, don't listen to those that think Sabbath died when Ozzy left! Black Sabbath lives on, and this compelling album is a trademark of their career.
B000003TSP|5.0|I have listened to this album and then got to &quot;Dummy&quot;... and I prefer this one much more as I am a lot into &quot;dark&quot; music. For those of you who can't stand it, get Britney's album.

This is one of my top five so far with 2 months to go .<br />Like Peter gabriel &quot;Up&quot; ,Tempano &quot;The agony and the Ecstasy&quot; , and Dream Thetare &quot;Six Degrees of inner turbulence&quot;, Camel has delivered another fantastic CD , very consistent after all this years, if you liked this one , then check out the other band I mentioned here , except for Gabriel , not well known, but must haves in any collection.

B00005YU1O|5.0|As a character in this movie said, often it's very boring to hear about someone else's dream. They often don't make sense to either the dreamer or the victim of the recap, but when you yourself have a dream that bugs you all day, it's almost irresistible to tell others about it. It kind of feels like Rick Linklater, in making a movie like this, found a way to tell us all about some of his dreams, and the dreams of others, but without being boring at all. Far from it, in fact! It's exhilarating!<br />Of course, the movie itself is a dream, a stroll through someone's unconscious. It feels very personal, a feeling enhanced by the director himself appearing at both the beginning and the end ov the movie, almost as a guide both to the main character and to us, the viewers. It's as if Linklater is telling us, &quot;Hey- are dreams cool or what?!&quot; and at the same time showing us the message of his own dream creation. <br />We hear many people talk about their perspectives on reality, consciousness, and life in general, and this makes us feel like one of them, because we all wonder about these things from time to time. Any movie that can remind people that they are not alone in this world (without being smarmy) is a success in my book. Everyone has dreams, and this mere fact makes the movie work, because it appeals to a side of all of us. Not only that, it introduces the concept of lucid dreaming to anyone not already familiar with it. <br />This review is not a plot summary. To try that would be futile, because I'd only focus on the stuff I thought was cool. It's like a collection of seeds for each of us to sort through at leisure and cultivate on our own, and this very process makes it a unique and personal experience for everyone that sees it.<br />After seeing this movie, I began writing my dreams down, because I was so excited at the prospect of being able to control my own dreams. And any movie that inspires something like that in me is also a success in my book!See it and you won't be sorry!
0783231032|5.0|Spectacular is certainly the word for this utterly wild comedy epic directed by Steven Spielberg and nominated for 3 Academy Awards. Lavish effects sequences highlight this hilarious, all-star extravaganza set in Los Angeles just days after the attack on Pearl Harbor,when fear of a japanese invasion threw the city into a state of Pandemonium. Screwball characters run wild on Hollywood Boulevard as manic servicemen, zealous store owners, teary-eyed girls and bickering nazis are thrown together in this fast-rising comic soufflé that even features a sendup of Spielberg`s own &#34;Jaws&#34; opening.

B000002AGM|4.0|Although this is credited as a Miles Davis album, \\"Miles Ahead\\" is really a full collaboration between the talented trumpeter and composer Gil Evans. Utilizing a 19-piece orchestra, this fine recording shows Davis at his most focused, accentuating the lovely arrangements Evans provides. These tracks burst with energy and verve; it's almost as if Davis is \\"speaking\\" through these compositons with his trumpet. I really liked the rush of \\"Springsville,\\" the suave charm of \\"The Duke,\\" and New Rhumba. From track to track, you can witness the potent chemistry between these two. While \\"Miles Ahead\\" isn't among my very favorites by Miles, it's still a terrific display of the talents of this legendary jazz great. Get a latte, grab a couch and crank up the volume on your stereo. Definitely recommended.
B00006IUIG|3.0|First off, its one of the 10 greatest movies.  If you have any interest in the history of cinema, its a must-view.  However, the Image Entertainment single disc edition suffers from a decent transfer of a mediocre print, with much distracting dust and emulsion chipping present.  The Criterion 2 disc version, while weighed down by a second disc of less interesting documentaries issue appears to have far fewer print defects.  IMHO the commentaries and better transfer make the Criterion disc a better purchase.

B00006JLX4|5.0|I love Pavement, and I love this album. But it's also my least favorite of all of their albums... they improved with each release. <BR>If you're new to Pavement and want to know where to start ask yourself this: do I like rock music that is wonderful and is lo-fi and a little abbrasive? If yes, start with Slanted and Enchanted (and this rerelease). If you prefer rock music that is wonderful, and a little more accessible and cleaner, get any other Pavement release. They're all really great.<br />And what about those familiar with Pavement? Well, those people must buy this album. It's great! All of the B-sides and live tracks are at least as good as anything that ever made the real album (which is really rare for these types of collections). The John Peel sessions are essential, and the forty minute live show is blessed with clean sound and has the band in fine form and playing with incredible energy.<br />I know this review is a bit brief and to the point (if I had the time I'd do a song by song review of each track) but just know that this isn't some thrown together collection; this is a beautifully compiled historical document of the band's lo-fi days, with unreleased material that actually ranks along with the band's best.
B000002JSJ|5.0|\\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\\" was the first song I ever heard on FM radio. The twisted intro, the start/stop structure, the drugged-out desperation of the vocals changed my life. This is the last Zeppelin album (\\"In through the out door\\" sounds more like a scratchy phonecall from beyond the grave). The riffs are kickin, the solos are out, the lyrics are trippy. This is the sound of battle-scarred psychic war veterans wading once more into the breach to shatter skulls and sever limbs. They were masters, once. Page smokes every rock guitarist who isn't Hendrix. Without being a metal band, this album demonstrates the debt that entire genre owes them and reminds us how one-dimensional Sabbath were (though, as Paranoid demonstrated, that one dimension was incredibly rich). Although the pacing of this album is wierd (kicking off with the epic \\"Achilles\\"), it actually works (in a way it doesn't on \\"Houses of the Holy,\\" for example). No contemporary hard rock band has created an album (or even a single song) as enduring and epoch-making as this.
B000002I53|5.0|If it weren't for my late father, a passionate lover of jazz, chances are I would never have bothered with John Coltrane--and quite possibly the whole genre altogether.  If &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; and &quot;Blue Train&quot; are two of this saxaphonist's best albums, then &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; has to rank a close third.  Never before have I heard such a lovely reinterpretation of the classic title song as performed by Coltrane.  His warm and inviting sax glides with ease through this 13 minute piece, which is also highlighted by the excellent piano work of McCoy Tyner.  The lively &quot;Summertime&quot; is just flat-out perfect and shows Coltrane at his most expressive and skillful, and the bass and drums, from Steve Davis and Elvin Jones respectively, blend nicely into the mix.  &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; is a classy and elegant CD that's required listening for anyone who is into jazz and also interested in this incredibly talented saxaphonist.
B000006TRV|5.0|As Floyd steps up to bat the guys deliver an awesome ballad with metal guitar's blaring, \\"In the Flesh\\". And moves into the next cut with a baby crying which fits perfectly with the first lyric about Syd Barrett's (lead singer) baby. Its amazing what this band can produce when giving you a song like \\"Another Brick in Wall Part 1 and 2\\" which is the most catchy tune on the record and will leave you singing it all day. One of the reasons why this song has appealed to all audiences because of the repetitive chorus about not needing to go to school. It's a clever combination of children and an outstanding rock song. <BR>Then, the album takes a left turn, leading into a hippie peace song, \\"mother\\". This is the most significant transition on the album because it doesn't contain an intro like every other song. The album continues with such sound effects such as birds chirping, dial tones, doors slamming and gun shots. <BR>The most amazing song on the CD is Yong Lust and not just for its dumbfounding guitar riff and solo but because the guy is singing about needing a dirty woman to have \\"lustful\\" relationships with. What guy wouldn't want to blare that on his speakers? <BR>On another cut the band claims \\"the show must go on\\" in acapella, which leads right into the reprise of \\"in the flesh\\". The amazing masterpiece ends with Barrett speaking \\"Outside the Wall\\" as a choir sings in the background what he his saying. This album displays instrumentation of using an orchestra and using keyboard like melodies. The wall is an oceanic, multi-dimensional song cycle that never ends even after you are done listening. The tribal-sparse drums, adds a lot to the albums veering bass runs but are no match for \\"The Wall's\\" chunks of guitar and deranged lyrics. They toyed with rock using their mighty harmony and interesting and sometimes scary sound effects. <BR>The \\"Pioneers of Rock and Roll\\" delivered a 5 star album and an excellent inspiration to new comers in the industry. \\"The Wall\\" is by far the best Floyd album, by one of the top 10 best bands in the world. Its is a shame that music is not as good as it used to be in the days of Pink Floyd.
B000002H70|5.0|In my opinion Disintegration is by far the best album that has ever been born from Robert Smith's musical genius. I have listened to this album for over ten years without it ever getting old.I love to turn this on full blast and swim within its dark depths, letting its dark waters wash over me in a soothing tranquility. Smith's lyrical acheivements are at its fullest, wallowing in his self pity, in the tragedy of lost love and empty dreams. In this brilliant piece of transcendental artwork, a masterpiece giving the comforting illusion of longevity, a fallacious concrete wall to surround the eternal disintegration of our brief lives the Cure is at their best.<BR>Most of the songs revolve around repetitive drum beats and bass lines, swirling in a explosive passion of mood and depression, giving mental pictures of rainy days, long winters and falling snow upon degenerate graveyards,the taste of a lingering kiss, the sound of tragedy upon your ringing ears, nostalgia of summer sunny days spent dreaming in the slumber of childhood, remembrances of days that will never be held again in the grasp of youth as we continue in our state of entropy toward the inevitable end.<BR>Choice songs: Disintegration, The Same Deep Water As You, Fascination Street, Last Dance, Pictures of You
0441008356|4.0|Reynold's Revelation Space was an interesting story on the way humanity began to evole into a different species through the use of science, though his claim that culture not nature as a vehicle for evolution was unconvincing.  <BR>What I did enjoy was the scope of the plot of his novel that remind me of Isaac Asimnov's &quot;The Foundation Trilogy&quot; or Robert Blumetti's &quot;Ironstorm.&quot;  The galactic scope of the story was well done and believible soaring across time and space.  If you like to read complex stories then I recormend Revelation Space.
0446677450|5.0|It's been drilled into our heads our entire lives...  \\"Work hard, get a good paying job and retire at 65.\\"  I have often asked myself (and sometimes others) why I should have to work for 45 - 50 years, giving someone else the best years of my life?  The answer is always the same...  \\"How will you live/eat/pay for your kids college without a job?\\"   Even asking such a question seems to call for ridicule.  Sometimes I just get empty stares as if I'm outside reality.  I watch these same people stuggling to pay their bills, \\"buying\\" new cars every 2 years, \\"owning\\" the latest and greatest gadgets and gizmos, putting vacations on their credit cards, making well over 6-figures; i.e. \\"enjoying life\\", all the while increasing their debt and enslaving themselves and their families.  This book plus an open mind and action is a way out.  It is not a \\"how-to\\" book, rather it is a basic philosophical examination of what money is, our attitudes towards it, why we entrap ourselves in debt, and how to use money to our advantage.      I wish I had read this book in high school (I would have actually learned something there).
0380789035|2.0|American Gods has an imaginative premise and the writing is fairly good, and I have given it points on that aspect, however one must be well versed in suspension of disbelief in that the characters have little resemblance to real people and the convoluted murkiness of plot requires great perseverance to achieve much reward. While you may gather this sort of story is not my usual cup of tea, I have had others whose opinions I value tell me they enjoyed it immensely, and therefore perused it. I find it always difficult to remain objective when the object of discussion, a book or movie, is experienced in a subjective fashion. My antipathy to this particular novel was engendered rather soon by the protagonist's depiction as an ex-con who seemed emotionally blocked in certain areas and fixated in others, yet for all his pragmatic experiences in prison and solid grounding in reality, he accepted with equanimity the most bizarre turn of events that defied all logic, even if couched in a Lord of the Rings setting. I realize this is a fantasy story, but still, when dealing with humans, one must assume there is such a thing as a normal reaction response to outrageous incidents. Shadow's lack of normal reactions seemed to remove him from concern by the reader, in other words, you just don't care what happens to him. And, while I can accept the conceptual fantasy idea of ancient Gods being worshiped in olden times and other lands and actually living among humans, I find it difficult to rationalize them working in, say, a slaugterhouse stunning cattle or running cheap cons to make a living. Either you are a God or you aren't, and if you are, you should be able to avoid such lowly endeavors no matter how many people still believe you exist, otherwise you're just another mundane human with delusions of grandeur. The powers they retained, while minor, still should have enabled them to move out of the slums. And the new breed, hip-hoppers with a bit of magic, seemed a weak effort. But again, I am not a fan of overly-complicated plots that seem to go nowhere nor accomplish much for the majority of the book, no matter how unique the concept or how well they are written. I feel characters should be somewhat realistic so the reader can relate to them in some small manner.<br />However, that said, if you enjoyed King's Dark Tower books, or even The Stand, then you might also enjoy this novel as it follows the general form quite well, a basic good versus evil premise complete with outrageous and eccentric players as seen through a veil of fog that clouds one's ability to make sense of things -as though Lamont Cranston was hiding behind your Lazy Boy as you read. I occasionally felt somewhat like I had wandered into the Winchester House and climbed a series of stairways that ended nowhere, feeling a momentary pang of regret that Ray Bradbury and Poul Anderson aren't still producing the volumes of quality fantasy they once did.<br />-Barker Reviewsut again, I am not a fan of overly-complicated plots that seem to go nowhere nor accomplish much for the majority of the book, no matter how unique the concept or how well they are written.

B000002UKS|5.0|Sure, the debut by Foo Fighters was punky, spirited, and was crafted into a big wall of sound. THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE is a step above that, carrying more than its fair share with big hooks, more buzzing rock, and improved songwriting. The first single, &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, is one heck of a roller-coaster ride from start to finish, and &quot;Everlong&quot; rocks with a breezy melody. Many people will find &quot;My Hero&quot; an addictive gem, and also &quot;New Way Home&quot; is a splendid closer, showing off the ever-improving guitar work of Dave Grohl. Also worth of mention is the melodic to unabashedly chaotic &quot;My Poor Brain&quot;, and the lilting and gentle one-minute-plus opener &quot;Doll&quot;, which is a really melodic affair from such a rockin' band. <br />THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE really showcases even more of the musical prowess behind Dave Grohl and company. And you know what? It only gets better from here.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Even though I am slightly annoyed with the fact that you have to own a memorycard in order to get the full outcome from you PS2, i think that the memorycard from Sony is very good.<br />The saving and loading of games of games are very fast, and I haven't experienced any problems at all with any of my games. Besides the speed on the memorycard it has plenty of space for lots of savings.<br />Games are so much more fun when you are able to save your progress, so I guess that when you have decided to buy a PS2 you really need a memorycard as well.<br />The only reason that my rating is only four stars is that I think that it should be possible to save games on your PS2 without having a memorycard.
0743442539|5.0|I can say from personal experience that John Le Carre's description of early '60s Cold War Berlin is deadly accurate-- from the feel of the cold rain on cobblestone streets to the tension of waiting at a border checkpoint. <br />Many reviewers have used words like &quot;dreary&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and &quot;bleak&quot; to describe this novel and they are right. The Soviet Zone of Berlin was all of that and more-- a depressing, grey and colorless prison whose inmates lived in constant fear. <br />In those days, East Berliners were afraid to be seen talking to-- or even looking at--an American soldier. For example, they would look only at my reflection in a glass store window-- afraid of being picked up and questioned by the DDR Staats Polezei. Le Carre captures that depressing climate of fear and imparts it to his reader.<br />The 1965 movie of the same name starring Richard Burton also captures this mood. It is not coincidental that it was filmed in Black &amp; White. This medium reinforces the crushing dreariness of East Berlin in 1962. I consider this espionage &quot;film noire&quot; one of the best ever made. <br />On a different plane, I can also recommend the original movie &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot; (not that dreadful remake!) and the book is even better.<br />I think many readers and even editorial reviewers missed an important point-- Alec Leamas was supposed to start drinking and fighting so that he would be arrested-- that was the set-up to make his disaffection with his &quot;former&quot; agency believable to the Staasi. His descent into bitterness and alcoholism was contrived but, like so much of the story, one does not know how much was a sham and how much underlying truth may have been revealed.
6305696071|5.0|The viewer's assignment will be to put away reasoning and suspend belief for 125 minutes to enter that spinner-of-the-make-believe world of Los Angeles.  Specifically seedy Hollywood streets filled with neon lights, drugs, and hookers.  While at the other end of the spectrum, Beverly Hills gleams with the rich and beautiful people roaming Rodeo Drive shops for designer goodies and cavorting on polo fields to stomp down divots kicked up during the rough and tumble of the matches (galloping horses, swinging mallets and all that, you know).<br />It will take great imagination to pretend that Julia Roberts is destined for a sleazy half life as a street walker, sleeping all day before getting up to put on her messy blonde wig and shiny, over-the-knee stiletto boots to claim her territory on the mean streets and wave at the johns.  She dreams of a fairy tale \\"prince charming rescuing beautiful maiden and they live happily ever after\\" but is too busy keeping it together for herself and ditzy roommate, Kit, to have a clue about finding her dream.<br />Enter Edward (Richard Gere):  It's no stretch to make him fit his character.  He is handsome, super rich, successful in business and with a carefully shielded heart that prohibits becoming close to any person because he never lived up to Dad's idea of the 'perfect son'.  Pretend that he'd rather hire a hooker for a week so he can concentrate on business.<br />Now the FUN part begins.  These two meet, a proposition is made, is accepted and Edward turns Vivian loose on Rodeo with his charge card.  The rest of the movie is pure magic.  It's not 'real life' -- it's the movies.  Enjoy it for all that it is.<br />Since I need a touch of 'Fairy Tale' every so often it was a perfect choice to own on DVD.  Favorite supporting characters are: Hector Elizondo who is perfect as Mr. Thompson the hotel manager and Elinor Donahue in a one scene wonder as a gracious, elegant saleswoman.  This 10th Anniversary Edition gives the viewer 15 minutes of extra footage, seamlessly inserted to enhance the story.
B000002TYK|4.0|Dave Grohl went out to prove there is life after Nirvana, and with the debut cd by his band Foo Fighters, it just goes to show how the influence of a once powerful band can influence you. You can just hear the influence of Nirvana's punky-pop spirit in \\"I'll Stick Around\\" and \\"This Is A Call\\", both of which are some of the best songs on the album. The gentle and short melody of \\"Big Me\\" is also such a welcome surprise from such a fine drummer now turned lead singer-guitarist. <br />Other good cuts on the album include the rocking \\"Alone & Easy Target\\", the bluesy-swagger of \\"For All The Cows\\", and the raw and spirited punk-metal edge of \\"Wattershed\\". All in all, this really is an impressive debut for a band that, at that time, was just beginning to lift off.
6304383177|5.0|Though a total loss when it was released, because of Hepburn's title of box-office poison due to her long line of mediocre films, Bringing Up Baby is now considered one of the classics.  A lite and hilarious screwball comedy this film would later be the first of its kind to be on the list of American Classics.  Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant team up, along with Baby the leopard, to make an outstanding motion picture.
038533558X|5.0|Harlan Coben writes suspense stories about nice guys who are at heart, honorable romantics.  Who wouldn't love his protagonists?  Then, these characters that you've come to love  get caught up in horrible circumstances and have to solve intricate mysteries to save themselves &amp;/or the women they love.   In Gone For Good, the suspense and mystery never lets up.  Neither does the humor or romance.  Highly recommended for readers who seek a well-written, entertaining read with plenty of memorable characters.
0345442989|5.0|This book is one of my favorite Star Wars books. It's a must read for any Star Wars fan. All of the characters (favorites like Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Palpatine, Nute Gunray, Jedi Council members and many more) stayed in their character. No one did anything that would look weird. The book perfectly fits into the Star Wars world. It goes right along with everything and leads up to The Phantom Menace. The book even includes characters like Tarkin, from A New Hope. I think that everyone should read this book. It is so good!<BR>The story takes place before The Phantom Menace. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are on a mission that takes them to many interesting planets. There is lots of action, including blaster fights, lightsaber battles, and space battles. I liked how the Jedi Council sent several Jedi Masters to accompany Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to one planet. Tarkin (the soon-to-be Grand Moff) is in this book. He was, as usual, in a very high command place. It was interesting to compare him from this book to the Original Star Wars Trilogy. It's hard right now to explain the plot, but just read it. You'll like it! Also, during the story Obi-Wan was still a young Jedi Apprentice (well, duh!) but I was reminded of young Anakin Skywalker. If you have read Rogue Planet (I highly recommend it!) then you'll see what I mean. The bond between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is strong and true. James Luceno really had me turning the pages fast. This book is exciting and strong and it made me want to watch The Phantom Menace after it. Again, I highly recommend it to any Star Wars fan out there!
B000020617|5.0|...And it's not going to stop. The Foo Fighters' third album really turns out some very impressive musical strength and songwriting from Dave Grohl and company. For instance, take the first single &quot;Learn To Fly&quot;. It's a great song, and the melody and the words are catchy and so pleasant to the ear. You also can rock out your brains with &quot;Stacked Actors&quot; and the mini-explosive single &quot;Breakout&quot;, which remains in my top 10 fave Foo songs. <br />On the other side of things, there are a few surprises, and rather welcome ones at that. The lovely &quot;Aurora&quot; is gentle, melodic, and beautiful. &quot;Ain't It The Life&quot; is borderline country, and probably something you'd never hear the Foo Fighers do...but it's different. And of course, who could forget the nugget &quot;Next Year&quot;, with it's blending guitar and moving words. <br />THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE is a great album, and continues to show why the Foo Fighters remain a force to be reckoned with; ONE BY ONE would even further solidify this reputation.
0790743221|5.0|The Philadelphia Story is a wonderful romantic-comedy starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart.  This classic is about a young rich heiress who is planning her wedding.  However, when her ex-husband and two tabloid writers show up things get a little crazy.  Before the wedding the woman, Hepburn, becomes unsure of who she really wants to marry as she jumps from one love-struck man to the next.  The movie includes a wonderfully hilarious scene where Kate and Jimmy Stuart's characters are drunk.  The Philadelphia Story is one of the best romantic comedies to come out of that time.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|You either hate 'em or love 'em but there are few people that are inbetween about this fine film. Is it a classic? Yes although it's far from the most perfect Spielberg film. Clearly Spielberg has taken a page out of the Lucas playbook--when in doubt fix what really doesn't need fixing.<br />First the positives--the new opticals look terrific and the new sequences with E.T. do give him more mobility. The 20th anniversary edition includes all the new sequences. The new sequences are cute but don't really add a lot to the original film.<br />The &quot;original&quot; unretouched version of the film is included on disc two. Despite it's flaws, it's superior to the 20th anniversary re-release. Like Star Wars, what was added didn't amount to much and didn't improve the film. That's evident when you compare the two back to back.<br />The extras are nice. A look into the evolution of E.T. from conception to execution and comments from Spielberg in an introduction. Sadly, no audio commentary was done for the film. In a way that's good--most film directors explain too much and take away some of the magic.<br />The packaging is flimsy and, while well designed, E.T. should have been issued in a clamshell case. Clamshell cases tend to handle wear and tear better than cardboard packaging.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|If you want to watch a movie that has the most jaw-dropping twist since &quot;Psycho&quot;... see &quot;Memento&quot;! I hate the fact that there are 74 uses of &quot;F___&quot; in it, but every, movie has its ups &amp; downs. Guy Pearce was AMAZING, &amp; Christopher Nolan, I think, (The director) is going make it big! For those of you who can't keep up with difficult movies... forget it! This movie goes BACKWARDS! Literally. Anyway, all I have to say is... SEE THIS MOVIE!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Nearly twenty years since it was first released on the world, Steven Spielberg's 1982 sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece, \\"E.T. The Extra Terrestrial\\", remains one of the greatest movies ever made. This is one of those films that makes us feel and think at the same time.<br />This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone from anywhere. In fact, not only is it a movie, but it is a cultural phenomenon, a bigger than life event.<BR> <BR>This film is a remarkable triumph because not only is the story moving and entertaining throughout but the images crafted to move and tell the story are so artistically powerful and universally appealing. The movie is not so much a story about friendship and love between a boy and a homesick alien but a film about the boundary breaking human spirit of mankind. It's about Communication and doing what is right. The mind altering experience and life changing power of finally knowing of and interacting with life of a different kind.<BR> <BR>The movie goes WAY deeper for me as an individual. I don't feel that Spielberg should be blamed for anything. I think that any movie about a boy who develops a friendship with an alien lifeform stranded on Earth and bringing him into his home and sharing experience with that being would undoubtedly be a mega blockbuster the world around. Who wouldn't have thought that this movie would sure enough become gold.<BR> <BR>Spielberg's film, though scripted by Melissa Mathison, is almost painfully autobiographical, given what the director has said about his childhood. Like Spielberg, Thomas' character goes through life minus a father, even though his mother (Dee Wallace) does her best. He feels isolated and picked upon in school, as Spielberg frequently did. There is also plenty of religious symbolism that probably doesn't need any analyzing and was probably unintentional. In any case, looking past the fact that it won four Oscars--for sound, sound effects editing, special effects, and John Williams' legendary music score--and has grossed over $1 billion, \\"E.T.\\" is a masterpiece of the cinema, pure and simple, and it will always be that way.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Like the sumptuous DVD of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot;, Disney has produced another gloriously packaged keepsake for its Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.<br />The DVD has enough contents to keep the viewer busy for days!  There are three versions of the movie here!  The &quot;work in progress&quot; version (all line drawings, black and white, and rough) is a little hard to watch after a while, but very interesting, nonetheless.<br />The menues are adorable and Disneyesque.  I find the disks to be very easy to navigate.  Although, on disk 2 the voices tell you not to choose the &quot;rose window&quot; -- that leads to the west wing of the castle and is forbidden!!  Of course, the first thing I wanted to do was click on the rose window.  So there is a sense of fun on the disk.<br />I found the documentaries to be especially informative.  The art of animation is explained.  The use of computers is shown.  The process of developing the story is fascinating: A powdered wig fop was the original villain.  &quot;Be My Guest&quot; was sung to Belle's father, not Belle.  There are lots of these stories. There are galleries that show the film's early artwork and the &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; look that the artists were going for.  <br />The movie itself is very entertaining.  I'm a huge admirer of the opening musical number (&quot;this small provential town...&quot;) - it sets the mood and tone for the film so wonderfully.<br />&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; proved that Disney can sometimes achieve greatness with the animated film like Uncle Walt used to in the old days.  It's right up there with &quot;Lion King&quot; as one of the best films in the new Michael Eisner/Disney regime.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This movie with all of it's hype still met the unbelievable expectiations.  What a smart and action packed movie.  The movie goes into great detail about the how's and why's of spiderman without letting it slow the story down.  The action scenes were seemless between computer animation and real footage.  Add in a love story and a story about a boy just trying to fit in.  Near Perfection.  Plus with all of the bonus material available on this DVD how could one pass it up.  This movie is also suitable for most children, there are very few curse words if any and some mild violence, which could make it too rough for very you children.  This is a wonderful movie that I must recomend.
B000002GQG|3.0|This is by far the weakest of the Moodies' 1st 7 albums. &quot;Departure,&quot; &quot;Ride My See-Saw,&quot; &quot;Legend of a Mind,&quot; &quot;Voices in the Sky,&quot; &quot;The Actor&quot; &amp; &quot;The Word&quot; R all classics -- they've all got that great &quot;moody&quot; atmosphere, &amp; the vocals &amp; keyboards R gorgeous. But the rest is WILDLY uneven, &amp; &quot;Om&quot; is the stupidest thing the Moodies ever did.<BR>The rest is no bargain: &quot;Dr. Livingstone I Presume&quot; is silly; &quot;House of Four Doors&quot; is pointless &amp; endless; &quot;Best Way to Travel&quot; is a weak Mike Pinder tune; &quot;Visions of Paradise&quot; is a not-quite-good Justin Hayward number. None of these tracks will change yr life.<BR>A bonus track would've helped: On the 2-album THIS IS THE MOODY BLUES best-of you'll find &quot;Simple Game,&quot; the original B-side 2 the &quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot; single -- I think it's Mike Pinder's best song EVER (those &quot;doo-doo-doo&quot; choruses'll get U every time!), &amp; they shoulda included it here. Woulda raised my rating 2 3-1/2 stars at least!<BR>Overall: This is the most dated &amp; uneven Moodies LP. I'd save buying it til U have the rest of the 1st 7, LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, Hayward &amp; Lodge's BLUE JAYS, &amp; THE PRESENT. This sure ain't no 4got10 classic.

B00005ATQE|5.0|This movie about Marine Basic Training and The U.S. Marines in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive is very educational and entertaining. First, Gunnery Sargent Hartman is the most loved and hated man among the recruits. Second, it shows how people in the rear areas lived. Third, it shows how life was during the 1968 Tet offensive. Matthew Modine as private joker is the man who stole the show.
B0000640VO|5.0|If you take life too seriously, then this film is probably not for you. It's fun, interesting, and thought provoking but also a little silly and perhaps strange. Amelie encounters many questions in her pursuit of happiness and fulfillment. At what point do we stop helping others and begin to help ourselves? Is it alright to interfere in others' lives? And when is it ok to take a risk? For me, the movie wasn't about the destination, but the journey itself. Enjoy!
0440237688|4.0|I agree with this review because Dev Patel (the reviewer) says The Giver is a good book to read for adults and young adults.  She says the book makes you think and it points out the problems in a utopian society.  The government is always watching and the people are at one constant emotional level.  The book helps people understand what is to live in a perfect society, and why we dont.  In the community the people feel no pain or emotion, and when they do they have to take pills to stop them.  The Giver is a book for people who enjoy reading books that give you a new perspective.  I give the book a <BR>four out of five.
B00006IUL7|4.0|That was the advice received by Dormer after being unable to sleep for almost a week.  The real reason to his insomnia is a combination of guilt from an 'accident/crime' he committed &amp; his inability to adjust to Nightmute where the sun always shines.  How he handles his personal problems at the same time solve a mystery is worth the wait &amp; watch. <br />Here is another film directed by Christopher Nolan.  A very straightforward film without the twists or the unchronological sequence of Memento where he was recognized -- but nonetheless as intese.  A power cast led by Pacino, Williams &amp; Swank directed by Nolan...How can it ever go wrong?
B000001FXX|5.0|As one who listened to my mother's Bob Marley records in my childhood (she's from Jamaica), this the one I like the most. The songs on here such as No Woman, No Cry, Natty Dread, Lively Up yourself,  and Talkin' Blues are the songs that helped Bob Marley reach a worldwide audience.
0345339711|4.0|Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkein is one of the best books I have ever read.  Two Towers is the second book of the Lord of the Ring series.  The plot of the novel revolves around destroying the ring of evil power.<BR> <BR> The novel beginning with an interesting \\"cat and mouse\\" game. The characters are from all over middle earth.  Some of the characters are Froto, Gimly, Arawhen, elf and dwarf. The character are trying to destroy the ring. They had to destroy the so the evil would not come back.<br /> In the book Gimmle comes later. Gimmle helps them get to somewhere they need to go. He is helping them because he was tortured because he had the for along time. When they found out he had it they found him and tortured him. On the way back they blindfolded him so he would not know the way back.  <br /> In the book they had a lot of imagery. When I read some parts of the book it felt like I was in the book. He used a lot of description. The symbol of the book was the ring itself. The ring symbols the book because the book is based on destroying the ring. The theme of the book is about the Hobbits. Hobbits even though small have as much to offer as humans, elfs and dwarfs.<br /> I would recommend Two Towers  to anyone who likes to read to fantasy and adventure books. Tolkein used many details to describe the characters and settings with in the novel. The sere Lord of the Ring  is an exciting, suspenseful and action packed book. I cant wait to read the next book in the series.

031286504X|5.0|this book is the best book i have ever read and i think that everyone should read this book and i bet all of you that you will love it forever once you have read the first chapter i give this book 5 stars because thats how much i love it i have never read a book that was better then this book one reason that i love this book is because he shoots the vampires in the face with the pistols and when he runs out of ammo he gives them blows to the heads with the handles of the pistols when i saw this book i knew it was the book for me i saw the cover it had alot of vampires so i thought this book would be about vampires and it was.So if you see this book at the librey rent it you wont regret it i promise.

B00005JKED|3.0|There is everything a typical Hollywood movie has in this movie: violence, sex and an not-so-logical story. You are entertained with the cool acting by denzel washington, but as the story gets non-sense, especially in the ending, your expectation will be betrayed.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus is a talented band.  This cd is a display of their musically versatility.  It's definitely worth a listen.
B00006F2TV|3.0|I watched this movie in a airplane, on a small LCD monitor, and I think that is enough for it. I don't understand why this movie can cause such an hype at all. The graphics is not that great compared with movies like Starwars, and the story is very shalow, nothing more than a comic strip like the batman. I think this movie did not live up to its hype.

B000068OCS|5.0|This DVD brings out only one word for me - masterpiece. Before I saw it, I would never have believed any movie could evoke a clearer picture of our troubled existence - and this does it without a spoken word. The music is unbelieveable - Philip Glass did a tremendous job and the director made a wise decision actually cutting some scenes to fit the music; something I cannot imagine most of todays ego driven directors would even consider, let alone condone.<br />This piece should be mandatory viewing.
0684800713|5.0|LOOK: 1) \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" does NOT liken Brett to Circe. Rather, one of its characters, its least attractive character, in fact, likens her to Circe, and Brett and Jake, its heroine and hero, find this likening a great joke. <br />2) Jake is NOT impotent in the sense this term is usually intended; he CAN be sexually aroused; it's just that a war injury (the lost generation, remember?) has rendered him physiologically (NOT psychologically) incapable of consummating his love for Brett. This is a very different thing. <br />3) \\"The Sun Also Rises\\"'s \\"slang\\" has not aged at all. <br />4) \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is NOT about \\"love and money\\"; it TELLS you right off, with its quoting of Getrude Stein and the Bible, precisely what it IS about. You don't have to go digging for deep hidden meanings; you only have to sit back and enjoy it. But if you don't find its initial description of Robert Cohn and the bit with the Parisian prostitute (which set the tone for the entire book) funny, you aren't likely to. You may SAY you enjoyed it, having heard that the book is considered classic, and assuming others will take you for an erudite, culturally sophisticated person if you do, but that's different from REALLY enjoying it.

B000003S0I|4.0|I've got this on vinyl, and I only ever play side one (title song part one, &quot;Book of Saturday&quot;, and &quot;Exiles&quot;). I particularly like in title song part one the startling contrasts in dynamics, the references to Balinese harmonic (scalar) material, the 10/8 section -- 1 2 3, 1 2 3, 1 2, 1 2 --, and, as someone else has pointed the out, the bits that remind one of Vaughn Williams's &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;. &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot;'s lyric is sophisticated, witty, and imaginative -- one of the best rock lyrics ever. The instrumental sections in &quot;Exile&quot; show the band at its finest.<br />Saw this group in concert spring 1973 in Saint Louis. GREAT concert. Spooky Tooth (remember them?) opened. Robert Frip sat. The band played at a comfortable volume (and especial relief for me -- I'd been to a Led Zeppelen [sp?] concert the night before.<br />So, yeah, buy this, and while you're at it, also buy &quot;Red&quot; and a recording of Ralph Vaughn Williams's 5th symphony (those conducted by Adrian Boult and Andre Previn are among the best).
B000002C2E|1.0|I've gone back and forth several times, re-reading the glowing reviews here and re-listening to this CD, and I'm almost convinced that there must be *two* Time Out of Mind's, because the one I'm hearing doesn't match any comments here. I don't hear anything landmark. I don't hear anything transcendent. I don't even hear anything that I can take seriously enough to be convinced that it's really dark. I hear trite, forced, bubbling-up expulsions that shouldn't be allowed to tarnish your music collection.<br />The genre is clearly blues, though really bad blues, IMO. The production is overdone (*very* late 80s); otherwise, some of the tinkering of sounds could have been interesting. The lyrics are an incredibly powerful yawn, with the cleanest ones lifted from elsewhere. (&quot;going down the road feeling bad&quot;? &quot;baby turn the lamp down low&quot;?). To describe its weaknesses could take eight or nine lengthy paragraphs, but its *so* weak that it isn't worth anyone's time to write them. ... So I'll stop.<br />You should too, before ordering this. Pick something else. Anything else.<br />Unless you're buying a gift, for someone you don't like. Really don't like.
068484267X|5.0|So many people wrote already about this book! But, for me, a Brazilian working with children in a very similar family environment, it meant more than just of one of the best books that I have ever read. <BR>Ireland was once a very poor country, with little boys and girls struggling to succeed in a violent and difficult world. I wonder how many have succeeded indeed. <BR>Also I wonder how many Franks are out there, today, turning the pages of their every day lives without knowing what the end will be.
B000002U82|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. This is easily one of the top desert island discs of all time. I personally don't like 'Money' (it doesn't really go with the smoothness of the rest of the album, but always a good time to grab some food or a bathroom break during live performances) From heartbeat to heartbeat, this album engulfs you and carries you to new heights of musical ecstasy. No album has ever been on the bilboard to 200 for as long as this one (13 yrs+ I think). All in all, if you aren't familiar with the Floyd, this is a good place to start.
0140185232|5.0|I enjoyed this book from top to bottom.  I am not a big reader although when I find one that I can really sink my teeth into, I absorb every literary line.  This book to me is what art should always aspire to be- inspiring notes on the passage of life but to a melody completely it's own- i.e. this book does everything Hegal believed art should be.<br />  It took me quite a few years after seeing the movie of the same name written and played by Bill Murray, to decide that I should investigate the book.  I was very pleased for the extra depth of character and idea the book displayed.<br />  W. Somerset Maugham displays such a nack for dialog, you get such a sense of timelessness of the different characters struggles.  For instance one thing that Maugham made clear is that no character was greater than the other (perhaps a flaw of a writer's love of his characters) though some lives certainly could seem more noble than others depending on from where one stands.<br />Overall the book is a good read without a speck of pretention- which is what so often turns me off from some of great writers.  It inspires inner search and observation, and simpathy for others who seem to lack good character-
B00005YUNY|5.0|Yes with an Orchestra?? Of course.... If you are a Yes fan, this has been a long time coming. The mix (I prefer the DTS, has the best bass range) is wonderful and the animation is a nice addition with the ability to turn it off if you like. The playing is superb (yes, I know its not Bruford, but let's face it , he was only there for a few albums compared to White who went through a lot more with the band) and the absence of Wakeman is noticeable, but the keyboard player plus the orchestra really makes up for this. For the purist this may not do, but for a real prog/Yes fan, it sounds wonderful. Anderson and Howe are totally up to the task (Jon sounds incredible although he is a little flaky on the song intros)The funniest thing is Squires Spandex pants (he still thinks he's 18.)<br />Track selection is marvelous (Even a 'Ritual' performance Mmmmm.)New and old combine nicely here and we get the classics (as always) including 'Long Distance Runaround' and 'And You and I'
B0000024W3|5.0|i wrote a review of this, very colorful. you did not choose to include it! it was two weeks ago! i said a lot of things about what was going on at the time Bob recorded this masterpiece, which was way ahead of its time. those that don't &quot;get it&quot; never will, those that do (those not limited by time &amp; space) will always love this record!
0345409671|1.0|I hated this book.  I had read and loved all the other books in the series, but this one just (wasnt very good).  You simply don't mix religion and fantasy.  It takes the wonderful setting from the previous books, and turns it upside down.  DON'T read this book.  It is stupid and disgusting.  If you are reading the vampire cronicles, just skip over it.  Its not worth the time.
B00006HBUA|1.0|The only good part of the movie was the animation for Scooby. Other wise they took moderate actors and made them very bad actors. Maybe that means they are good actors by being sooooo bad.<br />Don't buy this movie for yourself. Buy it for the White Elephant gift exchange at your next Christmas party.
0061053147|4.0|This is a fantastic book and reference tool, and a must-have for any hard-core [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner]] (BR) fanatic.  It's packed with names, places, dates, fascinating factoids throughout, a trivia cornucopia.  But, you've gotta be a serious BR fan to stick with author Paul Sammon all the way through this densely detailed, thorough, and clearly personally meaningful work.  The book does have one major flaw:  Sammon's failure to prove his subtitle promise that Blade Runner is the most influential sci-fi film of all time.<br /><br />The book reads easily and well, Sammon's style informal.  He writes as one BR fan to another, a great approach.  The production details are thorough, insightful, and wonderful to read, 441 pages in 18 chapters, with nine appendices containing interviews, production details, the cast list, etc.  Sammon is a total BR devotee, I compliment and commend him on his achievement and the recognition of those who worked so hard to make BR.<br /><br />There is vast information throughout from all members of the cast and crew, all of them supportive of Sammon's effort to tell their story.  There is surprisingly liberal information from the movie's principals, Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Michael Deeley, Syd Mead, Hampton Fancher and David Peoples.  One disappointment is the absence of direct input and comment from the soundtrack maestro, [[ASIN:B000Z0OX9O Vangelis]].  Sammon nevertheless gives him thorough justice.<br /><br />Wonderful esoteric tidbits abound through the book, such as the revelation that the original lead was not Harrison Ford, but Dustin Hoffman.  Edward James Olmos provides great background on his preparation for his role as Gaff and his detailed construction of his Cityspeak dialog (most of it sadly unused).  We learn of fantastic special effects scenes never realized, and that in the background in one of the aerial city shots is a painted Millennium Falcon model.  We learn that the process of creating this movie was a years-long, highly personal effort, first by Hampton Fancher to secure rights and create a screenplay, then later by Ridley Scott and other members of the team who continued to craft the film even after they were fired by the production company.  It is a story of dedication to craft and art from a group of artists looking to raise diverse artistic, social, moral, and ethical issues with this genre-transcending film.  I often was reminded of [[ASIN:B000XECFXS Hearts of Darkness]], the story of Francis Ford Coppola's unending dedication to and struggles making [[ASIN:B000FSME1A Apocalypse Now]].<br /><br />Highlighted superbly in the book is the true key to BR's success, Ridley Scott's intense attention to detail, his relentless questioning of the larger context and physical placement of the story.  For example, Scott insisted on instructions painted on the futuristic parking meters in the street scenes.  Absolutely illegible in the finished film, this sort of detail nonetheless set a compelling, even subconscious tone for the set and those who worked within it.<br /><br />Particularly entertaining is Chapter 8, the scene by scene account of the shoot, with comment from the actors, producers, specialists, crew, and Scott.  Also very useful for the true BR fanatic are the appendices listing all of the various BR versions, their formats, availability, and catalog information.  Sammon does the same for the various soundtracks and musical compositions heard throughout the film, even the music and lyrics from the advertisements sported on the ad-blimps.  Especially enjoyable is Appendix C's detailed list of \\"blunders,\\" a compendium of the film's both obvious and subtle continuity errors, dubbing flaws, and inserted footage.<br /><br />There are dozens of illustrations throughout the book, and Sammon gives due credit to BR's still photographer for the hundreds of stills that BR fans know and collect.  The main problem is that the ONLY color photos in the entire book are on the front and back covers.  The B/W photos in the book are small, grainy, poorly reproduced, and do not reflect Sammon's praise.  These sorry photos do not allow the reader, who hasn't seen many of these never-before-published stills and production drawings, to revel in the details.<br /><br />Sammon is overly obsessed with cataloging ALL of the different versions of the film, and detailing the most minute differences.  We have chapter after repetitive chapter discussing the differences between the Workprint, the pre-release revisions, the theatrical release, the various video, broadcast, and satellite releases, as well as the competing director's cuts.  The fascinating core tale of the political, economic, and artistic fights over all of these versions of the film is lost as Sammon loses track and focuses too closely on the details of the different versions, obsessing to the point of irrelevance on miniscule details.  For the BR fanatic this is invaluable, but for most readers this makes the narrative tedious and repetitive, given this technical information is available in Appendix B.<br /><br />Sammon's promised discussion of BR's influence on sci-fi film is absent.  His subtitle, \\"The Fascinating Story Behind the...Most Influential SF Film Ever Made\\" promises a discussion of BR's influence on filmdom.  His discussion is poorly introduced, disorganized, and sorrowfully weak on supporting facts and testimonials, leading ultimately to the conclusion that BR simply is NOT the most influential sci-fi film of all time.  In fact, the paltry six-page discussion of BR's influence is one of the most shallow, most poorly researched and organized parts of the entire book.  Nowhere in the book does he cite any filmmaker, actor, editor, producer, or special effects artist describing BR as an influence. Sammon's strength and enthusiasm clearly lie in the film's production details.<br /><br />This book is an invaluable acquisition for any die-hard BR fan, and a great memoir for any student of filmmaking.  It's not for the casual BR or film fan; it's a cult book, just as Blade Runner is a cult film.  Disappointingly, Sammon fails to deliver a crucial element of his work, a thorough and convincing discussion of BR's influence on cinema and its place in greater filmdom.otos in the book are small, grainy, poorly reproduced, and do not reflect Sammon's praise.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Where has Norah Jones been?  I mean, in the midst of nasal pop (Britney) and chicks with diva talent that cannot be realized (Christina), the music scene has been aching for a Norah Jones.  Whew!  She's arrived!  This CD is purely beautiful.  It's so versatile and there's no getting enough of it.  Relax, study, have an intimate night with your partner...Norah fits any category that you want her to fit in.  Her voice is beautiful, somewhere between a yawn and an utterance, her style is classic and her lyrics are fresh.  This is easily one of the best albums I've ever purchased.  Thank you, Norah, for revamping the young musician scene.  Quality music is alive and well, not to fear!

0316666343|2.0|Sometimes the public is swept up in the hype of a product that delivers less than it claims to offer.  The Lovely Bones is no exception.  This novel is purported to be an insightful view of death, what tragedy means for survivors, and how those survivors navigate lives without someone they love; instead, it reads like a fictionalized account of a \\"Touched by an Angel\\" episode. The only force propelling this narrative forward was my dim curiosity about what would happen to Susie's killer - hardly the emphasis the author intended, I suspect.  Additionally, Susie's experiences in heaven sound not unlike how purgatory is often described. An overly simplistic novel whose runaway success is most likely motivated by its I-Can-Read language and its appeal to sensitive types who watch PAX.
B00005JK8K|3.0|... instead of giving another synposis of the film, I'm going to give you my first gut instinct about what I thought the movie was like to the senses.<br />OK, I, probably like many, missed the film in the theaters, and so when I found out that it was coming out on DVD so soon, I was both shocked and excited.  Shocked that it was coming out so soon, excited because I missed it in the theaters.  So gladfully I pre-ordered the DVD early on.  I rccently received it and I gave it a spin.  I do have a surround sound system, but it's out of commission getting my sub-woofers replaced, so therefore I was left watching it without full sound effects.  But nevertheless, after several of the battle scenes, (and there were many), I felt like I was watching a conglomeration of about every Pacific Theater John Wayne movie ever made with today's production values and special effects of course.<br />Now then, I asked myself, is that bad? or is it good for a change?  Especially coming off of films like SPR, Thin Red Line, and Band of Brothers, I feel a change would be welcome.  The film is refreshing in one way, while extremely hoaky in another.  It was refreshing in that for once our senses were treated to a more light-hearted war movie that didn't have all the emotional baggage with it like Thin Red Line did.  On the otherhand, it was hoaky because the battle scenes just seemed so surreal due to that it appeared that no one bullet was fired that MISSED its target.  I mean, when our heroes had run out of rifle or SMG ammo, they resorted to pistols.  In on scene near the end, Cage pops off several rounds of his pistol and every bullet hits and kills a Japanese soldier at probably maximum range of the pistol.  And if that was unbelievable, every round from a rifle or SMG seemd to hit their mark.  I mean when you turn around and spray a hill with Thompson SMG fire and you kill the half dozen soldeirs running down that hill, something tells me that really couldn't happen that way.<br />But with that bit of hoakiness set aside, the battle scenes, of which there were many, were quite entertaining to watch and I assume to listen to as well.  Lots of explosions from Japanese artillery and Hellcats dropping bombs.  I noticed some of the sets used looked very similar to sets used in older Pacific Theater movies, which gave me the idea of the John Wayne connection.<br />But anyway, I give the film 3-stars.  An average rating.  Not the best, but surely not the worst either.  It's fun to watch, you just gotta put aside any WWII knowledge you might have and enjoy yourself.  Oh yeah, better pop some popcorn too.But with that bit of hoakiness set aside, the battle scenes, of which there were many, were quite entertaining to watch and I assume to listen to as well.

1400031346|4.0|Precious Mamotswe is a very likeable detective, and this first book is an engaging pleasure, particularly as a light interlude to heavier tombs on the bedstand.  The characters are refreshingly original, and I enjoy the armchair trip to Africa. I was somewhat disappointed that the cases tend to appear as a too-short series of vignettes, not enough tangles of threads for my tastes in this genre.  Still, I'll likely pick up another in this series when I have an appetite for a light and warm hearted diversion.
B000002WYT|2.0|I'm not a DMB fan and I'm writing this review as someone who has purchased Crash following a recommendation by a friend. This review is my impression of this album (I've never heard any other DMB album before).<BR>Reading the reviews on this site makes clear one thing - the members of the DMB know how to play their instruments. But listening to the CD reveals what all the reviewers forget to mention: they can't for the life of them write good songs. <BR>The most alarming part is the infantile lyrics which make even the somewhat catchy songs a gruesome listening experience. For instance, in So Much to Say, Dave sings, &quot;my heaven is a nice house in the sky, got central heating and I'm alright&quot; - if that doesn't sound stupid then what does? His lyrics for the others songs, of course: &quot;I have no lid upon my head ... but if I did, you could look inside and see what's on my mind&quot; he sings in Let You Down. Whatever serious intentions he had when writing this, I can only burst in a fit of laughter upon hearing it. I suppose Dave meant these lyrics to be charming, but he's off the mark.<BR>Add to this the album's own silent disease - the lack of melody. After listening to this CD for 3 times in a row I still can barely remember any particular part of it. Contrast this with any classic album - say, any Beatles good album - in which at least several songs immediately become imprinted on your mind after only listening to them once.<BR>Why on earth anyone would be happy with this music I do not know, but do yourselves a favor and don't forget to listen before you buy!
B000021XS0|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I don't know everything there is to know about prog rock/metal, but I know for a fact these guys are the best at what they do. Some [people say] this album has no feeling, and it's \\"mechanical\\" or [something like that], hahahahaha. That's not true at all. It's not mechanical, it's precise. And it's played with a lot of feeling.<br />That said, as you probably already know, DT is probably the most talented group of musicians in the world...no joke. Do you have any idea how hard this would be for a normal band to pull off? Impossible, I'd say. Not to mention the hooks, groove, and cool riffs they always manage to throw in. This is probably my favorite DT album yet, and if you have half a brain, you'll like this stuff too.<br />Listen to the other guys that gave this album a good review...they probably know more about it that I do. I'm just here to confirm that this is infact a masterpiece.
B000002UJQ|5.0|As long as I can remember, this album has been 5 stars. I believe people who listen to Puddle of Mud and Linkin Park somehow hear about what an album this is and gives it a try. Let me tell you something. If you can enjoy those types of bands and then review any Radiohead album for that matter, don't waste your time.YOU HAVE NO DEPTH. YOU HAVE NO CREATIVITY. YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR INTELLIGENCE. I'm not saying you have a bad taste in music. All I am saying is that if you appreciate music with nursery rhyme lyrics that I could write on accident, then you probably are just not understanding the complexity of Radioheads music. I use to be able to name a band on the radio the first time I heard their song. I can't name any on the radio no matter how many times I hear it because everything sounds the damn same, even their damn voices. So on another note I am tired of new bands like Coldplay, Starsailor, The Doves, Travis, etc... being compare to Radiohead. I like all of these bands, but come on, Radiohead doesn't sound like Radiohead on even their own albums. They are unique, and experimental. No one sounds like them, period. As far as the cd goes, it is brilliant and beautiful. No song lacks anything as far as I can see. Keep voting. Let's get this back to 5 stars.
B0000009RX|4.0|For people not familiar with Frank's work and wanting a place to start, here it is! The album is a sharp-witted & funny take on The Sgt.

B0000636UN|4.0|After a four-year break from recording, Sheryl Crow re-emerges with her best album yet. \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" is filled with the music that Crow has made famous, incorporating new sounds with those of classic rock.    There are many guest vocalists on this album, but they don't distract from Sheryl's distinct lead. Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, and others are great additions to an already beautiful sound.    There are so many wonderful tracks, it's difficult to pinpoint the highlights. 'Soak Up The Sun' is the epitome of summer music, with its laid-back lyrics and fun-loving feel. 'It's Only Love' is the distinct opposite of a typical love song. While it showcases regret for time lost, it remains optimistic for new love to come along. 'Diamond Road', my personal favorite, is a musical masterpiece and perhaps the most beautifully crafted song I've heard her sing. Filled with touching lyrics, it acutely portrays the struggle to overcome difficulties - something Crow is no stranger to. With a catchy refrain and hopeful message, it is destined to become a classic.    Crow's great instrumental ability shines through on this work. The guitars are there, but she takes advantage of violins, organs, and several other unused instruments to bring a unique flavor to this record.     Sheryl Crow has outdone herself on this, her latest album. With raw, emotional lyrics, she once again bares her soul to the musical world. It is passionate, touching, and amazingly brilliant.
B000068TSI|5.0|We Were Soldiers is an easy five stars because, like Saving Private Ryan, it is powerful, moving, realistic, and yes....very, VERY violent! The bloody violence & carnage in this masterpiece is even more excessive & graphic than Saving Private Ryan. Mel Gibson does a spendid job as the main character who leads a group of American soldiers into hellacious battle. This movie isn't for the squimiesh, but it is definetly a true epic. Watch it and enjoy it if you're able to stomach it. It will open your eyes to the disturbing realization of what war is really like. If you loved Saving Private Ryan, Windtalkers, Full Metal Jacket, and Pearl Harbor, then you will surely enjoy this amazing motion picture.
B000002UWW|5.0|Before I bought the \\"What hits!?\\" complication, I never really knew the meaning of funky (in that context). But then I stumbled upon this gem, which screams funkadelic at the top of it's  lungs. Normally I set a track-by-track review, but it has 18 tracks (of gold). so instead I will just mention the Highlights. Ratings are not nessicary since there is no filler.<BR>  <BR>  1) Higer ground: A flawless version of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground.<br />   2) Fight like a brave:  Track 1 on \\"The uplift mofo party plan\\", it is a  funky type of song, that sort of sounds like it was made by RUN D-M-C, or that Beastie boys song, only it has one person singing it.<br />   3) Under the bridge: There first major ballad! It doesn't sound like the other songs, but is still very good.<br />   4) Jungle man: Kind of hard to discribe. I would say it's funky, but not in a rap way.<br />   5) Jhony kick a hole in the sky: One of those tracks with the woman singing in the backround for part of it.<br />  Before I go, I would like to tell you, if you are a new fan, then you can buy this cd beacause with an open mind this cd is good for anyone who is intrested in this group, exept for the die hard fans who have all of there old albums. Just remember that the Anthony Kedis in this album, and the Anthony Kedis in \\"Californication\\", or in their latest, sound nothing like each other,exept for in \\"Under the bridge\\". That doesn't mean the old stuff is bad (notice how I gave it five stars), it is just different, and takes almost no adjusting to.<br />  For now I think that you are about to throw out your back and since I reside in your spine, I must go.
0156012197|4.0|This book is good for people of all ages.  When read as a childrens story, it can be a fun and interesting story about a prince who goes and visits other planets.  However, when you read it and recognize the books allegorical qualities it becomes a much deeper read...<br />The author tries to show us that you should try to be happy when going through life.  It doesn't matter what we do with our lives, its how we've lived.  It also doesn't hurt to try  recapturing your lost childhood innocence once in a while. And finally, that the world would be a much better place if grownups would just have more imagination, and be less serious.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. There's, um, shrimp kebabs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich... That's, that's about it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a fantastic CD!  The music is simple, and Nora's voice is beautiful.  It is thoughtful, romantic and sexy.  Unlike many CD's that have only one or two cuts worth listening to, every song on this CD is enjoyable.  Definitely worth the investment!
B00005U2JL|5.0|Although amazon STILL lists this dvd as without a release date, it is stated on Manson's official site that it is to be released on Oct. 29....... In time for Halloween!!! Also there is a 30 min movie directed by Manson included on the DVD, a lot of interesting footage to be on this one!! Manson peiced this dvd together himself....Can't wait!!
B000002G7E|5.0|If you look up avant-garde in the dictionary you will see White Light/ White Heat as the definition. This is a great album from the Velvets Before I bought it i wondered why there were only six songs but Sister Ray is so great it wouldn't matter if it's the only song on there. This album is pure NOISE. If you have never heard the Velvet Underground before you may want to start out with their debut banana album Peel Slowly and See.
0393307050|5.0|A few years ago, after the New York Times Book Review article on Patrick O'Brian and his Aubrey/Maturin series, I picked up Master and Commander and decided to give it a try.  I found it difficult but fascinating.  Unfortunately, the difficult part was greater than the fascinating part.  I was constantly trying to figure out what sail he was talking about and wishing I understood nautical terms better.  I made it through the book, felt it was worth the effort, but lacked the will to move on.  A couple of years later, I read HMS Surprise and found it a bit easier and increasingly fulfilling.  Over the next couple of years, I read a few more.<br />Early this year, I decided to start over again and read Master and Commander in conjunction with listening to it in the Patrick Tull audio version.  I read more than listened, but found the combination to be compelling.  I've sat in my garage many times after coming home and listened till the end of a chapter.<br />Today, I'm in the midst of no. 19 in the series, with only Blue at the Mizzen waiting.  <br />It has been one of the most rewarding literary exercises of my life.  While the battle scenes are brilliant, they're really the backdrop for a much greater story.  The real story of this series is the friendship between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin.  And in reality, O'Brian didn't write twenty novels, he wrote one long one--he merely broke them up so that mere mortals would be willing to read them.  <br />The plots are often ingenious, but the Aubrey/Maturin series is far more focused on the characters, beginning of course with Aubrey and Maturin.  But each other character is sui generis--absolutely unique, as real humans are.  There's not a stick figure in the bunch.  Some of my favorites:  Preserved Killick (the only manservants with greater claims to fame may be Jeeves and Sam Weller), Barrett Bonden, Diana Villiers, Sophie, Mrs. Williams, etc. etc.<br />But in the end, the story comes down to the love of two good friends for each other.<br />Read the whole series in order and you'll be greatly rewarded.
B00006F7S4|2.0|I'd rather be listening to Mutations...still in all, I'm looking forward to seeing Beck live with The Flaming Lips. I found this album, to be blunt, boring. If it's low-key music and strange lyrics you're looking for, you'll certainly get your fix with the last Sparklehorse album or something.<BR> I only got this CD because it was Beck, and though I think musicians doing something different is great, I expected something...more...of Beck.<BR> That's just my opinion. <BR> I didn't like 'Kid A' or 'Hot Shots II' either. <BR>Maybe I'm just bummed...maybe I should just listen again.
B00005J9M3|5.0|The pet shop boys achieve perfection on their 4th studio effort &quot;behaviour.&quot; While many fans hold &quot;Very&quot; to be the boys best album, it is &quot;behaviour&quot; that pulls together every aspect of the duo's irony, wit, and sophistication. The overall mood of the album is somber but in classic PSB fashion the backdrop is still clubland. On the opening (and finest) track &quot;being boring&quot; Neil Tennant sings a semi-autobiographical tale about coming of age, the dreams of youth, and how things turn out- all set to a 4/4 disco beat. Other stand-out tracks include the strings &amp; shuffle-beat heavy &quot;my October Symphony&quot;-a personal favourite of Guns'n'Roses frontman Axel Rose and the inspiration behind their hit &quot;November Rain&quot;, the dance/pop &quot;the end of the world&quot; and the hauntingly quiet &quot;in the wind.&quot; Behaviour is an ESSENTIAL album to any collection and one which showcases both brilliant songwriting and pop sensabilities. You'll regret passing it up!
0792151712|5.0|The story seems fictitious with Jack and Rose;it is all romance of their part. But if you look at the event when the Titanic sinks, it will touch your heart and make you cry. <BR>So far it has made me. <BR>I loved when the Irish aboard had their party.<BR>So I recommend this item and also the Cds of the movie.The music is pretty and still could make you cry.<BR>I know it so far has made me.
6305252521|2.0|Jim Carrey is surely proves he is a great actor - but this movie is stepping on slippery philosophical grounds.  Underlying the interesting concept of unknowingly spending your entire life on television, The Truman Show teaches us that human beings are not capable of understanding and perceiving &quot;true reality.&quot; Just as in Plato's Republic, in the example of the cave shadows that are mistaken for reality, Jim Carrey is only allowed to understand Truth once he breaks beyond the bounds of our Earthly constraints.  The movie asks, how can we know anything at all for sure?<br />Hanging on to such metaphysical assumptions is very dangerous.  Existence requires no explanation for why it is exists, because it exists before and independant of any human perception. Existence exists - it is a foundation, an axiom, and hated by professors of philsophy the world round.<br />The danger of The Truman Show's &quot;primacy of conciousness&quot; nod is understood when we are told that &quot;philosopher kings,&quot; the select few who hold the genius and ability to understand &quot;true reality&quot; must reign over the rest of us - you begin to lay the philosophical foundation for dictatorship.
B000000Y87|5.0|I had the pleasure of meeting Bill Evans and was struck, even on a first impression, that he was a man who had experienced tragedy and depression throughout his life.  His music reflects this tragic quality.  Even before the death of Scotty LaFaro he conveyed a musical feeling that was oh so thoughtful and introspective.  There is nothing happy or fun about the jazz that Bill Evans plays.  It is intellectual, inward-looking, and very musical.  <br />There is no reason I can think of to pass up this recording.  It shows a great genius in a great trio at a pivotal time in jazz.  Just half a decade after the death of Charlie Parker, Bill Evans was transforming jazz into a highly refined form of twentieth century chamber music.  His influence in this regard is almost immeasurable--Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, etc.  And now there is a whole generation of new young players who are neo-Evansite players; the tradition is alive and it is beautiful.<br />By the way, an earlier reviewer complains about Verve's sequencing of the recordings.  This, however, is not a Verve recording; it's on Original Jazz Classics, and is released under the Fantasy/Milestone group's label.  I should also point out that in those days multiple takes of a song were done in a row (even on live dates); so in fact the alternates may represent a true sequencing of the recordings (the way the audience heard them!).  On Eric Dolphy's live in Europe recordings he plays several takes of \\"Don't Blame Me\\" consecutively.  This is a recording from the same era as this Evans recording.
B000001Y5D|4.0|First of all, the 4 Non Blondes are no more, which is difficult to understand, given the success this album enjoyed.  The San Francisco based quartet signed with Interscope Records in the early `90s, and their debut effort in 1992, \\"Bigger, Better, Faster, More!\\" was their first and last recording together, but it produced one mega-hit, \\"What's Up,\\" which sold more singles than any song in warner history.  Still, they were destined to join the roster of the music scene's One-hit Wonders; but anyone who listens to this album isn't going to forget it any time soon.<br />The band produced an alternative rock/coffee house blues sound with a penetrating presentation that would give your coffee the jitters, and it's that sound that is captured on this CD.  From the opening bars of \\"Train,\\" to the final refrain of \\"No Place Like Home,\\" the Non Blondes come at you with a vengeance, and they give no quarter.  This is raw, edgy stuff that will get your attention with the first cut, and by the time you reach the end of the album the first time through, you're hooked.  They get you and they get you good.<br />To give credit where it's due, the 4 Non Blondes are:  Christa Hillhouse, base; Roger Rocha, guitar; Dawn Richardson, drums; and last but not least, singer/songwriter (and consummate artist) Linda Perry on vocals.  And referencing Perry as such is not to be taken as a mere platitude; because talented as Hillhouse, Rocha and Richardson are, it is Perry who is the real story here.<br />Without question, Linda Perry is the driving force behind the band.  She has a strong, distinctive voice and she knows how to use it.  And the term \\"subtle\\" is not in her vocabulary.  She gives you everything she's got on every song, and she has quite a bit to give.  Think Taylor Dane meets Tina Turner and you'll have an idea.  Perry is definitely not a gentle breeze blowing across the landscape; she's a gale force wind reducing everything in her path to rubble.  And she does it SO well.<br />Perry is something of an enigma, as well.  Her sound is hard and fast, but her lyrics tend to be introspective, even wistful, and range from the musings of a dreamer to a `60s kind of social consciousness, all delivered with a spine-shattering effectiveness more evocative of an Ani DeFranco or Michelle Shocked than a Joni Mitchell or Jewel.  Consider the soul searching words with which she begins \\"What's Up\\":  \\"25 years of my life and still/ I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope/ for a destination--\\"  It's a rocker's contemplation of life, which she seems to answer with the acquiescent \\"Morphine &amp; Chocolate,\\" in which she strives to \\"Substitute my enemies with real good friends/ Morphine &amp; Chocolate are my/ Substitute, substitutes--\\"<br />Then on to the words of the daydreamer, \\"So I'll reach up to the sky/ And pretend that I'm a Spaceman/ in another place and time,\\" in \\"Spaceman,\\" which then continues on with the thought that \\"I guess I'm lookin' for a brand new place/ I remember living in a different life--\\"  And \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" a commentary on society and the state of the world in which we're living:  \\"It's such a wonderful country/ but the man is burning it down--\\"<br />Like Jim Morrison and Springsteen before her, Perry is a hard blues/rocker with a poet's soul.  But more than that she's got \\"attitude\\"-- the right kind and plenty of it.  And she knows how to deliver the goods, which she so aptly demonstrates on \\"Bigger, Better, Faster, More!\\" with a little help from her friends.  In the final analysis, however, 4 Non Blondes is a band destined to be a footnote in music history.  Linda Perry, on the other hand, is going to be remembered, and she is happening now.  Linda Perry is forever.  And so is her music.
0316666343|4.0|This book intrigued me from the very beginning.  I tend to enjoy novels dealing with the relationship between the living and the dead and this was a remarkable example of just that.  Ms. Sebold portrays the afterlife as a very personal experience - to each his/her own heaven ... or hell, for that matter.  Susie, who was murdered at 14 years old, chooses to observe her family for many years, witnessing the effect that her death had on the lives of those she left behind. <br />There were times when the book was a bit creepy, making me think that some dead person was watching my every move in a voyeuristic sort of way. And reading about the actions of a serial killer made me worry about my own children ...But it dealt so wonderfully with the process of mourning and letting go in times of great loss and it was also so marvelously suspenseful in certain parts that it was still a great read!
B00006F7S4|4.0|I can't help thinking that Beck's current release points out precisely what is so irritating about so much critical commentary.  It seems that reviewers, professional and amateur alike, are more interested in playing &quot;Spot The Influence,&quot;in which they show off their vast knowledge of musical history, than they are in reviewing the work at hand.  Yes, artists are not born in a vacuum and, as such, they are influenced by other artists.  So, while Beck's new album is compared to everyone from Nick Drake to Nirvana, reviewers miss the larger point:  the album which sounds like everything sounds like almost nothing else currently available to the listener. <BR>     Much has been made of the sameness of the album's tracks, but they are, in fact, similar without being the same.  &quot;Every song sounds alike&quot; is an easy charge to level at music that one is not really listening closely to.  I am as guilty of this as anyone and I initially felt that way about Sea Change, too.  In particular, I thought that The Golden Age and Guess I'm Doing Fine were virtually indistinguishable from each other.  Now, after repeated listenings, I can't imagine I ever felt that way.<BR>     It is true that the album has basically one pace.  I think that if one lifted any single song from the cd and put it on a more varied, mixed cd it might have a totally different impact on the listener.  The songs may suffer from their proximity to each other but, again, I think that is only a problem for those who wanted a different album from Beck to begin with.<BR>     It doesn't rock, and it clearly wasn't supposed to, but neither is it the kind of elevator/dentist office muzak it's being touted as in some reviews.  It is melancholy but most assuredly not depressing (there is a difference!).  It is frequently inspired and Beck's voice is remarkable, even in the mumbled bits.
B0000214F2|4.0|This film is based on the true story of Hunter \\"Patch\\" Adams.  Adams wanted to help people, and to do, so he tried to re-align the way doctors see their role with patients.  Rather than maintaining a distance between doctor and patient, Adams felt that doctors should be more compassionate and understanding.  At the time, this was a revolutionary idea.  His dream, from what I read, is still in the process of becoming a reality.<br />Robin Williams, playing Adams, gives a lot of life to this role.  As in other roles, Williams doesn't keep to the comic side of the role but explores the other extreme as well.  We can see and feel his pain.  Williams is very good at taking us through the whole spectrum of emotion.<br />A problem I have with the movie is some elements are too similar to other movies Williams has done.  For instance, if you remember the scene in \\"Dead Poets Society\\" where all the students are showing their support, then you have seen a version of this movie.  You can't help but make the connection.<br />I would recommend seeing this movie.  If you see the special edition, there is behind-the-scenes footage at the end.

B00003CXBH|5.0|I have been searching for the DVD version of The Mission for a long time.  Why aren't the producers releasing this on DVD??? The Mission is by far the most thought provoking, poignant, spiritually uplifting, emotionally engaging movies of all time.  Not to mention spectacular cinematography and the most haunting score Ennio Morricone has ever written.  <br />Only a DVD format will do this movie justice.  And I certainly will not cave by buying this on VHS.<br />De Niro and Irons play Jesuit priests entangled in a time of political and religious conflicts in South America.  The crux of the film is when they deal with &quot;God's Will&quot; in the only way they know how: when political ambitions marginalise native society through destruction - one fights for his beliefs and religion by the sword while the other defends by the cross.   <br />It will be a service to movie buffs everywhere if the producers could release this on DVD NOW.
B000002ADT|5.0|I received this CD as a gift, and my first reaction was, &quot;Oh. It's just jazz,&quot; and I promptly forgot about the CD, which displayed my own ignorance about Miles AND this album. Then, after sifting through my stack of discs for something new to play in my car one day, I found &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and thought I'd give it a try.<br />On first listen, it was nice. I hate to say that because some people think a listener should be bowled over by this album once the disc is in the player. That didn't happen to me. Instead, I discovered a melancholy mood in the album that I would come back to again, and again, and again, until I was literally being plunged into a trance every time I listened to the album. That is what I mean when I say, &quot;I have arrived.&quot; I finally FEEL the album. It's now a part of me. Once the song &quot;So What&quot; comes on, I am in a rhythmic hallucination, awash in subtle trumpet tones, sax phrases, piano comp, drum fills, and I feel like I finally know what people mean when they call this album the most influential jazz album of all time.<br />Now, when you listen to this CD, I don't expect you to feel the same way at the same time I did. You may arrive sooner than I did, or you may get there later. However, if you buy this album, and you appreciate jazz even in its most basic forms, you will arrive, my friend. You will arrive.
6305252521|5.0|Anyone who thinks this is merely a movie about a guy in a reality TV show who one day figures out its all a big lie - will be pleasantly surprised.<br />Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who's unknowingly growing up in a perfect town that's really a huge TV set in a reality TV series called 'The Truman Show'.  <br />To maintain the ongoing viewership of this reality show, its producer Cristoff (Harris) utilises control elements (actors, special effects) to condition Truman to lead his life around established parameters that form the general TV plot.  <br />For example, Truman's true love (Natascha McElhone i think) is purposefully edged out of his life by her 'father' (you can't see her anymore, she's going to Fiji) and Truman's eventual wife (Linney), when McElhone's character decides to tell Truman the truth about his role in the reality show. <br />And when Truman expresses a desire to go to Fiji to find his love, his 'best friend' tells him there is no need to venture beyond their shores, that everything is so perfect the way it is, and that they can enjoy perfect sunsets every single day...  why ask for more, why go to Fiji?  <br />And when Truman shows early signs of adventure and decides to go sailing, Cristoff cooks up a storm at 'sea' and drowns his 'father' in an attempt to snuff out his quest for adventure.<br />But you just can't keep a good man down.  Eventually, the human spirit triumphs, despite all the negativity, assumptions and established parameters we face everyday and know as 'Life'.<br />Ironically, the millions of viewers who have grown up with Truman and seen his highs and lows on reality TV, cry and cheer for Truman when he eventually triumphs and leaves the movie set.  He leaves everything that is perfect but empty behind, and steps into the big black unknown alone, but full of hope and expectancy.  The finale will get you crying and cheering along with the movie's TV audience.<br />Quite simply, The Truman Show is about <BR>- questioningassumptions and what is seemingly the truth<BR>- how everyone loves a hero but doesn't dare to be one themselves<BR>- how fulfilling dreams take courage and faith in the face of negativity and adversity<BR>- asking yourself what you can change in your life<br />Peter Weir ties together these life lessons without being overly didactic - which is why many people miss the point of this movie.<br />The Truman Show is certainly an underrated, misunderstood movie that has been intelligently and poignantly delivered.  Go see it today.
B000002O1P|5.0|Southern Accents is strangely one of Petty`s best records, but with the least amount of hits coming out. How come? All the songs on this CD is smashing! <BR>Personal Favorites here are songs like &quot;Don`T come around here no more&quot;, &quot;Southern Accents&quot;, &quot;Spike&quot;, &quot;Dogs on the Run&quot; and &quot;Best of Everything&quot;. The rest of the songs are good, in fact pretty good too. <BR>&quot;Southern Accents&quot; is probably one of the most beautiful songs Tom Petty ever has made. It is a lonely and moody piano, expressing the purest thing in the musical world, just a man and his closest friend, his instrument. <BR>&quot;Spike&quot; is a funny and kind of &quot;Sleazy&quot; song, it kind of reminds me of gangsters. Never known why.<BR>&quot;Dogs on the Run&quot; it starts of like the best of upbeat rockers, the intro just does it best to make you remember the intro. It is Great!<BR>All the songs on the album has their own style, none are alike, and this makes &quot;Southern Accents&quot; Tom Petty`s most varied album ever. And one of his strongest.

B000065V1V|5.0|\\"Heathen\\" is a sigh of relief for hard-core Bowie fans that couldn't attach themselves to all of his more recent style focused albums.  I'm just a novice so I might not speak for everyone.  For my money, I loved Bowie's erratic electronica meets satire on \\"Earthling\\" yet didn't fall in love with the mostly adult contemporary rock with middle aged blues of \\"Hours...\\".  However, \\"Heathen\\" is a much more widespread musical effort that includes spacy electro pop (the obscure cover \\"Took A Ride On A Gemini Spacecraft\\") to blistering alt-rock guitar (his take on Neil Young's \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\").  In fact, Bowie has a lot of success with covers.  He sounds malicious yet passionate while ripping through the Pixies \\"Cactus\\", one of Bowie's better sounding alt-rock tracks in a few years.  It blows away anything Tin Machine attempted because while it is hard rocking, it has real compassion in its darkness.  The album has a lot of great upbeat rockers like the soulful \\"Slow Burn\\" and pop rock of \\"Afraid\\", which might have a familiar intro from recent commercials Bowie has done for satellite radio.  The theme of \\"Heathen\\" seems to be about needing to be loved, which can be heard in songs like dark \\"I Would Be Your Slave\\" and soothing \\"Slip Away\\".  The album is erratic yet it works very well with a strong selection of songs that come from all areas.  Many of the songs are somewhat worldly like the bouncy carrousel rock beats of \\"A Better Future\\" and the ominous \\"Heathen (The Rays)\\".  The album can be described as Bowie-esque, which to me means that it is diverse in sound yet about a lot of deep themes (death, paranoia, aging, sexuality, innocence and dozens more).  Bowie knows how to blend emotion with all different types of music and does it extremely well on one album!<br />The only problem that \\"Heathen\\" has is it is too short considering there were so many tracks that could have been on here.  There are 4 non-album tracks that didn't make the US cut which appear on the \\"Slow Burn\\" import single.  Of those, the best (in my opinion) is the newly recorded \\"You've Got A Habit Of Leaving\\", a soulfully pop rock track that is passionately emotive yet lovable.  There are other strong songs like \\"Woody Jackson\\", which fit the isolation theme of the album.  Also, the special edition, which it appears is being re-released in November, features a great re-recording of \\"Panic In Detroit\\", a slightly funky rock track that you hear Bowie sing a great melody that wasn't heard on the \\"Aladdin Sane\\" version.  It's a little bit cleaner than the original and more modern.  Even if you buy this basic CD, you will be in for a treat of many shades of rock, pop, grunge, AC, electronic and even blues that display many human yearnings for lust, belonging, fear and showcases the great struggle that is life.  This one is a Bowie album that everyone will find something they love about it.
B000021Y77|3.0|I challenge anyone to fall asleep watching this movie!  The combination of the techno-beat soundtrack and Lola running feels like it should be as bad for you as looking directly at strobe lighting.  The main idea behind the movie has been done many times before - having the chance to re-live the same day again to reach a different conclusion.  The director shows us how coincidence and chance affect outcomes.  This isn't a film for realists, fans of great dialogue or character development.  But if you think you would enjoy watching a movie that grabs you by your senses and shakes you up, you could do a lot worse.
B00005JGAB|5.0|First off. I don't really view the Ramones as a &quot;Punk&quot; band. If you really listen to them it's basically surfing music played really, loud and really fast. Now I'm probably in the minority on this one. With that said. This album rocks. hard. from start to finish.  One of the best albums ever.
B000007OY0|5.0|Although this movie contains all the usual prison cliches - wardens who are related to satan himself and in-mates who you should definitely never put your back to, this film is head and shoulders above every other prison movie I have ever seen.  The reason this film is ALWAYS quoted on the 10 ten best movies ever made is the sheer humanity of it.  \\"Start living or start dying\\", its about never giving up hope, the power of friendship and about getting what you deserve if you have the strength to reach out for it.  If you don't own this movie, buy it today!  I challenge you to get to the end with out a tear in your eye.
B00005U2JL|5.0|...\\"Guns, God, and Government is a rare look at one of the world's most controversial artist's lifestyles both on and off the stage.  Shot throughout the U.S., Japan, Russia, and Europe this DVD spotlights the performance that has made Manson truly infamous.  This DVD contains features which gives the viewer an 'All Access Pass' to off stage life and a glimpse behind the scenes as the tour takes the band from Tokyo to Berlin, Moscow to Rome, London to New York and everywhere in between.\\"... The Death Parade is a 30 minute short film of the band's trip around around the world with the Guns, God, and Government World Tour.  This includes Manson's trip to the Emergency Room, Degenerate Sexual Behavior, the first acoustic performance of \\"GodEatGod\\" in NYC, Manson performing with Eminem, and Burning Flag.  There are many more shorts in The Death Parade including various concert footage, backstage happenings, lots of nudity, and religious people in the streets trying to ban Manson's concerts.<br />The total running time is approxamately 107 minutes.  Audio options for the DVD include Stero, 5.1 and DTS.  Overall, a very good show from Marilyn Manson.  He puts a lot of energy into his shows and you'll see it on this DVD.  So much energy that after the concert is over, he can't even stand on his own two feet!  If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed.  In the words of Manson, \\"This will help you see what it's like to be nailed to this wrecking ball\\".
B00006IU73|4.0|No doubt this is a great cd, in fact, their best ever. The great vocal harmonies, big production, beautiful melodies, great musicianship and big sound place them in company of the best of progessive groups in the last ten years (Flower Kings and Spocks Beard). So, why the four stars instead of five as almost all of the rest reviewers rated this cd? The very heavy guitar riffs (reaching metal status)destroys the flow of what, otherwise, will be great songs.An example of this is the beginning and end of Blackest eyes and Gravity eyelids; then come the nonsense Wedding Nails and The creator has a mastertape.The problem with most progressive groups nowadays is that they have to introduce distorted guitar sounds and noises (although they are very good guitarists)to please the Metal &amp; Hard Rock fanatics craving for that type of music. Porcupine Tree does not need to do that to produce good music (listen to the Sound of Muzak), as Genesis very well exemplified in the Hackett guitar solo in Firth of Fifth. Still, I recommend this record for the great songs that are not contaminated with the very heavy guitar sound.
1577311523|5.0|The ideas put forth here are certainly enlightening, open mindedness and at the same time a slither of narrowing life down a tad more than I can accept. Eckhart does not come right out and say forget the past and future but effectively is nullifying such alternatives or more optional highways to true spiritual awareness. Life is a matriz and is broad, we cannot confine it to any one area or time frame. Living for the moment may turn out to be some what of a regression for many in that it leaves out...where we've been and more importantly where we could, would and should be heading. Now I'm not so biased to say that Tolle does not convey this, however I do feel to much is placed on right now not reflecting on who we are from our historical learned \\"Life\\". I was not born today, more or less yesterday, but 67 years ago. Those 67 years are being nullified by this way of thinking in a searching for the now sense.<BR>   The Book is not a Money Grabber, it is eloquently and brilliantly written and a pleasing format attracts the reader. I believe the authors did have contributory intent. As a literary agent I am aware of the various reasons books sell or aren't allowed to sell. I am pleased this book has done so well, but take in mind if a book is advertised as this one has been, it will get purchased. I am not saying this book is not selling for it's content, however the advertising holds the weight of this scale. Without the promo's this book has recieved it would never found its way to the top. I am giving 5 stars for the sincere effort, but will not allow myself to forget the past as part of my search for a spiritual future. ...

0375414053|5.0|From sneaking out to find a tellytubbie cake to business trips with no notice to missing pap smears for 4 years, I am seeing my harried life unfold in this novel. Any working mother can relate to Kate's life. One of my favorite lines is when she is discussing loss of her short term memory yet she has uncanny total recall of the names of every celebrity's baby. But what I relate most to is the good mother/bad mother debate (stay at home/working mother)and how she lies to her mother in law about her daughter's love of broccoli (if she tells her she doesn't know then she's a bad mother/If she tells her she doesn't like it, then she's a bad mother). There is one laugh (& sigh) after another. Finally a book that truly depicts the life of a working mom. I wish my boss, husband, & brothers would read it, but they're guys so they won't understand.  Any woman contemplating staying at home versus working should read this book- Please!
0446677450|4.0|I came across this book 2 days after I had sold my house, since I had realized it really was a liability in tough times, not an asset, and read it within 2 days after that again.<br />Mr. Kiyosaki has some good, common-sense advice on how to manage your personal finances; he weighs opposing common points of view - personalized through his two dads - and talks about the consequences. Interesting reading all of it, not the least because we get his two dads as figures we can peg the viewpoints onto.<br />If I should sum up his advice, it is that financial success has nothing to do with how much money you start with; rather, it's whether you have the right mindset. When you see a dollar, what do you see in your mind's eye? <br />His suggested mindset for success is that of an investor, not stopping at &quot;I can't&quot; but rather asking &quot;How can I?&quot;, looking at all money matters through the eyes of an investor. It makes sense: If you start a company, would that company buy a car and a fur coat first, or would it reinvest in itself until a very affordable piece of its cash flow sufficed for the car and the coat?<br />He also has some very interesting viewpoints on learning which I agree with. The current school system was designed in Germany by Bismarck and his bureaucrats to make good ants - workers and soldiers - rather than being fit for people who want to make a living in our reasonably free society. It's no coincidence that the percentage of entrepreneurs actually go down with years of education rather than up. I say this with defiance, though, as I am a PhD who intend to go against the stream.<br />On the downside, I think the book is poorly structured. As he himself says, he is a best-selling writer and not a best-writing one. There are repetitions, fragmentation, and I as a reader did not get a good feel of sectioning of knowledge. From someone appreciating intelligence and learning the way Kiyosaki does, I would have expected a better structured presentation.

1559408898|5.0|Even though I was a child of the 80's (born '83), I never got around to watching Robocop until 2000, even though I had heard of it.<br />The movie simply blew me away! I was expecting a b-flick with a robot walking around shooting people.<br />This movie happens to have one of the most unique stories ever written. I wasn't expecting it to have one, and I was pleasently suprised.<br />The Robocop costume is one of the coolest things I have seen in a film. The director even went so far as to hire an advisor to tell Peter Weller (Murphy/Robocop) how to move properly as a robot.<br />There is excellent acting all-around, a very unique score, and some of the best special effects in any movie.<br />Did I mention the violence? This movie is one of the most gory films ever made, and the Criterion version adds to that. However, the violence in the movie is realistic (what do you expect when a man is shot to pieces with four 20mm cannons?)<br />I've watched this movie at least ten times, and I watched it three consective days when I initially rented it. I wanted the criterion version badly (It's hard to watch the other editions when you have already seen the director's cut) ...

B00005AR3G|5.0|I really thought this movie would be so dumb, but I about die laughing every time I see it.  It is just so hilariously random!  I mean, who comes up with these stories . . . A prince who gets turned into a llama?  Weird, but SO funny!  I don't even have kids, but I had to get it anyway.
B000068IEU|1.0|I know we can't like or hate the same movies, but this movie is not worth anybody's time of day. It could have been so much better if the atmosphere and music had been arranged more effectively. The music used is so bad that it's hard to imagine what the director was thinking - it's supposed to be a horror story, not a love story. Possibly, the use of nightime in some scenes would have created a more scary atmosphere. Nearly all scenes are daylight . Aside from that, the acting from the girls does not present any fear from their side. It gets worse though, the parent's acting doesn't show them as grief stricken,and the actor who played the mother was totally miscast. A very amateurish effect overall. While it remains banned in some countries (and may be the reason why it is considered a cult-classic), it was made way back when censorship laws were very tough. I had always wanted to see this, because it was a Wes Craven movie - but be warned, it's not at all as scary as they promise on the back cover.  Wes Craven really hasn't made a decent movie when you think about it.   Just rent this one  if you have to see it. Definitely not worthy of cult-classic status.  DVD has some features which are its only saving grace.
0792833236|5.0|'Raging Bull' is unlike most sports films.  It deals with the aftermath of glory, the days after the lights, women, and success are all over.  Although most of 'Raging Bull' is about Jake La Motta's successful boxing carrer, the point of the movie it the battle to survive.  Scorsese uncompromisingly explores the dark years when Jake becomes a nobody and everthing is lost.  The latter section is not the most exciting part, but it is the most meaningful.<br />In this life there is success and failure, and it seems like most people are never very successful.  Most people will never make the front page news nor ever do anything extraordinary.  The most touching point, I think, the film makes is that success and failure are not really that important.  What is important is survival.  Surviving and then moving on.
0061020710|3.0|I admit that I did not read this series in order.  Fortunately, I started with #8 Guards, Guards! which is a first book for Pratchett's City Watch series.  The Color of Magic, though not among the best, is still good - a necessary introduction to the Discworld. This is where I first met Rincewind and the Luggage.  I have not read the later book about Agatea, Twoflower's country of birth, but I can't wait to see what life is like there.

0061020680|4.0|As he writes, Pratchett is getting better.  This is a pretty good book.  Death is always comical - it's hard not be when you always have to speak in uppercase letters.  Mort is a decent character, and his adventures in Sto Lat and Sto Helit are very funny. I really liked the young wizard Cutwell, too.  He was a riot.  Now we know that Death can sometimes bend the rules a bit.
6305313687|5.0|American History X is probably one of the most profound works of art I have ever seen. This is the kind of movie that transcends \\"movie\\" and becomes \\"film.\\" It is hard to watch at some times; it is amazing at the same time. The main character \\"Derek,\\" masterfully played by Edward Norton, is a white supremacist, who has gone to prison for killing an African-American. After immerging from his time in prison, Derek, has found that his little brother \\"Danny,\\" played by Terminator target Edward Furlong, has followed in his big brother's ways and has become a skin-head. The story follows as Derek, having recovered from his former ways, as he tries to show Danny that there is a better way to see the world. The film is so very strong in every aspect. The \\"Sweeney\\" character played by Star Trek: Deep Space Nine veteran, Avery Brooks, is another voice of strength in thin movie. Every character fits their role to perfection. <br />This film is going to go down in history in as a classic. I cannot lie; this movie is hard to watch. I mean in no way that it is at any point, of low quality. The subject matter is touchy, it is violent and, the film drops the \\"N\\" word more times than I can count. But, like all great movies, dialog is imperative to plot. This film is one of hope. It may not seem it at first glance, but watch the whole movie, it is so very worth it. This movie will make you cry. And if it doesn't, you did not watch it close enough. Watch it again. This movie is not for kids, but young adults should see it. It has so much to offer. It is so blatantly proof that \\"life is too short to be [ticked] off all the time.\\"<br />epc

0792844602|1.0|It's surprising someone as steeped in North African history as reviewer Kennedy can so brashly miss the point of this colonialist antique. The point is not the Mahdi: whether he was a nice guy by Western standards or not. The point is British colonial rule over a foreign land and people. After all, the Mahdi might expire the next day and be replaced by someone more benevolent, yet British rule with all its onerous White Man's burden would remain intact, as it in fact did. Moreover, the politics of Four Feathers are as  inseparable from the adventure yarn as John Wayne's superpatriotism is from The Alamo. Four Feathers simply assumes the British  right to colonial conquest, such that the viewer is led uncritically to side with white-skinned Europeans over dark-skinned Nubians, despite the Nubian struggle to free themselves. Never is the axiom of might-makes-right questioned, nor is the humanity of the native tribes or their culture even implied. Reviewer Camelface is correct. The natives exist only as cartoonish cannon fodder for the big guns of the British, faceless, fanatical stage props dying like flies to reassure Western audiences of their own superiority. In short, ruthless colonial conquest is justified under the guise of an A-budget adventure yarn. No matter how well produced, such mock heroics remain unadulterated 19th century propaganda, the understandable target of nativist movements world-wide seeking to reestablish their own identity and their own culture in the face of continuing Western aggression. The fact that these colonial values continue to resonate with Western audiences, as exemplified by reviewer Kennedy, is a lamentable commentary on our present  downward arc. Nor is it an accident that this hoariest of screenplays has been resurrected in wide-screen sensurround, the better to cheer on the seizure of Iraqi oil under the banner of enlightened Western despotism. On such dreary occasions I'm led to agree with Gandhi. While visiting England later in life he was asked what he thought of Western civilization, to which he replied, \\"I think it would be a good idea\\". A comment as unfortunately true now as it was then.in life he was asked what he thought of Western civilization, to which he replied, \\"I think it would be a good idea\\".

I then picked up &quot;Summerteeth&quot; and &quot;Being There.&quot; Equally great, particularly &quot;Summerteeth.&quot; These guys draw on so many diverse elements and put it together...forget about it...words aren't enough to describe the pure joy of listening to Wilco.

B00005UEAR|4.0|This album had it's ups and downs, but who is to really tell how a band should play.  Either you like it or you don't.  I liked it.  I didn't like scenes from a memory.  The thing is, it is still a musicians piece of artwork, and who are we to tell an artist how he should do his art.  I think that any album this band put out is their heart-felt feelings.  How can you tell them what they should or shouldn't feel.  Let them go do their thing.  If you don't like it, don't buy it!
B000001C6M|5.0|Well this is the first slayer album and it has some definite punk sensibilities (production is crude, guitars don't have much crunch.) But this album has The Antichrist and Black Magic which are two of the best songs in metal history. Araya uses that wild rising howl the most in this album that is really a trademark of early Slayer (akin to that of Tom G Warrior's 'OUGH!') Even in this stage Slayer had a very unique style of thrash metal.

B00005UWCV|5.0|First of all, if we're talking about technical accuracy, this isn't a Disney movie.  It's Fox Home Entertainment.  Don Bluth (An American Tail, The Secret of NIMH, Titan AE - all not Disney) hasn't worked for Disney in ages, as far as I know.  Second, it's fiction.  If you're looking for a historical account, this isn't it.  Good parents explain the difference between fiction and fact to their children, and smart adults figure it out on their own.<br />All that aside, I (an adult), really enjoy this movie.    The heroine is intelligent, funny, and perfectly capable of standing on her own two feet.  She's vulnerable, but strong... a great \\"role model\\".  The supposedly useless villain has some clever, if disgusting, scenes and lines.  The cute sidekick (a fruit bat) nearly steals the movie!  The soundtrack has some wonderful sing-along songs, the dialogue is quick, and the animation is strong (although not incredible).  The only caution I have is that I wouldn't recommend the movie for small children... there are some scenes that will probably scare them to death (notably a creepy dream sequence, and a disturbing rotting-body song and dance by the villain).<br />If you like animation, particularly of the musical sort (i.e. Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, An American Tail), I highly recommend this one.  It's just plain fun
B000021Y77|4.0|To me the most interesting philisophical aspect of this film isn't the obvious one presented. That of \\"small seemingly insignifigant events can alter our destinies\\" (or the flapping of a butterflies wings can cause a hurricane). <br />Rather than focus on that I found myself enthralled by Lola's physical plight through the streets of Berlin. It seemed as a microcosm for life itself. It was a road movie with an overexerted heartbeat. If you don't think this movie was deep I think you may have to take a closer look. <br />The part that set my head spinning was during the third story when Lola has absolutely zero solutions for her situation and asks herself \\"what should I do now?...Keep Running.\\" Don't we tell ourselves that in some form everyday of our lives. Motion making us cancel out the fact that we may be on infinite auto pilot. Motion cancelling out the fact that at the end of the  day we are all going to die anyway. <br />Some people have said that the running became dull or redundant but honestly those are the parts of the film that challanged me to go inside of myself most of all. On top of that this film is truly cinematic (unlike most made these days) and has a driving techno soundtrack. <br />Sometimes actions speak louder than words..and in this case that is proved to the 110th degree.
0790736586|5.0|Climbing back into the saddle after a nine year break from Westerns Clint Eastwood shows us he is the best in the business when it comes to this genre.In this outing he takes not only to the saddle but to the Directors chair,and the result is a visually spectacular and wholly atmospheric story.<BR>The setting is Northern California,1860,(though the film was actually shot on location in Idaho's Sawtooth National Park)and centres around a group of gold-miners in a place called Carbon Canyon,the last area of land where mining mogul Coy LaHood(Richard Dysart) hasn't been able to set up his land-scarring hydraulic monitors.Even after numerous raids by his workers the stubborn 'tin panners' refuse to leave.But their resolve is waning.<BR>A young girl(Sydney Penny),strong in her faith,prays for a miracle after a particulary brutal raid one morning.Enter Clint Eastwood.<BR>I have watched this movie many times and still I am unsure of Clints character.And that's why this movie works.His aloof and mysterious 'Preacher',all the way through,begs the question is he real or is he a ghost?A suggestive script opens doors to this mans past but he himself coyly skirts around any direct answers with a dry mono-syllabic dialogue as to his true identity.He becomes an enigma to us,while outwardly to the miners of Carbon Canyon he becomes a savior in a clerical collar who seems to know how to use a six-shooter to full effect.<BR>The two main female characters,Sarah Wheeler(Carrie Snodgress) and her daughter Megan(Sydney) are drawn to this lone stranger which causes a somewhat awkward sub-plot to the story but I feel it is entirely plausible and makes you really understand what motivates these two richly drawn characters.Alot of the female roles in Westerns are one-dimensional,Sarah and Megan are anything but.<BR>After negotiations fail between LaHood and the tin-pans Coy enlists the services of a corrupt Marshal(the late John Russell) and his six Deputies to rid the canyon of this troublesome Preacher.The showdown is set,and amidst the spectacular backdrop of the snow swept mountains and an eerie wind that you can almost feel the Preacher drops the Deputies one by one as they hunt for him in the small town of LaHood.Then he finally reveals himself to the Marshal,who up til now has had his suspicions as to his identity.\\"But the man I'm thinking of is dead\\" he tells Coy earlier in the scene.<BR>As the Preacher lifts his head,the shadow of his hat-brim taking flight and revealing a stubbled face with cold penetrating eyes Marshal Stockburn is clearly shocked.\\"You!\\" he stammers.And here we realise that indeed these two men have met before and a few pieces of the puzzle fall into place as to the Preachers history,but somehow he remains as enigmatic as ever.<BR>This story is just that well written.<BR>If you haven't seen this movie I won't spoil it by explaining the ending,but it is reminiscient of Shane in some respects.I highly recommend this classic Western,by far,in my opinion,the best one ever made.

B00003OSSL|4.0|It is apparent from the wide range of responses to this movie that its intention and meaning is insufficiently defined.  Much of the blame here must go to Harrison Ford and whoever cast him.  (He reached his peak in American Graffiti.  His career constitutes absolute proof of H. L. Mencken's maxim that no one every went broke underestimating the taste of the American public-and he could have added the American Academy of Motion Pictures.)  The central theme of the movie could be uncontrollable suspicion and unhealable scars resulting from the trauma of spousal betrayal OR it could be redemption through a human connection resulting from two people having had a common life-changing experience.  Ford, with his two-expression range (dumb and befuddled intermixed with an occasional twisted pseudo-smile), is simply unable to portray either.  He never really connects with Thomas (who does her usual superb job), he just doggedly goes about pursuing the details of his dead wife's affair while looking confused and sullen, whereas the movie needed a male lead who could speak clearly without words.  It is interesting to speculate on the oucome had Ford's character been played by someone appropriate, say Russell Crow, Brad Pitt, Daniel Day Lewis, or Al Pacino.  <br />Nonetheless, the issue addressed is not superficial and could even be profound.  Consequently, I believe that this film had considerable potential, and despite Ford's incompetence, for that reason, has some value.
0671027573|5.0|First of all, this book is very easy to read, that gives it a star, the point number two is that you will laugh a lot while you read, that is another star, it has a very nice love story (exactly two love stories but the one that counts is jaine's) that is the star number three, it is a real thriller, a police book, a book that show you what is the meaning of friendship, that is the star number four, and the last star is for the finish of the book, you will never think of that finish until you read the last chapter.

The Aussies are rabid about their ballroom dancing, and this movie pokes gentle fun at their obsession with classy wit that is incisive and yet endearing. The whole movie is stocked with super performances in this tale of the ugly ducking turning into a swan simply because she wants to dance ballroom. The characters, editing and delivery of all the actors keep this on the cutting edge that make it one you will want to view again and again.<br />Absolutely one of the best!!!
B000002UTI|3.0|The only thing I was dissapointed about was that Track 1, &quot;Real Love,&quot; is NOT the demo that Paul, George, and Ringo used for the Anthology. It is a different acoustic recording. But, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is good. It doesn't have the cheering at the beginning, or the gibberish at the end, which is good if you want to burn it onto a CD without having to put &quot;Sgt. Pepper Reprise&quot; before it. The &quot;Imagine Rehearsal&quot; is an interesting track, since it has bits of talking, like The Beatles' Anthologies. They are pretty good songs, but they should have included &quot;Instant Karma.&quot;
B00000JHAU|5.0|Many people believe that Belle & Sebastian are pretentious rip-offs of other, better musicians (Velvet Underground, Nick Drake...etc.) but, I believe that this album (along with Tigermilk) truly proves the range and the heart that this band posesses. Although they are obviously influenced by these incredible bands of the past, they are very stylized and original in many cases. The high point of the album (for me) is \\"Get me away from here I'm dying\\"...not only is it arranged beautifully, but the lyrics represent the emotions of everyone at one point or another. Overall, this album is well worth your time, and after getting past the obvious overtones of great bands, you learn to accept them as a good band all by themselves.
B000003TAR|5.0|...well, I still have a likeness for artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, but there's no denying that you can't get Nirvana's music out of your head while listening to the likes of the aritsts mentioned above. If it wasn't for that day that my bro came into my room with a new copy of \\"In Utero\\". He said to me that if I didn't slap this in a CD player and listen to it  right away, I'd probably beat my own a$$ senseless for not knowing the fact that such incredible music was actually made.<BR> I was listening to Marilyn Manson on my stereo, but I just went ahead and grabbed my CD player and then inserted what is perhaps the most important object I'll have ever come across in my life. I pressed play...oh my god. OH MY GODD! I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT It was so incredible to me to find out music can acutally sound this good! It came to no suprise to me as I ended up sitting there listening to the whole thing while I forgot what I had been listening to in the first place. What have I been doing my whole life without the knowing fact that this existed?<BR> So let it be said: Nirvana is the best band to have ever roamed thisw planet. You can't even come onto this review list to try and see a bad review. It's impossible. These guys are the type of guys who only get 4 to 5 star reviews (but if you wanna good laugh, you should check out the 1 to 2 star reviews for Limp Bizkit's \\"Chocolate Starfish\\").
B00005JKCF|4.0|The classic comic book character finally comes to life in this intense action movie starring Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, aka Spider Man.  After the tremendous film 'X-Men,' this movie had a tough act to follow, but it did it quite well.  This is good old fashioned comic book fun!<br />Most everyone knows the story of Spider-man--little, wimpy kid gets bit by spider and suddenly gets all kinds of cool powers.  This film tells the story of Spider-man, from the moment he gets bit to the time he establishes himself as the newest addition to the superhero world.<br />This would have been a tough movie to make.  Maybe that's why they waited until they could do most of it by computer animation--the stunts would just be too complicated otherwise.  Even though parts of the film do look a little fake, hey, it's a comic book character.  What do you expect?<br />Overall, Spider-Man is good, quality comic book entertainment!  If you liked the movie 'X-Men,' this is right up your alley! This is definitely one you'll want to see, and, if you're into these kinds of movies, would make an excellent addition to your DVD collection.
B00006IUL7|5.0|this has been the most engrossing thriller i have seen since &quot;seven&quot; was released! the production/cinematography is outstanding... the plot is rewarding... and the acting is compelling. if you like thickly atmospheric storytellin then this is somethin you need to look into...
B000002UEB|5.0|This is a true album, not a collection of songs stuck together.  The music goes together, and, while there are singles here, is meant to be listened to all at once.  This is Queensryche at their best, and is hard rock at its most creative.<br />This is what has been called a 'Rock Opera,' a collection of songs that are each part of a larger story.  The story of this album is rich, and the music flows smoothly from one track to another.  I've heard it compared to Pink Floyd, and while I think the concept of a story (like the Wall) is definitely similar, the music is nothing like anything Floyd ever did.<br />Geoff Tate has a voice that is absolutely astounding, and Chris DiGarmo's guitar roars right alongside it.  The rhythm section of the band follows nicely, and hammers out a steady beat throughout the album.  By itself, the music is great, but add the story and you've got yourself a rock masterpiece! <br />This is one of the best hard rock albums of all time, and definitely among the top 'concept albums' ever!  If you're a hard rock or metal fan, don't miss this spectacular album!
B00006EXDM|5.0|So many review writers seem to obsess about the sound quality and re-mastering of many Original Recordings including this excellent compilation.  Where some people may find such commentary helpful, I think in most cases it detracts from the bottom line which is quality of the songs and the artists creativity at the time.<br />As at least one reviewer previously mentioned, this compilation indeed is very well representative of the top songs from the Rolling Stones glory period between 1964 and 1971.  Each chosen track is very appropriate and there are really no glaring ommissions.<br />For those who appreciate the more modern sounds of this fine band, you might want to pick up the new Forty Licks collection.  However, if you want a focused collection  of the bands greatest hits from their peak years only, this is the perfect purchase.<br />Its mostly rock n roll(a few ballads) but you'll like it.  Of coure if you are a big time fan just buy all their original releases such as Let It Bleed, Beggars Banquet, Sticky Fingers, etc.
0679441018|3.0|This one was disappointing to me. I thought it better than Tales of the Body Thief, but that is not saying a whole lot.  I think a lot of the problem is that I am just getting tired of L'Estat's whining, and tortured, repentant vampires in general, even when they do meet god and the devil.

B000000LZV|5.0|In a way, it's ridiculous to write a Minutemen review, because anyone who reads it already knows them and loves them, and they're obscure enough that those who don't know them probably never will.<BR>But people are irrational, and extraordinary music motivates them to do pointless stuff.  And as a chance browser might scroll down the \\"double nickels\\" page, they'd see the same outlandish, superlative claims over and over \\"an incredible album!\\" \\"Best of the 80's\\" (I would agree) and so on.<BR>The thing is, though, it really IS one of the best albums of all time, and one of the greatest BANDS of all time.  The musicianship is incredibly good for a \\"punk band\\" (though most Minutemen afficionados would say that they went far beyond the genre, which they did)- super tight, super creative, heartwrenchingly soulful, intellectually challenging.  The songs sweep stylistically from straight rock to jam rock to hardcore to jazz to avant garde to latin to flamenco classical, and each song nails it- a jazzman who lent an ear would say, \\"this is darn good jazz\\".  A punker would say, \\"these guys can bring it\\".  Andres Segovia would say \\"dang it, dawg, my homey D. Boon can really play(of course he'd say that!)\\".<BR>But the thing about rock is that a rock band is more than just music- it's words, and an album cover, and tours, and who the guys were, and how much money they made, and the whole package of life, really.  And there is no band that, through all these things, made a more powerful statement about themselves, about life, and about what's important in life, than the Minutemen.  I learned more in my first year of college from the one word \\"Minutemen\\" than I did in all my classes, or anything.  To whit:<BR>About politics- Politics is subordinate to morality, and is a means, never an end. What matters is right and wrong, not right and left.<BR>About music- Aim high.  Music is a highest art form, even if it's punk rock.  It deserves to be treated as such.  <BR>About how to do a cover song- Do two things- one, find a creative facet that makes the song special and acknowledge it and magnify it, to credit the original artist.  Two, credit the song by giving some creative facet of your own to it.  All the covers on the record do this, even CCR's \\"Don't look now\\"- perhaps Fogerty's harshest lesson to his audience.  Putting it in a live setting, with Boon singing solo, and the sound of the audience not listening, and chatting, and ignoring the lessson, gives the song incredible force.<BR>About friendship- Realize that true friendship is an incredible, beautiful gift.  Acknowledge your friends, vocally, publicly support them, and tell them you love them, because you never know when they're going to die in a car crash.<BR>About life in general- Live it like a work of art, as Ghandi said.  Try your fricken damndest in everything you do.  Aim high, yet at the same time, manage to remember the humor in life- take lightly what comes to you.  And when you do live it right, don't worry about being a little proud of yourself.  The reason Mike Watt is a little preachy nowadays is because he knows what he did with the Minutemen, and it's something that few, very few, ever come close to.  And when he preaches, I listen, more than I would any Rolling Stone, for example- while Keith Richard was making zillions making a clown of himself, Watt and Boon and Hurley were living like one should live, making excellent music that mattered instead of excellent music that was merely fun and catchy.  Whom do you respect more?  <BR>There is so much more to say about the Minutemen, but I'll leave it by saying that I feel I owe Boon, Watt, and Hurley a big thank you.  They taught me a lot.  And every time I play the record, I get reminded of the lessons, and I get to play a lot of air guitar at the same time.
B000000W5H|4.0|Some commentaries may feel that Its Only Rock N Roll is just a standard by the numbers release by the Rolling Stones.  However, in addition to the usual brand of in your face rock n roll, there are some nice experimental pieces like the funky Fingerprint File, the tender acoustic gem Till The Next Goodbye, and the stunning Time Waits For No One.<br /> Yes, Time Waits For No One is a definite album highlight with the super guitar soloing by Mick Taylor against the back drop of stunning keyboard work by Nicky Hopkins.  Its nice that Mick Jagger gave up some of the spotlight on this song to Mick Taylor as Mickie T certainly added a great deal to the Stones sound with his ellaborate solos.  Its a shame that he was not allowed to contribute more.<br />Anyway, If You Can't Rock Me and Aint To Proud To Beg are a super one two punch combination to the open the album.  Its Only Rock N Roll is a good tune if a bit overplayed.  Like the reggae touches on Luxury.  Dance Little Sister is a nice rocker if a little bit basic.  If You Really Want To Be My Friend does drag a little bit in spite of some nice organ touches and background vocals.  Short and Curlies is both amusing and crude with rollicking piano contributions by Ian Stewart.<br />Well there you have it.  I commented on every song.  A very good recording although not quite on the same level as Sticky Fingers, Exile, Beggars Banquet, etc.... But pick it up anyway as there are several tracks(Fingerprint File, If You Can't Rock Me, Time Waits For No One, Aint Too Proud To Beg) which need to be in the collection of any Rolling Stones fan.
B000066NW0|5.0|So glad I didn't let previous reviews sway my decision to buy this CD! I went looking for this CD after I heard \\"Complicated\\" on the radio and saw Avril perform at the MTV Video Music Awards. Has it been overplayed? Perhaps, but if I really like a song, I don't get tired of it just because it is played on the radio 10 times an hour. This is how I felt about \\"Complicated\\". I have the CD and I still can't get enough of it. My first thought was of Alanis Morissette, but Avril's clearly got a style of her own. I also like that she has written the songs and has not caved to studio pressures to conform to a certain style. Her voice alone makes this CD worth having. Favorites: \\"Complicated\\" (of course!), \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Anything But Ordinary\\"...though I like them all. Rock on, Avril!!!
6305508550|5.0|perhaps the most quotable, resonant, memorable movie of the last five years - for a specific group of people.  as someone who used to work at an initech, the movie works at every level for me.  brilliant and watchable over and over.  cannot wait for the next edition of this DVD to come out - this is the VERY rare movie i won't mind paying for on DVD twice.
0345363132|5.0|It helps that I happen to agree in general with Ms. Penman's opinion of Richard III's strengths and weaknesses and what he probably was and was not guilty of, but whether or not you do too, this saga of the reigns of the two Yorkist kings of England is probably the most gripping novel so far in her medieval historical fiction collection.<br />As it opens, Queen Margaret, paranoid due to her Lancastrian husband Henry V1's mental illness, has Richard, Duke of York and his eldest son Edmund assassinated simply because of York's popularity.  York's youngest son Richard watches in adoration as his now-eldest brother Edward then crushes her, becoming King of England himself.  But triumph turns to tragedy as Richard watches Edward mary the grasping Elizabeth Woodville, gets caught in the middle of Edward's battles to the death with their cousin Richard Neville as well as their own brother George, is left by Edward's early death to deal with the Woodvilles as Richard III and finally suffers the greatest of his many personal tragedies just as Henry Tudor, the last hope of the Lancastrian family, finally makes his move.<br />The characters are incredibly strongly drawn. My only complaints might be that, although a good romance is nice, Richard's relationship with his wife-cousin Anne, the second main character, is sometimes a bit too sugary for me; and his cousin Henry Stafford of Buckingham is so stereotypical (everything but a twirling mustache!) that it's hard to believe Richard was taken in by him even if he was so devoid of other adult male relatives that he was blinded by gratitude.  Edward, the third of the three main characters, is just right - with enough good points to make you understand Richard's devotion while still making it clear that he had alot to do with the subsequent disaster that befell his sons as well as Richard.<br />Speaking of said disaster, we will, of course, probably never know the answer to the all-important question of Richard's reign - whetheror not he murdered Edward's sons Edward V and Richard of York at only 12 and 10 years of age.  Penman's solution is quite interesting - it wasn't Richard, but her Edward V is an angry boy who barely knew Richard, was devoted to his Woodville relatives and would never forget either that Richard (however justified) executed his Woodville kin or his claim to the throne (which more historians are considering invalid as more start to believe that Edward IV had been precontracted before his marriage to Elizabeth) - leaving open the question of what Richard might have had to do a few years down the road whether he wanted to or not if someone else hadn't done it for him.<br />The children are, incidentally, as fully developed as the adult characters.  Ironically, it's George's son Edward (whose mind-numbing, drawn out fate after the events of the novel made what may have happened to his cousins seem merciful in comparison) who will haunt you afterwards rather than the famous Princes in the Tower. <br />The novel is also, refreshingly, not dominated by the question of the Princes' fates - much, much more happened in Richard's life, and it's the whole tapestry of Richard's short, sad history that makes it so wonderful.  Some of the most memorable subplots - like the almost unbearably tragic story of Richard's sweet-natured cousin John Neville whose suicide/death in battle saves him from having to chose between deserting his brother or possibly having a part in Edward or Richard's deaths - are long over before there's even a hint that Richard will eventually wear a crown.<br />After all, even Richard's fiercest critics have to grant him that to make a fair decision, one has to start the story from the begining.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I couldn't get anything out of this record until I just wanted to give it a chance again and listened to it by headphones. And: &quot;whoo!&quot;, the sound seems so much forceful and there are a lot of lot of details in all the tracks. Especially when you listen to &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot; (I couldn't take it for serious while listening to it over ther speakers..).
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I am not particularly a big fan of Hugh Grant's, but he was outstanding in this entertaining movie. The script and the cast were just terrific, as was the sound track.<br />Grant plays Will, the shallow, self-centered recipient of an inheritance that allows him to live a life of leisure without working. He is at his most charming when he is asked what he does and gets one of those \\"aw shucks\\" looks before admitting that he does....nothing. He resorts to going to a single-parents' meeting and inventing a son in order to meet a woman. In the meantime, he forms a reluctant friendship with Marcus, an odd young boy whose mother is raising him alone. This relationship with Marcus is the heart of the movie and is the basis for Will's coming of age..<br />Other reviewers have gone into the story-line of the movie more than adequately, so I don't need to do that again.<br />This is a fresh take on an old theme with characters you can like and a lot of laughs. How this all comes together is delightful, which is a credit to all who worked on this film. There is no preaching about the insignificance of Will's self-indulgent life....and Grant's portrayal of Will makes him very likeable despite his flaws.<br />I enjoyed this film for its entertainment value ....it made me laugh, which is just what I wanted.
0743216458|4.0|\\"Band of Brothers\\" is not good history; it's lacking in objectivity, it's highly anecdotal, it doesn't have any maps, and its scope is highly limited.  However, it is all of these factors that make it such a wonderful portrait of men in combat.  Ambrose wasn't setting out to write a history of the European Theater of Operations, he wasn't even trying to write a history of the 101st Airborne.  Rather, he was trying to capture something of the uncommon courage show by these otherwise common men in this face of astonishing trials.<br />Ambrose picks up the story of Easy Company as they work their way through training, and follows it all the way through to the end of the war.  In between, through an enormous volume of first hand interviews, he paints a harrowing picture of the men of Easy as they slog through Europe.  It's not always pretty; Ambrose doesn't pull any punches, particularly when it comes to inept leadership (and he names names), and he doesn't take any pains to hide the drinking and gambling.  The result, though, is an intimate view of men who have been thrust into extraordinary circumstances, and are just struggling to get by.<br />Because of the book's limited scope, Ambrose was able to capture the chaos of combat quite effectively.  The big picture is rarely elaborated upon, and the reader is presented with Easy Company, time and again, hanging on to survive, and then taking the fight to the enemy.  One can't help but feel that this approach more than adequately captures the sense of isolation that men in infantry combat must feel.<br />If you are looking for a comprehensive history of airborne operations in World War II this is not the book for you.  But if you are seeking a deeper understanding of why these men were able to face extraordinary odds and win, of what made them brothers in the truest sense of the word, then you would do well to pick up this book.  By turns funny and sad, unbearably tense and lighthearted, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is a remarkable look at what combat can do to men, and how they can make something good out of something awful.
B000002A46|5.0|Almost every pop and rock performer worth his salt feels an inexplicable obligation to make a Christmas album - everyone, from Elvis to New Kids On The Block (remember them?) made one.<br />Well, this is not your average &quot;modern carols&quot; album. For a start, it feels that Mariah was taking this project really seriously and not just going through the motions, but putting all her skill and effort into the 10 tracks that we have here. <br />Maybe this sheer, honest and pull-all-the-stops approach is one of reasons why the CD enjoys such a phenomenal success.<br />&quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; is such a strong and catchy and well executed tune that even now, eight years after its first release, it feels supercharged and full of energy - play it in your car, pump up the volume and feel that shiver of pleasure on your spine! This is on par with such giants of feelgood songwriting as ABBA or Smokie.<br />All tracks are very impressive, but I would specifically mention Hark! The Herald Angels Sing/Gloria, which is doing good justice to the cathedral-like majesty of this old song. Also, check out Joy to the World, revealing the capabilities of Mariah's great voice in a most beneficial way.<br />If you don't like Mariah Carey, then this album will not reform you: and this is fair enough, not everyone enjoys her singing. It may not also be an ideal choice for those who are disgusted by the very thought of cheery and oh-so-uplifting Christmas tunes. However, if you enjoy like the type, you will love this album, it will definitely be in the most-often-used part of your CD collection.
B00006F7S4|3.0|He's not that great a vocalist.  He's not that great a guitar player.  He's not even that great a songwriter.  But you know what?  Whether people like to admit it or not, neither was Dylan, or Young, or Cash, or Guthrie, or anyone else a certain section of the population considered a genius at some point in history.  No one that creates pop music is ever a genius.  It is simply too easy to make pop music.  Not that it's not at all difficult, but you get my meaning.  But I think this album is becoming a victim of high expectations.<br />Like most over-hyped albums from over-hyped artists, people seem to either love or hate it (as is pretty apparent in a lot of these reviews).  I can't really go to either extreme.  It is highly polished for a Beck album, but I don't think it's so produced that it takes away from any of the songs.  I think that if this album were &quot;grittier&quot; like some of his earlier works, many of his fans would like it better.  As Tom Waits (sp?) once said, &quot;most people try to isolate the music, I am slowly trying to integrate it.&quot;  I think Becks earlier works are examples of that, and that also may be why some people are receiving this album badly.<br />When it comes down to it, there are some very good songs on this album.  Sure the vocals are cliche (and don't tell me his cryptic vocals of the past are artistic metaphors.  &quot;Truck Drivin' Neighbors Downstairs&quot; is not some kind of artistic, allegorical statement.  Give me a break!).  Sure the whole album is slow, plodding, and occasionally boring.  It certainly isn't genius, but it's certainly worth a listen.  I'm sure this CD will come in very handy when I'm feeling depressed.
1570629706|5.0|This is the rarest of books--it's one of the very few you remember and reread and recommend and reread and recommend some more.  It makes life seem unknowable and breathtaking, which I guess is about as much as any book can do.  Thank god Hesse wrote Steppenwolfe soon after, since the beauty of Siddhartha is almost discouraging.  And if you've read Siddhartha (or Steppenwolf), you HAVE to read Journey to the East.  But first, READ SIDDHARTHA!!
B000063S6Z|1.0|Good God, why are so many people rating this album so high?!  Don't get me wrong, from what I've seen of Moby he seems like a very nice fellow, but that can't make up for the fact that this CD is terrible.<br />This entire recording sounds like it was created with a single keyboard and a vast pile of old records.  It's as if he raided an old record store in the village and said, &quot;ok, I have my album.&quot;  The drum lines are flat and boring, sounding like the worst drum tracks of the worst midi &quot;composers.&quot;  The music never goes anywhere, and is only sustained by the complete over-use of vocal samples.  It's like rap in reverse; make bland, uninteresting, near-video game-sounding music, and spice it up with vocal melodies WRITTEN BY OTHER PEOPLE.<br />With the right equipment, a 12-year-old with part of his brain stem removed could make an exact duplicate of this record.  Watch out, Moby!  Right now a teenager with MTV Music Maker is in his basement scheming to rob you of your &quot;eccentric genius&quot; status.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I've heard so much about this album this year.  I picked it up, having heard random Wilco songs from each of their albums.  It's definitely in a new direction, though not 180 degrees from their older stuff.  While a lot of people are saying this album is brilliant, I gave it four stars because I'm expecting even bigger and better things from Wilco in the future.  With Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, they've branched off into new territory, and are still getting their feet under them.  I'm looking forward to seeing them produce an album as original as YHF with all the assuredness of Summerteeth.  If you're ready for a new Wilco experience, pick this one up in the meantime, and give it the attention it deserves and requires.
0156012197|4.0|This book has such a positive reflection for today's youth as well as the average adult. This book allows children to use their imagination, while adults gain a deeper, more philosophical meaning. I would recommend this book to people from all ages, to entertain the child within.
6305949980|5.0|Halloween is one of my favorite holidays of the year so when I hear that there was a movie out that shows &quot;Jack&quot; the mayor of Haloween town taking over Christmastown from Santa a ran out and found the movie!<br />And I loved every minute of it.. Tim Burton has a very unique way of picturing movies.. he can combine the most horrific pictures and themes into the most pleasant film that you have ever watched.. And he carries on the traditional throughout this movie.<br />And the music is excellent (as it should be being from Elfman)..<br />I however do not recommend the movie for the under 10 crowd.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This movie is a terrific mix of state of the art special effects, action, and storyline that is a lot better that the box office receipts show.  It tells the story of a few high school sutdents who go into the army in order to become citizens of a facist society.  Soon they're fighting in a war against giant bugs and becoming loyal subjects of the government.  It's full of great perfomances by the actors and action sequences that are not for the squeamish.  The movie is has a great romantic triangle between Johnny, Carmen, and Dizzy and is intended as a satire of facist societies. <br />Casper van Dien and Dina Meyer stand out in lead roles and Michael Ironside delivers a great supporting performance.  Director Paul Verhoeven does a top notch job in mixing a sci-fi story with the satire and many reminders of World War II battles.  What really blew me away is the fact that the movie actually has a great screenplay instead of just having great special effects like so many other sci-fi movies.  Overall, the movie is as good as any of the original Star Wars movies.  <br />The special features include deleted scenes and a commentary by the director and three of the actors that adds a lot of insight into the plot and some great stories about the making of the film.
0790729628|4.0|Blade Runner was definitely a film before its time when it was released into theaters in 1982. Most folks wanted the glitzy special effects that films like the Star Wars trilogy had in abundance. They cared little for any amount of substance that caused you to think beyond the box of popcorn in front of you. Then came Blade Runner....Theatrically, it was a flop. The box office take was low. However, people weren't just ready for it yet. It proved a &quot;thinking&quot; person's film and to this day has become a standard of its genre. My only complaint is the unavailability of the original narrated version. I enjoy the directors cut but there DEFINITELY needs to be a box set with both the directors cut AND the original version. Despite the darker (and more potent) ending of the director's cut, the film noir style of Harrison Ford's narrative gave this film a totally unique feel for a science fiction movie. It is sorely missed!

0805017305|5.0|If you're looking for a narrative of the struggles between the various native tribes of North America and european settlers, there probably isn't a better place to go.<br />I read this book on my way to Wounded Knee this summer. There was so much I didn't know about the expansion of the United States (and much I still don't know, I'm sure) that my mouth gaped with horror throughout every chapter. The account of how the very laid back friendly tribes of California were mowed down by settlers without a second thought was particularly chilling. As the book itself says, no one remembers these tribes of California because they didn't put up a fight. They were simply swept aside.<br />Reading this book also filled gaps in the stories I had heard: Crazy Horse, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, The Trail of Tears, the Lakota Uprising, Little Big Horn and of course Wounded Knee. All of these and other stories you probably haven't heard before are put together in chronological order. It is a very comprehensive and readable book, but it does tell of an unreconcilable tragedy.<br />When I finished this book, one day before arriving at Wounded Knee, I was overcome with the feeling that europeans can never make up for what they did to the people who were here before them. What happened is forever unreconcilable. But self-flagellation and reproach will not undo anything, nor help either side as they currently stand. What most european descendants can do is read this book to know what happened, and then visit Wounded Knee to see where it all ended and observe. Only then will one be on the road to understanding, as inevitably incomplete as that understanding must be and remain.
B00006J3T4|4.0|I've read all your reviews and agree in some ways with all of you. I, too, miss the steel guitar format of Dire Straits that could compel me to run for the volume dial. I enjoy this compilation and Golden Heart and play them often simply to hear that extrordinary voice and those colorful phrases. Mark Knopfler is certainly one of the most talented artists of our time. But, face it folks, he's headed in a deeply country direction. I've never been a country fan, but I could see the movement even in Dire Straits' days. If you like country/bluegrass then go for this one and hear the magnificent one's voice. He tells stories like nobody else can.<BR>Mark, please, just one more Local Hero/Wild Theme.
B000065U1N|5.0|Best war movie to date! My only compliant is with the DVD. In UK and else were the DVD was released in a 2-Disk special edition, which is only in region two format, meaning you cannot watch it on American players. The special edition includes the following DVD Special Features:<br /><br />Disc One:<br />Features plus three Commentaries, including Director Ridley Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer<br />Filmmaker and cast biographies<br />Disc Two:<br />Eight Deleted/Alternative Scenes<br />Six Essence of Combat Featurettes<br />Seven Image and Design Featurettes including Jerry Bruckheimer's On Set Photography<br />I would really like to see this released in the states. I'm sure once they soak enough people into buying the single disk DVD they will release a \\"Special Edition\\".
B00006JL1Z|5.0|The classic lineup that was reconstructed in 1975 after guitarist Bob Welsh left the band, has recently released &quot;The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac.&quot; It is a 2-disc collection of not only their greatest hits, but classic songs that were never released, but very well known. Standouts include the 1976 studio version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, remixed versions of &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Over My Head&quot;, and many Top Ten hits like &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;, &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, and &quot;Sara.&quot; The first disc is Enhanced with bonus material including a documentary of the band, minus Christine McVie, recording their new album, due out early 2003. It has song lyrics, selected discographies, and links to the band members web sites. The most entertaining of the features is the &quot;vaults&quot;, which is only accessable through the internet. It includes the music video for &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, live performances from the Mirage Tour including &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; and &quot;The Chain.&quot; &quot;Don't Stop&quot; from the Dance Tour and a rare performance of &quot;Rhiannon&quot; from the 1976 Rosebud documentary, which is absolutely haunting. This 2-disc CD oustshines the 1988 release of their greatest hits and makes room for a more updated version of their classic songs to be showcased.
B000026258|4.0|Just heard this for the first time. If you're an artist of any kind, put it on while you're at work on something, i think it made my left brain more eccentric, but still controlled. If i lived in an apartment i would use it as a wake up album and keep it playing throughout the quarters as i got ready for my day, brushing teeth, getting dressed, eating breakfast, etc. this album has to put a faint, maybe unrecognizable smile on your face. really unique and and inspiring music.
B000002KGT|5.0|Fleetwood Mac achieved worldwide success in 1975 after Americans Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joind the band. With hits like \\"Over My Head\\" and \\"Rhiannon\\", the band reflected a dark, mystical persona that could not be ignored. By 1976, personal problems took their toll on the bandmates. John and Christine McVie divorced, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks ended their long-term relationship, and drummer Mick Fleetwood's wife left him and returned to England. Overall, the band hit an all-time low, crippled by mass quantities of drugs and alcohol. They hit the studio in mid-1976 to create a follow-up to their debut smash. What was to come would be something the band was not prepared for. Stevie Nicks contributed \\"Dreams\\", \\"I Don't Want To Know\\", and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" to the album, displaying her dark, yet powerful role within the band. Lindsey Buckingham displayed his envy towards Stevie for throwing him out of her life with the hard edge of \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and \\"Second Hand News.\\" Last but not least, Christine McVie revealed in her songwriting that she was ready to move on with her life with songs like \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" and \\"Don't Stop.\\" Together the band carefully put the pieces of their broken hearts together to create Rumours, an album that would quickly become one of the greatest-selling albums of all time, yield four Top Ten hits, earn a Grammy as well as two nominations, two American Music Awards, four Rolling Stone Awards, go platinum 17 times, and have a major influence on several artists that would achieve fame years later. After the album reached number one on the American charts in 1977, no other album would replace its position for the course of the year. While breaking hearts, they busted charts and became the most popular band of the 1970's. The legacy of the album has stood the test of time and is still a favorite among a new generation of music fans today.
B00005T30L|4.0|Buddies Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) graduate from high school and have no idea what to do with their futures, yet this is not your typical high school/slacker movie.<br />After playing around with the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; personal ads, they trick a middle-aged man Seymour (Steve Buscemi) into meeting 'his lovely blonde that you met on an airplane' at a local restaurant. Seeing his disappointment and sadness, Enid develops a friendship with Seymour. They both like music and Enid starts to abandon her future plans, and Rebecca, to spend time with this man. Ileana Douglas, as the pottery teacher Roberta, gives a hilarious supporting performance. <br />Very cynical and dark...at times even funny! One of the most underrated and best films of 2001! If you like &quot;Election&quot;, you'll love this!
0792151712|1.0|That Sinking Feeling<br />When you raise the dead from the depths of the ocean, you should show some respect. This movie insults the past with its anachronistic characters, especially DeCrapio who spits and brats his way through the movie and falls in love with that pug muffin Kate Winslet. All around good actors are dying and we're supposed to care what happens to these two amateurs. Let's try making movies for adults because the kids this is aimed at will grow up soon enough.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I liked Baz Luhrmann's previous works such as \\"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet\\" but \\"Moulin Rouge\\", in my opinion, was perfect, I'd give it ten stars if I could. It was a magnificent and breathtaking film. Kidman was born to be Satine and Ewan McGregor actually CAN sing. The film was a bit too dramatic at times and the cinematography was incredible...\\"Moulin Rouge\\" should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Baz Luhrmann should have had an Oscar nomination. <br />Some people criticized the cinematography for being too vibrant and colorful but that was the best feature of the movie. Normally, I do not care for musicals but this is more than 'just a musical'...it has elements of drama and comedy as well. Nicole Kidman was absolutely beautiful and she did a FANTASTIC job as Satine. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was a large [array] of colors, music and the craziest, most gaudy sounds of music ever! The costumes fit the movie very well. <br />The music was great too. It was cool to hear Nirvana, \\"Lady Marmalade\\", \\"Material Girl\\" and Marilyn Monroe's calling card all at once. I also liked Kylie Minogue as The Green Fairy/Tinkerbell. Bottom line: I love this film. <br />A+
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I truly dig Fleetwood Mac.they have made some truly tight Songs over the years.\\"Don't Stop\\" is a Classic that just gets better with time.\\"Landslide\\" is a Classic for me as well.Hold Me,Sara,Tusk, all are tight songs.this is a Solid Collection for New Fans&a Great Overview.
B00005OB0A|4.0|Yes, I admit it: I tried to resist, but here I am: I like Kylie! <BR>What of It? She's a guilty pleasure. Her latest outing, \\"Fever\\", is sugary, frothy, frilly pop.<BR>That said, there are a few things to consider; \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" may draw you in with it's super-catchy hook, but it's not the best song on the album. \\"Love At First Sight\\" is a joyous-sounding ditty with its disco strings, \\"Come Into My World\\" follows the same formula as \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" so it's equally infectious, but for my money, \\"Your Love\\" wins the prize! This song is the best, all shimmery and sun-drenched. <BR>On this UK Import, you also have a treat in two bonus tracks, \\"Boy\\" and \\"Butterfly\\". These tracks are as good as the regular album tracks. \\"Butterfly\\" comes off Minogue's last album, Light Years, and is a clubber's dream. <BR>Note:If you just gotta have a mega-dose of Minogue, I highly recommend looking for her singles, released in two parts, complete with stylish, sexy photos, enhanced video, remixes, and best of all, bonus tracks. Honestly, some of these bonus tracks are better than the stuff that actually got on the album! \\"Good Like That\\" (from \\"In Your Eyes\\") and \\"Baby\\" (from \\"Love At First Sight\\") are just as catchy anything, and well worth hunting for. Like lollipops, you'll want every flavor!<BR>So don't fight it, load this CD in your car and sing along on Saturday night!
B00005YW4H|5.0|My husband bought me the Norah Jones CD as a departure from my &quot;old&quot; favorites, James Taylor, Carole King and the like.  I found her to be very refreshing, with a voice like velvet.  You can easily fall into the gentle rhythm of this CD and flow with the great tunes.  Her bass-y version of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; is amazing!<br />If you like a good mellow jazz-y CD, this one is great!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne may not be the most original &quot;new kid on the block&quot;, but even if she sounds like alanis, shes great! Has anyone thought that writing for yourself, and not the media, is probably the best music you're gonna get? Avril is merely emulating her peers. Not everybody has to develop a totally new style of music to be a wonderful singer and songwriter. In fact, I'm listening to &quot;too much to ask&quot;, and it states that &quot;you cant see the world through a mirror&quot;. Thats probably the most inteligent thing ive heard since Pink's &quot;he taught me about peace and all the great things we take advantage of&quot;<BR>If you say that Avril is lacking in newness, i think you're wrong. Just think of her as a continuation of Alanis' legacy.
B00004X01U|3.0|This is an okay cd with some good tracks but if you don't feel spending 15$ download off the net.
B000002LQR|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums the chilis have ever written. With one of thier best singles on the album, Under the Bridge, written by antony kiedis, this is the story of how he got over his herroin addiction. For they backing at the end of the track, John Fruciate's mothers chior sang, which gives the song a cool ending. Also, Breaking the girl, a song about a broken relationship. For this particular song they filled the haunted hollywood mansion which they recorded blood sugar sex magik with steel and tin metal. They released the album in 1991, and it made a big impression on mtv with the song 'give it away', which was about a old girl friend of antony kiedis, who gave away her black leather jacket to him. From there, the red hot chili peppers made it big, with flea on the bass, jon fruciate on guitar, chad smith on drums, and antony kiedis on lyrics. Truley one of the best chili albums ever made.
B00005QK3W|4.0|I typically judge a McCartney album by counting how many times I cringe while thinking to myself, &quot;What the hell ever happened to the guy who wrote all those great songs on REVOLVER, RUBBER SOUL, and ABBEY ROAD (to name just three)?&quot; I have to admit that I cringed only once while listening to this album.....er, well, many times really but only one song was to blame...&quot;Loving Flame&quot;. Basically, I love the sound, although it could use a little (and only a little) more polish. There's definitely a ton of energy here, and the songs are generally strong (mayber even stronger than on FLAMING PIE). Can't wait to hear where Paul may takes this in the future.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Wow!! I love this cd!!! Most of the time I listen to him at home but when I can, I'll bring his cd to work and pop it in the player.I love the songs and everything. He is so sexy!( I just recently bought his new cd Quizos and although I don't speak or really know Spanish, I think his songs are romantic,well, they sound romantic to me). My favorite songs are Escape, Luv 4 fun, and One night stand. If I could, I'd give the cd more stars!
B00006J9OT|2.0|Diane Krall cannot SING!!! I was at a party and they were playing this CD it is relatively new and it was played like it was the only cd they had. The musicality and artistry that is portrayed through her piano is extraordinary...then unfortunately, she opens her mouth, which sounds watered <BR>down, gargled like a saxophone with duct tape over the bell opening. \\"Just the way you are\\" is a studio version done on the cd with Michael Brecker and Christian McBride, incredible musically, but then luckily we all know the words because the lyrics by Krall don't break thru the gargling....
B00002DE0S|3.0|This CD contains 2 concerti by Frederick Chopin.<br />Zimerman did a nice try in this CD with many rubatos of piano and orchestra which is very nice.<br />However, Zimerman's solo performance here is rather disappointing. His tone colour seldom changes and almost played the whole piece with one atmosphere. The Orchestra did helped a lot with this. The passionate performance of young age has passed. Chopin composed these two concerti when he was rather young, full of teenager's imagination. Zimerman did rather more mature but can't achieve a higher state.<br />Overall, the sound quality is ok and the performance is worth a listen for the integration of orchestra and solo which is quite difficult to achieve.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|\\"Beauty and the Beast is Disney's greatest film.  It gets to the heart of human essence.  We need to see past the outside and see other people's insides.  C. S. Lewis wrote a novel called \\"Till We Have Faces.\\"  When we see other people's faces, we begin to love them.  The key is seeing past the beast and seeing the image of God engraven on other's countenances.  That is the pure love of Christ!<br />This film has everything that you want in a tale: a good heroine, an antagonist that becomes the protagonist, hilarious buffoons, and a villain you can really hate.  This movie outstrips \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" and I hope it lasts forever.
B00006FDCD|3.0|Alright, look, I was only gonna give this two stars, but since there aren't that many made-for-television movies that are even HALF as good as this, I decided to bump my rating up to three stars.  The premise of the movie and some of the first half is pretty genuinely frightening, 'specially if you have quite an imagination like I do, and Tim Curry REALLY takes on the role of Pennywise well.  In fact, if you watch this movie for anything at all, watch it for Curry as the deranged killer clown, as it is, hands-down, the most memorable performance in the movie.  But, other than that, the most entertaining aspect is director Tommy Lee Wallace's stylish camerawork, and jus' watching the story unfold, as each of the character's begin to lose their grip on reality.  I mean I'm not a fan of Stephen King's novels or movies at all (aside from 'The Shining', the movie, NOT the book, course that was more Kubrick than King), but he really laid down a pretty original and chilling tale here, that will really play on your psyche.  But it's ruined by too much melodramatic dialogue, cheesy, unconvincing love stories, and all around hammy acting from the main players.  The only really decent performance I saw of the seven friends was Harry Anderson, whose sarcasm and dry wit was DESPERATELY needed to give some spark to the lifeless and emotionless dialogue.  Go 'head an' rent this one if you feel the urge, but, personally, I'd leave it at that.  Is' jus' not somethin' I'd watch over and over again.
0385015364|5.0|After reading the first paragraph, I thought, \\"I wish I had written this book.\\"<br />Chesterton has the gift of thought and the gift of expression, a rare commodity in the age of chatter and blather.  I found myself puffing to keep up with his logic!<br />I think the power of the book is found in the subtitle: romance and faith.  Americans see God through the squint of Puritanism, so we see Him as merely a syllogism or a cosmic party pooper.  We forget that our God was once accused of being a glutton and wine-bibber.  I could see many alleged Christians doing likewise if He were here today.  Chesterton breaths the life back into Adam's clay, and for this I thank him!
1559409010|4.0|It's funny but unfortunately you have to be in the mood for watching dark mental slapstick.  Irreverence without offense.  Although not reccommended for puritans.  Rent it, definitely, if you are a Monty Python fan, buy it.<br />Enjoy
0345349571|3.0|Original evocation of the 14th century in Europe through the life of one person, the French nobleman de Coucy.<BR>This book certainly gives a good picture of this century: war, plagues, gangs of robbers, a corrupt Church, witch-hunt, devaluations ... but it is too long and contains too many detailed descriptions of battles.<BR>For me, it remains too superficial compared to the magisterial work of Jean Delumeau 'Sin and Fear: the Emergence of the Western Guilt Culture 13th-18th Centuries', or 'The Waning of the Middle Ages' by Johan Huizinga. This latter work illustrates admirably the mentality change: e.g. cities bought condemned persons in order to organize their public executions as a big show for their inhabitants.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple Maggart, a skinny, sad teen stomped upon the ground in 1996 with her debut entitled \\"Tidal\\". An attractive girl with beautiful wide eyes(both sad yet childlike at the same time) that never smiled, Fiona was an original. A small girl with scornful, soulful pipes with as much conviction as Ella Fritgerald and even Billie Holliday. Arriving in a music scene(1996) that was coping with the demise of grunge and gearing up for teen-pop and more pop-aimed rap(after the death of Tupac Shakur), Fiona didn't fit in with the commerical landscape. Never a \\"Lilth Fair\\" scenster, Fiona beat to her own drum. Sad, confused, angry, and loopy, Fiona sang with a soul WAAAYYYY beyond her then-18 years. A victim of rape and emotional abuse, this teen's angst was like no other. <br />\\"Tidal\\" is mindblowing. Dark, murky, and soulful. You fill different after you listen to it. As a songwriter, her songs are blunt, emotional, pensive, and self absorbed yet strangely revelant. This is a woman who knows she's screwed up but unlike Alanis Morrisette she isn't going to ground herself in her pretenions. She's world weary... Opening with \\"Sleep To Dream\\", a stalking theme of romantic collaspe with biting lyrics and thundering piano taps. \\"Sullen Girl\\" is powerful as Fiona poetically reancts her rape. In fact this whole album is just powerful...for lack of a better word. \\"Slow Like Honey\\", \\"Never Is A Promise\\", the murky \\"Shadowboxer\\", \\"Criminal\\", \\"Carrion\\"...it's very hard to believe that a 17 year old girl wrote this. But she did. Her soulful vocals ache with disappointment, regret, and pain. Amazing...<br />\\"Tidal\\" is one of the best albums of the 1990s and one of the best debuts ever. Fiona's somphmore release \\"When The Pawn...\\" was more mature and poised. And even topped \\"Tidal\\" as it was more three-dimensional. Although Fiona's indoscryatcies and unapolegtic stance has scared off many, her gift can't be denied. This is deeply emotional stuff right here. And in that, Ms. Apple hasno peers.
B00006JIAF|4.0|...I don't really understand what all the hype is over this band.  I've been reading things like these guys are the \\"saviors of rock music\\" and the such, which I completely don't buy into.  I wasn't really all that impressed with \\"last nite\\", but I dug \\"hard to explain\\" quite a bit and I really dug \\"someday\\", it just sticks in your head better than some of the other tracks, and it's the main reason I finally broke down and decided to buy the album, plus the video is their best so far in my opinion, featuring another excellent lo-fi band that I love, Guided by Voices, but all of the songs are good, none of them what I would consider \\"filler\\" material.  All the videos they've released so far are included on the dvd, plus two tracks recorded on Mtv including \\"NYC cops\\", which is a great song.  There is a definite Velvet Underground influence present, but I've heard some people also mention a likeness to the Stooges, which I really disagree with because the Stooges(a band I dearly love) were just much more raw, chaotic, violent, and in-your-face to the point where a similarity between them and the Strokes is just inappropriate.  But don't take that the wrong way, I genuinely love the Strokes, and \\"Is This It\\" is an album that has grown on me, they've just got that retro vibe about them that is sorta refreshing considering the current state of rock music with all this \\"nu-metal\\" [stuff] and the like muddying up the airwaves(not that I've ever been a big fan of commercial radio).  It just seems that a lot of the current crop of bands (at least major label ones) are a disgrace to the genres of punk and metal or alternative or rock in general, and the Strokes have gone back to a sound and a \\"vibe\\" that harkens back to the days when music really meant something, rather than just being a commercialized pawn in the money-making machine(which, with all the media hype surrounding them up through now, I'm afraid they've been thrown in that mix as well) but regardless, it's nice to hear a band take music forward a bit simply by being retro-minded and going back to a sound that reminds us of the simple beauty in rock 'n' roll.  All in all, I think these guys are worthy of the praise they've been getting, and with the bonus (limited edition, I might add)dvd(how limited? who knows?), you have a great deal on some excellent music and video footage that I just can't help but to recommend.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I love this CD.  I'll be honest-I didn't particularly care for the movie.  After seeing it, however, I thought the soundtrack would be pretty good so I decided to buy first of the two CDs that came out for it.  I was not disappointed.  All my favorite songs from the movie are in it, as well as some extras I don't remember hearing.  My favorite of those is easily Beck's &quot;Diamond Dogs,&quot; which is one of my favorite songs on the entire disk.  There is honestly not one song that I will skip over.  Hope you all enjoy it as much as I have!
B00005JKDR|1.0|Disney is known for putting out bad movies, but this is hands down the worst movie ever released by Disney.  The monsters didn't scare me at all and everything was so unrealistic.  I thought monsters were scary?  Instead of achieving the horror of a good monster movie we receive the buffonery of some teen fad movie.
B00006G8HX|2.0|Star Trek III is definitely one of my favorite of the films. Thus, why the director's edition earned at least 2 stars with me. <BR>Why DIDN'T it earn a good 4 or 5 stars? Simple. I felt ripped off slightly because I expected Paramount and Mr. Nimoy to give us something other than the same old thing. I felt almost the same way about Star Trek: TMP Director's Edition. It, however, had more content than this. I went and shelled another (...) to Paramount to witness these things??? :<BR>NO improvement in the sound<BR>NO deleted scenes<BR>NO Special Effects enhancement or sound enhancements<BR>Add to that same old movie I ALREADY OWNED on DVD and give me a couple of ridiculously unsatisfying features including a commentary which lasted about 25 minutes, and you have the gist of my disappointment. I could have done without the small \\"making of\\" segment, which was extremely inadequate, and the other window dressing segments that accompanied it. \\"How to speak Klingon.\\" PUHHH LEASE!!! Does Paramount think that all Star Trek fans are children?? <BR>The Disappointment and the let down really drove this possible 4 or 5 down to a 2. Wake up, Paramount. Give us MORE for the hard earned money we shell out to you!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This new widescreen version on DVD is fantastic. Video and audio quality are top notch. If anyone ever needed an excuse to buy a widescreen TV and surround system...this is it. On my Pioneer 64 inch HDTV and DTS sound setup...it is better than the theater. I enjoyed this movie like it was the first time again. Besides the obvious great story here..I always felt the key to this movie was the John Williams soundtrack. Certainly his finest work, and maybe the best film score of all time. The last 10 minutes of the movie may rank as the best of film and music together.

B000002NIW|5.0|Well, I was very proud to call myself a resident of Sacramento after hearing this CD.  By far their best, it was the clean yet aggressive CD that fits between the garage-hardcore \\"Adrenaline\\" and experimental \\"White Pony\\", and was the album that put the Deftones into Bucky's Official Top Ten Bands of All Time.<BR>Every song on this CD rocks.  I sometimes tend to skip track 3 (which slows the CD down a bit) and does get kind of annoying to have to skip ahead to 32 minutes on the final track to hear the hidden song \\"Damone\\", but I don't know of any other CD that consistently keeps my head moving like this one.  \\"My Own Summer\\" has one of my favorite guitar riffs of all time, and I have to play \\"Dai the Flu\\" at least twice every time I listen to the CD.  Strange how the Deftones could remain on the back burner of the rap-metal craze when they have such fantastic albums as this and ... Limp Bizket was so much more popular.  Oh well, let the masses be fed their nonsense....
B00005QDW1|1.0|This is without a doubt (no pun intended) the most immature and pedestrian CD I've ever heard. The songs have unintelligent lyrics and don't really say much about anything. You don't even need to listen to the CD to tell this, just look at the song titles. \\"Making Out\\"? \\"Platinum Blond Life\\"? I mean, come on! Music is supposed to be an expression that makes you think. These songs are fit for a seventh grade dance. Real rock fans will know that \\"Rock Steady\\" is a (...) imitation that is trying to appeal to a pop and rock audience. Don't waste your money on this one.
B000001E7V|3.0|Tricky(nee Adrian Hawes), former member of Massive Attack, released one of the most critically lauded albums of the 1990s with with his 1995 debut \\"Maxinquaye\\". Called everything from one of the best debuts ever to one of the most influential albums of the 1990s, \\"Maxinquaye\\"(named after his mother Maxine Quaye who committed suicide when Tricky was four) was even said to be the 1990s' answer to \\"There's A Riot Goin' On\\". A supposed unique blend of postpunk angst, hip hop stunts, soulful vocals, art-rock eccentrities, and rock edge. An album that like Massive Attack's \\"Blue Lines\\" and Portishead's \\"Dummy\\" set the way for Bristol-helmed \\"trip hop\\". Well after a good and hard listen to \\"Maxinquaye\\", a conclusion has been made. <br />\\"Maxinquaye\\" defintely was OVERRATED. Unlike \\"Blue Lines\\" and \\"Dummy\\", it doesn't have the knowningness and accomplished pretenions. Lots of angst and ambition but more so in ideas rather than clear innovation. \\"Maxinquaye\\" is based in reggae/ hip hop-inspired dubbiness, slowed down beats, the crisp vocals of Martina Topley-Bird(the mother of Tricky's son), and heavy reverbation in the production. There's some filler on this album as well as so-so tracks. \\"Overcome\\", featured in a national teen-safe sex television commerical campaign is a reworking of Massive Attack's \\"Karmacoma\\" that makes up in sophistication what it loses in ambience in the original. <BR>(\\"Aftermath\\" was also heard in many television specials and films)<BR>Also, \\"Hell Round The Corner\\" features the same Issac Hayes sample used in the Portishead classic \\"Glory Box\\" a year earlier! <br />\\"Maxinquaye\\" has some shining moments though. The cover of Public Enemy's \\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\" is off the hook. With it's swirling metal guitars, Topley-Bird's awkard yet compelling reciting of Chuck D's lyrics, and reggae inspired percussion, the song does what innovators should do: adopt something from the past, mix different influences, and add their own stamp. The soulful\\"Pumpkin\\" is sparse and chilling. The modern day blues that \\"Dummy\\" mastered. \\"Strugglin'\\" is distant and crawling yet turns out to be one of the most intriguing tracks on \\"Maxinquaye\\" as Tricky laments on day to day survival. <br />If you're looking for a mindblowing album full of invention and intrigue, \\"Maxinquaye\\" just may not do. For a nice little trip hop record, it's a good listen. \\"Blue Lines\\" and \\"Dummy\\" are the two opuses that TRULY created and influenced. Tricky should be given his respect as an artist(especially a Black one) who does his own type of music but to call this a classic would be an untruth. And \\"Maxinquaye\\" could have been so much more. It could have been an offbeat, moody, apoloslytical journey of the struggles and hardships of a slightly crazed genius. Like a musical Jean Michel Basquiat painting. <br /> Not bad but awfully overrated.
0060194995|5.0|The first time I read this I was around eleven and this was required reading.I really did love the book when I finished it, although I prefer to read for fun rather than required reading.But anyways,  I am 21 years old now and after reading tons of books,which were great but had no substance at all.I would have to say that this book is a masterpiece.If you are brainless and want books to entertain you rather than teach you something.Or if you like Vin Diesel movies and watch trl, this is probably not the book  for you.
0790736241|5.0|This movie should not even be called a movie.  It is an experience that is transcendant.  It will make you feel.  It will make you feel vast and open, like the utopian blue ocean.  It is sublimely beautiful and visually extraordinary.  It is not of this world.  It is a message.  In fact there are several.  But the biggest one is that there is a God.  Because that's who made it.  I believe a movie can be such a thing as art, becuase this is it.  Keep an open mind; it is simply too special to be appreciated by everyone.  It's love.
B000002NIW|5.0|Well, I was very proud to call myself a resident of Sacramento after hearing this CD.  By far their best, \\"Around the Fur\\" is the clean yet aggressive CD that fits between the garage-hardcore \\"Adrenaline\\" and experimental \\"White Pony\\", and was the album that put the Deftones into Bucky's Official Top Ten Bands of All Time.<BR>Every song on this CD rocks.  I sometimes tend to skip track 3 (which slows the CD down a bit) and it does get kind of annoying to have to skip ahead to 32 minutes on the final track to hear the hidden song \\"Damone\\", but I don't know of any other CD that consistently keeps my head moving like this one.  \\"My Own Summer\\" has one of my favorite guitar riffs of all time, and I have to play \\"Dai the Flu\\" at least twice every time I listen to the CD.  Strange how the Deftones could remain on the back burner of the rap-metal craze when they have such fantastic albums as this and crap like Limp Bizket was so much more popular.  Oh well, let the masses be fed their nonsense....

B0000028MA|5.0|I was only 6 or 7 during the whole grunge era, and now I'm 17 and in the Britney Spears generation, so I've always felt kind of cheated. This soundtrack only adds to my jealousy of those who were teens in 1992. It's an excellent retrospective of alternative music, mostly artists from Seattle. It starts off with \\"Would?\\" one of the greates songs known to man, by the brilliant Alice In Chains. Layne's vocals are passionate and haunting... RIP.<BR><BR>Pearl Jam has two amazing songs to offer on this soundtrack as well, the rocking \\"Breath,\\" and the manic \\"State of Love and Trust.\\" This album also contains a relic of the Seattle scene. Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard's previous band Mother Love Bone has a song on here \\"Chloe Dance/Crown of Thorns\\" an 8 minute highly emotional song, kind of like Queen meets REM meets Soundgarden. MLB broke up in 1990 when vocalist Andy Wood overdosed, probably grunge's first casaulty, making the song about 100 times more emotional. <BR><br />Soundgarden makes a few appearances here, one as a group (in the adrenaline-pumping \\"Birth Ritual\\"), a very eerie Chris Cornell solo song \\"Seasons\\" and a collaboration with Ann and Nancy from Heart (known as the Lovemongers) on a cover of Zeppelin's classic ode to JRR Tolkien, \\"The Battle of Evermore,\\" which is very decent, with Nancy Wilson's backing vocals totally blowing out Sandy Denny's (a member of some late 60s-70s folk group) in the Zeppelin version. <BR><BR>Despite the fact that there is no Nirvana, it is still excellent. Mudhoney and Screaming Trees, two lesser known Seattle bands, offer some amazing songs here as well. Jimi Hendrix's \\"May This Be Love\\" gives a glimpse into Seattle's past legacy in music (Hendrix himself was born and raised in Seattle). <BR><BR>Paul Westerberg, formerly of the seminal Minneapolis alternative band the Replacements, has two songs here. \\"Dyslexic Heart\\" is the most catchiest song I have ever heard in my life. <BR><BR>The closing to this soundtrack is from Chicago's the Smashing Pumpkins, heavily affiliated with a few Seattle bands. They close the album off with \\"Drown,\\" an 8 minute song that ranks as one of their best songs. The song itself is about 4 minutes, then the ending consists of feedback and crazy guitar sound effects.<BR><BR>If you want a great soundtrack, and more proof that the early 90s had a lot to offer musically, pick this baby up, and crank it. The music is bound to affect you.
0440219078|5.0|\\"The Giver\\" is one of the most interesting and remarkable books I've ever read. The story causes you to think about the meaning of human emotions, life, and society. <br />To add to the mesmerizing atmosphere, the situations, plot, and characters are very well developed and attract your attention.<BR>The situations are carefully planned and the plot is descriptive, imaginative, and vivid. The characters are unique and have distinct personalities that different people can relate to. <br />It's a exceptionally challenging read, in terms of the way it is written and the vocabulary that is used.

B00005QJDG|4.0|Dream Theater is one of the most under-recognized groups in modern music. The group contains four of the best musicians on the planet. Mike Portnoy is an amazing drummer, and Myung and Rudess are both exceptional as well. And of course there's John Petrucci. He's one of my favorite guitarists because he has the technical proficiency of Joe Satriani or Steve Vai, but he manages to play with so much heart and emotion. The album starts with the band palying their epic album, Scenes From A Memory, in its entirety. They follow it up with some of their best songs. they even play Acid Rain, whcih was first played with Mike Portnoy's side project, Liquid Tension Experiment. All in all, this is an excellent display of how awsome these musicians truly are.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck, the man who had 'two turntables and a microphone,' now has a broken heart and a lot of emotional songs. This album is beautiful and very profound, and presents Beck, one of the most mercurial musicians of the last decade, in a whole new light, almost like drum programming meets Leonard Cohen. Certainly the best album released this year.
0792165020|4.0|The movie is `beautifully' ambiguous. It is beautiful, not in any metaphorical sense, but it actually looks `good', on the surface. Everything; right from the manner in which the starting credits are shown (especially the way the movie title is presented) to stunning camera angles, from some great vantage points. The movie is set somewhere in the midst of the late 50's; so every detail has been catered to, in order to create an aura of `those old days'. Most of the settings of the movie is based in Italy, and the visuals of the place is the stuff of heavens: the claustrophobic `tiled' roads, the `out -of -date' and `uncared for' vehicles, the enchantingly blue ocean, the `dreamy' houses with grand dcor, even the corpulent `ice - box', et al. It is the most aesthetically pleasing movie I have ever seen, or maybe I have been missing out on good - looking movies. This is as far as one of the aspects of the movie goes, and is a good reason to watch the flick.<BR>A better reason to view this motion picture, goes as follows:<BR>There is much more to this movie than meets the eye. The plot revolves around the trials and tribulations of a young, small - time con - man, Tom Ripley, who ventures into an unusual business of convincing a very rich and spoilt brat (`Dickie Greenleaf') of this humongous business magnate (`Herbert Greenleaf') to return to his father and stop being a worthless ... The movie actually begins when Ripley goes to Italy to confront Dickie, as entrusted by Herbert Greenleaf, lured by the promise of a reward of a thousand dollars; then, a lot of things begin to happen, which make up the movie. <BR>The picture, basically, throws a light on the various facets of Ripley's persona. Ripley is presented as this very normal, lonely person. He is, however, quite talented. He plays the piano well, and has the unique ability to impersonate people, feign people's hand - writing, signature, etc.; and he uses these qualities to make a living. Lonely, insecure and lovelorn Mr. Ripley instantly finds a liking towards Dickie Greenleaf, when Greenleaf shows a brotherly affection towards him. ... Sexually confused, yet calm, Mr. Ripley also finds affinity towards other people: Marge Sherwood, Meredith Logue, and Peter Smith-Kingsley. Muffled, he is; also he is sensitive... A moving scene at the opera succeeds in Ripley, jerking a couple of teardrops..  Also, ...the last scene of the movie, shot brilliantly, with multiple images of Ripley crying, from aptly angled mirrors, which leaves the conclusion of the movie, upto the viewer, to decide. Ripley doesn't like who he is. He uses his feigning qualities in impersonating the rich kid, Dickie, himself, which he quite well succeeds in doing so. All in all, director Anthony Minghella has done a fantastic job in successfully portraying the less pleasing human sides, by using Matt Damon as a guinea -pig. Matt, too does an impressive job in displaying the lesser characteristics of human emotions, quite effectively.  <BR>The movie has a dark undercurrent and is, at times, also frightening: all this, in a very subtle sense. There is hardly any [bad] `orchestral' music at critical moments, telling the viewers, when to feel any kind of emotion, appropriate for the situation. The feel is quite stolid, adding an eerie effect to the movie. In fact, the movie has a lot of fantastic jazz music, all throughout its duration and adds its own charm to the feel of the movie. <BR>An intelligent movie, if you don't prefer a `depressing' flick, watch it for the wonderful music and the masterful cinematography and choice of locations, and eventually, you will end up liking even the `depression' of it.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I recommend this c.d. to anyone, even if you don't like Christina Aguilera. It really explores her vocal range. I think the three most memorable and special tracks ar \\"Christmas Time\\", \\"This Year\\", and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\". I listen to this c.d all of time, even in July! It really has a happy and joyful tone and spirit to it. I think it is well worth your money!
B000003S09|5.0|Of course the opening track on this CD (21st Century Schizoid Man) is the most popular song on the album. It is one of the most amazing recordings, especially considering that it came out in 1969. These guys were using various distortion techniques and some truly insane instrumental work that was unlike anything else at the time. If the band never recorded another song, they probably would still be remembered for that revolutionary track. Even so, the album contains four other interesting songs that are all interesting as well. &quot;I Talk To The Wind&quot; is a lovely ballad that is completely unlike the other tracks on the album. I also like the title track that closes the album. As most critics have pointed out, the only shortcoming is when the band slips into some utterly aimless instrumental work in &quot;Moonchild&quot;. It doesn't sound that good and it goes on way too long. Still, that isn't a reason to disregard this amazing piece of early progressive rock.
0140434135|4.0|&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...<br />Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.<br />While not as charming as Austin's other books, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.<br />By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread.
B000002LHX|5.0|Danny Elfman may have done the score, but it's the music composed by Prince that makes this film unique in the annals of filmdom. Who can forget Jack Nicholson's Joker destructively cavorting through the museum to the strains of \\"Party Man\\"? Or can one not envision \\"Vicki Vale\\" looking seductively at \\"Bruce Wayne\\" without hearing \\"Scandalous\\" resonating in the background? Or is it possible to picture the Gotham City celebratory parade as Joker and company emerge atop a menacing float without recalling the dynamic \\"Trust\\"?<br />I don't think so!<br />The \\"marriage\\" of Burton, Keaton, Nicholson, AND PRINCE took \\"Batman\\" to a totally different level from the typical \\"superhero saga\\".
B00006G8HX|5.0|Describing this movie is pointless - every Star Trek fan in existence has seen it countless times.  The reason to buy the 2-disc DVD are the Special Features that are located on it.  \\"Captain's Log\\" has recent interviews with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Christopher Lloyd, and Robin Curtis.  It also offers a look back on the film from it's inception to the premiere.  \\"Star Trek Universe\\" has interviews with the designers and model makers of the space dock and Bird of Prey that are seen in the film.  It has Marc Okrand (a linguist) talking about how he created the Klingon and Vulcan languages.  \\"Terraforming and The Prime Directive\\" features NASA scientist Dr. Louis Friedman discussing the Genesis device and the Genesis planet and how we are now in the infant stage of the real thing as plans for making Mars habitable are underway.  \\"Archives\\" has many photos taken during filming of the movie, and the storyboards.  There are other features on this DVD such as commentaries, the creation of Klingon and Vulcan costumes and jewelry and the theatrical trailer.<br />I love this movie and never get tired of watching it.  My two favorite scenes both involve Enterprise; first when the ship is coming into space dock showing her battle scars and second when Enterprise is destroyed.  Sometimes I think Enterprise is the real star of this movie.  I already had Search For Spock but when the 2-disc DVD came out, I simply had to have it.  It is a must have for the Star Trek fan!  The interviews with the stars are very enlightening and entertaining and the \\"look back\\" is very interesting; I learned many things I didn't know.  The designers and model makers talking about special effects and how everything was made is wonderful, and although I can't speak Klingon or Vulcan, Marc Okrand discussing the languages had me in awe.  (How can anyone CREATE a language?)  Dr. Friedman discussing the greenhouse effect NASA will be creating on Mars and comparing it to the Genesis planet was veryeducational.<br />If you are a true Star Trek fan, you will buy this DVD!  It is a must have!  As Spock would say, \\"Fascinating.\\"
B00005K9LN|4.0|and the resulkts are mostly good. New drummer Dave Holland is no Les Binks to be sure, but at this point he could lay down some competent beats. The writing triverite of Halford, KK, and Glen is firmly established on Steel. The music itself is pretty good, though the road to lyrical self-parody(as well as instrumental greatness-which is apparent on almost all Priest albums). The excellent Metal Gods, The Rage, Steeler,United, and Breaking the Law(although the latter can get very annoying after too many listens) are mixed in with the average Rapid Fire(nice drums though), YDHTBOTBW, and Living After Midnight. The worst song to be found here would be the rather silly Grinder. As for the bonus tranks, Red White&amp; Blue is a somewhat silly anthem, but still comes off as a pretty good song. The live version of Grinder is acceptable, though it may be noted that it was NOT recorded on the British STell tour like the packaging says(note the &quot;Long Beach, California&quot; line from Rob is the same as the one at the end of Jawbreaker on Sin After Sin).<br />This album is not the best by Judas Priest, its more of an 'average' album. However, its also the definitive album due to the fact that the band's most enduring songs(Breaking the Law, Living After Midnight) can be found here. If you're new to the band this should probably be your second album, after &quot;Unleashed...&quot;
B000002KHF|5.0|After casting off the title of &quot;Pop Singer&quot; forever with 1968's  &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, Van Morrison turned in another fine set of top notch songs that, while not as startling and revolutionary as &quot;...Weeks&quot;, is nontheless a fantastic listen. This set of soul and jazz inflected recordings is highlighted by the signature title tune, the LP opening country flavored &quot;And It Stoned Me&quot; and the silken balladry of &quot;Crazy Love&quot; (later butchered by a whining Brian McNight!). This LP runs fairly quickly and further delves into the sounds and textures of His Irish heritage and sets the tone for most of his later work, ie; Morrison would return to this sound and these songs numerous times over the next 30 years. At this point in his esteemed career, Van The Man could do no wrong and listening to &quot;Moondance&quot; it's easy to see why the public loved him so even way back when.....
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-Man ranks up there with X-Men, Blade 2, Batman,and Batman forever as one of the Greatest Comic Book Movies of all time. Maguire is perfectly cast as the legendary webslinger, and suprisingly, so is Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane. Willem Dafoe makes a great villain performance as Spidey Villain Classic: The Green Goblin. Effects are good. Action is Spectacular. And Spider-Man is amazing.
0790729628|4.0|The definitive version of Ridley Scott's sci fi classic ditches the voice-over narration and sappy ending, and it all culminates in a more satisfying watch. Released in 1982, BLADE RUNNER sunk at the box office, and who knows what to attribute it's commercial failure to, perhaps it was the material that's now been taken out? Regardless, it's a deserved sci fi classic that has stood the test of time to become one of the greats. From the huge sucess of ALIEN, Scott's third film as director is perhaps not as clever as it tries to be, but it is nontheless entertaining Film Noir with some terrific action set-pieces and Special Effects. Hugely influential on films like THE FIFTH ELEMENT, A.I ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and STAR WARS EPISODE II, Scott's vision of a neon-soaked Los Angeles is one of the many astounding and unforgettable images throughout the film. Harrison Ford is in superb form as the man sent to bring in a replicant cyborg. The cinematography is breath-taking, the special effects are great and Vangelis' original score is excellent. With so many good points it's hard to name them all, Blade Runner is a true classic. Less can be said about the lack of extras on the DVD, with nothing for fans. Still, there's talk of a re-release of the DVD with more extras. I'm waiting...
B0000029GA|5.0|Of the six discs Nas has put out (5 studio and one not,Lost Tapes)I never had this disc in my collection until now.I can remember when he first came on the scene with Main Source in Live at the BBQ.His lyrical prowess was as good then as it is now.With each disc you can hear the difference in style and scheme,but you know off the bat it's Nas.But after hearing and listening to Illmatic,I see why it's heralded as a classic.It took me a few listenings to feel it,after all I went back in time to his beginning.It took my mind back in the days when the old school was ending and the new school was rising,in which Nas was on the cover of The Source with the caption reading &quot;Nas,Leader of the New School&quot;.As he says in Destroy &amp; Rebuild &quot;besides my man Ricky,Nas the true ruler is back&quot;;he never left.If you love rap you owe it to yourself to own this disc,it's the beginning of an era.And look forward to his new studio disc &quot;God's Son&quot; to be released soon.Only a few rappers are as good and as deep as Nas,and I mean a Few.
0425163407|5.0|This was the first Dr. Scarpetta book I have read and I was completely entranced! With the constant twists in the plot I didn't know up from down, and unlike normally I had no clue as to who the killer was until the very end. It was so good I was almost reluctant to finish it!I was so into the book that one night after reading the part where she discovers she might be dealing with smallpox I had to convince myself that I wasn't the one who had been exposed to Smallpox, before I could sleep. Although somewhat disturbing and graphic in certain parts this was an excellent book and if you love deliciously scary fiction, I highly reccomend this. I can't wait to read more Dr. Scarpetta novels!
B00004T8RK|5.0|The first time I heard this album was on Broadway in Seattle<br />at an espresso stand, and I had to ask who it was. Don't get<br />me wrong I have never disliked Pearl Jam, they just weren't one<br />of the bands in my music collection. Months later a friend gave<br />me a copy after I had expressed my enthusiasm for it(he was a<br />big PJ fan). It's just one of those experiences that only gets<br />better every time you listen to it. Matt Cameron is a<br />phenomenal drummer and he adds just the right touch to the<br />Jam. I could go on about the songs but I swear there isn't<br />one song on it that I don't enjoy. They were definitely<br />listening to the river on this one.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater's new album has blown my mind.  Particularly cd two.  This band never ceases to amaze me.  There are some people that have complained about the new direction went with this new album, but they just don't appreciate the shear talent that these guys have. Its good to know that there are still a band that even though it is not the most popular, still takes risks.

0789723107|5.0|Krug has put together a deceptively short and simple book that deals with the diffucult topic of how to design and put together web sites. This is not a book about hacking HTML or putting together a Flash animation, in fact you'd be hard pressed to find much of any talk about any technologies in Krug's book, but I think that is a relief. He had a unique way of in very simple words explaining some of the more difficult concepts in web design, such as web site navigation. It is a good book for both those experienced in web design and development and those just starting out. And the title in a wonderful way sums up the book - &quot;Don't make me think!&quot;
B00005RHGK|1.0|The creeper was a gargoyle with a chemistry set.  He drove that truck like a \\"bat\\" out of heck.  He must also be a mechanic to keep the truck running.  It was a very fuel efficient truck, or he has his very own endless fuel source.  It's not like he is going to pull up to the local gas station, even though everyone in the movie is too stupid to notice him.  <BR>    In short:  This movie was an extreme waste of time.  <BR>    More detailed:  The chemist bat who never gets pulled over for speeding eats body parts of people to gain them for himself.  The teenagers were idiots.  They see the bat throwing bodies down a pipe and do they go and tell police?  No, they go back and crawl in head first.  FYI, the pipe was just a passage between the cellar and the upper level; why did it have water in it?  The boy inside that grabbed his ankle would not have been alive.  If you have your chest cut open like that, you die.  The negative pressure that fills your lungs is neutrallized and you exsanguinate or asphyxiate.  <BR>    The psychic was a really stupid move.  She acted as a narrator rather than a character in the movie, and the make up was terrible.  The bat was wearing contacts.  <BR>    This movie was not scary at all, only startling.  In the end, you're glad that the boy dies for being so stupid in the beginning.  I'm sorry if I spoiled this movie for you, but if this prevents you from seeing this movie, then I've done you a favor.
B000069HKH|2.0|<br />My wife and I were riding in the car, bored to tears by this album, and started changing the words.  If you've listened to the rising, you know which tune the altered words fit into (Empty Sky).  Springsteen is trying hard to sound profound on some tracks (Empty Sky), and trying hard to recapture the lost party days of youth on others (Mary's Place).  Some tracks, such as Worlds Apart, sound ridiculous -- the multi-cultural thing doesn't work -- Bruce isn't Sting or Paul Simon, and it shows.  There have been many raves about the album, but if anyone else's name was on the cover, I doubt it would get more than two stars and a ho-hum.  Save your money and buy some of his older stuff, The Rising is lukewarm in places and sounds forced in others.
B000002J20|5.0|How do you rate an album with the scope of \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\", which seems to be an album which you either really hate or you really like?  First, you listen to it carefully, and often.  So I listened to this album for four days straight before sitting down to write this review.<br />This album would have to be classed as progressive, because I am unaware of what to call it.  If you think of a classical symphony or concerto, played in a rock music style by rock instruments, you would have what this album really is.  Because of the extensive nature of each piece, there is a lot of opportunity to create a musical theme and then to exploit it.  However, each piece really is part of the whole, and should be considered movements, as an example the movements in Bach's Brandenburg concertos.<br />The first movement is titled \\"The Revealing Science of God: Dance of the Dawn\\".  I read the lyrics a lot before I got it (at least, I think I get it).  The lyrics have no meaning, and they also have meaning.  Confusing?  Oh yeah.  Understand that the point of the movement is to get the listener to realize that there are bits and pieces, and understanding is something that rarely, if ever, comes all at once.  Jon Anderson uses the sound of the words to create an almost meaning, but more of a subliminal meaning.  The whole point is that you are to realize that we do not understand, but we have to keep trying.  I suppose to a certain extent that a further meaning to the song is that when you have found the meaning, you found it within yourself, which is where true understanding must derive anyway.  It matters not your faith on this one, because all the major religions say this in one way or the other.  Buddhists focus on meditation, the purpose of which is to discover truth within yourself.  Christians rely on faith, which comes from where?  Within you!  Sufficient examples to make the point.<br />The second movement is \\"The Remembering: High the Memory\\".  This song is about a concept that I struggled with quite a bit.  On the one hand, the song is about the breadth of knowledge that is available to humankind and to any one individual.  However, the song is also trying to say that while that knowledge is available, each of us can only access that knowledge when it becomes a part of our personal knowledge, and more than just having it as personal knowledge, it must be accessible and understood to be useful.  Another way of saying this is that we have realms of knowledge that are potentially available to each of us.  However, only that knowledge which we personally understand and can access will be of any value to us.  Therefore, the first movement describes the seeking for knowledge and truth.  This movement says that only that knowledge which you understand and have made part of you will have value in that seeking.<br />The third movement is \\"The Ancient:  Giants under the Sun\\".  The concept of this song is relatively simple compared to the first two movements.  This song pushes through the envelope of recorded time to access forgotten knowledge from civilizations that came before.  While the song is relatively easy to understand, the music is more interwoven and complex, and intertwines elements that are intended to evoke those earlier cultures.  Therefore, the instruments flavor this movement with musical elements from around the globe to help give the feeling that the song of our knowledge is made up of many parts from many people.  While the music sounds relatively simple, it is as technically detailed and complex as any concerto or symphony I can recall.  While Steve Howe's guitar may be pivotal in this song according to Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman's keyboards are essential to the ethnicity of the various portions of the music.  Incredible composition.  This movement adds to the seeking of the first movement, the understanding of the second movement, that there is knowledge yet available to be discovered from all cultures and civilizations that may no longer exist, but that understanding is still available if we know where and how to look for it.<br />The fourth and final movement is \\"Ritual:  Nous Sommes Du Soleil\\".  Interestingly enough, this composition is relatively accessible philosophically, because it is a description of the human condition.  This piece is intended to communicate that we have the ability to seek knowledge and understanding.  Part of that knowledge and understanding is the constant struggle between good and evil, and how that plays a part of how we view that knowledge.  However, this piece also reinforces the earlier movements in that we have the ability learn and to understand.  We were granted this ability by a higher power.<br /> I've read that Rick Wakeman complained that there was too much filler in this composition.  I suppose that could be said of many of the classical compositions by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Bach, and on and on.  However, I've also read that later Steve Howe thought that this was some of his best work ever.  This work is magnificent in conception and scope.  It is not readily accessible to the casual listener.  The very best way to understand this music is to get a bottle of really good wine, sit in the middle of the room in a recliner, turn out most or all of the lights, and listen and feel.  Start by paying attention to the emotion and feeling of the words, because that was the intent of the lyrics.  Once you begin to understand what was intended, then this work becomes accessible.  It is one of the most incredibly complex pieces of music I've ever heard, and I have listened to everything from classical to death metal.  This music isn't for everyone, but those who can get into it, it is fantastic.ivilizations that may no longer exist, but that understanding is still available if we know where and how to look for it.<br />The fourth and final movement is \\"Ritual:  Nous Sommes Du Soleil\\".

B000023VR6|4.0|Dr. Dre has come out with another fine album, featuring the likes of many artists including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, and more. The first single, 'Still Dre', has a really cool beat and the rapping is great! But probably the best song is Forgot About Dre featuring Eminem. Dr. Dre describes his own life and the jealousy of others towards him. He also describes-it is true to the song's title-about people who forgot about him after his first albums and then came back begging when he struck it rich. Other good songs are The Next Episode, Big Egos, and Hittman's Ackrite as well as the ending song Message.<br />Certainly an album that all rap fans should have in their collections!

B00003CWRX|5.0|The moral philosopher and economist Adam Smith warned that businessmen are inclined to collude together to defraud the consumer.  Indeed, the foremost champion of capitalism did not shy away from the reality of human nature.  Legitimate self interest regretfully sometimes deteriorates into vile and despicable behavior.  The Insider primarily deals with the moral corruption of the tobacco industry.  Russell Crowe brilliantly portrays Jeffrey Wigand, the real-life scientist who blew the whistle regarding the lies told to the general public.  The latter were deceived into believing that tobacco products were not really all that dangerous.  Alas, Wigand pays an enormous price for this act of courage.  He trusts Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer for Sixty Minutes to put his story before the American people.  The top executives at CBS NEWS, however, are reluctant to rock the boat.  We are soon disgusted by their kowtowing to the powers that be within the board rooms of the major tobacco companies.<br />The movie admittedly is not a completely accurate depiction of the actual events.  Nonetheless, it's still loyal to the main themes of Wigand's predicament.  The scientist is persecuted by the legal teams representing the tobacco interests for allegedly violating a contractual agreement to keep his mouth shut.  In other words, evil is to be hidden from view---or you will be sued! This great film will remind one that laissez faire capitalism is inherently impossible.  There will always be a need for government oversight and media investigations of wrongdoing.  Capitalism may very well be the best economic system ever devised, but continuous check and balances are mandatory to preserve both its viability and integrity.  I wholeheartedly recommend that you see The Insider.  It will give both the Ayn Rand acolytes and the followers of Ralph Nader much to think about.
B00006AFUR|5.0|When I first heard the song Capricorn by 30 Seconds To Mars, I fell in love with the singer's voice and the unique, spacey-rock sound of the music. After I realized that the singer is the famous actor Jared Leto, I was amazed. I didn't think that actors were talented as singers, too..since most actors and actresses who try it usually fail. I bought the album almost right away, and each song is very impressive. The lyrics are thought-provoking and real. The music is original and sometimes eerie. There are no faults in this album as far as I'm concerned. Leto is extremely talented and so is his band. I encourage anyone who has good taste in new rock to buy this album. Trust me, you won't regret it.

B000008H1Y|5.0|Jethro Tull, what a wonderful name for a band. The very mention of their name conjures up images of Ian Anderson, that long haired flautist, dressed in his shabby rain coat, hopping around on one leg, but still looking every inch the Rock star, leading his ever changing line up of cohorts to ever greater deeds of daring do.<br />Jethro Tull started out in Birmingham, England, in November 1967, hitting instant success with their first album \\"This Was\\" in October 1968 and third single \\"Living In The Past\\" in May 1969. By this time they had already left behind their basic blues roots and had shifted to be moulded into the image carrying vehicle that Ian Anderson required. This produced some of the best blending of blues, jazz, a smidgeon of Rhythm & Blues, definite progressive rock elements, for good measure throw in a healthy dose of medieval folk music with your basic hard rock, some fine musicianship, plus the use of whatever instrument suited the song, and there your are, music that will make you a millionaire many times over. They go back a long way now, but to this very day continue to produce music that is as relevant, interesting and entertaining as ever.<br />This album, \\"Songs From The Wood\\", was the second of five albums put together by this particular line up of Jethro Tull, which held together for almost five years (an eternity in Tull time). That is if you don't include the addition of David Palmer on keyboards (who had been aboard as arranger since the first album anyway) and the tragic death of John Glassock to be replaced by Dave Pegg (formerly of Fairport Convention) on bass. Dave Pegg is still a member of Jethro Tull today, splitting his time between working with the Tull and the Fairports.<br />\\"Songs From The Wood\\" came out after the harder rockin album \\"Too Old To Rock `n' Roll To Young To Die\\". Ian Anderson's reaction to the arrival of Punk Rock.<br />Never one to shy away from fashion and always sticking to his roots (with the charts full of albums by the likes of the Damned, Adam and the Ants, etc.), Jethro Tull released their most folk orientated album to date. Of course, the fickle press leapt on this and slammed the band for being way beyond their sell by date. Particularly Ian Anderson was held up to be an object of ridicule for his appearance and songwriting skills.<br />Not that the record buying public took much notice as the album shot up both the American and British charts researching number eight and thirteen respectively. By now the band was one of the most successful bands of all time, living in tax exile, and their live concerts were a sell out all over the world.<br />The music is sensational throughout its nine cuts. \\"Hunting Girl\\", \\"Songs From The Wood\\" with its excellent middle verse of<br /> \\"Let me bring you all things refined;<br />  Galliards and lute songs served in chilling ale;<br />  Greetings, well - met fellow, hail!<br />  I am the wind to fill your soil.<br />  I am the cross to take your nail;<br />  A singer of those ageless times -<br />With kitchen prose, and gutter rhymes\\",<br />and \\"The Whistler\\" are maybe three of the best folk rock songs ever made, certainly up there with anything else I can think of.<br />\\"Ring out Solstice Bells\\" evokes the spirit of Christmas like no other, with rhytmic handclaps, the wonderfully monickered Barriemore Barlow let loose on all sorts of percussion, whilst the flute weaves its magic spell over a relentless backbeat.<br />Penultimate song \\"Pibrack (copin hand)\\" is where longtime Tull guitarist Martin Barre is allowed to step out into the spotlight with the electric guitar with some marvelous interplay between himself and Anderson. In folk rock terms the equivalent of Blackmore playing against Jon Lord in the old Deep Purple. A wonder for the ears.<br />All in all \\"Songs From The Wood\\" is a masterful album, full of varied surprises, and if you like this collection, look out Tull's follow up album \\"Heavy Horses\\" just as good ..... but different.<br />I leave you with my favorite Rock `n' Roll Trivia question. Jethro Tull have had three lead guitarists during their 33-year career, all from Birmingham. The first was Mick Abrahams, who lasted one year and one album. Martin Barre recorded all the other Tull albums. But who was the guitarist inbetween Abrahams and Barre? He went on to become a huge International star himself, and appeared with Jethro Tull on the Rolling Stones Rock `n' Roll Circus.<br />Mott the Dog.I leave you with my favorite Rock `n' Roll Trivia question.

6304196784|5.0|This classic 1988 British comedy, which was written by and stars John Cleese (Fawlty Towers, Monty Python), has got to be one of the funniest films of all time, and it is certainly one of my favourites.  <br />Briefly, the story involves four criminals who steal a fortune in diamonds.  One ends up in prison (having been ratted on by two of his not-so-loyal mates); ironically, just prior to his arrest he had secretly taken the jewels and rehidden them.  So the film revolves around the attempts of the others to discover the location of the jewels.  <br />The plot is indeed a good one, but what really makes this film exceptional and so hilarious is the colourful cast of characters and the splendid performances of all involved.  There simply isn't one weak performance here.  <br />The central character is a beautiful and spirited American woman named Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), the lone female in the gang and the only intelligent one of the lot.  Wanda's one weakness, however, is her penchant for hearing foreign languages--it's something that really turns her on!  This makes for much hilarity between her and her fellow gangster, Otto (whom Wanda has been trying to pass off as her brother), as Otto rattles off every known Italian food dish, type of cheese, and so on, in his attempts to seduce Wanda.  Otto (Kevin Kline), by the way, is a highly paranoid, Nietzsche-reading yet empty-headed, Anglophobic, trigger-happy lunatic who thinks he's an intellectual and enjoys sniffing his armpits.  He's a flamboyant personality to say the least, and one which Kline manages to carry off wonderfully--I simply cannot imagine anyone doing a better job.  These two are the real powerhouses of the gang.  <br />Then there's poor Ken (Michael Palin (Monty Python)), who's an avid animal lover--a fact which provides the basis for some extremely funny scenes.  He's a humorously pathetic character--a little bit on the simple side with the worst stammer ever, and if  there's a show-stealer (and Isay \\"if\\" for they're all so good), for me it's Ken.  He's simply hilarious, and the interplay between him and the nasty Otto is simply priceless.  (It's a bit like watching a cat relentlessly toying with a poor, helpless little mouse).  Lastly, one mustn't forget John Cleese, who portrays Archie, the rather reserved barrister representing George, the incarcerated gang member, and who, I just have to add, has Wanda in a fit of ecstasy (unbeknownst to himself) in one hilarious scene when he starts spouting Russian.  <br />In conclusion, the film (which has a running time of 108 minutes) is definitely a must-see for fans of British comedy or, for that matter, for anyone looking for a thoroughly entertaining not to mention hilarious film.  I've seen it a number of times and certainly don't regret purchasing it.  It's definitely one to watch and rewatch.  And if you've enjoyed the film, by all means check out Fawlty Towers (also co-written by and starring John Cleese and also featuring an abundance of visual humour).  You'll not regret it--it's simply one of the funniest shows ever made.  And so is this film!<br />Very highly recommended!

B000001E7V|5.0|I realize Tricky has incorporated many elements from other peoples' work, but that doesn't make these songs any less genius or mind-blowing.  Martina, his main singer here who he found on the street, has an incredible voice, very sexy.  <br />\\"Ponderosa\\" is a quirky track with strange percussion.  \\"Black Steel\\" takes an NWA rap, gives it to Martina (to unusual effect) and transforms it into a full-blown rocker.  \\"Strugglin'\\" is a disturbing vision of insanity with bizarre sounds like dripping water, clicking cameras and sirens that get sped up and cut off.<br />Pretty much everything else (if you wanted to) could be programmed together to make the perfect atmospheric soundtrack for an evening of romance - very sexy.  Not everyone will see it that way, but it works for me.  What is undenyable is that each of these songs stand out on their own.  And my favorite is \\"You Don't\\" (I fight evil with evil) it's so . . . high.

There is a continuity to this album that is amazing..Each song seems to flow into the next. We also know that mp3s don't have the same sound quality that one can get from a cd. This disc has subtle textural shifts that requires repeated listens. At first I was surprised. This is not the Beck with the hip hop beats, and foolish lyrics..Instead he has given us something from his heart..When I heard Lost Cause I broke down and cried.....Not since Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot have I found something that I just can't quit listening to.
B000002UA0|5.0|The Beatles' SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is truly a phenomenal album and hailed as a psychedelic masterpiece.  But when it comes to psychedelia, PIPER makes PEPPER look like child's play.  <br />Many say this is Floyd's best album and I would agree, but the band that made it is really very different from the one that went on to make mega-bucks and sell out stadiums.  Syd Barrett was the mastermind of the band at this point.  When he went off the deep end, the whole dynamics of the band changed.<br />So we have this brilliant, flashing moment of magic that not even Syd, song-writing genius that he was, could touch when he got it together enough to make subsequent solo albums.  <br />I'm not going to analyze these songs, as I could blab ad infinitum. Just know you won't ever hear anything else quite like it.

I read harry potter after reading this and laughed, actually laughed that jk rowling could win awards and high praise for her book with somthing this good kicking about.<BR> This is your favourite book waiting to be read, like the hindu scriptures in ambition and depth, and like steppenwolf for contravsy and gripping plot, you will love it. And if you don't then you should probablly go back to your bookshop and buy another copy to make sure they sold you the right story.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Although I enjoy watching Buffy, I am not a huge fan of the show.  I bought this CD as a spur of the moment buy, and was not sure why I bought it.  But, I am so glad I did!  In addition to having all the songs played in the &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; episode of Buffy, it has three (3) themes from other episodes.  These three songs were /very/ good - they  made me wish a CD containing themes from more of the episodes be published.  I would recommend this CD even if you aren't a huge Buffy fan, (and if you are, I would recomend it that much more).  This will be great for long car rides, becuase it is nearly the same as listening to an entire episode.

It was one of the most rewarding experiences in reading literature that I have ever had and I am an avid reader. Recently I had been looking for the definitive Complete Works of William Shakespeare, and bought Mr. Bevington's edition immediately. I was not disappointed. This is the way Shakespeare should be read by modern audiences. His introductions offer many insights and are a joy to read. No library is complete without Shakespeare, this anthology of the Bard is surely one of the best one out there.

B0000062FL|4.0|This second album from Santana is the first Santana album I had ever heard, and is the one that got me interested in their first and third albums. Notice I didn't say any albums after Gregg Rolie left the group! I am a very big fan of Rolie's singing, songwriting, and organ playing, and I may be the only one that says this, but I think Santana has never truly recovered since Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon left to form Journey. Don't get me wrong--I still love Santana. But I've seen the 2002 edition of the group, and I think every one in that 1970 version was replaceable except Rolie. They actually have THREE guys replacing Gregg now: One to play the keyboards, and two to sing his old parts. There may be FOUR guys altogether, if they have another guy to write some of the new songs. But back in the day, Gregg did all of the singing and songwriting of the English-language songs, plus he was one of the best organists I have ever heard--an ability he certainly carried over into Journey. I think some of the most powerful and emotional songs of Santana's were the ones Gregg wrote and sang--songs on this album like \\"Mother's Daughter\\" and \\"Hope your Feeling Better\\", and songs from their first album like \\"You Just Don't Care\\", \\"Persuasion\\", and \\"Shades of Time\\". For a band known for jamming, those were some fairly decent and concise pop songs, performed Santana-style. Gregg's vocals had so much conviction, as though he was really feeling the words that he wrote--his bluesy delivery and soulful organ reminding me of 'another' Gregg--Gregg Allman from the Allman Brothers Band. You could almost say that the early-seventies Santana sounds a lot like the early-Allman Bros. Band with latin percussions. You could also draw a comparison of Carlos Santana's jazzy-Gibson SG guitar tone to the guitar sound and style of early Dickey Betts--an dramatic and emotional sound that at times bordered on \\"heavy metal\\", but never went fully in that direction. <br />As far as Santana's instrumental songs, They're an awful lot like Jeff Beck's: They can either be incredibly beautiful or incredibly boring. On this album, I found \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" to be one of his most beautiful to date--a romantic guitar instrumental that proves that love songs don't have to say anything at all (reminds me a lot of Jeff Beck's, \\"I Can't Give Back the Love I Feel For You\\".) On the boring side, there is \\"Incident At Neshabur\\", which starts out sounding exciting and dramatic, but it drags on and falls apart towards the end.<BR>Of course, you have the FM hits \\"Blackmagic Woman\\" and \\"Oye Como Va\\" and some minute-or-two long, pointless \\"conga\\" filler music: \\"Se A Cabo\\" and \\"El Nicoya\\", and that's pretty much the album. But again, the bright spots for me are all the songs Gregg Rolie either sang or wrote: \\"Hope Your Feeling Better\\", \\"Blackmagic Woman\\", and \\"Mother's Daughter\\". It was he, in my opinion, that made the early Santana \\"tick\\", and made the group the multi-dimensional group it was. His talents are surely lacking in the new Santana. I would love to see Rolie and Carlos work together again somehow, but its been over 30 years. There was as much chemistry between them as Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, and I could really hear it on this album. Something really bad must have happened to keep them apart all this time. I wouldn't even mind seeing Gregg Rolie back in Journey, but he was never appreciated in that group once Steve Perry took over the lead vocals and songwriting duties--once Journey decided they needed an attracive, sexy \\"front man\\" to bring them the popularity and the female fans they so desired. I understand Gregg Rolie has a new solo CD out, and is struggling to make it on his own. But it's just a shame that someone with as much singing, songwriting, and playing talent as he has, was never meant for much commercial success with two very popular San Francisco groups. Santana did continue to make great pop songs in the mid-to-late 70s and early-80's and they're still my favorite San Francisco band. I just think they sounded better, as they did here, with Gregg Rolie as their main singer and songwriter.

Explosions occur before the planes bomb actually hit the ground soldiers die before the bullets hit them or the bomb explodes.  The planes, all digital, shrink as the flyby at times they get smaller than the actors.  This has nothing to do with distance or any other factor besides poor art direction.  Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of this movie for sometime.  The story of the windtakers should be given more respect than what this movie trys to give it.
B000060MMI|5.0|Flogging Molly has struck gold with their new album &quot;Drunken Lulabies.&quot; Their music is a combination of traditional irish songs, done with an upbeat &quot;punkish&quot; twist. If you are a fan of Irish music... or a punk fan, than this cd is a must have!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac is a good example of successful compilations are made.  While only covering the Buckinham-Nicks version of the band, the two CD set offers a great range of songs from thier career.  Unlike the previous greatest hits (which was only 1 disc), Very Best includes The Chain, Landslide, Gold Dust Woman, and even the obscure hit Family Man, on top of having all the other classics.  The inclusion of songs like Think About Me, Love In Store, World Turning, No Questions Asked and Paper Doll proves that the set truely covers this era exstensively.  <BR> <BR>The remastering is decent and allows the listener to hear parts of the songs that were not obvious before.  The drums sound much crisper and songs from Rumours, The &quot;White Album,&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot; seem much clearer.  <br />The single version of Rhiannon, Over My Head, and Sisters of the Moon are also a plus, although they can take awhile to grow on you.  If you are use to the album versions, these will seem kind of odd and unfulfilling.  After a few listens however, one will notice the heavy guitar layering and texturing.  These songs turn out to be quite cool. <br />The complilation will appeal to long-time fans because of the inclusion of bonus material on the first disc, as well as the song Go Insane from the Dance. It will appeal to more casual fans because of the extent that it covers their catalog.<br />Some songs that were not included are Eyes of the World, Oh Diane (which was a big hit in Europe &amp; Japan), Big Love (the original), and Crystal.  All of these would have made the compilation even stronger but like any Best Of, you can't have everything.  All and all it is a nice set and I recommend it to anyone who wants a MAC ATTACK!!
0140182829|2.0|I taught this novel in my French Lit class this week. I was terribly disappointed by this translation, which is British, and very old. My students, for the most part well-read graduate students, didn't get the novel at all. This shoddy and dated translation does not grasp the lyricism, the poetry, the imagination and the easy flow of Alain-Fournier's prose. There are many better translations. I fear this one was chosen because it was easiest to get a hold of, probably because the publishers didn't have to pay a  fee. I find this to be a shameful sign of the direction publishing is taking these days. LE GRAND MEAULNES is truly one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Ok, I'm a really big Superman fan first of all. But, I am also a really big \\"superhero\\" fan. I loooooved this movie. I wasn't sure how Tobey Maguire was going to fill the role, after all, I always saw him as a little kid. Well!! Little kid is all grown up in this flick, and all I can say is \\"Woohoo!! Those tights are FANTASTIC!\\" LOL I recommend this movie to anyone, it's great for the whole family. Don't miss it!!

B00003CXBK|5.0|PRINCESS MONOKE blew me away in the theatre; it blows me away on the DVD. It is definitely worth owning; I'm glad I own it; one of the better works of anime. It is hard for me to understand why it bombed at the boxoffice; many still don't seem to to be that open to anime -- meaning, that many are missing out on some real treasures; and this is definitely one. The manager of the place where I rent DVDs -- who doesn't even like anime -- says he likes it: That's a good sign!
B00006EXDM|4.0|If you aren't a die-hard Stones fan but enjoy their music, this is the compilation for you. From a seven year stretch from '64 to '71 you get to hear vast development from Mick and the Boys.  Though Rolling Stones' hits may be difficult to get entirely under your thumb, this compilation proves it can hit on all the highlights from their early years and make for a thoroughly enjoyable listen.<br />Though all the songs collectively on this compilation would add up to 5-stars, its hard to award any compilation that wasn't intended by the artist originally as a cohesive work that highest of high reviewers garnishment.  If you are a true Stones maniac, go get the individual albums, preferably in vinyl, and revel in your revelry.  If not, this is a great place to start.  You may have to augment with more of their recent hits compilations, but this one isn't a CD that gets played initially and then is placed on the shelf to collect dust.<br />Though it's true that sometimes you can't always get what you want, with this compilation you can come awfully close.
B0000636UN|3.0|I am a very big Sheryl fan but I must say that I'm a little disappointed with this effort.  I was into &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; from the start, and I'm actually not sick of it.....yet. The first time I heard &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, I thought it sounded a little dumb, but once I gave it the benefit of the doubt and listened to it a few more times, I was into it. &quot;You're An Original&quot; is quite good with Lenny.  &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; is good, too, but too bad the chorus gets murdered by Sheryl &quot;scooping&quot; for the notes and overdoing it.  I liked her TV 9/11 version better.  &quot;Abilene&quot; is a great song.  Thank God Natalie Maines doesn't snarl and whine on this song as she did with &quot;Strong Enough&quot; on the Central Park live album. I can't even listen to that version!! (Personally, I prefer the version of &quot;Strong Enough&quot; that Sheryl did with Stevie Nicks on Storytellers). And speaking of Stevie, she gets accolades from Sheryl and the liner notes claim that Stevie sang on &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; --- um, how come I couldn't hear Stevie in the mix?? Unfortunately, Stevie's vocals are completely lost (which is a shame, since you can obviously hear Sheryl singing on Stevie's &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot; record.) THAT was disappointing for me.  After C'mon C'mon (which is a good song, even if you can't hear Stevie singing), the songs seem to drag until &quot;Abilene&quot;.  In my opinion, there is bad sequencing of the songs on this disc.  &quot;Diamond Road&quot; is a good song.....but don't put it before &quot;It's Only Love&quot; (another good song - and I can hear Gwyneth Paltrow on this one - a nice surprise).  Having a heavy string section on both of those songs back to back makes the songs drag, and the two songs almost even start off the same!!  The songs in the middle aren't Sheryl's finest.  I regret to say that there are some filler-in songs here, which is unheard of on a SherylCrow effort. &quot;It's So Easy&quot; is cheesy.  Too bad it's so easy to diss. &quot;Over You&quot; seemed a little annoying at first, then I liked the part when the guitars cut in, but then the chorus sounded screechy and whiny.  &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; doesn't sound like Sheryl. &quot;Hole in My Pocket&quot; is groovy and &quot;Weather Channel&quot; is awesome. Out of all the songs, only &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, &quot;You're An Original&quot;, &quot;Abilene&quot; and &quot;Weather Channel&quot; have earthy lyrics that are vintage Sheryl Crow.  The rest sounds like stuff we have all heard before. <br />All in all, there are some good spots on this record, but I don't think Sheryl should have used all of her &quot;guest&quot; stars to help her on this album (BAD trend among artists these days).  She already had a star-studded cast on Central Park.  Another thing that blows -- all of the Britney inspired pictures in the CD liner notes.  Sheryl is very beautiful and she doesn't look 40 at all.  She easily looks 10 years younger, even more.  Why the heck is she dressing up like Britney, especially when Sheryl's been pretty vocal about pop stars these days (and even makes reference to it in &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;!!) Don't get that one.  Is she trying to look &amp; feel younger than 40?  Somehow, that's the feeling I get with this Sheryl album.  I hope her next effort showcases her obvious talent, not her attempts to keep up with the music industry.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I remember when I first listened to Andrew W.K.'s I Get Wet.  I wsa sitting on a bus bound for Edinburgh from London, and I had bought this album on a whim after hearing all these English music writers gush over it.  I popped it into my discman, and was assaulted by the opening notes of It's Time to Party.  I was stunned.  My jaw literally dropped; I couldn't believe the sonic assault that this man had crafted.  \\"Okay,\\" I thought, \\"This is fun, but he can't keep it up.\\"  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The album is just one rocking track after another; it is loud even on low volume.  At first I hated it, for there was no variation in the songs. But over time, it kept finding its way back into my CD player.  The music can only be described as the [illegitiment] child of 80's pop-rock and synth music hepped up on methamphetamines. Songs like Party Hard, Ready to Die, She is Beautiful, and I Get Wet are catchier than can be imagined on first listen, and the lyrics are so belligerent that you can't do anything but shake your head and laugh at them.  Mr. W.K. doesn't want to change the world with this album, and he doesn't want to make you yearn for lost love.  His only message is to go out and have fun, and sometimes that is the only message you need.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|They don't make movies this good very often.  Not many films anymore draw out the characters as well as this one does.  I felt like I actually got to know Leonard, probably because he introduced himself so many times to everyone he met.  It is apparent the crew paid attention and thought out what Pearce should do.  There are only a couple times he seems to remember something he shouldn't remember, but they are inconsequential.  There is one character, I won't say who, who actually left me with the feeling he is truly twisted.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in the last few years, and I completely recommend it.  Just make sure when you watch it you give it your undivided attention or you will get lost.

0790729377|5.0|A film without acting flaws, this \\"Streetcar\\" rattles through the steamy French quarter and takes you on an emothional roller-coaster -- at times gentle, brutal, sensual, quiet, loud -- and ultimately leaves you in \\"Elysian Fields\\" (Symbol of heaven).  Unfortunately, Kazan had to alter and thus soften the ending so that we are left not fully feeling the tragedy that has befallen Blanche AND her sister.<BR>The transfer, I feel, could have used some beefing in the sound department, but otherwise, I am quite contented with the result.  <BR>Vivien Leigh gives a well-orchestrated performance as the last of the Southern Belles who has lost all shreds of sanity.  Brando is a powerhouse who leaves the viewer as frightened as Blanche, and the rest of the ensemble are equally suited to the task.  Tenessee Williams only wrote a few really fine plays, and I suppose this is his finest moment.<BR>If you saw the film and did not care for it, I suggest another visit.  You might change your mind.  <BR>So many unforgettable truths in the picture:  \\"Deliberate cruelty is unforgivable,\\" is unforgettable.<BR>I notice that some reviewers complain of the format.  The film was shot prior to cinemascope.  Wide-screen was not around.  To present the film in this fashion would distort the actors.
B00006DEF9|5.0|\\"Singin' In the Rain\\" has finally gotten the \\"special\\" treatment this masterpiece deserves. The new digital transfer is stunning-- both visual and audio. I've seen this film I don't know how many times in theatres, including several screenings in the original 3-strip Technicolor. This transfer, as with \\"The Wizard of OZ,\\" is as close as you can get to seeing a 3-strip print in a theatre.<br />Many reviewers have complained about the commentary track and it is the low-point of this edition. So skip it, if you don't like it.<br />Instead, throw on the second disc, which is a goldmine. First, there is the excellent PBS documentary on the Arthur Freed Unit, \\"Musicals Glorious Musicals.\\" This is an often revealing 90-minute film about the musical films Freed produced. Plenty of great excerpts, too. It tends to puffery, but not excessively.<br />Then there is a new documentary, \\"What A Glorious Feeling,\\" on the making of \\"Singin' In the Rain.\\" Watching both these documentaries, you don't need the commentary track. Most of it was lifted from these documentaries.<br />In addition, this supplementary disc includes the songs used in \\"Singin' In the Rain,\\" as they first appeared in their original written for films and later films that used the songs again. Some of these are unintenionally funny today. But it is really a crash course in the history of movie musicals. My favorite is Eleanor Powell in the number that introduced \\"You Are My Lucky Star.\\" A beautfully done, very '30's black-and-white number that builds into an all stops-out dream-dance sequence. (Were Americans ever this innocent?) Others include Bing Crosby wonderful introducing \\"Beautiful Girls,\\" Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney introducing \\"Good Morning,\\" Cliff Edwards (aka Ukele Ike, Jiminy Crickett) introducing \\"Singin' In the Rain\\" with what appears to be every star then under-contract to M-G-M in 1929, \\"Broadway Melody\\" in a tremendous number led by the irreplaceable Eleanor Powell and support from some of thebest talent of the time including \\"eccentric dancer\\" Buddy Ebsen and the great singer Frances Langford--the best number by far in this retrospective. And there is another whole section of audio excerpts from the recording sessions.<br />In short, this is an incredible collection that any musical or film buff should treasure.<br />It is true, as one reviewer noted, that the \\"Broadway Melody\\" number in \\"Singin' In the Rain\\" is a flaw in the flow of the film. Pauline Kael pointed this out too. She considers the film a great one. For myself, I don't mind, the number is too damned well-conceived and entertaining. Again, thanks to being on DVD, you can jump to the next scene if you don't care to watch it. I've tried it and the film definitely runs smoother narratively. But I missed it, and played after the film.<br />If you love SITR, as I do, this is a must buy. If you're interested and have never seen it, rent it and decide for yourself.<br />Let's hope that Warner Brothers does a 50th anniversary edition of \\"Bandwagon\\" next year with a digital and audio refining that equals or surpasses this. And a better commentary track. Bet Scorssee would join in the commentary.<br />ONE LAST THING<br />\\"Singin' In the Rain\\" was not shot in widescreen, but in the only format used for studio pictures before the end of 1953. It was designed to be shown in 1.37:1, Which just about the ratio of most tv screens. YOU ARE NOT MISSING ANYTHING. I wish you young film buffs would educate yourselves about the history of film aspect ratios.<br />Also Michael Kidd had nothing whatsoever to do with the choregraphy in \\"Singin' In the Rain.\\" He comments on it, but never claims he did any of it, for the simple reason he did none. He was probably in New York over-seeing his legendary choregraphy for the original stage production of \\"Guys and Dolls.\\" Which is probably why he got the \\"Bandwagon\\" assignment a year after \\"Singin' In the Rain.\\" He did all the choregraphy in \\"Bandwagon\\" and the following year, 1954, for \\"7 Brides For 7 Brothers.\\"<br />Kelly and Donen worked in partnership on the choregraphy and direction \\"SITR.\\" And it is really impossible now to determine who was responsible for what.
0440217563|4.0|Okay..so I realize that Jamie isnt real, but how can you not love him? The things he says to Claire kill me..and that accent!! oooohhh!!! Anyways..this is the first book in the Outlander series that I have not given 5 stars...that's not to say that it wasnt an excellent book..it was, but it failed to move me as deeply as the 2 previous books. I was bothered by some of the things that happened during their separation..one of these things being revealed in the chapter \\"Daddy\\" I wont give away what happened, but I just was REALLY sick with Jamie during this section of the book. Also..I found their reunion to be lacking, but maybe that's just me...on the other hand..I really enjoyed the fact that we were able to get into Jamie's head in this book..before, we only knew him through Claire, but in Voyager we're given a closer look. Speaking of Claire, as much as I like her..she's a bit of a B**ch..I didnt care for how judgemental she was towards certain people because of their looks...also...cant these people have even one full day of peace? Anyways...This is definitely worth reading..while I'll admit that I'm going to take a break from this series for awhile..I'm most certainly going to keep on reading till the end...
B00004UEE5|5.0|This is by far my favorite recording of Mahler 5.  Best of all, the camera work is done, for the most part, in an intelligent manner.  When different sections or players have exposed or prominent parts, the camera is focused on them.  I would have liked to see a little more of the other players in the sections besides the principal players and those near them, but with the wonderful quality of the DVD, I can't really complain.  If you are a Brass player/afficionado, this disc is a must have, especially for horn players.  Clevenger leads the section to absolutely amazing heights, and his solo passages show a sensitivity and musicality that never fails to raise goosebumps every time I listen to/watch this DVD. ...
6305313687|3.0|This is an OK movie because of Norton and Furlong.  Pretty good direction, too.  But if you're a real movie afficianado, you'll find this flick's messages are so overt that it's almost hard to be entertained by the story.<br />For a better discussion of racism in the US, check out Spike Lee's \\"Bamboozled.\\"<br />In any case, the PC messages in this movie will make it dated in a decade or so, when PC switches to some other causes, or people no longer understand late-90s morale qualities.  Hatred and racism will always be around to one degree or another, but the peculiarities of our times won't.<br />Norton's switch from buff evil Nazi to equal equality commando was a bit quick.  It's not like he'd never seen blacks or minorities or known them growing up in Venice Beach, CA.  Then he gets to prison and just one guy turns him around?<br />Overall, it's a pretty good movie showing why race hatred is stupid.  The biggest fault I have is them showing the brutality with which Norton defended his property as being a bad thing.  It's not!  You don't steal people's rides!  As a blue-collar guy, that pickup truck may be the only thing that gets him to work.  Work is the only thing that feeds his family.  Theft of a car is a direct assault on the safety of a man's family, therefor anyone caught red-handed stealing a vehicle deserves to be curbed.<br />-- JJ Timmins
B000002HAF|5.0|An original indie record from a seminal, true alternative band. Sparse melodies, unique vocal styles and music that can show finesse (Where Is My Mind) and then crash-land into blistering punk (Oh My Golly). I still think some of today's rock music (Korn, The Vines, Foo Fighters) is trying to catch up with this one. I first heard it in 1987, when I was a headstrong Rush fan and classic rocker. This album opened me up to the possibility that great music does not necessarily need airplay. If you're a rocker and rock out, BUY THIS ALBUM!
B000002L9M|5.0|Black Celebration brings together solid songwriting and innovative musicianship. Martin found his lyrical knack and Alan was really pushing the sampler to the forefront of musical composition. it all comes together to form a perfectly arranged package of dark romance, emotional ballads, industrialized pop and gothic melodies. this is the album that proved Depeche Mode was a BAND and not just an electronic pop group.
B00005NOOH|5.0|The footage, interviews, narration and historical accuracy will never be rivaled and sets the bar for documentaries.  <br />This truly is a must see as it will satisfy history buffs as well as those who are not as knowledgable about this war.  As I was watching it I wondered why it was not part of the curriculum in our high school history classes.<br />I highly recomend this collection.
B000059ZT4|5.0|This is not only the best Wailers album ever created, it's the best album ever created, I think. The first cd, \\"The Jamaican Version\\" represents the original 1972 sessions without the overdubs. But in some aspects, it is better than the overdubed album. All the tracks on the Jamaican Version are awesome, including two tracks that wern't on the original ablbum that was released. The second album, which was origianlly released in 1973 features overbubs, but is equally excellent. Every track is great, and is the greatest album I think Bob Marley & the Wailers ever put out. The album was also the first reggae album internationally sold. So i advise you to buy this deluxe edition. Because it's the best deluxe edition out there, and it's some of the greatest music out there. And wait till you hear the Jamaican versions of Concrete Jungle, Kinky Reggae, and No More Trouble. The Wailers really put it all into these recordings.
0671027344|2.0|I've heard this book compared to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", but it's not so don't read it with that impression.  \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a book of letters written by the main character, Charlie, who is a freshman in high school trying to find his place, while dealing with many of the challenges that face teenagers in today's world.  Charlie is shy, awkward, and introspective, yet he is also highly intelligent and aware.  I liked the character, I just didn't especially care for the story he was in.  There really wasn't much story, just a series of events, which is okay, but there wasn't much point that I could figure out (perhaps I'm just missing the point, I can except that).  Through the course of the book, Charlie either deals with or is directly or indirectly involved with issues of suicide, homosexuality, dating, sex, drugs, pregnancy, abortion, smoking, rape, molestation, death, depression, family instability...wow, need I go on?  The main problem with this book that I can see is that there is just too much STUFF going on for it to make a point about anything.  With all that is going on it is not surprising that Charlie has a breakdown of some sort at the end of the book, yet even that really seems very strange and I could never really figure out what was going on there, or the real reason for his breakdown (at least in \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" I could totally understand Holden's reason for loosing it).  There is nothing resolved, nothing learned, nothing to take away from this book except, yes--it sucks to be a teenager (duh!  Tell me something I don't know).  I give this book a thumbs up for being well written, having a main characater who was likeable and easy to relate to, and for having a ton less swearing in it then \\"Catcher in the Rye\\".  I give it a thumbs down for being overly pessimistic and slightly pointless.  Read it or don't, it doesn't matter to me--but I won't be reading it again.
6300214753|4.0|Ferris Bueller, the most popular guy in high school decides he wants to take a day off school and hang out with his friends.  It is a comedy and bends the rules of realism to produce a lot of slapstick comic moments.  The dialogue is sharp; the look is SO 80's (look back and weep at the shoulder pads).  It is a real trip down memory lane for me.  The film is all about grabbing life when you can.  There is a serious counterpoint made in the movie when Ferris's friend Cameron decides to stand up to his parents, I'm not sure why this is in the movie.  But all in all a pleasant hour and a half spent, remembering the joys of a misspent youth.
B00006G8LB|5.0|Spider-Man is the best movie I've seen in a long time. The actors were great. Tobey Maguire portrayed Peter Parker to the max. And to think he didn't even read a Spidey comic until he got the role. The effects were awesome. Some of the web-swinging scences we see are not really Tobey they are computer animated. And it's really hard to tell. I think this movie had great action and had a little romance, which is good.
B000002LB6|4.0|Erasure has named their second album \\"The Circus,\\" in which Vince Clarke and Andy Bell are ringmasters of a show filled with synth pop bliss that's deeper than it appears.  \\"Victim of Love,\\" \\"Sometimes,\\" and \\"It Doesn't Have to Be\\" are catchy, sugarcoated songs that have as much to offer in melody and craft as they do in hooks.  The most attention-getting track is \\"Hideaway\\" whose lyrics tell the story of a gay teen coming to terms with his sexuality and the society that rejects him.  It's not really that deep a social commentary on homophobia, but the song still passes with flying colors.  Other favorite tracks are the title song and the gloomy \\"Leave Me to Bleed.\\"  A record like this should have made Erasure a flash-in-the-pan synth act whose appeal wouldn't last beyond the 1980s.  But this fine record would lay as the foundation of a long and successful career that makes this duo among the most enduring and consistent in UK pop.

B000003N7R|5.0|Duke Ellington and John Coltrane are, individually, two tremendously influential and vital figures in the world of jazz who could do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.  But when you combine their talents on record, then you have a recording that's not only music, it's also a piece of history.  Though it's a brisk ride at 35 minutes in length, this collaborative effort brings out the best of both worlds during these seven tracks.  &quot;In a Sentimental Mood&quot; is a stroke of brilliance: Ellington's angelic piano touches are set to Coltrane's velvet-smooth sax during this gentle number.  It's a classic for the ages that must be heard to be believed.  The tempo picks up in &quot;Take the Coltrane,&quot; which has both in solid harmony.  Few tracks can top the ultrasuave swagger of &quot;Stevie,&quot; and the slow number &quot;My Little Brown Book&quot; has smooth touches which are underscored by Coltrane's light sax and drums by Sam Woodyard.  A mastery of style, technique, and substance, this album is one of those must-have items that'll make your collection all the more complete.<br />Duke Ellington.  John Coltrane.  Two visionaries.  One album.  Who can ask for anything more?
0345441184|1.0|okay so maybe it isnt that dirty but lets face it, these illicite... scenes leave little to the imagination. Though i really like the basis of this novel, it was very poorly written. The continuous protagonist tagteaming gets really tiresome and period of time is non-existant because you cant tell. I would sugest reading it if you are having religious conflicts because it raises some very interesting thoughts. If you are reading it because it sounds interesting and you like fantasy novels. DONT!<BR>because it isnt. By the way, some things you can add to it's moral repetour are things like incest(very graphic) adultery, Threesomes (rated R) and magic rituals(clothing optional) I suggest dont read it...and i can honestly say, either dont read it or Rent the Movie!

So he leaves town, and goes to another town named Chirstmastown. Jack goes back to Halloweentown with the idea of Christmas. Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York's Catherine O'Hara voices Sally a creation of an evil scientist (William Hickey). Okay where is Eastertown, Thanksgvingtown, April Fool's Day Town? Warning for parents this movie was rated PG for mild voilence.
B00005RHGK|2.0|JEEPERS CREEPERS<br />THE MOVIE: This was one of the best horror movies of last year. Starting like a road suspense film and making an interesting turn in going into the old 80's style monster genre, JEEPERS CREEPERS succeeds VERY successfully in making its audience exceptionally scared and totally intrigued. The acting, designs and shots in this movie are all very original and create an intense and dreading atmosphere. While it's not a masterpiece, JEEPERS CREEPERS is probably one of the most original thrillers you'll find these days. And you just can't forget that chilling final shot...<br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES (this refers to the NZ Region 4 edition): Just a theatrical trailer. A good theatrical trailer, but that's all. Boo-hoo.
B00003CXTG|5.0|\\"Pearl Harbor\\", directed by Michael Bay, is by all means no \\"Titanic\\", but it is definitely what I'd call underrated. People have rated this film so harshly and even after reading their reviews, I still don't understand why. But maybe it is just me. Anyway, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" involves around two childhood best friends, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), who have grown up together and now have joined the military and are based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While there, Rafe meets the lovely Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who is a nurse at the Pearl Harbor hospital and they soon fall in love. But then Rafe gets assigned to go off into aircraft battle and his plane is shot down into the water. Back in Hawaii, everyone thinks Rafe is dead when he doesn't return. So the devasted Evelyn and Danny are forced to move on and they eventually fall in love. But then Rafe comes back! And Evelyn must choose between Rafe and Danny, but that's all before the Japanese strikes Pearl Harbor. After the horrifying attacks on Pearl Harbor, Rafe and Danny are assigned a top secret mission which could be deadly. And while on the mission, another devasting tragedy occurs, and only one ends up coming back alive.<br />I thought this film was done brilliantly. The cinematography and the visual/sound effects were simply outstanding. The acting by the entire all-star cast (which also includes Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, and Jennifer Garner) was superb. \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a long film (183 minutes), but definitely well-worth it...I almost cried at the ending. The script was also well-done, and I saw nothing wrong with the love scenes--I thought they were a sweet touch to the film. The DVD is also not bad, packaged well with extras. The extras on the two-disc DVD set includes the making of \\"Pearl Harbor\\", a History Channel documentary on the unsung real-life heroes of Pearl Harbor, DVD-ROM features, and the Faith Hill music video \\"There You'll Be\\". The DVD is available in wide screen format.<br />I highly recommend \\"Pearl Harbor\\".<br />Score:<BR>98/100<BR>A+
B000002BPS|4.0|The offspring definitely have a lot of talent. This album, with the exeption of the disclaimer and intermission, is great. \\"Cool to hate\\" perfectly discribes the type of person we see so much these days, and \\"I choose\\" is nothing short of brilliant. If you're an offspring fan, espeially if you liked americana, get this CD.
B00005JL0I|5.0|Silly but fun &quot;Bond&quot; movie.  Great time capsule of 60's movie-making excess but includes some really great stuff -- from the opening titles, to &quot;the Look of Love.&quot;  Bought the DVD version really just to replace my old VHS version.
B00006AW2G|5.0|A prime time Rolling Stones record for sure.  Rock, Country, and acoustic gems throughout.  Gimmee Shelter is one spooky opening number and Love In Vain gives us the blues.  Then Country Honk is a comical take on the classic Honkey Tonk Women.  Live With Me features adrive bass line and gutsy singing from Jagger.  Not to mention a super saxaphone solo by Bobbie Keys.  Let It Bleed is a country flavored rocker with super piano and guitar tones.<br />The second half continues the great moments.  Midnight Rambler is a haunting jam.  Its a little stark here as compared to the live version on Ya Ya's.  Nontheless, its sure got plenty of rock n roll.  Keith's first complete solo lead vocal on You've Got The Silver is a successful one as his singing stands strong on emotion if not technical brilliance.  Monkey Man has cool guitar riffs which blend well the piano.  The closing track, You Can't Always Get What You Want utilizes the special effects of the choir for a nice gospel feel.  Another winning Jagger vocal.<br />Play it loud and play it often.  This album is a winner on all fronts.
B00005JKG7|4.0|Welcome to Antonio Bay, a small coastal community that is about to celebrate it's 100 birthday unaware that an ancient curse looms over the town bringing with it a night of retribution by a group of very angry ghosts.    The spooky festivities start early when some poltergiest activity unnerves the central charactors in the film. An eerie, glowing fog engulfs a fishing boat out at sea and the three drunken sailors are quickly slaughtered by the ghosts. Back in town, Father Malone(Hal Holbrook) discovers his grandfathers dusty old diary hidden behind a wall and proceeds to read it, learning the dark secret of Antonio Bay.    Seems the town's founders dabbled in a little murder. A ship full of leperous sailors wanted to set up a nearby community of their own but the good folks of Antonio Bay were horrified at the thought and set a trap one foggy night that caused the deaths of the sailors, but not before their leader, Blake, swore revenge.   With this setup told it's a good old-fashioned horror show as the fog creeps slowly towards the shore while a small group townspeople start to clue in that this isn't your run-of-the-mill natural occurance.   John Carpenter's is at the peak of his directoral powers inducing his film with an atmosphere of dread that nicely contrasts the beautiful landscape the film is set in. The veteran emsembled cast are all fine with sexy Adrienne Barbeau standing out as the radio deejay Stevie Wayne who warns the town of the impending danger. Dean Cundey cinematography is one of the film's greatest strengths.   Biggest complaint: Since the ghosts are revenging themselves on the decendants of the six men who planned their deaths, why do the dead sailors try to kill Stevie and her son since they are newcomers to the town.   Dispite this rather obvious loophole in the plot The Fog remains a highly entertaining shocker done by a master director at his best.   This inexpensive DVD comes with everything fans could ask for including a new documentary,the original making-of docu., trailers, outtakes and more.  The movie is remastered in 5.1 as well as it's orignal mono for those purists out there.  There is also a delightful commentary track with John Carpenter and Debra Hill reflecting on the film.  This commentary is now somewhat bittersweet since Debra Hill passed away in March 2005 of cancer while producing the remake of The Fog with Carpenter.
B00005JKDQ|4.0|\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is set in a world looking not unlike our own, only populated by monsters.  Otherwise, and besides the technology that allows its denizens to travel into our world through our closets, \\"Monstropolis\\" looks pretty much like home.  Its people have the same insecurities - fear of the unknown; also everybody is sensitive about an energy crisis, with the dwindling screams of children providing the sole power source for the city.  To secure as much of the scarce energy for Monstropolis (today's children just don't provide screams as easily as in years gone by), Monsters, Inc sends its workers into the bedrooms of children throughout our world in the night's darkest hours collecting the screams needed to keep the city working.  In an unexpected switch, the monsters prove terrified of children, incorrectly believing them to be the most toxic creatures in the universe.  Among the monsters, Sully (voiced by John Goodman) is the champ.  Backed-up by the otherwise hapless Mike Wyzofski (Billy Crystal), Sully barely manages to hold the lead against a slimy and ambitious chameleon named Randall Boggs and voiced by Steve Buscemi.  Among the denizens of Monstropolis, the brave workers of \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" are heroes, up there with the astronauts (their entrance on the factory floor sends up a similar scene from \\"The Right Stuff\\" in which the Mercury astronauts appear in their flightsuits for the press for the first time).  Those monsters who can't make the cut are banished to our world, condemned to making brief cameos on episodes of \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\".  Apparently trying to up his quota, Randall works off-hours.  When one of his victims, an adorable 2 year old girl escapes into the monster world and is discovered by Sully, the company is thrown into a crisis.  Learning that the child (whom they call \\"Boo\\"isn't as dangerous as they'd been led to believe, Sully and Mike protect her from Randall and try to find her door from among the thousands kept in Monsters, inc.'s warehouse, all the time dodging Randall, the insidious stormtroopers of the CDA and a shadowy conspiracy that has plans of its own for Boo.<br />This was a great film, though the characters are pretty one-note (they're all monsters, but their blue-collar sensitivities are very human; Sully is the hero with Mike as the comic relief;  Billy Crystal doesn't get as much mileage from \\"Mike\\" as Tom Hanks or Tim Allen got from Woody and Buzz in the Toy Story movies), but the plot is an ingenious re-working of childhood neuroses (with cowardly monsters who live off our screams replacing toys who live for playing.)  Like other Pixar flicks, even the tape comes with extras - two shorts, one of them being based on \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" characters, plus \\"outtakes\\"  and even shots from a musical version of \\"Monsters, Inc\\" acted and sung by the company's employees.  A lot of fun, without ever being all that scary or sappy.  There's even a high-speed sequence involving Mike, Sully and Boo searching for Boo's door while being chased by Randall, that's bound to show up in Disney as a theme ride.
B00003CXI1|1.0|The books are a beautiful work of art- terribly ruined by this horrible movie. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; has been described as having a new magic that gets kids READING for once, and then what do they do? Make an idiodic movie out of it that leaves out all the good stuff because they only have enough time for the main points. If you really liked the book, do yourself a favor and don't watch the movie, because it messes up how you thought of the book.
B00006AW2L|5.0|Don't get me wrong, the music on this CD is superb (hence the 5 star rating) but when The Rolling Stones and Andrew Loog<BR>Oldham (producer) made these recordings from December 1965-March 1966 and sequenced it for release, THIS is not how they envisioned it. Their authorized version was issued in England on April 15, 1966 with &quot;Paint It, Black&quot; as their current single (issued May 13th) SEPERATE from the album (common UK practice at the time). In North America, it was shoehorned onto AFTERMATH and in its place, &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; was knocked off and put onto the loose ends US-compiled FLOWERS album in mid-1967. In addition, &quot;Out Of Time&quot;, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; &amp; &quot;What To Do&quot; were also taken off, reducing what was a 14-song album to a mere 11.  Buy the UK version. It's what the band intended, and besides, you can hear &quot;Paint It, Black&quot; on FORTY LICKS, HOT ROCKS, THROUGH THE PAST, DARKLY &amp; THE SINGLES COLLECTION. And chances are that you'd already have one of those above mentioned hits collections if you're shopping for their proper studio albums. Hope this helps. :-)
B00005JK8K|5.0|I just bought &quot;Windtalker&quot; and I think it is one of the best war movies to come out of Hollywood. I love war movies and my personal favoret is &quot;Platoon&quot; with Charlie Sheen and William Daefoe but &quot;Windtalkers&quot; is up there with it. Cage is one of the best actors to date and deservese a award of some type for his performance. Marines should love this movie. SEMPER FI.
B00006IUL7|1.0|Insomnia will put you to sleep.  It was awful from beginning to end.  Seeing Al Pacino's name on it made me want to purchase the movie.  I don't rent movies, I only buy.  If this movie had cost me five dollars, that would have been too much.  Everything else Mr. Pacino has been in was terrific but not Imsomnia.  If you want to be bored for two hours or maybe it was more, felt like six hours, then go ahead, watch this movie.  If sleeping pills don't help, watch this movie.
020161622X|5.0|The Pragmatic Programmer is the book all programmers should have to read before they are unleashed onto your source base.<br />The book is nice and terse, covering the ground it needs to cover in little over 250 pages. Clearly the authors are applying the lessons they learnt from Unix, Perl, c++ and a variety of other sources. Rather than wasting words trying to beat home their lessons, the authors have trusted that the reader has some degree of intelligence. They present each nibble of wisdom in a few paragraphs of pithy text which helps to support the 70 tips they provide throughout the book.<br />The book covers a fair degree of ground in it's 258 pages. Testing, documentation, automation and even requirements specifications all get a look in. Most of the book however, is devoted to that part of the art which is harder to define and learn. It is usually learnt from painful experience, or passed on by a senior programmer if you are lucky enough to have one around. It is this knowledge that makes the book worth the read.<br />It's value is not so much that you will find anything revolutionary inside the book, you wont, but that the book provides a terse and approachable font of wisdom for programmers of all skill levels. It is filled with the sort of sensible advice that stops you getting third degree burns while cooking, or cutting your hand off while doing woodshop. Managing to convey that knowledge without sounding preachy or ivory tower in nature adds to it's charm.<br />This book will be required reading for all the programmers on my team at work. It will help them to understand the bigger picture of development, rather than focusing on the minutae of cutting code.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I stumbled on this movie in a rental store, and I was very pleasantly surprised with this adaptation's faithfulness to the book.

B000059HCN|2.0|i bought this movie after friends told me to watch it because it was &quot;my kind of movie&quot;...after reading the reviews here, i decided to buy it because they didn't have it for me to rent at any of the video stores in my area. i really tried to like it, but i didn't. there are many other movies about this subject that make this movie pale in comparison. it's overated..rent it before you buy it if you can
B00005O5JV|4.0|if you're not a brunette or redhead, LEGALLY BLONDE is sweet revenge for all the Dumb Blonde jokes you've ever heard. Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, the president of her Southern California sorority, which seems to consist solely of beautiful but empty-headed coeds. Expecting a marriage proposal from her dreamboat, Rich Boy Warner (Matthew Davis), she is instead dumped. Warner is off to Harvard Law and expects to run for political office someday. As he puts it, \\"I need to marry a Jackie (Kennedy), not a Marilyn (Monroe).\\" Stunned, Elle soon comes to the conclusion that to win him back, she also must get into Harvard Law. Since she has a Fashion Design major, her prospects seem dim. But this is, after all, a Hollywood fable and not real life. The all-male admissions committee grants her entry after viewing her application video, which shows her bikinied in a hot tub. Even lawyers can go \\"oink, oink\\". Anyway, once on campus, Elle is confronted with the usual Dumb Blonde stereotyping. Enraged and indignant, she decides to get serious with her studies. She'll show them!<br />LEGALLY BLONDE is magnificently frivolous with an eminently predictable ending. But, so what? It's also light-hearted and fun, perhaps even to a lawyer. Witherspoon is lovely and perky - a joy to watch. It's family entertainment in which nobody gets permanently hurt. And it's about time that the human subspecies Homo sapiens blondei got empowered. By the way, why did the blonde get so excited after she finished her jigsaw puzzle in only 6 months?
B00005JKDR|5.0|Everything Pixar does is cutting edge.  This is a giant step forward in animation (sp). There are no other contenders in the market place.  Hopefully Disney will continue to co-venture with Pixar to bring the best to the screen.  Surely Disney must know these works are far superior to anything they have independently produced in years.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python at its finest! The anniversary edition is more than worth the price ... the special features are especially fun! I think my favorite is the &quot;Subtitles for people who do not like the film, taken from Henry IV Part II by William Shakespeare.&quot; <br />Of course the Killer Rabbit accountant feature is also funny - if you've ever wanted to make a movie but you don't have the cash, you must needs watch this!

B0000636UN|2.0|Sheryl Crow's latest album is definitely a change, but not for the better.  Even the cover implies something's up.  The new album is definitely upbeat, but it seems that it would appeal more to fans of beach boy or bubblegum pop, rather than her fans from the '90s.  Sheryl might be coping with a midlife crisis by trying to prove that she can be immature, superficial and poppy even though she's now 40.  I bought this CD because I'm a big fan of Sheryl's older music, it was her first album in four years and even though her first single, &quot;soak up the sun&quot; was less than spectacular, critics seemed to be speaking well of the album.  I was disappointed that there wasn't really anything reminiscent of her earlier work and the songs don't really grow on you. Sheryl seems to be playing in a whole other field for now, but hopefully, in time, she'll get back closer to the road she was on.  Although I may want a refund, I'm not assuming that people with all tastes in music will agree with my evaluation of the new Sheryl. You will probably be glad to have this album if you are a fan of artists like Michelle Branch, or any other youngster who lacks real substance, lives on top 40 radio and plays guitar.
B000066JES|3.0|Buy this thing used if you see it.  Odds are you will see it used a lot.  The album is frankly not that good.  It has its moments, the last half is fairly heavy, but the first half is boring.  The tribute to 911 (is bad), a real tribute can be found on Impelliterri's System X cd.  Sorry Manowar.  Karl Logan is no Ross the Boss, there are no themes, no great solos, and the riffs are lacking.  Eric Adams is in fine form, but I would expect more from his bandmates.  It has been 7 years and we get a half metal, half experimentation album.  Perhaps the new tracks on the yet to be single will rock.

You also get wonderful the track \\"Soft Like Me\\", with a great rap intro, jump on the dance floor when \\"Shower Scene\\" starts playing. Other standouts include \\"New Thing\\" and \\"B92\\". I think this album is second only to Tiger Bay. <br />Buy this album, you will not regret it!

So, do your homework.<br />My favorite message, from this book, which I have used as a quote in published articles is, &quot;If you alienate your peeers, you won't have to worry about corporate enemies.&quot;<br />Read this book to balance being yourself, and being a person amongst business people.

0385505833|2.0|since i have read all of grishams other books, i felt obligated to read this one.  i am glad that it wasn;t too long because it seemed less than average in terms of grishams typical style.  i think that he has a knack for writing, but i think he is better in writing the suspenseful type of books rather than the non suspenseful types...<br />this is a pleasant enough story but nothing to write home about or tell others about...(although i guess that is what i am doing?)
0385503954|2.0|I expected much more from this book based on the glowing recommendations. Character development is a hopscotch of scenes with no logical connection, growth, or explanation when characters do an about face in perspective and feelings. Emotional shifts are unexplained. The first section of the book was removed and distant. The story finally captured my attention in the middle section. If it had not been the book selected by my book club, I would have abandoned it within the first 100 pages.

0375414053|1.0|Ever since Bridget Jones hit it big, the publishing industry has been flooding the market with British novels written by young, bright-eyed Brits who are terribly funny and slightly pretentious.  What was original and fun in Bridget Jones is now stale and preachy in I Don't Know How She Does It.<br />Kate Reddy is a working mother who juggles a demanding career in the stock market industry, raising her two young children, and trying to be a good wife to her husband.  The few funny moments of this book are overshadowed by Kate's frenetic pace.  I was literally exhausted just reading this book.  Interwoven with her busy schedule is Kate's - and Allison Pearson's, probably - views on motherhood, children, and husbands.  Perhaps, as a childfree person, I am not the target audience for this one.  I, for one, am slightly offended by the author's implications.  The moral of the story, as far as I could see was: Women are nothing without children and men are nothing without women.  Two gross statements that are so untrue it's not even funny.  I kept on reading this one in hopes of finding one humorous morsel in a book being hyped as the Bridget Jones for the working married woman (now I know why good, old Bridget calls them \\"dull marrieds\\"), but found myself hating each and every one of the characters in this book (except, perhaps, for the man trying to coerce Kate into an affair - the novel would have been decidedly more interesting if she had gone ahead with the affair).  I just didn't care by the end of it, and was thoroughly disgusted with how the novel wrapped up.  Kate, having decided that children are the \\"meaning of life\\", leaves her career and spends her days in her new country home, thinking sad, sympathetic thoughts about her co-worker, Momo, who is \\"terribly naive\\" because she doesn't want children (gasp)!  Take it from me, this book may by the \\"it\\" book of the season, but it's a waste of your money - there are better books out there, and better authors.  I hope Ms. Pearson decides that she is better off raising her children instead of writing.Ms. Pearson decides that she is better off raising her children instead of writing.

B000058DFO|4.0|Syreeta has long been one of my favorite vocalists. When I first heard her on her debut lp, which I bought because of the Stevie Wonder production and knowing of her songwriting with him, I knew she had it. Her crystal, youthful voice is such a joy to hear. The highlights from that lp are heard here- &quot;To Know You..&quot;, &quot;I Love Every Little..&quot; are superb. Here charm carries throughout. EVen the later 'cover' of her co-penned &quot;Seigned, Sealed, Deliviered&quot; is her own.

0930289331|4.0|Funny thing-- I was waiting for a copy of Batman: Dark Knight Returns to arrive in the Philippines for about 3 months now, and today I finally bought one. After all, that book is a certified classic. My buddy Lance lent me his copy about a year ago and it totally changed my view on comics; no, it changed my view of Batman. The story, the art, the whole synergy of comic book lore and human force, all in those crisp pages. Frank Miller has got to be a storytelling powerhouse. I've been obsessing about Dark Knight Returns so much that I had my sister buy it in Amazon two months ago, but decided I just couldn't wait any longer and bought it today.<br />Anyway, right beside DK Returns was a copy of Batman Year One. I was intrigued because I heard about this from my friend who said that he read it and it was good and Darren Aranofsky was set to direct the film version sometime next year. Ok, I got overly curious so I bought the damn thing. In fact, I was halfway out of the mall when I decided, \\"Hey, now's a great time to concentrate on Ol' Bats, why not?\\" So I ran back and got the last copy.<br />I just finished reading Batman Year One. Here's my take: Frank Miller is definitely good. Very unique take on the characters of the comic, i.e. Bruce Wayne's harrowing thirst for justice, Jim Gordon as a true human being, and Gotham City's political and social ennui providing the reader with a relative understanding of the surroundings of Batman. So Year One is a more practical, if not hyperbolical type of comic. On the whole, it's like watching Deep Impact when you could be watching Armageddon. It's the thinking man's Batman. In terms of the storyline, I have to admit there was nothing all too remarkable about Miller's reintroduction of the Dark Knight's origins... Perhaps if we were to talk about Jim Gordon Year One, then this reviewer would be a little more enhtusiastic about it. But hey, I guess we're all human.<br />On the whole, Batman Year One is still a must have for Batman lovers everywhere. I'd still recommend this book to any weary soul tired of having to put up with a Joel Schumacher-inspired slop shop of a Gotham City. This book IS Gotham City, with all its dirty little secrets gaping at you like a fresh wound.

B00003CXXS|3.0|The main reason I like the Jurassic Park movies is because I like dinosaurs. I don't expect much from the story line/plot because the whole purpose of the movies is to show how dangerous dinosaurs would be if they were alive today. So, leave your critical thoughts about plot/story line and watch this movie to see dinosaurs run, fight, chase people, eat people, try to out-think people, etc. Several new dinosaurs are introduced--one of which is bigger and \\"badder\\" than t-rex. An interesting addition is a prop that saves everyones' lives in a direct confrontation with a group of raptors. As the people run from one dinosaur feeding frenzy to another, one can't help but admire the single-minded ferocity of the dinosaurs even as one thinks how silly that some people just scream and scream and never do anything constructive when faced with death. The interest in this film is wondering which dinosaur is going to jump the group next, and the film doesn't disappoint as one dinosaur after another attempts to destroy the group of people invading the dinosaurs' habitat. If you wonder why anyone would return to such a dangerous locale, the film does provide strong motivation for these people to be on the island. If you like to see dinosaurs in action and don't mind everyone except the main characters getting eaten, then you will enjoy this dinosaur-celebrating movie.
B00000J2SO|3.0|I was a big RAINBOW fan in the late 70's and I was quite dis-<br />appointed when I heard RONNIE JAMES DIO had left. Looking back,<br />I really think DIO was at his best with RAINBOW and he also did<br />a great job on BLACK SABBATH/HEAVEN AND HELL and KERRY LIVGRIN'S<br />solo album SEEDS OF CHANGE. I was not very pleased, at first,<br />when I heard DOWN TO EARTH.Even tho' he has a very powerful voice, GRAHAM BONNET seemed to be an odd choice as a replacement<br />for DIO, tho his voice perfectly suited BLACKMORE's more rock-n-<br />roll, commercial music. I was also saddened by the lyrics, which<br />mainly dealt with making love and missing yer woman. The lyrics<br />were penned by bassist ROGER GLOVER, who had recorded the wonder-<br />ful concept album ELEMENTS( which I highly recommend) the year<br />before.<br />  In retrospect, getting rid of DIO and moving away from the<br />medieval lyrics was a smart move by BLACKMORE, as alot of metal<br />bands in the 80'S ( and DIO himself) would make these type of<br />lyrics seem cartoonish. The popularity of DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS,<br />which I never got into but my brothers loved, also didn't help.<br />  As for the album itself, there are some catchy, likable songs<br />here and I now think DOWN TO EARTH is a very good, but not great<br />album. My favorite songs are EYES OF THE WORLD, which is the most<br />progressive song here, has the most dangerous lyrics and also<br />sports a wonderful synthesizer intro by DON AIREY, which is simi-<br />lar to DAVE STONE'S intro for GATES OF BABYLON and TONY CAREY's<br />synth intro for TAROT WOMAN; the RUSS BALLARD cover SINCE YOU'VE<br />BEEN GONE,which has some very typical sad guitar playing from<br />BLACKIE and LOST IN HOLLYWOOD, which has a very fast drum intro<br />from COZY POWELL and which, as a hand drummer, I've never been<br />able to do! LOST is also one of the album's most progressive<br />tunes here. Elsewhere, BONNET sings his powerful lungs out and<br />RAINBOW rock-n-roll their buns off and a good time is had by all.<br /> NOT BAD....y all.<BR> NOT BAD....
0316666343|4.0|Believe the hype-this book is amazing. It really makes you think about heaven and what it may be like. It's almost as if the author was divinely inspired, the way she writes about the afterlife.<BR>Highly recommended!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|i thought this movie was very good. will smith's character seemed a little more dry in this movie than the first but maybe they are just trying to show how working in that business grows on you. i do think it is a movie we can watch over and over again just like the first one.
B00005KARK|5.0|How can ANYONE diss this movie? I first saw it when I was three years old, and I loved it (besides the pink elephant part). I was too young to compare Dumbo getting to made fun of to getting mocked at school for something physical. I just liked the elephants, the voices, and the music. If you show this movie to a young child, they will not know that the mouse and elephant are drinking alcohol. (I believe I thought they were drinking soap water.) I didn't know the crow's voices at the end sounded different for a reason.<br />Hold your kid's hand and let them watch this movie. It'll be good for them.
B00003CXFG|5.0|My friend hated this movie, but he was expecting a horror movie. I love it for the details. The acting isn't perfect, but hey...<br />Ship transporting a whole bunch of not-so-rich people, one rich preson going the scenic route, and one psycho prisoner with guard crashes on the nearest survivable planet after being holed by an asteroid. The planet was once colonized and hasn't been explored since (one gets the feeling space travel & colonization arn't really controlled or coordinated by any single government in this universe). There are aliens, and they arn't really intelligent or friendly.<br />Cool bits? The lighting in the movie has been altered to show that other planets probably would not have a sun with the same visable light spectrum as earth. The aliens don't look like people at all. And there's a good bit where you ... ok, I won't give all the good bits away. But it's really cool. And is has Vin Deisel, acting waaaaay better than in anything else I've seen him in... and looking yummy...
B000002KKX|5.0|Christopher Cross had a relatively brief but spectacular career in the early 80's, and his debut stands as his most successful CD.  It yielded a classic #1 adult contemporary ballad - \\"Sailing\\" (which was later remade by 'n sync!), which is a truly beautiful song.  The other big hit (#2 for 4 weeks) was \\"Ride Like the Wind,\\" which is more uptempo, but still mellow.  A couple of other songs also made the Top 20 - \\"Never Be the Same\\" and \\"Say You'll Be Mine.\\"  The CD is very poppy and flows so well together.  I originally bought the cassette when I was 12-years-old, and I replaced it on CD a few years ago.  Highly recommended.  This CD will appeal most to fans of mellow pop music, but it really is just great music.
0345446798|5.0|If you only buy one new book, make it this one. Patricia McConnell opens your eyes to a whole new perspective on the dog/human relationship - one based on a real understanding of the differences between canine and primate (human) thinking and body language. This is not a dog training book, but your training and relationship with your dog - with ALL dogs - will be hugely enhanced by this compelling read. Buy it!!
B00006HBUB|3.0|I watched this movie with my little brother last night.  Needless to say, he has watched it again since then.  What I'm trying to say is that if you are not an eleven year old boy this movie might not be your style.  Yet, I still have to admit that even I did laugh at the farting and burping jokes a bit.  I guess I liked the old cartoons better where there always was a logical answer to each mystery.  It gave you a chance to think.  The parts of Shaggy and Velma were the two best actors in the movie.  I also loved the animated Scooby.  So, if you are looking for an exact replica of the old cartoons, I would not reccomend this movie.  But if you are looking for a cute, funny movie that is appropriate to watch with you family I say go for it!
B000002HAF|5.0|Surfer Rosa, while not as musically intricate or well-constructed as later releases, leaps out of the speakers with a certain urgent and excited energy that the Pixies would never match.  Everything sounds so uncontrolled and immediate, as if it came flowingly and naturally.  From the upbeat fun of &quot;Bone Machine&quot;, to the balls-to-the-wall pop of &quot;Gigantic&quot;, to the raucous verbal assaults in Spanish of &quot;Oh My Golly&quot;, each song on Surfer Rosa has its own distinct flavor and personality.  Kim Deal's angelic voice weaves beautifully with Black Francis' piercing nasal wail.  Joey Santiago is a quintessential pop guitarist; rather than merely following the chords and vocals, what he plays is its own entity, such as the colorful melodic hook of &quot;Where is My Mind?&quot;, or the bluesish meanderings of &quot;Brick is Red&quot;.  Surfer Rosa makes for a very satisfying listening experience.
B00005OAIE|1.0|My wife got me this cd for my birthday because she liked what she heard. Though my wife and I don't always agree when it comes to musical taste I was mildly excited. Well...how can I say this without sounding like my wife wasted fifteen bucks and I wished I had every cent back so tat I coud select another cd. Okay, here it goes (hope I don't sound bitter): This cd is CRAP!!! For some reason, maybe its the boyish good-looks but I can't help thinking of Shawn (Sean? Shaun? Who cares) Cassidy when I see this guy and his music did nothing to shake that awful image. I found myself singing Da Doo Run, Run in the shower the next morning. Unluckily, I consider throwing away a cd a mortal sin Luckily, shelving a cd for its mortal life I do not. Here's to Mayer never putting out another cd again. Cheers!
B000003TAB|4.0|In late 1992 Nirvana's label released this collection of B-sides and unreleased songs, in an effort to both satisfy the public's craving for Nirvana and to distract people from all the negative press regarding Kurt's drug use.  For a compilation album, this disc's material is pretty strong, but it doesn't get the full 5 stars because it doesn't represent all aspects of Nirvana's sound.  Nevertheless, it is essential for any fan.<BR>            Incesticide is a bit of a schizophrenic album, with two dramatically different sides.  The first side, tracks 1-8, chronicle's the bands evolution from the punked-up metal seen on Bleach to the jaw-dropping pop rock of Nevermind.  \\"Sliver\\" and \\"Been a Son\\" are unabashedly catchy pop songs, while \\"Dive\\" combines a heavy guitar riff, tormented yet slightly subdued screams, and nascent pop melodies.  There are two Vaselines' covers, including the two-chord wonder \\"Molly's Lips\\" and the upbeat \\"Son of a Gun\\", as well as an entertaining version of the Devo song \\"Turnaround\\". <BR>            The second side, tracks 9-15, can be viewed as a manifestation of all that is crazed, bizarre, and dark about Nirvana.  Songs 9-13 are all taken from the band's first demo tape, and show a certain maturity and unique approach to songwriting for such a young band.  \\"Beeswax\\" and \\"Downer\\" are angry and dark, with indecipherable lyrics. \\"Mexican Seafood\\" is an aggressive punk number, with lyrics that were likely ... Surfers-inspired, while \\"Hairspray Queen\\" sounds like the Gang of Four on speed.  \\"Aero Zeppelin\\" boasts an intricate arrangement, with wild dynamics, tempo changes, metallic riffs, and a fiery Zeppelin-styled solo.  Song 14, the eerie and ponderous \\"Big Long Now\\", was taken from the Bleach sessions.  The last song, the mighty \\"Aneurysm\\", is an anomaly for the album.  When Incesticide was released \\"Aneurysm\\" was the most recently recorded song.  Yet the song fits in more with the angry, heavy songs from the bands earlier days, hinting that Nirvana would be heading for darker territory on their next record, which they did.<BR>            Incesticide, even though not a \\"real\\" album, is full of excellent material; many of the songs could have been included on actual releases.  However, Nirvana other facets to their sound, such as the wonderful acoustic cover of VU's \\"Here She Comes Now\\", and the metallic thunder of \\"Pen Cap Chew\\".  It still deserves 4 stars, because most of the material that WAS included is excellent.
0380820846|3.0|In this installment to the series, Lady Whistledowne is finally revealed, but to be honest, I had it figured it by the last Quinn novel. Like Ms.Quinn's other novels, I fully enjoyed the witty dialogue that attempts to be in the vein of the historical time period these books take place. <br />In this novel, Colin Bridgerton is the handsome Bridgerton brother who wants to be seen as a unique individual and not just as one of his many brothers.Penelope Featherington has been a wallflower all her life, and her secret writing has been giving her otherwise dull life some pleasure and purpose. However, upon discovering Penelope's secret, Colin is at first horrified, and then later becomes her champion. In return, Penelope gives him the courage to display some of his own talents that set him apart from his family. The love story is a bit weak, as Colin seems to fall in love quite quickly with a woman he never was attracted to in the past, and really didn't skim too deeply under the surface of Penelope until later in the novel. Nevertheless, it was a sweet love story.<br />I only gave this book three stars because the ending seemed ridiculously far-fetched and almost laughable. It seems the Bridgerton's can do no wrong, and can turn any unpleasant revelation into a triumph. The whole ending felt very contrived regarding the unmasking of Lady Whistledowne, and totally out of character with the time period, which is usually Ms. Quinn's better writing traits. In fact, I had the same problem with her last novel, &quot;An Offer From a Gentleman&quot;. In a setting where every social faux pas and geneology is so meticulous (shallow but true), it seems you can get away with anything as a Bridgerton and nobody seems to care. Ms.Quinn has real potential, but the unrealistic endings of her latest books have taken it down a notch.  There is nothing wrong with the main characters having a happy ending, but she doesn't need to re-invent Victorian society so these characters are suddenlysocially acceptable by all.  However, some readers like it neatly tied up with a ribbon and a bow, and if you are one of them, you'll enjoy this book more than I did.
B000005S31|4.0|This is probably Reed's most atypical solo album and at first sounds lightweight and subdued, laking the great moments, drama and exciting highlights of his best work. Hard to appreciate immediately, repeated listens reveal Coney Island Baby's lyrical depth and melodic beauty. My favorites include the love song She's My Best Friend, the streetwise Charley's Girl and the sensitive narrative of the title track. Not his greatest album, but valuable as a showcase of Reed's human side in its warmth and simplicity.
6305736650|5.0|It's hard to believe that when Casablanca was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in 1942 it was &quot;just another&quot; of the 50 or so films that the studio was producing every year, as Lauren Bacall points out in the documentary about the film included in the special features. The movie was an instant success with audiences everywhere, and won three Academy Awards including Best Picture. Called &quot;America's most popular and beloved movie- and rightly so&quot; by The Motion Picture Guide, and &quot;The best Hollywood movie of all time&quot; by Leonard Maltin, Casablanca was  voted the #2 film in a list of the top 100 films of this century by the American Film Institute.<BR>  Set in refugee strewn French North Africa in 1942, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), a night club owner, and his friend Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains), Prefect of Police, enter into a wager as to whether or not Resistance Leader Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid) will be able to escape Casablanca and reach the Free World. When Laslo arrives in Casablanca, Rick is stunned to find him accompanied by his ex-lover, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Filled with mystery, suspense, intrigue and romance, Casablanca will remain a favorite of classic movie lovers for years to come.<BR>  The supporting cast include Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson as Rick's piano playing confidant, Sam. The entire cast are superb, the settings are excellent, and the cinematogrophy is wonderful.<BR>  The song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; was made famous by Casablanca, as it's melody is entwined throughout the film, and it too is now a classic, filled with romance and nostalgia.<BR>  This is one film that absolutely MUST be in your DVD library!
B000001FFJ|5.0|Rain Dogs epitomizes, think-throated, eccentric singer/songwriter, Tom Waits' ability to absorb any musical styling or seemingly random amalgamation of stylings and from it produce something uncannily wild.  This excellent 1985 album is a cycle of mummbly, sad luck-country (\\"Time,\\" \\"Blind Love\\"), explosive blues growlers (\\"Union Square,\\" \\"Big Black Mariah\\"), ghostly night-folk (\\"Clap Hands,\\" \\"Gun Street Girl\\"), and miscellaneous (\\"Anywhere I Lay My Head,\\" \\"Singapore\\"). Throughout this absolute trip of an album, there is never a moment that seems at all forced or exaggeratedly artsy. It sounds as if spectacles such as the shaky wordplay and broken-keyboard twinkling of \\"9th and Hennepin\\" and horn-section jumble of the instrumental, \\"Midtown\\" are perfectly customary in the warped world of Mr. Tom Waits. Rain Dogs displays one of music's most astonishing mad geniuses at the height of his power.
B00005JH9W|5.0|One of the most bizarre and original shockers ever made. This film lingers in your memory long after you've seen it. Tod Browning created this horror masterpiece using real physically handicapped oddities or \\"freaks\\" as characters alongside the \\"normal\\" actors in a circus sideshow story. Absolutely amazing every time you watch it and every bit as disturbing as it was in 1932. The story of a trapeze artist who marries a sideshow midget for his money and then humiliates him in front his friends is still uncomfortable. Of course the final revenge on the trapeze star is revolting but the way the \\"freaks\\" stalk her prior to the attack is one of the scariest scenes ever committed to film. This classic needs to be preserved on DVD badly. An absolute MUST for anyone who hasn't seen it.
B000001FTJ|4.0|After spending the first decade of his career partially in the realm of normalcy, 1983's Swordfishtrombones, features think-throated singer/songwriter, Tom Waits, engineering a style that has to be experienced to be believed. Acid rock-ish twinkling, vaporous blues riffs, Captain Beefheart-style wackiness and sounds that could have only come from a minstrel show from Mars all mix with Mr. Waits' abrasive grunts and brutal growls for an entirely unadulterated and truly distinctive disc. His expanded sense of musical experimentation does not hinder Mr. Waits' ability to write solid songs (One could argue that it strengthens it). Swordfishtrombones contains some of his best-written tunes such as the bluesy rollicker, \\"Down Down Down,\\" the wry monologue, \\"Frank's Wild Years,\\" the somber, grumbling \\"Town With No Cheer\\" and its flipside, the sumptuous tribute to small-time life, \\"In the Neighborhood,\\" all of which are as vividly worded song-poems as one could ask. Swordfishtrombones is undoubtedly one of the definitive Tom Waits albums.
B000002UAC|4.0|I have Meet the Beatles and the first songs are: I Wanna Hold Your Hand and When I Saw Her Standing There. Neither of those are even on the WITH album. I have to believe this is different from the Meet the Beatles album.
B00005Y7OJ|4.0|As I've found a lot of today's radio listening as being boring, I've gone back in time to fill in certain gaps of musical plentitude.  Bilingual by the Pet Shop Boys was released in the fall of 1996 while I was working on a movie with Latin based themes; I thought what better to score those daily task than with Latin influenced music. Thus daily spins of Bilingual became commonplace. Tracks Discoteca, Single, Metamorphosis, Se a Vida e', To Step Aside are multicultural amalgamations of heat, rhythm, style, substance, and movement. We're talking disco beats, Latin percussion, cocktail jazz, nuance vocals, and innuendo lyrics aplenty. The upbeat, up-tempo material presented here in all sunny yellow overtones speaks of equatorial holiday - fun in the sun. To stay the mainsail, Up Against It, Red Letter Day, Saturday Night Forever shore up what becomes one of the Pet Shop Boys more adventurous musical odysseys. The real crown jewel on this album is Before. Possibly one of the most beautiful love ballads written by Tennant and Lowe, this song is masterfully crafted, with the perfect accompaniment on guitar by the always-prodigy, Johnny Marr. In no way should this album be taken lightly since the nature of the music and disposition is. Don't be fooled, overtones, undercurrents, hidden layers, depth of field and vision help make Bilingual a stunning musical achievement. . I've often read where some think this is their one off album. I beg to differ. Even on a bad day, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe are songwriters nonpareil. Giants among mere mortals, the musical moments and compositions on Bilingual shine brightly, complete in themselves. Justification and acknowledgement needed from none.

B000003CUJ|5.0|Mention Richard Wagner and many people's eyes will glaze over, or visions of interminable operas with large women with spears singing will pop into someone's head. But this does a disservice to Wagner, and to the listener - for Wagner wrote some very beautiful orchestral music to bridge between his operatic heroes and heroines singing. Wagner's Ring cycle is probably one of the greatest collections of composition in the world. But who has the time and patience to put in 15+ hours to listen to it? That's where this CD comes in - it's the cliff notes version of the opera - showing you the brilliance of Wagner's operas for the music, not the \\"singing.\\" Music ranges from the light and lilting Forest Murmurs, to the heavy sorrow of Siegfried's Death and Funeral Music, to the instantly familiar Ride of the Valkyries. While so much attention has been paid to certain singers of certain productions of the Ring, this cuts through all of that to the fundamental orchestral music. A good recording, with nuanced performances and strong commitment to providing the best music possible, this is a great way for the listener to cut his or her teeth on Wagner, or to put just enough of a toe in the pool to find out that the water's fine.
B000002U82|5.0|Every Pink Floyd fan is probably tired of hearing three things: The Wall, Wish You Were Here and The Dark Side of the Moon. I don't share most opinions on those matters: fans will tell you The Wall isn't a great album, they will tell you Wish You Were Here was a comercial disc. But, luckily, they've been able to seen beyond this snobism and they are able to admit the greatness achieved by Dark Side of the Moon. A greatness imposible to denie. A greatness achieved through three things: incredible and hipnotic music, a concept treated in depth and, more important, with sincerity, and a union of both in most beautiful balance, never rushing, but leading inevitably towards the great culmination: this is art, this is Pink Floyd. A perfectly balanced complicated art, a spiderweb of darkness and truth.<BR>If you like other albums by Pink Floyd, this is the one you should have and god knows why you don't have it yet and you're reading a review to make a decission. Music and lyrics not only reach the highest point in the history of the band, but also work togheter like never before and never after, uniting in one with perfect harmony. Waters writes about madness, but not medical madness, the madness of common people, a madness almost imposible to escape. A man runs and goes mad trying to run away from his dark side, but is inevitably reached by it. And that's what we hear implicit in the music. And that's what the Dark Side is all about, madness. The album starts with a slow paced breathtaking composition, Breathe, to continue with  three of the greatest PF songs, Time, A great Gig in the Sky (with that incredible voice, Claire Torry's, shouting from the dark side) and Money. Us and them is also a peaceful song, like most of the album, acompaning perfectly the spirit of the song. After that, the albums starts going towards the inevitable end, with Brain Damage and Eclipse in the end resolving the whole problem: &quot;there is no dark side of the moon, really. Matter of factit's all dark&quot;.

0060254920|5.0|The moment I found out I was going to be an aunt, I went out & purchased this book straight away.  This book is essential to any child's collection.  I enjoyed this book when I was little & gave it to my nephew the wonderful day he came into this world.  See, I'm a bit of a \\"wild thing\\" myself, but find nothing wrong with that.  The inscription I wrote was something along these lines (& hopefully this gives a little insight into the book as well):  \\"To my dear little nephew.  No matter how many places you go, no matter how much of a wild thing you become, please remember that you can always come home to find a glass of milk and someone who loves you.\\"
B00005NWM3|5.0|I purchased this cd because I really liked How You Remind Me, and wound up loving it!  I was stunned by how gritty and great it is.  The song Never Again is in my opinion the best on the cd--it is so full of pent up rage directed at spousal abuse.  It's a serious song about a serious topic and although I don't support violence as an answer to violence, I still can't help but feel good for the abused wife when she puts an end to it all.  It makes you feel outraged about the situation of battered wives and want to DO something positive about it.  In this day and age of &quot;rubber stamped&quot; boy bands and meaningless music it is a rare talent to actually make you think and feel about what you're listening to.  The rest of the cd is great and well worth checking out.  Sometimes you just need to let the demons out and listen to something angry and this is it.
0440211727|3.0|The gripping suspense through out the book kept you turning. After reading most of the book, I realized that I had yet to come upon the conclusion. &quot;Why&quot; you ask? Well the last 15 pages were the conclusion. The verdict, his wife, Lucien, his law clerk was all answered in these 15 pages but left many holes! I wanted to hear how Carl Lee lived his life, what his wife's reaction was about her house, and what ever happaned to Row Ark! Yes we all know that she was in the hospital with her father by her side, but what now? Overall, for a first novel of a successful auther, the book was awesome. I just wish the conclusion would have been longer to fill in the gaps.
B000066I6N|5.0|A totally emmersed Zep/Page/Plant fan with every album to boot, I was curious what suprises may lie ahead with Dreamland. I was pleasantly surprised. While Robbie Blunt's guitar totally embodied Robert's {sweet}, sultry voice in \\"Big Log\\" (my absolute favorite tune), Porl Thompson seemed to take Robbie's place with Robert's quieter moments with just enough reverb to make it flow like water, listen to \\"Win my train fare home\\". These are the tunes Robert has always loved, you can feel the emotion. You wont hear but a faint idea of Led Zeppelin in this album, so if this is what you are expecting, you would be better served popping \\"Physical Graffiti\\" in and hit play. Robert is not about keeping an even keel, he likes to change and move where the mood takes him, which seems to be always interesting. Dreamland is an effort not quite like I have ever heard, but it does have its place. Like the very simple photos in the album jacket, these are just a bunch of guys that want to play and play well....they do. Like fine wine, Robert gets better with age.

B000068TSI|5.0|This will most certianly go down as a classic movie and as a movie with class.  First of all it combines the surberb acting talent of Mel Gibson AND Sam Elliot!.  Second of all, this is one of if not the very first to show the extreme sturggles on the home front.  What some of the other reviewers describe as fluff, cheese, and boring, is pure emotion.  Just imagine if you got word that your loved one was killed, all of a sudden those \\"fluff\\" parts become incredibly powerful and emotional.<BR>    War is hell, so simple yet so true. I feel that Randall Wallace succeeded with flying colors in bringing our the hellish nature of war.  Colonel Moore said it perfectly, \\"'cause when [the fighting] starts ourselves is all we got.\\"  Randall Wallace then successfully showed the interpersonal relatinships between all who fought together.  <BR>     We were Soldiers will go down as perhaps the greatest war movie ever made and should surely break into the top 15 movies of all time.  The power will make itself trully known in the last 30 minutes, especially when you find yourself still watching the credits, mesmorized to the score, minutes after the movie ended.  You will most certianly gain a new understanding towards the ordinary soldier.  <br />\\"To fallen soldiers let us sing<BR>Where no rockets fly nor bullets wing<BR>Our broken brothers let us bring<BR>To the Mansions of the Lord\\"

B000059HAI|3.0|There's no denying the grand effort that went into making this historical presentation of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Taking accounts of both sides of the war equally, made respectively by both United States and Japanese production crews, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great documentation of how the attack really occurred. Unlike the recent Pearl Harbor film, which tries to tell the historical story (with many flaws), a love story and a disaster story, Tora! Tora! Tora knows what is meant to be, and strictly follows the historical angle.<br />Unfortunately, this dedication to fact is the films major weakness. There are no real characterizations of any of the major roles, no central character the audience can connect with, either on the American or Japanese forces. This lack of a so called staring role (which both sides should have had) makes the film feel more like a documentary then a movie. What characters the film does center on are all flat and rather uninteresting. Not to mention poorly acted.<br />Despite this, the film provides a great understanding of how the attack really occurred, and gives a wonderful visual feast of the disaster. For 1970, when this film was released, the visual effects are outstanding. Definitely worth at least one viewing, more if you're a World War II buff.

0792101448|5.0|If A Fistful of Dollars served as Sergio Leone's witty and frenetic deconstruction (and resurrection) of the American Western, then Once Upon a Time in the West is his self-apotheosis, a transcendence of the old Western's limitations and a simultaneous summation of a new tradition. There is simply no better opening in any Western than Leone's languorous story-within-a-story, as three gunslingers patiently wait for the arrival of the train that will literally become the central vehicle of the film's metaphoric and mythic investigation of the coming of modern capitalism. Through it, Leone is sending an unmistakable message to his audience: this is a film that divulges its narrative only on its own terms and timetable; viewers expecting anything straightforward or clear-cut would do better to search out a Corbucci Western. <br />As in his two preceding films, Leone structures his story around a disparate group of men (uneasily) united by a shared quest. But whereas the object of desire in his earlier efforts took the form of money (bounty in For a Few Dollars More; gold in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly), here it is displaced onto the central figure of a woman: Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale, with a dubbed voice). This is Leone's brilliant answer to his own complaint about the role of women in American Westerns--that they are always just hazards or impediments to the male heroes, objects that must be avoided or won. Thus, they are never individuals--merely necessary figures in a conventional narrative. But Jill McBain serves simultaneously as the object of desire and an initiator of her own narrative (one that brings about the close of each of the males' narratives). On one level, Jill (like the gold in the other films) is a symbol of the men's needs, a displaced object of desire: for Harmonica (Charles Bronson), she is a tool of vengeance in his quest to confront Frank; for Frank (Henry Fonda), she is a ticket out of gunfighting and into a world of true capitalist wealth; for Cheyenne (Jason Robards), she is a figure to protect, a reminder of his lost mother; and for Mr. Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) she is an impediment to progress that must be removed at all costs. Of course, to their collective surprise, Jill McBain has her own desires--and the existence of such desires is what subverts the conventional passive role of women in Westerns. In a sense, she represents the inevitability of change--the bittersweet hope of a future. <br />Many factors beyond Leone's direction make Once Upon a Time in the West a truly rewarding experience for the viewer: Tonino Delli Colli's exquisite photography, Ennio Morricone's haunting score (perhaps his greatest ever), Henry Fonda's unforgettable turn as a cold-blooded killer, and perhaps the most mythic screenplay ever written for a Western (a colloboration including Bernardo Bertolucci, Dario Argento, and Sergio Dontai with Leone). A courageous and flawless masterpiece-and perhaps one of the best films of all time.<br />Postscript: If you can find a copy of the newly remastered DVD of \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" it's well worth your viewing.  The opening sequence is restored to its FULL length (even longer than the \\"restored\\" American version), and several scenes in the film are also slightly lengthened.  Of course, the version is only in Italian, without subtitles, and can generally only be found via an Ebay or Marketplace seller, unless you're willing to buy it direct from an Italian distributor.  But it's the only DVD version on the market today.
B000066NW0|1.0|This CD is terrible.  I wish Amazon.com could let me give this zero stars.  This slick sounding pop record is what is wrong with music today.  The people who had a hand in getting this on a record label and out to the masses all have seats waiting for them in hell.<br />Terrible people, this is terrible.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|So many \\"family films\\" are hokey, clichéd tripe, recycling the same ideas used countless times before. The end product, while something new and interesting for children, lacks any true enjoyment for film-savvy adults. But then there's E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, a family film that both children and adults can embrace.<br />The story is a simple one of friendship, but one spanning light years. When Elliott meets a stranded alien, he takes it in under his roof secretly, building an incredible bond with the creature. Of course the synopsis sounds cheesy, but it's done with such grace, dignity and beauty by director Steven Spielberg that it transcends any hokey elements, becoming a completely believable and powerful film of love, friendship and family. Who said kids movies are just for kids.<br />I loved this film as a child, but hadn't seen it for many years until the DVD release. I figured it wouldn't be as magical as it was, like most movies I loved in my youth. But I was surprised at how I loved this movie even more as an adult, understanding more of the meaning behind the film. This is a movie that only improves with age, and one I know I will always love. To use a comment Spielberg made about another film, it uses the greatest special effect possible: emotion.<br />The recent update to the film, with added special effects and scenes does have some good new moments, but the CGI effects are distracting, and the Politically Correct moves by Spielberg to remove guns and the word \\"Terrorist\\" are unfortunate. Stick with the original for repeat viewings. All the magic is there, and will be for eternity.
B00006AFUR|4.0|30 Seconds to Mars aren't going to turn the music world on it's ear, but they'll pour a nice digital poison into it. The music is nicely layred and offers every spectrum of emotion, and then some. It's nice to listen to a new band that has some craetive and thoughtfull lyrics. It's hard to put them in a solid category, but I'd have to say that if you're a fan of Linkin Park, Cold, Finger Eleven, Tool, Project Pitchfork, then check them out.  If not...just go listen to <PIG> or Velvet Acid Christ.
B00000DCHI|5.0|If you already own the previous non-remastered bulky \\"double-clamshell\\" version of this 2-disc set from 1985 and have wondered if it would really be worth it to upgrade to the remastered version from 1998, here's some things to think about:<br />Six songs that were released in edited versions on the previous edition have now been restored to their full original studio album lengths.  They are (along with old/new running time) - \\"The Stranger\\" (4:55/5:09), \\"Just The Way You Are\\" (3:34/4:51), \\"My Life\\" (3:50/4:44), \\"Big Shot\\" (3:43/4:02), \\"She's Got A Way\\" (2:44/3:02), \\"Pressure\\" (3:13/4:37)<br />\\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" is now the original 1976 version from \\"Turnstiles\\".  On the previous edition, it was the live version from 1981's \\"Songs In The Attic\\".  The 1981 version became a Top 20 hit, so if you favor that one, you may want to hang on to your old non-remastered GHVI&II.  I probably prefer the live version simply because I'm more familiar with it and it seems to have more energy than the original, but that alone wasn't enough to keep me from parting with my old GHVI&II.<br />The bonus multimedia material included is pretty much the same kind of superfluous window dressing found on other discs of this nature - discographies, album covers, etc., all of which of course can be readily found on the Internet (if you didn't know that, you wouldn't be reading this right now, right?).  It does however, contain the videos for the two \\"new\\" songs on this record, \\"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\\" and \\"The Night Is Still Young\\".  \\"You're Only Human\\" is actually a very good video for an otherwise so-so song, with Billy playing the angel role in yet another spin on \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\".  However, one still kind of wishes they'd left off all this stuff and just used the space to add a couple more well-known songs like \\"Honesty\\", \\"Prelude/Angry Young Man\\", \\"Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway)\\", \\"Sometimes A Fantasy\\", or \\"Leave A Tender Moment Alone\\".  <br />Andof course, the remastered sound is excellent (acoustic/piano-based acts like Billy Joel benefit greatly from remastering), and the packaging is an improvement over the former version.  For me, the extended versions of the songs alone are worth the upgrade, but consider all of the information presented here and make your own best judgement!
B00006J3WH|5.0|I absolutely loved this CD, as does my husband and three boys ranging from 18 months old to 6 years old (my husband and I are nearing 30).  We all love the show and my children have watched every episode since they were born.  And now they can enjoy it in the car as well.  Whenever we are in the car together we all sing along (with us each singing for a different person) and mimiking some of the moves (the kids especially like &quot;dancing crazy&quot; like Anya did in the episode).  My youngest son's first sentence was a section of &quot;Going Through the Motions&quot;. Anyone who is a true BTVS fan will enjoy this refreshing CD.
B00005QJDG|5.0|You definitely need to order this album if you are a new fan of Dream Theater.  A lot of the songs by 'Dream Theater' in this album are very spectacular, like 'The Spirit Carries On' and 'A Change of Seasons'-- they're are enjoyable to hear to.  A genre combined with hard rock, and phenomenal ballads make this album a worthy successor.  And it's worth the money, since you also get three live, complete songs by 'Dream Theater' to view on the computer.  <br />You'll be impressed.
0767817478|4.0|That's right - this film isn't a classic, and it was never meant to be. View this as a high-tech, modern day version of the 1950's sci-fi productions and you will not be disappointed. The cheesy dialogue, simple minded plot and wooden performances fit right in with that genre. So sit back, grab some popcorn and a beer, and enjoy the show!

0375414053|5.0|\\"I Don't Know How She Does It,\\" by Allison Pearson, has gotten a lot of advance buzz.  It captures perfectly the whine of the modern, high-powered executive (female) who wants to have it all.  What she ends up with is guilt, exhaustion, and low self-esteem.<br />Kate Reddy, the British protagonist of this trendy novel, seems to be the perfect role model.  She is a thirty-something mother with two adorable children, a loving husband, and a high-paying job as a hedge-fund manager.  She is a high-flyer in a male-dominated world.  No one knows how Kate manages to juggle all of her responsibilities, which include frequent business trips. The answer is, she can't.  Kate's kids, Emily and Ben, miss their mother terribly during her frequent absences.  Her husband, Rich, feels neglected and somewhat emasculated by Kate's tactless pronouncement that she is the \\"main breadwinner\\" in the family.<br />Pearson captures Kate's life perfectly and with great wit.  We experience Kate's exasperation when her nanny cancels at the last minute or when Kate's mother-in-law tells her pointedly that she had better start paying attention to her man.  Kate lurches from crisis to crisis, sending desperate and confessional emails to her girlfriends as a way to vent and ease her nervous tension.  We feel her pain, but we also suspect that she may eventually pay the price for her self-delusion.<br />Can Kate continue to balance work and family indefinitely, without losing her mind?  Will she succumb to the charms of a gorgeous male client who wants more from her than just business advice?  Will Rich finally force Kate to choose between him and her job?  Pearson manages to tackle all these questions with poignancy, humor and wisdom.  Her breezy writing style is a delight and I recommend that you sit back and enjoy this entertaining book by a very talented author.
B000002HK4|5.0|I remember when my older brother played this song a few times, I never thought to ask him what the name of the song was, but whatever that song was, it was phenomenal.  Ofcourse, later on, I found out that that song was called 'A Change of Seasons';  one of the songs that makes this album stand out beautifully.  And the others are worth listening too.  <br />'A Change of Seasons': A song this long, with many varied sounds, and some masterful voices and I mean opera-like voices, makes you play at least more than 4 times a day.  The lyrics are profound, with some twists in it.  This song is like a poem--very descriptive, very dynamic.  <BR>5/5<br />The above song is one of my favorite songs of this group.  All of the rest of the songs in 'A Change of Seasons' are excellent songs, since these are some of the tributes to some of the very popular artists.  <br />I found this album very illustrious and vigorous and so will you.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I've always had a certain respect for Beck.  With Odelay and Midnight Vultures in my music collection, I have always thought of him as an interesting and innovative artist.<br />One day I was on the internet and decided to check out Beck's website to see what he was up to, and I ended up finding out he was due to release an album called Sea Change.  They had a song sample of &quot;The Golden Age&quot; available, so I decided to have a listen.  I was blown away by how different his sound was compared to what everyone was used to.<br />I bought the cd on the day of it's release, and I must admit, at first listen I wasn't pleased.  Although it sounded great, I kept thinking of it as &quot;Beck goes Mellow &amp; Acoustic.&quot;  As soon as I abandoned that view, I fell in love with the album.  With Nigel Godrich at his side, Beck has gone beyond just making music and has made an album with atmosphere.  WARNING: Not for the musically frigid!<br />It is definitely one of the best albums of 2002.
B0000542D2|1.0|it should have no stars at all for this re-released dvd. It looks good but sounds terrible, moreover this re-released was recorded in mono only. The whole songs sounding very weak. I guess it was digitally remastered but in fact it wasnt! <BR>die hard fans must be happy with it!
B00005JK8K|3.0|John Woo knows action.  Just check his directorial resume to find some of the most explosively imaginative films to hit American theaters.  John Woo struggles a bit with emotions that don't culminate in a roundhouse punch or bazooka blast.  While \\"Windtalkers\\" has plenty of each, the heart of the story holds a good deal of untapped drama that would have vaulted this film from good to fantastic.<br />A recent WWII-era of note, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", had some grimly realistic (and let's face it, eye-popping) battle scenes, but what really drew the audience in was the humanity of the small troop accomplishing something heroic.  In contrast, \\"Windtalkers\\" somehow misses the mark of making the audience walk a mile in its characters' shoes.  The well casted crew creates an adequate atmosphere, but the script kept them more-or-less in caricature-mode.  With his keen facial inflections, Nicolas Cage imbues depth to a rather flatly written part, but again, he wasn't given much to work with.<br />The battle scenes are impressive, but after the third Rambo-esque shoot-em-up session (one man, one machine-gun, lots of dead bad-guys), you might start to think, \\"I've seen this before.\\"  John Woo didn't seem to tap his full creative \\"action\\" reserve here, even during the armed conflicts.  Many fans have grown to hold pretty high expectations for Mr. Woo, and until now, he's always delivered above-and-beyond.  In the case of \\"Windtalkers\\" action sequences, the word \\"adequate\\" comes mind.<br />After the film was finished, I felt only partially satisfied.  While the movie is entertaining, the code talkers are ultimately peripheral players in the Cage character's struggle.  I wasn't hoping for a documentary on Navajo Code Talkers, but more focus on them in a movie about them would have been more fulfilling.<br />Note on the DVD:  the \\"extras\\" on my version are nearly nonexistent.  They include two trailers for \\"Windtalkers\\", a trailer for another film, and text credits for the DVD production crew.  For a historically based film, the least they could have added was a short PBS-esque documentary on actual code talkers.  Something... Anything would have been nice.uction crew.

0316666343|3.0|First of all I would like to say that I think Ms. Sebold is an excellent writer as far as writing goes, but her story was just a bit too farfetched to suit me.  The thought of our dead loved ones spying on our every move after death was a little chilling and a tad over the top I thought.  Will I read another book by this writer?  You bet I will, I think Ms. Sebold has a lot of talent.
B00006AW2M|3.0|A misguided attempt to stay \\"hip\\", Satanic Majesties reflected the Stones moving into Summer of Love territory a bit late and with material weaker than on the previous three albums. That's not to say that Satanic Majesties doesn't have its charms. She's a Rainbow and 2000 Light Years from Home both are classic Stones material remolded into psychedelic anthems. Bill Wyman's single songwriting contribution (outside of group compositions)is In Another Land. It's also fairly solid although Wyman's inexperience as a lead vocalist shows.<br /><br />There's many embarrassing moments in the Stones catalog but, really, Satanic Majesties isn't one of them. It was timely (or seemed to be) when it was released but, like Sgt. Pepper, has lost some of its luster. Pepper hasn't aged as well as other albums in the Beatles catalog but has aged better than Satanic Majesties.<br /><br />The Stones would find their way once again with the shattering one-two punch of Beggar's Banquet (The Beatles returned to their roots with the White Album around the same time. Ironic that both had fairly plain white coveers given the extreme nature of their previous releases)and Let It Bleed. Both albums are gems in the Stones catalog that have aged like fine wine. BB has withstood the test of time slightly better than Let It Bleed (there are a couple of tracks like Monkey Man and Midnight Rambler that, despite their solid performances, are filler)<br /><br />I'm disappointed that Abkco chose not to recreate the 3D cover on a limited edition digipak and include a booklet with notes about the album.
B000068FXX|2.0|First, let me say that the 2 stars are not for the musical contents of the CD. That would have been 5-plus stars of course.<br />No, the 2 stars are for the terrible job the folks at A&amp;M have done digitally remastering this album. Or should I say de-analogizing? The sound is much too harsh, and too loud. Just compare the first minute of &quot;Give a little bit&quot; with the original (LP or CD) release and you'll know what I mean.<br />I had the entire remastered collection in my &quot;save for later&quot; basket, but decided to delete them all after listening to this<br />one. I'll stick to the more analog sounding (and still very defined) first releases.<br />For the record: I listened to this CD on my Electrocompaniet EMC1 with 24/192 upsampling, with the Rogers E40a and a pair of<br />LS3A's with AB1 subwoofers.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I can't add much to the other reviews, except to agree that, yes, this is Mr. Steven's definitive masterwork. This has definitely stood the test of time. As a philosophy major, I can't agree with his narrow religious fanaticism, but his early works show an open-minded seeker with a gift for inspired lyrics and great music. I would also recommend Teaser and the Firecat, along with some great works of literature such as Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, and Why I Am Not A Muslim.

B0000683DH|4.0|I am one of the 3% of the US population who happens to believe that \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\\" is inferior in quality to its predecessor, \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\".  The first Star Trek film had been a unique achievement in sci-fi, one which matched a brilliant score to absolutely stunning visual effects and a highly cerebral plot that was undoubtedly over the heads of the masses of moviegoers with short attention spans.  As a result, it is repeatedly slammed as \\"boring\\" (a highly subjective term, when you consider the film's pivotal importance in the development of Kirk's and Spock's characters, and the mature and sophisticated acting displayed by Shatner and Nimoy),<BR>while \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\" is to this day revered as one of the finest of the ST film series for being its action-packed antidote.<br />There is no doubt that \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\" is the tighter paced, tighter edited and more action-packed film of the two.  It also features a powerful, almost-iconic performance by Montalban as Khan and elements of humor which keep the tone light on its feet.<BR>Its parallels to \\"Moby Dick\\", its themes of revenge and self-sacrifice, and of course Spock's final death scene are appealing and well-executed.  It is never less than enjoyable.  However, to these eyes it is actually *less* of a Star Trek movie than the first film.  Its brand of shoot-em-up battle pyrotechnics and over-the-top spectacle seems more influenced by the \\"Star Wars\\" blockbuster mentality than the quiet, graceful subtleties and artistic beauty of \\"The Motion Picture\\".  The themes of artificial intelligence, exploration and most of the character portrayals in \\"The Motion Picture\\" all smack of Roddenberry's original vision, whereas \\"Wrath Of Khan\\" gives one easier, more simplistic payoffs that remind one of the kind of formula television Harve Bennett cut his teeth in.  To be sure, Bennett saved the franchise--he brought the film in under budget and made Star Trek a success with the mass audience blockbuster mentality.  And it is a fun movie; it is not my intention to change anybody's mind with this review (by now, 99% of all Star Trek fans have their minds firmly made up regarding their opinions of all nine films).  However, I simply prefer the careful details, deliberate pacing and complex themes of the debut film, and have never found them \\"boring\\", \\"silly\\" or \\"pretentious\\".  I have never figured out how the film which played such an important role in the maturation of Spock's character could be so panned by audiences; by contrast, all he does in \\"Wrath Of Khan\\" is sacrifice himself for the ship, something we saw him do many times over in the original series.<br />Anyways, this new director's edition adds two or three extra minutes dealing with Scotty's nephew which are OK but not essential (there's nothing as radical as the major SFX rehaul or edits found for \\"The Motion Picture\\"); on the other hand, the picture and sound quality are perfect.  The special features on disc two are all interesting and worthwhile, especially the interviews with the cast and crew.  As a whole, the new editions of both the first two Star Trek films are up to a very high standard, and I look forward to seeing the rest in this manner.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|this is a very good movie, and the DVD release fully accentuates the goodness of the film.  it comes with a french language track, the real french version (not dubbed in Qubec), and there are many extras on the two CD set.  i would have liked to have also seen a spanish and italian track, but life's not perfect.  there is also an extra musical sequence, and the movie was quite fun to re-watch!

1558216847|4.0|Firstly, I must say that if you are reading this review you should buy the book.  It is an amazing account of the trials that people will go through.  Yet, like many others, the tale is too amazing to believe.  Firstly, the escape from the actual camp is far too easy.  After reading A Prisoner's Duty by Robert C. Doyle I find it hard to beleive that the escape was so easy.  Doyle's book is devoted to how hard it was to simply breach the fortifications of even the most lightly guarded facilites.  Then Doyle talks about how hard it was to often escape even 100 miles.  In this book the escapers not only escape easily but trek about 2,500 miles.  To me this seems too amazing to beleive.  <BR>Even with this though, the book should be read to remind people to be thankfull that no matter how bad life becomes there are far worse fates.
B000002G23|5.0|It's unfortunately rare to find a box set that does what &quot;Message in a Box:  The Complete Recordings&quot; does, which is provide the fan with an economical way to acquire an artist's complete catalogue.<br />Any minor quibbles that one might have with this set, such as the choice of the live tracks, are more than made up for by an unusual level of thoroughness and the excellent re-mastering.  Even the accompanying 65-page booklet is worth a once-through, especially for the three pages of &quot;THE B-SIDES AND OTHER OBSCURE RELEASES:  Sting, Andy and Stewart reminisce&quot;. <br />Of course, what makes this box set excel is the fact that The Police are one of the few bands whose entire body of work (78 tracks in this set) is worth listening to, and much of it is brilliant.  Given the pricing, even those who are only interested in the band's most popular releases should give this package serious consideration.
B00005OWEG|4.0|In one of the many classic in scenes in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The PBR that Captain Willard (Martin Sheen)and the crew are heading up river on spot a boat with Vietnamese natives. The Chief (Albert Hall) decides it's necessary to take a look. Willard disagrees because his mission comes first (for those who don't know the mission is to head up river to kill a Green Beret Colonel who has gone insane)<br />The Chief orders Chef (Frederick Forrest) to board and search the boat. Chef reluctantly gets on and finds nothing but rice and mangos. Then one of the Vietnamese women on the boat runs to grab something and then all hell breaks loose. The entire crew of the boat is shot. Turns out all she was running for was a puppy. The woman is hurt but she's not dead. The Chief decides it would be a good idea to bring her on board and get her medical attention. Captain Willard walks over and shoots the woman. \\"I told you not to stop not let's go.\\" he says.<br />There are many things that bother me about Apocalypse Now: Redux. The biggest one being. The added French Plantation scene. Which is Willard and the crew having dinner at a French plantation discussing various politics and the absurdity of the war. Well my question is if this man is willing to commit cold blooded murder to get on with his mission. Why is he having dinner with french people.<br />Another added scene is a scene with the Playboy bunnies where Willard trades sexual favors with the bunnies for some fuel. This scene truly has nothing to do with the overall plot. The fact that these guys are gonna have sex with some Playboy bunnies is completely irrelevent.<br />Two more problems are the changes in some characters.

But when outstanding technical abilities meet an absolute superior<BR>songwriting and composing as in the case of Dream Theater the result is very likely to be an album full of the most impressive and enjoyable rock music one can imagine. &quot;Awake&quot; is a masterpiece of a rare kind. Even Dream Theater themselves can't do any better. To fans of exceptional, demanding rock music, I wouldn't recommend any CD more highly than this one.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|This record makes it clear that, for the time being at least, Prince has abandoned any hope of acceptance by the mainstream. However, given the dreadful quality of his recent \\"commercial\\" work - whose nadir was \\"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\\", which grimly copied Santana's has-been-with-hot-young-guest-stars format to the bitter end - this could only be a good thing. The result is this cheerfully bizarre disc which, whether you end up liking it or not, you'll have to admit contains the first really sort-of-genius music he's released in 14 years. (That is, since his masterpiece \\"Lovesexy\\", with which this record, with its processed voices, has a good deal in common.) Admittedly, lyrics like \\"NATO spelled backwards is OTAN\\" fall short of the glory. But Prince was always a lyrical doofus - it's part of his charm.  As far as the basso-profundo voice processing goes, I find it perfectly appropriate in its context and a pleasant bit of musical texture in its own right. So there.    Putting aside the songwriting, the instrumental performances are top-flight. This very lively and jazzy \\"band\\" - which, thanks to studio magic, has the auteur on several instruments simulataneously - is, I would argue, the best to appear on any Prince record. (High praise that.) And Prince's work as a producer, always unfairly overshadowed by the enormous dimension of his other talents, also reaches a new high here. So any Princefolk who tuned out after wasting their money on such dreck as \\"New Power Soul\\" should let bygones be bygones and see what the Skinny MF is up to these days.
0743442539|5.0|John Le Carre's masterful novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, has all the elements one could ever want from a great spy story.  Le Carre brilliantly combines suspense, mystery, location, romance, and a story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page.<BR>   Keeping with the tradition of all well-written spy novels, the action of Le Carre's book grabs the reader from the first scene, and doesn't let go.  Set in the midst of the Cold War in Germany, the author, a former spy himself, has no shortage of material to work with.  He uses it all in creating a brilliant story of a spy who finds himself a part of a complicated plan in a spy war in which all the things he thinks he knows turn out to be lies.  As this unwitting pawn in a dangerous game understands just how deeply the untruths he has been told run, the reader constantly finds himself wrongly guessing as to the extent of the circumstances the character is really in.  <BR>   The reader stumbles in this manner until the very end, when the whole thing finally makes sense and an unthinkable conclusion is drawn.  Here the brilliance of Le Carre's work realy shines, for the reader discovers he, just as the main character, has been led along a path of powerful deceit for the entire story.  For those looking for a great spy novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold truly has it all.
B00004TCPJ|4.0|If you want classic, hard charging Horowitz, buy his 1951 recording. If you want a poetic performance, buy Van Cliburn's 1958 recording. Both of these albums are spectacular, and listening to them is one of life's great pleasures. However, in his 1978 performance, Horowitz indulges in the sentimentality characteristic of his later career. Such romanticism is not his comparative advantage, and this recording does not satisfy so well as others.
B000068OSK|5.0|Most of the tracks on this CD are in the same vein as Zeppelin's and AC/DC's blues covers. It's raw, it pounds and it drives. It's good. If you like Led Zeppelin's bluesier tracks from I and II, I think you will like this. The fifth track on the CD 'Sugar Never Tasted So Good' is reminiscent of the tracks on Zeppelin's III, with Page-like acoustic licks, melodic strumming and pounding drums. There is also a punk strain running through this CD.<br />I have heard the best in the world play Johnson's 'Stop Breaking Down', but the White Stripes' cover surpasses them all. <br />With all the comparisons I've made with Zeppelin, you might think The White Stripes are a LZ cover band. Well, it ain't so.  You can definitely hear the many influences The White Stripes take from, but this is something new and powerful.
B00006IU73|5.0|In this world of instant ready-mixed music, it is refreshing to find a band that is holding the flame of Progressive/Mainstream rock music as well a Porcupine Tree are doing. Still wearing out my CD player with the likes of Signify and Up the Downstair, I wasn't exactly desperate for their latest release 'In Absentia', but this offering only acts to enhance my music-listening life even further.<br />To me this album is a culmination of all PT's talents, from the dark, moody sonic creation of 'Lips of Ashes' to the dynamic intro of 'Blackest Eyes' and the crescendo in 'Gravity Eyelids', this CD has everything. It is already pushing Signify as their greatest moment in my eyes (or should I say ears!).<br />This album reminds me more of Stupid Dream than Lightbulb Sun and sees a return to the longer instrumental sections with their Ozric-like rhythm arrangements. The standard is excellent throughout, although I feel the last track is a little of an anti-climax.<br />I was disappointed to read of Chris Maitland's departure, but new incumbent Mr Gavin Harrison has certainly not lowered the lofty standards of PT. Sadder still is the band's apparent 'emigration' from mine and their homeland to the US, testament to the British public's inexplicable distain for quality music. <br />Thank God for the likes of Amazon.com and credit cards, or I would have had to wait for the European release date in January for my copy. Mind you, by that time I'll probably need a new one anyway!
B00006IUL7|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Pacino was great as always. But, it was was very interesting seeing Robin Williams playing against type.<br />There is a good story, made up of two sub-plots. Nicely done.
B000002IOY|5.0|If you never heard this CD before, and you call yourself a metalhead, you better get your [act] together and take a listen.<BR>This CD has fast in your face, make you wanna thrash around the room all night plus it has some [great] sounding slow songs that are eerie as they are nice sounding. If you like heavy music, this is one CD that should be in your collection or have a regular home in your CD player. Take a listen, you won't be dissapointed. If you like Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Megadeth, then you should feel right at home with Overkill's The Years of Decay CD!
0385495323|5.0|This is a really good book for beginners in criptography.<br />It has the story of criptography (the explanations of ciphers and how to break them) since the first ciphers.
B0000214F0|3.0|The remake on DVD from a video quality standpoint is poor, its dark<BR>and grainy. The laser disc versions video was excelllent. Nice audio <BR>but it doesn't need it. The film content was everything I remembered<BR>and possibly more. Not for the faint of heart or prudish. <BR>Violence is graphic and gory. Sex seens very explict, including homosexual scenes.
0807281956|5.0|Harry Potter...hmm...what can I say; it brings out the imagination of a child. The book was wonderful. I enjoyed it very much with all the action going on at one time. It seemed to me as if there was so much action going on, but yet still you could understand it. The writing style is wonderful, easy to understand and fun to read. Just think when you read Harry Potter you are entering into a dream world of magic and fun.<BR>Harry Potter goes through so much excitement at his stay at Hogwarts.  He is always trying to see what is going on at this Wizardy school.  The book is about how Harry finds out that is beloved parents were wizards before they died, and he has that same power as they do.  He goes to Hogwarts a school for wizards and is forced to learn all the magic and powers.  His problem that he has to face is that the man that killed his parents, Voldemont, has come back to regain his power and finished where he left off and kill Harry.  Only Harry can stop this evil sorcerer, but I am not going to tell you what happened next.   Each character brings out a trait of some kind and allows you to relate to him/her.  While reading this book have fun, kick back, and relax.  Harry Potter will bring out the imagination in a child and an adult and you will enjoy every moment of it.
0871137380|2.0|I was really eager to read this book after seeing the movie - not the way I like to do things, I normally like to read the book before the movie, but it didn't work out that way this time.<br />Some of the characters in the book were really well picked out.  You had a good sketch of many of the character's backgrounds, their families, their history in the military - basically just how they came to be where they were.  This was effective in small amounts - I found that it turned to just listing the heritage of the people there because they felt the author had to.<br />Unfortunately, I found the book so bogged down in detail that after the first 10 chapters I put it down. It was incredibly narrative, which is a style that I am not so fond of - it was narrative in a plain way - it seemed to \\"tell\\" a lot of the story instead of \\"showing\\" it. It goes into immense detail of the layout of the streets and buildings, which I found tedious instead of interesting.<br />There was one other aspect of the book that hit me into the first few pages.  This feeling may dissappear towards the end of the book, but it was very \\"Americanised\\" - that they were meant to be there, that America was doing the right thing.  On the other hand, it also states that most of the soldiers did not know why they were there - that to me was incredibly significant.<br />This book is probably very accurate in its description of the event, the people, and the place.  It is valuable to have these types of books so that those who are interested can look back and see what really happenned.  This book may appeal to a more military-minded reader - I must say I am not a big reader of military novels myself.  If you are not that kind of reader either, I would recommend not picking up this book unless you are ready to plow through incredible amounts of detail to find the interesting information.
B000002UA9|5.0|This was the album that thrust the Beatles into the spotlight in England. [It would be almost another year before America would embrace the lads from Liverpool.]  After honing their skills in Hamburg and gigging around England, they shot to No. 1 in the U.K. with &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and followed up with this LP.<br />Eight of these songs are Lennon-McCartney originals, the rest were taken from their live show repertoire.  Of the former, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; is a terrific Little Richard-inspired rocker and &quot;Love Me Do&quot; (their first U.K. single) features some wonderful harmonica by Lennon.  Of the latter, Lennon turns in a fine performance on Arthur Alexander's &quot;Anna&quot; and the definitive version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;--two minutes and thirty-three seconds of primal rock 'n' roll.  [And all done with two guitars, a bass and a drum kit!  When was the last time you heard music like THAT on the radio?]<br />This was the Beatles at their most innocent and arguably their most enthusiastic.  This album belongs in any serious music fan's collection.  ESSENTIAL
B00005B1W5|5.0|Since we purchased this DVD we have been watching it over and over again for more than 10 times (in one month) and we still want to watch it again when we have free time.  The DVD &quot;Yanni in Acropolis&quot; is a very good one.  However, in my opinion, this one is even much much better.  Every songs are well performed but there are two songs that we like the most: The NightingGails and Love is All with Vann Johnson.
B00005B6NC|2.0|This movie start well but it gets boring and uninspiring afterward. Overall: Mediocre.
B00005JK8K|3.0|I was looking forward to this movie's release.<BR>That is, back last year right before it was postponed by eight months for some reason or another. But this summer, when I saw Windtalkers I had already been through 'Behind Enemy Lines',<BR>'Black Hawk Down' and 'We Were Soldiers'.<BR>Did I really want to see ANOTHER war movie?<BR>Of course, if it was directed by John Woo who proved his great action flair with the action hits Face/Off and Mission Impossible 2. So I went to see this as any John Woo fan would, and suffice it to say, I was quite dissapointed. I could hardly tell that 'Windtalkers' was directed by Woo, except for one quick scene that featured two soldiers face to face with their guns out and pointed to each other, ala Face/Off's famous Travolta/Cage scene.<BR>But I mean really, you don't see any of the director's trademark doves, and believe me, even in a battlefield he could have found a way to work them into the movie. The story itself is a flimsy little adaption of something that occurred during World War 2 involving Navajo Indians who were code talkers, but I'm sure you've heard all about that. Nicholas Cage portrays Joe Enders,<BR>an american soldier who has a problem with his hearing and after seeing one too many battles is emotionaly fried.<BR>This gives Cage the chance to play his usual character as of late, <BR>that of a hopeless man who thanks to someone, in this case his codetalker (Adam Beach), discovers what life is again.<BR>The acting is sub-par with the best work coming from Adam Beach, but that isn't saying a whole lot. After a while in the movie each explosion, each death or gory image, became less and less startling, until eventually you'd expect a bomb blast and limbs flying and it just doesn't mean that much anymore. <BR>The ending itself is predictable since you know from the commercial how it's going to end and who is going to ultimately die protecting his codetalker.<BR>After considering the hell that these guys went through I can't help but feel that they deserve a much better movie, but hollywood, please, no more war movies for at least a year or so.<BR>Or they will all just become repeative, and who would that be good for?
B000069AT7|5.0|I recently purchased this immense Ultimate Gift Package and I cannot express in words the quality.  If you want to buy a good DVD, buy this package.  You will be amazed!!!  With tons of goodies not available with the standard release, it makes for the Ultimate E.T. experience.  With incredible quality sound, picture, and beautiful packaging, this 4 disc pack should be regarded as one of the greatest DVD's of all time.  Though the Ultimate Gift Package is more expensive, I highly recommend that you still purchase this package.  It is most definitely worth the money.  I hope that you do purchase this package and if you do, please enjoy it as I have.  Thank you for your time.
6304508611|5.0|This is one of the most disturbing movies ever made! It's really scary and disguisting! The best King movie is Salem's Lot, but this is right up there with it. I would recommend this to any horror fan!
B00006J3WH|5.0|As a loyal Buffy fan I immediately ordered by copy of the Once More With Feeling soundtrack as soon as it became available.  I throughly enjoyed the soundtrack, and currently it is being played over and over again in my jeep's CD player.  Having watched the musical episode just as many times, it was easily to visualize the scenes as they progressed and I had no trouble understanding the segues or fillers, such as &quot;They Got the Mustard Out.&quot;  However, if you are NOT a Buffy fan this is not the CD for you, and may perhaps turn you off from exploring the world that is BTVS.  Unless you can fully understand the premise of the episode, you might be inclined to think this CD self-indulgent of the brillant Joss Whedon.  Especially since, it is clear, that few of the cast are professional singers.  Still shout outs to Amber Benson and Anthony Stewart Head, whose performances both individually and together (in a brillant piece of music) made me want to hear more.  Also, both Sarah Michelle Gellar, singing for the first time, and James Marsters, who is inching into the music world, deliver great performances...what they lack in musical training they make up for with sheer charisma.  Overall, a must-have for the Buffy fanatic!
B00005ATQI|5.0|This film has got to be one of the scariest films ever! It is so well made! Great acting, great scares, and just great everything. Rent or buy this movie now. It is so scary!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Great movie, but the special features are much too long and tedious to look at. I tried to sit down and just watch the special features, but I found it near impossible. I had to turn it off and go to something else quickly. It just seemed like a waste of time to put all that stuff on there. I can't imagine watching all that footage, even now, it's making me sick to my stomach... Excuse me while I head to the bathroom to vomit, LOL!
0380820846|5.0|Contrary to the opinions of some reviewers, I felt this was the best Bridgerton book so far.  It was obvious from previous novels who Lady Whistledown was, and Colin's declaration that he would never marry Penelope was only proof that they belonged together.  With those ideas firmly in place, of course I wasn't surprised by any of the action of the book.  (Gasp! They end up together in the end? Well, I never!)<br />What I loved about this book, however, was the wry narration, both from Penelope's and Colin's points of view.  From the first paragraph, I was hooked, and I chuckled my way through the entire book.  I daresay some who prefer nonstop action would have wished for more angst, drama, and fisticuffs, but that was not the point of this tale.  This book is a sweet story of old friends who learn more about each other and themselves.  It could have been a stereotyped tale of Colin learning to see past Penelope's plumpness to her sterling character, but instead both characters demonstrated strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities that were more charming than any of the other Bridgertons.
B000003C2U|5.0|To be honest, I'm not the biggest death metal, speed metal etc. fan in the world.  I love the energy, but much of it is severely lacking in musicality and/or drenched in silly violent/Satanic imagery.  This band is (was) something different.  Sonic assaults both technically impressive and musically creative.  Some intriguing lyrics (when I'm able to decifer them).  They sound good during their brief quiet interludes, and they thrash as hard as the heaviest.  I particularly like the relentless, bone-crunching drums - just incredible.  \\"Suicide Machine\\" is a standout and even the dreamscape diversion of \\"Cosmic Sea\\" is very impressive.  The singer does (did) sound like a demonic banshee, impressively without voice distortion.<br />I'm not even a huge fan of Metallica in their speed metal heyday, but THIS is the genuine article.  I'm told that the term \\"death metal\\" originated from this band.  I'm not really sure if that's true, but I do know they are certainly worthy of it!
B000002KXV|5.0|I echo the sentiments of other reviewers, but would also add that Michael Brecker's solo on &quot;Maxine&quot; alone is worth getting this CD.  Also check out the horns on &quot;Ruby Baby.&quot;  If you like Steely Dan, this album will not disappoint!
B000000WCV|5.0|This CD is very repetitive and sometimes the songs only have 2 or three parts.  Most ideas are rythmic and simple drum machine patterns are all over the place, but it all works.  From the quiet house of Revolution 909, the assaulting simplistic modwheel adventure Rollin' and Scratchin', and the smooth flavor of Fresh, you know these guys aren't just screwing around with expensive synthesizers.
B00006LLOG|4.0|Although he had already released a self-titled solo album, I believe Transformer marks the transition for Lou Reed from a member of the Velvet Underground to a solo artist. There's some great material on this album, including Vicious, Walk on the Wild Side, and Satellite of Love, along with some less engaging numbers (hence I gave it 4 stars versus 5). The production and backing by David Bowie and Mick Ronson add greatly to the quality and richness of the recording. The remastering seems to bring this out even more. And although this is a 30th anniversary release, the music has held up very well and doesn't sound dated at all; in fact, Transformer continues to be a highly influential album that is frequently called upon by contemporary musical scores.
6305313687|5.0|I really dont think I have ever seen a movie like this before. Itreally makes you think and all though there are some violent parts in it i really believe it has a positve message behind it. From the opening scene where Edward Norton gives that guy a \\"California Smile\\" this movie had my full attention. I never thought I would see that in a movie. My only beef with with the film is that DVD barely has any extras it would have nice to have some commentary by Norton and or the director oh well. Great movie 5/5.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I remember when this movie first came out. I loved it. Now, approximately 7 years later, I finally got a chance to see it again. I bought the Special Edition DVD and was amazed by the features, and the movie, once again, put a big smile on my face. I was blown away by all the behind the scenes footage that was shown. I recommend this DVD for ANYONE! Go buy it!
B00003CXB7|5.0|Had Altman not given the people of Califonia a sneak-peek of M*A*S*H it would have been shelved and locked away in the Fox Vault, never to see the light of day.  But Altman, like each member of the M*A*S*H cast, was a rebel.  He and his cast and crew dared to tell the truth in a time when Hollywood was supposed to be a dream factory.<br />M*A*S*H is a black comedy that takes a stab at everything from the definaition of humanity and medical ethics to the reasons and methods of war.  5 miles from the Korean Front Line, the M*A*S*H characters are violently pushed to the brink.  Some break.  But others survive by pushing back with humor, love and blackmail.  The movie opens with the arrival of Hawkeye Pierce and Duke Forester at the 4077, a number that has been immortalized by the movie and the series that followed in it's footsteps, and follows them as they try and survive their tour of duty.<br />The bonuses on this DVD are outstanding and are well worth watching.  Make sure you have the time to soak everything in, because the interviews with Altman and the cast are filled with M*A*S*H facts that will amaze you.  For example: In some night shots of the Speaker you can see the moon in the background.  The night those sceens were shot was the same night American astronaughts landed on the moon.
B00000F1D3|4.0|Cher made a huge comeback in late 1998 with BELIEVE, a song that made her comeback a success. This album dabbles mostly in electronica, which was very successful and a formula she again used on her 2002 album LIVING PROOF. The title track and hit single is an inspiring song about picking yourself up after failed chances. The rest of the album is pretty good too. \\"All Or Nothing\\" should have been a huge hit, its the highlight of the album. \\"Runaway\\" is another strong suit, should have been a single. She remakes her 80's classic \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" on here with an updated sound, excellent track. \\"Strong Enough\\" was the second single and basically has a similar theme to \\"Believe\\". Ohter highlights include \\"Love Is The Groove\\" and \\"Dov'e L'Amore\\". The only songs I didn't care for and felt were more bside quality were \\"The Power\\" and \\"Taxi Taxi\\". Cher may have comeback with this album, but I always felt her 1995 album ITS A MANS WORLD should have done that, as I feel its better than this album, but still check this one out nonetheless.
B000002JS0|5.0|This is the debut of the infernal Young brothers and his gang of bad guys. From the booklet (with some hilarious letters to the members of the band) to the songs, all is urgent, raw and very exciting. Songs like &quot;The Jack&quot; (with dirty double meaning lyrics), &quot;Live Wire&quot; and &quot;T.N.T.&quot; are among the best hard rock songs ever written. A classic, and one of the best debut albuns in rock history.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Recently T2 special edition was released and made a big impact on DVD fans. This disc really helps the movie sound more like the second film. You couldn't ask for more on this DVD except commentary but the other voices documentary gives you all the good information you ever wanted to know about this film. Watching this DVD makes you   want to watch the special editon of the second film because their quality and sound make the film confortable to watch without the 80's sound effects. The truck explosion, the police massacre and the famous &quot;I'll be back&quot; sequence has a smashing new sound to the audiance. The shotguns and the terminator's gun give the film a better experience. If you own T@ this installment is a must have! <BR>The delelted scenes are great because you get a chance to see some great scenes that never made it to the movie. Scenes that show the black police officer commenting on Michael Bein's story of the future and an unnforgettable performance of Micheal Bein's charactor that was soo great but made the movie slower. <BR>The DVD menu is almost like the DVD menue on the second film which makes them almost a like. So add this to your collection and enjoy the new features!
B000006O7C|3.0|After the euphoria of Grace, this unfinished album is sort of a letdown. I'm glad to own it, as it will stand as Buckley's final work, but I rarely listen to it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I can not believe Norah Jones is only 22. Her voice is beautiful but she sings with such experience. When she does Hank Williams's &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; she sounds like she really understands what he was talking about. This album is a keeper. I'll still be playing this ten years from now and Norah Jones is going to have a brilliant career.
0316666343|2.0|I just finished this book and it took me 2 1/2 weeks (quite a long time for the page length).  I, of course, read it because it seemed all of America was doing the same thing.  The point of view was interesting, and the story of the grieving family kept my attention.  However, for the most part I couldn't wrap myself around this one.  Perhaps there were too many subplots and minor characters.<br />Also my expectations may have been too high, but the book seemed to really slog along with really very little accomplished.  Also, the &quot;possession&quot; and the icicle at the end were very anti-climatic.<br />I think a movie of this book would be a real mistake (think Shipping News) but will probably be inevitable.
0792833201|5.0|I remembered that I saw her in that movie when I was younger, it was the one of the best horror movie I have ever seen. It doesn't have anything to do with those horror movies that are commonly showed, like for example: in many horror movies, you can see the blood spurting everywhere, bodies cutten off and stuff like that. In that movie, Poltergeist, you wont see things like that. But it does show the best of horror parts in that movie, in fact it does remind me of old classic horror movies. I do recommend you to watch this movie and Heather O'Rourke was the best of actresses I have ever seen since Drew Barrymore.
B00004YKUY|5.0|Arrival is filled with glorious tracks which display the band's songwriting strength and melodic grooves.  Steve Augeri, the current lead singer of Journey, is more than up to the challenge of preserving the band's heritage in addition to moving the band forward to new heights.  There are rockers (Higher Place, World Gone Wild) as well as bluesy ballads (Kiss Me Softly, my favorite). I highly recommend this cd to any fan of melodic music.

B0000640VO|5.0|Let me make something perfectly clear right from the start. Amelie is not a comedy. Amelie is not a romance movie. Amelie is nothing less than a work of fine art! Amelie is certainly not a romantic comedy and if you set out to judge it by these standards you are apt to be disappointed. Also bear in mind that like a classical symphony, it must be experienced several times before this wonderful movie can be fully appreciated. <br />I first heard the word, \\"Amelie\\" on a pay-per-view ad, the first thing I thought of was a brand of motor oil from the fifties. (Maybe spelled Amalie?),  \\"Well\\", I thought, \\"any girl named after a brand of engine oil is worth checking out\\". Then when I saw the teaser on TV I thought; \\"Any movie that features a black-haired, doe-eyed pixie and an animated pig-lamp must be worth seeing\\".<br />I expected a light entertainment, a bit-o-fluff romantic comedy, and thats exactly what I saw. But deep in my soul I began to sense something else. So I watched it again and a whole new world began to reveal itself. then somewhere around the fifth viewing it hit me; This is cinematic magic! A symphonic dream of light, sound and love brought to life for all to see. Yes, it took five viewings before it got through my hard shell of cynicism. I am so glad it did!<br />Amelie lives in a beautiful fantasy world where streets are clean and uncongested. A world where waitresses and store clerks find happiness and love. Where bad guys get there comeuppance and not a single drop of blood is spilled. For anyone who grew up lonely, got picked on but never picked for the team, those who would never be a cheerleader or have a chance to date one, this movie tells your story. The entire film is populated with also-rans. Lame bartenders, failed writers, hypochondriacs. People like we meet everyday in the grim, soul crushing, ultraviolet stained world of reality. But these lucky souls live in a beautiful, green and orange colored world where hope still lives and dreams still come true.<br />After a long, hard, day at work, when I've dodged all the angry and bitter people on the freeway and performed all the daily chores that let me keep resident on earth for yet another day, then its time. I take off my shoes, relax and enter Amelie's little world. Soon I feel the anger and depression slip away and for a while, life is worth living again.<br />Maybe this movie should be prescribed as therapy.<br />
0385505833|5.0|What a pleasant surprise to discover another side of Grisham's work. Light, fluffy and entertaining, this book is a great satire of the Holiday Season. The characters are very funny, the situations hilarious, and the dialogues right on! It is a mix of &quot;Scrooge&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; with a touch of &quot;Everybody loves Raymond&quot;. It will rejuvenate you and I garantee that upon putting this book down, you will see some of your Holiday traditions in a different light.<br />A great little gift for hard-to-shop-for people. Entertainment factor garanteed!
0375414053|5.0|I Don't Know How She Does It is a remarkable read--remarkable in that it is an extremely funny novel that manages to remain absolutely true to the lives of working mothers.  Instead of exaggerating Kate Reddy's (the working mom) situation, Pearson relies on a wonderfully dry wit (and the innate humor of the situation) to make us laugh.  And it's all true.  What working mom, hasn't, like Kate Reddy does in the opening paragraphs of the novel, distressed some store-bought item to make it look like she baked/cooked/prepared it?  For Kate, it's pies, for you it may be potato salad or brownies.  While most of the subject matter will make you laugh, there are other parts that may bring tears to your eyes.  Kate has an incredibly demanding work schedule, but loves her children deeply.  She is torn between her dual roles as investment banker and mommy, can't desert either of them and thus fears she is doing both of them poorly.  She muses on the situation of women in the workforce, particularly mothers throughout the novel and she hits the nail on the head every time.  I believe most working  moms will feel as if Pearson has gotten into their heads and somehow articulately, succinctly and cleverly put their thoughts and ideas on paper.  Pearson remains always true to the quandries working moms find themselves in--nothing is exaggerated for laughs, or for tears, for that matter.  The novel is terrific.  It will keep you laughing and you certainly don't have to be a working mom to appreciate it.  Kate Reddy is a wonderfully sympathetic heroine, facing real and difficult choices.  Her resolution of them all is satisfying.  A terrific novel and I must say thank you to Ms. Pearson for putting it all down on paper.  Enjoy.
6305971099|1.0|Halloween 4 was dumb.  THIS FILM IS DUMBER! Its basically the same movie as the last one, with Mike Myers chasing the little girl again.  But this time, he doesn't go after her directly.  He goes after everyone else in town hoping to draw her out, because, oh yeah, she's PSYCHIC NOW!  That's right, campers, now every time the guy in the mask kills someone, she knows it and sees it through the psychic force, or whatever it is.  Oh, but there is a little difference.  This time, Mike actually tries to kill the little girl with a CAR he steals from some punk he killed.  I guess Mike was auditioning for a part in the Fast and the Furious. Oh, and when are teenagers in this town going to learn not to have Halloween parties and make out alone in dark houses and barns!  Do they hand out stupid pills in this town?  And Donald Pleasance returns as the Nutty Professor, and tries to reason with Mike, but of course Mike just kills him (or does he?). And why doesn't the Sherriff's office learn they can't kill this guy with guns, instead get a bazooka ready for Halloween night. I also wonder how this town survives after several Halloweens with Mike running around.  He's wiped out whole generations of teenagers in this town.  Oh, and what's with the old guy in the beginning of helps Mike then gets killed a year later.  The plot of this film is even more ridiculous and razor thin than the last one.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I decided to order this album after reading so many (mostly) good reviews about it, and a few other recommendations. Although I must admit, on the first listening of the CD, I wasn't 'in awe' of it, as I have heard other albums with similar styles and this one didn't seem do anything very different from them, although it definitely was 'nice'. But on subsequent listenings, it really 'grew on me', and now I think it's one of the most 'inspiring' albums, not just 'relaxing', run-of-the-mill new age CDs. <br />Although the style has definitely been heard before, I don't agree with one of the reviewer's statements that it's a poor copy of Enigma's music, as Enigma was not the first one to write this type of music and it's a very popular style in general, in new age, that cannot be only claimed by Enigma. I don't think it's 'slow-building' either, as it's told as a story that is very enjoyable to listen to, I wouldn't mind having more tracks!<br />So if you enjoy new age music (yes, like Enigma, Delerium, Era, Vangelis), then you will enjoy this album too, most likely. Don't hesitate to get a copy of it.
6305546789|3.0|Its hard for me to be objective when reviewing this film.  On its own, it was a decent horror picture.  But as a precedent, Halloween was the primary impetus for starting the horrible genre of slasher films that dominated the 1980's horror cinema.  Films like the Friday the 13th films the numerous and stupid Halloween sequels totally ruined the horror genre by taking all of the mystery, atmosphere, and style out of horror films and turning them into bloodbaths of violence and gore.  But its not really fair to blame all of that on this film, because in actuality, Halloween is quite a bit different than the slasher films that followed because it did have mystery, atmosphere, and style, and was not overtly gorry with minimized violence. The film's true scares comes not from the violence and the killing, but from the suspense of the picture, not knowing when Michael Myers is going to pop out of the shadows.  Its a pity that all of the filmmakers who set out to make those horrible slasher films that followed did not learn the right lessons from Halloween, that its suspense and atmosphere, not violence and gore, that causes genuine scares.  If that had occurred, Halloween might be a true classic for redefining the horror genre but still maintaining its style.  Instead, this film should be remembered as a good one that unfortunately started a poor genre that almost ruined the horror cinema.  Thankfully, Wes Craven came along with Scream in the mid-1990's which actually showcased how laughable and stupid the slasher films of the 1980's were, and all but killed off the slasher film genre.  In conclusion, Halloween is worth a look see.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Talk about musical value on a disc! Not an ill written note or rhyme in the mix.<br />Ian Anderson is perhaps one of the consistently best musician/composers of the age.  He's still at it.  Witty, sharp, still has an attitude, and still writes interestingly crafted tunes.  There is musical charisma in this crew and no matter the band's lineup, Anderson makes it happen. TAAB, while a crowning musical achievement of the time for the JT gang, has never stopped them from matching and even more than occasionally surpassing what was and still is a very solid satisfying piece of music, not to mention the incredible tongue in cheek lyrics.
B000069AUI|5.0|Lush, sonic, moody, as driving as a locomotive and sensuous as a wisp of smoke.  This cd blew me away on the first listen.  If you like Pink Floyd, REM, or Radiohead, this will be right up your alley.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I admit, I had a very difficult time reading the J.K. Rowling books, for some odd reason.  I attempted to read the first Harry Potter book several times, but each time it seemed to serve better as a dose of valium than as an interesting read.  That's a first for me, esp. with a book of this genre. However, while I still struggle to get through the reading, I must give the movie version 5 stars, as I'm completely fascinated and impressed with the amount of work put into its making.  From what I hear (from those who've finished the books), the movie has it's differences in certain plot parts, or has omitted parts that die-hard fans are up-in-arms about...but isn't the usually the case when a book goes to film?  That difference aside, if you want a magical, fast-moving film that's suitable for children and adults alike, get this one.  I own it and have watched it at least 4 times (and it's a long movie!).  Can't wait for Part 2 of the movie!
0446605409|2.0|I liked the sarcasm and wit of the main character, but for heavens sake, I want a thriller to move along at a brisker pace.  I lost interest 2/3 of the way through.
0156013983|1.0|...This Book is about a nutcase who draws snakes with elephants inside and becomes a pilot because the \\" grandes personnes \\" wanted him to stop drawing nonsense and become something useful. Anyhow, he crashes and hallucinates about this stupid little kid who calls himself \\"le Petit Prince\\" who lives all alone on a planet the size of a table. One day, a talking flower comes along and makes him depressed so he somehow magically goes to see other planets and ends up on earth where he meets a talking fox and Antoine de Saint-Exupere. He then regrets leaving his planet and tells a talking snake to kill him so he can \\" return to his planet\\". So now, after reading my review you see what a waste of valuable time this book is.
B000002MUQ|5.0|I was completely floored at just how much I liked this CD when I first played it.  I'm a huge Van Halen fan and must say that after listening to this recording dozens of times that I rank it #2 in my VH collection just behind their first release.  For you diehard VH fans you know how difficult it is to choose your favorite.  For you DLR die-hards, get over it.<br />I say without hesitation that I enjoy the hell out of every track-except maybe 'Big Fat Money'- on this album.  I agree with an earlier review that this goes against the tidal wave of grunge rock which hit the 90s, although I do like several grunge bands.  It shouldn't matter under what circumstances this CD was released-this is pure VH.<br />This release should be in the Amazon essential recordings.
0375414053|5.0|My wife bought this book and devoured it in a weekend, doing nothing else but read it. She then handed it to me and I loved every page. Allison Pearson's Kate Reddy is one of the most fascinating female characters I have ever encountered. She and Bridget Jones have made me appreciate and love the woman I wake up next to even more. I recommend this book to anyone, female or male.
B00006F7S4|5.0|There are few albums that makes you wonder. When listening to Beck's sea change for example you start wondering how devastating breaking up can get that it will turn a Comic and happy white Prince like artist to a melancholic `I'm not sure I will live to sing my next song' Dylan. It's his first album that you don't envy his talent, don't admire his vital energies you just start preparing your self  to the day she will walk away and you just wont have Ningel Gordich's phone number to help you sing the pain. These kind of albums makes you become evil sometimes as well.. there a few singers that cry so harmonically that you wish they will stay that way until the next time they will walk in to their studio. Five tears indeed.
B0000041LA|5.0|All I wish to say is that I bought this recording only because the NPR guide recommended it for the third concerto.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all five.  The concerto for the left hand is a gem.  That is all I wish to say.
078324228X|4.0|The thing this movie needs the most is a new cover! Usually, the cover will give some indications about the movie. This one does not. I have enjoyed most of Denzel Washington's movies and this is yet another. This is a true story which makes you hurt, but not necessarily cry. Such injustice. The transfer is good quality and the cast does an excellent job. The ending gets wrapped up almost abruptly (it takes over two hours to get there, another two minutes would have been better). Overall, a good Sunday night movie.
0316666343|3.0|Well, yes, most of the fan fare for this book is warranted. <br />Though the concept isn't new - except for the idea that every person has his or her own heaven - it is well written and one can get emotionally involved in the novel (a good sign of a good read). <br />It's great for the light reader.
B00005JK8K|3.0|This movie attempts to tell the story of the Navajo code talkers during World War II.  An outstanding idea but I feel the movie falls short of giving the subject proper treatment.  It is a war movie, straight forward action movie.  It portrays close contact fighting and the horrors of war.  It is full of action but unfortunately the action only carries it so far, to a 3 star rating.  I would have enjoyed a little more, something, to keep me interested since I was expecting a little more of the code talker story and less of a battle film.  I can only watch straight ahead war scenes for a certain amount of time without some interluding story as well.    <br />But if you like war scenes this movie excells.  It shows the waste and the fear of men in battle as well as the bravery and bonds that are formed.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is my all time favorite Disney movie, and I'm thrilled that it has become one of my 2 year old's favorites too -- no coincidence.  However, now that we are watching it with a two year old, realize that this is not a movie a toddler can watch alone.<br />There are many distressing scenes as other reviewers have said, but what really bothers my husband more so than me, is that for e.g. in the roustabouts song where they set up the circus, and in the scene where they tie up Dumbo's mommy, the African American roustabouts are not considered worthwhile of being depicted with facial features.  I guess it reflects the times when the movie was made.  You would watch this with the same advisorys as reading Mark Twain.  Its a lovely song, and<br />overall the movie has the opposite message, of being tolerant to differences in features/characteristics because everyone is special.<br />I love this movie and always watch with my son, and in the fire scene I explain that they are clowns and pretending, though Dumbo doesn't want to be a clown.  Luckily, from the Baby Newton DVD, he already had a much more positive image of clowns. So he seems to be able to understand that its supposed to be funny, though we empathize with Dumbo and rather want to cry.  As for the elephants crashing scene etc. well, I can only say that building and breaking up tall towers, crashing cars, etc is a favorite toddler activity :-)  And Mommy here always gets a snuggle kiss for the Baby Mine song. My son also noticed that there is no Daddy figure depicted, and I tell him that his Daddy is the same as Mommy and always there for him.
0767802470|5.0|I first saw this movie nearly 15 years ago and the movie stayed in my mind all these years. Despite being made in the 80's, this film does not look dated at all. Demonstrate superbly the absurdity of war. I am most impressed by the role played by the Captain. Talking about leadership and bring out the best in your men!
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham is certainly capable of surprising his readers.  &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a big departure, both in theme and style, from the author's earlier works.  It is a seriocomic look at one couple's attempt to cut Christmas out of their lives for just one year.<br />Luther and Nora Krank have always pulled out all the stops for Christmas.  They always buy a beautiful Christmas tree and throw a lavish holiday party.  However, this year, Luther Krank has decided that he would rather not spend thousands of dollars on preparing for the holiday.  Instead, he decides to skip Christmas altogether.  No tree, no decorations, no donations to the police department, and no fancy party.  He and his wife will use the money that they save to take an exciting Caribbean cruise.  The Krank's neighbors are scandalized and furious, since they believe that Luther and Nora have selfishly turned their backs on sacred tradition.<br />Grisham captures the feeling of living in a small town. He shows that although the inhabitants of small towns may at times be clannish and judgmental, they can also be very kind and supportive of one another.  Luther, as his name implies, is somewhat cranky, yet he is at heart a kind and caring man.  Although Luther's wife agrees to his &quot;skipping Christmas&quot; plan, when things change, Nora shows that she has an iron will of her own.  Grisham's &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a sweet and touching story about the true meaning of the holiday season.  The author's gentle humor and his understated message make this a delightful book that is sure to entertain readers of all ages.
B000002H2H|5.0|Kill 'em All is a very good album, no doubt, but this is the album that proved that Metallica would be a one of the greatest ever. Ride the Lightning imporves everything from Kill 'em All, and adds more depth and more dimensions to there music. This album is not quite perfect, but it comes pretty close( I actually gave this cd a mere 4 stars in a previous review. I can't imagine why.)<br />I will start with my one real complaint. The song \\"Escape\\" isn't very good. It's alright, and certainly far from bad, but everything else on this album crushes it. The production isn't great, but is WAY better than on Kill 'em All, and better than Puppets and Justice too.<br />Though this isn't a concept album, a few themes seem to be repeated a bit. Death is a major theme, as well as the individual versus societal oppression and helplessness. The lyrics certainly aren't brilliant, but they're sort of interesting, and they aren't ever bad enough to distract you from the rest of the album, and they're certainly much improved from Kill 'em All. These lyrics are a lot more serious, and more based in the real world than their previous ones.<br />The entire album is great, but it's the first half that really stands out in my mind. It is pure perfection.Fight Fire With Fire is a perfect opener. After the amusing intro you'll find the fastest, heaviest song Metallica ever did, with some nice soloiong thrown in. Hetfield's vocals are as abrasive as they ever got, and his rhythm work crushes. It simply destroys. Ride the Lightning is great too. It shows the direction Metallica will take on the next 2 albums, as it is longer and more winding than most of the other stuff found here. The chorus is just awesome. For Whom the Bell Tolls is probably the best known song from the album. The introduction is just stunning, and the entire song has a lot of good riffing. Fade to Black is my favorite song from this album, and is certainly one of the best songs Metallica has ever done.(or anyone else has ever done for that matter) The acoustic guitatars are used perfectly, and the instrumental chorus surges with power and emotion. The part that really stands out it is the last few minutes, with stunning soloing from Hammet and an awesome underlying rhythm section. It is almost a perfect song.(Welcome Home and One are even better) The second half isn't as good, but it still rules. Trapped Under Ice picks the pace back up from the 2 slower songs, and is one of the more purely thrash songs on this ablbum. After Escape, which I already discussed, is Creeping Death, which is yet another classic.  The Intro and lead in riff are simply just brutal, and the whole track is brimming with energy and intensity, and has another excellent chorus.(It has some bizarre lyrics, which are about Moses and the Exodus. It doesn't seem to be making any sort of comment on this, just describing it, which is kinda weird) The final track is Call of Ktulu, which is the instrumental from this album. Though I don't like it as much as their other instrumentals, its still very cool, and dark and intense.(The version on S&M is excellent too)<br />So go buy this, and be stunned by it's brilliance.s ever done for that matter) The acoustic guitatars are used perfectly, and the instrumental chorus surges with power and emotion.

0312952813|4.0|This is a good book, but for those of you who will be listening to the Audiobook edition, beware.  The reading is recorded using the left track and right track independently.  You will need to set the balance control first to full left then full right.  In some cars this becomes very hard to hear since it is using half the normal amount of amplification.  This saves money for the publisher, but is not the most pleasant to use.
0385721234|1.0|Unfortuantly this book was not everyone lived it up to be. Very dissapointing, i am reluctant to read another from the same author.
0385335482|5.0|This book is hilarious!  I couldn't put it down, but when I finally did (only because I was forced to by coming to the last page), I immediately started on the sequel 'Shopaholic Takes Manhatten' (and am eagerly awaiting the next installment, 'Shopaholic Ties the Knot')!   Becky Bloomwood spends her way through somewhat implausible, but highly entertaining situations, with her unique Shopaholic attitude, providing page after page of belly laughs.  Sure, her attitude toward bills and money in general is a little scary, but its extremeness is also part of its charm, and provides the impetus for Becky's adventures.  <br />Whether you are a Shopaholic yourself or not, this is a wonderfully fun read, and a way for all of us to see that maybe our own debt situations aren't as bad as they could be!
B00005JKNF|4.0|For those of you who were hoping for a thrilling murder mystery you picked the wrong movie.  Some however continued to watch and were thrilled in a different way by what they saw.<br />Altman's movie is a study is the British class structure, the upstairs and the downstairs, and how they interact and deal with one another.  The movie is told from the point of view of a ladies maid, and the movie concerns itself with the relationships between the hierarchy of the servants, and of the socialites.  Small gossip is passed from level to level,...information is gathered about family and money and smart one liners are traded back and forth.<br />But suddenly murder strikes, the head of the house is poisoned and then stabbed, and the bumbling inspector is brought in.  He is snubbed by the servants, and scorned by their masters, and the murder is left to stand, with nobody caring enough to do or say anything...<br />What is truly great about the movie however, are the characters that it creates, and how they interact with one another.  The movie is brilliantly cast, and the script is very clever.  It reveals everything, not through words, but through glances, gestures, alliances, and feelings.
B00006HBUA|3.0|The key to enjoying SCOOBY DOO is not to expect too much.  The producers have billed the film as half hommage, half parody; in truth, it isn't really close enough to the original cartoon to be called hommage and it really doesn't go far enough to be called parody, and as usual Hollywood makes the mistake of trying to cover up the script's inadequacies with big-budget production values and expensive but actually so-so special effects.  All the same, the film does have its moments.  The story finds Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy splitting up due to ego conflicts--and then being unexpectedly reunited when the owner of a teen resort called &#34;Spooky Island&#34; invites them in to find out why his guests arrive as normal teens and then depart as, well, ZOMBIES.<br /><br />The script is fairly mundane, but it does have a few zingers, as when Velma says &#34;Let's get jinky with it!&#34;  And although the cast is a mixed bag, they work hard to bring it off.  Freddie Prinze is wildly miscast as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar is not an ideal Daphne, but they play with tremendous energy; Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini, however, are so dead on target with their performances that they create an amazing sense of deja vu.  As for Scooby Doo, he is (of course) a computerized animation.  And so are most of the monsters the gang encounters on Spooky Island.  Although it works reasonably well, it isn't anything to write home about.<br /><br />I would recommend that parents preview the film before unleashing it upon their kids; some younger children may be unnerved by the monsters.  The DVD comes with a number of extras that include some cut scenes--and they offer an interesting contrast with the film, for they are very satirical.  Seeing them left me with the feeling that the film would have been much more entertaining if those scenes had been left in and the whole thing had been done with the same bite.  As it is--SCOOBY DOO is neither a great film nor a memorable film.  But we're all occasionally in the mood for some mindless fluff, and it fills that niche very well indeed.<br /><br />GFTally in the mood for some mindless fluff, and it fills that niche very well indeed.

078322737X|5.0|George Lucas's \\"American Graffiti\\", more than any other film, captures what its like to be teetering on the brink of adulthood after school is over.  Steve (Ron Howard) only wants to be with the love of his life, Laurie (Cindy Williams), but almost blows it  with her completely. Her brother Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) isn't sure if he wants to leave for college. He becomes attracted to a blonde (Susanne Summers in a cameo) he briefly sees in a car, but doesn't know who she is. He winds up spending half the night with a street gang (led by Bo Hopkins).   John (Paul LeMatt) loves to race cars, but ends up driving around with an underage girl (Mackenzie Phillips).  Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith) is a nerd trying to impress a girl (Candy Clark, who earned an Oscar nomination) that he's just met. Of course, it ends in disaster.   All of this is observed in a funny, heart-felt way. Memorable moments include Curt's meeting Wolfman Jack, John's ongoing fued with another racer (Harrison Ford in a small part), John and the young girl demoiishing a car with with shaving cream, and Toad's fight with the guys who stole his friend's car.  George Lucas captured it all nicely with a top notch soundtrack of early rock and roll classics in the background, which enhances the period detail.  Nearly the entire cast prticipates in an excellent \\"making of\\" documentary that it is included with the DVD. Lucas and producer Francis Coppola are interviewed as well. The documentary runs about 80 minutes, and everyone involved has an interesting story to tell. It also includes screen tests that were done for some of the cast. It more than makes up for tha lack of any commentary track on this DVD.  This DVD is a worthy purchase for any fan of \\"American Graffiti\\".
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD the week it came out with no prior knowledge of who John Mayer was, or what he sounded like.  It was the best music purchase of the year for me.  With his acoustic sound inspired by greats such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane, Sting and the Police, Dave Mathews Band and more I loved it.  Even if you're not a fan of acoustic rock or jazz, you'll love John Mayer and his unique voice and simple yet cleverly refreshing lyrics.
0792101448|5.0|I just had a brief comment to make about this film.    This movie had a strangely powerful effect on me, which most movies don't, especially considering it was a western, and I had a couple of ideas on that, so I thought I'd mention them here.    I think one thing Leone did was to transform the players in the movie into almost mythical giants. The characters in the movie, good or bad, are bigger than life, and the emphatic way he shot the close-ups of the actors emphasizes the fact that these characters are terrible bringers of destiny, the way the mythical Greek gods were. In that sense, I think Leone doesn't just over-romanticize the Old West as many before him had done--instead, he sees it as a stage of almost mythical proportions on which the forces of Good and Evil fought life and death battles for supremacy.    I'll just mention one other thing. One brilliant move by Leone was casting Henry Fonda, who normally plays good guys, as the treacherous, cold-blooded, and murderous gunslinger, Frank. All the actors turned in outstanding performances in the move, including Bronson, Cardinale, and Robards, but his choice of Fonda for the lead bad guy was truly inspired, since Fonda did a great job in the role.    Overall a great movie, a great western, and a great testament to Leone's inspired vision of this movie, which is perhaps all the more remarkable in that it was not an American but a foreigner who created it and brought it to us.    ***Footnote: I just watched this movie again with a friend, 12 years after writing this review, and it held up very well.
B0000024VP|5.0|Like many releases by British artists in the 60s, there were two versions of this: one UK and one US.  The information I could gather on this is a bit confusing and conflicting.  Piecing together what I found, I offer this to help alleviate (and hopefully not compound) the confusion:  I believe that the version with the song sequence listed on this page is the original US version, released September 1966.  Very early in 1967, shortly before the release of the US \\"Mellow Yellow\\" album, a UK album entitled \\"Sunshine Superman\\" was issued that combined songs from both of these US records.  This UK release omitted \\"Ferris Wheel\\" and \\"Fat Angel\\" and included five songs from the \\"Mellow Yellow\\" LP: \\"The Observation,\\" \\"Writer In The Sun,\\" \\"Hampstead Incident,\\" \\"Sand And Foam\\" and \\"Young Girl Blues.\\"  In any event, the album listed on this page is the one I've had for years, and it's the one I'll review.  (Issued much later were a couple of compilations also called \\"Sunshine Superman.\\"  Don't bother with those.)<br />We begin with \\"Sunshine Superman,\\" which smiles in blurry, dreamy, tropical-beach sunlight while beneath, exotic undercurrents pulsate and groove.  It was released as a single and became the first of many hits.  Next, a fairy tale called \\"Legend Of A Girl Child Linda\\" is presented, complete with a princess.  It teeters for a bit between minor chords before moving to major, giving it sparkle, only to resolve back to minor again.  This progression gives this song the most magical and wistful of moods.  No words can describe how gorgeous it is (nor how enchanting).  The song structure is somewhat unique: there is no chorus or bridge and the verses are separated by short instrumental interludes of tasteful imagination and delicacy.  The percussion here is quite understated, true for the majority of the album.  (This magical album doesn't \\"rock,\\" it meditates.)  Hand drums are used...I believe they're bongos, not tablas.  \\"Legend\\" seemingly lasts forever, but that's not nearly long enough.  As it ends, I sigh....  On to \\"Three King Fishers\\" - another trance-inducing marvel.  The rhythm ceases on the chorus and Donovan's voice, matched by the sitar, embraces an exotic Middle Eastern scale.  (Perhaps the first rock tune ever with this scale?)  Hypnotic.  The sitar twangs gently and beautifully; one of the most peaceful songs I've ever heard.  We've been in a state of nirvana for two songs now, and \\"Ferris Wheel\\" keeps us there. Then comes the cosmically jazzy \\"Burt's Blues,\\" the mystically groovy \\"Seasons Of The Witch\\" and the grooviest of all, \\"The Trip,\\" which shu-shu-shuffles along while Donovan colorfully paints his uniquely psychedelic imagery.  When I haven't listened to this album for a while, I sometimes forget how gorgeous \\"Guinevere\\" is: pensive, dark...haunting beyond belief.  \\"Fat Angel\\" and \\"Celeste\\" are also meditative wonders.  These songs offered the essence of `67 in 1966.<br />Here is an album that fits the bill as one of my favorites, a record that easily falls within my top five of all time.  Donovan, the ever-youthful romantic, was indeed prophetic.  This album, filled with enigmatic innocence, is definitively psychedelic.  And considering that the title track was recorded as early as 1965, we have much to ponder in terms of who really ushered in the psychedelic movement.<br />In light of the wonderful reviews on this page, it should be obvious that the album at hand means a great deal to us.  But through the years, Donovan has been unjustly served by the so-called music critics (the pros who have consistently failed us).  Had these self-professed authorities done their job, there'd be no reason for these customer-review pages other than self-expression.  Donovan was a much-loved artist in the 60s.  In those days, he was respected by oodles of recording artists.  In 1965, Donovan won a Beat Instrumental's Gold Star Award for Best Folk Guitarist, beating out such artists as Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.  There are many people who still love the fabulous and inimitable Donovan.  If you love the music of the 60s (a time when people weren't ashamed of nonviolent emotions), please...please do yourself a favor and get this magical treasure piece. Its inherent spells will never wear off!<br />Cheers,<br />Murrayan.  There are many people who still love the fabulous and inimitable Donovan.

B000002572|3.0|As a pre-teenager, I was very intrigued my the heavy pop sound of Boston. The melody line of More Than A Feeling was very captivating to my ears. In addition, Foreplay/Longtime captivated my soul with the spooky organ intro and powerful vocals. I knew I had to have this record and made the purchase upon accumulating enough money.<br />After a few listens, I really began to like this record a great deal. Enough to warrant purchasing the songbook to work out the melodies on guitar and piano. I really like the enegertic Smokin' especially the way it shifted gears with a mesmerizing organ solo during the middle part of the song.<br />As time went on, Boston always seemed to take an excessive amount of time in releasing follow-up albums. Heck Third Stage took eight years to record. And the truth of the matter is that the band hardly expanded on their sound. As I listened to other artists with greater interest, I somewhat forgot about this once reverred record.<br />I fast forward to today, where I just passed an Amazon.com page listing a soon to be released Boston recording Corporate America. I say to myself, geez haven't these guys taken the hint that their time has passed a LONG TIME ago?<br />Yes, I still like Smokin', Long Time, and a couple of other tracks as well. However, as a forty year old adult, I find that in spite of some pretty good melodies, even this first and best release of Boston has an extremely limited vision. I tend to prefer variety in my music and this was definitely not Boston's strong suit. If you have some nostalgia for Music from 1976, you might want to pick it up. However, essential to one's record collection, this release surely is not.
B00000ILGL|2.0|Giorgio is the father of Techno, no doubt... but the short tracks on this CD were disappointing for the price paid. Not to mention the flat sound quality. Back in those days, long play dance tracks was not the norm for album compilations. Might I suggest that somebody out there pump up and flesh out some of the pieces with their own techno wizardry. There's a lot of potential. It would be a wonderful tribute to Giorgio Moroder.
B00006AW2O|5.0|A nice batch this second release by the Stones.  Much more than three chord rock and the blues.  Time Is On My Side is a soulful gem and I do appreciate the organ driven intro here.  Confessin' The Blues is a hidden gem as the blues rarely has sounded so good.  The cover of Around and Around is another winner with a raunchy fast paced tempo.  Its All Over Now, Empty Heart, and If You Need Me are all other noteworthy tunes.<br />In spite of still doing so many covers, the Stones really developed their sound on this record.  It still stands as a premiere recording.  Pick it up for sure.
0780625854|1.0|First half is a drama, second half is slapstick comedy. Both halves are awful. What are we supposed to make of a movie when the people who made it can't figure out what it's supposed to be. If you want to watch a good drama with Demi Moore try A Few Good Men or G.I. Jane.
0060194995|4.0|To whomever this concerns,<br />I am reading To Kill a Mockingbird in my enlish class and in my opinion, as far as i have read, the book seems suspenseful and entertaining.  One of my favorite parts is when Jem, Scout, and Dill sneak around the Radley's house at night and Jem ends up losing his pants and goes back for them later.  This part kept me on my toes for a while!  What is your favorite part of the book?  I would greatly appreciate it if you would respond to my review.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|I recently picked this up and found it to be overly clever and a clear disappointment. The signs are there...the '79' on the shirt (I get it...it's been a long time since the &quot;Summer of '69&quot; - one of his songs I connect with the most). But ohh, what a down turn in his career. Where is his old style of singing, the way he phrased a song, and where is the pop I love sooo much? Come back, please, give us more songs like the one above. Don't try to be soooo clever, and all will be forgiven.
0312979479|2.0|And Then There Were None was a book that had little interest to me. I love mysteries and trying to solve them along the way, but with this book I soon lost my interest. I have been an Agatha Christie fan for two years now and have to say that I was completely disappointed by the way which this book was written. Not only were there to many characters, but there was also very little description. Which is so unlike Agatha to do. I will continue to be an Agatha fan, but hopefully the next book, which I read will hold my attention a little more.
6304233639|3.0|It's damned clear from the opening shot (the American flag on the moon, Neil Armstrong's \\"one small step speech\\" in the background and the footprints of said astronought and chums) what this is about. Aliens attack the world? Nope. Aliens attack America and get what's coming to them... as if we couldn't guess. Yep, it's that big budget remake of all those B-Movies, with lots of anthems and \\"God bless America\\" moments. For everyone in America, this will doubtless be the feelgood blockbuster of the year... for the rest of the world, it's probably the biggest, most expensive lump of cheese yet concieved in the movie industry.<br />The story is nice and simple. Some shamefully mean and nasty aliens descend from the skies, promptly attacking (curiously we see attacks on America and... well, nowhere else, because of course nowhere else would really matter if it was destroyed) and causing mass destruction. The ramifications of this worldwide devastation are never considered, with a general theme of \\"America will fix it\\" running through. It's jingoistic to sickening extremes, with the President delivering a nice independence day speech and getting in a plane alongside the normal people (for people read Americans) and attacking those nasty aliens with all the American firepower they can muster. Damned inspiring stuff... if you're American.<br />Of course there's the nice touch that Mr. Average, \\"Russell Case\\" (often drunken crop duster who claims to have been abducted by aliens) saves the day with the President nobly paving the way for him. Aw. The whole \\"Pres'-Helps-Save-The-Day\\" thing wouldn't get a full blown movie plot until the equally sickening Air Force One, but here it's a little subplot and still an annoying one. Let's be honest... Presidents are puppets, always out of harm's way, and NEVER likely to get stuck into the action. Now I've had my go at that subject, I'll continue.<br />America of course leads the way in saving the world, showing how to destroy the alienbeasties by bringing down their ships (and, presumably, crushing miles of land beneath, and causing vast dust clouds, similar to an asteroid collision? Oh well). In fact, the only footage of \\"the rest of the world dealing with the problem\\" is a few clips of stereotypical foreigners. For the English we have the likes of \\"crikey, aliens are invading! Better put the kettle on\\" and so forth. Nobody seems to mind that aliens invading the world actually involves the rest of the world. Oh well.<br />Anyway, if you can swallow the absurd jingoism, is it actually a good film? Well, Jeff Goldblum - yet again playing his terminal character, the scatterbrained noble genius, but he does it well and is amusing in all his scenes. Bill Puttman is a questionably brave and strong president, probably ranking above the rest of the rather over-comical cast (Will Smith, love him or hate him, does what he does best - yell, do action scenes and come out with one-liners). And the script, oh the script... cheese left right and centre, with aliens whose motives are as simple and clear cut as the film's intention: to make a LOT of money. Which it shamelessly did.<br />The effects are, of course, grand and good. The flying saucers look far meaner than their wobbly ancestors, and the aliens are just as tenticle-clad and slimy as you'd expect. It's all very predictable, yet pleasing in it's reliability. And of course it's entertaining throughout, delivering nothing but eye-pleasing action and lots of loud noises. Yes, despite it's irritating themes, it's fun.<br />It's well worth the title of blockbuster, and is truly suited to those with brains firmly switched off. So I can watch it and like it if I don't think about it - and some of it's moments (Puttman's speech, from a certain perspective - and Russell Case's delightful final moments: \\"Hello boys, I'm back!\\" and \\"Payback's a b**ch aint it!\\" for example) are touching and funny. So there is definitely fun to be had, and it is, as much as it pains me to say it, definitely worth watching it.<br />For non-Americans it will prove a guilty pleasure, and for those for whom it was made, it will prove a heart-melting flag waver and no mistake. So watch it, laugh at or with it, and enjoy it anyway.
B00004U8JV|4.0|How people can bash this movie is beyond me.  Can you find flaws in the plot line? - yes. Are there occasional inconsistencies? - yes. Are they any worse in this movie than the ones in Star Wars and Indiana Jones - no, and I bet you liked those movies, didn't you? Instead of nitpicking every little thing that Speilberg did wrong, why not take a step back and look at all he did right. This movie has some excellent acting (Goldblum and Postlewaite),a very good story, certainly good enough to string together all the incredible action sequences and movie magic that we're engulfed by throughout the entire film, and it actually pulls off a little moral statement about our society (both the stupidity of some hunters wanting to kill anything they can, and the stupidity of some tree hugging peace-niks that think everything should be saved.) The suspense is there too - I actually jumped out of my seat watching the movie again last night during the raptor/shack scene. People were obviously expecting something else from this movie when they bash it, but what WERE they expecting?!?! This movie has all the coolness of the first film and delivers extra - TWO t-rexes, new dinos, great capture sequence, and the entire SanFran ending is fantastic (who as a child didn't have nightmares that looked EXACTLY like what happened to the little boy?). If this movie had been the first Jurassic Park movie, people wouldn't have enough good things to say about it, and the first one would be a pretty weak follow up - wouldn't it? Take my word for it - this movie is a good time, even though it's the SECOND dinosaur movie to be a good time.
B00005JKDR|5.0|As the parent of three children under the age of 8, I get dragged (usually kicking and screaming) to any of the new kid's movies.  This was one that I initially dreaded going to in the theaters because the title sounded just too kiddy for me.  In the end, I was wrong.  Good quality kids flick with a minimum of adult-aimed-hope-it-goes-over-the-kid's-heads humor.  The snow cone bit was as close as it came.  If the Dreamworks crowd had put it together, I can guarantee that there would have been multiple not so subtle references to the side kick's mono-ocular state of being.<br />From the minute we walked out of the theater we knew that this was a DVD that would be high on the wish list.  We have it and I can assure you that it did not disappoint.  All aspects of the film were outstanding and actually better than our theater experience (which was in a little 150 seat box of a theater in Turkey with projection and sound equipment just barely out of the 50's...)  The only complaint was that the outtakes that appeared during the end credits in the movie were moved to a second DVD.  Keeps the kids entertained and it doesn't drive us crazy.  Good DVD.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Quite possibly THE best sequel of a movie.  Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in his role as the Terminator.  However, this time he's the protector of John Connor (as well as Sarah Conner)<br />  The T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is after John Connor and it's up to Arnold to stop the T-1000 from killing John.  This isn't as easy as it sounds, since the T-1000 is an advanced prototype, even more advance than the old terminator.  However, this doesn't stop the terminator from fighting the T-1000.  The old terminator is torn to pieces, while the T-1000 shows little damage.<br />  The Special Edition has new scenes added, including the first nuclear nightmare.  On the other side of the DVD are other features, like the &quot;making of&quot; special for T2.  All in all, one of the best DVDs!
0380778556|5.0|Great for all ages!  Once you fall in love with the book...see the movie.

B00000K3D4|5.0|\\"Labyrinth\\", directed by Jim Henson, is one of my all-time favorite children's fantasies. It's about teenage aspiring actress, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), who's sick and tired of being mistreated by her parents (Shelley Thompson and Christopher Malcolm) because she thinks her baby brother gets all the attention. Sarah soon begins to hate her baby brother and wishes that he would be taken away by evil goblins. Miraculously, Sarah's wish comes true...but now she's afraid of what might happen to her brother and wants him back. So to get him back, she must embark on a journey through an enchanted labyrinth maze to get her brother back from the evil king goblin (David Bowie). Along the way, she meets many magical creatures and defeats dangerous tasks as she learns what's really important about family.<br />The film's special effects were done by the Lucasfilm company (yes, George Lucas's effects company). The acting is superb from the entire cast, especially a very young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie. The storyline is wonderful, but the DVD is lacking, with only trailers, production notes, and one documentary on the making of the film. \\"Labyrinth\\" might actually not be for all ages, since it can be a little scary...esepcially the goblins might creep some young children out. But it is still a must.<br />I highly recommend \\"Labyrinth\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
B00000FCBC|5.0|this is what all metallica fans have been waiting for years all there b-sides on one album good stuff it covers everything fm garge days re-revisited to new remakes like my favorite whisky in the jar. so i think was an attempt to reasure all true metallica fans the ones have been listening since the 80's that they still play speed metal!
B00006ALGL|5.0|This is one of the best and most original cds I have ever heard, one of those rare albums that can bring tears to your eyes and chills to your spine. I can't compare this music to anyone else's. The usage of classical music and operatic voices, the melodies, and the incredible voices of Damien, and of Lisa Hannigan who joins him on several tracks. It's not often music can be described as beautiful. This is. Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B00003CXI1|4.0|As a single adult with no children I had no idea what the Harry Potter craze was.  Having bought the DVD I now know what the ballyhoo is all about.  I enjoyed it immensely.  A good story, good acting by all (especially the three kids!), and terrific special effects.  The Quidditch game was way cool!  It's a wonderful fantasy film that doesn't make any pretense toward anything else.  It's just fun, and I eagerly await the next installment.
B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate SG-1` is a fine sci-fi series.A take off from the movie Stargate,the series starts where the movie ends.If you liked the movie you'll love the series. I have seasons 1 and 2 in the box set and hope that I won't have to wait until next fall for season 3.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this release. I honestly don't agree with all the DMB comparisons, I think he is closer related to Joe Jackson (especially in his use of melody). Beautiful voice and tuneful songs. And although his lyrics speak more to folks about five years younger than me (I'm 29), I find him refreshingly devoid of hyper-cynicism. How lovely!
0375414053|5.0|It is rare for a book to live up to its hype but this was even better than I expected!  It was so funny, so sad and most of all so true.  Allison Pearson captures the joys and trials of motherhood perfectly.

B00006HBUA|1.0|IT'S THE SPIT IN YOUR FACE MOVIE TO EVERY SCOOBY-DOO FAN ON THIS EARTH
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Some reviewers are mixing this best of set with a greatest hits set. It's true that the 1988 hits CD did not include the top twenty \\"Seven Wonders,\\" but there was little room left on that CD when they added two songs bumped from \\"Tango In The Night.\\" Those two songs (As Long As You Follow and No Questions Ask) appear here too. This two CD set was obviously put together with Lindsey, Mick and Stevie's input. A best of does not necessarily mean that you'll get hits. The draw here is that you will be hearing crystal clear productions and some of the songs sound more alive than ever. \\"Little Lies,\\" the Christine McVie pop masterpiece is gorgeous here, more layered than ever. Speaking of Christine, \\"Over My Head\\" never sounded this good in 1975. Some of my favorites include the little heard 1990 song \\"Skies The Limit,\\" \\"Storms,\\" \\"Paper Dolls\\" from the 1992 four-CD \\"The Chain\\" that nobody heard (only 200,000 copies were produced and now they go for a hundred bucks on eBay) and the biggest surprise of all is the punched up version of Christine McVie's \\"Think About Me,\\" I listened to it in the car about a dozen times just to take it in. Sadly, one of Christine's greatest songs, \\"Heart of Stone\\" from \\"The Chain\\" is missing and many have never heard it, as Warner Brothers never pushed the retrospective as much as it should of. Only on \\"The Chain\\" can you get the extended, mesmerizing \\"Brown Eyes,\\" plus other alternate mixes. Lindsey's \\"Go Insane\\" was a solo hit for him, but the live version from their 1997 \\"The Dance\\" appears here, it's a good song and this version draws you in. Too bad there's only 36 songs, as a true FM best of would be at least 100 songs. We're lucky, the UK version has only 21 songs and includes pre Stevie/Lindsey material. All in all, get this CD, the crisp production and alternate mixes (some radio mixes) are worth it...you'll be listening to it until at least April when their new 2003 studio record is released.  Lastly, the only \\"too bads\\" are that Fireflies, Farmer's Daughter and all of the Christine McVie songs from \\"Time\\" are missing.
B000056K04|5.0|I am a long-time Dave listener.  Their first three studio albums were absolutely amazing.  Then, three years after \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\" they throw a CD at us with a new producer, new songs (they scrapped Lillywhite Sessions, only to put it out reworked as Busted Stuff, later) and totally new Dave.  The first tiem I heard it, I was dissapointed.  The only two songs I liked were \\"Everyday\\" and \\"When the World Ends.\\"  They had changed from their sweeping epics and made them shorter, popier, and even \\"When the World Ends\\" was cut short, as if they made a point not to make a long song on the CD, just as it began having potential.  Several days later, I gave it a second try, and it began to grow on me.  On \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\" Dave's lyrics touched a darker, more important side.  What happened on \\"Everyday\\" is as follows.  Dave went through a hard period in his life.  His lyrics grew darker, his songs more complex.  People have said that Dave went pop, and he did.  This is a pop CD.  But I have never seen a pop CD with lyrics quite like this CD's.  <BR>Now I have to tell you why I rated it like I did.  As a Dave CD, it would have gotten three stars.  There are some very good songs on the CD.  As a pop CD, it gets five stars.  I know that's not a perfect average, but hey, shoot me.  I think this CD shows artist maturation, even if it isn't what fans are used to.  It made a lot of money, and even introduced new fans to Dave.  I got a friend of mine hooked on old Dave after she liked this CD.  Hey, it's not perfect, but you've got to give the artists credit.  The band is truly talneted (even though Leroi is practically cut out of the CD) and Glan Ballard did make a flawless pop CD.  <BR>Just as a note, if this CD weren't DAve, I probably wouldn't like it too much, but standing alone it is a good CD.  Standing with other Dave CD's, it barely scratches the surface of who DAve really is.  I can't wait for their new live CD, just to see how he worked these short songs into their typically great shows.  It should be interesting. <BR>All in all, it is worth listening to for a new listener, and it is worth a second, third, fourth (and on and on) listening by long-time DAve fans like myself, becuase it isn't as bad as it seems at first.
B00006DEF9|5.0|So many films in my collection are &quot;important&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;disturbing&quot;, or &quot;great&quot;, and as much as I treasure them (films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Ran), there is only so much self-importance a person can take before the pores fairly scream out for something just plain fun;  something slight, buoyant, silly, and full of energy.  Singin' in the Rain is just that kind of movie.  The funny part is, I generally HATE musicals!<br />In 1951, Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen took a collection of songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown and - assisted by a pitch-perfect screenplay from the writing team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden - sculpted one of the great classic fusions of popular cinematic art and precision dance craft.  It is the Citizen Kane of musicals: a virtual catalog of musical film technique, executed flawlessly.<br />But that alone would not be enough to separate Singin' in the Rain from the kind of musical I can't stand (which is to say, just about every other musical ever made).  No, what makes this one special is that it knows what it is and celebrates it.  It never for a moment asks you to forget you're watching a movie and then grinds to a screeching halt for the musical number.  Instead, it deconstructs itself before your very eyes (and ears) as a razor-sharp, self-aware satire of the movie industry - as well as a joyous expression of the pure ecstasy of great song and dance.  In that sense, it is one of the few so-called musicals that actually achieves a genuine symbiosis of drama, music, and kinetic performance art.<br />If all this sounds rather gushing and pretentious, so be it.  This is great film-making.  It is Rolex Oyster Perpetual film-making.  This DVD edition sparkles with ultra-saturated colors, digitally remixed Dolby 5.1 sound, and some terrific extras (even if you're not particularly into musicals).<br />My favorite sequence is the eerily fluid dance work between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse against a Dali-esque background near the end of the film.  Charisse is spellbinding as she trails a gravity-defying veil that must be 30 feet long.  It hangs in the air, suspended by wind machines as she uses her extraordinary dance skill (and fantastic legs) to affect a wordless seduction of Kelly's naive, love-struck hero.  Great stuff.<br />Even if you don't think of yourself as the &quot;musical type&quot;, give Singin' in the Rain a try.  After all that heavy, bitter, existential cinema, it makes one helluva fine dessert.e against a Dali-esque background near the end of the film.

B00005R87Q|3.0|Well, the movie wasn't that big of a deal. It was spectacular, and I can see how people into cars really dug the machines and the whole styled up world of \\"rice-rockets\\", but as a movie, it was rather lame. The plot is rather easy to figure out (even though the twist got me tricked for a moment), so it's not gonna strain your brain to watch it. The visuals will be nice too, and there are a couple of good special effects. The acting is average though, and the directing didn't make for a landmark piece of movie history either. Paul Walker, the main character especially misses one thing: and that is a character. Vin Diesel on the other hand sparkles. I used to hate him, and never understand what people adored about him, but after watching this flick, I join what one character says in the film: the movie gravitates around him. It reminds me of Schwarzenegger in \\"Terminator\\". Michael Biehn is gone, but Schwarzi stayed. Same thing here (I guess, that's why some refer to him, as the new Schwarzi). Walker never had a chance against his presence on the screen. Neither did the others -- they all just fade away. Not to say that they ever would go beyond two dimensions, but some of them do make an effort at least...<BR>The other thing to watch out for, which might raise one's appreciation for the movie is to think of it as following the cowboy-genre traditions. This might help you to understand a couple of motivations and behavioral patterns better. It amde me think quite differently. But all in all, the movie was average. Or maybe I expected something better. All in all, they could have put more close-ups of the exteriors and interiors of the cars in them -- just to give a better taste -- and more action scenes with cars (surprisingly little of that).<BR>However, the DVD is a good job. Pumped full of (good, quality) extras, it is a piece to own. And the director's commentary is also very informative, and helps one understand quite a bit about movie-making in general and the making of this specific movie.<BR>So, if you liked the movie -- get it! If you didn't -- rent it! It's worth checking out!
B000001ESP|5.0|This is one of the greatest heavy metal records in history. If any part of you feels that Rush is not on the level of bands like Led Zeppelin, listen to this album. They are the greatest hard rock band to ever come out of Canada, and their have been quite a few decent Canadian bands. A must for any heavy metal collection!
B00006J3WH|5.0|I don't watch Buffy.  I never have....until I heard there was gonna be a musical episode.  I was blown away!  As a big fan of musicals, this one is DAMN good.  The vocals are great for a cast that doesn't sing and the songs are perfectly written.  I wish there were a DVD of the episode to go with this album.  Tracks that stand out are &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;, with a Sarah MacLachlan-ish sound to it, &quot;Through The Fire&quot; which is one of the best ensemble pieces I've heard, and &quot;Rest In Peace&quot; which truly shines.  If you like musicals, then you should definitely get this one!
0671781383|5.0|This book is great for two reasons.<BR>1. Everybody knows of the horrors of the holocaust. We all know of the physical trauma and fear felt by all of the prisoners. We can't truly know all of the hurt done. This book doesn't go into the horrible details, but into the mind of a prisoner. There had to have been absolute trauma knowing one was a moment away from death. In this book, however, Viktor E. Frankl tells how the prisoners mentally survived. It was through a collective will to get through each passing day. One story tells how one person lost the will to live it was obvious that they weren't going to live. The going into of an individuals mind through the holocaust and the different perspective of horrors make this a great book.<BR>2. It offers principles and help to find meaning in life. Frankl's logo therapy is one way he identifies to help people examine his/her life. One doesn't need to have his logo therapy but identify principles in the book to help find meaning. The principle taught that one must make the best of whatever situation is present in life. He was in the holocaust and managed to survive.

0790729687|1.0|\\"Interview with a Vampire\\" commits two fundamental errors, irredeemable in the horror genre:<br />1) It demystifies vampires. Vampires are scary because they are enigmatic. They have proved such an enduring icon of horror movies because their lifestyle appears glamorous. They lurk around the fringes of the frame, never wholly revealed, because revelation is inherently anticlimatic. <br />2) It domesticates vampires. The first offence might have been forgiven, had the scriptwriter granted vampires an exciting, erotic existence. Instead, he humanizes vampires by placing them in a domestic context. This, he seems to believe, will elucide the moral dilemma of vampirism. On the contrary, it renders the whole subject so mundane as to be boring.<br />Oh yer, this review would not be complete without noting that this film is ridiculously verbose and pretentious. Not only are we subjected to boring, domesticated, demystified vampires, but we have to endure their irritating existence for over two whole hours - inexcusable, to say the least. And the whole costume drama side is just so incongruous, it's farcical. And why did we ever need to go to Paris - isn't New Orleans atmospheric enough!!! Cheap directorial stunts like this attempt to cover up serious gaps in plot. And what is the plot of this ridiculous enterprise, anyway - there is no message, other than vampirism is morally bankrupt, yet inexorably attractive! I could get that from Blade, which was a far more entertaining film!<br />Sorry to subject you to this rant, but just writing this i am continually reminded about how much i objected to this film. Unless your tastes are more towards homoeroticism - which is replete is this movie - stay away from this poor excuse for horror/drama!
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is the best amongst all other DT's other albums!<BR>I would give it 6 stars if I only could!<BR>I even purchased the DVD (live scenes from NY), which<BR>makes the whole experience even more powerfull!

B00005YXZH|5.0|I have bought Wilco and Son Volt recordings in the past, but none prepared me for the complex, tuneful fun that this CD provides.  Mixed so that mellow, intense songs alternate with more upbeat, pop-oriented singles, the albums gives more with each listening-to.  I recently did a lot of painting and this was a CD I would continue to replay, enjoying a new song more each listen.
B0000256VK|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums period, as someone who grew up listening to Stevie Wonder , Funkadelic, Marvin Gaye and various other R&B and soul groups.As I grew older I also started listening to nu wave, rock and other musical styles,one of the groups i fell into was Roxy Music, and even though i love all of their albums the latter period is one of my favorites from Siren to Avalon this was not bad as many of their critics point out but a period of growth, as soulfunk noticed this is an art- rock band experimenting with many forms from samba,alternative,and disco but with an R&B pallet instead of what most Roxy Fans would look to glam was dead and if Bowie could use black music as a base for futhering his sound why not Ferry. Manzanera and Mackay play with subtle beauty From the interlocking guitars that charcterize most funk and soul groups from 1960 til about 1986 to the passionate vocals from Ferry there is not a weak song on this platter seductive like Marvin Gaye's \\" I Want You\\" album from 1976 this is one beautiful swan song.
B00003W8NM|5.0|...do *NOT* talk about Fight Club. Well, I'm sorry, I have to.<br />As we open Fight Club, we're introduced to our un-named narrator, played by Edward Norton. The Narrator is going through life as it is scheduled, nothing out of the ordinary except for his long, insomnia-ridden sleepless nights. He stays awake looking through endless magazines and infomercials looking for those special possesions that will make his life complete. Then, by chance, he realizes something:<br />If he attends support groups (for which he doesn't really have the problems), he can find inner peace, and sleep at night. He joins every group he can find, and sleeps like a baby. His life is going perfect, until Marla. She was also a tourist, going to every group for whatever reason. Our Narrator can find no peace with another faker present, and so his life falls to shambles again. Then, he meets Tyler Durden, whose conversation style and way of taking what he wants is fascinating to Edward Norton's character. Durden and the Narrater find a new form of entertainment to fulfill their lives, they fight. Men watch them, and they fight too. Soon enough, it becomes a weekly meeting (or... beating) in a local bar's basement.<br />Everything is going great in life. And then, Marla screws our Narrator again. She and Tyler fall into an affair which affects everything our Narrator knows, including their Fight Club. It grows into a national cult, and spirals out of his control, leading to a climax you won't believe, and you'll have to watch the film again and again to understand.<br />---<br />A great modern film from the director of the astonishing Se7en, Fight Club is a love or hate film. It's definitely a must-see at least once for everyone, as it is filled with action, dark humor, and suspense. Great acting from both Norton and Pitt, as well as several supporting actors. Beware if you're faint of heart of stomach, some of the fights are brutal...<br />... but so is the mindf--- you'll experience fromwatching this flick.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I may have been a bit hasty when calling the White Stripes' White Blood Cells the best of the new rock n' roll reemergence.  Just a little while after I was stunned by them, someone recommended that I listen to Whatever Happened to My Rock and Roll by BRMC.  To quote this person's exact words &quot;they make the White Stripes look like Nysnc&quot;.  That is certainly too strong of a statement, but after listening to many of their songs, I came to the conclusion that Black Rebel Motorcycle Club is definitely better, and I bought their album the next day.  <br />B.R.M.C covers a wide variety of music genres in it's 11 tracks, from psychedelia to punk to grunge, but all of the genres are tempered with the distinctive BRMC sound.  The lyrics leave little to criticize as well.  My personal favorite lyric is the end of White Palms when he quietly sings &quot;I wouldn't come back/if I had been Jesus/I'm the kind of guy who leaves the scene of a crime&quot;.  I'm still wondering what exactly he may be implying by that, and that is the kind of thing lyrics should do!  Make you think!  Like I said about White Blood Cells, you will find no whiney &quot;Mommy and Daddy didn't love me&quot; over-used, unimaginative teen angst lyrics here.  <br />BRMC will be liked by many people.  Fans of everyone from Nirvana to The Rolling Stones will like this.  Rock and Roll will not be saved by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, nor any single band.  But I can only hope that the current rash of rock bands continues to become more popular and get more and more airplay, to drown out the stuff that is passing for music these days.  Buy this album, and YOU will be helping save rock and roll.

B00005K3OT|5.0|CHOCOLAT is a movie that warms the heart. It has a mystical feeling about it that is generated by the incredible performance of Juliette Binoche (Wuthering Heights, Blue) and the fictional village where her character creates a chocolate shop of magic in a small European town.<br />It has warmth about the relationship of a strained mother and daughter who spend their time moving from town to town trying to set up shop. A Chocolate shop it was directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Shipping News, The Cider House Rules) who masterfully makes you, the audience, a part of this film. From the evil towns would be \\"Mayor\\" to the towns very own \\"Mistress\\" - it has something for everyone to talk about.<br />This film is soft to the touch and has an incredible amount of humor in it. Including the concept that chocolate is an aphrodisiac. They play that to the hilt. Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hallow) plays the love interest who is the stranger from out of town who is also the bad boy. There is a woman in the story cleverly played by Judy Dench (Shakespeare In Love, Elizabeth, the 4 James Bond movies) who is old and doing everything she isn't supposed and teaches the lessons of life, love and enjoying yourself. It comes at a high price for her in the end.<br />The story is fun energetic and it is photographed extremely well. It was a charm about it that makes you want chocolate but more, importantly, want to enjoy it to its fullest. The DVD extras include a really good commentary and real detailed documentary on making this fictional town seem very real. This is a good film for the whole family. It has a good simple story and a lot of passion. Just a good feeling type of film...
0688170528|5.0|I read Plain Truth and loved it so I was excited to read more of Picoult's work. I was not disappointed. This book was so engrossing that I had a hard time putting it down. The story opens with one teenager dead of a gunshot wound to the head, and another charged with her murder. The twist comes in the fact that  the two were not only boyfriend/girlfriend, but had grown up together since birth. Chris, the boyfriend, claims that he and Emily (the deceased girlfriend)had a suicide pact that went wrong. The reader is constantly in doubt as to whether Chris is telling the truth or not. In flashbacks one sees how Chris and Emily's relationship develops, and also how she became suicidal without her parents, friends, or teachers knowing. Deeply moving, the reader will be left to question whether Chris really did murder Emily, or if she did it herself. It also asks the question, \\"What would you do for love?\\"
B00003CXAE|5.0|GREASE was directed by Randall Kleiser (The Blue Lagoon, Honey, I Blew Up The Kids) as an attempt to revive the old Movie Musical format. It was a great success on Broadway and it wasn't until Paramount Pictures took on the challenge before anyone realized the movie musical, if done right, could be a great success.<br />This movie has the best casting around at the time. John Travolta (Saturday Night Fever, Face Off, Pulp Fiction) and Olivia Newton John (Two Of A Kind, Xanadu) as Danny and Sandy trying to make their senior year in high school the best it could be after spending a summer together falling in love. The trials and tribulations of high school, graduating, rivals gangs and sexual advances all in the 1950's - a time of music and passion and a lot of simple things.<br />Great costuming, great musical arrangements and the best part for me was the choreography. Staying true the tradition of musical theatre, the dance numbers where fun and energetic and simply the best for a modern day musical on the screen. Such hits came from his movie like the title track itself GREASE (written by Barry Gibb), You're The One That I Want and Hopelessly Devoted to You are a few that made the pop charts back in 1978.<br />Great supporting cast members and some incredible performances by Jeff Conoway (Taxi, Babylon Five-TV,  Man On The Moon) Didi Conn (Violet, Grease 2) , Michael Tucci (The Garry Shandling Show, Blow) , Sid Caeser (Your Show Of Shows-TV, Grease 2, Vegas Vacation), Eve Arden (Under The Rainbow, Grease 2) and the best of them all Miss Stockard Channing (The First Wives Club, The West Wing -TV). Her performance as Rizzo could never be matched.<br />This movie is fun for everyone and whole family and will keep your toes tapping and the tunes humming long after you see it. The DVD extras include and anniversary celebration for the movie as well as a retrospective on what it took to make this thing happen. According to them it was a joy of joys to work and even more fun to watch over and over. (10-27-02)fun to watch over and over. (10-27-02)
B00002E224|5.0|i stumbled across this film by accident. just split up with boyfriend and needed a night in with pizza and video. i love Ethan Hawke and just decided to rent this. i was blown away by the thought provoking conversations and easy but believable relationship created by Ethan and Julie (Delpy.) the film is an intelligent insight into two peoples opinions and ideas. yet although the relationship and the discussions are the main content of the film i found myself transfixed till the end. i always promised the next guy i went out with had to appreciate this film as it is easily my favourite. thankfully he does!
B00004R9A4|5.0|BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSICKS was made in the early 70's and is one of those Disney films that speaks to the little kid in us all. Directed by veteran Disney director Robert Stevenson (Mary Pippins, The Love Bug, The Darn Cat ) and starring the incomparable Angela Landsbury (Murder She Wrote, Mame - on Broadway, The Last Unicorn 2004) as Miss Elglentine Price the apprentice witch of the Professor Emiliace Brown School Of Witchcraft - played none other by veteran Disney character performer/actor David Tomlinson (Tom Jones, The Love Bug, Made In Heaven). There is even a great performance in a small role as a priest by Roddy McDowell (Planet Of The Apes, Cleopatra, Fright Night)<br />The story is set in the early days of the German attack on the European border. Towns were broken down, families were separated and displaced and many people had to go to war and leave their children behind. One set of  these children were orphaned with Miss Price. Accidentally discovering her secret  they convince her to go on her quest to find the one last spell that will save England from attack.<br />There is magic, music and lot of special effects that make this movie colorful and enticing to watch. Back in the days when most special effects were real and done \\"in cameras\\" - meaning on the set - this film has a lot to be proud of.<br />The songs are fantastic and this FULLY RESTORED DVD is the best it has to offer. Included the full versions of songs like Portabello Road and reinserted songs like No One To Come Home To has made this version a treasure to own. Other fantastic numbers like Substitutiary Locomotion and Under The Briny Sea are fantastic and hitting home for kids is the Academy Award Nominated song Your At The Age Of Not Believing.<br />Originally rushed out and thought to be too long - this version contains the full - over two hours - theatrical release as it was originally intended. The DVD extras include a documentary  retrospective with co-host Angela Landsbury on the Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins,  ) themselves and a look at some of the actual recording sessions with David Tomlinson.

B00005ONMJ|5.0|Those who owned the first muddied, dark and blurry VHS print of this on VAI will be shocked but pleased (as I certainly was) to discover that this pristine copy on Deutsche Grammophon DVD is almost a different film. The VHS release had one thinking that the concept was of the opera as being set perpetually at night; here on the DVD we see day and night scenes. Plus, colors are vivid, faces are clear, and all looks clean and fresh.<br /><br />The performance is a mixed bag though. Furtw&auml;ngler is possibly the wrongest conductor of Mozart as can be, as evidenced by his dirge-like tempi, sludgy textures and Mahlerian heaviness. The value in this film comes in seeing the performers captured - rarely, as it turns out - as they were in their heyday, and pretty close to their prime. In some aspects there is only historical value, as in the case of the Donna Elvira, Lisa Della Casa, who is otherwise photogenic and voluptuous. Tonally though, she is white sounding and \\"tubular\\" in vocal production, which after a fashion creates a sense of monotony, despite her committed performance. Then there's Erna Berger, perennially touted in this role as being vocally well-preserved and fresh of voice. I hear a nasality and spinsterish tone, and as far as the performance goes, the results here are of a matronly, sexless Zerlina, where the attempt at girlishness is arch, coy and downright embarrassing. Otto Edelmann's very German, very broadly played Leporello doesn't match Siepi's very Italian, very subtle Giovanni.<br />Much better is the young Walter Berry as Masetto, masculine and firm in tone; and Anton Dermota as Ottavio, not ideally fluent but sweet in voice and certainly one of the best tenors in the role to be had at the time.<br />Elisabeth Gr&uuml;mmer is a spontaneous, emotionally appealing Donna Anna. Gr&uuml;mmer had the ability to project a very feminine sincerity, and her singing and acting always had a from-the-heart manner which made her an outstanding artist and personality.  Her singing is admirably precise, the tone steady and which peals forth with shining clarity, with its unique timbral \\"tear\\".<br />That leaves Siepi, perhaps the most memorable and natural Don Giovanni of the last 50 years.  He has everything for the role: elegant dash, rakish charm, dark, romantic matinee-idol looks, athletic physique, a careless savoir-faire, and not least, a golden, suavely beautiful tone.  Siepi has a way of moulding a line which can depict an ardent kind of romanticism and elegance that befits the character; he sees Giovanni as a hedonistic charmer who has a fatal lack of concern for the feelings of others. Of course, when his irresponsible behavior finally catches up with him and Hell beckons, Siepi has no trouble whatsoever in conveying Giovanni's fright as he's being dragged down to the subterranean depths of Devil Land. Siepi is frighteningly intense here, and really does sound like a man scared out of his wits. It's a eerie, effective sequence.<br />How fortunate that Siepi was caught in a role which he practically owned during his career, and which was a hard act to follow - which this release certainly proves.y.

B00006DEF9|5.0|SINGING IN THE RAIN is one of those classic movies made in 1952 that showcase the talents of Gene Kelly (Briggedoon, Anchors Away) and Donald O'Connor (Out To Sea, Ragtime, Francis The Talking Mule ). It also introduces us to the newly discovered talents of then 19-year-old Debbie Reynolds (In And Out, The Bodyguard). The concept of the film was difficult to create but the idea was to get all of Arthur Freeds songs in the movie from the early 20's and 30's. No simple task since there were many.<br />Directed by Gene (also directed Hello Dolly, Giget) himself and Stanley Donen (Kissmet, Funny Face, The Pajama Game) the movie tells the tale of how one movie star became what he is and mad e the transition from Silent Films to talking pictures back in the 1920's. Comically filled with moments of fun, energy and magic this movie has whimsical musical numbers and the most sophisticated and visually dynamic dance choreography around. Staged and designed by Gene again and the newly discover choreographer Michael Kid ( )  - the number s are amazing to watch.<br />The numbers are all toe tapping and memorable and the title song and it's sequence are magical to watch. Who hasn't, at one time or another, tried to imitate Gene when they were out in the rain all by themselves? (Be honest!) This is a classic film, with a classic cast and classic songs to go with it. By far it ranks #1 next to films like Royal Wedding, Wizard Of Oz, An American In Paris, On The Town, Anchor's Away and even  the modern day Grease. This is a fantastically entertaining movie. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are the best they could ever be in this film.<br />Most of the credit of the goes to the movie mogel Arthur Freed who ended up having all of his songs being put in the film and the producer of this film and others like Gidet, Briggadoon and The Wizard Of Oz.<br />The DVD extras are incredible hours of commentary and documentaries with the cast and crew and all the talents from design to orchestration are on this DVD. You'll have hours and hours of history to watch on this one. My only regret is that I wish it were Widescreened or Letterboxed version. I always wondered what I was missing on the small screen.

B00005JK8K|4.0|Like so many endeavors by American Indians,this was badly hurt by  good intentions from the uninformed. Many critics panned it because it was too much the story of Nicolas Cage's character, and not enough about the Navajo Code Talkers.  This, they seemed to assume, was taking advantage of the \\"poor Native Americans\\" who couldn't look out for themselves. They also criticized the many war movie cliches.<br />However, if critics had taken the time to read American Indian publications prior to the movie's release, they would have realized that most American Indian groups were pleased with the movie, taking the much more pragmatic approach that this was a step toward mainstream appreciation of Native American themes and actors, that couldn't be acheived without a big name star and a popular genre.<br />I would agree, that for my purposes, there was too much about the Cage character, but how many other folks would go to see Adam Beach and Roger Willy playing Navajo Code Talkers. As to being cliche, sure it was, in parts, but if you squeamishly skipped over the first scenes of \\"Private Ryan,\\" as I did, you'd notice that that movie had a lot of cliches too. I think the Native American themes and actors were as much a redeeming factor for this movie as the beach landing was for Private Ryan.<br />As for the details, Nicolas Cage did what he's been doing a lot of lately.  He walked through his part. To his credit,he probably realizes that his role is simply to get people in to see movies they would normally ignore, It's a shame it didn't work here. <br />Adam Beach is a creditable actor (though I thought he was better in Smoke Signals) and has a smile to die for. With a little more exposure this guy could be another Tom Cruise. <br />By far the best job, though, was done by Roger Willie, a fellow who never acted before, and went to the auditions on a whim, at the suggestion of his sister-in-law. Willy brings a natural quality to the role that I hope leads to bigger and betterparts in the future<br />The movie does move a little too fast over what I thought were the more interesting issues, like what motivated these two characters to volunteer. I would have liked a little more of their home life and also some more detailed scenes of their training. <br /> A WWII movie without cliches is like a Western without horses and guns, but I thought the Native American themes of ceremonial healing and the warrior past, along with some good acting by the American Indian actors, made this worth seeing. And if more people had gone to see this \\"hybrid\\" of Native American and classic WWII themes, it might have opened a door for more popular acceptence of American Indian actors and movies.
B000058983|4.0|Few things tickle a critical music listener's fancy like being among the select few to be in on an overlooked rock classic.  Love, like Big Star, Nick Drake and Shuggie Otis are one of the great acts that due to happenstance have flown under the collective radar of millions and reluctantly, granted the true audiophile this pleasure.<br />Forever Changes only just appeared on my scopes.  It is of course a delightful pyschadelic wonder.  Each song has a pastoral quality that succeeds in transporting the listener out of mind into a trancelike state.  It is consistant throughout.  It reminds me of the Byrds but doesn't really sound like them.  I can hear Love's influence in a lot of the bands I love today, Belle &amp; Sebastian being among the most obvious.<br />Shuggie and Drake have recently seen their music discovered by larger audiences and maybe Love will too.  Part of me, and you too probably, hopes they don't.<br />(After reading one reviewer recommend against this reissue due to the bass being to high in the mix, I tried desperately to find the original pressing.  I failed but decided that my adjustment of the equalizer would have to do.  I don't have the original to compare it to, but i am satisfied with the reissue.  The liner notes are excellant.)
B00005JLKB|5.0|My nephew is only two and already he knows who Superman is, I am 27 and my father is 57 and we both still love superman and his story, so it shows how much impact this icon has on all Generations.  Smallville doesn't always stay close to the true  story, but between the good humour, great acting and fantastic special effects this program just blows everything else away.  It's great to see Clark coming to grip with his powers for the first time like walking down the street and seeing everyone as a skeleton due to x-ray vision.  Also unlike a lot of other superhero programs like wonder woman, The Hulk, The Flash or  Batman, Clark faces off against enemies with powers like iceman, a guy with agility and strength of a spider (ring any bells) as well as mortal eniemes such as a reporter who is trying to find the true secret.  At first i didn't think having a good Lex Luthor would work but again watching him grow closer, each episode, to the character in the comic is interesting and at time intimidating to watch, the guy who acts this part is fantastic.  Kristen Kreuk is beautiful and Smallville is worth getting if only for the part when she's in the changing rooms and Clark is trying to get use to having x-ray vision. I enjoy Buffy and didn't think anything could take it's place but Smallville has even put this in the shade.  I would recommend Smallville to every generation.

B00004XONN|4.0|This album has much in common with Amnesiac.  Though it is as if it is an unfinished version of Amnesiac.  I don't understand why many people think it is better than Amnesiac, because I don't see why.  It doesn't have much to it, except some music backrounds simular to Amnesiac.  The Morning Bell song on this album is not as good as the one on Amnesiac, either.  This album plays out like blueprints of Amnesiac, or some sketches of it, and is only unfinished and not as organized or flawless.  I strongly recommend buying Amnesiac over this one, it is lyrically, vocally, and musically superior to Kid A.  It is still good though, just a slightly disapointing when compared to Amnesiac.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I watched this last night with my 2 daughters. We all loved it! I thought the actresses both young and old were wonderful, and the story was great. It is a lost way of life, where kids could roam the town and neighborhoods without fear of abduction or the local curfew. I thought it was a great look back, or at least the way you would have liked your own growing up years to be. And who wouldn't have liked to have a group of 4 girls that got along so great, that are still in grown up years best buddies? It just does not get much better than this.<BR>I will be purchasing this asap for our video library.
0812550757|4.0|There's no way to write about \\"Speaker\\" without mentioning \\"Ender's game\\". Although OS Card, in his personal comments always says \\"Speaker\\" was the story he imagined as his \\"opera prima\\", and \\"Ender's game\\" was just an introduction, a short story, in my opinion those roles were reverted. \\"Ender's game\\" is science fiction at its prime, fast paced, interesting characters and situations. \\"Speaker for the dead\\", although using the same main character, is totaly different, mostly in its rhythm and in its purposal.<br />Lusitania is the only of the 100 human-colonized worlds where Man has found another intelligent species. The \\"piggies\\" or Little Ones, as they are called, are way down in the technological scale, and the Starways Congress has a very strict set of rules to deal with the Little Ones, after the disastrous first encounter of Humans - Alien Species, described in the war against the Buggers in \\"Ender's game\\".<br />\\"Speaker\\" is set three thousand years after \\"Ender's game\\". \\"Ender\\" is a forbidden word, related to xenocide, something humanity must avoid commiting a second time. Nobody knows that Andrew Wiggin is the original Xenocide and the original Speaker for the Dead. Traveling among the colonized worlds, he is able to live three milleniums because of Relativity.<br />\\"Speaker for the dead\\" deals with the main families and people of Lusitania, a world colonized by catholic brazilians. There, the zenadores and xenobiologists must deal with the Little Ones, and these functions are passed through the families, father to son. But the two main families, Pipo's and Novinha's have conturbed lives. And it is in the middle of these troubled times that Ender, the Speaker for the dead, is called to speak the death of the first Zenador, Pipo, tragically murdered by the Little Ones. Ender has a new chance to combine humanity and a new sentient species.<br />Although an interesting story, those who liked \\"Ender's game\\" will not accept at first the radical change of style Card goes through. \\"Speaker for the dead\\" has not the allucinating chapters and battles, and sometimes the story just drags on. This is, though, a very beautiful and well-though story. I will read \\"Xenocide\\", no doubt about it. I think that books should be rated by the story they contain alone, no comparison to other books. But in this case I will make an exception, and rate this one within the series (compared to \\"Ender's game\\"). That's why I gave it 4 stars.<br />Just another thing: \\"Speaker for the dead\\" is set in Lusitania, a portuguese-speaking world. Being from Brazil, and a portuguese speaker, I know how difficul it is for an english-speaking person to learn and understand portuguese, since it's a very complex language, one of the most complex of the latin languages. Card does a good job in trying to explain the basics of portuguese in the introduction of the book, though there are some serious mistakes in pronunciation and writing. There are some mistakes in the names of some of the characters, mainly the name of the Mayor of Lusitania: Faria Lima Maria do Bosque. \\"Faria Lima\\" is a compose last name, and \\"Maria\\" a first name. I think this is not an intentional mistake; the correct name should be Maria Faria Lima do Bosque. Card is right to give nicknames to his lusitanian characters, since in Brazil and also in Portugal it is a common practice. There are other minor mistakes regarding portuguese language and brazilian culture. But the major mistake is this: in one of the first pages, Card says that the habitants of Lusitania are \\"brazilian by culture\\". Well if they are brazilian, they would NEVER name their planet after Portugal's historical name. We brazilians have strong cultural and historical bonds with our ancient colonizers, but to name a planet with such a Portugal-reminding word is something brazilians would never do.<br />Grade 8.3/10e Card goes through. \\"Speaker for the dead\\" has not the allucinating chapters and battles, and sometimes the story just drags on. This is, though, a very beautiful and well-though story. I will read \\"Xenocide\\", no doubt about it. I think that books should be rated by the story they contain alone, no comparison to other books. But in this case I will make an exception, and rate this one within the series (compared to \\"Ender's game\\"). That's why I gave it 4 stars.<br />Just another thing: \\"Speaker for the dead\\" is set in Lusitania, a portuguese-speaking world. Being from Brazil, and a portuguese speaker, I know how difficul it is for an english-speaking person to learn and understand portuguese, since it's a very complex language, one of the most complex of the latin languages.

0316666343|3.0|The theme of a dead girl looking down on her family and friends isn't a new one, for so did Emily in \\"Our Town\\",  a play that Sebold even mentions in Lovely Bones. Sebold reworks the subject by having the girl, Susie Salmon, the victim of a violent crime that remains unsolved.<br />From Susie's unique perspective in a heaven \\"where nothing changes and everything is like yesterday\\", Susie looks down upon her family. She watches the anguish of each family member, as they search for ways to deal with their grief. Most memorable is the mother, Abigail, whose overwhelming sense of denial about the murder sends her away from husband and children, as she lives in solitude and loneliness. But the husband and father, Jack, refuses to release his first-born child to memory and keeps her close in the secret chambers of his wounded heart. He comforts himself by nurturing the intuition that Susie is still present.<br />Sebold is gentle with her characters, perhaps too gentle, peeling away the layers of a family bound by love and loss, exposed to the harsh reality of Fate's implacability. Most painful to watch are the devastated parents, whose pain sends them spinning in opposite directions, where they are unable to heal themselves, let alone one another. There is one scene at the end, involving Susie's would-have-been-first-boyfriend, so unbelievable that the story becomes a fantasy. This novel may be most appreciated by a young audience, who may require less emotional depth than drama and romance. For Susie is imbued with the naivete of adolescence, caught forever in the conundrum of innocence betrayed.
B00006AW2E|4.0|This album was the Stones' third in the UK and, I would say, it very much marks the end of their first period while pointing ahead to the fuller joys of albums like Aftermath. The CD release, in mono, is an improvement on the electronically created stereo of the Decca UK album. Incidentally, no-where, either on the album cover or the label, was the \\"fake stereo\\" ever admitted. Indeed the label proclaimed \\"full frequency stereophonic sound\\". The UK album cover had an interesting misprint in that it gave the copyright date as 965!<br />As far as the tracks themselves as concerned \\"She Said Yeah\\" is a brilliant opener with other highlights including a cover of Sam Cooke's \\"Good Times\\" and, of course, \\"Heart of Stone\\". The other cuts vary from very good to above average.
B00005JK8K|3.0|1st off I am a big John Woo fan and a Nic Cage fan. This movie was predictable and a tad boring in times. Nic Cage looked overweight and underused as the protagonist.<br />The plot was simple and very formulaic.<br />I expected much much more from Woo than this.  The cinematography was that of an 80's war movie. The scenes were very clean and simplistic. We Were Soldiers was filmed much better. I found myself not caring about the rest of the movie halfway through it. I just wanted to get it over with.
B000002NJS|5.0|Maddonna will forever reinvent herself, and the moment of the time will always be reflected in her music.  She is the going icon of the past, present, and future.  This CD is a collection of music that truly inspires the mind, soul, and body.  Only Madonna does it BEST!!
0151008116|5.0|This book is a fantastic flight; beyond belief, it is an enthralling look into the mind of a 16 year old boy, into animals, into people, and into ourselves.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album can't be described with words. Just buy it and open your ears.  You'll never want close them. I envy the music fan who is a Clash virgin and will experience it all for the first time.  Buy their 1st album.  Just as good but it could almost be another band.
0440178002|1.0|I enjoyed this book, until I reached page 350, and realized that there were 800 pages to go and I knew exactly where the book would end up.  I'm taking a class on the politics of Feudal Japan, and we discuss this book at length.<br />Leaving Clavell's gross inaccuracies aside, we still have the fact that this is a rather poorly written work.  One can tell that Clavell is trying to throw underlying themes and messages into the mix, but they're thinly veiled.<br />If you're interested in good historical fiction, I urge you to invest your time into a better-written title, such as \\"Carter Beats the Devil.\\"<br />Leave this one on the shelf, save the 8 bucks.
B0000025D0|5.0|I am HUGE Springsteen fan and own all is releases.  I constantly reach for Darkness over the others.  From the pounding intro to Badlans to the beautiful closure of Darkenss this album is flawless, which is more than can be said for 99% of artists (Beatles included). This album has more emotion than yopu could imagine and after listening to it 100+ times it is always fresh. Bandlands and Adam Raised have more energy and anger than anything the boss has ever produced.  Racing is so clam &amp; soothingly sad...Promise Land and Prove it bring up the tempo.<br />The production caps it all off.  More than any other album (execept Born to Run, maybe) you can really hear the peices that make up the E Street Band.  Max's drums, Danny' keys, Steve Clarnece &amp; Crew.  One sound of perfection!<br />BUY THIS ALBUM.  It is one of the best ever made.
0780624890|5.0|Finally a mainstream vampire flick that is cool and delivers the action. Right away it is established that this is going to be different from every other vamp. movie you've seen before. I don't mind big budget Hollywood productions as long as they are somewhat creative with the storyline, don't bore me with endless dialog/build up and provide lots of action and fun. Blade was a real surprise, as I wasn't expecting much but it really blew me away with spectacular visuals, chase scenes that get your heart racing, a badass hero (Snipes' character Blade), stunning action and an overall ultra sleek feel with tight pacing and a real lack of dullness (how refreshing). The gory death scenes are a nice treat as well, this is the advantage with cg effects: you can do pretty much anything if you can imagine it. Villains are sliced to pieces and spray geysers of blood similar to Shogun Assassin (another cool movie people should check out). <br /> Wesley Snipes is not one of my favorite actors but he did a great job playing the role of a dark and mysterious warrior, he is almost bounty hunter like. Blade is a major vampire hunter, and has a really deadly arsenal of weapons, mainly consisting of a big sword that he uses to slash vamps. Blade prowls the city streets and underworld at night seeking the growing number of vampires that are planning to rule the earth. His strength and skills are heightened because of his genetics- he is part vampire. This idea works well for me, you have to be able to explain how he is able to be so successful as a hunter, how he can identify the vamps and over power them.<BR>Blade's strength is also his weakness though, he must take a syrum that controls his thirst for blood. This is gonna tie into the story for a nice little twist toward the end. Anyone who liked Interview With the Vampire will enjoy it.<br />Along with a new found female companion, Blade is lured into the final confrontation that will determine the fate of the world. Nothing new here, but the big showdown is well done and holds your attention till' the cliffhanger climax. When these vampires die they puff up and explode,<BR>spraying blood and guts into the air. This alone is worth seeing the film.<br />I've seen a few vampire movies, and I would have to say that Blade easily beats \\"John Carpenter's Vampires\\" and \\"Fright Night\\" which are two of the most popular ones, but it's not a fair fight since Blade is more action than horror.<br />Blade is a movie that oozes coolness, I would describe it as a mix of the Batman films, The Matrix, Highlander, Fist of the North Star, and From Dusk Till Dawn. I highly recommend it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is so damn refreshing. First off, the director somehow manages to get all the actors to be on the same page, for wry, real, fun portrayals. It's hard to describe, but it's not the sort of thing anyone in hollywood is fresh enough to put out right now.<br />And from that fulcrum extends a movie that has sci-fi, horror, and surreality, and coming of age, but never loses itself in pomposity or ridiculousness. I don't want to over hype it, but it's a gem.
B000002KO3|5.0|Talking Heads like their contemporaries XTC were never really  part of the punk scene or new wave. Yes, they wore the sticker but David Bryne's ambitions for his band were much larger than the genre ghetto they were initially put into. Remain in Light stands as the band's masterpiece. The songs are overflowing with African rhythms, unusual melodies and song structures and melodic pop decorations. The only other albums I can compare it to are The Beatles' Revolver and Xtc's The Big Express. Both albums are genre breaking releases that incorporate music and sounds outside of mainstream rock adding them to its musical vocabulary.<br />The unusual guitar playing of Adrian Belew along with contributions from members of Paraliment and Eno himself helped the Heads to create their most exotic, beautiful album. The band made many fine albums after this and some that are almost its equal (Speaking in Tongues and Little Creatures both have their charms and feature top flight songwriting).<br />Clearly influenced by The Beatles, 1972-74 King Crimson, Roxy Music, David Bowie and Brian Eno (who co-produced and co-wrote many of the songs), Bryne manages to take rock conventions and turn them inside out. Along with Peter Gabriel's Melt album Remain in Light was the best album of 1980.
B00005JK8K|5.0|Windtalker's, in my opinion, is one of the best World War II Movies to come out in several years. I'm not normally a big Nicholas Cage fan; however, he does an absolutely wonderful job in this movie.  This film also does a wonderful job of showing exactly what the US Marine Corps is supposed to be used for and how a beach landing is performed.  The premise:  In the beginning of the movie we see Nicholas Cage's character in charge of his squad, their surrounded and being over run by the Japanese.  From that amazing scene we're taken to Hawaii where he's recovering, and then gets the assignment to guard the \\"Windtalker.\\"  From there, we're taken back to the war in the Pacific.  What follows is an excellent and sometimes gut wrenching story about a Marine who has an extremely tough job to do and the internal conflict he has about that mission.  As I said before, this is certainly one of the best World War II movies to come out in some time and it's certainly the best one about the war in the Pacific in a great many years.<br />The SPOILER paragraphs.  I've noticed that some of the other reviewers stated that they didn't understand what this movie was about.  They also said that it was nothing but blood, guts and just a lot of killing.  With all due respect to those reviewers, I'm not exactly sure what you expected when you sat down to watch this movie then, because blood, guts, gore and senseless killing is what war is all about, quite unfortunately.  <br />For those that didn't understand what this movie was about; maybe you have to be in or have been in the military to understand this one, I'm not sure.  First and foremost, the movie is about the suffering that Nicholas Cage's character goes through after his entire squad is killed and he's seriously injured.  As the squad leader who ended up in charge, he feels responsible for the death of his men and that he is the only one that survived.  He obviously has the whole gamut of emotions to go with it, to include a healthy portion of rage.  He take's that rage with him to Saipan and unleashes it on the Japanese there and in the same sense, becomes a heroic Marine, doing things that most people get killed quickly for.<br />While suffering the emotional spectrum of his earlier combat experience, he's given the mission to protect the code.  The ideological thing to pay attention to here is, that it's the code he's assigned to protect, not specifically the bearer of that code.  That in and of itself is the inner turmoil that makes this movie and the character the winner that it is.  As a human, he has the ethical upbringing that is telling him that he shouldn't kill a fellow American, no matter what.  As a Marine though, he has the training that, by military law is supposed to supercede his ethical upbringing.  When he does actually have to kill one of them, pay attention to the fact that he doesn't care if he dies now.  This is an extremely emotional and gut wrenching movie that very clearly tells its story.  Nicholas Cage should at the very least, earn an Oscar nomination if not the award for his work on this film.
B00004ZD69|4.0|This album is incredible. It is all instrumental. A mix of droning guitars, propulsive drums, beautiful strings, this album takes its predecessors into great territory. Those influences being Glenn Branca's guitar symphonies, Brian Eno's &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; and also being similar to the way Spiritualized songs build to a climax. Inventive and never formulaic. Neither album in this two-disc set will disappoint.<BR>If you like: Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Some of these reviews are very sheltered.  Yes, the film is violent, yes, the message is against society, but these are valid forms of expression, and I think it weaves an excellent story which, culminating at a huge suprise (if some of the reviewers would keep their mouths shut...).  The DVD's features include just about EVERYTHING Fox has done with this movie (TV spots, etc.).  Bottom line: It's a must have...so long as you don't fear the truth.
B00003CWOL|2.0|I think this movie is mainly a hoot for catholics with a sense of humor. Drop that angle, and there's not much to like. A pretty hokey plotline, too many big names for no reason and no part, not doing any acting, working with a script that tosses out ideas that have a 1-second shelf life. And the down to earth modernization of mythological and religous people is Neil Gaiman stuff, Smith does it completely superficially, although they both kind of flub that awesome idea and fail to get to the emotional side of such an issue. Particularly here though, it does not rise above gimmick at all.<br />This is the first Smith movie I've seen, and so far he comes off as someone the public idolizes for his intelligence, mainly because he has dialogue about topics and his non-conformist appearance. There's so much more that can go into a movie though then posing a sort of intellectual question and then flexing the 'i'm people' roots persona.
B000068OSK|1.0|This CD is nothing more than another lousy untalented release of some stupid overnight 4 chord modern-day garage band that the young pimply 'trendoids' have latched onto in order to look hip and 'with the times'!  Fact is, the musicianship and songs on this release are lacking in a big way, and these clowns sound like rank amateurs, if that. They are a band that proves that most young music fans have very low standards as to what they expect from musicians these days, in comparison to older folks, who grew up in a time when rock bands were arguably better and more talented!  This CD would make a good expensive coaster.
B00006HBUB|1.0|What, no option to give it *0* stars? Silly is one thing, inane is another and this movie was absolutely inane.<br /><br /> Why, oh why, didn't that dopey Shaggy guy release all the *spirit thingies* when he released Velma's (I think that was her name--who knows, who cares)? It could have saved us all at least an extra half hour or so of excruciating tedium.<br /><br /> I am thankful for a couple of things: 1) it was a free rental--no money was wasted, only time I will never get back; 2) I wasn't trapped in a theater--I was able to get up and escape every once in a while.<br /><br /> I just cannot decide what would be worse: seeing this movie again or root canal. It's a close call.<br /><br /> This is definitely a movie for the die-hard Scooby-Doo fans. Believe me, if you are not currently a fan, this movie will do nothing to make you one.
6303402348|5.0|This film has so many little things going for it.  Little things that add up to one big masterpiece.  The story of the slow-witted man who triumphs works, of course, because of the performance of Tom Hanks.  But there are a lot of other things that contributed. <br />First was the script.  I have a big problem with books being altered for movies, especially when they change the physical appearance and essence of the character.  They do that in this film, but I still make an exception because it took the character to new levels.  The book was funny and somewhat farcical, but that character was basically still a Southern hick.  This move adds a lot of dimension to this by showing the feelings this man has.  <br />But what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.  He ultimately triumphs because of his basic decency.  His determination to do the right thing, and stick with those he believes in gives him his ultimate rewards.  A world full of Forrest Gumps would not produce super-computers, but it would be a world where people get along a lot better than they do in the current one.
B0000029DD|5.0|There are not enough praises to do justice to this beautiful first and last masterpiece. Grace is one of the most heartfelt album I've ever listened to, yet there is a hint of something he may be hiding, but now we'll never know. The truth in his lyrics, the Godliness in his voice, nothing will ever compare to his lyrical genious. &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; says it all.
B000006MS3|5.0|Kate's mix of talent and emotion in this work still send me, twenty years after i first heard it. &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; and &quot;All the Love&quot; remain the mark for other artists to hit. I cannot recommend this compilation highly enough.
0316666343|4.0|Yes, its a pretty stunning debut novel. Yes, it will grip you at times and lift you at others. Yes, it is very well written - it seems the author has a knack for writing down just the right stuff at just the right time - no unneeded description, dialogue or explanation, and yet no feeling of abbreviation. Every now and then Susie throws in a short insight or observation that brings accross something important that a lesser author might have spent a few pages on. <br />And yes, the ending will probably surprise and disappoint you. ( It knocked a star off my rating. ) But that won't make reading this book any less worth it. I feel its a pity that the ending almost seems written by another author, or maybe the same one in a hurry to finish the book without quite knowing how, but I hope this observation won't dissuade you from purchasing this - you can do a lot worse buying another book.
B000067JBN|1.0|I think H.G. Wells would have used his time machine to travel forward into the future to stop the making of this disappointment.  What a horrible thing to do to a classic.  The original story line, coupled with modern special effects would have been a real masterpiece.  Some scenes were good, some of the action was good, and the special effects were great, but in the end it just wasn't The Time Machine.
0345442989|3.0|This tale describes the political machinations which lead up to the story we all know from the Episode I movie, and though it is very well thought out and organized, which is an accomplishment, it is severely handicapped by James Luceno's boring, uninspired prose.  If, like I am, you are a Star Wars fan, then read it for the details, because it explains much that is otherwise left unexplained.  If, however, you wish to spend your valuable reading time on something with the barest minimum of artistic value, feel free to skip this one.  I do however recommend the next book in chronological order, &quot;Star Wars Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter&quot; by Michael Reaves, as a great example of classic pulp science fiction.  I wish he'd written this one too.
0553213105|5.0|When I first started to read this book I thought that it would have alot of old time english that I couldn't understand and that there would be alot of slow spots and bore. But as I got into the book (which didn't take very long) I found a REALLY great novel.<br />  The plot is amazing, it's one of those books that make you think about it when your done.<br /> I have read alot of romance novels in my life and this is by far the best one.<br /> I also think this book gives an important message: You should get to know a person before you jugde them because for all you know they could be your true love.<br /> If you are looking for something a little more than just a silly romance. Look no further than Pride and Predjudice.
630518299X|4.0|Truman is a thirty year old man whose life is a long running TV show. Truman was an orphan who was selected to be the \\"star\\" of this show. Everyone in Truman's life are portrayed by actors. Jim Carrey does an excellent job of portraying a man who realizes his life is not what it seams to be. Truman meats a girl, who is also an actress, that wants to free him from this show. When she tries to tell him the truth she is removed from the show. Throughout the movie Truman shows his infatuation with this girl.<br />The Truman show demonstrates how Hollywood blurrs the line between fiction and reality and how far they are willing to go to manipulate people. The Truman show is the extreme form of reality show that entrapts unsuspecting people, in this case Truman. The Truman Show demonstrates that Hollywood will go as far as its audience will let them. The reality shows today illustrate how far people are willing to be embarssed and humilated. I had an instructor that says these reality shows appeal to the lowest level of intellegence. The Truman show demonstrates that people have a hard time distinguishing between reality and fantasy.
0385503954|5.0|When I was 10 pages from the end I thought to myself &quot;the only thing I dislike about this book is that it ends&quot; ... but that was only until I read the ending ! Which I reread 3 times ;o) ! AMAZING ! My first McEwan but far from my last !
B00005JKDR|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 32 times with children and have enjoyed it more with every watching.
0553213105|5.0|When I first started this book I thought I would find a novel with alot of old time english and bore. But as I started to read this classic I found that it was quite an interesting story.<BR>  Pride and predjudice, I think,is a wonderful story that tells the reader that they should learn to know a person before they make assumptions about them.<BR>  The way that Jane Austen sews romance with mystery and bewilderment makes it so that I would gladly reccomend this book to everyone.
B00005U2JL|5.0|Gund God and Government is available.......I picked it up this weekend..Pretty interesting start menu, but not as technologically advanced as I had expected..Audio and video are excellent.  Theres a half hour documentary in this DVD that includes Eminem, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, a viscious knee injury by Manson, some weird transvestites, etc.....standard Manson stuff. The concert footage itself is great, with clips taken from many different shows around the world. Each song is made up of several clips, but because of the great editing, it's seamless.  The whole thing is great!! Far better than any other MM video to date. If you are a MM fan, get out and buy this TODAY!!
B00005JKCH|1.0|This is a stupid movie.<br />It's all mindless action and special effects. They dont try to write a good script or even hire good actors. They just want to appeal to stupid teenagers who see fancy visuals and wet their pants. It's not fun, it's not funny, just boring junk you can see any day on afternoon cartoon shows. Anybody over 13 should avoid this movie like the plague that it is.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When it was announced 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' was planning to stage a musical episode, there was a lot of people who expressed doubts that it was just cashing in on the recent trend. However, as this album proved, Joss Whedon (who wrote all the lyrics and music as well as writing and directing the episode himself) knows what he's doing. The soundtrack parodies the musical genre in great part, nowhere as evidently as on the excellent 'I'll Never Tell' as well as providing a variety of musical genres itself. From the classic musical styles it moves to something more rock-orientated with James Marsters on 'Rest In Peace' to tunes that have a more jazz and blues feel to them, such as 'What You Feel' and 'Standing'.<br />If this was only, as Anya says in the episode, a 'retro pastiche number', then it would have novelty but wouldn't last. However, Whedon has created a true reward to all those people who've been watching the show from the very beginning. This isn't just a parody, nor is it merely a revelling in a classic genre of music, but an intelligent and witty part of the 'Buffy' story arc. For instance, rather than singing meaningless love songs, 'I'll Never Tell' foreshadows Xander and Anya's disastrous wedding and 'Going Through The Motions' gives us a glimpse into not only the hardship of being a Slayer but also Buffy's worries at not being able to feel anything or emote after her resurrection. Even the seemingly simplistic 'Under Your Spell' has a double meaning besides being an adorably sweet love song. Yet it is on one of the later numbers, 'Walk Through The Fire, where the entire cast sings together, which really impresses, linking the characters together inextricably as well as producing the emotional weight of the album.<br />Of course, the singing varies. Sarah Michelle Gellar copes well under immense pressure despite not having the most distinctive voice, yet is notable impressive in that she manages to get real emotion into her songs. Take 'SomethingTo Sing About' for instance; a tune where Gellar excels as an actress. Amber Benson (Tara) and Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) are also superb, especially on their duet together. It would be wrong though not to mention the stunning work done by Christophe Beck on this soundtrack. He returned to the show specifically to score this episode, and works wonders with 'Dawn's Ballet' and it is a real pleasure to have his stunning orchestral work from previous episodes 'Restless' (which really is a show-stopper), 'Hush' and 'The Gift'. Please can we have a CD with his scores on? Judging from what's on offer here Beck is certainly up to it.<br />This is probably not only the best TV soundtrack I own but the best soundtrack in general. It's fun, doesn't take itself too seriously and is the best kind of memento from what is probably one of the best 'Buffy' episodes ever made.
B000007O9L|4.0|Stripped was released Nov 10, 1995.  It was recorded earlier the same year during the Voodoo Lounge tour and it was the Stones 7th live album.  The tracks on the album were actually recorded as follows:<BR>.....May 26/27 at the Paradiso in Amsterdam (Keith said this was the best show the band ever did)<BR>.....July 3 at the Olympia in Paris<BR>.....July 19 at the Brixton Academy in London (probably their most famous club show)<br />Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album.  Here we go:<br />There is a Japanese import version of the CD that includes one additional live track, Black Limousine (which was also released on a Japanese CD single).  In addition, there was a special UK version of the CD (often referred to as a CD+) that included material from the CD-ROM Voodoo Lounge (which was released simultaneously with the Stripped album), interviews with the band, and live video clips of backstage jamming on Shattered and Tumbling Dice, as well as part of the live recording of Like A Rolling Stone and the complete lyrics for all the songs on the album.<br />The album has strong fan support because it is a thoughtful album with a focus on musicianship.  It includes their first Dylan tune, Like A Rolling Stone, which was also released as a CD single and Wild Horses, also released as a CD single, both released only in the UK.  It also has one new song from their early setlists that they had never released....Willie Dixon's Little Baby.  Other songs from the same shows that were recorded for Stripped but which were released on CD singles and did not appear on the album are:<BR>.....Black Limousine (UK Like A Rolling Stone single)<BR>.....All Down The Line  (UK Like A Rolling Stone single)<BR>.....Live With Me (UK Wild Horses single)<BR>.....Gimme Shelter  (UK Wild Horses single)(\\"Old Gods\\" author Stephen Davis calls this the greatest single performance of their career)<BR>In addition there were two songs that appeared only on the interactive CD+ version of the album:<BR>.....Shattered<BR>.....Tumbling Dice<br />Interesting notes include:<BR>.....the tour included 126 shows seen by 8,000,000 fans and grossing a half *billion* dollars, making it the largest, most successful tour by anyone ever<BR>.....Dylan really did write Like A Rolling Stone about the band, he has always been a great fan of theirs and they have spent a lot of time together over the years<BR>.....there are two bootleg boxed sets that some people have said had to have come from the Stones themselves (one bootlegger even included a track of himself haggling with Mick over the price of the tapes).  They are known as Voodoo Brew and Voodoo Stew and offer rehearsals and alternative mixes of the Voodoo Lounge and Stripped recordings.<BR>.....an incredible and little known interactive CD-ROM (called Voodoo Lounge) was released simultaneously with the Stripped album.  It requires gamers to find hidden doors during a party in the Voodoo Lounge.  The doors lead to a private lounge where the Stones are waiting to personally show you their favorite blues artists performing on video (Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, Big Bill Broonzy, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Redding, T-Bone Walker, Otis Rush, Son House, Buddy Guy, Willie Dixon, Koko Taylor, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams, Little Walter, Robert Johnson, & Elmore James,.  The CD includes 9 songs not on Stripped (Love Is Strong, I Go Wild, and Sparks Will Fly, Blinded By Rainbows, Jump On Top Of Me, Out Of Tears, Thru & Thru, The Works, You Got Me Rocking).<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson  and from my own collection, with some of the notes from Davis' \\"Old Gods Almost Dead.\\"  Both books are available from amazon.com.

0380789035|4.0|Some years ago, I read a book called \\"Good Omens\\" by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. It was a truly funny book about angels, archangels, the Horsemen of the Apocalypse and one very confused Anti-Christ. Since then, I've read just about everything Pratchett has available in the US, but I'd never read another Gaiman book. After reading the great reviews, I figured \\"American Gods\\" should be the one.<br />It's obvious Pratchett and Gaiman have had some major philosophical discussions (perhaps over a pint or two). The first Pratchett book I read was \\"Small Gods\\". The premise was that gods die or disappear if people no longer believe in them. Gaiman's book explores the same theme, but on a grander scale. It felt somewhat like reading Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" - if you've read both, you'll know why I think so - they're epic adventures including journeys and battles between two mythical forces. Both were interesting reads. Gaiman's obviously done his research on Norse and Egyptian mythology and voudon. You can't help but be interested in a book with characters like Odin, Loki, Anubis and Bast. It also has leprechauns, piskies, and one very determined zombie.<br />For some reason, a bumper-sticker thought kept popping in my head as I read this book: Gods Are People Too.

0316666343|5.0|There's no way any book could live up to the hype this book has had in the past couple of months. That said, it IS a really good book. Ms. Sebold has created a believable heaven for Susie, and the ways the family members cope with grief feel true. A book that begins with the [way it does] doesn't seem like something you could call a \\"happy\\" book, and I guess it's not. But it is a hopeful book. It's about loss, sadness, healing and love. I think you'll enjoy it.

Of all the books that I had read about the Japs, this one leaves a deep, sorrow feeling in me. <BR>I think this book deserves to be made as one of the most, inportant historical document by those who are interested in discovering more about the World War, particularly on those that happened in Asia.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|Yesterday, for the fifth time in ten years, I saw IN THE LINE OF FIRE. And I will see it some more times again. Why ?<br />I must admit that Clint Eastwood, since 25 years, is one of my favorite actors and directors. Who could have predicted, when Clint starred in the Leone's movies, that he will become the institution he is now ?<br />In this Wolfgang Petersen's movie, he plays the role of an aged Secret Service agent who cannot forget the day JFK died. Because he was there and couldn't give his life in order to save his President. As for the Harry Callaghan of DIRTY HARRY, reality stopped at this very moment for him.<br />Until the day a mad John MALKOVICH appears. From the past, it seems, because the only way to communicate with him is by phone, an antic object which creates the panic in the ranks of the superguys of the F.B.I.<br />IN THE LINE OF FIRE is a &quot;thick&quot; movie you can talk about for hours with your friends. It is also an intelligent movie, which is pretty rare nowadays.<br />A DVD zone your library.
0156012197|5.0|When I first started to read this book I was wondering why I was reading this book for an Advanced Placement class.  By the time I was finished I realized that this book is so deep I dont know if I will ever get the full meaning.<BR>    The book is good for children because of how it is written.  The author tells about the little prince's adventures on different planets and on the earth.  Its very imaginative and simple.  Because of this, I didnt see the many underlying messages at first.<BR>    I dont want to spoil anything so lets just say that once I was done with this book I was a changed.  It gave me new insights to the world around me that I had never thought about.<BR>    I came away fromt his book with on of the best feelings.  I have never been so excited after a book, Im usually just thankful Im finally done.  This book I actually want to read again.<BR>This book is great for both chidren and adults.<BR>I reccomend it to EVERYONE.

There is a froth, a playfulness to this album that makes it stand out.  As his image is lean and sparse so too are the songs.  Lean and direct and fantastic!  Buy it, buy it!

B000056BOR|3.0|Now that DVD's have been around for several years and people have Home Theatres etc, SHAME ON ARTISAN for releasing such a poor quality DVD!!!!  If this was digitally remastered (as stated)it was poorly executed.<br />Note: the DVD suggests this is a WIDESCREEN movie presentation NOT!!  In fact this DVD is a STANDARD FORMAT picture (TV size) with true LETTERBOX limitations (Black horizontal & vertical bars).  What this means is a very small picture centered in a Standard or WIDESCREEN television. <br />CAUTION:  Artisan is notorious for releasing these false formats.  <br />CONSUMER BEWARE:  The only true WideScreen format is Anamorphic WideScreen (automatically adjusts to television screen size), Enhanced for WideScreens or Enhanced for 16:9 Televisions.<br />This movie is a cute movie with Doris Day & Cary Grant but be cautious or skip DVD's by Artisan. Only Extra - the trailer.  Enjoy something else!
B000024L5R|5.0|Celine has been my favourite singer since the beginning of the 90s and this is her best work. No other album touched me more. \\"It s all coming back to me now\\", \\"Falling into you\\", \\"Make you happy\\" and \\"River deep mountain high\\" are my highlights, but I love them all (except for \\"Seduces me\\"). And theres no greater song than \\" I love you \\". Everytime I hear it I want to cry. Thank you Celine. Looking forward to another masterpiece (but please DO NOT SING R&B!).
B00006EXCC|5.0|By late 1965/early early 1966,The Rolling Stones had either been on the road,or in a recording studio almost non-stop for three years..holed up in hotel rooms, groupies coming at you from all corners. The amazing result of this is the classic album AFTERMATH,the  uncut UK version available for the first time legally in the US; and in the brilliant sounding SACD hybrid format,with the equally revolutionary DSD encoding technique. For the first time Mick Jagger and Keith Richards produced an entire albums worth of original material, ranging the gamut from the baroque sounding [Lady Jane, I Am Waiting]., to hard rock [Its Not Easy].A lot of the songs are 'on the road' classics, or have some relation to dealing with being  a star: meeting REALLY dumb ladies/groupies. The nice thing about the new version is: NOW you can hear the sarcasm in Mick's voice on Mother's Little Helper..NOW you can FEEL the nasty growl in  Bill Wyman's bass on a dozen different tracks...Brian Jones' artistry on a dozen different instruments..The bite in Keith Richards fuzz box..and the subtle yet powerful way Charlie Watts drives this band. All in all, this UK version is an amazing 54 minutes [!!] of music, and is an absolutely EISSENTIAL part of anyone's library. [ANYone who wants bonus tracks on a 54 minute album is looking for overkill..even if it WAS possible legally! Also,Ive always been of the opinion that 90% of the 'bonus tracks' that are included on most CDs are garbage anyway!Who WANTS to hear the 5th take/re-mix of some of these songs?? Obviously not the group!]
B00006HBUA|4.0|When I first heard that a live action Scooby Doo film was in the works and that it had Freddie Prinze Jr. attached to it, I thought I wouldn't go see it.  But being such a huge Scooby fan, I bit the bullet and went and saw it anyway.  To my surprise, the film was very good.  They captured beautifully everything I loved about the series growing up.  The chase scenes, danger-prone Daphne getting into trouble etc.  Matt Lillard is the breakout star as he really became Shaggy in the film, from the voice to the laid-back, lanky movements.  The actress who played Velma (can't remember her name) also did a fantastic job too.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar weren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  I didn't like Scooby's CG animated look too much, but I got past that with his cute antics and  funny &quot;reech ratterns.&quot;  I also didn't like that Fred was portrayed as somewhat dim-witted.  In the original series, he wasn't dim at all.  Other than that, I really enjoyed this picture.  Non Scooby fans may find it childish and stupid, but it is aimed at young kids.  Most Scooby Doo fans will enjoy it but I think that non-fans can enjoy this film too, if they give it a chance.  A co-worker who wansn't a big Scooby fan loved it.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is great, all the songs are amazing, you'll be hooked on Linkin Park after the first few minutes of listening to their songs. Their style of rock will keep you on edge and asking for more. This abulm is.. Just perfect.

B000069AT7|4.0|Keep this in mind, kids...you won't be disappointed by the 2002 E.T. \\"touch-up\\" version. In fact, it's better than the original (I'm saying that out of love, given the fact that the original is included with this DVD set). Only one gripe about it...no Harrison Ford scene (Spielberg's explanation for why he didn't put it in isn't very convincing...I think he wanted it in too but realized that he made a bonehead maneuver not putting it in). But, hey, besides that you get everything you need to know about E.T. (oh, another gripe, the John Toll Documentary...awesome...but could we have seen it in its entirety? On another disc maybe?) Close to perfection. It's worth the green you got to put up for it (hey, you get a nifty little blue box to store it in too). Oh yeah, don't buy the regular edition...it's not worth the cheap price. You don't get as much stuff as the Blue Box edition.

0385484518|4.0|TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE,by Mitch Albom, was one of the best books that have ever read. Who would imagine that some of the most important lessons in life would be taught to you through a book? Mitch Albom did an incredible job of making you feel apart of the book. He made you feel like you were there through all of their tramas and all of their roller coaster emotions. <BR>   This book was about a young man learning some of life's greatest lessons from his old, dying college professor. Even though they lived miles apart, they would get together every Tuesday for their final course, that would end once Morrie passed on. Mitch, the young man in the story, was like 99% of the Americans today. He was materialistic and wrapped up in money and his work. He was reunited with his professor when he saw Morrie on T.V. one day. Morrie was talking about his deadly illness and how it had changed his life. Mitch eventually went to go see his old professor and tried to learn as much as he could from him before he died.      <BR>    This book should be required to be read in schools all over. There is a lot to be learned by Mitch's experiences, as well as his professor's. It has definitely changed my life in a positive way.
B00006C79E|5.0|The latest from St. Et is gorgeous, absolutely wonderful . . . but what's new?  &quot;Finisterre&quot; is second only to &quot;Good Humor&quot; and for one little reason:  &quot;Soft Like Me.&quot;  &quot;Finisterre&quot; keeps getting better and better with each listen but &quot;Soft Like Me&quot; is skipped right off.  The chorus is treacly but bearable; it's the Wildflower rap that makes me want to burn a CD-R just to get rid of this damned track!  It's one thing to have a rap on a St. Et song (&quot;Filthy,&quot; &quot;Calico&quot;) but it needs to move along with style and flow.  Wildflower's rap lacks both qualities.  The lyrics are clunky and the only bit of style she has is her accent.  Despite this flaw, &quot;Finisterre&quot; is a fantastic aural experience.  The stuttering yet fluid quality of tracks like &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Shower Scene&quot; make them endlessly catchy and danceable.  The electro-heavy &quot;Amateur&quot; and &quot;New Thing&quot; fit in just fine next to the warm, sunny day of &quot;Language Lab&quot; and the curiously addictive skree of &quot;How We Live Now.&quot;  The latter half of the album up to the title track is very much in the same vein as &quot;Northwestern&quot; off of &quot;Interlude.&quot;  Some fans have complained about the announcer's voice in between tracks but, for fans of older St. Et records, these snippets will bring back fond memories of the curious institial tracks featured on &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot; and &quot;So Tough.&quot;  11 out of the 12 tracks are grand!  Only &quot;Good Humor&quot; can beat that!
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer is one of the best new pop song writers and vocalists I've heard in awhile.  The well-produced disc stays fresh after multiple listenings.  Lyrics reveal a 20 something sensibility and naivete, but all in all an original, engergetic and heartfelt voice.
B000069CWE|5.0|&quot;Reanimation&quot; is an album that grows better with each passing listening. My son turned me on to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; a little over one year ago, and, although it took a while, I soon realized that Linkin Park is the best, most original act of its time. When &quot;Reanimation&quot; was released, neither one of us liked it. I now hear it at least five times per week, and it gets better with each passing listening. The remix of &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; is a classic, in this or any other generation. For those of you who haven't caught on to them yet, give Linkin Park a chance. I never thought that rap was my bag, but Linkin Park has changed my groove.
0070511136|4.0|I am sure this book's techniques could be applied to a variety of industries, however I worked in the technology field so that is where I applied it at and it worked great.    The book very clearly spells out a series of questioning techniques used to evaluate a prospect's position and needs.  It starts out by figuring out where they are at, identifying areas of pain, then proposing solutions.  He bases his techniques on statistical research his company has personally done on the effectiveness of sales calls, which I found interesting and helpful in deciding which techniques would work well for me.    I think his techniques are especially useful to the technology arena where you are finding problems (pain) that prospects are feeling and how to solve it; having said that I don't want to imply that if you aren't in this industry you wouldn't find it helpful.  I think any industry where you need to ask questions to get information, and then use that information to offer a solution to your prospect would benefit by this book.    One area of the book that I found extremely helpful is his discussion on selling benefits to the customers (based on information you gather using his techniques) and not on the features of your product.  His point is that just because you think the product is great because it will toast a piece of bread, doesn't mean it is a desire or need of your prospect and that you would know that from your questions and if it wasn't a benefit to the prospect you wouldn't mention it or try to use it as a sales point.  He calls this technique features vs. benefits.    The strong point of this book is its ability to help you develop your questioning techniques and apply the information you learn to the sales process.  I think it would be a great addition to anyone's library of sales books.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is tired of reading off your company's product spec sheet and losing sales because you don't know what the prospect is really looking for.
B000002IU9|1.0|i like heavy metal. i love bands like iron maiden, judas priest, stratovarius, mercyful fate,blind guardian etc. i was in a train station and in the cd store i was looking and i saw this cd by manowar. I had heard that they were quite good so i bought it. THIS IS THE WORST CD MADE EVER BY ANYBODY IN ANY GENRE OF MUSIC.<BR>IT IS SOOOO BAD IT IS ACTUALLY PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO. IN FACT I WAS NOT ABLE TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE CD IN ONE TRY. I HAD TO STOP IT DURING THE HORRENDOUS DRUM SOLO IN THE FIRST SONG(a waste of 28 minutes called agony and extasy of achilles or something. I GAVE THIS CD TO A FRIEND AND HE TOO AGREES IT IS TERRIBLE. I HAVE NOT YET FOUND 1 PERSON WHO CAN LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM. <BR>Reasons why it <is sooo bad>: <BR>1)atrocious music: it seems that manowar dont know what exactyl music is, they havent yet found out how to make anything that sounds remotely interesting.its the same boring power chord riffs over and over with some of the worst rythm i have ever heard.and the composition skills of manowar are just pathetic<BR>2)the vocalist:yes the worst part of the band if the music is bad he is frightfully terribly bad. he doesnt even sing he just chants out the idiotic lyrics like an actor who is reciting shakespeare<BR>3)the lyrics: this band obviously thinks that they are evil warriors or something. its really pathetic that they haevnt grown up yet. the best lyric is without doubt: 2,4,6,8 your soul i will desecrate. <BR>... It is offensive to think that Manowar even exists. ...
0395502322|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  Reading through it, the intentions of Tolkien are revealed.  It makes all of the stories of middle earth more real, tangable, comforting.  It can be read and reread; each time more layers, more connections are made.  Tolkien confronts reality of fantasy in this essay and poem.  He justifies our human need for subcreation, and comfort in art.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This CD is perfect for anyone who would like to obtain the best of Fleetwood Mac without spending a lot of money. This CD includes most their hits that you would expect to hear on the radio. It gives a great variety of some of their slow music with a spin of their faster pace music. In a nutshell this is a great CD for anyone who is just getting to know Fleetwood Mac. It is also a great CD for someone who might have heard a few of their songs on the radio and would like to hear more. This entire CD is a fantastic example of Fleetwood Mac's greatest hits. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys any of Fleetwood Mac's music.
B00003CX8N|5.0|In these days of e-books, and bland books constructed from franchised ideas and formulas, we are presented \\"84 Charing Cross Road,\\" a story about a relationship begun because of a mutual love of old great books.<br /><br />Hopkins and Bancroft share a film highlighting both of their genuine personas.<br /><br />Like Hopkins in \\"Shadowlands\\" and \\"The Remains of the Day,\\" we see him in full glory, as a quiet man of grace and sophistication.<br /><br />He is the chief buyer at an English bookstore, and Bancroft's character mails him a request for a book. Correspondence and a relationship begins. Contently and confidently married, Hopkins responds as an older brother might, and the two grow to cherish each other despite the distance.<br /><br />As they care for each other, and slowly, their local friends and family become aware, we see how love transcends the sea. Neither character has an agenda, and this left me feeling a little less cynical about the world around me.<br /><br />Like so many of today's e-mail- and chatroom-only friendships, they learn to appreciate each other, though knowing only the other as they choose to describe themselves.<br /><br />This isn't a story about books or bookstores, despite the honest representation of their demeanor and personality. Any booklover knows the search for a book, and the texture of a bookseller's knowledge and connection with his books.<br /><br />This is a movie about the depth, trust, and love of one unexpected relationship. Book lovers will enjoy the context, and good friends will smile knowingly.<br /><br />--Brockeim

B000002UB6|5.0|Without a question one of the Beatles' best, I can only explain its unpopularity by proposing the following idea: Let It Be is not an album for someone unfamiliar with a majority of the song catalogue.  It is raw, and at times curiously put together.  John's high pitched introductions, particularly his labelling of Let It Be as &quot;ark the angels come,&quot; may raise a few eyebrows, yet, looking past the idiocy, they give listeners an idea of how contemptuous the Beatles were growing of one another at this point.  As for the music, you'd be hard pressed to find a better collection of songs on a single album.  For anyone still stuck on the tragedy of Lennon-McCartney, Two of Us can be an extremely therapeutic experience.  If you ignore the fact that Paul wrote it to describe his relationship with Linda, and not John, you will come away feeling really happy.  Across the Universe, despite its inclusion on the Blue Album, is a song that many Beatles fans come to later in their experience.  It requires several spins before it really sinks in, yet without a doubt deserves strong consideration for Lennon's Greatest.  Dig a Pony, while lyrically odd, conveys a warmth that few songs can.  John really comes through on this one.  I've Got a Feeling is a pet favorite of mine, because it demonstrates why Lennon/McCartney were so great: Paul's good song has become a masterpeice with John's input - everybody had a hard year etc.  Let it Be needs no praise; perhaps it should not have titled the album, but that's purely speculative.  Across the Universe, anyone?  Interesting note: One after the nine o nine, or whatever its called, while one of the weaker songs on the album, had its roots in the 50's.  From what I've read, John  wrote the body of the song when he was a teenager back in Liverpool.  Awesome!
0671042858|5.0|The title of my book is &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;; a novel by Stephen King. It takes place over a time period of a week and a half.<br />  A nine year old girl Trisha Mcfarland, along with her mother and brother were going to hike the appalachin mountain trail. while walking along the trail her mother and brother were arguing and Trisha realized she had to go to the bathroom really bad. She was trying to tell her mom but her mom was busy yelling at her brother. Trisha decided just to walk off the trail and go by herself. She didnt want anyone to see her so she walked in further. After she was done going to the bathroom, she started to walk back and she realized she was lost.<br />  Trisha yelled for her mother but no one came. She hadn't realized she had gone so deep into the woods. She kept walking, trying not to be scared. She started running, still yelling for her mom but still no answer. Mosquitoes started forming around her head and biting her. She started following a stream hoping it would bring her to people, but it didnt. It just brought her deeper in the woods. When this stream ends she ends up finding a new one and starts to follow it. When she drinks from it she gets sick. She throws up and has diarrhea. The only thing Trisha had with her was her walkman. On it, hse would listen to the Boston Red Sox, her favorite baseball team. Her favorite pitcher on the team was Tom Gordon. Listening to the games helped Trisha stay calm, because during her entire time in the woods she always thought someone was watching her.<br />  My opinion on this book is it ws very good. I cant believe how many bad and scary things can happen to one person in such a short period of time. When Stephen King writes books he uses a lot of detail so you feel like you're acually there.

But this wasn't an ordinary march by any means. Thirteen marchers were shot dead during what was later termed \\"Bloody Sunday\\".<br />This movie alternates between both sides of the firing line. Efforts of the march's organizers leading up to the march along with several young men who participated in the march are captured. In addition, the military readiness of the British soldiers is also revealed. This movie unveils savage acts of the British soldiers as they fire upon the defenseless crowd.  <br />I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in this horrific day. It will make you think twice about the role of the military in Northern Ireland.
0385335482|4.0|Kinsella's novel, Confessions of a Shopaholic, is the hilarious read of Becky Bloomwood who will make any excuse to buy anything and put off paying her ever increasing debt.<br />Becky realizes her problem and comes up with \\"clever\\" ways she can help herself quit the buying habit and get herself out of debt; however, her plans usually backfire and only get her more in debt and her wardrobe closet more full.<br />While Becky's credit history is taking a nose dive you will be doubled over laughing at her never ending schemes and excuses.  From her letters to the credit card companies, letters to the bank, to her bag lunch scheme, to her retail shop job (for the discounts of course)  get ready for some laughs.
0671775308|5.0|Well here it is.  Difinitive data to support my gut feeling.  The poor and the middle class can choose to be wealthy.  It doesn't take an advanced degree (though that four year degree looks to have come in handy), it doesn't take being on the cutting edge of some flashy trend (though detecting and fulfilling market niches is vital), and it doesn't take an inheritance.  Millionaires in every way fit the definition of \\"working families\\".   It's about lifestyle choices.  It's about \\"cattle, not chattle\\".  Great book.  Inspired me to make the transition.  I'll be putting a few more miles on the 160K mile 1990 Honda!!!
0440219078|4.0|The Giver was a book written by Lois Lowry. I think she was trying to tell everyone that there's a possibility there's more out there than we even know about. The book's about a community where you go to school,do volunteer work, the meals are brought to your family and you have a choice to have a spouse or childeren. Everyone has there birthdays together every year. When you turn twelve they try to help find out what your's good at and what you like. Then they tell you what you'll do for the rest of your life in that community. A boy turned twelve he was chosen to be a very powerfull leader in his community. He has no rules. He findes out what his father does and what things meant in the community.  The way things were wants to changes things but, how would he go about that.  I think its a good book to read for someone who dont like to read it kinda gets your attention.
B000002BHE|5.0|With \\"Falling Into You\\", Celine Dion has set a very high standard which proves very difficult to beat even by herself. \\"Let's Talk About Love\\" and \\"A New Day Has Come\\" albums came close, but did not quite match the variety and overall quality of this one. Unbiased listening to this pre-Titanic set of songs makes a music fan acknowledge Celine's superstar status.<br />The first six songs as such -- and also their sequence, presenting the singer in six different vocal environments following one another in the best possible way -- are hands down one of the coolest things to happen to pop in 1990's. It begins with the opening Jim Steinman's MeatLoaf-ish epic \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" and ends with the cover of Eric Carmen's \\"All By Myself\\". In between, there is also the signature Diane Warren track \\"Because You Loved Me\\", the danceable \\"Make You Happy\\" and two of the best cuts here: the title track with haunting percussions and Celine's truly definitive interpretation and dramatic latin-tinged guitar ballad \\"Seduces Me\\".<br />Aldo Nova contributed two songs (and a third one on the international version of this CD), of which \\"I Love You\\" is interesting with its simple, plain beauty of songwriting and vocal treatment. The songbird also remade three of her tracks from 1995 French Album (D'Eux). Although the result here is okay, French language and original arrangements somehow work better for the French versions.<br />Another highlight of the set is the cover of Tina Turner's breakthrough \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" which should convince all of Celine's ability to sing next to anything. And before this tour de force comes to a tender end with \\"Fly\\", African chants are featured in the power ballad \\"Call the Man\\". This tune also boasts the short but glorious acoustic guitar solo by Ottmar Liebert. A real treat.<br />The elaborate production is what basically makes this album sound so good. But the 1996 Album of the Year Grammy was by no means undeserved. One can justwish there were more albums like this -- at the same time commercial and honest work of art.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is one of those movies that make you think. It makes you wonder and ponder that one question... what if? The other point that this movie makes is that and I quote Lola \\"With love you can do anything\\". She makes a good point and that is what this whole movie is about. Finally the last point is that the soundtrack is so friggin good. It has the best techno beat that I have heard since Blade came out. The only recommendation I would make is to pay for advanced shipping because you need to see this movie.
B00003CX9Q|3.0|I really don't have a problem with this set BUT....I wish the people deciding what goes into the discs would discuss this with the people designing the packaging!  the original version of E.T. is included (although not mentioned) on the exterior of the box....AND the JOHN WILLIAMS featurette on his years with Spielberg which IS listed on the box is NOT included....this must have been in exchange for the extra/ original version of the movie.  I made the decision to buy the two disc set instead of the collectable package because I have the music CD (one of the extras) and the John Williams featurette was supposedly on BOTH sets.....NOT!<br />I would have bought the larger set as I am a big fan of Williams and would have swallowed the extra charge....now, I may have to get both as I am stuck with this set.<br />For those of you NOT interested in John Williams in particular...this is a much better deal than the whole collectors box set.  You get both movies....featurettes and interviews then and now.....not the best package, but a good one for film fans.  The film of Williams conducting the live 2002 premier is interesting ....but only the AUDIO portion is the complete performance..the video is the preparation and some HIGHLIGHTS during the movie... so don't expect to watch Williams conduct the orchestra for two hours..
B00005N83M|3.0|j lo's not the best singer we all know why everybody's into her but that's another issue still if youy're a fan you could go out and cop it you'll find some stuff on here you'll dig better than me good luck.
B00003CXA3|4.0|There is a current idea in Hollywood that can be stated by the axiom, \\"never let realism get in the way of the story.\\"  (especially in the age of CGI)  The French Connection is an emphatic rebuke to this idiom.  The film is engrossing, taut, and suspenseful simply because it is realistic.  Director Friedkin (who deservedly won an Oscar) adds to the realism by using ambient lighting and framing the action like a documentary (apparently he rehearsed the actors separately from the crew, then told to crew to \\"find the shot\\").  The main credit for the realism, however, lies with Scheider and the Oscar-winning Hackman in the lead roles.  They accompanied real cops to real drug busts for a few weeks to pick up the lingo and techniques.  Friedkin also deserves credit for allowing the actors to improvise and for listening to his expert advisors.<br />The story is based on a true story, about a heroin-smuggling ring bringing drugs from Europe to New York.  The policemen protrayed by Hackman and Scheider are real people who initiated the investigation.  Of course, the movie compresses 2 years of surveillance and police work into a of couple hours, and the celebrated car-chasing-train scene didn't take place in real life.  However, each individual scene rings true, and you get a good overall impression of what life was like in the mean streets of New York in 1971.<br />This DVD has a number of extra features, including some character-developing scenes that were cut from the final version (and rightfully so).  Friedkin gives a little info on each one.  In addition, there are two documentaries, both commenting on how the film was made and how it related to the real case.  There is some overlap (especially if you also include Freidkin's audio commentary), but not enough that you get irritated by it.  Scheider and Hackman both have about 1/2 hour worth of commentary as well - Scheider's is the best of the three commentaries, in my opinion.<br />Therefore, pick up this version of the DVD to get some neat extras.  The video and sound weren't especially cleaned up for the DVD version - the filming was originally meant to be a little shakey and unclear in places - so the DVD maintains his original vision.
0375707972|1.0|I didn't like this book. I though it was a little boring. I bought it at the bookstore, and after reading the back, thought it sounded good... it says something about the woman has a dark secret, darker than murder?!?! Well, I figured out her little secret before the author tells it, and I thought it was pretty stupid and obvious. I won't tell you what it is, in case you go ahead and buy this book =)<BR>But I guess I just got the impression that this book was going to be more of a mystery, and it was more romanic and historic, two subjects I am not fond of reading!! OH WELL.
0151006903|4.0|Humorous and obscure, earthy and erudite, Eco's tale of a 12th century Italian peasant whose rise through the court of the Prussian Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, gives him a hand in most of the significant history of the time, delivers the intricate arguments, raucous personalities and mindbending paradoxes readers have come to expect.<br />The story opens during the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Having saved the historian Niketas, Baudolino proceeds to tell him his story; a grand epic which stars Baudolino as poet, statesman, reluctant soldier, spy, lover, holy man, philosopher, and pilgrim to the mythical realm of Prester John. It encompasses the Crusades, the search for the holy grail, the mysteries of the East, the circular wrangling between pope and potentate, the petty, fluid and bloody rivalries of Italian cities and the state of science at the time.<br />But there's one caveat. The young Baudolino originally caught his patron's eye because of his two greatest talents - languages and lies. So what to believe?<br />The choice is yours and the journey is stimulating, although the drug-enhanced Paris student arguments on the great questions of the day begin to read like student arguments of any era, despite the wit. Baudolino is engaging, but as an untrustworthy narrator he maintains a certain distance from the reader. Eco's fans, dictionary in hand, will enjoy the play, but those who got bogged down in \\"The Name of the Rose\\" should skip this one.
B000000OAC|5.0|I just got done listening to this album tonight on vinyl as I have it on cd and haven't heard it in it's original analog glory in a while. I heard people slagging it and thought I'd help defend what is one of Queen's best albums ever. Most everyone knows We will rock you/we are the champions so I won't go into that. Sheer Heart Attack is a song that must be played LOUD and with a bunch of unsuspecting friends in the room so you can see their faces when the weird noise part comes up. Always a question of what's wrong with your stereo comes up. All Dead, all dead is a great Brian May song with a nice Beatles harmony in it. Spread your wings is great but even better if you can find the BBC version of. More rocking at the end. Fight From the inside is ok but it does stick in your head. Get Down make Love is pretty good. Probably written to take advantage of the latest technology of the time. Sleeping on the sidewalk is a nice bit of boogie blues by Brian. Who needs you is a great little piece that features acoustic guitars by both Brian and John. IF you pan your speakers to one side you can hear just the spanish guitar without the vocals. It's Late is one of my all time favorite Queen songs. Great solos and and a great riff and a rocking drum fill by Roger at the end of the song. It's a great workout piece and shows the band at some of it's heaviest. The album closes with My Melancholy Blues. A bit of a Jazz/Blues piece by Freddie that makes you feel as if you are in a blues club. A nice way to end the album. Try and find a bootleg of Queen at the Beeb in 77. They play Spread Your wings which has a new ending to it (think Saturday night is alright for fighting), It's Late which samples some of Get Down Make Love in the middle. A much better version of Melancholy Blues which has Brian playing along. The version they should have used on the album! And Finally a slow and fast version of WE Will Rock you...The same that you would hear on Live Killers except in the studio. Hopefully these will be on the Box set whenever it comes out!!!! The CD also has a remix of We Will Rock You. It's worth hearing just for the extended guitar solo and also a sample of the solo from Stone Cold Crazy thrown into the mix. Overall a great cd from one of the greatest bands of all time!
0385720920|5.0|Choke has much similarities with Fight Club. To some extent one could say that Choke offers more of the same, but the way Palahniuk creates his universe is so dazzling, sharp and funny, that it is hard to resist. <BR>I saw David Finchers movie first, then read the novel Fight Club and then the novel Choke.<BR>I have only one request: please make Choke into a film, starring Edward Norton and directed by Fincher.<BR>Because this could take controversy to a higher level!<BR>Choke deals with issues not often used by filmmakers. The political issues, healthcare, the position of elderly, sex as a taboo, are just screaming to be put on screen...
0385484518|5.0|This was such a great book! It made me cry and laugh. It really is an inspirational book about life. It makes you think about life, and about death and dying. This book is about a teacher and a student. The teacher teaches and the student learns the lessons of life. It truly makes you contemplate on how society views death and dying. Our society teaches that death and dying is shameful. However, Morrie, the teacher explains that it shouldn't be shameful. He exposes his life and dying to teach us all a lesson....and that is \\"before you can live, you must learn how to die.\\" It was one of the best books I have read.
B00006HBUA|4.0|This is a really good movie, i loved it.  Even Freddie Prinze Jr not knowing how to act didnt ruin it.  Slightly disappointing villan, but the rest was great, excellant cast (Besides Prinze) and entertaining story line.  Worth watching.
0446310786|5.0|Different people view the same events in different ways.  In Harper Lee's novel, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", similar occurrences are interpreted in a wide variety because of beliefs, morals and values.  These non-uniform perspectives are what make each character so tangible.<BR>Every event that occurs in the novel is trans scripted through the eyes of Scout Finch.  Each character perspective, therefore, becomes an aspect of her point of view.  Her brother's courage is an excellent example of this.  \\"Jem was a born hero\\", pronounces a simple opinion of how Jem is deep down being admired by Scout, even though the two often have trouble getting along.  It is the subconscious bonds between the two that keep them from slipping away when times get rough.  However, Scout is seldom pleased about her brother's journey into manhood.  When Calpurnia tells Scout that Jem is just about Mr. Jem, Scout scoffs \\"He ain't that old.  All he needs is someone to beat him up, and I ain't big enough\\", rationalizing how Scout respects her brother, yet the respect will not extend so far as to consider him an equal to any adults.  To Scout, Jem just requires assistance in assuring him he's not as old as he thinks.  Scout just isn't up to the challenge.  However, because Scout has such a strong admiration for her brother, much of his masculinity rubs off.  This is also due to the fact that Scout never had a true mother.  Most displeased with Scout's un-ladylike behavior is Aunt Alexandria, who becomes aggravated when she learns that Scout wants to be friends with a poor, uneducated Cunningham.  \\"You're enough of a problem to your father as it is\\", demonstrates Aunt Alexandria's quest to make Scout behave in a more feminine way only leads to more static between the two.  Scout clearly has an agenda all her own.  Not Alexandria, not Jem, not even Atticus can change her attitude.<BR>Atticus is a father, a lawyer, and a human being.  But in many ways, he is more than all of those.  To Miss Maudie, he is a symbol of respect and gratitude.  \\"Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man.  We trust him to do right\\" exemplifies how Miss Maudie's intelligence enables her to take everything Atticus does that she may not agree with, and respect him for daring to accomplish the things no other man could challenge.  Atticus could just as well give up on the trial, or stop caring, but his will is too strong.  He could never allow himself to betray another man.  When the townspeople send Atticus their gifts of redemption, Atticus, while impressed, must also say \\"They must never do this again.  Times are too hard\\", demonstrating Atticus, while he is obviously being respected, holds an equal respect for the people of Maycomb.  He knows that it wasn't easy for so many of the families to show how grateful they were.  In this way, Atticus shows he has humility for everything he does.  Because of his pending antiviolence beliefs, Atticus rarely becomes angry.  Instead, he forces himself to realize that as horrible as people sometimes seem, they're still human.  \\"If spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, that's something I will gladly take\\", describes the father's best method of defense is to not lower himself to the level of Bob Ewell.  By doing this,  Atticus can avoid a serious complication, while standing up for his personal beliefs and keeping his dignity.  More people than he may realize approve his courage and honesty.  Miss Maudie's appreciation runs farther than anyone else, even Atticus' own family.  She has nothing but praise for every action he makes.  \\"If Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn't be as hard as some men are at their best\\", associates the fact that if the worst of Atticus could suddenly be brought out of him, if his superiority began to deteriorate, if he was no longer the cunning, respectful man he was, he would still be a better man than a person like Bob Ewell could ever become.  This statement proves that no one is as proud of Atticus as Miss Maudie.  And yet, Atticus very rarely shows that he is proud of himself.  \\"If I didn't [defend Tom Robinson] I couldn't hold my head up in town, I couldn't represent this county in the legislature, I couldn’t even tell you or Jem not to do something again\\" is a perfect example of a summary of Atticus' beliefs and values.  He must defend a man with no hopes of winning against a racist jury and a clever lawyer while attempting to keep his dignity and father two growing children.  Will he gain a sense of accomplishment from all this?  Perhaps.  The feeling that the right thing has been done?  Probably.  Just proving that he did the best he could, and that he tried his hardest?  Definitely.  That is his only reward, but for Atticus it is more than enough.
B00005QDW1|4.0|First of all I'm gonna review this record as a pop-rock album, NOT AS A NO DOUBT album. Because if I make my review based on the fact that they are NO DOUBT, unfortunately this cd will not get more than 2 points from me. Why? Simply because this is not A NO DOUBT record although the title says so. I don't know why Gwen and her lovely band are around saying that this is another ska-rock album whereas it is a 'POP' album. As y'know 'Rock Steady' is a kinda ska music and this album do not get any magic touch from this music.But as a POP album,this is another REVOLUTION. There are lots of great tracks on the album but the highlights are 'Making Out', 'Don't Let Me Down', 'Runnig' and 'Hella Good'...'Platinum Blonde Life' and 'Rock Steady' gets their touch from rock whereas first single 'Hey Baby' and the last one 'Underneath It All'are the only ska flavoured tracks.'Start The Fire' is a chessy-but-still catchy pop track and 'Detective' is a cool track. As a whole picture if you are expecting something like the brilliant 'Tragic Kingdom' or the dark moodish 'Return Of Saturn'; 'Rock Steady' can dissappoint you in a way I can understand but if you like the first three singles and if you like changes in music (which is good at most times); 'Rock Steady' has more than that 4 YOU...
0440180295|5.0|Looking beyond the otherworldly time travel subplot, it is not difficult to see that this novel is an antiwar statement.  A story about one man who finds himself trapped in a place he does not want to be which results in his unwillingness to cooperate with a society that refuses to get along with itself.  Ironically, he is one of the few to emerge from the war alive and unharmed, while the noble, hardworking, and dedicated fall from all around him.  So it goes.<BR>Obviously, the bombing of Dresden was a mistake.  Because of this, it has quietly faded away and been forgotten.  Almost.  I had never heard of a city known as “Dresden.”  Up until the last pages of the novel, I thought the place was fictitious.  Humanity simply wasn’t capable of such a hideous feat.  Indeed, I was partly right, but no matter how you look at it, the events did happen.  So am I missing something?  If thousands of people died that day (so it goes), why don’t I have the name “Dresden” burned into my brain.  Perhaps society as a whole does not wish to familiarize itself with all of the inhuman details of it’s ugly past.  On a personal note, I believe the knowledge of these occurrences (surely Dresden is not the only one) can give us a chance to reflect on our mistakes and take steps to ensure that at least we, as a whole, have learned our lesson.  I believe this is what the piece is trying to say.  The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a terrible event, but it happened for a reason that, over the years, has been more or less justified: it stopped a war.  Did destroying the city of Dresden accomplish that?  Of course not.  It accomplished nothing.  And yet it is rumored more people died that day than the days of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.  So it goes.  Not many people wish to know that.  But Vonnegut cares not.  He only wants to get the message across.  And he does an excellent job.
B00002E23E|5.0|this is a great film, with amazin preformence. just since i been lovin u is worth the money. this has some bits of very random yet very good fantasy clips, and they are great. If u wanna get to no zep or like em and wanna see them this is great.
0345339711|5.0|I loved this book because it was one of those you just can't put down. This sequal to the Fellowship Of The Ring is just as good as the first. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and it keeps you guessing. I loved this book because it feels like it actually happened and you are hearing from someone who was there. J.R.R. Tolkien puts so many creative creatures and characters in this book. He makes up a history of wars and detailed maps, it is a wonderful book.
B00005JL2O|4.0|The minute you get the DVD , skip everything and go straight to the Deleted scenes . There was 15  scenes that ranks from soso to utterly funny like \\"book covers\\",\\"idiot convention\\",\\"More fooks\\",\\"Hello Mahza,Hello Fahza\\",\\"More Fahza\\",\\"Dr evil has the con\\",\\"Bad reaction to the sharks\\". Don't miss the \\"Musical Number\\"(which should follow after  Austin and Nigel go separate ways but was not cut into the movie), after a few times the song is actually good and there is a funny scene with Goldmember.I enjoy those as much as the movie itself. Plus you get the commentary from Jay Roach and Myers. Music videos from Beyonce(Work it out),Britney(Boys),Ming Tea(Daddy wasn't there) and Dr Evil & Minime(Hard Knock Life). The trailers and other featurets were also included . The movie is presented in wide screen format .All in all a great package!
B00005A1VG|5.0|If anyone wants to compare the gritty realism of films in the post World War II era to the nostalgia generated by Hollywood prior to that war, then one need not look further than THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. Director Michael Curtiz presents a wildly anachronistic yet hugely entertaining view of an age that seems destined to provide swashbuckling for as long as audiences desire to see fancy duelling, archery contests, and eminently believable romance set against a backdrop of ancient urban versus rural sprawl.  Errol Flynn stars as Robin Hood, a rousingly, energetic hero who dominates each scene with athletic ability, macho good looks, a loud voice, and of course, a disarming smile that never seems to leave him, even when the odds are stacked against him.  With his bouncing off walls, climbing of trees, and general derring-do, Flynn set a standard for future action stars who have copied the essential Flynn style, but have failed to master the far more difficult trick of making all that machismo look like plain old fun.  And fun it is.  No one doubts that for even a second, Flynn is enjoying himself enormously.  It is hard to imagine James Cagney, who was briefly considered for the part, as having the requiste joy, even if he had the equally obvious Cagney energy. Olivia de Havilland, as Maid Marian, is sweet and fetching as the Norman ward of the imprisoned King Richard, whose brother John, (wonderfully portrayed by the elegant Claude Raines), revels in the opportunity to plot with his evil henchman Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone).  It was not uncommon for Hollywood to use Rathbone's machine-gun rhetoric as the prototype for a wicked but educated villain that Alan Rickman would later emulate in DIE HARD.  But it was most uncommon to use Raines in a similar vein, since he had made a career of playing trusted psychiatrists and the occasional corrupt prefect of French police.  THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is a film that places Flynn just as squarely in the bulls-eye of audience interest as he placed his arrow splitting a second arrow in the acclaimed archery contest.  Surrounding Flynn was the balancing of the goodness of Havilland played against the contrapuntal evil of Raines and Rathbone.  Nearly every scene is endlessly quotable and memorable.  It is difficult to top the shadow on the wall duelling between Flynn and Rathbone, while punctuated by such witticisms as (Rathbone): 'You will never leave this castle alive, Robin Hood.'  (Flynn):'After today, I won't have to.'  Then there is the sterling supporting cast of Eugene Pallette as the pudgy Friar Tuck (Robin: 'Don't worry, he is one of us.' Alan a Dale: 'One of us? He's more like three of us.') Alan Hale as Little John and Una O'Connor as Marian's lady-in-waiting shine in their frequent vignettes. Other versions of the Robin Hood legend have been filmed,most notably with Sean Connery as the overage, washed up Robin, but none has come close to capturing the essence of nailing the audience's heart and soul to the screen as well as Curtiz's version, which won a deserved nomination as Best Picture.  Truly, for the short space of two hours, Flynn reminds us exactly what the Golden Age of Film was all about.
B000000LZV|5.0|What was beautiful to D. Boon? To Mike Watt? To George Hurley? They were a punk band. They had ideas. They used them. They experimented. They suceeded with this. They grew.

B000002KE2|5.0|As a big \\"Black Sabbath\\" fan I have to tell you that, if you can only own one Sabbath album, then this should be it. Now I'm not saying that most Black Sabbath albums are not good. (How can anything with Toni Iommi on lead guitar be bad?) In fact, the first six are out and out classics with \\"Heaven & Hell\\", \\"Born Again\\", and the wonderful \\"Re-union\\" album joining these ranks. It's just that Volume 4 has got it all.<br />Already international superstars upon its release, \\"Volume 4\\" consolidated their position as the world's number one Heavy Metal band, a position that has never seriously been challenged. (have you heard Creed's new album \\"Weathered\\"? Talk about a load of Sabbath Wannabes.)<br />Whilst recovering from tour exhaustion, Sabbath promised that their new album would be more experimental, more progressive, and unbelievably heavier than anything they had ever done before. This was quite a claim from a band whose last album had been the classic \\"Masters Of Reality\\".<br />The opener \\"Wheels Of Confusion\\" was straight away a departure for Sabbath, clocking in at over eight and a half minutes. This was not some rambling heavy blues based jam, but a well structured epic with its inspiration coming from what was termed at the time as Progressive Rock, only, of course, played the Sabbath way. It proved that the band had no lack of inspiration either musically or lyrically. Ozzy singing Geezer Butler's words with real menace.<br /> \\"Lost in the wheels of confusion<br />  Running Thru Valleys of trees<br />  Eyes full of angry delusion<br />  Hiding in everyday fears\\"<br />\\"Wheels Of Confusion\\" transforms from crunching power chords into a glorious Sergio Leone pastiche, overlaid with thundering guitars.<br />Bursting through the speakers after this was the new single at the time \\"Tomorrow's Dream\\", the Sabbath first single since worldwide smash hit \\"Paranoid\\". A song that is about as commercial as Heavy Metal can get.<br />Then came the real shock, horror of horror, Sabbath do a ballad. Not only a ballad, but a piano led ballad that would not have been out of place on a Barry Manilow album. Fans were always prepared for Sabbath to experiment with different styles, and after the hard rockin \\"Paranoid\\" had given them a well deserved hit and a following of teenage girls. It is still frightening to imagine the audience of Radio 2 (Britain's very staid radio channel) listeners this song would of attracted, had it been released as a single and been a hit.<br />But from here on out it's pure Sabbath with Toni Iommi taking the lead and laying down some of his best known heavy riffs. Although it's not all just a bunch of loud detuned e-chord riffing as there are plenty of subtler moments, especially in the two instrumental Iommi solo spots \\"FX\\" and \\"Laguna Sunrise\\", Vol 4 also catches Ozzy at his outrageous best. You can almost hear the frills on his jacket bashing together as he stomps along with the rest of the band in the heads, down no nonsense mindless boogie sections of the songs. Geezer Butler not only gives Ozzy some wonderful lyrics to sing, but lays down some bass work that was going to become the temple plate for all players of the four string guitar for years to come. Bill Ward is the only drummer for Black Sabbath. Full stop no argument.<br />If you are a stranger to Black Sabbath's Volume Four and you like your rock music hard heavy with genuine excitement, acquaint yourself.<br />Mott the Dog.th do a ballad. Not only a ballad, but a piano led ballad that would not have been out of place on a Barry Manilow album.

It is still frightening to imagine the audience of Radio 2 (Britain's very staid radio channel) listeners this song would of attracted, had it been released as a single and been a hit.<br />But from here on out it's pure Sabbath with Toni Iommi taking the lead and laying down some of his best known heavy riffs. Although it's not all just a bunch of loud detuned e-chord riffing as there are plenty of subtler moments, especially in the two instrumental Iommi solo spots \\"FX\\" and \\"Laguna Sunrise\\", Vol 4 also catches Ozzy at his outrageous best. You can almost hear the frills on his jacket bashing together as he stomps along with the rest of the band in the heads, down no nonsense mindless boogie sections of the songs. Geezer Butler not only gives Ozzy some wonderful lyrics to sing, but lays down some bass work that was going to become the temple plate for all players of the four string guitar for years to come. Bill Ward is the only drummer for Black Sabbath. Full stop no argument.<br />If you are a stranger to Black Sabbath's Volume Four and you like your rock music hard heavy with genuine excitement, acquaint yourself.<BR>Mott the Dog.
B000002H72|5.0|\\" \\"Doolittle\\" by The Pixies influenced Nirvana...\\". I know. If you read the rock press a lot you've heard that line, and it's true, but, while \\"Nevermind\\" is also a great album, the people saying that forget that a great deal was lost in the translation.<br />  No other album by any band can go from a whisper to a scream (literally. Listen to \\"Tame\\".). That's a given. What's really wild about this album is the way it contains haunting, industrial Apocalyptic warnings and THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. I've never heard an album that conveys a feeling of foreboding over the future (\\"got killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York & New Jersey\\" sings Black Francis about the 'Monkey Gone To Heaven') mixed with romantic obssessions ('La La Love You', 'No. 13 Baby', et al. It's as if it stands as a testament to love over self destruction, but JUST BARELY. Things are still ready to crack in the David Lynch meets Mad Max atmosphere (does it come as any surprise that the Pixies covered 'The Lady In The Radiator Song' from Eraserhead?).<br />  However, if this were all Doolittle were about, it would stand as just another strange 'alternative' album. What really kicks this album into the stratosphere of bona-fide-I-100%- ... -guaruntee-it classics is that the Pixies play here like there won't be a tomorrow unless they pull it off, and this greatly adds to the final sincerity & credibility of the album.<br />Then husband & wife Kim Deal & David Lovering build a rock solid primal bass & drum foundation for the album to anchor into so it isn't swept away 'on a wave of mutilation' while Joey Santiago deftly swerves between sweet melodies & the sounds of creaking metal & concrete structures eroding in the wilderness. All the while Black Francis (as he called himself then) swings through bipolar highs & lows between grasping for the objects of affection to feel whole & then nearly going insane when it all slips through his fingers (trust me, this guy was the Ferrari of all rock n' rollscreams..).<br />  One of the other reviewers said \\"I NEVER get tired of this album!\\". I whole heartedly agree. Right on, bro.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I love Pink Floyd and have all the albums. this disc is cool and is awesome! While sadly lacking welcome to the machine Why oh why did they not include it. The tracks are all awesome. the bottom line This cd is what every floyd fan should own. It's a good start for people who are new to pink floyd. This wasn't suppose to replace the orginal albums and shouldn't have to.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I was expecting good, and it was better than that!  Most of the songs are on other releases, but I liked the arrangements on this CD better.  They provided more freedom for solos, and were more energetic as a whole.  <br />Many CD's have some selections you like a lot, and most you just sort of like.  That's what I was expecting here, but instead I got the reverse.  That is, there were a few selections I liked so-so, but most I really liked a lot.
B000002KNY|5.0|FEAR OF MUSIC stands out from all the other Talking Heads albums and also stands tall against most \\"new wave\\" music of time. Now over 20 years old (imagine that!), it still sounds fresh, energetic, creative, and youthful as ever. The songwriting is great too and \\"HEAVEN\\" may just be the best song David Byrne ever wrote. This recording has just enough Brian Eno to tie together the raw rock, quirky lyrics, and hints of world music that band later became known for. Listen to it on vinyl if you can.
0446677450|1.0|There is some common-sense stuff in here about investing, that's discussed more thoroughly (and more compassionately) in other finance books like Suze Ormon's work.  (Unlike Kiyosaki, Ormon's motto is &quot;People first, then money.&quot;) Otherwise, this book is a catalog of everything wrong with unfettered capitalism -- the author's contempt for his real father (for the crime of not being wealthy) and his unqualified admiration for his union-hating, employee-stiffing, tax-evading &quot;rich dad&quot; drips off the page at every opportunity.  It's scary to read this book and feel RELIEVED that you don't have what it takes to become a millionaire the way this guy did.  The casual way he discusses how to exploit other people's personal tragedies to get bargain-rate real estate is chilling. (I'm surprised Kiyosaki didn't list a conscience and compassion in his Liabilities list.) <br />Someone a lot wiser than Kiyosaki once asked what a man gained if he acquired the whole world but lost his soul in the process.  This book is a How-To for both those objectives.
6301966988|4.0|This is a terrific movie mixed with romance, comedy, action, drama, and suspense. Patrick Swayze stars as a banker who is suddenly murdered by an armed thug, thus leaving his poor girlfriend (Demi Moore) behind. Patrick is now a ghost who must solve the true reason to why he was murdered. By doing so, he uses the aid of a psychic (Whoopie Goldberg) to help him warn his sweetheart of a similar fate. The crimes are hard edged, the cast is awesome, the special effects are cool, and Whoopie Goldberg is howlingly funny. Buy this movie if you've never seen it. If you like collecting movies, then don't bother to resist and add this to your collection. This is a true classic.<BR>NOTE: This movie is rated PG-13, but contains a ton of profanity, including violence and a sex scene.
B00005ASHM|1.0|Or did the 60s generation suffer from horrible taste in music?  I don't know.  All I know is that I've had this album since the 3rd grade when I was into fairly simple music like the Beatles, and even then I found Pet Sounds unappealing.  It simply has nothing to it.<br />Every time I hear someone praise this album, it seems as if they focus on its &quot;great production.&quot;  This is something that I've never understood.  Great production?  Britney Spears albums have great production.  The Backstreet Boys have great production.  Does that make their work any more bearable?  I don't think so.<br />When I look for music I want it to have at least one of two things:<br />1) Soul...  I want the musicians to put true emotion into their work.  Jazz for example.<br />2) Smarts...  I want to hear songs/albums made by thoughtful and talented people who do something musically/lyrically that just blows me away.  Pink Floyd/Radiohead/Autechre for example.<br />Pet Sounds has neither.  It's full of bland harmonizing by guys that could barely swim.  The tracks do nothing daring and most of the songs were written with outside help.  That's never a good sign.  Another bad sign is the army of session musicians that the group hired.  I've yet to see a quality album put out by musical mercenaries.<br />If you're going to waste your money, at least waste it on real music.  And if your set on buying Pet Sounds, I'll dig out my old copy and give you a bargain.  It's one of my oldest CDs, but it looks like it's brand new.  I doubt that you'll play it any more than I did.  At least I hope you don't.
B00005JL3A|1.0|Never seen anything worse.
B000065U1N|4.0|BHD is a movie that is only fun to watch with a home theater system with out it it gets kinda boring to me. It is one of my all-time favorite war movies. My only beef is the DVD has barely any extras. Final score: 4/5
031286504X|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the most compelling novellas ( its very short, really) ever written. The plot is a tad unbelievable- a hideous disease has gone through the world, turning everyone to vampires, leaving the central character as sole survivor. During the night, you have the compelling and gripping scene of the central character locked up in his house, surrouded by crosses and garlic to keep the vampires out, while listening to classical music to drown out the sounds of them trying to get in.<br />During the day the central character is out with his stakes and mallets, doing the impossible task of staking as many as he can before the sun goes down again..<br />This is the essence of the plot. It is impossible not to idnetify and sympathise with the central character and ask yourself the question:&quot; What would I do in this situation?&quot;. Written in taunt, crisp sentences the story carries itself admirably, although the ending, while memorable seems a bit abrupt. Aside from that, gentle reader, this is a great read, and one you will find impossible to put down. Like &quot;The Stand&quot; this is a rare blend of drama, horror, and &quot;post Apocalypse&quot; writting, and well worth your money. It will stay with you for days.
B000002LCU|5.0|First of all, it's a bloody travesty that this album is currently out of print.  I know George was supposedly remastering his entire catalog at the time of his death, but that is no excuse for the record companies. They ignore the best of the past and just shovel mass produced garbage down our throats. This is a real artist, with real emotion...unlike todays f--- you so it pays music. All sides of George are presented here: wit, happiness, integrity,spirituality,sadness,recollections of the past, optimism for the future, all in his characteristic style. Beautiful piano, electric and acoustic guitars, nice resonant bass, simple drumming with George's slide work weaving in out out of the melodys...not one weak track here. I love this album because George, regardless of his fame and fortune, seems more human and closer than ever..From Cloud 9 to the upbeat end this is a constant album...besides All Things Must Pass, this is his best in my opinion. Don't worry if its from the 80s either..this is the 80s the way it should have been, with style..In the end the songs are what really matters anyway.  Oh one more thing, this album will make you feel good! The majority of the songs are upbeat with a few exceptions but they are just as good anyway..so it's a very positive mature album that will brighten up your day..besides George's work with the Travelling Wilburys (check out Vol. 1) this is the best of 80s George.
B00005JK8K|1.0|The acting was subpar at best and the \\"plot\\" was disconnected and random.  The historical accuracy was in serious question.<br />You are supposed to feel for certain marines when they die but you hadn't even been told thier names yet!!!  <br />Overall this movie rambles on with no real direction or purpose, the fight sceens are embarrising and the ending anti-climactic.<br />A good idea ruined!
B0000524CY|1.0|When Exorcist hit the big screen in the seventies, audiences around the nation waited in lines around the block to get into theatres everywhere. This movie revolted, facsinated, and flat out scared the hell out of them, and most of them loved it! The rest either fled the theatre in sheer terror, or became sick, and went home to turn on all the lights, and head straight for church the next AM. Wow. What a movie, and a stroke of brilliant filmmaking, to get an audience to behave as such. There are many subtle scenes that may escape those who only want to see head spinning and green pea soup. Such as the young priest's disturbing dreams about his mother. Young Regan fooling around with an Ouija Board, or the nasty demonic visage that keeps popping it's face throughout the possessed house. Regan eventually transforms into one of the most terrifying monsters in cinematic history. Her possessed 12 yr. old girl character is demonic, vile and pure evil. One can almost feel the chill in her room, or smell her repulsiveness. Dr. Billy Graham himself admitted that the film had a sense of real evil to it. The reason it scares us is fear of the unknown. If one is strictly an atheist, then it is sheer nonsense. But if one has faith in God, or any gods, then possession is a VERY real reality. The fact that the film's screenplay was based on a real story that happened in the Midwest in the fifties, only adds to the sense of dread and terror that one feels alone at night after viewing this movie. Throughout history, and in the Bible there are many mentions of demonic possession. If these instances werent mere seizures, or mental illness, then perhaps the horror that Linda Blair portrays is chillingly real.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This CD picks up where Mutations left off. See &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; for some interesting instrumentation, &quot;Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot; for flat out superb song-writing. Well-produced throughout. Ranks with Odelay as his best output, and the best among any contemporary artists.
0062502182|5.0|A beautiful story. Interpret the ending whichever way you like - because that probably has a link with your Personal Legend too.  A beautiful story which has in a sense changed my life - I love it when books do this. What is an alchemist? A man who understands nature and the world. This might sound ambiguous and corny, but for crying out loud (literally) - buy this book.<br />The book is based around Personal Legends - everyone's dream in life. Whether its something you want, somewhere you want to be, something you want to experience - everyone has one. Never lose focus, and never give up. You will come across omens along the way (signs that will help you), don't ignore them, and believe always - in the unbelievable. Because life is just that - impossibly hard to believe.<br />Love this book - Rate it 5 - a beautiful story.
0375414053|5.0|I don't know how Ms. Pearson did it.  She has created a new superhero for the 21st century -- a warrior princess for working moms.  Smart, savvy, and sleep-deprived, Kate Reddy manages international hedge funds and holds together (just barely) a modern family.  While most of us in the real world are doomed to mediocracy on all fronts, Kate scores fantastic successes at work and some rather odious defeats on the home front -- resulting in some of the funniest moments I've read in a long time. <br />Kate's notable achievements in the male-dominated world of high finance, coupled with her role as the family's primary breadwinner, provide an effective argument for staying in a job that requires that she parent her children as if she were conducting an illicit affair.  While her job is more glamorous, her wardrobe more expensive, and her figure more svelte than most of us, she is weighed down by the same guilt over missed bedtimes, forgotten school projects, and neglected husbands.  Throughout the book, Kate fights the good fight -- taking on everyone from the old boys' network to the \\"Muffia\\" of militant stay-at-home mothers -- with the kind grace that can only be borne of desperation.<br />Laced through with British colloquialisms that lend an air of mystery to some of the goings-on, this book deals out a real message for everyone struggling to keep their priorities straight in the new millennium.  And damn, it's funny!
0446677450|3.0|I was very stimulated by this book because it put money in a different perspective.  It illuminated some of the feelings that I already have and know deep inside about how the world economy works and can work to your advantage.  <BR>  It is not incredibly practical, however, and its examples aren't ones to follow as much as they are meant to inspire people to the possibility of creating passive income...<BR>  Basically, this book is not an academic or scholarly text by any means, and don't expect it's points to be filled with empirical research statistics.  On the other hand, however, I believe that there are some points in the book that we all would be better off to learn or remember, especially those who desire to rise above the current struggle for financial survival.<BR>   Kiyosaki is blunt, money-focused and often seems to ignore the negative repercussions that some financial endeavors have on other people (read \\"Fast Food Nation\\" to hear about the unethical practices of Ray Kroc's Mcdonald's, whom Kiyosaki lauds), but if one can combine business ethics with some of the inspiring ideas in \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" then I believe that person will walk away a happier and more successful person.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Since this movie revolves around its plot twists, all I can really say is that this movie is REALLY good, and definitely worth the watch.
B000003TA4|1.0|Wow!  Where do I start?  The lyrics read like a fourteen year old girl's diary...a sad litany of immature, poorly developed, and cliched gripes.  And the music has all of the sophistication of a circus monkey banging on a garbage can lid.  The sad fact of rock's demise can be seen clearly in this trite, hilarious load of self-absorbed trash...a garbled mess oftentimes described as rock's rebirth.  Whereas rock and roll will never return to the self-aware and relevant heights it reached in the late 1960's, the younger generation deserves more than this.  With it's simple-minded approach and droning lack of creativity and diversity, let's hope grunge rock is gone for good...forever relegated to that growing dust heap of contrived, naive, and uninspiring CRAP!!!
078322799X|4.0|How this movie escaped me the first time around, I'll never know, but when I had finally seen it, I was very much entertained. Not exactly a &quot;B&quot; movie, this movie has a sort of comedic situation set up that seems to intertwined with a horror situation connected by one thing: Micheal J Fox. The acting here isn't bad at all, with some great actors/actresses. MJ Fox is pretty damn good in this, something I haven't seen since Back To The Future. Dee Wallace Stone is pretty good as well, making it hard to believe that this was also Eliot's mother in E.T. There are quite a few other good perfomances in this, as well as a greatly welcomed, well done, yet creepy appearance by Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame. The story line is quite good, maybe predictable, maybe not, but worth the watch either way.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|This movie is definitely a feast for the eyes.  But, with Luhrman's style, you either love him or hate him, I've discovered.  The visuals are eye popping and transport you into a world that is a real as it is dreamy.<br />The story, too, is actually pretty good.  It reminded me of the big budget MGM musical's of early Hollywood...completely lavish and full throttle entertainment.  The different use of old and new music was also a breath of fresh air I initially thought I would hate, but found it worked well for this film.<br />That being said, aside from sets and costumes, I didn't see anything in this film that would have it merit best picture nods.  I enjoyed it, but don't agree that it was one of the best films of 2001.  It is odd, endearing, and different, and I recommend it for just pure entertainment with little intellectual investment.
0440178002|5.0|Shogun is one of my favorite novels, on several levels.  One of Clavell's more admirable qualities is to write engaging, gripping very readable dialogue, without attempting to impress us mortal readers with his command of the English language.  He writes the way confident, intelligent, interesting people talk; seriously, playfully, intimately, introspectively.  Even characters that are not meant to be intelligent or confident are written so as to clearly define their character traits.  Also, Clavell's ability to progress his characters based on their innate traits is outstanding.  Toranaga, the warlord, all powerful and utterly alone, navigates his life's plan to fulfill his destiny, with endless subplans and devised plots to achieve that aim.  Blackthorne, with his unceasing quest to destroy his enemies and return home, finds his greatest happiness and rewards in the midst of his worst nightmares; and finally understands that life is karma.  Mariko, the opposite - that life is more than random events and unswerving duty, and that love is not only permissible but essential.  There are other, powerful, influences in the story; Omi, Blackthorne's detested enemy and a friend; Yabu, provider and sadist; Fujiko, the consort.  All are remarkable characters.  Lest you, the reviewer, think I'm reading too much into this, I assure you I am not.  I've read Shogun at least 4 times.  The first time was simply to enjoy a gripping story, but each time after that I tried to follow the thought processes and event progressions of the various central characters and how they interact.  Each time I read the book there are subtleties that are made apparent to me, and I notice pivotal points  that I had not focused on during an earlier reading.  Each time I read Shogun, I get something more out of it.  <br />That is the defining mark of a brilliant and great novel.
B00005QW5X|3.0|First of all, this is NOT a movie for everyone.  I found myself scratching my head in the first 20 minutes, because it was just very...odd.  I stayed with it (the songs are GREAT and will hook you!), and I discovered a surprisingly fun little film.<br />It is like they took Rocky Horror, threw in some Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and added a generous portion of Tommy.  But you find yourself really cheering for Hedwig, in an odd sort of way.  <br />If you like your movies to go from A to Z with no deviations, I recommend only getting the soundtrack (the songs really are fun if you have any appreciation for glam rock).  But if you appreciate innovative approaches to storytelling, this will not disappoint at all.
B00006F7S4|2.0|Beck fans will approach and embrace Sea Change as a return to his delicate indie sounds.  An opportuntity to enjoy the insight into the artist's love's lost psyche at the time of this recording, but the results are anything close to resemble exciting. Beck does manage to create a genuine standard with &quot;Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot; but that is the sole highwater mark of Sea Change.  This record will be remembered with fondness as it sits horizontally next to Mutations, etc.., but there will not be a lot of spins.
B00006J3WH|5.0|No other show on television would have had the guts to do a musical episode and not end up being tongue-in-cheek. The Jossmeister has once again gone beyond episodic television to give us a superb episode... and now you can own the soundtrack!<br />Because the shooting schedule of Buffy is so chaotic, the actors didn't have time to sing on-set, so the songs were recorded off-set and lip-synched during takes. Here, you can own the original, \\"uncut\\" songs from the episode. Excellent all-round performances from the entire cast, in particular, praise for Amber Benson, James Marsters and Tony Head. \\"I'm Under Your Spell\\" is a track I keep playing and playing, along with Amber and Tony's sublime duet \\"Wish I Could Stay\\". <br />Everyone on the cast sounds like they're having a ball, belting out each track with style and real emotion. And we get three great tracks from Chris Beck, including the heart-wrenching \\"Sacrifice\\", from the Season 5 finale, \\"The Gift\\". Chris is one of the few composers on TV whose music calls the actual images to mind. As the music rises, we see in our mind's eye Buffy swan-diving into the portal to save the world. And the final push to the grave...<br />My only complaint is that this is not the last track on the CD (I have to program it so that it is), but the last track is a true gem anyway.<br />In preparing for the musical (which Joss tells us about indepth in the funniest liner notes ever!), Joss and his wife, Kai, recorded all of the songs on a demo Cd for the cast, Joss taking the male parts, Kai the female, and a little gift at the end of this release is a track from this demo, \\"Life's A Show\\". It's amazing. Kai has a beautiful voice, and trying to compare Joss to James just confused me! <br />All in all, a great release, and an unusual one too.<br />Maybe now, we'll get the score soundtrack release that's been mooted for the past few years. If the series does come to an end this year, that would be a great final release...
B00006G8O1|5.0|If you pay attention, and don't mind having to think afterward, this movie will satisfy you on so many different levels. It is beautiful, hilarious, and deeply heart-breaking. I'm not easily moved, but I had tears in my eyes all the way through the credits. A lot of people seem to want to compare it to \\"Magnolia\\", but \\"Donnie Darko\\" is far superior. Everything in it will make sense if you take the time to go over it in your head. Try not to find out too much about it before you watch.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I happen to prefer the stereo version of this classic.  However, the second song (&quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;) sounds better in mono, as Brian's voice is ever so slightly out of key and sounding a little frail in the stereo version.  I read that it's not the same vocal track as in the mono version.<br />So, if you want my advice, program your CD player to play the stereo version, but insert the mono for &quot;You Still Believe In Me.&quot;<br />You can also forget about &quot;Hang On to Your Ego&quot; - the reason is apparent after listening to &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot;
0440539811|5.0|I have very little to add to the 175 reviews which, thus far, have given The Illuminatus! Trilogy a 4.5 rating, except that I would heartily recommend this book/trilogy to anyone who has ever had an inkling of conspiracy theory creep into the back of his or her mind.<br />Buy this book.  You won't regret it.
6303471714|4.0|One year ago I asked my 50-something friend from California how she says so fit. She said she and her sister had been using this tape for years. We looked for it in NYC where we were at the time and couldn't find it. I bought one from Amazon and have been using it for a year now. I've had rheumatoid arthritis for 17 years and I'm over 50. I have been able to gradually build up to doing all of the routine except for the push-ups for which my physical therapist and I have substituted a shoulder strengthening exercise with thera-band.I have seen a wonderful improvement in my body's shape and tone. This tape focuses on the [hiney]and thighs,areas we maturing women need to keep control of...
B000002KOQ|5.0|This album captures best the innocence and beauty of Joni Mitchell's voice. This was my first Joni Mitchell record. It played like sunshine, beautiful sun shining on a glistening stream, and made me smile every time I heard it. What's amazing about this record is that it can still create that magic for me today. So many miles, so many years, so many trials and still Ms. Mitchell makes me smile. There are a few singers, songwriters, that can touch your soul with a smile the lasts a lifetime.<br />Play Morning Morgantown and see if you, like me, have a simple sweet smile appear on your face and the knowledege in your heart that her music was and is a gift that has stood the test of time.
0399230033|4.0|My son got this book when he was 15 months old and absolutely LOVES IT! He loves the animals at the zoo. There is one page where the lights are out and you can see a set of eyes in the dark.When this page is approaching, he gets so excited. This is by far his favorite book.
B00006V9A0|5.0|But this is close.  The song selection is great, but there is always going to be THAT ONE they didn't include that you loved.  In my case, I prefer the studio version of \\"All Apologies\\" rather than the \\"unplugged\\" version on this disc.  However, that's the version many heard first, so I see why they chose it.<br />The sticker on the front says \\"newly mastered\\" which does not mean \\"remastered,\\" so don't buy this if you're expecting a cleaner sound than on the original CDs.  They are equalized similarly so that the transitions from older songs to newer aren't as jarring, so that's a plus. \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is a previously unreleased single mix.<br />The new song \\"You Know You're Right\\" is good and stands well among the older hits, a rarity in compilation albums.  Is it worth buying the disc for if you already have all the other songs?  Definitely yes for fans; if you're not a die-hard, decide for yourself by listing to the sample.  <br />Overall, this is a great set, put together nearly perfectly.  I'm making my copy for the car as I write this.<br />And if it's not enough, get some Foo Fighters CDs.  The last two are fantastic.
B00006V9A0|4.0|OK...so everybody reading this already ownes at least one Nirvana record -  they changed music after all, right? So no-one needs to hear about most of the material here. 'You Know You're Right', the only unreleased track on offer is hardly the 'hit' the record company and lwayers claimed, but it is a worthy addition to the Nirvana canon. Its also entirely typical Nirvana. No suprises. No point.<br />However unnecessary this record is, it does serve as a nice reminder of how important and special this band was/is? Every song here is sublime and I'm sure everyone thinking of buying it will enjoy it. The inclusion of some of their punkier, more abrasive songs (Territorial Pissings; Scentless Aprentice; Negative Creep) would have been nice, and would have better served Kurt's memory.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Well I have to admit that I first heard them in Vanilla Sky. That closing scene on the roof top and that MUSIC! I had to find out what it was, right away. Then I figured the band out and I was blown away. I knew Cameron Crowe is aware of how to put and fit cool and effective music into his films but Sigur R&oacute;s was an excellent choise for that scene and for the movie. We also heard older Sigur R&oacute;s song Svefn-g-englar in the film. That is how I got introduced to the fascinating world of Sigur R&oacute;s, pretty low, huh? :)<br />These guys had released a lot of stuff before that, but I wasn't even aware! Thank God Cameron has his brilliant taste of good music. Later on I heard that the band never liked the film after watching it, when it was released. But even they liked the final scene and the usage of their song Njosnavelin, now titled Untitled 4. They came more popular because of it though. Movies are the best ones to spread the word.<br />All the tracks are titled Untitled and the only title on the album cover is Sigur R&oacute;s. This shows that these guys do their own thing and rely on their different but fascinating style, that makes them so interesting in the first place. There is no lyrics, there is just vocals, which go along with the music. It's music in its purest form.<br />Sigur R&oacute;s is the highest quality of alternative style and uncompromising originality. The music is floating like a dream, it's seductive and liberating at the same time. The sounds are really fresh and just listening to the floating melodies and haunting vocals departs listeners from this time and place. It delivers peace from the overloud pop, rock and techno revolution of our time, aparts you from the daily MTV mess, where everything sounds exactly the same. I am so fed up with a lot of the modern music that we are going through right now. All the high-produced and manufactured products, which all sound the same. I hope more bands like Sigur R&oacute;s will come out and introduce world something totally different, which makes music once again fresh and awakes feeling and emotions.<br />Sigur R&oacute;s is challenging us and their music invites us to experience the world and music in the way they see and feel it. Eventually, it's all about the emotions and feelings. It's about experiencing new and capability to reinvent music as it is. Sigur R&oacute;s does this and changes rock and pop into a silent harmony of enigmatic sounds that will haunt you for a long time. At least give it a change, it's something different and offers a challenge.otally different, which makes music once again fresh and awakes feeling and emotions.<br />Sigur Rós is challenging us and their music invites us to experience the world and music in the way they see and feel it.

B000069HK2|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM!  This band is about to break out and be amazingly popular... Might as well get the CD to prove that you liked them before they were popular.  The included video is amazing and these guys love to rock hard.  BUY THIS ALBUM!
B000007OY0|5.0|It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow, sublime, style- that thing that usually turns off so many moviegoers. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell (especially when one is innocent) makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet banker-accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snooty, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's equally quiet, cynical, and genial lifer- not to mention how he's &quot;a man who knows how to get things.&quot; I love what the film *doesn't* do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that factor makes their friendship all the more marvelous to watch), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it dosen't freeze its characters into 'types.' Everyone is real, and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's 'Birdman-like' veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful, sublime, and moving things ever committed to celluloid. Get it in either format.
B00006CXXU|4.0|First off I am by no means a fan of hers but, I really like this album. I thought is was going to be bad or teeny bopper like her first one, but it isn't. I sat in my car when I got it and thought I would just listen to a few seconds of each song, but I ended up listening to the WHOLE thing. Talk about shuting my negativity up! All the songs are at least ok. Sure there are a couple I won't listen to often, but there aren't any I will NEVER listen to. The only reason I got it was because it was on sale and I thought at worse I'll give it to my 6 year old, but it's mine! I definetly recommend it. The songs are so full of meaning and she uses her voices full potential. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00006L85B|3.0|i am a huge luis miguel fan and will be forever.. i go to every concert he has in my corner of the world....  But! i was a little disappointed in this cd & dvd. i was really hoping for NEW music from him. the dvd which contains his videos that have been seen by many people in the spanish speaking community and on spanish MTV.... i am hoping that his NEXT cd whenever that is will contain all NEW material..... BUT I STILL LOVE HIM TO DEATH!!!!
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Blade II was wonderfully thought out and I thought they brought back Kris Kristofferson in a believable manner. It put a whole new twist on the Vampire Hunter! It was a great movie. My only warning would be to be ready for much more blood and gore than the first movie. I do think the movie would have been just as good with a couple of scenes not being quite so graphic.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Wow! What more can I say? This was probably the best ending to a great movie I've ever seen. The whole movie sets up for what's coming at the end, and I guarantee you'll like it!<br />What a great cast with a good story and music. I'm usually not for mushy dramatic movies, but this one won me over. How could anyone not like this? It has comedy, romance, drama, action, and brains...all the ingredients the perfect movie needs.<br />This movie is simply about a day in the lives of several different people who are all connected in some way with either blood or chance meeting. All of their lives cross each other and mix into one on this fine day. However it takes a few viewings to understand...but not fully. To completely understand it, you'd have to live it.<br />The DVD is exactly what this fine film deserves...the royal treatment. The packaging and cover are nice to look at and the DVD comes with many bonus features that could keep you busy for hours.<br />It makes you laugh and cry all at the same time. When I think of The Perfect Movie, I think of this. Be prepared for the ending...
B00006CXXU|5.0|First off, let me say this - Christina Aguilera has got soul.  She may not look like or dress like a soul singer, but the girl's got it.<br />Despite what many professional reviewers have said about the first single from this album as well as the album cover (too provocative, distracts from her talent) this is one of the most refreshing and honest albums to come out of any artist in quite a while.<br />The album seems to take inspiration from a number of artists who have come before Ms. Aguilera - part Janet Jackson &quot;Control&quot;, part Mariah Carey &quot;Rainbow&quot;, and part Madonna &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, this album marks a significant departure from the canned and hackneyed teen pop we've been drowning in for eons.  It's both a rage against the machine and a declaration of independence that's apparently been brewing since 1999, when her first album (in direct competition with Britney Spears) was released.<br />Dirrty, while perhaps not the most artistically relevant song ever, was a catchy pop song and in my mind a welcome back to Christina after a 3 year break from her first album.  But the rest of the album is nothing like it.  At times angry, at times sultry, but always soulful, this alubm is an intimate portrait of Christina Aguilera the person, set to amazing music and limitless energy.<br />Christina channels her multiple points of view (woman, entertainer, daughter, lover, survivor) to craft catchy pop songs about independence (Can't Hold us Down, Fighter, Get Mine Get Yours), the emotional melting pot of relationships gone sour (Impossible, Underappreciated) and ultimately of appreciating one's own self and the things about them that make them what they are (A Voice Within, Soar).  The collaborations here make sense - Lil' Kim, Alicia Keys, Redman - and all add to the unique artistic vision behind this album.<br />After hearing her perform &quot;At Last&quot; with more soul than anyone aside from Etta James, I had always hoped that she would break away from the trappings of commercial pop and just do her own thing, using the amazing instrument that is her voice.  Closing the album with the aptly titled &quot;Singing My Song&quot; indicates that that's exactly what she plans to do.  This is one of the best albums of 2002, and indicative of a great career ahead.  Don't get caught up in the &quot;what is she wearing?&quot; crowd - those reviewers who focus more on the first single and the album cover clearly didn't listen to the album, because they completely missed the point of everything it has to say.eak away from the trappings of commercial pop and just do her own thing, using the amazing instrument that is her voice.

B0000041WV|4.0|In the early '60s, I developed an interest in the Dvorak symphonies beyond the evergreen \\"Symphony from the New World\\" and began acquiring a complete set on the Artia label from Czechoslovakia. These were authoritative, idiomatic performances, but the sound quality - and the lack of stereo on at least a few of them - left me wishing for more.      I had barely finished this Artia set when the first release or two of Istvan Kertsz's performances with the London Symphony, then on London LPs, hit the market. I can't really remember, at this late date, which was the first in the set except that it included a performance of the \\"Hussite Overture\\" that literally blew me away. In pretty short order, I soon had a second full set of Dvorak symphonies - the Kertsz set - in splendidly up-to-date stereo sound and in performances that sounded, if anything, even more idiomatic than those Artia performances. And, as noted, a large part of the \\"freshness\\" to these Kertsz performances may well be due to his relaxed approach to what had been for him new repertoire.      I don't know that there's ever been a more melodic composer than Dvorak. Some might opt for Tchaikovsky, but I would differ with them. Even Dvorak's early symphonies - long unknown to concert-goers and record-collectors - have the gift of spontaneous melody, if not the perfection of craft that his later works in the genre did. And his overtures and orchestral scherzi matched the symphonies in melodiousness: the \\"In Nature's Realm\\" Overture is downright irresistable in this respect.      This boxed set of the works, remastered for CD, is a splendid bargain. The remastered sound need take second place to any other integral set of the Dvorak symphonies (save one, which I mention briefly at the end). And of course the full magic of Kertsz's performances is there for all to enjoy without concern for \\"settling for second best\\" in any respect.      But I have a few gripes about how Decca has gone about this CD release. The set of symphonies and overtures comes in two 4-CD jewel boxes inside a slipcase. But there are only 6 CDs, the penny-pinching for which leads to awkward sidebreaks for a few of the symphonies. And the \\"Hussite Overture\\" - one of the very best in the set, and one of the very best performances of the work anywhere - is nowhere to be found.      How much better it would have been had Decca seen fit to include the \\"Hussite Overture\\" and with the very real expectation that the regrettable sidebreaks would not have occurred! This is reason enough for me to give this release only 4 stars. And it is a shame because it needn't have been that way!      There is every appearance that Ivan Fischer (interestingly, another Hungarian and not a Czech) is in the process of doing his own (and very new) traversal of these works, with the Budapest Festival Orchestra and on the Philips label. The little I've heard has me very excited. But Fischer does not \\"put Kertsz in the shade.\\" And the price is considerably higher.      Aside from the aforementioned nits about saving a disc or two and its side effects, I doubt very much that you'd be disappointed in this bargain boxed set.    Bob Zeidler
B00006J3WH|5.0|Great CD.  As one who made my own CD by transcribing the tape I made of its first broadcast (the only time the complete episode was shown) I have to say that this CD is a great improvement, audio-wise.  The singers are clearer and it's a lot easier to hear the words.  And the stereo balance is better.<br />But there's a fly in the ointment.  It's too clean.  Main problem: the sound effects are missing.  So what, you may say?  <br />If you've ever listened to some of the songs with the wham-bam-smash sounds in the background (especially the opener &quot;Going Through the Motions&quot;) you'll know that it's simply hilarious and is not to be missed.  Especially in a car stereo.  <br />Not including some of these soundtrack items and bits of dialogue that were obviously not recorded with the music also leaves voids - for example, the missing &quot;Showtime&quot; from Sweet (and the sound of the door to the Bronze crashing in) at the end of &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot; is a great loss - as is the omission of Dawn's words after the end of &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;.  And some of Sweet's other comments.  I also missed Spike's words before he went outside on &quot;Where Do We Go From Here.&quot;<br />But of course this was easily made up by the extras that were included - sooner or later Josh &amp; Co. will get wise and release a CD of nothing but Christophe Beck's work.  There's a treasure trove of material in addition to what has been released on this album and the previous music CD (and what's available on private sites online).  And there are many, many Buffyites out there (like myself) that don't usually enjoy the kind of music you're likely to hear at the Bronze!
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana...we all know and love them.  Being a huge Nirvana fan, I was highly looking foward to the release of something new to add to my collection.  I must say, the album isnt bad, just somewhat dissapointing.  The only sone on there people haven't heard ten million times is \\"You know you're right\\".  No B-sides whatsoever, and no classics like Big Cheese or Aneurysm.  The older songs are remastered, which is a plus, and it includes a remix of Pennyroyal Tea and Been a son.  All and all, the album should have had more tracks and some of the less MTV and radio frindly songs.  But, hey, it's only a greatest hits....
0780622553|3.0|Dark City has become a sort of near-classic with fans of Sci-Fi and fantasy. It's based on a fairly common premise- and I'm not really giving anything away by saying it's a premise used later by &quot;The Matrix&quot; and films going back as far the the 1960s 3D classic &quot;The Bubble&quot;- and for the most part, it delivers.<br />Visually it's an absolute stunner, and it's worth watching for that alone. The pacing is good, and plot development proceeds nicely for the most part, although the end may not be terribly satisfying to fans of films like Blade Runner, with which Dark City has been compared.<br />The acting is really the one glaring weakness of the film, and it's not the overall level of acting, but the stark contrast between the best of the cast and the worst. William Hurt and Ian Richardson are the real standout players, and Richardson in particular does a brilliant job of delivering some pretty silly lines and making them sound not only serious, but dark and forboding. Most of the supporting cast deliver similarly strong performances.<br />But two of the leads rather pale in comparison. Rufus Sewell is a classic Hollywood pretty face- he reminds me of a young Victor Mature- but the depth and range of his acting just doesn't match up with Richardson and Hurt. Sewell does a fine job for the most part, but when teamed up with Hurt or Richardson in a scene he seems to fade into the background. Keifer Sutherland is another problem. His overly-affected performance reminds me of a high school student attempting to play  someone in their 70s. It's just too affected, too gimmicky.<br />And yet despite my complaints I think it's still well worth seeing. A good choice to round out an evening of noir Sci-Fi viewing on a more upbeat note.
0783229321|1.0|I saw this movie recently after repeatedly being told it is the funniest movie ever created.  I have to say I found it to be utterly boring and unentertaining.  Honestly, not one laugh out loud moment.  Perhaps this is because I never felt the need to purchase friends by joining a fraternity, or because movies have become so much more outrageous since 1978 (e.g. American Pie goes places that movie makers could not even consider in 1978).  <br />Either it is (1) overrated, (2) irrevelant, or (3) only funny to those who donned a toga and danced around like an idiot in a desperate attempt to attract friends.  I don't know.  In any case, I won't be watching it again.  This movie just is not funny (at least not to me).  <br />If you need something of the genre/time period, go for Ridgement, Porky's, Blues Brothers, etc.  They are far superior to Animal House.
B00004T9UH|5.0|First off i'd like to say this is one of the best albums ever.The one thing so great about eminem is that he speaks his mind.Now the reviews.<BR>PSA 2000-A good opening<BR>Kill you-A good song but he swears so much u can't really hear anything.<BR>Stan-Such a good and true sond.A bit like a story<BR>Paul-U can't  say much about a skit<BR>Who Knew-Now this is a mad song with catchy rhymes<BR>Steve Berman-Again, can't say much about a skit<BR>The Real Slim Shady-A good song but does get boring after a while<br />Remember me- I think this is the worst song on his album<BR>I'm Back-A real good song with lots of disgusting stuff at the end.<BR>Marshall Mathers-Talks about his relationships a good song<BR>Ken Kaniff-Such A boring skit<BR>Drug Ballad-He raps about his love for drugs, good catchy beat<BR>Amytiville-Boss song ft Bizarre from D12<BR>B**** Please II-Eminem's own version of the song<BR>The Kids-I don't like this that much but u might<BR>Under The Influence-This track is tight and probably the best.<br />Criminal-His last song on the album and is a great one, no doubt about it.<br />I used to be allowed to listen to Eminem before my dad read the lyrics and the explicit is far better but don't be dissappointed in this clean one. PS. Bad editing. The Eminem show has better editing!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I know that many are quick to dismiss Christina, especially with her recent fondness for nudity, and while the album's title could be mistook for a sexual reference, one listen makes it clear that the title represents the album's stripped-down emotion.  This is Christina.  Finally.<br />Musically, Stripped ranges from blusey (\\"Impossible\\"), to rock (\\"Fighter\\"), to radio-friendly hip-pop (\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\") and more, and topics include society's sexual double standards, loving yourself despite outside negativity, domestic violence, relationships gone bad, and, erm, casual sex?  Not every song is a gem, but they're darn-near close.<br />And besides, with that voice, how much would bad material matter anyways?
B00004U8P9|5.0|From absolute disaster to international success, few titles have had the roller-coaster ride of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.  Originally a low-budget English stage show, it exploded into mainstream popularity and became one of London's longest running musicals--but then died a quick and very painful death in New York.  As an afterthought, the American company played a limited engagement in Los Angeles and once more the show was a smash hit and soon became a motion picture--which received mixed reviews and proved a box office dud.  That probably would have been the end of it, but the film suddenly and unexpectedly emerged as a cult movie phenomena and ascended to international acclaim.<br />The story is well known.  All-American Brad Majors and Janet Weiss become engaged and rush to tell their mentor, Dr. Everett Scott.  But they take a wrong turn, have a flat, and suddenly find themselves captives of a bisexual transvestite from outer space who is intent on making the perfect boy-toy lover from scratch.  Although the material was considerably softened for the screen, even today it remains surprisingly sharp, and the film contains numerous references to the classic Hollywood horror films that inspired it.  The cast, most of whom played in the stage versions, is truly astonishing.  Tim Curry was little known when the film was made, but he shows tremendous talent in the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter, the bisexual transvestite from outer space; his performance is a remarkable combination of broad farce, sensuality, and dark wit.  While Curry is certainly the show's centerpiece, the rest of the cast is equally effective.  Both Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are beautifully cast as the goody-goody Brad and Janet; Richard O'Brien (who wrote the stage show), Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, and Meatloaf all give memorable turns as the mad doctor's bizarre associates; and character actors Johnathan Adams and Charles Gray offer considerable drop-dead wit in supporting roles.  Only Peter Hinwood seems out of his league, selected more for looks than talent--but strange to say, this actually works in the context of the film.<br />If you've only seen this film at an audience-participation showing, you're in for a surprise: THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is wickedly funny, something you're likely to miss when every one in the audience is screaming at the screen.  Although the material was toned down for the movie--song sequences were rearranged, lyrics rewritten, and script and characters softened--the whole thing still has plenty of bite.  The story, of course, is intrinsically subversive; the script has a uniquely British sensibility; and the songs are catchy, bouncy, and frequently have lyrics that are very clever in an underhanded sort of way.  This double DVD release offers two versions of the film: the American release and the British, the latter of which is slightly different and includes the song \\"Superheroes.\\"  It also includes a version that offers \\"prompts\\" for audience participation and a version that shows the audience in action.  There are also a mixed bag of videos, interviews, and the like.  I was not greatly impressed with the bonus package--it seemed to me that it was all pretty obvious stuff--but most fans will find something to enjoy.  Whatever the case, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW has a lot more going for it than cult status; it's a good film in its own right.

0452282152|4.0|Rich with visual imagery and a arresting plot, this book draws the reader into a world of 17th century Dutch art, class relations, love and hate.<br />&quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is a beautifully crafted work of fiction based around the painting of the same name by artist Johannes Vermeer. Griet, the 16-year-old narrator, becomes a servant of the Vermeer household after her family is unable to support her. Her innate sense of composition, colour and orderliness is recogised by the aritst, and their relationship blossoms under the eye of his watchful mother-in-law and jealous wife. <br />I enjoyed this simple story for the way in which the words seemed to step out off the page and form detailed pictures in my mind. It was fascinating to see a story constructed around this famous painting which was believable yet unpredictable. Beautifully told, this book would be enjoyed by those who liked Chevalier's &quot;The Virgin Blue&quot; or simply those who like a good read!
B00005YUTD|2.0|My son (8 months)seems really bored with this one. Baby Mozart has great music and the shown items are always moving.  This one has great music, but has way too many still shots.  Loses baby's attention often.

B000001GQB|5.0|Karl Bohm is my favorite Mozart conductor, and the Berliner Philharmoniker, always at their best, here play Mozart for Bohm with the same fervor and devotion as when playing Beethoven for Karajan. <BR> Listening to these wonderful performances is enhanced by the fact that these last of Mozart's Symphonies are played together in sequential order, rather than being paired with lesser works for marketing purposes. The 39th is performed better than ever before and the 40th is splendid, as if building toward the climax of the magnificent \\"Jupiter\\", which must be heard to be believed. Just as spectacular are Bohm's readings of the \\"Haffner\\", \\"Linzer\\" and \\"Prager\\" Symphonies.<BR> Deutche Grammophon's amazing Original Image Bit Processing recreates the original sound image of the recording, virtually eliminating any sound distortion and allowing you to enjoy these performances as if you were listening to them in a concert hall, rather than on a 40 year old recording! <BR> These CD's should be in every collection of classical music.
0930289234|5.0|There is much that has been and said about Alan Moore's Watchmen in both classic and the net press over the 17 years since its release. So much so that there is little that I can add to further its status as one of the best examples the comic medium has to offer. Nor would I be able to convincingly attack it as a over hyped spectacle.<br />I would have to resign my self to say that yes its a beautifully told story that captivates and engages the reader. Its lovingly crafted characters intertwine and weave a colorful past that drapes its present in rich and full bodied history. Its dystrophic vision of the present is sneering and full of sinicism and it certainly makes bold statements about right, wrong and all the shades of grey that separate these extremes. Not to mention the art work that is fitting and cinematic in its rendition.<br />Begrudgingly on the other other hand, it is certainly is not for everyone. Its content matter and violence should be kept from younger readers. Older readers may have an issue reconciling their preconceived notions of what a comic should be to what this tile actually is. The setup and ultimate conclusion is let down by an ambiguous anti-climax that most people brought up on Hollywood storytelling will be left shaking their heads, saying \\"the good guys aren't supposed to die\\".<br />However the title on a whole despite one or two moments of pure comic fun, is a fantastic read, riveting and honestly a real page turner. Word heavy enough that it<br />will certainly be to big for one sitting for most readers. When you finally read the final frame, you will be tempted to read though it again to fill in the story. As there a many plot points you will discard as trivial in the first read through.<br />Still the question as to weather this title really is as good as they say remains. I can honestly say, yes it is.
B0000399WC|3.0|Papillon is a very good movie, although depressing. For the  occasional individual of Portuguese decent, this film may remind them of the \\"old country\\", and I can understand where they might find a morsel of encouragement in this 3 hour metaphor for: \\"Life really stinks, then you die\\". But, if you're looking for a good escape flick, then I would recommend Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 instead. Papillon features many escape attempts; all are short-lived, and the escapee's subsequent sentence/punishment is further increased. People can be very cruel. Papillon's butt-buddy (Dustin Hoffman) breaks his glasses, loses his mind, and ends up feeding chickens for the remainder of his natural life somewhere in the South Pacific. Papillon (Steve McQueen) is beaten, starved, beaten again, but somehow never loses his desire to be free. Fantastic. I closing, I'd like you to consider that a raft made of coconuts, lashed together with pubic hair is an unlikely recipe for a successful ocean voyage.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album is one of the finest pieces of work from the \\"grunge\\" era.  Quite simply put, it rocks.  There is a wide range of emotion that just seeps off this disk.  There are so many good songs that it is hard to talk about them all.  <br />\\"Jeremy,\\" a song about a boy in Texas who killed himself in front of his class at school, is the song that drove Pearl Jam into the limelight.  The song is so racked with pain and anguish.  It is just one great example of the caliber of music that is \\"Ten.\\"   <br />\\"Once,\\" \\"Evenflow,\\" and \\"Why Go\\" are all hard-rockin' tracks on the record.  Each is very emotionally charged.  \\"Black,\\" \\"Alive,\\" and \\"Release\\" are all more along the lines of melodic rock. . . None of which are ballads, but they are much slower tempo songs.  Every song is this record is top shelf.  <br />Like I said before, this record is just amazing.  Pearl Jam helped pave the way for an era.  And in turn, they have paved the way for many of today's bands to make their music.   Eddie Vedder and the gang made a record in \\"Ten\\" that has stood the test of time.  It is many times over platinum with good reason: it is spectacular.  Pearl Jam is amazing in the fact that they are still making music.  If you look, they are one of the only bands from their era that have survived, both as a band and actually still being alive.   This album is a must have in any CD collection, even better if you can find it on wax. Viva la vinyl!<br />epc
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a brilliant film in some ways. It is also a deeply disturbing film in other ways. It is brilliant in the technical execution, the pacing, the atmosphere and tension it creates. It is deeply disturbing in the way it blends religion, violence, reality and fiction.<br />Most of the fascination of this film comes from the American myths it employs to capture the audience. There is the fight for freedom from suppression (what the American Revolution was all about), there is the individual who fights for self-actualization (the self-made man), there is the savior who defeats the empire of evil (the Christian motif), there is romantic love as individual fate (the Hollywood myth). Engrossed as we are, watching these myths unfold in a new story, we do not realize that we enter a matrix of our own making. It is right there in front of us on the screen, or rather, in our heads.<br />\\"The Matrix\\" shows us a world that we are supposed to take for real while we are watching. Without our knowing it, we tend to accept the values and myths promoted by the film. That is no problem as far as quintessentially American myths are concerned. But the film also promotes violence as an attractive and appropriate means for solving problems. And not only that. In my opinion, the film also asks us to believe that a savior has the right to kill in order to liberate other people from their wrong beliefs. The disturbing part about this thought is that radicals of all hues (Muslim radicals, Christian radicals, Hindu radicals, Fascists, Communists, you name them) think the same - \\"a savior has the right to kill in order to liberate other people from their wrong beliefs.\\"<br />Bob Herbert, a columnist in the New York Times, recently wrote an article about violence in America from which I would like to quote a few lines: \\"The nation is saturated with violence. Thousands upon thousands of murders are committed each year. There are more than 200 million guns in circulation. Murder is so routine, including the killing of children, it doesn't even warrant serious news coverage in most cases. We don't know what to do about all this violence. We don't know how to process it. We don't even know how to cover it. We sensationalize it, glamorize it, eroticize it. We are fascinated, not by the victims (or by the people with serious ideas about how we might prevent some of this violence) but by the killers.\\"<br />As much as I admire \\"The Matrix\\" as a film, I think the message it conveys and the beauty of its slow-motion killing scenes contribute to the problem of violence in America. If anything, this film glamorizes violence. And to top it all, it presents the man who fires bullets so skilfully as a savior in the Christian vein: \\"Neo\\", the \\"new man\\", \\"The One\\", reborn after having been shot dead, rising to the skies to liberate us all.e, including the killing of children, it doesn't even warrant serious news coverage in most cases.

B00006NSZ5|5.0|.... <br />The first Eminem single, \\"Loose Yourself,\\" is very good.  The track is about seizing opportunity when it knocks because \\"you only get one shot.\\"   Eminem is a brilliant lyricist, the song is a great example.  It is so reflective of a person struggling with poverty and with where life is taking them.  Em's other tracks, \\"8 Mile\\" and \\"Run Rabbit Run\\" are both very impressive.  Both are very introspective, each about the drive to succeed.  <br />Eminem's group, \\"D12\\" has a pretty impressive track called \\"Rap Game.\\" These guys get better with experience.  Their first record wasn't all that impressive, but their appearance on \\"The Eminem Show\\" was pretty good, and their contribution here is top shelf.  Xzibit's track, called \\"Spitshine,\\" is pretty intense.  It is great; it has this driving beat that is rather infectious.   Jay-Z's contribution is good too.  50 Cent, an artist on Em's label, \\"Shady Records,\\" has a couple of songs on the album.  \\"Wankster\\" and \\"Places to Go\\" are pretty decent.  <br />There are a couple of non-rap tracks on the soundtrack.  Boomkat's \\"Wasting My Time\\" is a slow tempo track that sort of reminds me of a mix of En Vogue and Dido.  Very soulful, Boomkat has a very sexy voice, and her song on the record is very good.   I am not a huge Macy Gray fan, so I am not crazy about her song, but it is probably good for those who like her.  <br />Overall this is a great soundtrack.  I am looking forward to see the movie to see where the music is placed in the film.  It seems that the songs are specific and it should be interesting to see how they play into the movie.  <br />epc
B00006V9A0|5.0|The new CD aptly titled, \\"Nirvana\\" is sure to be a success like \\"The Beatles 1\\" and \\"Elvis 30 #1 Hits\\". There are a number of reasons for it. First off, most \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Best Of\\" CDS are never as good they could have been. (Remember \\"The Doors Greatest Hits\\", while that one CD was good, it sure as hell didn't contain the best of their work which is why they then released \\"Best of The Doors\\")Nirvana has released three studio albums (\\"Bleach\\", \\"Nevermind\\", and \\"In Utero\\"), 2 live records (\\"From The Muddy Banks Of Whishka\\" and \\"MTV UNPLUGGED\\") and 1 record of B-Sides and more (\\"Incestide\\"). Because they have released so many CDS, one would expect a good selection of songs from each, which is exactly what happened here. (Excluding \\"From The Muddy Banks...\\" which for some reason, they decided to not have any songs from it) The good thing about this CD is that every single song is so diverse and different from each other which is really which set Nirvana apart from the rest of the grunge bands in the early 90's. A new fan of Nirvana who just got into them and wants to get some good \\"Starting Off With\\" Material should definitely get this CD. This CD will also appeal to old Nirvana fans and collectors because of the unreleased song \\"You Know You're Right\\" and an unreleased version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" (It is the \\"Single \\" version, supposedly the way Kurt wanted it to be...) The only problem with the CD is that it is way too short. While it has almost a 50 minute running time, which is a very good amount for an average CD...this isn't an average CD! This is supposed to be the best of Nirvana! Originally, this thing was supposed to be a box set. Why they decided to make it one single CD is beyond me. This CD could have had at least a half an hour of more music added on just that one CD. They left out classics like Polly (any version of it is fine, \\"Nevermind\\" version would probably be preferred by most fans) and many others. Why oh why would they do something like that!? Overall, this CD is absolutely amazing! I mean come on...it's Nirvana! But of course like every best of package, it could have been better with a longer running time and more Nirvana classics added on. But, this CD just goes to prove that Nirvana will always be remembered as a great band, one that influenced many and left a huge dent in the music world. In my opinion, when Kurt screams the intelligible lyrics in \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", it's a bigger statement in Rock N' Roll than anything that's been released this year. Could that mean that the depth and overall impact of music is fading? Or is it just that Nirvana is a cut above the rest.
6305128952|4.0|Although this was billed as a \\"chick flick,\\" I still enjoyed this film. I can understand, though, why it's called the \\"Horse Whisperer,\\" because Redford's character sure spends a lot of time with horses. If he had to talk in a loud voice, pretty soon he'd be the \\"hoarse whisperer.\\"<br />Overall, however, a sensitive and thoughtfully done film.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is the best album of the year so far!! I can´t stop listen to it. If you liked Agaetis Byrjun then you would love this one.

Njosnavelin, Pop Song an Vaka are the highlights, even though all thesongs are amazing!!!

B00004UEDQ|5.0|The basic story of the movie is as cheesy as they make them: Gwen (Sandra Bullock) loves going out with her boyfriend, having fun, drinking heavily and using other substances. After ruining her sister's wedding, during which she crashes a car into a house, Gwen is sentenced to 28 days in jail - or in rehab. Now try to remember all the cheesy stuff Hollywood had ever taught us about rehab - and that would probably describe the rest of the film.<br />So why the 5 starts? Because even with all this gooey cheese, the movie does have a few shining moments. One of the issues that isn't obvious in the first watching is how sheltered the addicts are in the clinic, and how tough it is for them to sometimes deal with the outside world as ex - addicts. There's a scene where a mother has to face her 2 kids in 'family sessions', and she is torn between being their mother who wants to encourage them to speak, and having to deal with her feelings about what they say. Gwen also has a tough decision when she gets back home - whether to rejoin her boyfriend and her old crowd. On another occasion, Eddie, a big baseball star, is glad to have a few minutes' reminder of his previous fame and glory by giving a couple of kids who recognized him an autograph, but is uncomfortable when they ask him where his car is (having arrived in a bus with 'Rehab Center' written all over it). Their dad tries to resolve the situation by shoo - ing them into the car, but causes Eddie even further embarresment...<br />Overall, this movie is reccomended to people who like Sandra Bullok and the light comedies she usually performs in.
1567184855|5.0|A teacher once told me that we live in an age where diamonds are scattered are among the stones. This book is a diamond. It reinforces what what I knew but didn't want to belive, that there are no shortcuts for spiritual development. No magic words that I can utter as I lay dying that will save my soul. No easy way to pay the karmic debts incurred durring my long period of alcoholism. <br />What has happened in my life was not preordained. I was and still am in control of my destiny and I am fully responsible for my actions. The difference is now I know my connection to the universe and more importantly to those around me. For those sifting through the stones looking for diamonds, this may be what your seeking. For those going through the stones looking for the pieces they need to reinforce the walls around them, this book will be a disappointment.
0375414053|5.0|Kate Reddy is tough.  Kate Reddy is talented.  She's ambitious, beautiful and sensitive.  She knows what she wants.  She knows she doesn't want the kind of life (international travel, stressful career, two small children and no time for self, friends or husband) she has.  She just doesn't know how to make it stop.<br />Allison Pearson displays a vast knowledge of her subject matter, a quick wit, a delightful ability to turn a phrase (more lines from this book are being quoted in email than any other this year!) and the wisdom to mix the emotional pain of Kate's situation with the droll jokes that keep most of us going.<br />Pearson discloses the secret, that working moms everywhere are aware of...that GUILT is our largest emotion.  That in trying to do it all and be it all that we feel we give short shrift to our families, because our skills are much more finely honed at our work.  But, our workplace doesn't appreciate above and beyond, and our families tell us in many ways that we are not succeeding very well in being the \\"glue that holds...\\"  ...you know.  By the way, she also shares the fact that we bribe, lie and compete with stay at home moms to be \\"good enough\\" and that all of us suffer memory loss on a daily basis.<br />Pearson writes in partial sentences that will drive grammar teachers wild, but it is the type of language that the sleep deprived know best.  Her \\"to do lists\\" at the end of many chapters are in some ways the funniest part of the book.  But her aching emotion for her family and children, and her recognition of how important, how critical, a parent is, (and how little we recognize how few of us are well-suited to it)give the book its emotional texture.<br />Pearson may not have invented irony, but I daresay, no one has used it in quite the brilliant way she does here in the modern novel.  Now, this book will play well most likely with her peers, and not others, but that's a broad enough base to make this a sleeper hit of 2002.<br />My favorite line that's been in my emails?  From page 161:<br />Kate feels badly for a mother of a baby who is crying on the plane.  \\"My son does that when he's overtired, too:  a baby's frustration at not being able to enter sleep is that of an alcoholic locked out of a bar\\".<br />Obviously, Pearson knows whereof she speaks on the topic of insomnia, both mother's and baby's....<br />An incredible read!

B00004Z4WQ|2.0|\\"Scary Movie,\\" whose script liberally borrows from the first two \\"Scream\\" flicks, poses the question: can you do a movie that's simultaneously funny and mediocre? It also reinforces the distinction between clever slapstick comedy and cheap gags.  Much of the latter surfaces in this film.  To be sure, there are laugh-out-loud, tears-down-my-face moments that had this dude howling hysterically.  But these jokes are all-too-obvious to be considered clever, and they wear thin real fast in this film, which richly earned its R-rating.  A sample of the movies/clips that are being targeted for laughs?  \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" and a dog-tired reinterpretation of the Budweiser \\"whaaazzzup\\" commerical.  Oh, I forgot about the anatomy and bodily fluids \\"humor,\\" too.  And for a group of allegedly heterosexual men, the Wayans brothers have a curiously strange fascination with homosexuality.  There's a subplot involving one of the characters who may or may not be gay, and while it's not bad, I'm like, \\"c'mon.\\"  Director Keenan Ivory Wayans already ran the gay stereotype thing to the ground with the yawn-inducing \\"Men on Film\\" in his \\"Living Color\\" series. Can we move on?  \\"Scary Movie\\"'s appeal will depend on how much you can tolerate buffonery.  You may laugh throughout the movie, but you may not want to look at yourself in the mirror the morning after.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I bought this on DVD and watched it with my four year old niece. She was mesmerized and we both laughed and worried about the characters together. The story is so well done and the animation is beautiful. It should have gotten best picture at the Oscars!It did not just deserve the animation Oscar.
B00005ATQF|3.0|Stanley Kubrick is one of my all-time favorite movie directors. He was an unparalleled master of technique and form, releasing unequaled classics like \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"2001,\\" and \\"The Shining.\\" But even great directors have at least one subpar movie in their resume, and this puppy is it. \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is really two films blended into one. The first half is easily the more effective of the two. Here, we get an unflinching look at the day-to-day training of the Marines during the Vietnam war. The recruits are humiliated, verbally assaulted, and endure the most rigid of physical regimens. It's simultaneously unsettling and hilarious. But the minute these recruits go to war, it all goes downhill. This is quite possibly the first Kubrick movie that nearly put me to sleep. The war sequences are unexciting and perfunctory, and they pale in comparison to the rawness of the vastly superior Coppola masterpiece \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" But there are definitely Kubrick touches that help make the film interesting. A lot of the photography recalls the clean and sterile images of \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" In addition, one scene, which looks like it could have been lifted from \\"The Shining,\\" has the camera zoom into a recuit wearing the most demented facial expression. Kubrick diehards may want to give this a whirl, but if you're a fan of war movies, the final verdict is this: you've seen it all before. And better.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a great cd and i'm glad to be the first to let you know that. <BR>\\"Stripped\\" will appeal to a variety of listeners because it's got many different vibes on it, and Christina handles them all because she has real, raw talent.<BR>I give Christina props for taking the time out to make a QUALITY album and contributing her own songwriting and production to it.<BR>The end product is an album filled with strong songs.

B00005UWBP|5.0|Jurassic Park is a park on a island near Costa Rica.  There, dinosaurs are brought back to life after 65 million years.  Two dinosaur experts go to the island before it's open for the public.  There, the people have an adventure, but not a very happy one.  In fact, it turns sour when a storm knocks out the power and the dinosaurs roam about the island freely!  The Dinosaurs look real, thanks to CGI and models.  All in all, the best of the Jurassic Park movies!
B00006V9A0|5.0|Obviously the music is uniformly excellent.......in fact it's kind of cool to play this through (I hadn't listened to my Nirvana albums for a while) and remind yourself of how timeless this music actually is.......but it wouldn't be a 'best of' album without fans nitpicking over inclusions and omissions so...here goes!......Overall I think it is a very good selection, the new song (You Know You're Right) is excellent and deserves to be on here.....the only thing I would say is 'Where the hell is Aneurysm??'......actually, I would have included Aneurysm and Polly (both of which are key Nirvana tracks) at the expense of the unplugged versions of The Man Who Sold The World and Where Did You Sleep Last Night......personally, I think that the Unplugged album should have been 'off limits' for this compilation or, if it has to be included, I would have put the Unplugged version of About A Girl in instead of the one from Bleach since it really is the definitive (and best) version......some people may say that there isn't enough of Bleach represented here as it is....perhaps Negative Creep or Love Buzz could have been included....but Bleach doesn't really showcase Nirvana at their best so I think it is appropriate that there is only one song here from that album.....overall, it is still a great listen and a good (recent) history lesson for a new generation of fans who might be curious to see what all the fuss was about.
B00005UWBQ|1.0|Why they couldn't leave the dinosaurs alone after the first movie?  I mean, sure, it deserved a sequel, but not like this one.  Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) goes to &quot;site B&quot; because he wants a woman off the island before she gets eaten.  'Nuff said.

6304994540|1.0|Just because the characters are quirky and interesting doesn't mean the movie is funny or good. The character Jesus' potential was totally wasted. He could have been the funniest character but instead his lines fell flat and were boring. The plot was boring. The drug-tripping scene broke the continuity of the story. Any time a movie goer is suddenly reminded they are watching a movie, the movie has failed, and that's what the tripping scene did for me. Fargo was ten times the movie this was. I will concede that if you're a Coen Brothers fan, then you will probably enjoy this. But if you're not, stay away! And do me a favor, don't say this review wasn't helpful just because you like the movie and want to punish me. This review is here for the non-Coen fans who might get hoodwinked into thinking this is a comedy. Which it's not. If you didn't enjoy any of the following, don't watch this one: Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Rushmore, Royal Tennebaums.

Isn't it great when you finally pull all the wrapper and sticky stuff off your new CD, pop it into the stereo, and from then on every song is gold?  Gives me goosebumps!  Reminds me of the old boyfriend who first introduced me to Phil Collins and of course I get all nostalgic and that only adds to the pleasure!  \\"Against All Odds\\" is just the sexiest song ever.  And don't you love \\"True Colors?\\"  I'll agree with all my review-mates that the only thing I would wish for is MORE songs.  It just means that there will be a \\"Phil Collins Hits II\\", so we'll all look forward to it.  <BR>Now I have to get back to listening.  So much music, so little time!

Because of size contrainst (not wanted to carry the world on my back for a month) I only took 3 CDs.  Maroon 5 was one of them.  I listened to ituch more than the other two.

B000002J20|5.0|Call this album pretentious, if you must. I can't see calling it \\"the worst album ever made\\", which I've seen references to in various reviews.  This recording is the apex of progressive rock.  I guess you could also call it the omega of progressive rock.  Where do you go after \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\"?  A three-record set?  Another two-record set, only boxed in a facsimile of the Himalayas?<br />\\"TFTO\\" was the logical extension of the ideas/structure experimented with on \\"Close to the Edge\\".  Yes had succeeded with an album-side track with \\"Close to the Edge\\".  \\"TFTO\\" expanded that success with an ambitious four-sided work.  The results were mixed.  Some people love \\"TFTO\\", some people hate it.  To some it represents everything that was bad about progressive rock.  Stretching almost an hour-and-a-half, this recording taxes even the most fanatical Yes fan.  There are moments of bliss and moments of tedium.<br />It's easy to see how, a year or two after the release of \\"TFTO\\", the rock world would be assaulted by the likes of The Ramones or The Sex Pistols.  \\"TFTO\\" is not an album to send scores of potential rock 'n' rollers streaming into their garages to replicate it on guitars and drums.  Just as the multi-colored phantasmagoria of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was followed a year later by the stark, bare-bones approach of \\"John Wesley Harding\\" or \\"Music from Big Pink\\", so too did \\"TFTO\\" generate a response which gave us Punk Rock and New Wave.  The excess of this project weighed down the boat of progressive rock and made it sink.  <br />In 1974, when \\"TFTO\\" was released, we witnessed ELP climb the charts with \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\", only to follow this event with years of indifference from the record-buying public.  1974 also brought the demise of King Crimson and Robert Fripp's hiatus from the rock 'n' roll arena.  Yes began a spiraling free-fall from this point on- losing Rick Wakeman, watching record sales drop, heading for many years of personnel changes and sporadic musical success.  Yes wouldn't hit their stride again until \\"90125\\".<br />I still gave this album five stars.  I consider it one of the most important albums of the 1970s- as much for what it represents and catalyzed, as for its extraordinary music.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis.  One simple name that means so much.  And to some music lovers, a word that means almost everything.  Like it says in the CD jacket, \\"Before anyone did anything, Elvis did everything.\\"  This CD shows just that.  Elvis has been called the King of Rock and Roll, a Gospel Guru and even a Great Balladere.  This CD showcases just that.  \\"30 #1 Hits\\" is a must have for any music lover.  This CD commemorates the 25th anniversary of his death, and celebrates it in high fashion.  30 of his number ones are included here.  Everything from rock to gospel is found here.  All of his greats \\"Love Me Tender,\\" \\"Jailhouse Rock,\\" \\"All Shook Up,\\"  and \\"Can't Help Falling In Love,\\" to his lesser known greats \\"One Night,\\" \\"Way Down,\\" \\"The Wonder of You,\\" and \\"Wooden Heart\\" are here.  Standouts for me include \\"Devil In Disguise,\\" \\"Stuck On You,\\" \\"Return To Sender,\\" and \\"Good Luck Charm.\\"  There is even a `bonus' of sorts on the disc as well.  \\"A Little Less Conversation,\\" a song Elvis cut back in 1968 is remixed by JXL, dance-style, and is a wonderful listen.  But the CD jacket is perhaps where the disc shines.  It contains a brief history on each of the songs in the package, along with a few photos.  I recommend that this CD be picked up because it will indeed please any music fan.  It has the Elvis songs we all know and love, and some we probably forgot he even did.  Once purchased you may find yourself singing along at times, and that is cool.  Remember, Elvis is the King of R&R, and kings get all the attention.  :-)
B00006JL1Z|3.0|A good bet for new mac fans but for us oldies :-)A bit lacking. WHen I first saw the song selections I was a little dissapointed...They've excluded the Silver Springs (live) hit fron the dance (which most of the new fans and old have grown to love) The origonal is nice but not as good as the live version. And what about Landslide (live from the dance) which was also a radio hit....And the only selection from Behind the mask (1990) was Skies the limit. ? What about Save Me wich was a much bigger hit from that album than Skies. On the other hand It was nice to see them add...Seven Wonders, Think Anout Me &amp; Love in Store to this collection...Which in my opinion should have been added to The 1988 Greatest hits...especilly Seven Wonders. And there arn'y any new songs? Usually you throw a couple new recordings on a Greatest Hits...to not only promote it but to give something new. I actually bought this cd for the Enhanced Material...wich is a bit lacking also...The studio part is about 60 seconds and there are a few videos...It looks very much thrown together but was nice to see the rosebud version of Rhiannon...All in all I think they could have done a better Job and it seems that this was done more so to make money...I mean we all have this...Don't get me wrong F.Mac and Stevie are my fav's of all time...and i can't wait for the new material but like I said this is lacking and if you have the other albums there's no reason to get this....I gave it 3 stars 1 for the booklet...wich is very good...it includs all chart info and some great pics...And for the single versions of Rhiannon and Sisters...ANd for the inclusion of the Rhiannon Live from Rosebud..Can't wait for the new album! Will Miss Christie! Love ya Chris and hope your are well! Rock on...
B00002SSKI|5.0|A while back, my mom was downstairs watching tv, so i decided to watch it with her. It was Now and Then, and i only got to see the last 30 minutes or so, but i thought it was really good. Its kindof like a Stand By Me but with girls, which is no big deal, its from a different perspective. So, i saw it come on tv a few weeks ago and taped it, and i finally got to see the whole thing. I thought it was awesome, there are alot of funny parts and i like the whole 60's era thing going on. It looks like it might have been fun with the old fashioned restraunts and stuff. So anyway, this is a really good movie and being a guy is no big deal. Its still funny and good! So i definately reccomend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. It seems like it might be more for the pre-teens and teens, but hey my mom likes it so it varies.
0385484518|5.0|I thought the book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was very insightful. The book made me rethink about how I live my life and the ways I want to change it. I loved it when Morrie siad, \\"You have to learn how to die, before you can learn how to live.\\"  This is so true. I think it would be great if everybody had a freind and mentor like Morrie, to teach us the things we need to know.  One thing I've learned is that forgivness is just as important as loving someone. I would recomend this book to the people who take life for granted and aren't as happy as they want to be in their life.  People these days are too busy to stop and smell the roses, as they say.
0553103547|5.0|This was my first George R R Martin book and I was seriously impressed.  I think what really grabbed me about this book, and this series, is how more mature it is than the rest of the fantasy books I've read in my 15 years of experience.  Most fantasies seem geared toward the 15 to 25 audience.  Not that the younger readers will not enjoy Martin, but I think this book will appeal more to the older fantasy readers.  Ever finish a book and feel dissatisfied because everything worked out just perfectly in the end?  Not here.  Martin has given us a fantasy novel where magic is rare, things don't always work out perfectly, and heroes are refreshingly human.  You may think that not having a hero who has some supernatural abilities would be boring, but instead it gives you people with whom you can identify and accenuates the heroic action even more.  Don't get me wrong, there is magic and monsters, but not to an overbearing degree.  Instead the problems are human, as are the solutions.  Martin's characters are superbly developed and he expertly shifts point of view between them.  Some people have disapproved of Martin's use of graphic and crude language as well as his addition of sexual situations, but I found it only gave detail and credibility to the humanity of his characters.  Uncomfortable sexual situations may not belong in books with your archtypical goldenboys, but not many of those exist in this book.  The story is solid and tighly wrapped and Martin is an awesome writer.  If you feel like you are outgrowing the fantasy genre, then this is a must read.
0385505833|1.0|I made the unfortunate mistake of buying two copies of this book last year -- one to give as a gift to a dear friend, the other to keep for myself to read over the holidays.  Big Mistake.  Had I known in advance what a piece of dreck this is, I'd have saved a lot of money and embarassment.<br />I bought this because I really enjoyed \\"A Painted House,\\" and am always a sucker for a good Christmas read.  Boy was I wrong.  If this book had been written by Joe Schmuck, it would have been heaved into the reject pile by every editor in town.  However, because it has the highly bankable Grisham moniker, it managed to see light of day.  The cardboard characters that inhabit this book seem pulled from some surreal 1950's \\"Please Don't Eat the Daisies\\" world, but without the charm or humor.  The relationships between the couple and their daughter are ludicrous.  The writing is banal, and the simplific plot comes across like a bad TV movie starring the cast of Seventh Heaven. If you like good writing, good Christmas stories, or humorous books, you can safely skip this one, because you'll find none of the above.  However, if you loved \\"The Christmas Box\\" or \\"The Bridges of Madison County,\\" you'll probably love this book and should order a dozen or so for your nearest and dearest.<br />Otherwise, I'll offer some suggestions for alternatives, especially if you're seeking a gift for a special friend: 1) \\"Zippy,\\" by Haven Kimmell, is excellent, and although not a classic Christmas tale, will warm your heart with great writing and a story of small-town Americana, with an excellent Christmas ending.  2) \\"Bluebird\\" a CD by the Cambridge Singers, is absolutely heavenly music that will transport you to another realm.  Also not a classic \\"Christmas Carol\\" collection, the music truly celebrates Christ's arrival and Mary's role in it all.  The first song in particular is a favorite.  3) \\"Winter's Dance,\\" a CD by Golden Bough, is truly one of the best collections of Christmas music ever made.  Golden Bough performs around the world, on a variety of instruments, with truly magical harmonies, all done with a Celtic twist.made.

B000000OAA|5.0|QUEEN made a boat-load of albums in its career.  Of all of them, this is the one to get.  SHEER HEART ATTACK is a masterpiece of metal, pop-rock, and glam.  Everyone knows that Metallica covered &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, but nothing tops the original.  The title track is just awesome and the intro to &quot;Now I'm Here&quot; is also ear candy.  Rarely does such a solid release come along.<br />Essential.
B00005OAIE|5.0|this cd is absolutely amazing, make sure you give it more than one chance; that amazon reviewer probably wishes he could do a rewrite.... my friend played me a couple of his songs when the name john mayer hadn't even been mentioned on mtv, and i wasn't impressed. on a later listening, i went right out and bought the cd and it didn't leave my cd changer for 2 months. i promise if youre someone who has a greater appreciation for music than britney or nsync, and around the ages of 15 to 30, you'll fall in love w/ john like i did.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow!  That is all I can say!  This second English language album from Christina Aguilera (not counting her Christmas CD) is a masterpiece!  One of the biggest to hit the industry in a long time.  She put her entire heart and soul into this and it shows.  From the song about being who she is no matter what in CAN'T HOLD US DOWN (Featuring Lil' Kim) to the gorgeous WALK AWAY to the best vocals I have EVER heard from her on the gorgeous anthem BEAUTIFUL, she hits bullseyes time and again!  BEAUTIFUL, CRUZ, THE VOICE WITHIN and I'M OK (about her abusive father) are the standout tracks but every track will leave you jamming, crying but most of all rising above the pain and darkness in the world!  This album should be listened to by everyone as a way of hushing the critics who want to bash her!  This cd is stellar for anyone who likes great music.....this is not bubblegum pop people....this is about the inner world and courage in CHRISTINA AGUILERA!!  YOU rock!
0380733358|5.0|Your fingers will be so dug into the cover, you won't be able to shake it loose.  The writing is superb.  The story is superb.  The characters are superb.  Read this.  If you like suspense or thrillers, there really isn't anything else to say.  This is a classic.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Oh, by the way, it's about a cat-and-mouse game to catch a cold-blooded-Nazi-secret-agent-killer in Britain during World War II before he can pass along intel to his homeland that could turn the war tide for the worse.
B00000IP4H|4.0|Testament... \\"Demonic\\"... no James Murphy, no Alex Skolnick, no problem. Glen does a good job with the solos and Eric's riffs are powerful as ever. This is obviously very different from the powerful, awesome thrash sound of \\"Practice What You Preach\\". Just listen to \\"Demonic Refusal\\". It has more of a death metal feel to it. \\"John Doe\\" is a great song as well. I recommend to fans of metal who have never heard Testament before because many of their diehards don't like this album as much. If you want to hear what these guys sounded like back in the day, buy \\"Practice What You Preach\\".
B00000099Y|5.0|I think people are putting less than 5 stars because they don't understand that this band is THE most talented out right now.  When people are making fun of how TOOL listeners are all artsy, they don't understand that there is no right and wrong in judging art.  I don't like Picasso's paintings, I think he's nuts.  But I don't give his work 1 out of 5 stars.  I know he's good at what he does, he just doesn't interest me, and I believe this is analogous to the reasoning behind giving TOOL anything less than 5 stars.  Sure this album has filler, but it still it gives you 70 minutes of awesome music.  Every song on this album is great...some are in fact better than others but all move me in some sort of way.  Buy this CD!!!
B000000H3W|5.0|This is a true classic in the thrash metal world. Max's voice was in its prime on this album after commercializing it on \\"Roots\\" and later Soulfly (blech barf) and \\"singing\\" more on \\"Beneath The Remains\\". In my opinion, Sepultura \\"sold out\\" on \\"Chaos AD\\". The new stuff with Derek Green actually is better than anything on \\"Roots\\" because as grunge took over, Sepultura declined and the band was angry about Max leaving so they had to play something not as in the numetal direction. Really, how can anybody put down tracks like \\"Murder\\" if you are into thrash? If you like this, I recommend any Sepultura album before this as well as any 80s Slayer album.
B000069HK2|5.0|So, you think u know emo? Not until you've heard this cd. The neverending jumps between hard, loud, and powerful to soft, melodic, and all around intense whispers keeps any listener entertained. Before I heard this cd, I never considered myself a fan of the screaming vocals in many emo bands. I'll admit that without it, some of my fave bands, like Finch and Thursday, would not be the same without it, but The Used was the first band to really master it. Thursday, though no emo collection would be complete without it, seems a little too thrown together. They start to scream in the middle of a melody giving them a harsh tone, but The Used seems to know exactly where to put those heartfelt bursts of emotion amidst the roudy, loud guitar riffs and hard-hitting drum beats. They also show all sides of their talent. &quot;Taste of Ink&quot; has to be the best, most melodic and heartfelt song out there and the power and intensity of &quot;Box of Sharp Objects&quot; is by all means undisputed. In short, nothing tops their blend of sound and emotion...welcome to true emo
0316666343|5.0|I read this book in less than 2 days. It riveted me and there were parts where I could not help but cry. It is so sad.  Susie Salmon, murdered at 14 looking down from Heaven to see her friends and family cope. (I hope Heaven is just as Susie describes it...for from the eyes of this 14 year old, it is beautiful).<br />Sebold had each member of Susie's family experience this tragic event differently. Her mother ran from her memories, her father lost himself in Susie's little brother, Buck.  Lindsey, her sister was strong and grew up too fast.  Ruth, Susie's friend, saw Susie's spirit leave this world, and became obsessed for years about her.  The characters felt real to me, as if I knew them all from my own neighborhood.<br />I liked Sebold's writing style, and I felt Susie's longing to be on Earth.  I cried for Susie's family and I cried for Susie's death.  I worried when I picked this book up that it would not meet my expectations, but I truly enjoyed this unique story.  This book is in my top three faves of all time. Worth 5 stars.
B000001IQH|5.0|The first song on this cd, \\"Maxwell Murder\\" did me in, I was a Rancid addict and nothing was going to save me. Song after song pumps out and hardly leaves you time to breath from belting out the lyrics right along with 'em. Just when you think you've heard enough punk for one album (19 songs start wearin' u down) they thrown in a little ska to keep u interested. Rancid defiently has to be the most talented punk band that's still making music. If you don't think these guyz are real punk or any good, your blind, deaf, and dumb. There is not a band out there than can top these guys raw quality. If you can top the bass of this album, I congratulate on a job well done, you must've spent your whole life trying to beat the bassist who is completly SICK WICKED and AWESOME!! nobody plays like these guyz...
B00003CWTI|5.0|&quot;Magnolia&quot;, P.T. Anderson's philisophical and imaginative follow up to &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, is a daunting descent into realms of human emotion. The story of 9 main characters whose lives spin uncontrollably upon a roulette wheel of chance hits home with it's soundtrack, subtext, and intellectual brilliancy. All the actors in this film express the desire of the same kind - that inpenetrable taste of happiness, the feeling of life slipping away, the motions, motives, and madness of life. Anderson directs with somber sadness, each character's expression representing isolated soliquoys depicting defeat. While these actors subject their instincts into their character's drives and feelings, we begin to suspect that Anderson's creations are just metaphors for ourselves; rather, the emotive and ethical extremes of our daily escapades. Let's just ignore the fact that Mr. Tom Cruise is in this picture; ignore the fact that Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Robards appear in the film. As blockbuster names and household trivial quirks, these actors and actresses aren't what makes this film, but the story they create together. A Magnolia flower grows with each petal attached to its side, and wherever it grows, so does it's parts. Anderson, inventive, subjective, morally and immorally, creates a world of truths and lies, and does so beautifully.
B000002MY3|5.0|Not a girl you would ever want for an ex, but definitely an artist with phenomenal talent and artistic range, Alanis Morissette pours heart and soul into this extraordinary album.  The raw emotion and venom of the cut &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; is so vivid I can almost see fumes of fury coming out of my CD player.<br />JAGGED LITTLE PILL is loaded with tantalizing gems of audio delight, from &quot;Ironic&quot; to &quot;You Learn.&quot;  The surprise acapella song hidden away in Track 13, &quot;Would You Forgive Me Love&quot; (Okay, so it doesn't have a title, but this works for me) is an extra bonus of unbridled angst by an artist who effectively carries the full gambit of female emotions on her sleeve.  Alanis Morissette pulls off every cut on this keeper with stunning conviction and dynamic singing.
B00005V1Z0|4.0|Fans of video-game-movies look no further. \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" is the best of its kind. Loaded with nonstop action and thrilling fun, Angelina Jolie plays the very sexy Lara Croft, a british chick with an attitude. She uncovers the secret of an ancient legend hidden in a mysterious clock. Now it's a race against time as she must go against fellow archaeologists to find an all-powerful triangle. Great special effects, great direction from Simon West, and some high-flyin' explosive action mixed with the seductiveness of Jolie make this film an adventure-fans weapon of choice.
B00006CXSS|5.0|An outstanding tribute to the men of the 101st Parachute Infantry Regiment.  Much better than \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", this chronicles the lives of the men of Company E (Easy Company).  Be with the men from Camp Toccoa to Normandy, Holland and Bastogne, and finally at Hitler's Retreat in Austria.  Learn what happened to the survivors of this outfit and see their interviews at the beginning of each episode, as well as in the Veterans Day Special, \\"We Stand Alone, Together\\".  The Airdrop Sequence over Normandy looks every bit of what veterans describe, and the shelling in Bois Jacques is frighteningly realistic.  A Must Own.
B00004ZD69|5.0|To some people, this album will be worth 5 stars. To some it won't even scrape 2. To some it'll be off the scale. <BR>This kind of music needs a certain kind of person to appreciate it. Like listeners of Australia's The Avalanches, you'll either pick up on the subtleties or it'll go right over your head.<br />To me, however, this album is...amazing. I've never heard anything like it. There's an extemely spontaneous yet organised feeling throughout it, almost as if the band made up the songs as they were going. Who knows, maybe they did? This is not a bad thing, however. To me there's nothing worse than an over-refined bit of artwork/music, and this is pretty raw as albums go. If you can't stomach rare though, be careful about this one.<br />There seems to be about 6 actual songs on this double-CD - two songs on the first \\"song\\", one on the second, two on the third and one on the fourth. The rest of it seems to be interlude between them. The first (which, as far as I can gather, is entitled \\"Lift Yr Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven\\") starts quietly, gathering up to a roaring crescendo of guitar, trumet and jangly-sounding drumming, which somehow doesn't seem to climax despite the ear-splittingness of it. This leads straight into the second song, \\"Gathering Storm\\", which follows the lines of the first one, but instead of sounding hopeful like its predecessor, it's apprehensive and has an unfinished air about it.<BR>The next couple of \\"songs\\" I don't particularly like, a lot of it is just static buzz and weird samples. The third song, \\"Word Police and Friendly Fire\\", however, is about as different from the first two as you can get. It starts sinuous and angsty, and builds up to a heavy, almost Tool-style scream of guitars and other unidentifiable instruments. This seems to just collapse afterwards and drone out.<br />The second CD starts with a very odd sample of an old man talking. This leads into \\"Monheim\\", the fourth proper song. Depressing to say the least, this song grates a little and is probably the most repetetive of the 6, but it leads into my personal favourite, \\"Broken Windows, Locks of Love\\". Like all the others this is dominated by guitar, and roars up to a climax and ending that is very different from its beginning. There's not really any particular feeling about this song, it's a bit of a mix between hopefulness and hopelessness.<br />The sixth song, \\"She dreamt she was..\\" begins very slowly and quietly like the others, but instead of building up to a height, it seems to start right in the middle of one and then winds down to a slow, sad ending that reflects its beginning. <br />Overall this is not a happy CD. There are moments that are happy, and some of the samples might even make you laugh, but even the semi-cheerful songs have a depressing air about them, like the false cheerfulness of someone who's dying. The best way to sum this CD up would be in the words of the band themselves, or whoever wrote the liner notes: \\"We dedicate it to every prisoner in the world...(we dedicate it to empty streets at dawn.)
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina aguleria's new album stripped is so good. I felt like I was falling in love with her vocie for the first time all over again!! I love every song on the album but I just want to talk about a few.<br />Walk Away- bluesy, Fiona apple like haunting piano ballad, Christinas voice is so powerful on this track!<br />Dirrty- of course everyone has heard this hot single, with it's bouncy beat and sexy lyrics. I love redmans rap it just makes me wanna get up and go clubbing!<br />Loving me 4 me- sweet love song with a jazzy beat, Christina sounds like the late and great Aalyiah on this tract,it's already becoming on eof my favorites<br />Immposibe- Christina rips on this song, and I love the cute interaction between her and alica keys in the intro.<br />Beautiful- Truly one of the most beautiful songs on the album, I cried when I first heard it, where was this song when I was a pre-teen?!<br />Make over- Reminds me of something Beck would do, it's funky and I like it.<br />I'm OK- oh my gosh this is such a personal song for Christina I give her so much credit for being so honest and vunerable about her family troubles.<BR> I suggest everyone go pick up this album. It has substance and is actually worth your money. I'm a huge christina fan so I was going to buy it any way, but If you've never really been a fan you will be after you hear this album!!!!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|And this one is - unlike the other \\"Summer Blockbuster\\" Spiderman - which my daughter and I found depressing in tone.<br />MIBII was fun - sure it was similar to the original - but so what? It was still fun, well acted (OK, no Oscars for this kind of movie - but NOT BORING like Star Wars 2!...) and did I mention FUN?!<br />I go to a movie to be entertained.  This movie accomplished that.<br />When I left Star Wars 2 and Spiderman I did not feel similarly entertained.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Three years after her first album Christina Aguilera has finally released her sophmore album.  It is most definitly worth the wait.  Christina has grown as an artist and has begun to show what she's really about through her music.  She sings about everything from her ex to an abusive father.  Her voice is as amazing as ever.  Unlike her prior albums she does not feel the need to hit every note in the book because the music is just so much better.  She has definitly grown with her fans and probably will gain many more.
0060934913|4.0|Anthony Bourdain has written a &quot;tell all&quot; of sorts of the inner workings of the restaurant business. Packed with colorful people he's worked with over the years at times you'll feel like you're reading about characters from the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot;, and not sous chefs and bread makers for some of New Yorks finest eateries. Bourdain seems as comfortable with the pen as the knife, and his stories are funny,insightful, and sometimes downright shocking. Tips on what days not to eat fish, and why brunches are never a good thing round out a particularly great chapter, as well as his recounting of a &quot;day in the life&quot;. For people who've never worked in a restuarant this may be eye opening, to those who have they'll be nodding their smiling heads in agreement with how much they relate to.
0790729725|3.0|Goodfellas has to be one of the great Mob movies ever, alongside the Godfather and Godfather II. However the DVD isn't all that great, mainly due to the utter lack of extras on it.<br />If you HAVE to have this movie, then I suggest you go ahead and get it. Other wait for a Special Edition to come out, which hopefully will come soon.
B00006LLNU|5.0|If I could explain in words what Sigur Ros is doing, I would be much more convincing. In a time when music needs saving more than anything in the world, in the world we live in now with enough war and money power to kill the best in anyone, Sigur Ros slow it down. It's so clear that you almost miss it completely. A child being born, letting go, starting over, realizing that music truely is the answer for everything, music could save the world. I have faith in music, it still means something. Somewhere in the moans and wails of whatever the hell they're saying is this incredible idea of how to re-create music, but it's so simple. It's almost as if it were written by a child, and played by ghosts. It's hard to say if this is better than anything previous. I haven't decided yet, but I can tell you that it's hands down the best album of the year so far, it has a pulse that's stronger than everything else. It's the most excited I've been about an album since the release of OK Computer. Listen hard, even if you don't know what is going on. Tracks 4 and 8 are incredible, and the way that everything seems to build into something and then leave you hanging at the top. They have you right where they want you. Play this all the way through once, without interruption, before you start skipping tracks.
B000068QY7|4.0|Funny thing about Heathen Chemistry. When I first listened I thought it was a great album. But now, after a couple of months, it's just a good album.<br />Most, if not all, of the songs are solid. Most notable is the quantum leap Liam's songwriting skills have taken since SOTSOG. Although one has to wonder if this is due to the production.<br />In any event, this album does have it's gems. &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; is a great opener (Oasis does have a knack for making great opening tracks). And &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; and &quot;Little by Little&quot; are classic Oasis ballads. But in the end, this album will probably be looked at as a Middle Of the Pack album; not their best, but certainly not their worst. Just...in the middle.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Just the fact that there is a new album out with the word \\"Nirvana\\" on the cover drops my jaw. It's been about 5 good years since speculation of the supposed \\"Nirvana box set\\" started. That's a long time. A damn long time if you're a damn big fan. What was originally expected of this package is not what it came out to be. In truth, it is a compromise, set up by the record company due to the overwhelming demand and the leak of \\"You Know You're Right.\\" What fans expected is what should have been released, being there is no rare material on this record outside from \\"You Know You're Right,\\" save for the Scott Litt remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" and perhaps the Blew EP rendition of \\"Been a Son.\\" Even still, both of these songs have already seen light of day, rare or otherwise. The biggest fans have heard them. That being said, it's still nice to have them on an official album release, but where are the other rare tracks? ...The b-sides? The alternate takes? The demos? Even the most sought after rare songs like \\"Sappy\\" and \\"Marigold\\" couldn't find their way onto this disc. <BR> <BR>Now, I will get to the good stuff. The truth is, this album is not all it was expected to be. It is a \\"best-of,\\" in essence, but WHAT a \\"best-of!\\" It encompasses some of Nirvana's finest work and narrows it into a clean, precise retrospect that Nirvana sorely deserved. A \\"best-of\\" should have been released years ago, though, admittingly, it would not have been the same without \\"You Know You're Right.\\" I'm glad to have it at last. And I am gsd that at least a few rare tracks are now on an easy-to-find official release. DGC surely could've left those out, and they were using their heads in including these tracks, making for somewhat of a new listening experience, as opposed to the old-fashioned, generic \\"greatest hits\\" package. Plus, with this talk about rare tracks being released in the future, who knows what may still come fourth. I just hope there isn't another 5 year waiting point involved. Surelythere doesn't have to be after the court battles were finally settled and, of course, after this new record has been released. I can't see why they'd stop now. Hopefully, they won't.<BR>  <BR>  It's good to know that Nirvana is now being given due attention after all this time. Its even better to know that the fans now have something to whet their appetite until the rarities package is released. As powerful now as it ever was then, this record makes for a comprehensive and thoroghly enjoyable listen from one of modern rock's most significant and accomplishing bands. <BR>  <BR>  Flower-sniffin kitty-pettin baby-kissin corporate rock... goodness.
B00006ADFL|5.0|This is actually one of the best films I have seen in recent memory.<br />For one thing, the visual affects are breathtaking and startling.  Watching them really made me feel like I had entered the world of the two main characters.<br />The second thing that blew me away was Kate Winslet's performance.  I have been a fan of Kate's since  'Sense and Sensibility'.  Although 'Heavenly Creatures' predates 'Sense', I viewed 'Heavenly Creatures' afterwards.  This performance proved to me that Ms. Winslet is one of the most capable actresses of my/our generation.<br />Lastly, this was my introduction into the mind of Peter Jackson, the director who would later give us 'The Lord of the Rings.'  The fact that this is also based on a true story gives additional credit to the director's vision -- Mr. Jackson was able to weave the harsh reality bits with the fantastic journeys into these teens' imaginations in a very convincing fashion.<br />Like I said this is one of the best films I have seen in a while and I highly recommend it!
B000001DZM|5.0|The CD opens with a song meant for camp purposes.  But, you know it's a guilty pleasure because you'll start singing along too!  We're all allowed.<br />The variety of songs on this CD is wonderful.  From jazz to folk to disco to modern remixes of those old dance hits--you will not be disappointed.<br />As you can see, there are a lot of tracks and the CD is worth it!  It's a great disc for parties and other fun activities.<br />During my cassette days, I wore out the tape.  Now that I have a CD player, I can play the disc over and over and over as many times as I want.  I still catch myself singing &quot;Can't Help Loving That Man&quot; from &quot;Showboat.&quot;  That's just one of many great songs on this soundtrack CD.

B00006LLNU|4.0|Agaetis Byrjun, the sophmore LP by the Icelandic avant-rock band Sigur Ros, was one of my favourite albums two years ago and so it was no surprise that I bought ( ) the first day it was available. <br />The title of this review says what I think about this album. There are no weak songs on () and it is a very solid effort from a group that must have had expectations going through the roof. However, getting that out of the way, it is also not the most innovative album either. When Agaetis Byrjun was first released to the more mainstream public; most people, having never heard of Sigur Ros before, were stunned by the power and hope-filled sound of Sigur Ros. To be sure, this was more novelty than anything else. But now, with the success of Agaetis Byrjun and the popularization of Sigur Ros across Europe and North America, the novelty of the sound has somewhat faded. My personal hopes was that Sigur Ros would somehow find a way to reinvent their sound (a la Radiohead) while still maintaining some connecting thread to their past. And so, it comes to my slight disappointment that Sigur Ros has made no attempts to reinvent themselves whatsoever. This album isn't anything new: it feels like a sadder companion to Agaetis Byrjun. <br />Much has been made of the pretentiousness of this album by recent reviews; reasons being that there are, indeed, no title tracks or even liner notes within its packaging. Sigur Ros has publicly stated, on their website, that they were more concerned with the music than anything else. While the debate will surely continue, my opinion leans more towards Sigur Ros's end. When considering a band, the art should, unquestionably, be secondary to the music. Moreover, we should not condemn a band for having the balls to play with the system; after all, don't we live in the age of post-modernism? Besides, looking past the art and the structure of the album (with the 30-second break in the middle of the album that critics will surely use to further their argument of pretention), it is, in the end, still a very beautiful and moving album: certainly nothing less than its very own predecessor.  <br />The best track of () is undoubtedly the pop-song (track 8). Sigur Ros has been performing it at their concerts and leaving audiences stunned. This spectacular track is very much in the spirit of Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Explosions in the Sky and fans of those bands should buy this album if only for this one track. Compared to the best 'build-up' songs that Mogwai, GYBE and Explosions have to offer, this track is king. The final 3-4 minutes of this CD is one of the most beautiful 'high' moments I've ever listened to: guitars are going, drums are beating and in the foreground, Jonsi's voice screaming in anguish for something and then....BANG! An explosion of noise and Jonsi's voice fades from foreground to background as the music swallows the listener into a cacophony of sound- it simply has to be heard LOUD! Be forewarned: Your hair might start rising and your heartbeat will most certainly increase, but all worth the trip. <br />All in all, a great effort plus one absolutely incredible song from a band that has rightly been given full artistic control from the machine that is MCA. It's more of the same but, then again, who's complaining?
B00000F566|5.0|Ok! I absolutely love this movie! It has every aspect of a great movie(for me at least) Great music, true love, drama, and lots of fun! This movie, has had my heart since I saw it as a small girl on tv. I bought the movie and I wore it out, kind of. I then decided to buy the DVD and WOW! I was so surprised by how much better it made the film. The film is about Baby and Johnny and how they meet and fall in love in Baby's &quot;last summer&quot; as an adolescent. They fall in love obviously and there are so many aspects about this movie that are just wonderful and lovable. Every character is lovable in their own way! I love Patrick Swayze in this role, he is very sexy and just so dangerous. You know your typical bad boy persona, but you know bad boys, he really isn't, he is a sweet lovable boy in the body of a bad boy. As for Baby, well she is so innocent and child-like that all you wanna do is just hug her! As for Baby's father, i must say some parts of the movie, I just wanted to kick him, but he is a father, and you know dad's. Well, that's about it, it's a great movie!! It's just so hard to explain the effect! Good Luck!
0316666343|4.0|I thought this book was fantastic! I was completely immersed in Susie's (after) life, and whipped through this book in two days. A part of me was sad that it was over. I recommended it to everyone I know, and have a waiting list for people wanting to borrow my copy. The description of Heaven being a place made especially for you, with familiar sights, sounds, and even smells was an idea that provoked an immense feeling of peace within me. Fabulous!
B00006V9A0|4.0|This is definitely what Nirvana fans all around the world have been waiting for. The settelment between Courtney Love and Dave Grohl/ Krist Novolselic has been made, and a month later the greatest hits cd gets released. 'You Know You're Right' has been getting massive airplay for a while, and it seems to be the selling point of this cd. Most of the obvious cuts are here, with no-brainers like 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Come As You Are', 'Heart-Shaped Box' and of course 'You Know You're Right'.<br />A few cuts such as the 'Bleach' version of 'About A Girl' and the Unplugged version of 'All Apologies' were surprising, but very welcome (seeing that the Unplugged 'About A Girl' and the In Utero 'All Apologies' get the radio play, but it was a good move to put the less-obvious choices). 'Been A Son' is another unappreciated song that gets a slot on here too, which I found refreshing. 'Pennyroyal Tea' is another favorite which never got the huge airplay, and that made it on here (it was remixed as well, and destined to be the last single off of 'In Utero' but Cobain's death stopped the promotion of the song as a single. The version on this disc is an unreleased single remix).<br />The only problem with this release that I had was that it was too short, and there were plenty of great Nirvana fan-favorites that could've fleshed this out a bit. 'Aneurysm' was a big live favorite and so was 'School' and definitely 'Polly'. Also 'Muddy Banks From The Wishkah' gets no recognition at all, and 'Bleach' only gets one song. 'Negative Creep' or 'Blew' could've easily been included. <br />I'm sure any Nirvana fan will have his or her own gripes about the cd, but that's what mix tapes and cd burners are for (buy this release, of course). Also of note, the mastering is excellent, and the liner notes are somewhat informative, if not a little thin. Overall this is still a good purchase for a Nirvana novice, or even the seasoned fan or collector.
6305907145|1.0|I'm reminded of small minded 19th century composers &quot;enhancing&quot; Mozart symphonies so they'd be up to date.  Or the Bee Gees' version of Sgt Pepper.  Vandalism, as is this.  PC (so 10 years ago).  A moustache on the Mona Lisa (so 80-years-ago).  What made these Hollywood victims think their little dogmas and anachronisms were improvements on the incomparable genius of Austen's favourite (and possibly most profound) novel?  <br />Missed the point entirely, omitting the highly significant symbolism (eg. Maria's scene at the garden gate).  Generally clueless, extraordinarily annoying, frustrating (such a lot of money down the drain, and we still don't have a decent MP adaption), and insulting.<br />Only thing for it: read the book.  Repeatedly.  You'll be amazed.
B0000640VN|2.0|Okay, so it isn't James Joyce.  It IS an easy to watch, fun fantasy, chick-flick, if you will...  Hugh Jackman makes it worth your time just because he is delicious.  Meg Ryan is just as we remember her from You've Got Mail, same facial expressions and general demeanor, which is not bad, just predictable. Basic plot can be reduced to everyone's fantasy of jumping in the old time machine to go back (or forward) to someone else's era for awhile to check it out.  You won't be disgusted, repulsed, or frightened by this film, because it is clean, clean, clean. Anybody, down to your innocent seven-year-old sister, will go away with something to smile about.  And in these times of terrorists and serial killers, don't we ALL need a bit of that?
B00006CXXU|5.0|Forget about Genie In A Bottle or What A Girl Wants, Christina's new album Stripped is NOTHING like her older stuff. Gone are the bubble gum pop songs and the sweet little girl next door image, and in it's place is a grown up woman who is finally doing her own thing and being herself. This cd is absolutely brilliant, I don't think there is not one bad song on it. Christina's vocals are amazing, she still hits all the right notes but she is not over the top. My personal favorites on the cd are Fighter, Loving Me For Me, Beautiful, Make Over, and of course Dirrty. You simply cannot go wrong with this cd, like I said this is by far the best cd of 2002!!
6305313687|5.0|I'm not a big fan of violent movies, whether it's through blood and guts, fighting, or a state of mind, so I wasn't entirely sure of how I'd feel about this movie.  There were graphic scenes, yes, but I do believe that it's part and parcel of the message that is being sent.  This movie did not end at all how I thought it would, and I was shocked to find myself moved to tears.  Excellent acting, scripting, message.  A must-see.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|It's a laughable animated film for people who love animation. I love it and Mike myers and Eddie Murphy gave real funny performances in this film. Cameron Diaz also gave a good performance as Princess Fiona. It's for all ages. I have to say Eddie Murphy gave the most lovable performance as the talking donkey. It's not disney, it's dreamworks animation. It's a feel good film.
6305841861|5.0|I felt the need to write this review because I Evil Dead II, for it's genre, is one of the top 10 greatest camp-horror movies ever made. This film never takes it-elf seriously... it is meant to be scary and funny, much like several of John Landis's pictures (I.E. American Werewolf in London). What I enjoyed about this picture, besides the creative camera work and the tremendous physical acting by Bruce Campbell (his \\"evil hand\\" scene blows Jim Carrey out of the water) is that Raimi chose to let Ash be the main character, rather than have it be some stupid guy in a hockey mask chop up dozens of kids having sex. You get to spend time with Ash and root for him.
B00006V9A0|5.0|It's been the better part of ten years since Kurt Cobain killed himself, and the music charts are now in a sorry shape. It's only poetic justice, I would think, that Nirvana would suddenly come back to life to send one last single up the charts to show them all how it's done. Accompanying this last single is this excellent compilation - so excellent, in fact, that all the usual criticism reserved for compilations fails to apply. Even the cover is perfect - \\"Nirvana,\\" no other words need be said, the band's name and reputation speak for themselves.<br />Let's face it: Nirvana's albums weren't perfect. Nevermind, for all the ground it broke, was basically a singles album, and In Utero was a deliberate attempt to shed their audience with ugly production and cacophony. But we forgave them their faults thanks to the freshness of the former and the brutal sonic force of the latter - and, of course, thanks to Kurt Cobain's charming insouciance. This compilation, however, collects all the best parts of both. And when I say \\"best parts,\\" I do mean it. All the mainstays are here - \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" \\"Come As You Are,\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" - but so are other songs that one wouldn't have thought likely choices for a compilation - \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"Dumb.\\" Yes, they even included \\"Dumb\\", quite possibly Nirvana's best song ever! \\"About a Girl\\" makes an appearance here too, possibly the result of an attempt to include _something_ from Bleach; I suppose it'd have been better if they had picked the unplugged version, but the unplugged album gets represented here too - the beautiful cover of \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" is here. There are even a couple of relatively obscure gems off Incesticide - the funny childhood story \\"Sliver\\" and the terrific \\"Been A Son.\\"<br />Then there's the new song - \\"You Know You're Right,\\" apparently the last song the band ever recorded. I don't think it's the best song they ever wrote, but it is in a way very definitive - it combines the loud/soft dynamics of Nevermind with some of the more ear-splitting moments of In Utero in the chorus. Cobain's voice in the verses is amazing - the bitterness and proximity to collapse are almost tangible - but it's the bridge to the chorus, in which he simply roars \\"pain,\\" that's really remarkable. It is moments like these in which one understands why Nirvana's music still reaches so many people - with a roar like that with you, you can go take on the world.<br />His great pop talents aside, Cobain was not exactly the second coming of Keats. He was in many ways a product of, and poisoned by, the atrophied anticulture of the ennui-ridden youth of the postmodern age. However, talent will make itself known in any milieu; what made him stand out was his complete awareness of this, his inability to succumb to it or take it lying down, his resulting sadness and rage, and his remarkable ability to convey his emotions, even if his words weren't always clear. Thus we got moments like the wonderfully vicious \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" the melancholy \\"Dumb,\\" the resigned \\"All Apologies\\" or that everlasting anthem of all rejected outsiders, \\"Lithium.\\" And by this alone, it could be said that he left the world he railed against in better shape than when he entered it.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul McCartney has been undergoing a career renaissance since 1997's \\"Flaming Pie\\" and 1999's \\"Run Devil Run.\\"  The former had a definite Beatle vibe, and with Jeff Lynne producing, had his trademarks all over it.  The latter disk was mostly covers of early rockers.  On \\"Driving Rain\\" we see Paul moving on, but retaining, the memory of his beloved Linda.  Many of the songs are simple declarations of his feelings toward his new muse, Heather Mills.<br />The disk is by turns spare, gritty, melancholy and joyful.<br />\\"Lonely Road\\" features a nice rhythm and a strong vocal turn by Paul. The opening lyric says it all, \\"I tried to get over you, i tried to find something new, but all I could ever do, was fill, my time, with thoughts, of you.\\"  Simple but powerful.<br />\\"From a Lover to a Friend\\" has a personal feel, with a light piano touch and interesting chord changes.  This is the rebirth song.<br />\\"She's Given Up Talking\\" has a haunting melody, with Paul's loudspeaker vocals and fuzz bass.<br />\\"Driving Rain,\\" kicks it up a notch and brings some bouyancy and pop-lite to an otherwise fairly heavy collection.<br />\\"Your Way\\" features a country/blues twang, and almost sounds like there's a ghost of George Harrison in the background.<br />\\"Heather\\" has the longest instrumental intro of all the songs, a nice piano track and interesting counterpoint.<br />\\"Riding into Jaipur\\" is another sort of Beatle's homage, with sitar-like sounds and an eastern feel.  \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" has a dark, urgency and beautiful lyrical imagery.  There's even a bonus track, \\"Freedom,\\" Paul's post-9/11 anthem, that should be experienced in his live show.<br />Most of the songs drop you right in, with little musical introduction, which although jarring, gives the tunes more energy and intensity.  While the middle sags a bit with some fill and soundalike songs, the album remains strong throughout.  I'm looking forward to the live disk, \\"Back in the U.S.\\"
B00005JKJA|5.0|It is great to have this film on DVD, as it is somewhat long.   Pause the film to attend to household distractions, as this is the type of film one must pay close attention too, to fully enjoy and appreciate.
0743216458|5.0|Was a great book, too bad Ambrose \\"borrowed\\" from other writers. Oh- well, hes dead now. Great book, even if he was a Plagiarist.
6305508550|4.0|This film had me chuckling the first time I saw it.  However I changed jobs and the movie made sense.  If you have not worked in a place that has inane managers, not to metion if you have more than 1 that you report to, psychotic co-workers (Milton is my favorite)then you won't get this movie.  I lived as Peter at my last job.
0788789813|5.0|\\"One Ring to rule them all,<BR>     One Ring to find them,<BR>     One Ring to bring them all,<BR>     and in the darkness bind them\\"<br />With the Hobbit as an introduction, The Fellowship of the Ring is the first volume in the J.R.R. Tolkein epic adventure trilogy. The story tells about how in the ancient times of Middle-Earth, when Rings of Power were crafted by the mystic elven smiths. The Dark Lord, Sauron forged the One Ring of Power to rule them all. But the Ring was taken from him and fell into the unsuspecting hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. His adventures are told in the Hobbit. However Bilbo grows old and decides he needs to leave his home in the Shire. The Ring is then given to his nephew, Frodo Baggins. Now Frodo has been thrown into a perilous journey across Middle-Earth to destroy the Ring before it falls back into the evil hand of its master. Many join Frodo in his quest and form the Fellowship of the Ring.<br />I enjoyed reading this book. It is definitely one of the best books I have read. Fantasy novels are one of my all time favorites to read. I will admit that there were some parts in the book that seemed abstract and monotonous; But what book doesn't have its boring parts? Even so, what I find boring, others may find interesting. My favorite part in the book was when the Fellowship was formed at the Council of Elround in the Elven land of Rivendell. A group of nine was gathered to help protect the Ring, to alleviate the burdensome journey of Frodo and to keep him company. The Fellowship consists of each race of Middle-Earth: humans (Strider/Aragorn, Gandalf, and Boromir), elf (Legolas), hobbit (Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam), and dwarf (Gimli). Together they must keep the Ring Bearer safe and return the Ring to the pits of Mordor to be destroyed.<br />In December of 2001, the movie \\"The Lord of the Rings; The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was released into theaters. To my surprise I found the book to be quite accurate as far as the book goes. Themovie was also a good visual aid for all the scenes in the book that were hard to understand and follow. It definitely brought the book alive for me...
B00000BKE1|4.0|Some hate this album, some love it, some think it's so-so. So Adrian left the band and the production isn't the best ever... but for you who hate this album, just imagine that this cd isn't by Maiden, imagine it's by some unknown band and you'll like it. Songs reviews and more (song-by-song reviews are so much fun, aren't they?):<br />1. Be Quick or Be Dead: Good opener, one of Maiden hardest and famous songs. Released as a single. 4/5<br />2. From Here To Eternity: Holy Smoke part II... melodic and heavy at the same time. Released as a single. 4/5<BR>  <BR>3. Afraid To Shoot Strangers: the first 3 minutes are almost hypnotizing, then it's go heavy... concidered to be one of Maiden best songs. 5/5<br />4. Fear Is The Key: DO NOT listen to the bad reviews, this song is G-R-E-A-T! listen to it in the dark, with the headphones on and this song will leave you with a mysterious feeling. Maybe the most underrated song by Maiden. 5/5<br />5. Childhood's End: Good lyrics. Good music. Good song, even though it sounds like a filler... 4/5<br />6. Wasting Love: A very different track by Maiden... I really like this song, I think it's really sweet and the lyrics are very mature. 4.5/5<br />7. The Fugitive: A very good song. Good music. The atmosphere works very well here. one of Maiden's most underrated tunes. 4.5/5<br />8. Chains of Misery: Sounds like a filler, but it's a very fun song to listen to. A very good filler track. 3.5/5<br />9. The Apparition: Ask all Iron Maiden fans which song is their worst... 80% of them will say \\"The Apparition\\" and I'm one of them... 1/5<br />10. Judas Be My Guide: Pure heavy metal. Short song, 3:08, but very energetic, with a great catchy chorus and a great solo. 4/5<br />11. Weekend Warrior: It's cool at the first time you listen to it, but I started to get sick of it real quick. conciders to be one of Maiden's worst tracks... 3/5<br />12. Fear Of The Dark: One of the best and most famous from Maiden, and maybe one of the best songs ever...5/5<br />Average rating of all songs: 4 stars...
B00006V9A0|3.0|True as it may be that this album gives listeners the newly released \\"You Know Your Right\\" recording; the album as a whole leaves a lot to be desired by any heartful Nirvana fan.  Money might be better spent on \\"Insesticide\\" or \\"Bleach\\".
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's, \\"Stripped\\" is the vehicle that displays her wide vocal talents in an array of genre:  Jazz, Blues, Pop, Rock, R& B and Hip Hop.  This CD is reminiscent of Mariah Carey and will catapult her to Queen of Pop music.  Every song is a potential top 20 hit on any billboard chart.<br />Christina has grown up and experienced life and branched out into her own despite negative criticism from fans, reporters and the music industry.  Her sentiments are expressed in \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"; \\"Fighter\\"; \\"Soar\\"; and \\"Beautiful\\".  There are beautiful ballads: \\"Walk Away\\" has a lovely jazz and blues influence which she absolutely 'kills'.  \\"Infatuation\\" is a lovely, romantic, sexy song with a flamingo, Latin beat.  \\"Impossible\\" captures the Motown era with the rich instrumental and her full vocals. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" is a beautiful vocal arrangement with a rich R&B sound. <br />Her most personal song on the CD is \\"I'm O.K.\\".  The music is very haunting and is perfect because it gives the feeling of being afraid.  She sings about the physical abuse she and her mother experienced at the hands of her father.  Bruises fade but the memories remain.<br />Christina also takes chances with \\"Make Over\\" and dives into early 70's Go, Go music which I absolutely loved.  The Drums and Guitar just drives this song with such richness along with her vocals.  It's a true work out with a different vocal sound.  \\"Fighter\\" is Rock guitar driven and her vocals do not get lost . <br />Christina Aguilera has definitely left \\"Disney Land\\" and has entered the \\"Real World\\". She gives her instrument a true work out and covers all spectrums of music genres while giving us a look into the real Christina completely \\"Stripped\\" without the gloss, hype or pretense.  Love It!
B00005Y228|4.0|The dimunitive Aussie Pop diva returned in late 2001 with one of her most exciting recordings in years with the infectious, Can't Get You Out Of My Head. Combining a strixing mixture of electro-funk and what equals to out and out pop, the track saw Kylie enjoy her biggest hit single Internationally in many years. This exciting number set the tone for her album Fever, which   featured admitedly formulaic though equally enduring pop numbers that are energetic, coated with firm, concentrated vocal performances from its star even though the vast majority of the album contains her voice being synchronised to add that effective club feel. The entire album is crammed full of potential hit singles. The upbeat, energetic, Burning Up, features Kylie giving a sassy performance as does the electro-pop sounds of the albums title track, Fever. Dance Floor actually gives a subtle reminder of her past as the product of Stock,Aikten &amp; Waterman, proving that her work is every bit as pop as it always was but yet somehow more stylised and Kylie certainly carries this off with finesse proving that her vocal abilities have improved since those days. Love At First Sight and the trance-like In Your Eyes are two outstanding pop cuts that enjoyed club and commercial success in the UK, whilst the almost hypnotic, Fragile displays Kylies growing versatility as an artist. Particularly catchy is also the well-crafted Give It To Me and the sultry Come In To My World. <br />This album undoubtedly has gained Kylie a new generation of fans as well as retrieving some of her old record buyers. As far as Pop music goes, Fever is a rather understated masterpiece. Consistently infectious, highly danceable and bursting out with energy, this is quite possibly Kylies greatest achievement to date. Recommended!
B00005R62N|5.0|On Judas Priest's first live album, Unleashed in the East(1979), they manage to package most of their greatest songs of the period onto one great live album. Every song is a proven winner in the studio, and most sound even better live. The tracks off Sad Wings are greatly aided by Les Binks' fantastic drumming(chekc out that solo in Starbreaker). Glenn and K.K. fire off some sizzling guitar work, while Rob Halford(with some help from the studio) lays down some great vocals. However, Ian Hill begins his descent into mediocrity here, but for the most part his bass  lines are effective and well-played. Overall this is one great albums, arguably the best they ever made, and I would STRONGLY recommend you buy this album first if you're new to the band.
B000002P5W|5.0|This review is for the 1997 MCA Experience Hendrix version of AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE. Axis was Jimi Hendrix's second album and was a masterpiece of studio technology of the day. If you read the liner notes of this MCA version of this classic album, you get to understand that the sounds recorded on this disc were achieved by stretching the technology of 1968 to it's utmost limits. What Jimi Hendrix and his engineer Eddie Kramer were able to achieve with 4 track analog tape recorders was nothing short of remarkable. All that said, this version of AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE leaves a lot to be desired. True, the sound is considerably cleaner than the 1993 MCA CD version (which was mastered by Allen Douglas), but this particular version of AXIS does not have the same vibrancy as the 1984 Japanese Polydor CD pressing. The liner notes of the 1997 MCA Experience Hendrix version are real good, but I liked the liner notes on the 1993 MCA version better, and the album cover of this version has been altered to suit the CD format, instead of honoring Jimi's artistic desire to show a full length picture of his Indian motiff, (the Japanese Polydor CD has the original cover format). All of these quibbles aside, AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE is a great album that deserves to be in every rock and roll CD collection.
B000063V8R|4.0|I love the ST:TNG cast, but when it originally aired I never did get to see all of the episodes. I can't rate just one season, because all the years it spent on the air I have enjoyed. I purchased this collection for two reasons: (a) I can watch ALL the episodes in chronological order [as they aired], and (b) so that I can watch it again and again. The bonus features that are included with the boxed sets adds to the interest I have in the show. Some people may not enjoy behind the scenes featurettes because it could detract the excitement of the story, but it's the opposite for me -- it adds to the enjoyment.<br />Because the collection is distributed on DVD it will display great picture quality as I'm sure the producers intended to be. It also won't wear down as quickly as tapes do, which is a good thing for those who like to watch and watch and watch until it's engrained into the subconscious. I think it's worth the money spent.
B00000K19E|1.0|Aside from some amazing special effects this movie was poorly directed, poorly acted and poorly written... it was so bad that no one could even consider it for an Oscar. <br />It's great for high school kids and anyone who watched \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\\" and was blown away by Reeve's performance of a moron.. which wasn't that hard because he plays one in real life. <br />If you like things that look \\"cool\\".. you'll enjoy this. It has some pretty neat visual and sound effects.. but in the end.. it's all \\"eye candy\\" and a stupid story that doesn't make a bit of sense. <br />If you have high standards in great filmwork.. go see something else.
B00005Y228|5.0|... This is a great album! I personally could do without More More More, but all of the other songs are great ear candy. Dancefloor and the ubiquitous Can't Get You Out of My Mind were written by 80's dancefloor diva Cathy Dennis (Just Another Dream, Move to This) and deserve a place among the best dance tracks this year. If you have the choice, go for the enhanced CD with bonus tracks. This includes Butterfly, a great ephervesant song screaming for remixing.
B000000OSG|5.0|Guns n' Roses, second album(s), the Use Your Illusion albums, were truly giant undertakings, containing 30 songs and 152 minutes of music. Use Your Illusion II is the slower, quieter, more thought-out counterpart to Use Your Illusion I. More ballads are on this one( four, as opposed to two on I). The songs are usually longer, and only two songs on II are true throwaways(Get in the Ring and the truly TERRIBLE My World). The longer songs on II seem to be the better ones, as evidenced by Civil War, Breakdown, Locomotive and Estranged, all awesome cuts. The shorter You Could Be Mine, Shotgun Blues and Pretty Tied up all deliver big as well, as does the Izzy-sung 14 Years. The second version of Don't Cry, which being somewhat pointless is still a great song like it was on UYI I. Overall this is definitely the equal of I and in some areas exceeds it. Both Use Your Illusions should be bought together as a unit(these really should have been a double album- just take out the 5 duds and youve got one of the greatest albums ever). The Use Your Illusion albums are not for the newcomer to G n'R(pick up Apetite first instead) but if you can handle them, don't hesitate to pick these up.
B00004SC3M|2.0|I never wanted to see the movie in the first place with I just ended up seeing it because I thought Catherine Zeta Jones was hot at the time and I just wanted to see her in action. Well... the movie [is bad]! Sean Connery is wonderful, as usual and Catherine Zeta Jones does a good job but the chemistry between the two is terrible and the characters are meaningless. Some of the things that happen in the movie don't need to happen but end up happening. And what bothered me was how the movie consistently had this sensuality that teased you (for example: when Sean Connery stole all her clothes, did he have to steal all her clothes and walk in on her while she's sleeping? They show her but the shadows are covering her nudity. Another example is when Catherine Zeta Jones is lying in bed and half of the blanket is covering her nudity, just enough to cover. Why not show her naked?! Everybody would love to see it!)<br />Anyway, the movie [is bad]. The dialogue is [bad] but the best part is watching Catherine Zeta Jones in action.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Please, do not be fooled by the first single \\"Dirrty\\" for it doesn't do justice to the other fine tracks on this CD!! X-Tina is back, with an eclectic sound and look; that ultimately, confirms her longevity as an artist, and proves the nay sayers wrong. STRIPPED succeeds because it is passionate, deeply personal, and innovative--something desperately lacking in p0p music.  Christina's secret weapon: pairing up with talented producers Alicia Keys and Linda Perry (ex- 4 NON BLONDES.)  Alicia Keys adds her distinct touch to a soulful ballad called \\"Impossible.\\" ( one of the best songs on the cd!) Also, the songs Linda Perry did with Christina display a much welcomed edge:  <br />\\"MakeOver\\" --a trippy statement of personal EMPOWERMENT<BR>\\"Cruz\\" --displays a feeling of FREEDOM!<BR>\\"Beautiful\\"--boldly states LOVE and PRIDE for ones self<BR>\\"I'm OK\\" --Delicately deals with healing PERSONAL pain<br />Stripped is definitely an emotional journey that reveals some of Christina Aguilera's depth and complexity as an artist, and as a woman. It's a beautiful record. Delighted skeptics will abound.
0385484518|4.0|Dear Reader,<br />   I had to read this book for my Sociology of the Family course.  At first I was not excited about having more to read.  However, from the moment that I picked up the book, I could not put it down.  Morrie's perspectives on life were so refreshing to read.  The book helped to remind me that the true measure of a person's worth can be seen in the character of his/her friends and family.  It is easy to become so caught up in daily life and forget those people around that truly matter.  <br />    This book may not change your life, but it will certainly get you thinking about it.

B00006AW2P|3.0|Thank mike-on-the-mike for your review.  I was thinking I was the only frustrated stones fan that wanted all the early songs without buying so many cd's that constantly overlap the same songs.  And with today's cd technology, something special should be done for such a special band like the stones.  Give us more for the buck then just 30 minutes on a cd AND then repeat some of the same songs on the next cd (i.e. Between The Buttons & Flowers).  What a rip off.  I will pay good money for something like a Rolling Stones Box Set (6 or 7 cd's), of simply the first songs released before mid 1967.  The LP'S DON'T MEAN A THING.  WHAT MATTERS ARE THE SONGS.  I WANT THE SONGS ON CD, WITHOUT BUYING SO MANY LP'S ON CD.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Casino Royale is hilarious bond spoof produced during the time while Sean Connery was still playing James Bond in the regular Bond films.  It has a remarkable cast of stars, including David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, and a young 32 year old Woody Allen.<br />The film suffers from a certain amount of discontinuity, which having only seen it on TV in the past, I took to be an artifact of it being edited for television.  The extra material provided with the DVD, an interview with director Val Guest, explains why this is (I won't spoil it for you).  Keeping these behind-the-scenes facts in mind, makes the movie even more entertaining.<br />I probably laughed more as I child when I watched this movie, but I certainly get more of the jokes as an adult.  It's also great fun to take a trip back in time and see these classic actors spoofing the Bond image.  I give Casino Royale 4 stars for nostalgia and goofy fun.
B00006LLNU|4.0|But not as good as the last one.  The sound is a lot more spare, not so massive and enveloping.  They sound a little more like mogwai on this disc.  A lot more subtlety, and the tracks sort of blend together.  Overall, this is still sigur ros (how do you pronounce that?) so it is pretty awesome.  I like the fact that they didn't name the tracks or cd.
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's book To Kill A Mockingbird delves into a small town in the rural south and examines the role that prejudice plays amongst the inhabitants.  The story as told from a young girl's point of view has light moments that are filled with the joy of playing with childhood friends and her sibling, Jem.  However, as the story progresses Scout is faced with the concerns that her classmates and neighbors have over her father, the town's most prominent lawyer, representing an innocent black man in a rape case against a white woman.  Racist people in their everyday lives confront Scout and her brother Jem and they must learn how to react to their hateful remarks.  Scout realizes the discrimination that many black citizens face in their everyday lives for the first time.  She doesn't understand the weight that her father's case has in both the families' and the town's everyday activities.  Scout begins to understand her father's kind and respectful nature and begins to respect more as an upstanding and moral citizen.<BR> To Kill A Mockingbird is set during a time that most young readers' parents and grandparents reflect upon as a time with a tremendous communal bond.  The wonderful sense of community takes the reader back to a time in our history where neighbors cared about each other.  However, it also brought back to life the very real prejudices that many African-Americans were faced with during the era of the depression.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story and appreciated the glimpse of the not so distant past that it provided me with.
076790592X|5.0|This book teaches you a lot about life. More importantly, how to &quot;live.&quot; We need to stop and take notice of life's simple pleasures and ask ourselves if we're truly happy with what we've accomplished and done thus far. Morrie is a great person, who changes people's outlook on life. I really enjoyed reading this book and have recommended it to all of my friends and family.
B00005RDAE|2.0|You'd think that by this VHS/DVD being titled \\"Britney: The Videos\\", you'd find nothing more, nothing less than a good set of 10 videos (at the time) done by Britney Spears.  That is the reason I added it to my wishlist to begin with, but I was completely disappointed when it arrived.  Sure, it has \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", but that's not enough.  <br />Besides the three videos, you will see Britney pose infront of a camera for a photoshoot for about 5 minutes.  You will also see a live performance of \\"Overprotected\\" from the movie \\"Crossroads\\", and behind the scenes footage of the same.  Personally, I was not interested in any of these things.<br />The only two things I enjoyed from this VHS were the IAS4U video and the full length version of her first Pepsi commercial and the performance of IAS4U at the 2001 Video Music Awards (somewhat).  Although all of these parts of the VHS are great, they are not enough for me to give this tape more than the rating I selected.<br />Not to mention this VHS is incredibly short... merely over 30 minutes.  When I buy a VHS, I expect it to be atleast an hour, and in this case, being that the artist was Britney Spears, full of entertainment.  But, it wasn't the case.
B00006LLNU|5.0|There was no such word for describe this third album from Sigur Ros.Touching,Stunning and more...first three track keep your hearth and you can breathe with any probelm ,then the Njosnavelin(4th) set free in the air ...(Director Cameron Crowe is a great man)<br />From 5 track something change...seems became bore but isn't , is only a long hypnotic prelude to the vulcanic 8 track where you can see dark landscape cut by light and vapors for floating like in to a eruption...<br />Takk to exist...my life have a new sense a new certainy...
0553213105|5.0|I read this book quite a while ago, in fact when i was in year 9 and my older sister was studying it for GCSE, i saw the book and seeing as i was bored i decided to read it. to my surprise i actually liked it. it turned out to be very interesting and amusing at times too. the relationship between Darcy and Lizzy interested me very much as i found Lizzy's retorts and critical behaviour great as i am a great believer of speaking your views. For Lizzy to do that in that kind of society was very brave of her and i admired her for it. Since then i have read this book so many times it's unbelievable and it still interests me greatly. i never get bored with the storyline and i live along with the characters and feel for them as if i was reading the book for the first time. It's an absolute classic and i love it. i really recommend everyone to read it. don't be put off by the fact that it is set in old times. U will be pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually great.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought the CD a few hours ago and I can't stop listening to it. I love every one of the songs! Christina has true talent as opposed to commercial talent and you can tell she has really matured since her last album. If you want fast songs, you won't like this CD. But other than that, I would recommend buying it for sure.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|There are a lot of good things to say about this wonderful movie, but the songs have to be at the top of any list.  Almost every song is among Disney's very best.  The only exception, \\"Human Again\\", is one that was re-inserted for this edition, having been cut for theatrical release -- it's not a bad song; it's just not up to the amazing standard of the others.   The arrangements are operatic in their complexity and the lyrics are flawless: by turns witty, moving and engaging.  \\"Be Our Guest\\" has got to be most dazzling single performance in a Disney picture; the title song won an Oscar; and \\"Gaston\\" would have been the best song in almost any other movie.<br />The story is one of the good old fairy tales, going back beyond Perrault to the 16th century and probably before.  Belle's father is trapped in an enchanted castle by a monstrous beast, who is really a handsome prince cursed by a good sorceress because of his evil temper.  Belle offers herself in her father's place, and you can guess the rest.  The story is well-done; the cast is uniformly excellent, though Angela Lansbury stands out with a terrific characterization of Mrs. Potts, the teapot.  The reproduction is beautiful.<br />There is also a set of extra features on the second DVD.  My seven-year-old daughter went through the \\"Mrs. Potts' Personality Test\\" in a few minutes and was delighted to discover she resembles Belle more than she does Mrs. Potts or the maid.  She also enjoyed a musical memory game with Chip, the teacup.  There's another game, though, which was a bit of a failure -- \\"Maurice's Invention Workshop Game\\".  You have to get a code from a game on disk 1, which isn't that hard to do, though it took a bit of fiddling around.  Then we got into the game and got up to a point where we had to dodge candlesticks, and found that no matter what we did, we bumped into a candlestick and lost.<br />Oh, well.  But the movie was so good we hardly cared.  Highly recommended.
B000006UNG|5.0|OK, so I was in a record store in Bristol, England, some time in the winter of 1986 and the sales clerk was playing this record. After hearing &quot;Living in Another World&quot; I ponied up the cash for a cassette and listened to it twice while walking back to my flat (it was a long walk). I was instantly enthralled with the record's effortless mix of organic and and electronic sounds and with the fabulous melodies. Ever since, it has been one of my favorite records.<br />BTW, it is a great CD to backpack around Europe with.
B00005RZV4|5.0|\\"And All That Could Have Been\\", Nine Inch Nails long awaited live album was finally released early this year, and surpasses expectations by being one of the finest live albums ever recorded.  \\"Terrible Lie\\", \\"Sin\\", a slower version of \\"The Frail\\",\\"Closer\\", \\"Head Like a Hole\\", and \\"The Day the World Went Away\\" are brought to life live beautifully and sound nearly as good as they're studio counterparts, but the highlight is the live version of \\"Hurt\\" which closes the album (just like it did on \\"Downward Spiral\\") and the song still manages to contain all the emotion and torment of the studio track.  Trent's voice has never sounded better, and his live band excels and never misses a beat.  All in all, even if you own everything NIN, halos and all, this is a must buy.  Check out the live concert DVD too.
B00006F7S4|5.0|The best cd's cannot be judged by an initial listen.  Great music grows on you.  On the first listen of Sea Change I thought, 'Hmmmm... folky, very mellow...and interesting.'  On the tenth listen, I loved it and on the thirtieth, I was in awe. When I first bought Mutations I had a similar impression except I sat that cd down, listened to it six months later and kicked myself for not giving it a chance.     If you are expecting songs like 'Loser,' 'Devil's Haircut' or 'Sexx Laws,' you'll find nothing like that on Sea Change.  What you will find is this unpredictable artist surprising you will thoughtful lyrics, beautiful melodies and as always, interesting instrumentations (with help from Nigel Godrich).  'The Golden Age' is a great introduction but for me, the disc really shines on tracks 4-11.     This may eventually replace Mutations as my favorite Beck disc. If you are a true Beck fan, you cannot do without this disc.  It is that good.
0140277447|5.0|It wasn't just the sheer number of Chinese killed by the Japanese, it was the cruel way many were lit on fire, pierced, disembowled, speared, hacked, etc... with total abandon.  The first few chapters are enough to sicken even those up on their Holocaust literature.  Just when you thought man's inhumanity to man couldn't be worse than it was under Hitler, we back up a few years to 1937 and realize that cruelty has been around forever.  The book would be even more depressing if Chang hadn't decided to focus also on some of the heros who saved hundreds sometimes thousands of Chinese from death and disfigurement.  Although I knew of the rape of Nanking, I had no idea the depth and scope of the slaughter.  Chang could have been more objective, but after reading the book, it is hard to say anything positive about the Japanese behavior.  In another great book, 3 Daughters of China, it's clear that the Chinese had their share of poor behavior as well with the Japanese, but as far as scale, the Rape of Nanking takes the cake.  A tough read content-wise, but an important study.
0618164413|4.0|The first few stories are certainly classics. Further adventures in the book are not as fine, but they certainly do entertain. George is so cute. That darn monkey!
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was AMAZED at the transition Christina Aguilera made from her last album to this one. Not a big fan of teen-pop, I decided to listen to the album on-line before I bought it, and I was SHOCKED. The vocals are fantastic, you can really feel the music. The girl has TALENT!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|BEAUTY & THE BEAST is truly a classic film. The story is timeless, yet relevant (recognizing love & inner beauty, and learning to love unconditionally with \\"no strings attached\\"). The musical score is superb, and as this special edition DVD describes, it's launched an excellent Broadway musical. The characters are adorable and interesting, and the villains are despicable.  When Belle falls in love with the Beast, it's fun to see how they help each other grow -- Belle gains courage as the Beast gains compassion.<br />This platinum edition DVD continues Disney's recent trend of including everything you could ever ask for along with the film, which in this case is truly amazing. There are three versions of the movie included on this 2 disc set; one is the original theatrical release, another is the version which was first shown at the 1991 New York Film Festival (the work-in-progress edition), and the third is the amazing special edition which includes an all-new yet perfectly integrated \\"Human Again\\" scene.  There are also several games and activities for children on this disc, including a really fun one in which you answer questions and are matched up with which character you are most similar to. I also loved the musical game with Chip, which is good fun even for small children (it just involves matching musical notes). Grown-ups will love the Broadway musical featurette, the video with Celine Dion & Peabo Bryson, and all kinds of great \\"making of\\" shorts and documentaries which are simply too numerous to mention here!<br />I was very pleased to see a special section of seven Disney stories which describes the \\"story behind the story\\" of things like Cinderella and the Lion King.  I really love seeing the historical summary of these ancient tales, which also include a fresh and fun film summary of the story that children enjoy, too!<br />I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of musicals, Disney animation movies, or children at heart. It's truly a tale as old as time, which warms the heart and brightens one's day!<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson<br />author of \\"Karen Kimball & the Dream Weaver's Web\\"ime, which warms the heart and brightens one's day!<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson<BR>author of \\"Karen Kimball & the Dream Weaver's Web\\"
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is actually REALLY good. The growth and difference between this CD and her first is unbelievable. There are many different styles of music covered on this album, such as rock, r&amp;b, jazz, BUT it is all very soulful. My favorite track is currently FIGHTER, although I enjoy the entire album. Her voice is very powerful and melodic, and she strayed away from vocal gymnastics...as she no longer needs to establish herself as an actual SINGER. This was long awaited, and it is finally here and well worth the wait. <br />BUY IT! YOU WILL LOVE IT :):):)
B00006V9A0|4.0|Although seen by many as a \\"Best of...\\" album, Nirvana's return is more than just a collection of radio hits.  True, listeners will recognize many of the 14 tracks, but there are some subtle bonuses on this album that should please long time hard-core fans of the Seattle grunge trio as well as the younger new comers.  \\"About A Girl,\\" the only cut from Nirvana's debut album Bleach which is a still relatively unheard and under appreciated album, sounds absolutely clean compared to the original 1989 release and really helps to show the creative and powerful sound and lyrics that are just inherent to this band's body of work.  Also, the decision to include two cuts off of the forgotten Incesticide album before reaching the vastly popular teen angst anthems of Nevermind show that the people at Geffen and all others responsible for putting this album together were really looking to demonstrate the creative brilliance that this band was capable of recording.  Another high point is the remixed version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" which chillingly captures a hauntingly dynamic Cobain.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt though, the piece de rsistance is the previously unreleased \\"You Know You're Right.\\"  Simply stated this song is amazing.  The lyrics and music are liquid gold that impacts the listener like a tidal wave--hitting instantly and with sudden power and then leaving behind a frightening state of altered calm.  Although this collection could have included a few deeper cuts from Nirvana's b-side and live recordings vault, the album is generally satisfying for fans who have been in withdrawal since the 1996 release of From the Muddy Banks of the Wishka.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has definitely shown their full musical talents on this cd. It's an amazing cd, too. While on Parachutes one could definitely trace the thought process of a kind of whiny British boy, Coldplay has added a new dimension to their music. Each song is beautiful and uniquely its own. The weakest song, I think, is &quot;In My Place&quot; which shows how strong the rest of the album is. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;Green Eyes&quot; are my favorites. But there is really something for everyone on the CD. While Radiohead/Coldplay/Travis comparisons will be made until the end of time, Coldplay has definitely broken off, and almost created their own mini-genre of music- &quot;Passionate, accessible, slightly political, British Pop-Rock.&quot; Anyway, my main point is: Buy it. Listen to it. Be it.
B00005JL96|5.0|It is a shame that this superior Disney product was put against the lackluster \\"Scooby Doo Movie\\" and had to fight it out for attention.  If you really want to do yourself and your kids a favor, toss out those discount coupons you got for \\"Scooby Doo\\" and spend full retail on this.  <br />Lilo is a lonely, misunderstood (I wont tell why) girl from Hawaii who needs companionship, a friend, and whose family is hanging on by a thread and being threatened to be torn apart by Social Services (whose agent is a cross between Mr. T and a Man in Black).<br />She finds, through a series of mishaps, a wonderful pet named \\"Stich\\" who also needs some help.  The help Stich needs is way beyond what Lilo can give him- - - at first.<br />Lilo and her sister love each other, Lilo finds love for Stich and Stich doesn't know what love or family really is.<br />If you want a film that mixes laughter, a real solid feeling for family, some great (and well placed) Elvis toons, and a big helping of Science Fiction please get this.  <br />It's not the Disney needs the money. It's that you need the story that this movie tells.
0316666343|4.0|I have read some of the less favorable reviews and do agree w/ some of the things they have said.  Yes, there is an anti-climatic moment, and yes there are a lot of characters mentioned in the book.  However, this is still a good read.<br />Alice Sebold developes a smooth pace w/ her word choice.  When discribing the murder you are sucked in.  There is a matter of fact element and at the same time pure horror that such a thing happened and is being re-told by a teenager.  She captures Susie, a 14 year old pretty well.  There is that part child, part young adult when Susie narrates the goings on in the living world.  Susie has a touch of sarcasm and tenderness when dealing w/ those she left behind.<br />Then there is the heaven Alice Sebold creates.  Completely believable, never once did I question Susie's heaven as being too outlandish.  One thing about the heaven that I didn't understand, however, was Susie's friend Holly.  There is no character development to Holly.  I think Ms. Sebold could've cut her out and just kept w/ Susie's \\"Social Worker\\".  <br />As for the parents and sister and brother Susie left behind, there is belivable character development as the years go by.  Something so tragic that very few can imagine has changed them for the rest of their lives.  The father has to be both father and mother when his wife shuts down emotionally.  Along w/ his daughter Lindsay, he has to deal w/ his feelings of anger and frustration when they believe they know who the killer is, a neighbor.  In fact, there is a very tense scene with Lindsay trying to find evidence to link the neighbor to the killing.  The mother, you just want to smack her sometimes for the life choices she makes because she is unable to deal w/ this tragedy.  Finally, Buckly, Susie's little brother becomes a tween w/ so much maturity and so much anger.  You see the tenderness in Buck, while he watches over his father fiercely and then, like his mother, shut down emotionally when his mother triesto reconnect w/ her son.<br />I don't think the book is too sappy or Lifetime Movie of the Week.  I think it is honest and straight forward.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is Christina Aguilera's best work so far! I mean, it's notable that she put a lot of dedication, hard work, and persistence on it. Obviously, she's one the most talented female vocalists out there right now, with Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, and Whitney Houston running up for the same privileged title too. Something great is that Christina is also a lyricist, composer, producer, and executive producer on STRIPPED, which makes it an even more personal work. With this, she's proving that her voice and styles are very versatile, and that she's already out and far away of the teenybopper world, taking the adult's and grown-up's tastes by storm, and she's certainly gonna satisfy them. She goes from soulful ballads (Walk Away, Impossible, Beautiful, The Voice Within, I'm OK) to hard-core rock/alternative tracks (Fighter, Make Over); from encouraging mid-tempo tunes (Cruz, Soar, Keep On Singin' My Song) to dancy Hip Hop songs (Can't Hold Us Down, Dirrty); and, from funky beats (Underappreciated, Get Mine, Get Yours) to mellow R&B and \\"flamenco\\" styles (Loving Me 4 Me, Infatuation); all that spiced up with some revealing, sexy, and peaceful interludes. Some standups in STRIPPED are obviously Beautiful (a self-esteem giver gorgeous ballad [most likely to be her signature song {2nd single}]), Can't Hold Us Down (a feminist anthem featuring Lil' Kim, based on how some men, including Eminem and Fred Durst, had tried to trash her), Fighter (a rockish and hot song, maybe about how her former manager betrayed her, but how it made her stronger), Infatuation (the story of her first love, her Puerto Rican ex-boyfriend), Impossible (a remarkable ballad written, composed, arranged, and produced by Alicia Keys), Make Over (a Courtney-Love-type song where she states that she doesn't need anybody to make her over), and I'm OK (a sad story about her abusive father, produced by 4 Non Blondes' lead singer, Linda Perry). The other songs are amazing too, just that I only listed the ones with the most personal meaning for her. STRIPPED has collaborations (production, lyrics, music, vocals, etc.) of Scott Storch, Linda Perry, Matt Morris, Glen Ballard, Rob Hoffman, Heather Holley, Steve Morales, Redman, Alicia Keys, Lil' Kim, Rockwilder, Dave Navarro, Ron Fair, etc.. I highly recommend this item because I consider it as a masterpiece. Please don't doubt on buying it, and don't establish a judgment because of her first single (DIRRTY), maybe because of its sexy message and raunchy video, which isn't nothing bad because Christina is a 21 years old lady that wants to have fun as most of the other people of her age. But if you're thinking that her whole album is like that single, think it twice because it's full of really personal and encouraging stuff that'll make you feel delighted; it's a very pleasant CD.
B0000508U6|4.0|Well, I really wish there's a 4.5, because there is definitely room for evolution within Coldplay (Just check out a Rush of Blood to the Head). My one dilemma with this cd is that there is little to no variation in the content and sound of each song. Chris Martin's voice is amazing, but it lends itself to also be a little repetitive. There are AMAZING songs on this album, but they're amazing for the same reasons. &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot; are excellent songs but one feels like they could be the same song; they have the same basic gist. I've owned this album for years, and listened to it countless times but I still have trouble telling &quot;For you&quot; and &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; apart. Blame this on ADD or what have you, but for the most part, Parachutes leaves you wanting more, which is only fully delivered in Coldplay's sophomore cd.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is an incredible album that is difficult to describe. It's like an intergalactic musical set in another time/place.<br />Musically, it is an intriguing mix of rock and pop with a hint of electronica. Somewhere between Radiohead, Battlestar Galctica, The Power Puff Girls, and James Taylor.<br />I give it four delicious stars for music and a final shooting star for the sheer originality of it.<br />Definitely worth many listens and hopefully an inspiration for other artists to be more creative and break the musical mold.
0679457313|5.0|Please, Ms. Roy.  Write another one.  I am not a big reader, rarely do I read more than one or two books a year.  I generally prefer short stories, but this one was special---a wonderful funny and sad intertwining of love and betrayal among family members, about a time and culture unfamiliar to the average American written in the kind of sweet prose you just want to read over and over again. I haven't had a chance to read the negative reviews the last on-line reviewer refers to, but I am imagining they might discuss that it was difficult to get started---probably true, but once you get into it, you will find yourself emotionally attached and unable to put it down
B00006V9A0|5.0|This an amazing cd, i just got it about an hour ago, and i am finishing it as i type this. It has all the hits off the radio, which seems to be the only good music on the radio anymore, and a few extras, like \\"You Know Youre Right\\" and the Scott Litt mix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", which was only on the single that is only available in Europe and which is worth about a thousand dollars. <BR>I also think that the version of \\"Been A Son\\" is the original version from the \\"Blew E.P.\\" There is a picture in the insert that has kurt holding a bass in a studio, and this version of \\"Been A Son\\" has a Bass solo. anyway, \\"All Apologies\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" are from the Famous MTV Unplugged show. It is a great  cd if you are just getting into Nirvana, or if youre a hardcore fan, hell, I have 22 Nirvana cds now. even if you are just getting it because you like \\"You know Youre Right\\", its still worth it. and for those of you who want to hear it live and have access to bootlegs, the song was first played as \\"On a Mountain\\" on October 23, 1993, at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago. Great cd. Long Live Nirvana.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I have been waithing for this cd for a very long time...this cd is really good for a greatest hits compilation, because it is not just their greatest hits.  it is their most powerful and moving songs, including the last nirvana recording, you know you're right as well as tracks from their earlier stuff, unplugged and pennyroyal tea in the single version, the way kurt wanted it.  if you are a longtime fan or a newcomer, just buy it.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|With names like Jay-z, Nas, Xzibit, And of course Eminem would you acually expect less. Also includes new up and coming stars like 50 Cent And Obie Tice. This album has it all trust me you won't reget buying this album.
0790734060|5.0|Please?<br />I was first exposed to this movie when I was in highschool and have loved it from that point on. Amadeus introduced me to the world of classical music, something I'd never been exposed to up until that point. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who's wanting to introduce someone to classical music.<br />Though I didn't know at first how this movie was largely fictional in the relationship between Salieri and Mozart, realizing it later on in no way took away from the beauty of the film itself and the story that is told.<br />Thus far I've owned the VHS version, the original DVD version, and now the director's cut version. This director's cut version sheds quite a new light on the tension between Constanze and Salieri. The scene between the two - which gave this version an \\"R\\" rating - was quite a departure from the original version.<br />There are little bits here and there and even entire scenes throughout that have been added, mostly about Salieri's little schemes against Mozart. Two scenes involve a character who we never even saw in the original, with an actor who is quite famous in his own right. Amazing that they cut his entire scenes right out.
B000002UAC|5.0|This is the album that launched Beatlemania in the U.S.  Well, sort of.  The cover is the same, but this is the U.K. version of the Beatles' second album, which was released only eight months after their debut in March of 1963. The U.S. version (entitled Meet the Beatles) included only nine of these songs and added &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; and its b-side &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; along with &quot;This Boy.&quot;<br />But even though this is not the version that millions of baby boomers (like myself) grew up with, it's still an essential album in the Beatles' catalog.  Among the originals is their best song never released as a single, &quot;All My Loving.&quot; Also Ringo gets a vocal on the song originally given to the Rolling Stones, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man.&quot;  And George Harrison gets his first songwriting credit with &quot;Don't Bother Me.&quot;<br />The Beatles raid the Motown vaults for many of the covers.  &quot;Please Mr. Postman,&quot; &quot;You've Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; are highlights.  The latter features one of Lennon's best vocals. [It wouldn't be until their next album when they released a collection of all original material.]<br />All told, this album catches the Beatles while they are still not too far removed from their Cavern Club and Hamburg days. As such, you hear an urgency and energy in their performance that sets their music apart from the rest of the British Invasion that followed. ESSENTIAL
B000065U1N|3.0|Black Hawk Down is a good war movie, and it portrays the dramas and tragedy, but it is impossible to actually follow the battle.  The book was much better, and I think making this such an action movie is a bit of a disservice to the story.  I think That's just the combination of people involved in making the film, who have a strong background in action movies.  I hope someone retells this story later, in a more subdued sense.  Still, it is an exciting movie and it is worth seeing.
B00006IUL7|5.0|Superb acting from very good actors in the business. This movie is about a detective who goes to solve a murder case but get caught up in a case of his own arising out of accidentally shooting his partner. It seems the dectective played by Paccino has motives for shooting his partner but does he and if he's found out just how will that information be handled. In the end it makes you want to take sides.
B0000640VO|5.0|It's a definitely Jean-Pierre Jeunet film.  You can tell by the film tone.  However, the story is not like he's done before.  You will see the sweeter side of him.  A must see in 2001.
0688170528|5.0|I was amazed at how taken back I was by this book! My best friend and I read it at the same time so we could chat about it! I highly reccomend that you do the same! There are so many things that make you gasp! Praise to the author who has done a wonderful job of reminding us what love is like at age 17!!
B0000640VN|5.0|The only major reason I gave this run-of-the-mill, not likely scifi, romance 5 stars is because of Hugh Jackman.I went to the theater because I have always liked Meg Ryan, especially in romantic comedies. I bought this DVD because Hugh Jackman is utterly charming, charismatic and WOW is he easy on the eyes. I could watch this man read the phone book and it would probably be more entertaining and original than this movie's storyline. Meg Ryan who usually can act, decided not too for this movie. I wish that somebody would have informed Ms. Ryan that her hair looked like it was styled a la weedwacker in this movie(it was very distracting)! Don't get me wrong I usually love Meg in romantic comedies and I love Hugh in anything. The whole cast are good actors, but the script was just average, no new twists or surprises added to make this movie different from any other romantic comedy. How the time travel took place was different but highly questionable, like after jumping off the bridge how do they land in the other time era, on their feet with no impact or in the river, How does Stuart know that when Leopold goes back that he will be repeating the whole day over of when he left, and when Meg's character goes back why does she arrive later that day and just in time? I know that it is just a romantic comedy but....don't introduce and then not explain it.<br />Oh, well. If you want to watch an extremely handsome man then this is the movie. If you want to watch a movie for Meg's acting then this is not it.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is completely amazing! I LOVE Christina's new image and style!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a great film! I am particularly fond of japanese animation but you don't have to like pokemon to appreciate this masterpeice. The story is overall the fight between nature and man and how we need to work together to save the earth. The mystical element of it makes it a great fantasy film and the animation is spactacular. I wouldn't reccomend for very young children because at times it is a little scary, but a great buy most definitly!
B00005JKJA|1.0|...Mulholland Drive was the worst movie I have seen in the past 10 years. This is MST3000 fare.<br />I was a fan of Twin Peaks, and enjoyed its esoteric qualities, but this is purposefully dense and cryptic.
B00006CXXU|5.0|first things first, I didn't like the video for Dirrty, I tought christina was a little over the top, but that's a great song. nevertheless the album is magnificent, starts out strong with a track directed at Eminem and men in general, and christina gets her point across very well, I think you all heard all the things that's been said about christina after dirrty came out, and she's right, a girl should be able to do watever the guys do without having someone labeling them. the album is an emotional rollercoster, in the track &quot;im ok&quot; she sings her heart out over the abuse her mother took from her father, other tracks are about being self centered, and looking ahead about life and yourself, Alicia Keys did wonders with &quot;complicated&quot; I used wished she would have added more vocals to that track.  I not a rock fan, but the rock track with Dave Navarro was ok, and she had a couple tracks that had that Pink type sound from Linda Perry, and of course the emotinal ballads &quot;beutiful&quot; is a great track, I don't think the ballads were as good as &quot;I turn to you&quot; but they were nice. she co wrote most of the tracks, and i got to say this album is a great follow up to her first, actually it's 10 times better, I just hope she doesn't make another video like dirrty, and I'm a guy and I tought it was sleezy. a lot of people who tought they would never like Christina, will probably be amazed on how much she has changed, and will continue to change. after all if your music doesn't get better, why put out albums?
B000060MY6|5.0|David Lynch continues to amaze me with his latest film \\"Mulholland Drive\\", a bizarre journey into psychosis and beyond.   Subliminally, demons are exorcized  while viewing subtle nuances of complete madness that will permeate subconciousness.   This film was totally unpredictable and all of the performances were incredible. One of the defining moments of the film is where Betty fails to heed Coco's warning of the iminant danger in her apartment, she obviously did not get rid of the trouble and consequently, she is taken on a dangerous journey into a downward spiraled path she chose to follow.    There is so much depth and complexity to this film, it is nearly impossible to draw any kind of significant conclusion.  It's like asking someone why they are gay?  So may theories and oppinions but in the end, it all remains subjective.  Can you explain why Betty's shruken mother and father try and scare her to death?  I sure can't, but this adds to the mystery of delusion.  My theory of the meaning of this film is, I compare it to \\"Vanilla Sky\\" and \\"Jacob's Ladder\\". I think the first half of the movie is Diane/Betty's decent into death laced with nightmarish images of her subconsious, and the second half is what actually happened leading up to her suicide?  And was that Betty/Diane actually commiting suicide in the bed?  All of this makes you want to throw \\"the rubik's cube\\" as one reviewer put it, against the wall.  In an ethereal aspect, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a hypnotic film that has a trance like effect on all of your senses.  It soothes, compels, disorients, intoxicates, frustrates, excites, frightens, and teases. A pyschological mind-...that David Lynch orchestrates magnificantly to the open-minded, free-spirited lost souls of the world, in search of truth and meaning.
0141301155|5.0|Forget the movie and read this book instead!  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory takes you on a tour of the world's best, most inventive, most delightful, and most mysterious chocolate factory all from the perspective of a small child (Charlie).  I loved this book as a child and couldn't wait to read it to my daughter.  9-12 year olds can read the book themselves; I read it to my 5 year old and she keeps asking for it over and again.  Her eyes literally grew wide at some of the descriptions and she claimed that she could smell the chocolate in the air as we read.
B00006LLNU|2.0|Agaetis Byrjun, Sigur Rs's last cd, could lull you to sleep. This one, whatever it's called, could put you to sleep.
B00006V9A0|4.0|All the obvious songs are here, it's only a shame that the order is chronological. It makes it seem like Nirvana didn't do that much and I would have much rather having the Nevermind and In Utero songs spread out than having them one after the other.  This album is also missing little-great songs like Polly or Something In The Way that can break the ongoing intensity, especially since Nirvana weren't that varied in style. To me it looks like a Singles collection that smells a lot like Courtney's spirit. I can't personally find much point in buying this album just for a new song that reminds me a of a specific REM song, but no finger pointing, one that I think they actually recorded after Cobain died. I'd recommend this one only to people who already have Nevermind, In Utero and the New York Unplugged, but not Bleach and Incesticide, otherwise, buy these three first. However, if you must get this one, then at least play it on Random. Kurt would have liked that.
0805062971|5.0|I am a huge fan of the movie, so much so that after many of my viewings, I will get into long discussions about the motivations of the character, the intention of the film-maker, and the point of the film.  A friend recommended I read the book and get the author's viewpoints directly.<br />Reading the book may be a bit irritating if you have seen the movie many times, as the movie liberally used dialogue from the book.  However, many differences that make this book worth reading.<br />For one, Marla is a more prominent character.  While the movie portrays Marla as secondary - a distraction from the pursuits of manhood, she is a central figure in the book.  She is the reason why things happen.<br />Lines in the movie that may have seemed like non-sequiturs are given their due in the book.<br />The ending is far more appropriate, and I will not discuss it here.  I will say that I have seen both alternate endings to the film and I prefer the book's ending to all of them.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Let's get this clear, Ms Aguilera is no pop-puppet (or so she would have us believe). With 'Stripped' X-Tina clearly places herself beyond the other peroxide blonde pop-robots in the industry (and yes, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore et all I do mean you). Britney may \\"not be a girl, not yet a woman' but Christina Aguilera has no such doubts, this is one chick who certainly knows who she is, and then some.<BR> <BR>At 20 tracks long the record is hard work, but surprisingly there are no weak tracks. Not afraid to embrace diverse musical styles from the hip-hop of the Red Man featuring Dirrty, to the samba beats of Make Over, Stripped clearly is a record that is not just meant for the pre-pubescent market. Tackling various issues from sexism in the music industry to the public humiliation she has received from the likes of a certain Marshall Mathers III, Stripped remains dignified by never becoming pretensious, and knowing at its heart its just a pop  record. Unlike her debut album, Stripped is largely devoid of the vocal gymnastics (ie singing 12 notes when one will do), with ballads suchs as Loving Me 4 Me signalling a new found vocal maturity. <br />Highlights of the album include the Alicia Keys collabo Impossible and the sheer funk of opener Can't Hold Us Down. Featuring guest artists from Lil'Kim to Dave Navarro and the aforementioned Red-Man, make no mistake, this album is all Aguilera, with her taking many co-writing and production credits. <br />Stripped is simply a great pop record thats not afraid to shake off the innocent girl image that dogs so many of Aguilera's peers. Though not revolutionary in anyway, and slightly predicatble (why does artistic maturity always equate with wearing less clothes in your videos anyway?), this is a polished effort packed with hits, and in short the sort of album that Mariah Carey can now only dream off.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine's debut. It is considered as nu-metal, the album that created nu-metal, rap/metal. <BR>Probably the best album of all time.<BR>Every song has got its own identity, Morello's guitar parts are awesome, also the bass and the drums have a very important part in the band. Then there's Zack De La Rocha, doing hiphop lyrics which fit perfectly. A the beginning the vocals might sound distrubing, but once read the lyrics (which are genius!) and listened to it a couple of times, it's plain...it's the best thing there is. <BR>Opening Track Bombtrack gives a good feel about the album, followed by Killing in the name of, which' lyrics are emotional and very political. Followed by Take The Power Back, Settke For Nothing and Bullet in the Head, which are all masterpieces! And Again....THE LYRICS AND THE GUITARS! <BR>Then, maybe one of the best songs ever made &quot;Know You Enemy&quot;, it has the best lyrics, the best guitars of the entire album. There's also a guest apperance by Tool's Maynard James Keenen. <BR>&quot;Wake Up&quot; starts up with some great guitars and it followed by the two great tracks Fistful of Steel and Township Rebellion, After we get the closing track, the most emotional song on the album called Freedom....amazing! <br />This album, if you give it a little time and get used to it, will blow you away and stay in our hifi for a very very long time!<br />Buy this now, it's a musthave for....everyone!
0446310786|5.0|Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is an honest and ethical man.  These characteristics he encourages on his children.  When he represents a young black man accused of rapping a white woman, the family is the aim of prejudices, racism, and criticism.  Growing up in Alabama during the 1930's, Scout and Jem Finch are aware of segregation, but do not fully understand it.  The children themselves are guilty of prejudice towards the town freak.  Because \\"Boo\\" Radley has not been seen in years, the two are in awe over his mystery.  To Kill a Mockingbird is told through the eyes of young Scout.  Acting very mature in conversation, Scout does not let on that she is only eight years old.  In reality, Scout does not understand what the accused rapist, Tom Robinson, has done.  Throughout the story, she comes to realize that the belief that he is guilty is not because evidence suggests so, but because he is black.  Harper Lee has created a true classic and a true masterpiece.  This is a book that I recommend everyone read at least once in their lifetime.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless novel that will stir all emotions.
B000000OUW|5.0|Best Albums from one of the best bands ever. <BR>Return to the Warlord starts up the album with a great masterpiece. Brothers of Metal forever made the Manowar fans into Brothers of Metal, it is an awesome track which has got the audience singing parts of the chorus. The Gods Made Heavy Metal is once again a song looking at metal, it is a great Manowar style song, the chorus is just pure awesome. Courage is a beutiful song, it is a real amazing song. <BR>The Power is a Manowar classic with a greta echo sound to the singing.<br />Manowar carries on the great style of the 80s and keep up TRUE METAL.
B00003CXCW|5.0|They sure don't make actors or movies like this anymore.  Sure this is probably the most campiest movie that has ever been transferred to DVD but you know something,,,,it's worth every penny.The DVD transfer is wonderful for both picture and sound. Watching this on DVD sort-of has a hipnotic effect on you,,,,,it keeps you wanting more and more and the time just flys by.  I wouldn't say this is a great motion picture but very much an important film of Americana and something we should all be proud of.  After all Gloria Swanson was a queen back then and this was the film that has had endless renditions to from musical stage to comedy routines on tv.  Well worth having in your collection.
B000002INJ|5.0|Manowar proofs once again that they're the kings of metal. This album is simply amazing.<br />The first song is like in so many other Manowar albums, a shout, a shout to make the people aware of the return of Manowar. King of Metal is a great song, having the audience shouting parts of the chorus it makes for a great song to be played live. <BR>Heart of Steel is a masterpiece, greta singing by Adams!<BR>After that we get a great guitar solo, and then the very artistic Crown and The Rind. After that the hymn Kingdom Come which is very moody. Track seven features a bonus track called Pleasure Slave which has some great guitars. <BR>And the comes Hail and Kill, a classic, probably one of the best songs of all time. After follows The Warriors Prayer, a non-instrumental track where we hear an old man telling a story about the four metal kings. Vlood of the Kings is the awesome closing track of the album. It's full of power and emotion. <br />Manowar, everything fits together.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Being a Nirvana fan since Bleach, this CD was a very long awaited treat. It was worth every minute!! The remastering is awesome, and the song selection is great! There are a couple songs I would've liked to see included, but oh well, I have all the other CD's, lol. If you're a Nirvana fan at ALL, you MUST buy this CD. Can't wait for the box set next year and the b-sides and rarities in 2005!! Love ya Kurt, Kris, and Dave!!
B00004Z459|1.0|As Pop is dying, it looks like the world need a band to replace the Backstreet Boys. <BR>Rap/Metal, the new thing. The stuff the kids like...so let's make a rap/metal album. It's a simple verse chorus verse, a part in order to make the song less boring, verse, verse, verse. It's not like these guys would have done much for their success, it's music made for the kids out there who are unable to listen to anything that's even a little more comlicated. <BR>MTV's new favorites, Linkin Park. <BR>Yes, no swear word, ain't that great? Now the moms are satisfied too!<br />Linkin' park provides music for people who music don't have lots of time to focus on it. It's mainstream music for the masses. So highly recommended for people who prefer house and pop music.
B00006CXXU|5.0|The Sophomore follow-up to her debut album really shows fans that Christina is to be taken serious. The heartbreaking ballad \\"I'm OK\\" is about her abusive father. Other highlights on this album would be Can't Hold Us Down, a female empowerment song produced byt Scott Storch, and the Alicia Keys produced song, Impossible. The next single \\"Beautiful\\" was produced by Linda Perry and is well, beautiful. I give this CD 5 stars because it is really just worth it. (...)
B00005K9LK|5.0|It all lead to this! Judas Priest's best work! Screaming for Vengeance is one of the best metal albums ever made. <BR>The Hellion starts up the album with some great guitars and the follow up Electric Eye is a awesome song. <BR>The album does not include any weak tracks, every song has its own special identity, looking at the guitars and at the style of singing. <BR>Screaming for Vengeance is a extremely good song, focusing on the frontman's (Halford's) voice. You GOt Another Thing Coming, established Judas Priest as MTV icons back in the 80s, and Devil's Child is one of the greatest songs ever made. It contains a greta chorus and guitars. <br />Like 80s metal, you gotta have this album! This is true metal at its best.

0743420373|5.0|People must learn that rich isn't about money, it's about the thoughtform one learns and the ability to network with people and develop one's thoughts.  Money isn't the end all but I think that the development of the consciousness, the creativity of businesses is essential to the development of our culture, our world as a whole.  Don't misunderstand me, I don't think that a purely capitalistic strategy is perfection but I do think that the availibility of it will allow minds to develop, to formulate new concepts.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD WITH ALL MY SOUL! <BR>Generally speaking, i don't understand, how some of you, dare to trash on something, a person, investead all his heart & soul into?! <BR>I see Pink as a gifted young artist,blessed with potentcial & ability: With her expressive,powerful honest voice, she gives her creation 'life'; The lyrics, layout some of her life senerios, as well as her prespectives & opinions on different issues; as she sings, you can 'feel' the story told.  <BR>This album had the power to make me feel i wasn't alone, in the emotional mess i was going through - and to have the ability to effect the lives of others through her music, proof that<BR>Pink should have the *most* amount of credit & respect!<BR>- NOT the opisset!
B00006CXXU|5.0|'Dirrty' (and the video) do not represent this album well, or at all. This is a very good, mature album for an older crowd...I don't expect teeny boppers to love it. Christina showcases her voice incredibly good without over doing it. Her songs touch various subjects, and the music is very well composed. Everything's right on point. Some are better than others, but in all seriousness, they all are good songs. Although its hard for some people to believe it, this is an incredibly good album. Christina has tremendously matured and it shows through.<br />If you're a music lover, give this album a chance, it won't dissapoint you.

B00005N83M|1.0|Jennifer Lopez is a very actress actress who is making a steady climb to the top of her professions; as an ACTRESS! I like Jennifer. Its great seeing a woman of color actually suceeding in a industry, such as the entertainment industry, that will honor practically anything blonde and thin. But she just cannot sing. This seems to be a fact that few people notice. In every interview they usually talk about whomever she happens to be dating or what she's wearing. I'm scared that all of this talk may actually have her believing that shes good. Say it ain't so Jennifer!
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Okay, so this may not be a patch on the original movie and a may have a weak plot that would struggle to fill a half hour TV show but it's also nowhere near as bad as most people have made it out to be and still has it's high points and amusing moments.<br />Five years after the original hit movie Men in Black took movie theatres across the world by storm, the world eagerly awaited Barry Sonnenfield's follow up which reunited the hit pairing of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. What the world expected was another hour and a halves worth of comedy and kickin'...action. What we get is a plot that, much like the original, has an alien villain, Serleena  (Lara Flynn Boyle) endangering Earth's population and the future of our planet, in her quest for the Light of Zartha. As it so happens, the only person who knows where the light is hidden is Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) but he's now working in a Maine post office and completely unaware of his MIB past, having been neuralized at the end of the first movie, leaving Agent J (Will Smith) to set about retrieving both K and his memory before it's too late. Cue a glorious laugh riot and lots of fun action. Well, you would hope so but....<br />One of the problems with sequels is that they invariably have so much weight of expectation but with the very odd exception (Godfather II, Empire Strikes Back etc.), they nearly always fail to be a match for the original and in some cases, such as Escape From LA, Highlander 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, they can be just plain awful. Many sequels just try to copy the successful formula of the original, missing out all the talent, originality, wit and imagination that went into making the original movie such a hit in the first place. Unfortunately to a great extent is the case with MIB 2, with many of the scenes and much of the plot being too similar to the original movie.<br />MIB II is in the end all action and FX but it is also generally uninspired and less entertaining than the original. I also think it missed Linda Fiorentino's presence but having said that, it does have its moments and it does have some good laughs: The high point of the movie is perhaps seeing Agent K as a militant postmaster complete with comedy shorts and long socks, as opposed to the cool black suit and shades of he usually wears and some of the scenes with Frank (the dog) are also amusing. However, that's about as good as it gets and seldom does it rise above average. Don't get me wrong though, this is not a bad movie, I did find it entertaining and it's hardly going to damage anybody's career. Most kids will love this regardless of its faults BUT although entertained my overwhelming memory of this movie is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.inal.

B00006CXXU|5.0|One fact that can't be denied by anyone about Christina Aguilera is that she is one of the most talented people in the music industry. Her vocal ability, while it may have been a little too in-your-face on previous albums, shines beautifully here. As a true Christina fan, who has been desperately awaiting this albums arrival; it's amazing to see how much she has grown. She has seemingly gone from an artist unsure of how to maintain popularity and sing what suits her to a powerful image of what true artists can strive to be. This album is composed of soul and emotions that cannot be found on her first \\"Genie\\" release. Thank you Christina, for taking a risk and being willing to sacrifice a bit of yourself even when you knew that you would receive criticism from some. She was born with a gift, and that, no one can take from her. Thanks for allowing us a glimpse of where your journey has taken you.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow! Christina has created an amazing CD. After being silent for quite a while she has returned with a bang, smash, boom, kablaam! Anyone who has heard her first single Dirrty has heard the great beat, and who doesn't want to dance to that song? But Christina's CD isn't all dancing and getting a little \\"unruly\\", she has those sad times. Such as in the song \\"I'm OK\\" which is about her childhood.<BR> The one thing about this CD that I absolutely loves is the variety she has \\"mean\\" songs like \\"Fighter\\" to the fun collaberation with Lil' Kim \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" which is a little ladies anthem. She collaberates with people like Red man, Lil' Kim, and Alicia Keys.<BR> This CD starts off great and ends amazing. It's the greatest [money]I've spent in a long time and it has songs that will be remembered for quite a while. Christina is back and she's hear to stay!
B000002R6A|1.0|Eric Burdon and the New Animals stumbled into the latter half of 1968 dogged by internal ruptures, fading sales and way too much studio time on their hands. So what does Burdon do? He decides to record a double album dominated by hoary psychedelic covers with an under-rehearsed band. I loaned this to a friend of mine to see how far he could get through it. He raised the white flag somewhere during &quot;Colored Rain.&quot; The band's clumsiness forces Burdon to do what he does worst, and that is fill gaps with hysterically longwinded vocal improvisations. Exhibit A: &quot;River Deep Mountain High.&quot; Instead of sticking with the listenable 3:52 45 version, LOVE IS expands the cut to well over 7:00 so we can listen to Eric pant riotously over Tina Turner. And that's one of the shorter tracks. Zoot Money contributes the sublimely ridiculous &quot;Gemini (The Madman),&quot; a 19-minute remake of a Dantalian's Chariot curio complete with spoken word section. It's guaranteed to clear the house of unwanted visitors or your money back. It's so awful it transcends unlistenable, it transcends camp, it transcends stupidity to arrive in an eden of delirium that's not all that different from the territory Arthur Lee charted, except Love marched triumphantly through the front door whereas these guys stumbled in from the rear end. BTW, Andy Summers was a New Animal at this point, but anyone seeking examples of the idiosyncratic guitar work he brought to the Police will hear here what he learned not to do musically. After striking out on cut after cut, Burdon finally manages a double with a good, soulful cover of the Bee Gees' &quot;To Love Somebody&quot; that acts as reminder of what a great vocalist he is when he's not singing hungover hippie gunk or ruining good songs with listless, hammy arrangements. I suspect the only reason Burdon got away with releasing this was because he was one of the few legitmate rock stars on MGM's talent roster at that time (You were thinking perhaps, the Osmonds?). Fortunately, our faith in Eric was restored when he rebounded from this fiasco to work with War. But if you must know why the Animals finally crumbled, buy this CD. Listen to the whole thing if you dare. Then, dare your friends! Hold wagers on how long one can hold out before demanding asprin. (No offense Eric, but this album is rotten.) To be fair, a truly pure spirit could treasure this record the way a real searcher may overcome innate artistic prejudice and common sense to find something true and meaningful in the music of Michael Bolton. Of course, that searcher isn't me.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's new album, \\"Stripped\\" is the best CD yet to be put out by this tiny vocal powerhouse.  I have nothing more to say than the fact that this is one of the finest recordings I have heard to be categorized as 'today's' music.  She infuses almost every style of music out there, and executes rhythms and vocals with expertise and poise.  She has come a long way since 'Genie In A Bottle.'  I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for a fresh, new sound from an 'old' favorite.

B00006V9A0|5.0|Simply put, this CD represents a complete collection and sample of Nirvana's recording.  With the exception of \\"You Know You're Right\\", the disc follows Nirvana from pre-Dave Grohl to the MTV Unplugged performance.  With the addition of \\"You Know You're Right\\", the listener can simply enjoy Nirvana.
0316666343|3.0|As you probably know by now, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold begins with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon in a town in Pennsylvania, and the rest of the novel is told from her point of view as she observes the aftermath from her omniscient vantage point in heaven.  That she can narrate the inner thoughts of different characters as they deal with the shock of her death is the best part of the book.  I've never had to deal with such a shocking loss in my life but the reactions of the other characters ring true to me and are sometimes very moving.  In addition, Ms. Sebold's portrayal of Susie's experience in heaven is interesting and, um, plausible (not sure how else to describe it, but it is an appealing vision).<br />Susie also delves into side stories like the sacrifices her once-ambitious mother makes for her family, and the troubled childhood of the man who murdered her, and continues to follow her family and friends for years after her death.  This isn't bad in itself but the sentimentality of the later chapters failed to warm my cynical heart, after I was taken in by the first half of the book and the stunned reaction of the town after the murder.  The captivating intensity fades and the book falters, in my opinion.  The prose has a few nice flourishes but is mostly straightforward; the characters' development slows to a halt and left me feeling they weren't fleshed out enough.  If either of these aspects had been meatier I think the book would have had more staying power with me.<br />Nevertheless, there are still enough chilling and memorable moments in the \\"The Lovely Bones\\" to make it a worthwhile read.  It's a nice first novel and my uninformed opinion is that Ms. Sebold's got the talent to produce even more moving and perceptive novels in the future.

B00000JZIK|2.0|This film is overrated. Very, very overrated. I guessed the &quot;trick ending&quot; almost as the movie started. The whole damned film hinges on this &quot;trick ending&quot;. Bad acting, bad plot, almost incomprehensible dialogue, and a lack of buildup to the twist at the end. We are given clues, but the end has no dramatic &quot;rightness&quot;. It's just an ending, with no brilliance to it.
B00003CXAY|3.0|Actually, the film was indeed released as 1.85:1 threatrically. I saw it on its original run in the theater \\"way back when\\" and later, ran it myself as a projectionist for the Nuart in LA. That print, too, was a 1.85:1 print (complete with printed masking). So, the DVD release is not a cropped version. He may be confusing Koyaanisqatsi with an IMAX film, Chronos, directed by Ron Fricke who was DP on Koyaanisqatsi - that film was 4:3 - the IMAX aspect ratio.<br />However, I cannot, as of yet, rate the quality of the DVD because I have not yet seen it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|i am the  first to review this album.  It's good so buy it now.  I hope you find this review extremely useful.  I'm not witty and intellectual like the other reviewers. But i have more heart.
B00006HBUC|1.0|Phewwwww-the only reason I actually saw this piece of ... is due to the fact that I was babysitting my little niece & nephew & they brought this along to watch.  I grew up watching the Scooby Doo cartoon-which is still topnotch in comparison with this awful film.  The fact that it is poorly written, directed & acted in is really no surprise-because it is common knowledge that any film featuring Freddie Prinze is a dud-the kid cannot act his way out of a paper bag.  Save your money, folks.  Anyone with half a brain would recognize this for the trash that it is.
B0000039PW|5.0|No one can do it quite like biggie. All his albums are amazing, but this one really stands out.  Juicy is arguably the best song in the history of hip hop. But, thats not all. Every song on this album is a classic.  The only cd that comes close to this one is Nas's Illmatic. but, BIG still takes the crown.
B000002G6J|5.0|JUST IMAGINE HAVING TWO CD'S OF EVERY COMPACT DISC ON A MUSICIAN WHO NO LONGER RESIDES PHYSICALLY WITH US (BUT IS HERE SPIRITUALLY).  THIS CD AS WELL AS EVERY ANTONIO CARLOS JOBIM AND JOBIM'S ACCOMPANIMENTS ARE MY MOST VALUABLE TREASURE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!  MR. JOBIM IS A GENIUS AT COMPOSING MUSIC, PLAYING THE (ACCOUSTICS OF) PIANO AND GUITAR.  HE WAS NOT THE GREATEST CROONER BUT WHEN I HEAR THE PASSIONATE VOCALS OVER THE LYRICS IN HIS COMPOSITIONS, I AM IMMEDIATELY REMOVED AND PLACED INSTANTLY IN THE HEART OF RIO, BRAZIL.  I SEE MR.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a great new album. Her first single choice was a very bad one...it does not represent what's on the album. It has great songs and I think she has proven she can write her own stuff. Her rumored next single, \\"Beautiful\\" (written by Linda Perry), is a great song with a positive message. I recommend this CD to all Christina fans - even if you hate her first single Dirrty, like I do. It's a new Christina...and although I hate her new look/image, she IS talented and she did a great job on this album. I love it. She's unique (she's not copying Britney Spears; they're both great artists though) and this album shows her maturity.  My favorite songs: Stripped interludes, Beautiful, I'm Ok...The rest are great as well.  Go pick it up!
B000002UDB|5.0|After \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" The Beatles were musically unstoppable. While \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was clearly a great album, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is no less great but got caught between \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"The White Album\\", both of which are considered groundbreaking. I suppose that eventually you run out of superlatives in describing three outstanding albums in a row from one group. However, it is this quality that made The Beatles the greatest rock group of all time.<br />The album kicks off with \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", which is as innovative and musically interesting as the song \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". In addition to being novel, this song was featured in an extended music video that featured the songs from the first half of the album. One of the interesting features of this album was the number of songs that had little or nothing to do with love and girls, delving instead into subjects tending toward the psychedelic, such as this song does.<br />\\"The Fool on the Hill\\" is a song that shows that even though The Beatles music was generally becoming more complex, they could create relatively simple masterpieces. This song is John Lennon and Paul McCartney at their creative best.<br />\\"Flying\\", attributed to all four, is an unusual instrumental that again has a bit of psychedelic feel to it. A good fit with the tv show.<br />\\"Blue Jay Way\\" is a perfect fit with 60s psychedelic music. The music was simple, but the bizarre sound of some other psychedelic music. Note that this song led many of the other groups that tried to create similar music in 1968 and 1969. This song is a good indicator of the direction that George Harrison was heading in his life and his music.<br />\\"Your Mother Should Know\\" is relatively simple compared to the songs surrounding it. More like pop, but in this context it provides the reference for how psychedelic the other songs really were.<br />\\"I Am the Walrus\\" is one of the all-time great psychedelic songs that set the stage for much progressive rock that followed. The song has lyrics that almost make sense, and do if you try not to decipher it word for word. It was music like this that was the basis for Yes in the creation of \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\". Sounds carrying meaning independent of the actual usage of the words.<br />From this point forward the songs were added to complete an albums worth of material. And what great songs these were. Generally pop songs, but with Beatle's class, every one a classic and great. Two things worthy of additional note: First, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is a very well done pop ballad that is classic Beatles, and another of the songs that show how perfect John Lennon and Paul McCartney were as a team. The other is that \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was the first world-wide satellite broadcast of a show, and an indication of the popularity and success of The Beatles.<br />Perhaps overlooked by some, but one of The Beatles' greats, this album is a combination of a concept (the first half), and a collection of singles. Quality in every song, this one is a must-have for any Beatles or 60s music fan.stage for much progressive rock that followed.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Tempting though it may be to use my allotted 1,000 words to thoroughly trash this perverse, voyeuristic cinematic drivel, I shall instead be brief. This seems to be one of those artistic creations that people tend to either love or hate. Count me firmly in the latter category. In several decades of avid movie viewing, rarely have I so regretted wasting my time and money on a film. I'll admit that the first half of \\"Mulholland Drive\\" seduced me into thinking, hoping, desiring a big payoff in the second half. But it was just a tease. The second half marks as rapid a descent into nihilistic depravity and madness as I've ever witnessed (and hope never to witness again). However, I can't claim I wasn't warned - after all, it was no secret that this was a David Lynch creation. Given the apparently uniformly raving critical response to this film, I felt compelled to make it known that not everyone concurs. I consider myself fairly intelligent and open-minded, but I just can't help assessing \\"Mulholland Drive\\" as a pot-holed dead end.
B00000273M|4.0|Now for something different:  The Bangles.  The Bangles were sort of late new wave, which means that they were quickly identified as pop.  Make no mistakes, they are pop.  And what great pop it is:  \\"Eternal Flame\\", which comes with a great music video, \\"Manic Monday\\", \\"Walk Like an Egyptian\\".  Some of their pop is throw-away tunes, but songs like the aforementioned were very good pop indeed.  My favorite Bangles song will always be \\"Eternal Flame\\", which is one of those absolutely incredible songs that will stand out as a great ballad and will be collected on dozens of love CDs, best of the 80s, and on and on.<br />This CD collects the hits they had plus some of their other memorable tunes.  In addition to the aforementioned songs, I also like their cover of \\"Hazy Shade of Winter\\", \\"If She Knew What She Wants\\", \\"Be with You\\", and a blues ballad, \\"Following\\".<br />The music throughout this CD is well-played.  All of the music is very easy to listen to and generally pretty good.  These four ladies really know how to play their instruments.  Though they were an 80s group, there music still sounds fresh, which is somewhat different from a lot of other 80s groups whose music sounds dated.<br />This CD collects the majority of The Bangles best, and once you have this CD you have the essential Bangles.  I would move on to The Bangles released CDs only if you just have to have more of what of the same.
B00006LWSF|3.0|OK.  Eminem is amazing, his lyrics are out of this world....but I'm not sure how I felt about all the other songs...they are ok...I bought the CD to support eminem... but eh, its just ok.y
B00005ASHM|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I have ever listened to. I never liked the beach boys and I thought that they were a silly band that made stupid music. I myself am a fan of groups like the velvet underground, pink floyd or the doors (I consider \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\", \\"White Light/ White Heat\\", \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" or \\"The Doors\\" to be other masterpieces), but I have to agree with most of the reviewers that this is a true masterpiece. All of the songs are beautiful and they are sang by a great vocal group. It takes a while to start liking Pet Sounds but that usually happens with great albums.
0767802624|5.0|MIB is the most awesome movie with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The special effects are great and the gadgits in the film are incredible. One of the coolest parts in the whole film is when Will said. ''Drop whatever GALEXY you  have and walk away from yo busted-ass ship and put your hands behind your head.'' and the Bug replies. ''...And put my hands....On...My head?'' And he rippes the flesh right off. If you are to squemmish for a little grossness and humor don't buy this. But if you arn't a chicken buy this today. I MEAN RIGHT NOW!!!!
B0000013G9|4.0|I love CrazySexyCool. It has a great overall vibe that is easy to get into. I would've given this album 5 stars, but there are a few songs that are a little in poor taste. I would suggest this album for anyone who is looking for an over all mood setting cd. When I put this cd on it creates the perfect atmosphere for romance. With the low soulful voice of T-Boz and the good to life lyrics it a combo that is hard to match. You can put it on and let it run because all the songs work.
B000002GHH|5.0|This record is superb from start to finish. The songs are impeccably crafted yet emotive, sometimes gut-wrenching. <br />The whole album has a stripped down feel and sound - not surprising as it was recorded in just 4 days - and it's all the better for it. With limited possibilities for overdubs and multi-tracking Hiatt and his all-star backing band of Ry Cooder, Nick Lowe and Jim Keltner produce telling  and memorable performances. <br />Cooder in particular is mighty and it's worth buying the disc just to hear him in this kind of form. The opening cut (Memphis In The Meantime) includes the line \\"I need a Telecaster through a Vibrolux turned up to 10\\" and Cooder takes that well to heart, often dancing on the edge of feedback and playing with an improvisational edge and astonishing tone that he has not reproduced on record since.<br />No point discussing stand out tracks here - they're all winners. The singing's great, the playing is magnificent, and the record packs a mighty emotional punch.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|This is a very good soundtrack.  By now I'm sure you must have heard LOSE YOURSELF by EMINEM considering they play it on commerical every 19 seconds.  I think that song is very strong, as are EMINEM's other tracks, the pounding 8 MILE, LOVE ME with OBIE TRICE AND 50 CENT and RABBIT RUN (which is the weakest of Em's tracks).  He also lends a rap to D12's RAP GAME which is another good track.<br />50 Cent really shines on his singles PLACES TO GO and WANKSTA.  They are two of the best songs on the album and really make me want to hear what this guy can do with a full album produced by Eminem or Dre.<br />The other good tracks are RAKIM with R.A.K.I.M.  Rakim should be back strong next year, and this is just a sample.  Jay-Z's song is nothing memorable, but a good solid track.  Xzibit contributes with Spit Shine, a song that is solid but not his best.<br />The most dissapointing thing is Nas's track, which has his usual good raps but doesn't click for some reason.  There are also two slow R&Bish type songs that are decent but I really don't care for.<br />The Bonus cd is a nice touch. 50-Cent's Freestyle is good and Obie Trice and Joe Beast (who?) contribute good songs.  Eminem's extra song STIMULATE is from THE EMINEM SHOW sessions but is nothing special and its easy to see why it did not make the album.<br />All in all its an excellent cd that rap fans will like a lot, and that Eminem fans will LOVE.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Similar to &quot;Mutations&quot; in style (slow and acoustic), but more meloncholy in tone and emotion.  Again, Beck impresses with mind expanding lyrics and surprising rhymes.  Excellent choice if you enjoyed Mutations, but a definate departure from the Beck of &quot;Odely&quot;.  5 Starrs
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros are a blend of sounds the like of which you will not find elsewhere. With a dedicated fan-base as diverse as Radiohead (who cited them as an influence on Kid A) and Cameron Crowe (who included three songs in his movie Vanilla Sky), this could be the album that finally earns them the widespread recognition that they deserve. Their second album Agaetis Byrjun was a monumental epic that created a new sound. This third album consists of studio versions of songs that have been honed over the last two years during live performances. Their previous albums have been in Icelandic; this latest one is in Hopelandic, a made-up quasi-gibberish that allows lead singer Jon thor Birgisson (Jonsi) to project his voice (half-way between choir-boy and Thom Yorke) almost as an instrument. Incidentally, the lack of lyrics allows each listener to conclude what each song means to him personally, and your interpretations can be posted on the web alongside other fans'. The tracks are also untitled, though many of them carry unofficial monikers. With any other band this would be an act of extreme pretence, but as a Sigur Ros fan it is hard to conclude that it could have been done any other way. Even the album itself is untitled, simply named ( ), which can be interpreted as symbolising the two distinct halves that complete the whole, or it could be on a similar theme to the interpretive lyrics, in that you should fill in your own album title. Track 1, sometimes referred to as Vaka, is the one they most commonly kick off their concerts with, and it is an appropriately slow track that utilised a calm piano riff. Track 2, Fyrsta, is again a beautifully-constructed track that is more mournful, almost lethargic. Track 3, Samskeyti, for lack of other words can be described as unbelievably pretty, and uplifting as it combines once again a simple piano riff with strings, in what is an instrumental piece. Track 4, Njsnavlin, is perhaps the most famous song off the new album: it was used in the climactic scene of Vanilla Sky, and was performed on Kilbourn. The first studio version combines all the best aspects of the various forms it has appeared on stage, and adds an accompaniment that at once achieves perfection. Track 4 is followed by a silenec that allows the mood of the album to totally shift. When it restarts with lafoss, it is much more downbeat in tone, but no less masterfully-constructed for it. The songs effortlessly segue into one another as E-Bow and The Death Song go by, as it gears towards the climactic Track 8: Popplagi. Unlike anything else they have ever composed, 'The Pop Song' rocks out with an intensity unlike anything else I have heard. The various elements just come together in perfect unison to achieve a perfect blend of emotion and intensity that leave you reeling as the CD comes to a close. Appropriately, Sigur Ros are in the habit of ending their sets with this track. The final lyrics of Agaetis Byrjun made reference to how this was a Good Beginning (the literal translation of the album title), but that they will do better this time. On this evidence, they keep getting better...
B00006V9A0|5.0|When I bought this CD my initial thought was to give it a mixed review based on the fact that it only has one new song and only 14 tracks total.  But...what a new song (!!) and the other 13 are all gems.  Sure, there was room for more songs (this collection clocks in around 50 minutes) and some rarities would have been nice, but judging this collection solely on what is here I have to say it's perfect from start to finish.  \\"You Know You're Right\\" is classic Nirvana and certainly sounds great along with other singles and hits.  The remastering is really only noticeable on \\"About a Girl\\", \\"Been A Son\\", and \\"Sliver\\".  I was also pleased that \\"All Apologies\\" is the MTV Unplugged version (which got more radio play) rather than the original studio track.  The only knock against this CD is that other than the new song there isn't much else for a die-hard Nirvana.  That said, I own no other Nirvana CD's and this one suits me fine.  If you worship at the altar of Nirvana then you're probably better off waiting for the box set, rarities, and so forth that are supposed to be coming.  For everyone else, this is an essential piece of rock and roll history.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-man is great. Great visual effects, just as speedy (or rather slow) as the matrix. It has it all-great characters, great plot, great special effects and of coarse great sound editing! It is almost exactly like the comics/TV cartoons! In all probability one of the only differences are that... I'll let you know after you watch it (don't want to spoil it). This movie is worth watching! It's worth the wait that all Spider man fans have been waiting for. It's a film that's appealing to children, teenagers, and adults! I haven't met anyone who hates it! It has both romance and humor! Dunst and Maguire are perfect for the role! It's a movie that let's you know how wide an imagination of a director can be. It's a touching story and at the same time a fast action movie that you wouldn't mind watching over and over again! In a way it's like the comic book coming alive! It's for all Lord of the rings-Harry Potter-The matrix- and Batman fans!<br />    It's fundamentally concentrates on Peter Parker-a guy who's in love with Mary Jane. It's a kind of movie that Alanis Morissette songs would really go with since she has songs to support all the moods that you'd feel as you watch Spider-Man (and hey she has a song called Mary Jane!). <br />   Overall it was really worth the wait. It's better than any movie I've watched all summer! The movie packs together a lot of excitement. Just like Lord of the rings it's touching and at the same time exciting (I know I've mentioned this before!). No one could have made it any better than Raimi (although I'd like to watch a movie directed by Peter Jackson and Raimi). Spider-man is no old super hero movie (although it does have a damsel who is constantly in distress)-it's a modernized fast creation that could only be imagined as you read the comic books-until now! It's an impressive flick that you should watch if you haven't watched it yet! It's a movie that very rarely bores you. It doesn't stretch a scene by giving you too much detail.
B00006V9A0|5.0|this album is without a dough a work of art some of there best work can be found on this CD along with the new song titled you know your right <br />if you like nirvana or know some one that dose this is a grate one to pick up or if you want to here some of what nirvana is about this is a wonderful way to look into there musical history<br />this album proves that rock is not dead & wooden it be cool if it started a rock come back like they did so long ago<br />so in closing if you want an album that gives you a bit of every thing & stays true to what you love this is the one for you pick it up
B00005U8EM|5.0|...is a praise I don't offer lightly. This movie isn't only unbelievably funny, but also very intelligent. I've seen it about 10 times and it seems to get better with each viewing. Great actors (Bill Murray: never better), even in the smallest roles, a fantastic script and a fine direction all contribute to a wonderful experience. The extras are a worthy addition to a fine DVD.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This has to be one of the most intense albums I have listened to in ages. The sadness that permeates the air when this album is being played is staggering! I thought Agaestis Byrjun was morose, but this, well it takes the cake. Like it's predecessor this latest release relies upon atmosphere to power it's songs, along with the falsetto vocals singing lyrics in a made-up language, however the main difference between the two is that this is less catchy, less pop-minded, if you could ever call the last ones pop-minded. It is near impossible to pick out one particular track from the other, instead this albums songs meld into one. Not to say all songs sound the same as that is not the case at all, but almost like a symphony with different movements. Each movement has it's own distinct feel yet all songs run along the same theme, the same flow of utter desolation. The result is a very solid and effective album and one that should not be ignored. A graceful yet powerful beast that creeps up inside you and fails to release it's grasp even after it's 70 minutes has completed it's revolution.
0440213525|5.0|This book was excellent, with its good plot and good climax.  The characters were very real. The story took place in Louisiana with a story about kids that witnessed a suicide and thought the mafia was after them. The characters were Mark, Ricky, Dian, Jerome and doctor green. Mark and Ricky were walking in the to have a cigarette. After about 5 mins. A black Lincoln pulls up and stops about 40 ft from were the boys are sitting and stopped. Mark and Ricky were about to run when Mark said let's stay here and see what's going to happen.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Buy this CD right now. Don't even think about it, just buy the CD. Trust me, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! This is definetly one of the BEST albums that I've ever listened to. It's an awesome mix of rock, r&b, pop, and soul. Christina Aguilera has the BEST voice in the music business right now. Usually an artist will come out with a new album, but all the songs will sound alike, which is definetly NOT the case with 'Stripped'. Each song has a different sound and style to it, which is very good. This deserves any 'album of the year' awards that are out there!
B000002NHN|5.0|I've had this cd for a few years, and it was the first of hers I'd gotten. The music is blissful, and a great intro to Loreena McKennitt. I recommend any of her work.
B000068TPN|5.0|Not since A Bridge Too Far, have I seen such an intersting and inside look, at the soldier's and Air Cav's, role in 1965. Well edited action sequences, fire fights, naplam drops as well as interpersonal relationships with loved ones. Gibson and Elliot know their craft and their power as actors-are not to be underestimated. The battles scenes are excellent-not short stunts-but long &amp; tiring dangerous confrontations-that leave the viewer on the edge of the seat. And they are not exaggerated. Pretty true to the original events, from Novemeber 1965. GET IT. Watch the film then check out the Director's excellent commentary. You feel like a part of the team. Techincally, very well done...with strong characters by Gibson, Elliot and all who contributed.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Wow.  I'm speechless after having given STRIPPED my inaugural listen.  Well I must say that Christina has very much come into her own, musically speaking.  I'm still reeling from \\"Keep on Singing my Song,\\" the final track.  In the key of E, this semi-breezy, and very soulful song is just a testament of what Ms. Aguilera can do when given the leeway by RCA bigwigs.  It is amazing.  The real stand out tracks are:<br />Loving me 4 me:  almost a mix between Mariah and Jill scott.<BR>Impossible:  Alicia Keys knows how to get Christina to take us all to church.<BR>Beautiful:  Absolutely amazing.  Reminiscent of something you might hear on a soundtrack for \\"The Wonder Years.\\"  There is a very open, liberating feel to the song.<BR>Cruz:  Beautiful<BR>Soar:  One of my favorites, has a gospel choir that lifts the song up into the stratosphere.<br />This CD is a must have for the fan of good female vocals.  (...)
0767802470|5.0|The title says it all. If you can watch this film without being moved by the suffering and horror that these young submariners had to endure (regardless of the twisted ideology that sent them to war) there's something badly wrong with you. Insightful, gritty, with believable, human characters (Jurgen Prochnow was born to the role of the captain, but the entire sub crew are immaculately cast) thoughtfully presented and beautifully shot, with a haunting score. This is not another preachy 'war is hell' (so what else is new?) kind of film. It's a great film, period, and in it's own sad way, very uplifting. The directors cut is outstanding, and I found the commentary rivetting. If you appreciated Das Boot, I'd recommend you check out 'Stalingrad', in the unlikely even that you haven't already. Admittedly, it's an almost unremittingly grim and brutal experience, so not for the faint hearted, but a fine film nontheless.
0892818875|5.0|I first read this book when it was recommended to me by a Massage Intructor,in Australia, who was an inspiration in herself. It is simple and informative , while insightfull, for both the beginner in Aromatherapy as well as the practitioner. I would recommend it to anyone who is open to wholistic healing, and to those who just aren't sure. Great to have in the house as a reference.<br />Mojay has simply explained the links between healing the spirit and the body using aromatherapy.
0316666343|2.0|What happened to this novel?  It started off wonderfully and grabbed me from the first chapter (read it here at Amazon and see if you don't agree) - I can see why the publisher wanted it in print.  But each chapter thereafter gets duller, more mundane, and - especially in the last 100 pages - downright inane.<br />I don't doubt Ms. Sebold's talent as a writer, but it seems obvious she had no idea how to end the book - and still doesn't.<br />One other note: you need to be able to handle metaphors that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Doesn't Little Brown have editors anymore?  I can only hope whoever writes the screenplay (I assume this is going to film) will rewrite the second half of the story.
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot's IOWA is a jaw breaking, mosh pittin', heavy metal musical massacre that is probably one of the best metal albums of that year. Unlike many other bands today, no re-hashed chords or melodies were used and this album proved that no matter what, you can count on Slipknot to be organic every single time instead of re-releasing a previous album and calling it new material like some of those other guys.<br />This one keeps you going. For me personally, it's very rare when a band makes a CD that I can listen to all the way through not skipping any songs. I did that on the self title SLIPKNOT and now again on IOWA. <br />Usually lightning doesn't strike the same place twice but I assure you that this one has. Get IOWA and if you're trying to catch up, make sure to pick up the self title SLIPKNOT as well.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina came into this world of music as a little angelic butterfly.  She was very cute, petite, and one heck of a powerful voice.  Now look at her, she's become a woman, and bursting at the seams, literally.  Before this album I considered Christina another \\"Britney Spears\\" - just trying to copy her MMC sister.  But she really stands out from Britney.  I'm okay, is very touching, and you almost want to cry along with her.  Dirrty, is just that, very dirty, but it makes you wanna get your groove on.  I think what made her catch my eye was seeing MTV's Christina Aguilera Stripped in NYC.  It made me see the real side of her.  She seems like a real sweetie.  And her performance with the PussyCat Dolls, makes me wish I had been there. That would have been quite a show.  I recommend this CD for listening in the car.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is the last album the Beatles ever recorded as a group.  <br />I think the interesting thing about this album is how on side one we have each of the Beatles doing more or less their own thing...<br />Lennon does his nonsense funk-hard rock (Come Together) his hypnotizing post-psychedelic harmony (Because) and the vastly underrated &quot;I Want You (She's so Heavy)&quot; which may have his simplest lyrics ever but he turns them into desperatly powerful statements with a couple great guitar and bass riffs and an amazing vocal performances that alters power and tenderness.<br />Harrison only pens two songs but he proves his worthiness by making them 2 of the albums 3 most famous tracks...the exquisite &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and the famous &quot;Something.&quot;  He would continue this success with his solo debut &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; which contains many songs he had written back in the Abbey Road era.<br />McCartney takes a back seat (relatively speaking) for side one, only throwing in the happy-go-lucky &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; which may well be one of his catchiest songs ever, the vocal-shredding a la Helter Skelter &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; and the quietly attractive &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money.&quot;  Certainly not the most famous of McCartney's Beatle tunes, but they are all good tracks.<br />Ringo is represented by his 2nd written song ever, &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;.  In typical Ringo fashion its catchy, pleasant, and simple.<br />...But on side two we have the Beatles seemingly back as a cohesive unit, with their ever-famous suite of song fragments, all of them good ones, and with each Beatle doing their part.  Ringo pens a rare drum solo or 2, Lennon being fun without losing his creativity in Sun King/Mean Mr Mustard/Polythene Pam, Paul proving hes no slouch either with the beautiful She Came in Through the Bathroom Window/Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight, and &quot;The End&quot; bringing the Beatles together in their glory.<br />Only George seems to have taken a back seat on this one, but in typical Beatles fashion; he only penned 2-3 songs on any Beatles album.  But he sure made the best of his chances!
B000058983|5.0|Denying the emotion in this album denies everything you have ever felt about music. Not only do the songs on Forever Changes display the turmoil and confusion of the time it was made, it can equally be brandished for the world today. Sure there's better albums out there, but this is one that stands seperate from the others through it's sheer creativity. This isn't the San Francisco psychedelic sound, this is pure L.A. manic music, the dark side of the hippie movement. It deserves a alot more recognition, nothing else sounds like this. I own all the &quot;classic&quot; albums and this remains to be a favorite of mine. As for calling it dated, I can't see why, the songs here linger for what seems like forever. &quot;You Set the Scene&quot; embodies what makes music worthwhile: complexity, emotion, and revelation. And please, the whole &quot;snot&quot; thing - it's a literary device called imagery. The album's called Forever Changes and that's excactly what it's about, change. If changes are too difficult for you, then go listen to something primitive and deny yourself a fantastic album.
0440539811|1.0|Save yourself the money. While I am a big fan of comedic nonsense like Catch-22, this book provided no entertainment value to me whatsoever.<br />I always finish what I read, but I had to put a gun to my own head to force myself through book 1, and I didn't consider for one second starting books two or three.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This CD has what Diana Krall does best and what I really want to hear her do:  get togther with a cookin' rhythmic combo and just swing through some jazz tunes.  She really finds a solid groove and sits right in the pocket during almost every tune.  Her piano playing gets better all the time: simple, with just the right combination of single note elegance and splendid jazz licks. Listen especially to her performances here of \\"Let's Fall in Love\\" and \\"East of the Sun.\\" She doesn't play a lot of notes, but she sure plays the right ones. They are right on the money. Jimmy Rowles and Hank Jones would be pleased. \\"Look of Love?\\" Well, OK, it was a different marketing shot, but my two cents ask that she put that aside now and get back to swinging and jazz, just like we get it here.  One quibble: she sings such great tunes with such classic melodies, it would nice to hear her actually sing them, rather than to play around with every one.  The great jazz singers always sang a few songs straight.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This movie spends way to much time developing why and how the main character (Guy Pearce) wants to create a time machine. Who cares! Move on into the reason we want to watch the movie, sci-fi action. By the time we get to the conflict there is no time left to have an exciting, plausible resolution. Unfortunately, I'm sorry I spent the time watching. I did like the main characters.
B00006C79E|2.0|With their previous album \\"Sound of Water,\\" St. Etienne seemed carving out a more sedate minimalist sound, but the effort was missing some melody and pop-hooks and it was a little difficult to join the notes together.  This album retreats from that progessive effort.  Finisterre recycles the sound of \\"Interludes\\" or \\"Good Humor.\\" More entertaining than the \\"Sound of Water\\" but quite vaccuous or innocuous.  \\"Action\\" and \\"Finisterre\\" are the only redeeming songs but can't are able to save the album like \\"Le Ballad de St. Etienne\\" did for the EP Interludes.  Everthing in the middle is quite forgettable, except that annoying bubbly pop song \\"Soft Like Me.\\"  \\"Amateur\\" is goes nowhere, I guess they were inspired by Hal Hartley's movie \\"Amateur.\\"  The slower more contemplative songs are too retro, distilled or disinfected to even relate to.  Like the songs themselves, the album lacks coherence and doesn't leave any sort of impression or statement.  My final criticism is that annoying narration done by some snobby sounding British dork reciting some random high vocabulary stupidities.  Finisterre is not an absolute loss, play it on [really] low volume and just keep it as background music while you do your everyday mundane tasks.
0930289455|5.0|This has got to be one of the single best Batman comics that I've ever read, and trust me, I've read them all. Being a huge Batman fan, I was worried about this, but after reading it, I decided to check out more of Alan Moore's work.(Also recommended, V for VENDETTA.) The story is fantastic, the art is freaking brilliant, everything is everything. This is a great read for hardcore fans or non-fans. Joker is at his most vicious and funny, and the story of how he came to be the way that he is today is great. No faults here.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It has indeed been a long time since hearing from one of the most gifted artist of our time..While I was not a huge fan of Genie in a Botle...it was a huge hit it came from a young girl who is now ready to shed her wings and blossom into a woman. Ring the ALARM this woman is truly on her way clearing away from the pop gum music Ms. Christina deserves much respect...The one thing she has that you can not take away is that voice it is amazing she really sets herself aside from all the bubble gum non singing acts we have today Anyway I suggest give this a try but BEWARE if you're looking for the young 17 year old girl this is not the one for you but since it is so good I would still give it a try...Much respect Christina I'm sure we will hear from you again...Don't let us wait so long...okay...
B00006V9A0|2.0|Kurt originally wanted to make light of the haphazard release of the Insecticide collection by mocking it with a title like \\"Cash Cow.\\"  Now, the cash cow has arrived.<br />This is an album of \\"essential\\" Nirvana songs to introduce new listeners to the power and beauty of Nirvana, while at the same time giving long time fans an opportunity to hear their favorite songs in a new context.  This is what Courtney has said.  And yes, the album has the seldom heard Sub Pop version of Been a Son and the Scott Litt remixed Pennyroyal Tea along with the long lost You Know You're Right.  Three \\"rare\\" songs out of 14 tracks.  This is nothing more than a collection of singles that have been worn out on radio before and after Kurt's untimely death.<br />The great songs and live staples of Nirvana's short, explosive career are missing from this collection.  The Insecticide standout Aneurysm, the hidden \\"No Alternative\\" track Sappy, Bleach classics Negative Creep and School, Kurt's favorite song from Nevermind Drain You.<br />This is the essential radio friendly version of Nirvana.  Their trademark energy and aggression is contained and mixed down in these tracks.  If you are a new Nirvana fan take the time to listen to Muddy Banks of the Wishkah if you want an overview of Nirvana and then explore the wealth of live and rare music that is available everywhere.<br />There is no doubt that this CD will sell like hotcakes.  People are dying for new Nirvana, but one rare song and 13 other songs that you can hear on the radio at any time is hardly an \\"essential\\" collection.  Let's keep our fingers crossed for the rarities CD (hoping that it is more than just b-sides) and the holy grail that is the box set
B00006JDVV|5.0|This is the Greatest Film EVER made! The acting spectacular, the cast superb, and the directing unbelievable. The special effects are amazing too. Why this did not win an oscar, I shall never know. Definately buy this film if you're into action and adventure. If you liked the Wedding Planner, don't buy it because Matthew's character is not a loving pediatrician. Enjoy.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a genuine musician, a genuine human being and a genuine talent. This album is so heartfelt and unpretentious and is a delight to hear and study. This music will enrich your musical knowledge and will open the door to the wonderful and playful mind of a great American. Get to know John Mayer and listen to the beginning of a genius in the making.
0920668364|5.0|We read this book every night before bedtime and sing the song to each other.  As a single parentof a boy I love that the story is geared toward mothers and son's without making any mention of anything other than their special relationship.  The ending actually makes me tear up on occasion, because the story is so touching and true to life.  Robert Munsch truly captures the mother-son relationship in a way I've yet to see elsewhere.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The movie that started it all. This movie is more than a classic, it defining moment in cinema. This adventure filled movie, is excellent and needs to be owned.
B000069AT7|3.0|First Universal pulled a fast one and included the original version of the film in the regular edition after suckering people into believing it was only available in this Boxed set.I didn't already have the included book, so I'm not feeling totally ripped off but it wasn't the reason I went for the extra bucks.Considering the price they could have at least designed a Box that actually closed. Or provided the velcro stickers I had to purchase to prevent the contents from falling out once the shrink wrap is removed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It has been ages since Miss Aguilera released her debut self-titled album but somehow she managed to keep her name HOT in the business with brilliant collabrations or tv appearances.Firstly I have never been Christina fan so I think I will review this album more objectively than others. My friend got the copy of her first album so I ha listened to it zillionth times which is not good lol. I decided to get her second album because of the fact that she collabrated with Linda Perry who is the massive masterpiece behind P!nk's album.I put the cd to my discman with a not that good feeling but I should admit that I am impressed by the whole process. Ok I can agree that her joy in her debut album is totally gone in this one but this is the best point of the album.Christina is more mature than ever , leaving her fellas Britney,Jessica and Mandy behind.It is certainly not a blonde-babe-chessy-pop album.It has nothing to compare with that,Highlights of this album are:<br />CAN'T HOLD US DOWN: 10/10 I dunno but Lil'Kim's appearance on this track makes it so special.The vocals and the belinding is awesome and definitely it is a great opening track...<BR>WALK AWAY:9.5/10: It is a 6 min. track and I can say that at the very first listening you have the possibility to hate it but after two or more time listening, I guess everyone will find a little bit part of their life in this song.Christina's vocals are impressive...<BR>FIGHTER:10/10 Definitely the best song in the album. Not only because Linda Perry's magic hands, Christina sounds like a deffo rock-chick that noone can except from 'Genie In A Bottle' girl.This song will capture you at the first listening and it should be the second single off the album.<BR>INFATUATION:9/10 Her latin roots comes again for this only latin-flavoured track off the album.The melody and sexay vocals makes it more worthy to listen..It will do well in Europe if it is released as a single.<BR>IMPOSSIBLE:9/10 To be honest I have to say that I don't likeAlicia Keys, therefore I skip this track in the first listening but then somehow I turn back to listen to it and God!It is awesome...Alicia plays the piano outstanding in this track and Christina's vocals are striking.It has this feeling of 80's track and it grows on you after two or three listening.<BR>MAKE OVER:10/10 Another hot pop-rock track with breathtaking vocals by Christina...The song is too catchy and I guess every Christina fan will be amazed by the whole song.<BR>CRUZ:10/10 Brilliant track.Great chorus and it will take you to an inner journey.<BR>DIRRTY 9,5/10:What can I say? This song is too dirty but in a good way.It is a good choice for the first single off the album but the album has more than that.Actually this album version has more rap part by Redman which can satisfy hardcore hiphop fans like ME lol.<BR>Ok although these are the highlights of the album, except 'Loving Me 4 Me' all the tracks are great and good combined in a way.No matter if you are Christina fan or anti-fan, go'n' get this album if you appreciate good music.I'm still not a Christina fan but I highly appreciate her music and her vocal ability.This album totally rocks...PS:Because of the fact she worked with great producers, you will see the chance in her lyrics wihch are strong,angry and sometimes lovely....
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is definitely apart of what the A&amp;E channel terms &quot;The New Classics&quot;. It epitomizes so the essentials of R&amp;B and Hip Hop that almost 5 years after its debut, I still have it in heavy rotation on my CD changer.<br />It makes you groove, it makes you think...it makes you grin, it makes you tear.<br />Lauryn set the foundation, a new stage for a different yet familiar sound. A re-birth, so to speak, of good things to come from our people...neo-soul, alternative.  However it's labeled, sometimes you need a catalyst.<br />The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.......Simply Essential.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Where Courtney could have given up some of her so cherished CREATIVE CONTROL, we are blessed/cursed with a disc of Nirvana's best, featuring a really creative album title (all of the disputes are cleared? yeah, right!) and a bunch of songs that the Nirvana completists and probably the passing fans already have. We could've been blessed with a disc of the hits and some rarities, we could've got some cool live stuff, but instead, Courtney (despite what the credits say, she most likely has final word) has given us, for the most part, the same old all over again.<br />Now, despite this rant, there are some good reasons to own this disc. The new song, \\"You Know You're Right\\", probably is the last great Nirvana song and it really is worth having. That said, while they're scant, there are a few rarities for the completists. The slower version of \\"Been A Son\\", originally from the Blew EP, makes an appearance as does the 'previously unreleased' Scott Litt remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" (it was never officially released but copies of the never-released import single featuring it were leaked and the track has circulated since). Personally, I prefer the album version but it's nice to have it since it's not an easy find.<br />So, in closing, 2 things: #1, this disc is really an okay starting point for new fans as it features ALL the singles/hits and a few must have tracks (I'm glad Rape Me and the original version of About A Girl made the list and You Know You're Right really is great!) but it doesn't serve enough depth for the longtime fans or anyone that really wants to know about the band. And, #2, why the hell did they put \\"Dumb\\" on instead of \\"Polly\\"? Who made that decision? This could've been a great oportunity to make a compilation that PROPERLY covered their entire career but instead we get a corporate greatest hits compilation! Courtney has shown she's the same as the corporate rock industry that Kurt always faught against, rehashing for the almighty dollar. I would've gladly paid for the proposed box set but instead I got just about everything I already had with only one thing I REALLY wanted. Beware.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Seriously, should this album be so catchy, to me it is, in a perfect world this would be pop, I hate to say it, even though this band definitly has the terrible placement of no category to be amongst, but what does it matter, this album is stand out, its one of those albums people who bought it will remember, especially if you catch on to what you're listening to, I hated the fact they broke up, it was right when I got into them, but oh well on to Sparta and Mars Volta, peace.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 seconds to mars, an amazing band has finally come out with their album, self titled. The song, &quot;Capricorn&quot; reaches out to the high point of the album. With songs such as &quot;capricorn&quot;, &quot;Edge of the earth&quot;, and &quot;oblivion&quot;, the listener can easily feel the energy eminating from the music into them. Many may not have heard of them, but i assure you, 30 seconds to mars is a powerful sound, and lyrics you just want to scream to. Enjoy 30 seconds to mars, anyone who cant appreciate the complete awesomeness of this music is missing out!
0671775308|5.0|A wonderful book that is full of examples, data and surprises.  It won't tell you how to get rich quick, it won't make you a better investor, but it might just shake you out of your financial rut.
0553573411|5.0|Royal Assassin caught my attention from the very beginning, and I couldn't put it down until I'd finished.<BR>There is just something about this book.  I can't quite figure out what it is though.<BR>It could be that the characters have flaws and virtues, that they act and think like real people.  You understand what motivates them, and you feel a certain empathy towards them, even the villians.  And that, I believe, is the true test of a book.  That the characters, even the bad guys, are seen as real people.<BR>Or, maybe it's the first-person perspective.  Robin Hobb has the unique gift of writing a story from Fitz's point of veiw, without letting us get so close that we can't see around him.  You live the story through him, but you never lose sight of the rest of the world around him.<BR>Or perhaps it's just that this story seems to touch something inside you.  You live this difficult time right along with the rest of the characters.<BR>This book takes Fitz and the rest so far from where they started that you might not recognize them by the end.  <BR>So, to sum up, read this book!  You will not regret it!

B00006DEF9|5.0|A Wonderful Blast of Color from everyone in it. Gene Kelly is marvelous a silent-film actor who, with the help of his friends (Donald O' Connor and Debbie Reynolds), makes his silent-film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a morden musical, The Dancing Cavalier. The only problam is his co-star, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). She can't act, sing, or dance, so they get Kathy Selden to dub her voice. But when Lina finds out, she;s furious and want's to &quot;Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue&quot;. The Crazy Events lead to a wonderful ending. Others in the cast are Cyd Charisse, Millard Mitchell, Rita Moreno, and Douglas Fowley. The soundtrack is wonderful too. It includes &quot;Good Mornin'&quot;, &quot;My Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Moses&quot;, &quot;The Broadway Ballet&quot;, and of course, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.
B0000028RR|3.0|They've got the hooks, it's a cohesive album, but it's pretty forgettable apart from one or two standout tracks that got played to death in clubs in the early-90s. I have higher hopes for Audioslave -- Zack de la Rocha was the weakest link.
0792844890|1.0|Putting this movie in your player can clear a room faster than a Fire Alarm. It was apparent when HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I was released that Mel Brooks had blown his comedic gift, but I doubt anyone expected the man behind the truly great YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN to bottom out as completely as he did here. Witless and torturously unfunny, with nearly every tired, corny gag ponderously telegraphed minutes in advance, (It's...the...Statue...of...Liberty...                                                                 \\"Planet...Of...the...Apes\\"...joke...coming...up...in...a...moment).There's really no way for me to convey how unremittingly awful SPACEBALLS is. When I saw it in the theater, I can recall only two genuine laughs in the entire picture: The never-endingly long spaceship that just keeps on passing by at the beginning, and the \\"One Froggy Evening\\" / Looney Tunes reference during the ALIEN parody. I believe I spent the rest of the time retching.You'd be better off watching your toenails grow than punishing yourself by sitting through this mess.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Anyone who is a Buffy fan must buy this Album.  It includes everything and more from the musical episode.  The sound quality is superb, much better than on television.  The album also includes bonus orchestral tracts form the episodes Hush, Restless, and The Gift.  For those of you not in the know, the muscial episode of Buffy was entirely written by the series creator Joss Whedon.  For someone with limited musical experience it is truly an astounding accomplishment.  The songs are well written, sly, funny, and sometimes heartbreaking.  Even if you're not a Buffy fan and just like musical theatre I think you will enjoy this CD.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|A very well done DVD for a Disney movie that's just not one of my favourites. Much appreciated, though.
0345349571|4.0|I read this splendid book although I already knew a lot about the first world war. This book covers the causes and the first 30 days of the &quot;great war&quot; on the western and eastern front, including battles like Tannenberg, the battle of the Marne..but for me as a Belgian above all the siege of Lige (I live less then 10 miles from Liege and visited several forts): A chain of already older fortresses around the Belgian city of Liege holding out in a heroic fight for a long time against the most powerful army of it's time : the Imperial German army! The Belgian fortresses were ultimately defeated by the legendary German supergun &quot;Big Bertha&quot;. Anyhow that heroic defense gave the English and French army the time to organize themselves and gave the tiny Belgian army the possibility to defend itself behind the river &quot;Ijzer&quot; until the end of the war. All this is written vividly in this extraordinary book.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This album is really great especially the tracks by Eminem and the one by Macy Gray, but the rest of the tracks are cool too!  I think that Eminem is a great musician and I hope his movie and acting skills are just as good as his song writing!  I urge you to buy this soundtrack if your an Eminem fan or like great rap, you will not be dissapointed with your purchase!!!
B000002H2H|5.0|I don't know where I can find a flaw on this album. The harpsichord intro to the downright heavy 'Fight Fire With Fire' works wonders. 'Ride the lightning' and 'Trapped Under Ice' are real headbangers. 'Fade to Black' is the best rock ballad ever written by Metallica, only rivalled by Ozzy's ballads. 'Escape' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' are the catchiest tracks on this album. 'Creeping Death' is storytelling Metallica at its best. And last but not least is 'Call of Ktulu', the best rock instrumental ever written by a rock band. Flawless ... absolutely flawless!
0385484518|5.0|Before I became a mom ~~ I was in the rat race wondering when the struggles would cease and I would find the joy in life again. It is amazing how when you become a new parent that you search for the meaning of life. And this book sums up what I have been learning the past year. It is not a book to speed read through ~~ you have to soak in the conversations between Mitch and his mentor, Morrie. And this is definitely one book I plan to keep for my sons to read when they are older.<br />Mitch writes easily of the conversations he shared with his professor and he writes movingly of life's simple lessons. We all tend to get so wrapped up in the \\"keeping up with the Jones'\\" lifestyle, that we forget what is really important in this life. And Mitch writes to remind us of the simpler pleasures as well. It is ok to cry. It is ok to be afraid of death. It is ok to envy ~~ just don't let all these things consume you that you miss out on life itself. We only live here once ~~ and the lesson here is ~~ don't miss out on it. Is it really important to have a new car? Or a new house? Or new clothes or whatever your heart desires? When you are on your deathbed, are you going to have a lot of regrets or are you going to celebrate your life as it was and move on? <br />Also, this book tackles the touchy subject of death ~~ something most people tend to avoid talking let alone think about. And Mitch did a wonderful job of conveying Morrie's thoughts on this subject as death slowly stalked him. It is a book written about a man slowly facing death ~~ and you feel like you're listening to an intimate conversation between two men ~~ and learn as well. <br />I highly recommend this book to others. This is a book for every serious thinker and reader in this world. It is something to discuss with others and perhaps maybe make one slow down and really look at life again. That is the major lesson I've gleamed from this little book!<br />10-28-02
B000002HRE|3.0|There are four highlights to this album:<br />1. Fuel<BR>2. The Memory Remains<BR>3. Unforgiven II<BR>4. Low Man's Lyric<br />The rest is nothing to write home about, some tracks one might even consider skipping when listening to this CD.
B00004R99J|5.0|Pocahontas has a beautiful love story and powerful message that kids can learn something from. The songs, and instrumental score are beautiful, and ranks as one of my favorite disney scores ever. My only complaint is that the picture quality of this dvd is not very good. I wish that it didn't look so grainy. However the sound is top notch.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|EMINEM IS THE MAN. HE SPIPS OUT 3 NEW SONGS JUST AFTER DROPPING HIS OWN CD. THEN TO ADD TO THOSE HE SPITS WITH D12 HIS BOY OBIE AND ANOTHER LYRICAL GENIUS 50 CENT. EMINEM DID IT RIGHT BY SAVING THESE SONGS FOR THIS SOUNDTRACK AND HAVING NAS AND JAY-Z ON IT AS WELL. I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE, GONNA BE OFF THE HOOK
B000003N7Q|4.0|This is the real deal. A classic jazz album featuring some of the greatest talents in jazz. The interplay between these greats is inspired, dynamic, and best of all, musical. Even though it's mostly on mellow and accessible side of jazz, Coltrane delivers plenty of intensity and even agressiveness (tracks like &quot;Take The Coltrane&quot;) to let you know this ain't no cocktail group. Best if listened to on vinyl.
6305313687|5.0|After all the bad reviews, I really did not expect to even watch the entire movie.  Yet I found myself gripped to the screen throughout.  This is riveting!  The acting is superb--particular acolades should go to Edward Norton, who also performed so brilliantly in \\"Primal Fear\\".  Honorable mention should also go to Edward Furlong as Norton's impressionable, younger brother.  One is reminded that compassion, love, and above all, reaching out to others, even when those people may hate you, forms the cornerstone of eliminating racism and bigotry from our society<br />I also loved the cinematic use of black-and-white to re-play past events.  The cinematography was incredible, and one cannot watch this movie without feeling a strong emotional reaction.  Some may hate this movie because of its obvious liberal overtones, but that is part of the shear brilliance of this incredible work.  No matter who you are, you will NOT watch this movie without having a strong emotional reaction to it!
0452282152|5.0|This book was a such a delight to read and is one of the few that I highly recommend to friends.  I usually don't write these reviews in such a forum, but after seeing a negative interpretation of this work, I felt it my responsibility to a fellow author to stand for their work.  The book is entertaining and offers a glimpse into the existence of a brilliant and remarkable painter.  The author does a splendid job with character development while allowing the reader refreshing liberty to explain and/or relate to situational circumstance.  Most of us read to be entertained and are not concerned with having every minute detail explained in the fullest.  If that were solely the case, we would stay far away from the arena that is fiction.  As for the negative criticism, all will never be pleased, but this particular work does please the masses without the pompous flair that is so evident in supposed 'great' works of the day.  Spend a rainy afternoon with this 'Master of Light' and his lovable assistant, two people from a different class who share the same respectful class (hint for Mr. Negativity).
0440219078|4.0|The Giver is written by Lois Lowry and it is about a boys life. One of the characters in this book is Jonas. He has a sister named Lily, and a mom and a dad. He has a best friend named Asher and they do cool stuff together. He lives on a flat island. They are like big brother because they have to listen from a big speaker. They have to look the same and you don't pick your job, they give it to you. I think this book is very good, but it is wierd in a way.
B00005N83M|1.0|I am from Puerto Rico, just like J.Lo, and in terms of putting our island on the international map, she gets my blessing. But I have to agree with another reviewer that she really can't sing at all. Plus, this album, like the others, is just mostly machine generated sounds, therefore not music. It is obviously purposefully manufactured with the only intention of selling as many cds as possible. Guess what? Given the ignorant musical climate of recent years and with her formidable physical beauty, that is not too difficult. Its the image that sells. To me, J.Lo's greatest talent is dancing, and second to that, acting. She could be a great choreographer/dance coach, and also an actress. That would make you rich enough, wouldn't it? Oh, well, long live good looks and the too-much-money-is-never-enough-so-lets-get-as-filthy-rich-as-possible mentality.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry is science fiction. Jonas is the main character of the story. He is wierd, but everyone is wierd in the story. He and everyone else have to do a challenge once a year and get new stuff every challenge. They are cut off from the rest of the world. Airplanes cannot fly over this place when they do everyone is scared. This place is dark, no sun and surrounded by water. This book is okay, it does not have much details and this makes you want to know what happens.
B00003CWTI|1.0|Once again, Hollywood proclaims not the most intriguing movies as the best, but the movies whose directors hobnob and schmooze like nobody's business. ...BR>     Part of the director's problem may be his believing his own hype; then again, he may seriously have issues with original material. The rain of frogs at the films end (which, for Magnolia followers, is their Waterloo), which comes from the ten plagues which God inflicted on Egypt in the Moses years, is a questioning moment, a bit o magic in an insane world, tries to tie in the decadence of L.A. and selfishness of its people with the idea that coincedental interactions of people are really manifestations fo a higher plan; the director shows God. But the director fails to bring us to that conclusion in a satisfactory manner, leaving us with pathetic, arrogant fools to lead us (the acting of Hoffman and Moore) as well as \\"look at me\\" types (Cruise) who ruins his part as only Tom Cruise can (it had the potential to make the movie a bit interesting, but failed). But the director is nice to rich, powerful people, so, despite this schlock and romance novel show, I'm sure he will annoy us on Oscar night for many years to come.
0743216458|2.0|I picked up &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; for two reasons: first, I have been hearing for years what a great historian Stephen Ambrose was; second, I loved the HBO series and thought the book would provide deeper insights into the men of Easy Company and their WWII experience.  How surprised I was to discover just the opposite.  Ambrose may have been a great historian, but he was no writer.  Incidents that in the series were presented with drama and suspense were written of in a flat-footed, perfunctory manner.  What I came away with most after reading &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; was less respect for Ambrose and more for the producers and writers of the series, who so successfully fleshed out Ambrose's skeletal text.  I don't think I've ever said this before, but skip the book and rent the movie.
B000008GEF|5.0|George Harrison is, hands-down, the most underrated figure in the history of popular music, and the most deeply moving songwriter of the twentieth century.  If you are not convinced, this album, a true masterpiece by the highest of musically standards.  If you like &quot;catchy&quot; pop/rock tunes, chances are you will be pleased with &quot;Living In The Material World&quot;, but it is for those how can truly appreciate slower, heart-touching ballads that this album will simply blow away all others.  In the opinion of my high school music teacher and mentor, &quot;L.I.T.M.W.&quot; is, without question, the true pinnacle of popular music, and I know that this opinion is shared by other musical authorities with respect for serious, moving music.<BR>     Enough cannot be said about the albums equisite musical underpinning.  Nicky Hopkins and Gary Wright provide truly lovely piano work, and John Barham's glorious orchestral arrangements splendidly back Harrison's masterpieces of composition.  The total effect is awesome on songs such as &quot;The Light That Has Lighted The World&quot;, &quot;The Day The World Gets Round&quot;, &quot;That Is All&quot;, and even the upbeat #1 hit single &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)&quot;.  The dramatic hymn &quot;Who Can See It&quot; vividly swells and soars to great heights, and is probably my favorite track.  The same can be said of the lavishly arranged &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;, which was co-produced by Phil Spector.  &quot;Don't Let Me Wait Too Long&quot; is an infectious little pop gem that easily could have climbed to the top of the charts.  The album's title track is a good, solid, energy-packed rocker with hints of Indian mysticism.  One of the album's most popular tunes, &quot;Sue Me, Sue You Blues&quot;, written about the Beatles' breakup, is by far it's least spiritually-oriented.  It is an biting, emotionally driven rocker with a catchy melody and, like several of the album's tracks, excellent slide guitar playing by George.  <BR>     It has been complained of ad nauseum that George &quot;preaches&quot; too much on this album.  The fact is that the spiritual lyrics on songs like &quot;The Light That Has Lighted The World&quot; and the title track have far more to do with George's personal beliefs and inward journey than any kind of admonishment of the masses.  Furthermore, the music itself it was is really spiritual about this album, and such lyrics are merely a fitting compliment to its true &quot;message&quot;, which lies within the awesome beauty of the music.  As Harrison himself states in the disc's touching closer, appropriately entitled &quot;That Is All&quot;, &quot;silence often says much more than trying to say what's been said before&quot;.  So I'll let the music stand for itself...
B000001EYO|4.0|having read these other fine reviews by fellow fans of this excellent coen brothers film, i have to say i agree with many when i voice my disappointment at the exclusion of creedence's very dude-like \\"lookin' out my back door\\". though not so much of a problem for myself, being an owner of a copy of \\"cosmo's factory\\", i feel that many buyers may feel disheartened to learn of it's absence on the album. this however, is no reason at all not to go out there and buy the damn thing! from the trippy kenny rogers track to the soothing tones of dylan, and even the excellent gipsy king's take on the eagle's classic Hotel...<BR> this is a winning choice. chuck this on the hi fi and watch people's heads turn. if you've seen the film, then this album serves as great reminder of those hilarious and moving moments of bizarre adventure that the dude and his \\"jewish\\" 'nam veteran buddy walter embark upon....
B00006LWSF|5.0|Okay well i think that this album is awesome. Most of tha songs arent lik em tho, but its pretty tight cuz its lik real rap not tha stuff he usually does which is tyte!!
1573222038|5.0|Fingersmith tells a great big wonderful story, one which you can sink your teeth into and really enjoy.  It started off in almost the same mode as Slammerkin.  London city girl with checkered past travels to countryside to deceive people, but after that, the two stories diverge and this one is excellent.  The story of Maud and Sue, two young women trapped in a web of deceipt and lies, a web woven by both themselves and others is thoroughly engrossing, filled with doublecrosses and interesting plot twists.  This is a very well-done, well-told story that you can really lose yourself in.  Enjoy.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I don't know. I know the Christina was trying to break away from her bubblegum pop image, but I think she just placed herself back into Britney's shadow trying to be different and more adult with this cd. I found the first 10 tracks uninpsiring and boring actually. The songs don't seem to stand out till you get to the 11th. And even then, there are only 4-5 songs that sound great from the last few tracks remaining. Christina has talent, no doubt. Her voice is the reason why I prefer her to Britney, but the songs don't do her voice justice. I don't like Pink, but I'll admit that her compilation of varied song styles make a much better album purchase than Christina's Stripped.
B000002J0G|5.0|Low marks a new standard for Testament as they move forward with their sound bringing to it a heaviness and fury not heard before. It's not that Testament's other albums haven't been killer, they have, but in Low Chuck Billy really goes all out with the vocals and in some songs he employs the full death metal growl. He doesn't overuse the death-metal voice however, preferring to use it only for extra emphasis on some of the tracks.<BR>Lead guitarist Alex Skolnick is not present here, and though his signature sound is missed, Testament sounds none the worse for it, on the contrary, Skolnicks departure may have been the reason for this new heavier musical direction. As always, the band is not content to just play at hyper speed or simply downtune and distort their guitars beyond recognition of any musical structure as many other metal bands do. Testament has always delivered inventive songs and intelligent lyrics along with the bludgeoning riffs, and Low is no exception. A worthy addition to the Testament legacy.
B00004W50T|5.0|This album changed my life, changed the way i think about music, and opened my musical horizons.  From the first song, &quot;Tears of Rage&quot;, i was blown away by the passionate, tortured, and beautiful vocals of pianist Richard Manuel.  Some of the other highlights are the rocking &quot;Chest Fever&quot;, the emotionally powerful &quot;The Weight&quot;, and the crazy &quot;This Wheel's On Fire&quot;.<br />The musicianship on this album is incredible from all 5 members, with Garth Hudson on organ, Robbie Robertson on guitar, Rick Danko on bass, and Levon Helm on drums, including when they switch around instruments.  This album captures so many emotions and successfully merges so many American traditions in music.<br />In addition, the bonus tracks are great too.  It's cool to hear alternate versions of songs, as well as songs that weren't even on the album.  &quot;Orange Juice Blues&quot; is great, as well as &quot;Long Distance Operator&quot;.<br />This album has great liner notes which really provide insight into the workings of this (at the time) pretty mysterious band.  This album is well worth the cost, and the extra stuff you get makes the deal even sweeter.<br />This album might take a few listens before you really get into it, but it is well worth it, as this album is one of the greatest albums of the late 60s, and remains one of my favorites.
B000056N8X|1.0|Is it possible to give negative stars?  I felt violated after forcing myself to watch this movie.  I knew it wasn't going to be any good before I sat down, but man; it was much worse than I thought.  Afterwords, I had to pop in the first film just to remind myself that there was once something called Highlander, something that was good, something that had a bit of heart, that actually made me feel something and eventually take a pilgramage (probably not the best word) to the Scottish Highlands.  The clips of the first movie in this one just made it all the more empty and revolting.  What was the budget on this, one episode's worth.  Check out the second to last scene of the film.  Duncan standing in front of what appears to be a styrofoam gravestone with an obvious backdrop of the Highlands behind him.  YOU CAN SEE THE LINE WHERE THE FLOOR SET MEETS THE BACKDROP.  This doesn't exactly stir any notions of rugged romanticism about the highlands.  Not only have the makers lost all integrity, but, I actually have to question Christopher Lambert on this one. I wishfully thought that playing a character as original and special as Conner might mean something to an actor.  How could he agree to do this movie.  Face morphing at the end?  What the..?  OK, I've said enough.  If you are a fan of the real Highlander (that being the first film and not the series), maybe watch the third film, but in the name of all that is sacred, do not even acknowledge the existence of the 2nd film or this endgame, as I have unfortunately done to write this warning.. I mean review.<BR>&quot;Why does the sun come up. Or are stars just pinholes in the curtain of night?  Who knows, Highlander, who knows?
B00004X0Q0|5.0|At around 1997 i stopped listening to the radio.  I was sick and tired of all of the stuff that i heard that had no punch, had no creativity, and no soul.  I got heavily into jazz (i still am) and basically forgot about what was going on in rock and roll.  One day at a local record store, i listened to this record on the listening station after reading something about them and was utterly blown away.<br />I truly believe this album will be considered to be one of the greatest rock albums of this decade.  This album is almost in two parts, as the first four songs will rock your brains out with their intense attack.  I love all four of these songs for their ferocity and madness.  Then, the album goes a completely different direction with &quot;Invalid Litter Department&quot; and blows you away once again.  The rest of the album musically goes in many different directions, but throughout there is amazing musicianship and one of the the most charismatic and passionate vocalists we've had in a long time, Cedric Bixler.<br />Sadly, ATDI broke up soon after this album came out, and split into two groups.  So, if you want to hear an amazing and creative band at the height of their powers, do not hesitate to get this album.  It rocks like hell and it does a whole lot more.
0385484518|4.0|This was such a delightf bookt read because I was so moved by Morrie. I think everyone has one time or another had a teacher guide them as Morrie did. All the wise things Morrie had to say can apply o everyone. I think this can open your eyes to see how you live your life. This gave me a new perspecetive on life and what I need to improve.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I like how people that review this album with less than 3 stars think they are real fans of Beck, how dare you? This album is a work of art. What makes an artist truly great is their ability to change and grow. Go buy this album, you will not be disappointed! If you really get Beck, you will get this CD. The majority speaks volumes. I would have loved a few more peppy tunes in the mix, but the tone of the album would have been altered. I predict a little more up beat follow up to this in the future. Then someone can bash that too. You can't please everyone! After listening to this CD, I doubt Beck cares what anyone thinks.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I need to say something here.<br />Christina Aguilera is a genius. She takes the hard road for things and she always has. For anyone who knows anything about her life, you'll understand that the easy road hasn't even been accessible in her life.<br />By incorporating jazz and rap into her new album, Christina has put out an album that is refreshingly different, alive, realistic and relatable. For those of you appalled by \\"Dirrty,\\" rest assured there is absolutely nothing else on the album that sounds a thing like it. As a matter of fact, each song has it's own unique sound and genre... but somehow that soulful 40s jazz singer voice ties it all together.<br />Christina is an inspiration to me more than ever now. Not for the way she dresses but for the way she thinks and expresses herself. The first time I heard \\"The Voice Within\\" I actually started to cry. Me! I haven't cried since the first time I listened to Manson's \\"Portrait of an American Family!\\" <br />She has abandoned that old manufactured pop that brought her onto the cover of teen magazines. And you know what? I've never been happier to see someone do that. Her songs are real, her voice is better measured to the songs, and the instrumentals are just better overall.<br />Trash the album if you like, but please don't miss the point of the record. Don't pass judgement before you know what you're talking about. And even if you hate her image and think she's the worst person ever, at least try to recognize that she's realistic.<br />Thank you, Christina. Thank you so much for this album.
B000068TP0|3.0|I would like the option to read in Spanish too. Maybe it is too much to ask but they could add video clips not just the concert
B00006V9A0|1.0|Look, Nirvana's back! The most over-rated band of the last 20 years. Already MTV, VH1 and the rest of the media are promoting this album like crazy. Back in the early 90's, MTV and the media brainwashed the kids into thinking that it is cool to like Nirvana and other \\"grunge\\" groups. And so it happened! <br />This band killed rock n' roll, they paved the way for other bands with no talent, sense of melody or intelligent lyrics. And so we went through a very dark decade in music. <br />I can't imagine how anyone can actually enjoy listening to depressing lyrics screamed over monotonous droning guitars. I guess the people that enjoy this stuff are the same ones who think that Kurt Cobain is a \\"genius.\\" <br />The media says that Nirvana killed off the so-called \\"hair bands.\\" Well, twenty years later Def Leppard and Bon Jovi have new albums out and are still touring. How many \\"grunge\\" bands are still around and relevant today? <br />The \\"grunge\\" era is a time that would be better off forgotten.
0375414053|2.0|I too was drawn in by the editorial reviews of this book being touted as the working mother's Bridgette Jones's diary. I can only guess the reviews were written by men. While I could relate to the guilt felt by our heroine I couldn't help but want to knock her silly. A job that affords her Armani suits and a nanny? Poor lady. Try mothering in the real world. This book is a complete insult to those of us who have to deal with work, kids, an executive position and DON'T have a choice. All my working friends could't wait to read this. I will make sure they don't.<BR>How does she make it in a man's world? Ultimately, according to Allison Pearson, she doesn't.<BR>Spend the {money} on a manicure, you'll feel much better in the end.
B000002KBD|5.0|I wish somebody would tell me what is better than this Van Morrison compilation(Other than Caravan, Glad Tidings and Into the Mystic---My all-time favorites)This is superb Van Morrison. You feel like he's really enjoying the performance and his compadres play off each other. An all-around effort. Wow! Thanks.
B000005J56|5.0|&quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; is the album that ignited my love affair with the rich and warm sounds of Cuban music.  The album's intricate melodies and impassioned vocals glide through these excellent tracks, all produced by Ry Cooder.  But while Cooder takes helm of the production, the real stars are the vocalists and the band members who breathe energy, feeling, and zest into this stellar recording.  The opener &quot;Chan Chan&quot; is a gentle and laid back number equipped with effective percussion, a spicy dash of guitars, and well-harmonized vocals from Eliades Ochoa, Compay Segundo, and Ibrahim Ferrer.  I was left in awe by the pretty melody of &quot;De Camino a La Vereda&quot; and the sharp trumpeting in &quot;El Cuarto de Tula.&quot;  But I was most impressed by the dynamite Ibrahim Ferrer who takes lead vocals in &quot;Candela,&quot; an uptempo number which soars due to tasty acoustic guitars and percussion.  Sensual, tender, emotional, and full of life, &quot;The Buena Vista Social Club&quot; is a towering and riveting experience.  It's a rare beauty that will leave you amazed.
0316666343|1.0|Unable to fathom the hoopla surrounding this book.  I was so anxious to read it, only to be profoundly disappointed.  The plot gave me nightmares and the fantasy element in the book was annoying.  The one redeeming value of this book is that it is relatively short.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I bought the cd today and somewhat disappointed that the whole album sounded just like Mariah Carey.  The first single was a guaranteed hit but the rest of the songs on the album belongs in the bedroom.  If this is the direction Christina is taking, her music will be categorized as pop vocal.  I will play this new music in my office at work and during bedtime.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's new cd, is awesome!!<br />One of the best cd's I have heard in a long time! Her voice is so beautiful, many of the songs are very catchy. The cd has everything! R&B,blues,hip-hop,pop,ballads,rock..Christina gets major props from me on her new album stripped! <br />I can't even pick the best songs, because every track is absolutely perfect. I recommend this cd to everyone! You won't be disappointed!
B00006EXDM|5.0|I have to agree with another reviewer  that too many people are talking about the new sound quality instead of the song quality.I have the &quot;un-remastered version&quot;.I'm sure that the new CD's sound great,but the old ones sounded good too.The bottom line is this:This is a great greatest hits album.If you don't want to plunk down for all those seperate RS albums then get this CD.Even with &quot;Forty Licks&quot;,there still isn't as comprehensive a collection as this covering 1971-the present.Yeah,most of &quot;More Hot Rocks&quot; could have fit on here,but what's here is plenty primo Stones.If they only could have been this consistent in the 70's,80's and 90's.
0316666343|5.0|A perfect book. Delicately, but unforgetably, vioce for people horribly lost, headlined, quantified, and the people who love them. Most people read this because it seemed all of America was doing the same thing. The point of view was interesting and the story of the grieving family kept their attention.<br />However, for the most part I could wrap myself around this one. Perhaps there were too many subplots and minor characters. Also my experctations may have been too high, but the book seemed to really make me seem like I was there. I thingk a movie of this book would make a real good movie. Highly recommended!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina is a Genie Stripped out of her \\"pop\\" bottle in her new Hot & Sizzling new release \\"Stripped\\". Her singles \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Dirty\\" are my favorites.  Wow, 20 songs on a cd, what great value for your money!  She has one of the strongest voice in the industry with range too.  Her strong voice really comes across in this release.  You won't be disappointed in picking this cd up.  Highly recommend!
0385720920|4.0|Chuck Palahniuk is a clunky idea stylist. I initially found the writing to be stilted and laborious but later warmed up to it. This is a quick read, even at near 300 pages. While the overall book does have some structure, most of it only becomes apparent after the 150 pages or so. Unfortunately, this makes the beginning feel like you're wallowing in misery along with the apathetic lead character - Victor Mancini.<br />Victor is like many people in that he's never really live up to his expectations. In fact, he's quit trying. He's a listless sex-addict with an addled mother in the hospital, a poor mindless daily job, a con-artist by evening, who has a friend with even less direction than himself.<br />Victor is happy to take the blame for other people's misfortune, even when he has nothing to do with it - a real sadomasochist. This story is about what happens when Victor's reality gets pulled out from under him and he has to come clean to everyone he's deluded - especially himself. It's also a story about inspiration and how it can be found in the strangest places. Stick through this one to the end. It's worth it. I would think that fans of Irvine Welsh would really like this book.
B000003S0D|5.0|_Lizard_, King Crimson's third studio album, is probably the most strange, surreal (musically and lyrically) and jazziest out of Crimson's 1970's period. It's also very fantasy-laden, ephemeral (in a good way), manic, quirky and idiosyncratic. The biggest contributing factor to this (beside the trippy and surreal jazz-rock), is the underrated and understated contributions of Gordon Haskell (vocals, bass). His dark, brooding and raspy vocals fit perfectly with the dark and regal music found on here. His glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) pipes tend to produce a voice that's unique, idiosyncratic, magnanimous, chivalrous, kingly, regal and moving--almost a deeper-voiced, early incarnation of Peter Gabriel (whom may have been influenced by this album).<br />\\"Cirkus\\" starts off magically, then explodes into a forbidding nightmare of ominously gallant synthesizers and backdrops. The jazzy drumming of Andy McCulloch (or McCullogh, I've seen two different names, so I'm not sure which one is accurate), is also something to behold throughout the album. \\"Indoor Games\\" features tasteful r&b-esque guitar playing from Robert Fripp. Very idiosyncratic, ambiguous and almost indescribable jazz-rock tune. \\"Happy Family\\" is a \\"pandemonium\\" of dissonant unity amongst all the players: synths, flutes, guitars--and more. A real messy track (I mean that in the most flattering way). \\"Lady Of The Dancing Water\\" is a short, ethereal and mellow flute-laden track which brings reminiscence to Cadence And Cascade (from _In The Wake Of Poseidon_). Ironically, \\"Cadence\\" is the track Gordon Haskell sang vocals for. That raspy voice heard here sounds nothing like the mellow voice heard on that ditty found on the previous album. Arguably, this track also gives an utter hint of things to come on the follow-up album, _Islands_. \\"Lizard\\", the title track, is a 23-minute dark, jazzy/symphonic epic, featuring Jon Anderson (Yes) singing lead vocals for the first movement. Personally, I was saddened to know that Gordon Haskell didn't complete all the vocal duties. Jon Anderson does an excellent job on his vocals.

B000002G8H|4.0|Slowhand is clearly one of Eric Clapton's stronger solo releases. Whereas there are plenty of guitar solos and effects, many of these tunes are quite pleasing. A little bit mellow but certainly quite focused.<br />The lead off track, Cocaine features a very distnictive riff and steady instrumental support. Like the gutiar solo in the middle. Wonderful Tonight will always be known as a classic wedding song. One of Eric's best compositions. Lay Down Sally features some mellow guitar picking and a nice chugging rhythm. Next Time You See Her features some good drumming by Jaime Oldaker in addition to some tasty guitar licks. We're All The Way is a pleasant focused ballad.<br />The second half kicks off with a riveting duet between Eric and Marcy Levy on the Core. Super guitar solos by George Terry and Eric as well as a good saxaphone break by Mel Collins. May You Never is a catchy tune with cute vocal styling by Eric. Mean Old Frisco is a fine blues number and Peaches And Diesel is a pretty instrumental with touching guitar parts.<br />A solid if not overly spectacular release that showcases the mellow side of Eric Clapton.
B00000K3CK|5.0|I can't think of a better Christmas movie, this is a total classic and has never failed to get me in the Christmas spirit.<BR>I've never found out why it makes me cry, but its never failed to do that either. For me its the ending when Susan runs down the stairs and tells her mother she was right &quot;mommy said even when things don't turn out just right you still have to believe, and oh mommy I do believe, I do&quot; and at that point I know I can feel the tears starting to come in my eyes and by the end I'm done for, but this is a beauitful movie, that can make anyone believe in Santa Claus :)
B00006V9A0|2.0|The remaining members of Nirvana wanted the bands previously unreleased gem \\"You Know You're Right\\" to be released with a batch of other rarities in a box set of \\"new\\" material.  Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, wanted to be able to use Nirvana's name and the much-hyped new tune as a bargaining chip in a new deal with Universal Records.  She won in the courts, and now the song has been tacked on as the obligitory new track on a collection of 13 songs that have been released and heard a million times before.<br />Nirvana doesn't lend itself well to compilation because they only released 3 albums that each sound very, very different.  It's not very expensive and a much more rewarding decision to buy each of the three albums rather than this cheesy \\"Greatest Hits\\" record, something it's hard to imagine a living Kurt Cobain authorizing.  The songs are good, but a lot of the groups best work is missing here and the arrangement leaves a lot to be desired.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am Christina Aguilera fan, I admit it. I have always been in love with her voice and have so much respect for it.  Her first LP was indeed very teen-booper and record-company laid out.  Christina had a chance to show the world she had a great voice but unfortunately on her octaves were heard, not her emotions.  This is totally different on Stripped.  Christina breaks away her mirror image Britney Spears.  Do not be fooled by the first single \\"Dirrty\\" or her sexy, untamed new image to let you think this album is trashy or lusty or even worse bubble-gum pop.  This album is feeled with so much emotions and talent.  Christina allows her voice to soar on every single song and even showing that she can change tempos and genres of music in every song.  She displays pure heartache and probably her most powerful ballad on \\"Walk Away\\".  Such songs as \\"THe voice within\\" and \\"Soar\\" and \\"Keep on singing my song\\" offers hope and inspiration to all her fans about being happy with yourself and loving yourself.  The saucy and sassy \\"Infatuation\\" offers a Spanish flair that tells a love story.  \\"Can't hold us down\\" is a catchy up-beat girls anthem likewise to Destiny's Child \\"Independent Women\\".  The song \\"Impossible\\" produced by Grammy winner Alicia Keys lives up to its expectation and is definitely a masterpiece.  \\"Beautiful\\" is one of the refreshing and feel good ballads I've heard in awhile.  \\"Get Mine, Get yours\\" is a clever, sexy mid-tempo song that tells of a secret love affair.  \\"Make-over\\" one of the four songs by Linda Perry is an alternative-rock song that shows Christina's multi-faceted voice.  Overall this album is relatively flawless, every song has a special meaning and is very well produced and arranged.  There are absolutely no fillers.  If you appreciate music even if you dont like Christina...this CD is definitely worth the [money]. Please don't miss out on great effort by a woman that has so much to say.
B00006V9A0|5.0|First of all, \\"You Know You're Right\\" is a great recording.  Not the best Nirvana track per se, but still a welcome treat in this dreadful era of the Justin/Britney we have to endure.  Kurt's voice sounds amazingly like he did on BLEACH in the verses which really surprised me.  The real treat on NIRVANA is, like many compilations, it does use the occasional different version.  Case in point, \\"Been A Son\\" is NOT the INCESTICIDE version (it's from the BLEW E.P.), \\"Pennyroyal Sea\\" is a 1994 remix that was meant as the next single off IN UTERO but was shelved when Kurt died and the version of \\"All Apologies\\" is from the MTV UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK album.  Every other track is as we know them.  What else can I say?  It's Nirvana's best-of collection of hit songs and it TOWERS above most of the dredge we have to listen to today.  Rest in peace, Kurt.  Thanks Nirvana!
B00005JL2O|2.0|The first 15 minutes of this movie is the funniest thing about this movie.There are some other funny parts,but this movie is weak.The character Goldmember ruined the movie.This movie is dissapointing.The best Austin Powers movie is,and forever will be,Part 2.<br />Peace Out
B00006CXXU|3.0|She has come back after 'genie in a bottle' and boy oh boy, she seems to have become another Britney Spears. Posing half nude on the cover n inside of the booklet + the sexy 'Dirty' video, one wonder what make her change so much. She has claim this is the real her, so i'm wondering what are we seeing here, her or was she jealous about Britney success n decide to go down her way too. Her song on this album remind me how Britney went from 'Baby one more time' to Oops i did it again, more cheesy, more sexier n more woman? One advantage about her been so successful would be her voice. This is one Britney cannot win, this allow her to able to work with much more talented artist such as Lil kim and Alicia Keys. I loved 'Walk Away' remind me of Alicia Keys style of song, though this is not written by Alicia herself. 'Impossible' is the one, quite a nice song. Christina co-wrote most of the song her in this album. Maybe Alicia can give her some advice on becoming a favourite artist rather than like her album suggest stripped.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|People, this one is a winnner. The album is crazy, it's nuts, it's insane, it's simply a masterpiece. Eminem did his thing on this one along with his Shady records counterparts including Obie Trice, 50 Cent and D12. Em opens up the soundtrack with the adrenaline rushed \\"Lose Yourself\\" which tells you how to take an oppourtunity when it comes your way espically if life is not treating you so well. That song should be inspiration and motivation to all inspiring rappers out there. Em also does his thing on \\"8 Mile\\". He just went crazy on this one spitting fire  like its the last track that he's making. I really felt him on that one. You also got the tight track from my man Nas called \\"Wanna Be Me\\". He completely finished off Jay-Z with this track. I won't be surprised if Jigga reitres from the game. But Jay-Z handled his business with Freeway on \\"8 Miles and Runnin'\\". I was really feeling that one. This album also got the street anthem \\"Wanksta\\" by 50 Cent and a new song by 50 Cent called \\"Places to Go\\" which is off the hook. The album also includes tracks from veterans Gangstarr and Rakim. The only dissapointments were pitiful tracks by Boomkat and Macy Gray. I don't know why they made it to the album. All in all, this album is wonderful. It is the best soundtrack i've ever heard and the movie is going to be hot. Alright im out,1
B00006CXXU|5.0|i was thoroughly impressed w/ what i heard. the slower ballads were very well written and so powerfully sung. i got chills from hearing her voice soar beyond the scale. there are a lot of great beats on this album also. there are four songs that make buying this album completely worth it to any skeptics out there: 9. &quot;impossible&quot;; 11. &quot;beautiful&quot;; 18. &quot;the voice within&quot;; and 19. &quot;i'm okay.&quot; the whole cd is really good, however, those songs grab you in a way that i've never been pulled in by music before. i 100% recommend buying this cd. it's a wonderful display of her talent.
B00006J3WH|5.0|What a delicious treat! This album is fun and accessible, although Buffy fans will most enjoy the in-jokes and plot developments. The whole cast is great, and the songs are as good as those in any Broadway musical - better, in fact, than most. There are moments both funny and sad - a classic Buffy trademark. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sing along. <br />The sad thing about Buffy-the-show, as well as Buffy-the-musical, is that they really are too good for the audience and genre. Buffy is so much better and deeper than it needs to be, although with an unlikely enough horror premise to turn most people off. But don't be fooled - Buffy is art - high- and low- brow, often simultaneously. Come join the party!
B00005JKDR|5.0|'Monsters, Inc.' is the story of what happens behind the closet door. There's a whole world of children-fearing monsters back there. Some are good, some are evil, and all are funny.<br />In case you aren't familiar with Pixar, all their movies are computer animated. In my opinion, they produce the highest quality animated movies out today. I think they've passed up their cousin, the Disney traditionally animated movie. 'Monsters, Inc.' is just as good as all the other Pixar movies: 'Toy Story', 'A Bugs Life', and 'Toy Story 2'. Every member of your family will enjoy 'Monsters, Inc.' - there are jokes and gags in there for everyone.<br />Pixar also knows how to package a DVD. There are tons of special features. Especially funny is the outtakes. Buy this movie - and lock your child's door.
B00006V9A0|3.0|First off, how do you box up and encase the sound of one of the most influential bands of the twentieth century? This is just a horrible ploy to make quick cash over a band that has been extinct for over eight years. Just when you thought it was over, the record label decides to yank out an old unreleased tune called 'You Know You're Right' and release an entire Greatest Hits CD to go along with it.<br />Let me give you five simple reasons why you shouldn't buy this album:<br />1) 'You Know You're Right' does not even come CLOSE to being being one of Nirvana's 'greatest hits'.<BR>2) Essential Nirvana tunes 'Heart-Shaped Box' and 'Aneurysm' are not included.<BR>3) Four of the songs are off of 'Nevermind', four from 'In Utero'. Chances are you probably already have both of these.<BR>4) If you were a true Nirvana fan, you'd already have all these songs by now!<BR>5) A substantial amount of money made off this recording goes back to Courtney Love, which is exactly what she wants.<br />>> 3 stars. You would normally imagine a Nirvana greatest hits CD to score much higher than 5 stars, but when you actually stop and think about what you are buying (13, technically 14, old Nirvana tunes), it doesn't seem quite that worth it after all. Just go ahead and buy all their other CDs. It's a better bargain anyways.<br />- the enlightened one
B00005JKG7|4.0|The Fog is one of the best movies John Carpenter ever made, period. Also every scene is perfect. John Houseman as the old codger telling a ghost story to the kids, Adrienne Barbeau heading to work in that horribly isolated light house, the dread that builds when the electricity goes haywire,the first sight of the ghosts, poor old Mrs. Kobritz standing in that foggy doorway.....the tension never once lets up. Unlike most of the films made in this era it has aged well. My only quibble has to do with Father Malone and his grandfather...Fahter Malone. I realize he's an Episcopalian priest but that should've been spelled out in the movie so the one unintentially funny moment could've been skipped. All in all, this flick is just about perfect.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is an incredible difference from her first cd. She co-wrote almost every track on the album, and it shows. She moves into very different territory on this album. But it is a welcoming change. Her voice shines clearly on this album. She has really grown up. If you think that Britney is all grown up, think again. Christina is by far more talented and grown up, as this album shows. Clocking in at 77:20, this CD is not a short experiance at all, like Britney's newest cd at only about 39 minutes. If you are looking for quality and perfection and excellent work done by an outstanding woman, pick this CD up. I promise you won't regret it. I don't.
0151008116|5.0|Why would a character be named after a transcendental number which reappears in many mathematical expressions?  Why the need for the zoological prologue that consumes so much paper in this book?  Why is the divine so desperately sought by a child?  Why when Pi enters Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is &quot;the horror...the horror&quot; never acknowledged but embraced, and perhaps loved as sublime?

I have so many bad nights to choose from that I've made none the champion.&quot; <BR>   Find one of these and you may find why this book has so infected subtle readers for the breeze by which it sails and to all others for the airy telling of a good tale that admonishes both sorts that; &quot;This story has a happy ending.&quot;<BR>At last, the author opens up both the characters and the reader to accept whichever fiction they choose to believe and isn't that, ultimately, what each of us do all of time anyway?

B00006CXXU|4.0|Every Christina Aguilera record has become an event worth anticipating, if only for the reason that shes one of the few young women in the business at the moment who can actually sing. While 'Stripped' technically is her fifth album (counting her debut 'Christina Aguilera', 'My Kind of Christmas', 'Mi Reflejo', and the unauthorized 'Just be Free'), its clearly the most polished, most slick and decidedly the best solo female record since Madonna's 'Music' a few years ago. However, while that record was criticized for being too short, this one excels in that department. Clocking in at 80 minutes, 'Stripped' is one of the longest single-disc-CDs ever released, and makes its mark by giving us one quality track after another.<br />Christina's strength has always been her voice and its clear that she respects this talent. The songs all showcase her breathtaking vocals, and save for the single 'Dirrty', this is probably an album you could gift your aunt or grandmother who has a fondness for Aretha Franklin. Yes, its THAT good and that diverse. I'm especially picky about pop music these days and tend to steer clear of 'teen-pop' as the entire genre reeks of Occidental marketing at its' worst, but when a quality product such as 'Stripped' hits the shelves, you can't help but notice.<br />The range the singer displays on this record is amazing. It bears mentioning that after the release of this album, any comparisons to moppet Spears will prove nonsensical. In places, the songstress reminded my of Gladys Knight and the Pips, and some of the melodies hark back to the era of the Supremes. Like I said earlier, the fact that this is a very varied record gives it that much more credibility. If you liked Alicia Keyes' 'Songs' album, you will undoubtedly fall in love with this one. Its much better that Keyes' effort simply because it bears no signs of confusion or directionlessness. Each track flows into the next with ease, and the result is a sparkling pop masterpiece that is well worth anyone's time.<br />Lead single 'Dirrty' turns out to be the weak spot on the album. While it is certainly a mediocre tune, it sounds much better on CD that one would image. The track is multilayered with instrumentation that is completely lost in the music video. The album has its fair share of ballads (especially the soaring 'Beautiful', and the poignant 'Walk Away'). There are Pink-tinged tunes such as 'Underappreciated' and 'Make Over' and even a collaboration with L'il Kim that isn't as bad as one would think. While Christina has collaborated with a multitude of performers, at no stage is it a case of 'took many cooks spoil the broth'. And I cannot remember the last time an album had no 'fillers'. At the end of it, I felt I had listened to an ALBUM, which is more than I can say for other new artists such as Avril Lavigne or Jessica Simpson.<br />'Stripped' could get five stars, but I'm holding out on one star due to the image that Christina has chosen to portray. Granted that a beautiful young woman has every right to flaunt it, but this may serve to alienate listeners who would, for example, also listen to Norah Jones 'Come Away with Me' (my personal favorite of the year so far). If the image wasn't so tarty, 'Stripped' could well been the musical story of the year.<br />There are a few albums that share the same qualities and vibe that 'Stripped' does : 'Janet' by Janet Jackson, 'Come Away with me' by Norah Jones, 'Misunderstood' by Pink, and 'Eli and the Thirteenth Confession' by Laura Nyro. It also has the same spirit that Courtney Love's band Hole sported on their last album. This is a very urban and contemporary record, yet it has its own classic, almost jazz-like flavor.<br />If you are looking for one album this year that covers all musical genres and delivers on the vocal front, let it be this one. And in case you were always somewhat interested in what young people these days were listening to, give this one a listen. It may open doors to areasof new musical interest for you.of new musical interest for you.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|After much waiting, ET finally comes \\"home\\" on DVD ! <br />I have to say that I was really looking forward for this much loved movie to come on DVD so I can add it to my collection. Growing up, ET has always had a special place in my heart and mind as being one of the very first films that touched me deeply. I have to admit that the first time I revisited the movie after 20 years, I still tear up at the same scenes as I did when I was 10 watching the original release in the local cinema.<br />The DVD itself is a real value buy. Having both the 2002 and original release in the same package is brilliant! The picture and sound quality is astounding for a film that is 20 years old. I didn't really think that the new additions in the 2002 release made ET any less enjoyable than the original. To me, they just added a little more detail to the viewing experience. In truth, I'm just happy that ET finally is on DVD.<br />The extras included in this package are appropriate enough for this movie. Most telling are the mini featurettes on the ET 20th Anniversary Premier and the cast reunion. I have yet to go through the production slide show but from little I've seen of it, it was a very comprehensive collection. I didn't see any menu link for a commentary track so I assume that it wasn't included. I wished that it was as such a significant movie like ET deserves one ... especially one from the cast and director. We are only given a little bit of the thought process that went into the creation of the movie from the featurettes that would really be well recieved if it was expended into a commetary track.<br />On the minus side, I thought that the DVD case design was a bit ill concieved. It felt flimsy and may even fall apart after a few years. I wished that they had made a better DVD case for this package that would not only look good on the shelves but also able to protect this precious movie for a long time. In fact, I would mind paying a bit more if they released this packagein a metal DVD case like the one that Akira Special Edition (ASIN: B00005MAM2) came in.<br />All in all, this is one DVD that is well worth the wait. After 20 years, we can now return to the same sense of wonder that we experience watching how simple things was for a boy and his new best \\"friend\\". Uncluttered by the difference that divide them, the two characters manage to bridge the gap and form a lasting bond. I wished that more people would take this lesson to heart in this day and age.<br />As a conclusion, this DVD package is a real good value for money purchase to add to your collection.
B00005NWM3|4.0|The other person who wrote, \\"Can I take it back?\\" seems to really hate Nickelback. I on the other hand love this cd. Every one hates to buy a cd and find out they only like one or two songs. I think that true Nickelback fans will agree this cd is good. After hearing a bunch of their songs on the radio I went to check their new cd out. I was really surprised to find all the songs I love from the radio on one cd. Test out the song samples above and see what you think. As far as complaining and whining goes that is what most rock/metal is, complaining, yelling and good old angry music. That's the point. If I want to hear happy music I will listen to my kids Pokemon cd.
B00006LWSF|3.0|OK, when I first saw the songlist for this soundtrack, I was blown away.  Nas, Gangstarr, Xzibit, Rakim.  All great artists, with a little bit of Shady Records filler (Obie Trice, 50 Cent, D12) in between.  Since the majority of the kids will buy this soundtrack solely for the lead-off single \\"Lose Yourself\\", which is a fine song, it doesn't really matter what I say about the rest of the album.  But for those who know a good line-up when they see it, I'll tell you now: This CD (...)!  The first and last songs, by Eminem, are the only really good ones on here, and the rest are just weak!  I at least expected Gangstarr to come through, but that song just cements my theory that DJ Premier has fallen off.  There's not much more to say about the 8 Mile soundtrack, except that a single song is NOT worth $15.  Download this off the net, if possible, or just burn it.  You've been warned.
B00006CXXU|2.0|Christina Aguilera has a great voice, she just needs to get better material.  I was relieved, however, to discover that the rest of the CD is not at all similar to 'Dirrty.'  Basically, Christina has decided to ditch bubblegum pop and go for a more R&B/rock sound.  Still, considering the amount of time it took to make this CD, I was let down.  There are a few good tracks, like 'Beautiful'and 'Can't Hold Us Down.  If your looking for an innovative album, you're looking in the wrong place.  \\"Stripped\\" is nothing more than your average pop-princess-decides-she-wants-to-stand-out-so-she-runs-to-'cool'-producers album.  Unfortunately, Linda Perry couldn't do for Christina what she did for P!NK.

B000002LQQ|4.0|As a long time fan, it's hard for me to really consider this a Dire Straits album. \\"On Every Street\\" is a departure in two ways: the most obvious, of course, is that it's the band's last album. The second is the new and different sound Mark has created. With the exception of \\"Heavy Fuel\\" and \\"The Bug\\" revisiting familiar territory from \\"Brothers In Arms\\" this release embraces more styles  and influences than you'd ever expect from a standard DS release. The new, more polished sound is a perfect evolution for Mark, but seems a little out of character for the rest of the band. For these reasons, \\"On Every Street\\" seems more like Mark Knopfler's first solo album than his band's swan song. That said, some of my favorite work from the band is on this CD. \\"Planet of New Orleans,\\" \\"Fade to Black,\\" \\"When it Comes to You,\\" \\"You and Your Friend\\" and \\"On Every Street\\" are not only good, they're classics. Unfortunately there are a couple throw-aways in the mix as well. \\"Heavy Fuel\\" is a shameless, less clever, poor man's version of \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Calling Elvis,\\" while a serviceable tune, is about five minutes too long. \\"My Parties\\" is fun, but not anything you'll need to hear more than once. However, the vast majority of the tracks are gems and over all this album is a must-have for anyone moved by Mark's work.

B00006CXXU|4.0|Okay, okay! She does create an image of just another 'tart' singing trite pop songs, but there is more to Christina Aguilera than meets the eye---surprising though that might be from her image. The quality that sets her apart is that she holds in her possession an incredible instrument in her voice. She is not just another pop singer or teen idol. She deserves to be recognized as a singer who is in the league of the Holy Trinity of new female soul singers (Kelly Price, Faith Evans and Mary J. Blige). Though scantily clad, her full body voice adds some layers to a seemingly shallow singer. <br />The disc offers up some incredible songs and vocals. The only drawback to the disc is the choice of some of the material (the Linda Perry written tracks) and the fact that Christina can over-sing at times. \\"Walk Away\\" is a powerful, brooding blues record that would make Etta James proud and Christina seems perfectly at home in that genre as well. The latin-tinged \\"Infatuation\\", complete with spanish guitar is another on which the singer shines. It's also a genre with which Christina seems comfortable..see 2000's stunning 'Mi Reflejo'. The disc presses on with the romantic, mature \\"Loving Me For Me\\". To follow this is the Alicia Keys composed \\"Impossible\\". Alicia certainly has done her homework on the Queen of Soul, Aretha. This track seems to be the combination of three classic Aretha songs. The airy piano opening hearkens back to the Regent's opening of the classic \\"Daydreamin\\" while the body of the song seems more inspired by Franklin classics \\"Ain't No Way\\" and \\"Natural Woman\\". In spite of these interpolations, or perhaps because of them, the solitary thing that makes this record so outstanding is Christina's powerhouse vocal. Other inspired tracks include \\"Underappreciated\\", the majestic \\"Soar\\" and the raunchy, adult \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\". Not only has she matured as an artist, but this disc heralds the advent of the woman that she has become.<br />There are, however, songs that are not suited for the singer at all. Most notably among these tracks is \\"Dirrty\\". It's a great song to dance to at a club, but it does it does nothing for Christina in the way of displaying her actual talents. Additionally, the Linda Perry penned tracks don't seem to hit home either as Christina does not seem capable of singing rock songs. And the failed studio experiment \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" (which features the ever torrid Lil Kim) sees Christina offering up garbled, slurred vocals which are reminiscent of the lesser-talented Beyonce Knowles.<br />In all, this disc is one of the best Pop/Soul records to be released this year. Christina's powerhouse voice and the great production of this album seem the perfect vehicle to catapult this singer into being the Diva that she wishes to become. Don't be fooled by her outward appearance. The girl can sing and actually has talents, though her manner of dress would lead you to believe that she'd rather you didn't know.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I don't think i need to say a whole lot here. Nirvana was one of the best bands ever, and this is a collection of their best songs. I hope you don't need to be convinced to buy it. But if you do, here goes:  this CD has everything a rock fan could want (tortured vocals and lyrics, hard riffs, melodic ballads, etc.), it is a worthy representation of the band that revolutionized modern rock, and I'd list the many more reasons if i didn't procratinate on my social studies project that is due tomorrow. Just buy the friggin' CD.
B000002HJD|4.0|American Prayer is an interesting album--as much for the jazzy and atmospheric music the band added as for Jim's poetry.  That said, I have to take issue with the Amazon \\"official\\" reviewer's cheap shots at Morrison and the Doors.  That kind of sneering put-down contradicts his apparent sense of critical superiority.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's follow-up to her debut album is amazing, for lack of a better word.  On &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot;, Christina was strugglig with vocal gymnastics and couldn't quite find her niche.  It was a great album, but it was too sugar-coated and sweet for anyone to listen to repeatedly for a great amount of time.  Now,though, Christina has come back with vengeance.  She mixes jazz, rock, and pop to create a unique, flawless album.  She has certainly grown up, swearing in &quot;Make Over&quot; and thanking a past lover for giving her strength in &quot;Fighter&quot;.  <BR>Comparisons with Mariah Carey are inevitable, for Christina is the only artist since Mariah to show so much talent.  Also noteworthy is the fact that she actually co-writes the songs.  Few artists are willing to stray from he cookie-cutter mold of a pop artist.  However, these artists are unable to move with time.  Christina's album shows that she wants to make timeless music..and she has succeeded in doing so.
630151940X|3.0|This video is not all that bad. The author tried his best and gives a lot of information and compared to most, it is more thorough.<br />The reviewer from Lubbock, Texas who claims that you should not bother with any videos and only a teacher completely misses the point. It's like saying, don't go to the library and get books, go to school! One is not a substitute for the other! They can work synergistically with each other!
6304316267|4.0|For different speed-obsessed, (like me, he-he-he) personality traits, James Bond to a couple of country boys, from a business man and his heavy-set driving partner, to a couple of phony priests driving a red Ferrari, this movie was a great, fun time of laughs, comedy, and entertainment. Oh, I almost forgot, Dom Deluise as Captain Chaos is both off the wall, but yet funny.<br />I only wish there would've been more detail in some areas like with Bond picking up the girls, more time on that red Ferrari, showing that big, muscular guy who was holding up a van showing more feats of strength, some more of that Shiek in the white Rolls Royce seducing women and to show who be more successful, Bond or the Shiek, and finally I guess, with just all the different characters, it just would've been nice if the movie would've been a tad longer, maybe as long as the Godfather. If this movie were extended and in more detail like the Godfather 1 or 2, then this movie in my opinion, would be just as good as the Godfather 2, if not better!<br />Other than that, that's all I feel like saying about this great movie.<br />Steveman
B00006NSZ5|5.0|Nice Beats, Lyrics And All.<BR>Another Soundtrack With The Best
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is a great album. There is no \\"pop tart\\" type stuff that Britany Spears seems to have stuck with. There is an amazing authenticity to all of the songs, many of which were co-written by Aguilera. There are many types of songs from R&B to hard rock to jazz to soft \\"diva\\" ballads. Don't let the hype around her new sexy attitude fool you, this is a high quality album and is a must have for any fan of popular music.
B000006TRV|5.0|\\"The Wall,\\" Pink Floyd's 1979 concept album about a rock star's mental breakdown, is a towering monster. It's an album with SO many audio, lyrical, musical & emotional nooks and crannies contained within, that one listen simply will not cut it. \\"The Wall\\" is not just an album to listen to, it's an album to be *explored*. It was inspired by then-bandleader Roger Waters' own mental collapse at the end of the Floyd's tour for the \\"Animals\\" album. Due to the grind of the mammoth stadium tour for \\"Animals,\\" and sickened by seeing his own band, in his opinion, become part of the rock business \\"circus,\\" Waters was mentally & emotionally exhausted beyond comprehension. At the final gig in Montreal, Waters finally snapped, spitting in the face of a young fan sitting up front. Coming home to England to recover, Waters finally decided to exorcise his demons by writing a conceptual piece about his disgust with his life as a rock star, and he began building \\"The Wall\\"....With the bulk of the double-album composed by Waters (with a few co-writing contributions from guitarist David Gilmour & producer Bob Ezrin), \\"The Wall\\" tells the story of a rock star named Pink and his downward spiral into madness, and all the things in his life that led him there: his father killed in the war when he was only a baby (\\"Another Brick In The Wall Part 1\\"), being smothered by his overbearing mother (\\"Mother\\"), subjected to abuse at school (\\"The Happiest Days Of Our Lives\\"/\\"Another Brick In The Wall Part 2\\"), and later, the pressures of his rock-star lifestyle (\\"One Of My Turns\\") and the breakdown of his marriage (\\"Don't Leave Me Now\\"). Quite simply, \\"The Wall\\" is a rock masterwork, and arguably Roger Waters' greatest achievement as a composer. However, to think of the album simply as a \\"Roger Waters production\\" would be wrong. Though Waters IS, indeed, the main architect of \\"The Wall,\\" bravely wearing his heart on his sleeve with his powerful songwriting and tortured singing (not to mention playing a mean bass throughout), the album still would not be what it is without the excellent contributions of guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour, who also shines on tracks like the smash hit, \\"Another Brick In The Wall Part 2\\" (featuring his most famous guitar solo ever recorded with the band), \\"Goodbye Blue Sky,\\" \\"Young Lust,\\" \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (featuring yet another classic Gilmour guitar solo). Keyboardist Richard Wright & drummer Nick Mason are, admittedly, dwarfed somewhat on \\"The Wall\\" by the inclusion of various session players (that's Jeff Porcaro playing drums on \\"Mother,\\" to name one example). Still, Mason & Wright appear often enough, and they make their contributions count. The production on \\"The Wall\\" is also astounding---from the great stereophonic mix of the tunes themselves, to the treasure trove of sound effects & voices (such as fighter planes, helicopters, objects being smashed, singing schoolchildren, a telephone operator, a TV set playing \\"Gomer Pyle,\\" and on and on), \\"The Wall\\" is truly a listening *experience*. Thankfully, Roger Waters, having left Pink Floyd in 1983, is living quite comfortably these days, no longer bothered by his rock star demons, and he continues to make great music on his own (he's also much more appreciative of his live audiences these days, thank goodness). Obviously for Waters, making \\"The Wall\\" was much-needed therapy. For Pink Floyd, \\"The Wall\\" became one of the group's biggest best-sellers, second only to \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\" For the listener, \\"The Wall\\" is a spellbinding musical journey. It's music is at turns beautiful, haunting, and unquestionably powerful, and it's story is an absolutely gripping one. \\"The Wall\\" is a timeless, undisputed Pink Floyd classic.
630233683X|5.0|i think Singin' in the Rain is the best musical ever! everyone should see it. its funny, has a great plot, and a fabulous cast. I've seen it atleast ten times now, and i still love it, i could honestly watch it over and over again.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is what every Christina fan has been waiting for - as promised, you can hear her incredible voice, without over-trilling, or whatever you want to call it, on every track.<br />I was surprised by the diversity of the tracks.  Dirrty is actually really different than anything else on the album.  While I love that song, it was nice to hear a range of styles, from lots of smooth &quot;Butterfly&quot;-ish Mariah-sounding stuff and interludes to the heavy guitar anthem-ish &quot;Fighter&quot; to an alterna-pop, somewhat Pink-ish &quot;Make-over&quot;.  There's also &quot;Soar&quot;, which has some Dixie-Chicks-ish harmony at the beginning, and &quot;Impossible&quot;, which sounds exactly how you would expect an Alicia Keys song to sound.  <br />All in all, it's a great melange with the strength and versatility of Christina's vocals throughout.  I think a lot of people will be surprised by the depth of the album, given the weak material of her first album.  It's such a welcome change to hear her singing material worthy of her voice!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is quite possibly the most human CD we've seen come out of any pop star. It is also a revolution in the pop world as we know it. Dirrty set a horrible pretense for the album (although I like the song) and may have lost her some respect, but don't let it decide for you. This record is a folley of beautiful ballads and fun upbeat songs. All are true though.<br />1. Stripped Intro (1:39) - A short intro that is a rather cool idea, it mentions Britney (my favorite artist!), Eminem, and Fred Durst. Not really a song, until the end that is. It can't really be rated.<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down (ft. Lil' Kim) (4:15) 10/10 - An EXTREMELY fun song featuring Lil' Kim. This song is about girl power. Now, I'm not a girl, but I totally agree with the message conveyed. There is a little swearing in it. Near the end, you get to hear what sounds like a remix.<br />3. Walk Away (5:47) 9/10 - A sad song about leaving someone who isn't worth loving. It's really slow and piano driven, but it's quite beautiful. It does, however, take getting used to.<br />4. Fighter (ft. Dave Navarro) (4:05) 10/10 - My favorite song. This song starts out classical, but surprises you as it almost immediatly jumps into a rock song. It's really inspiring and upbeat. It's theme is similar to \\"Stronger\\"<br />5. Primer Amor Interlude (0:53) - A really cool interlude with spanish speaking and a spanish guitar. I wish I knew what she was saying.<br />6. Infatuation (4:17) 10/10 - A fun spanish influenced song about falling deeply in love. It's upbeat in a unique way. This song was sung at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Great song.<br />7. Loves Embrace Interlude (0:46) - Er...<br />8. Loving Me 4 Me (4:36) 7/10 - This song is really slow and peaceful. It's Mariah Carey esque. It also sounds like something YES would do... I don't really like it that much. Good meaning.<br />9. Impossible (ft. Alicia Keys) (4:14) 9/10 - This is a bluesy song. Great though. It's definately something Alicia would do. The first minute of the track is basically Alicia and Christina talking however...<br />10. Underappreciated (4:00) 6/10 - What!?...It's like a wannabe funk song. I guess it's good if you're drunk. The meaning is pretty good.<br />11. Beautiful (3:58) 10/10 - The song everyone raves about. It's a great song, and I didn't realize it until I bought the CD. As the title says, it's beautiful. Definately a stand-out track.<br />12. Make Over (4:12) 9/10 - WHAT!?!?! Where did THIS come from? So out of place! It's really good though. It's an upbeat song with arabic influences. It's probably the most bizarre track on the entire album. It sounds like Shakira's \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" also known as \\"Ojos Asi\\".<br />13. Cruz (3:49) 10/10 - A pretty song about leaving home...It makes me cry. It reminds you of how short life really is. People are always so excited to leave home when they become adults...but it's really sad.<br />14. Soar (4:45) 9/10 - Inspirational? Yes. This song is pretty, but it's a little too happy for me to give it a 10. Still, I'm not saying it's bad. Definately NOT.<br />15. Get Mine Get Yours (3:44) 9/10 - A fun upbeat song, although the chorus leaves a little to be desired. The intro sounds A LOT like Can't Hold Us Down. Pretty cool song.<br />16. Dirrty (ft. Redman) (4:58) 10/10 - A lot of people say this song ***. I really like it. You've all heard it by now... Great song. It's the first single and video. The video is well...dirrty.<br />17. Stripped Pt. 2 (0:45) - A continuation of the intro. It's not really able to be rated.<br />18. The Voice Within (5:04) 10/10 - A cool song! It's about being true to yourself. It's a ballad. It's bitter sweet. Great song to listen to when you're down.<br />19. I'm OK (5:18) 10/10!! - THE BEST BALLAD ON THE ALBUM! So incredibly sad. DO NOT listen to this if you are currently unhappy. It will make you MORE UNHAPPY. Listen to sparingly. It's about a dad who beats his wife. SAD!!<br />20. Keep On Singing My Song (6:29) 8/10 - While inspirational, it's not that great sounding. The true highlight of the song is at the very end. You hear Christina fooling around with people in the studio. They then thank you for listening and say goodbye.<br />Overall, BUY THIS ALBUM! It is NOT a waste of money in any shape or form. While one or two songs skim filler teritory, there are truly no fillers (Except for Loves Embrace Interlude...but who cares about the interludes :P)
B00006CXXU|5.0|If people could get past her half naked body in her first video, they can see that Christina Aguilera is an amazing talent.  On this album she really showcases her voice.  She has grown even more vocally (if that's at all possible for her) and it shows. This album has a mixture of everything - rock, pop, r&amp;b and blues.  My favorites are Dirrty, Beautiful and Impossible.  I would be seriously disappointed if this album does not go platinum , maybe even double platinum - she deserves it.    You go girl!
B00006RINF|5.0|The Coil is back and has lost none of the steam they built up when releasing the excellent &quot;Unleashed Memories,&quot; coming back with this superb collection of 13 tracks of loneliness, introspection, and sadness, simultaneously managing to make them catchy and &quot;sing-along-with-able.&quot; [How's that for a made-up-on-the-spot term?]  <br />There seems to be even more of a &quot;metal&quot; feel to this one than there was on &quot;Memories,&quot; and male vocalist Andrea gets to do a little more on vocals than he did previously, though of course he sounds best when harmonizing with the often haunting, often sultry, and always intoxicating vocals of female vocalist Cristina Scabbia. (And as an added bonus, she's cute, too.)  <br />Creative touches abound, such as the unusual &quot;CD Skip&quot; effect in the middle of &quot;Aeon&quot; and the &quot;radio vocal&quot; samples in songs like &quot;Angel's Punishment&quot; and &quot;Tight Rope.&quot;  Keyboards are prevalent, but never overwhelm the often-VERY-heavy guitar sound or the vocal interplay.  <br />Production is spectacular all the way through. High points are difficult to pick out because the whole album is so well-done, though &quot;Swamped&quot; and &quot;Daylight Dancer&quot; are my current faves after about five listens.  Comparing this to the other Coil albums, it's already my second favorite and rapidly closing in on &quot;Unleashed Memories.&quot;<br />Bottom Line: I had high hopes for this album.  Usually when I set such high standards based on a previous release, I get disappointed.  Not this time.  The Coil delivers a masterwork of melodic, gothic metal that is NOT to be missed if you're a fan of the style.  Now if only they'd TOUR here in the U.S.!
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the past 50 years -- stunning, dramatic, captivating, shocking, saddening, brutal and wonderful.  Never has a better cast been assembled, and never has a cast performed better.  Never has dialogue been so riveting.  The performances are like music, like songs you relish hearing again and again.  The realism is obvious to anyone who has ever worked in an office where profits are all that matter.  Watch this movie today, and again from time to time.  It is magnificent.<br />&quot;How can you present investment opportunities without television, without magazine ads?  I say, you take something this good, you go to a man has invested in the past, you go to him direct and offer the money to him:  REBATE!&quot;<br />The spiels just don't come much slicker than this, at the hands of the immortal Jack Lemmon.  P.S.  Put that coffee down.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Once you begin to listen to this CD, you immediately get sucked right into it.  Something about it just draws you deep into the core of the melodies, the lyrics, everything.  It literally sent shivers down my spine and made my mouth drop in fascination.  Each song is unique and leaves you with a different feeling.  It's ethereal, yet driving at the same time.  One of the most fascinating songs on the album is \\"Echelon\\", a five-minute long composition (it's too involved to just call a 'song') that mezmerizes you.  This band is phenomenal!  It's great to hear something original and so in-depth as this album.  If you like music that you can delve into and really LISTEN to, this album will keep your attention for months!
6300214370|5.0|This is another story of teenagers fighting the adult establishment and winning, though in the case of Footloose they skirted an anti-dancing law by moving their dance to another municipality.  Sarah Jessica was beautiful in this film, and she really should have stuck to acting (rather than voicing her opinions about anything in the real world).  Kevin and Chris were good, John Lithgow was terrific, and Lori was absolutely captivating.<br />One thing, though:  Dancing had been banned for several years in this town -- but when the kids finally arranged to have a dance, everyone knew exactly how to dance... and I don't mean the fox-trot.  These young folks were Olympic gymnasts, flipping around and break-dancing and hip-hopping to beat the band.  The only thing I can figure is that they secretly took lessons during all those years dancing was prohibited, smuggling in the necessary instructors and concealing all of the required conditioning exercises.  Well, he IS testing us!  Every, every day he is testing us!!
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is the album that should have come out years ago. . . It has all of the best songs from all of the Nirvana Albums.  It encompasses the defining moments of a ground-breaking band that helped pave the way for an entire era of modern music.  Kurt Cobain and Co. were on the forefront of what was to be the biggest thing in the first half of the 1990's: Grunge.  They lived it too. . . <br />The new song, \\"You Know You're Right,\\" is a great song, haunting as it is.  When you hear it, you know you won't hear from this specter from music's past ever again.  The irony is in Cobain's sarcastic wailing \\"things have never been so swell\\" just weeks before he died.  <br />\\"Nirvana\\" has all the hits. \\"About a Girl\\" is always a highlight.  This song, originally on Nirvana's debut, \\"Bleach\\" was made popular by its appearance on the \\"Unplugged\\" CD.  Songs that launched Nirvana in to the atmosphere are the contributions from the album \\"Nevermind.\\" \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" one of the definitive rock anthems of the 90's, is a must on any Nirvana compilation.  \\"Come As You Are,\\" \\"In Bloom,\\" and \\"Lithium\\" are all great songs, and huge radio hits off of \\"Nevermind.\\" Songs from the band's third release \\"Incesticide\\" were pretty cool.  I was a bit surprised that neither the \\"Nevermind,\\" nor the \\"Incesticide,\\" versions of \\"Polly\\" were included.  Some of the best songs on the record are from the band's fourth and final studio release \\"In Utero.\\" \\"Heart Shaped Box,\\" \\"Pennyroyal Tea,\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" are all great songs. Probably the most powerful track from \\"In Utero\\" was \\"Rape Me,\\" it is just great.  The David Bowie cover \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" is the only track on the album that was exclusively on the \\"Unplugged\\" CD.<br />This is just a great album for Nirvana fans and fringe fans alike.  It has most of the highlights of their career included.  The new song is a haunting reminder of what the sudden launch into superstardom can do to a person's mental condition.  It is a shamethat this band's life was cut so short.  I would have loved to have seen the direction the music would have taken with time. . . . <br />Get this CD, it is a must in any collection.<br />epc
B00003CXCW|5.0|Not without reason is this one of the greatest films of all time. Never before had anyone dared to expose the seedy, depressing underside of the Hollywood rat race and no one has come close since( with the possible exception of Robert Altman, whose film The Player makes for a great double feature). Billy Wilder's tale of a far too original for his own good, down on his luck screenwriter who finds shelter in the home and arms of a delusional, washed up silent movie queen is the kind of story Recyclewood(TM) could only dream of making these days. Everything about this film works. The dialogue is sharp, biting and often humorous. The players are all cast perfectly, whether it be Gloria Swanson's silent era goddess Norma Desmond, William Holden's disillusioned writer Joe Gillis or former silent era director Erich Von Stroheim's turn as Norma's ex-husband/butler Max. Even the bit players are brilliant. Including Cecil B. DeMille as himself and former Hollywood legends H.B. Warner, Buster Keaton and Anna Q. Nilsson as Norma's bridge cronies(aka \\"waxworks\\"). The cinematography is beautifully flawless, especially within the confines of Norma Desmond's cavernous home. And the directing, well, it's Billy Wilder and he could do no wrong. If you are thinking about a career in the glittering shark tank, this is as good a cautionary tale as you'll ever see.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This nirvana cd is a great addition to any Nirvana Fan's collection. It includes the best hits of nirvana and also the newest single from them (recorded right before Cobain's death) \\"You Know You're Right\\". It's a great song and really forshadows into Cobain's \\"suicide\\". This cd is a must have for any nirvana fan!<br />1. You Know You're Right (previously unreleased) - This is a TREMENDOUS song, and many nirvana fans will realize the hinting in here of Kurt Cobain's Suicide. Great song, excellent lyrics, and a groovy ending. Might get boring after a while. A-<BR>2. About A Girl - About a girl that he almost went out with in his teenage years. The song is meaningful, and expresses his sadness for the girl. Great song, and Cobain's voice is strong. A<BR>3. Been A Son - EXCELLENT LYRICS. A<BR>4. Sliver - It's ok. Good lyrics, but I think the rythem of the song, and other key aspects may be missing. B+<BR>5. Smells Like Teen Spirit - This song started nirvana's fame and fortune. While I don't like this song anymore, this song is probably one of Nirvana's best songs ever. It expresses his view of the world, with surprising lyrics, awesome addictivity, and a monster sound. A+<BR>6. Come As You Are - Great song with amazing rythm. The meaningful lyrics and the awesome bass strings earns this song a good grade. A<BR>7. Lithium - Yet, another song that expresses Cobain's life, and how he views the world. Overall, an excellent song. Editing the part in the song \\"Yeah, I don't have a god,\\" to \\"Yeah, I dont have a gun,\\" is ingenious. A<BR>8. In Bloom - Most likely my favorite song from Nirvana's Nevermind album. It discusses the troubles in living a poor and struggling life. Cobain suffered it every day. \\"Sell the kids for food, Weather changes mood,\\" and \\"He's the one who likes all the pretty songs And he likes to sing along And he likes to shoot his gun But he knows not what it means,\\" are excellent lyrics. And with some thought, you can really disect them to their true meaning <BR>9. Heart-Shaped Box - This is an excellent song. The lyrics are perfect, and the rythm is excellent, but after a while you get to see the real loopholes in the song. A-<BR>10. Pennyroyal Tea - The first song that really hinted Cobain's suicide. The lyrics are better than perfect, and the meaning of the song is overwhelmingly sad. Such a song deserves more credit than there is available in the world. A++ <BR>11. Rape Me - Great song that does NOT promote rape. Meaningful song. A-<BR>12. Dumb - The song is shrillingly sad. Cobain's smooth, soft, and sad singing really puts the effect on the song that it should have. This is a song about Cobain's highschool life. This song is just as perfect as Teen Spirit. Full credit. A+<BR>13. All Apologies - Another great song, similar to Penyroyal Tea. Same concept, but not as meaningful or as exciting. Gets boring after a while. A-<BR>14. The Man Who Sold The World - A cover of a David Bowie song. I cant rate this song on meaning since it isn't Cobain's writing, but I think Cobain adds a new demension to the somewhat boring version of Bowie's.<br />In all, GREAT CD and is for every Nirvana fan's collection.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This CD is one of the best rap compilations I have ever bought.  The shining tracks on the album are Lose Yourself (the newest Eminem song on the radio and the most meaningful), 8 Mile, Run Rabbit Run (a fast song that really gets you pumping), Love Me (which is a slow song that truly does Eminem's lyrics justice, how can you not love this song?), Rap Game (D12 sound great on this song and their rhymes are tight), 8 Miles and Running (it's Jay Z what else can I say), and a song by Boomkat called Wasting My Time (the song is beautiful and eerily haunting).  I think that anyone who is an Eminem fan should go out and get this album right away, if it's any indication of how the movie's going to be I can't wait.
B00003CXCS|4.0|I recently bought the Five Star Collection Edition of The Sound of Music, which has been one of my all time favorite movies since the 3rd grade, and was amazed. The film has NEVER looked so good or sounded so good. The commentary was excellent, and I love how it also presents the musical numbers WITHOUT vocals, so you can sing along. The extras on disc 2 were great too. I gave it 4 stars simply cause it seems there wasn't enough features, but what's on there is absolutely amazing. There's 2 documentaries, one from 1965 hosted by Charmaine Carr, who plays Leisl, and the 87 minute documentary that not only discusses the making of the movie, but the true life story of the Von Trapp family. There's the audio supplements, which have interviews with people who worked in and on the film. There's the gallery which is filled with photos and information. And the selection of trailers and TV spots, while probably incomplete, is still good. I just feel that they could have included some home video release TV spots, other re-release trailers, or what have you. But all in all, this DVD is good and the movie looks and sounds as good as ever in it's original 2.20:1 apect ratio, allowing you to see all of the incredible settings, including the on location filming. This DVD is worth every penny.

B00006LLNU|5.0|simply put this album is epic. it's as if someone took human emotion and somehow converted it into an audio format. this cd isn't for the casual listener though... it's just the most perfect music for late nights or long drives. jonsi's voice is pitched and shifted in ways that make him sound completely otherworldly... perhaps the only soon-upcoming cd release to beat this one is the new godspeed you black emperor (which i've heard and is... a step beyond mind blowing) it's all in what you want, this cd is simply pure beauty and godspeeds is more an exploration of human decay (but beautiful). this cd is a must own for anyone who enjoys good/impacting/beautiful music.

B00006CXXU|5.0|She's always said that there was more to her as a person and a vocalist and an artist than what we saw.  So it's no surprise that people are so surprised by the \\"sharp turn\\" that her first single conveyed (\\"Dirrty\\").  <BR>She serves some confections that shed all ties to teen pop, a genre that Ms. Aguilera has declined since her entrance.  More than that, Aguilera asserts herself as a strong artist as well as a vocalist by co-executive producing and writing all but two of the songs featured on this album.  With a wide breadth on the spectrum of producers, her artistic presence unifies a stylistically erratic album that is moving, believable and grooveworthy.<BR>The album opens with \\"Stripped Pt. 1,\\" a re-introduction to an artist we thought we knew, followed by \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" a hip-hop infused barb (featuring Lil' Kim) directed to men whose misogyny overtakes their senses, inspired by her own experiences with rumors and double-standards.  Christina cannot \\"Walk Away\\" from a love that doesn't love her the way that she needs in a soulful ballad but turns on the anger in the Dave Navarro guitar-featuring rocker, \\"Fighter.\\"  \\"Infatuation\\" and its preceding interlude are the stories of Christina's first love in Spanglish and flamenco rhythm while in the Mariah-like \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" tells a tale of a lover who adores her without pretense.  The blues-drenched, Alicia Keys compositon shares the \\"Impossible\\" story of a lover who won't share with the woman that he loves and the next song is about the way the Christina's boyfriend has made her feel funky, but \\"Underappreciated.\\"   \\"Make Over\\" is a Linda Perry co-production addresses Christina's disdain for being a pop puppet then she barrels into critics who disapproved of her style, then translating it into a univeralizing anthem of self-love in \\"Beautiful.\\"  Linda Perry co- produced/wrote the next three songs: \\"Beautiful,\\" an introspection of the critiques she received on her style which transforms into a universalizing, touch song, anthem of self-love and self-reliance; \\"Make Over\\" features Christina addressing her disdain for having been a pop puppet in a retro production; \\"Cruz\\" is a high-flying song expressing the emotional perils of leaving today to find a better tomorrow.  Transcendence of others' expectations to fulfilling one's desires for self, that is the message in \\"Soar\\" but \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is a neo-soul treatise to a lover who is having trepidation with their relationship status' nonextance.  \\"Dirrty\\" is the party anthem of any 21-year-old who wants to shake their ... with Redman and Rockwilder.  Then, \\"the Voice Within\\" is co- produced/written by Glen Ballard (of Alanis Morrisette, No Doubt fame) ballad that promotes self-assuredness over a fear of flight.  \\"I'm OK\\" is describes some of the traumas that Christina endured as the child of an abusive father in the form of a heartfelt and tear-jerking (she is literally crying on the track) ballad.  And \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\" is a celebration of Christina's survival.<BR>Wrought with themes of thriving beyond adversity, independence, being a woman, and love, Christina's album isn't teen pop anymore.  It's adult music for adult people by an adult with a lot to say and a gifted voice and an amazing capacity for articulation.

0312958455|4.0|Michael Connelly has dusted off an increasingly rare gemstone in the crown jewels of American literature: the hard-boiled detective. Present in Connelly's pithy and believable prose is all of the wit and grit of Hammett, MacDonald, Stout, and Spillane. What he's brought us in Harry Bosch is a cop's cop. Bosch, an LAPD homicide detective, is a real-life hero for whom the principled drive to see justice done allows him to deal with the treacherous world of Los Angeles politics and some even more treacherous politicians (some of whom masquerade as police officials). <br />While _The Last Coyote_ is the fourth Bosch novel, the plot and characters are so artfully developed that this novel could stand alone as a complete novel. At the same time, the writing is so compelling and captivating that it is a real pleasure to know that Bosch is a recurring character in Connelly's work. Although this is my first Connelly story, I am officially an addict, and I cannot wait to devour the rest of the titles in the Bosch series. <br />_The Last Coyote_ opens with Bosch under suspension for assaulting his Commanding Officer, Harvey \\"98\\" Pounds. With his newfound freedom comes a mandatory psychiatric evaluation to determine his fitness as a police officer. The ensuing therapy sessions force Bosch to take a hard look at his options, should he later be kicked off the force for the assault on his CO. <br />Faced with his ever-present personal demons, his suspension, and time on his hands, Bosch begins to investigate perhaps his greatest mystery: the unsolved 1961 murder of his call-girl mother. Though cautioned by his therapist that solving this mystery may remove his motivation to be a detective, Bosch dives into a mystery (and his personal story) that exposes the seedy underside of Los Angeles political corruption. The ride is taut, human, and utterly engrossing, and we are at once deeply satisfied and virtually winded when the dust settles. <br />My introduction to Harry Bosch was oneof those rare joys: a gifted writer spinning a fascinating tale with grace and skill. Perhaps equally enjoyable to me was the principled drive of the protagonist to get at the facts, despite the potential costs-to himself, his career, and his department. Bosch's belief that the truth shall set you free is more than a bromide. While freedom may not always bring redemption, it allows him to sleep at night.

B0000507R0|2.0|I was so looking forward to hearing this on my new toshiba 4800. What a letdown.Most of the material seemed to be different versions or outtakes of a quad soundtrack they did not release thirty years ago.Maybe DTS would have helped.After tweeking my system the disc improved somewhat,but..still all hype cant turn me on.

B00005AXEL|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that it is a major dissapointment to me that this album only when \\"gold\\" and was not the mega hit I was hoping for! However, this is not due to the music on this album, which I must say is amazing! The problem is that people haven't given Trouble In Shangri-La much of a chance, perhaps due to the disaster that was Street Angel, here are some reasons why you should:<br />1. Stevie sounds better than she has in years on these songs. Yes, her voice has changed, but it has changed for the better. It's every bit as expressive and emotional as before.<BR>2. The songs are excellent. Stand out tracks include the title track, Planets of the Universe, Sorcerer, It's Only Love, Bombay Sapphires, Fall from Grace, Too Far From Texas, and Love Is. The other tracks are excellent as well, but these are some of Stevie's best songs EVER.<BR>3. Even if you are not a Stevie fan, give this album a try. If you like good music that has substance and meaning you will like this I promise you. <BR>Trouble in Shangri-La has something for everyone, from country tunes to ballads to rockers, it is an impressive, stellar, and varied body of work. Buy it!
