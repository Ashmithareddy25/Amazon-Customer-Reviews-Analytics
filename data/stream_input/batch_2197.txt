B000ID37RM|5.0|Heart warming story. This is the story of a person who makes decision based  soley on his moral compass.  World would be better place if all of us lead life that way. A person of majority race stands with minority voice and tries to  protect a person of minority race. It is easy to profess but difficult to practice.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|The first 2/3 of this movie was intelligent and engaging.  Unfortunately the last 1/3 relied on tired Hollywood formulas in an attempt to build tension, and  it all devolved into a silly chase scene at the end.  Academy Award Winner - Best Picture????
B001LMAK88|4.0|This is something of a \\"paint by numbers\\" western. One senses the writer/director dutifully ticking off the conventions of the genre one by one. Barroom brawl, check. Free-range ranchers vs. farmers, check. Outlaw hideout in canyon, check. Wise and worldly female saloonkeeper, check. Oily gambler, goodhearted prostitute, check. Taciturn hero, check. Gunfights, check, check, check, check, check. Injuns, inexplicably MIA.<br /><br />It's not a bad approach to making a cowboy movie. Contrived, to be sure, and more than a little self-conscious, but those of us who esteem the genre expect certain elements, and if your favorite trope has not put in an appearance at any point in the flick, another quarter hour will likely summon it forth. Add to this some decent set design and cinematography, a handsome cast that appears to be enjoying itself and a workmanlike if not altogether memorable screenplay, and it's two hours well spent, although likely not among the first- or even second-tier of westerns I'll revisit. Among the cast members, craggy Scott Glenn acquits himself well as the aforementioned taciturn hero, as does Kevin Kline as the hero's diffident sidekick. Kevin Costner chews the scenery halfway across New Mexico to the Colorado state line, but he's having so much fun that his otherwise annoying performance compels our indulgence. Danny Glover hits all his marks as the Magical Negro (see tvtropes.org); Roseanna Arquette is briefly on camera as the Love Interest in a role so severely truncated that it probably ought to have been omitted altogether; John Cleese (!) shines in a small part as an honest, by-the-books sheriff who nevertheless maintains a realistic vision of his professional responsibilities, particularly where these involve his personal safety. It's the originality of this role as performed and written that nudged this review from three stars to four.<br /><br />The soundtrack by Bruce Broughton is unobjectionable as music, but is deployed in an almost intolerably heavy-handed fashion, and served throughout as an auditory irritant. I appreciate directors (John Sayles in \\"Lone Star\\" comes to mind) who do not feel the need to punch up the orchestra to convey drama, excitement, romance that ought properly be carried by the actors and the camera. Lawrence Kasdan has not learned this lesson.<br /><br />Summary: a pleasant western pastiche, ably performed and photographed. Not otherwise particularly memorable, and rather less than the sum of its tropes, but nevertheless a diverting evening's entertainment for fans of the western.tolerably heavy-handed fashion, and served throughout as an auditory irritant.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|I read a lot of sci-fi and not all of it is compelling enough to make me invest myself emotionally. Usually, sci-fi is great for societal and gubernatorial commentary, but I never find myself feeling the heartache of real people, just their hardships. That is not to say that this book is cathartic, because it's not. The emotions were realistic and sprinkled in, not shoved down your throat i.e., Twilight. I felt nervous, scared, enamored, and awed by this book. And it was not heavy-laden with so much tech jargon unique to this particular vision of the future, that I got lost. The only thing better than finishing this book is finding out that the story continues. READ THIS BOOK!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Highly reconmend. A lot of fun. Don't bug you to buy upgrades like otherr free apps. Def fun to have.

B000002G23|5.0|I had never owned any albums by The Police, except for the greatest hits collection [[asin:B000008JI6 Every Breath You Take]] (1986), which I bought on vinyl.  With “modern” music offering little of interest, as of late I have been filling in the gaps in my music collection, acquiring greatest hits collections from various artists from the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s.  In the case of The Police, Message In a Box-The Complete Recordings (1993) was the perfect solution for me, as the 4 CD set containing 78 tracks, apparent encompasses the band’s entire recording output, up to 1993.  This includes the albums [[asin:B00008BRBG Outlandos d’Amour]] (1978), [[asin:B00008BRDX Regatta de Blanc]] (1979), [[asin:B00008BRDV Zenyatta Mondatta]] (1980), [[asin:B00008BRDW Ghost In the Machine]] (1981), and [[asin:B00008BRB5 Synchronicity]] (1983), and various B-side songs associated with these albums, and assorted live tracks.<br /><br />The Police’s hit singles reflect a mere fraction of the band’s talents.  Although in the rock genre, the band’s music is a bit difficult to categorize, as members Sting, Andy Summers, and Stuart Copeland, explored various musical avenues during their time together.  I was a bit overwhelmed by the diversity of the songs, and very impressed by the band’s creativity.<br /><br />Experts have pointed out some omissions and minor shortcomings, but this collection is probably more than sufficient for the casual fan, with over four hours worth of music, which has been remastered for this set.  The included booklet is quite informative and colorful, and contains many great photos.  The Police subsequently remastered and reissued their catalog in 2003.  How these remastered versions compare to Message In A Box, I do not know.<br /><br />While $40 might be a lot for some, this collection is often available at very low prices used, and is ideal for those who want to experience The Police in one large megadose.  A five star rating is obvious, and well deserved.well deserved.
B009K0P10K|5.0|It's the first time I have been truly hooked on a program. Being able to go back 2 seasons and catch up is great. I am so on board with this show!!!

Living in suburbia and having grown up in farmland, I love that I can create summer evenings in my room in the middle of winter.

B005CRQ2XA|4.0|This is a Wimpy Kid Book that know one could forget. The sequel to Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book 1.
B000IZA9NK|2.0|Wasted efforts by Jude Law and Gweneth Paltrow.  Just a silly move.  Some special effects kept my interest.  Like the Hindenburg tying up to the Empire State Building, which it never did.  Thought the graphics were good.  This is just a silly, campy movie.  Glad I did not pay money to see this when it came out.  Don't even remember it coming out.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Very kid friendly.it can be linked to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.great but a little too addicting.good luck.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I chose The Language of Flowers because I love flowers, but I read it because it gripped my heart. The inner conflict of a tormented child broke my heart as she desperately tried to avoid being hurt by  hurting the one who sought to help her.  She retreated into the world of flower meaning to send a message which was only understood by a few.  Thank goodness for the few!

I bought the cd after hearing 3 songs and haven't turned it off since. I can't get enough. It's violin, it's hip hop, it's techno - it's wonderful!! If you dig, also check out Emily Wells :) Happy listening!

B00APJLFEG|5.0|The family liked this one though I had no idea Adam Sandler was in it until the credits ran.  Pretty good overall
B000VXLHWG|5.0|First off, hats off to the RCO for producing their own complete set of Mahler symphonies plus Das Lied and Totenfeier, recorded over a seventeen month period, utilizing nine different conductors. Each work occupies its own disc (dvd or bluray), and this review is for the bluray. You can buy this set (11 discs) for $86 inc. shipping from 'import cds' in California.(this is cheaper than Amazon) Compare this - less than $8 per disc - to the $36 per disc charged by the Accentus label through Amazon for barely 60\\" of music! Well done!<br /><br />Most of the reviews I've seen for this set seem to have been rushed out, and, because I have been guilty in the past of writing reviews after only one run-through, I have waited to do this one until I had listened to everything at least twice. Believe me - I grew fonder of several of these performances after a second audition. There's just too much in a Mahler symphony to assimilate critically in one sitting.<br /><br />There seems to have been a considerable problem for some people to make these discs play in their bluray unit. I bought mine from Amazon usa, and had zero issues. All the cues and menus worked properly. I just have a three year old Panasonic basic region 1 bluray player with no software upgrades. This is such a significant release that, had my player not handled the discs, I would have shelled out $70 for another player that worked (maybe trial and error until I found one). After all, I've saved a bundle by paying only $8 a disc. That would be at least $250 savings for the whole set compared with the conventional labels.<br /><br />Another complaint seems to be the lack of subtitles or even movement identification. I agree that this is unfortunate, but I would not be deterred by this omission. After all, what you're experiencing here are films of concert performances, and if you had attended the concerts, you wouldn't have gotten any visual aids there, either.I would have liked movement timings printed in the sleeves, though.<br /><br />The playing on all these discs by the RCO is beyond reproach. The sound is beautifully caught, although the stereo mode is much flatter and not nearly as dynamic and visceral as the DTS MASTER AUDIO. You really need good surround sound for this set to show off its best.<br /><br />The video is also excellent, always focusing on the particular instrument or section being highlighted at that point. The video is quite crisp except for symphonies #7 & 9, where a much more diffuse, softer focus is used. The lighting seems harsher, too. Looks to me like a different producer/director team was used for these two. Almost reminds me of aging news anchors on tv that were petrified of HD because of complexion \\"issues\\".<br /><br />Now to the individual performances:-<br /><br />#1)  Harding puts down a very good, at times idiomatic first, lots of portamento, conducting with no baton. Very good shots of the duelling timpani at the end. Very enjoyable performance.<br /><br />#2)  Jansons' Resurrection is not as manic as some, but I thought beautifully controlled and integrated. Some interpretations can lose their way - this one really works its way towards a glorious finale. Maybe could have used a little larger choir.<br /><br />#3)  Jansons again, again holding together a very long and episodic symphony. I prefer a swifter Langsam, but his speed fits the whole traversal of this engaging work<br /><br />#4)  Fischer( whom I really like as a conductor) takes a highly personal view of the exquisite fourth, and this is one of the real winners here. Absolutely captivating.<br /><br />#5)  Gatti is known for his individualistic Mahler readings, and this is no exception. He's very generous with his tempo variations, and when he launched into the Adagietto, I thought I was in for a 7-8 minute lovesong, as opposed to the usual 10-13 minute dirge. But he stops to smell the roses in the middle of it and ends up over 9 minutes! Pity! The finale is very exciting.<br /><br />#6)  Maazel, never one of my favorites in Mahler, actually holds this one together very well, giving equal weight to the strings as to the winds. A bit broad, maybe, but he keeps the momentum going, and the hammer blows will elevate you from your seat.<br /><br />#7)  I generally like Boulez' Mahler, especially #2, because all the instrumental parts can be discerned easily. The second Nachtmusik is taken faster than is usual, and is the better for it. Other than the video quality, very good version.<br /><br />#8)  Jansons again; this one I liked much better on the second hearing when I could concentrate on the singers. I never once found my attention flagging, which can sometimes happen for me in the Part 2. There are two other notable eighths available - Chailly and Dudamel. I find myself liking this one best.<br /><br />#9)  Haitink is to me a bland conductor - very stolid and predictable, and I am familiar with prior versions of his M9. Nothing much has changed - no playful lilt in the Landler, and a too drawn-out Adagio. Video quality very poor, as noted above.<br /><br />#10  I've owned the Inbal cd of the complete Cooke tenth for years, and it is a favorite. He does the famous upward glissando just before the end, unlike Rattle, for instance, who ignores it. Really involving performance - you'll definitely shed a tear or two in the last movement.<br /><br />Das Lied von der Erde and Totenfeier. Luisi has a way with Mahler - I love his #1 - and he swoops into Das Lied with a vengeance. A very exciting performance, helped enormously by the always wonderful Anna Larsson (dwarfing everybody else)and Robert Dean Smith. Both work without librettos. Totenfier is the apprentice work for symphony #2, first movement, and it is interesting to note  how the work grew up. I'd love to see a Luisi #2.<br /><br />None of these performances are less than very good and a few are excellent. This set is a great deal, and well worth finding a bluray machine to play it on.
B008P9M614|5.0|I just recently started watching House, and immediately got hooked. The writing is incredible.  Even though they follow a set story development line, you are still guessing with them what's wrong with the patient. Watching the character House come up with the solution is always fun. Hugh Laurie is a brilliant actor. His characterization of Gregory House has been created down to the use of his clear, blue eyes to express what is going on. The writers gave us what we wanted in his relationship with Cuddy, yet didn't forget about the other people on the &#34;team&#34;. Making House the disgruntled doctor and saying what he's actually thinking, vs being tactful is what started us to watch this series.  Now that we have the entire series on DVD, the story lines that continue are exciting and interesting. I can't watch just one episode at a time. I do laugh at some of their surgery techniques. Taking out an appendix from the left side of the body or removing a spleen from the right side of the body is not proper.  I thought the Doctors who were the consultants were there to correct these mistakes, but they don't detract from the story.
B0086700CM|1.0|I HATE THIS APP it causes ur devise to crash and all it is is running so u get burned out after like two runs. minecraft is better
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Extremely good. Also followed with the narration which was also great.  I think many people can relate to this book because we've all been children or teenagers and sometimes not how pat is feeling. He has a child like quality to him which is refreshing but also kind of sad.  I loved this book.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I read dog days. I liked it, but in my mind, there r some parts that I like.The movie was much better. You`'ll see when u see the movie dog days
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game.  The graphics were great and finding the objects was challenging without being impossible.  The puzzles were also a challenge but could be solved using the clues found while playing the game.  I will definitely purchase more games like this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|On a kindle, the game doesn't freeze. It's also a lot easier to play than on the iPod. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Enjoyed it and glad it made it to the big screen.  It is a piece of history - everyone should watch it at least once.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Of course we do not know what REALLY is, but as a Christian, I have an open mind on whats out there.  There is no question that Jesus came to save us through our Heavenly Father, but all the &#34;realms&#34; and descriptions are amazing!! Endless possibilities that Our Lord has in store for us!!

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|the oc keeps you coming back for more in the first season and its doubled in season 2. more drama, more comedy, more cohen, and SOOOOOO many twists and turns. i love everything about this season and the surprises that come. if you love this show you should already own this. its by far the best of the 4 seasons and definitely deserves your money.<br /><br />buy it
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is okay and was recommended to me by a coworker.  It is challenging but not exactly what I wouild like to keep playing.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|such an excellent retelling of evangelion. the story is being redone and the animation has never looked better. frame for frame, most of the series has been recreated with present day technology. whiny shinji is back and the action has never been this good. everything you love is here and more. a great price for a great story and character.<br /><br />buy this because you need it
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This an easy game to play and sort of interesting.  This would be a great game for younger kids that are getting into things of this nature and I would recommend it.
1401216676|5.0|it may be short, but man this is one heck of a read. $10 is a killer price for the content here. the horrid acts committed by the joker are horrifying and its worth it up to the very end. if youre a batman fan you should already own this. if you arent, you still should already own this. one of the best graphic novels ever.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This a challenging game of solitaire.  Boggles the mind once in a while and I would recommend this if you like solitaire
B004WPYNY8|5.0|i love symphony x and ive been listening to them since V and up until paradise lost i didnt think theyre material could get any better!!! but man they just keep pushing out the best kind of sound. the technicality and furious riffs are so body filling. Bastards of the Machine is by far the most killer track on the album. Reign in Madness is another song that just doesnt let off. the insane amount of key and time changes make it one heck of a song. Any fan who has been faithful to the symphony x sound has no reason not to pick this up.<br /><br />instabuy
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway suffers:) its great. It kind of glitches sometimes and takes a little while to load, but its really fun! I'm addicted...
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|what a fantastic retelling of evangelion. this was a great price and the content was exceptional. i loved everything about this and animation. oh my god, what a job theyve done with redoing every cell down to the t. theres going to be 4 movies total and its worth buying this to see it unfold.<br /><br />purchase this awesome blu ray
B00333NCTM|5.0|i have to say it was very refreshing to read an autobiography and it be not only brutally honest but also extremely funny.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The Lorax movie was perfect! It was very easy to but the instant video! I would reccommend it to others!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Got this app for free. I was very happy because I was looking for a word document app. Then after some months this app got the new update. So I'm like oh yay. But then I couldn't find out how to change the background on the power point presentation thing. Also I liked the past format that the app was in. It was easy to do stuff in it. So until you change that or just make stuff easier I am going to rate this 3 stars. Sorry guys.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Plots were great.  Enjoyed every episode.  Good dynamics between Holmes and Watson.  Familiar villains with refreshing perspectives.  Thought Moriarty was a little over the top, but effective.  Well done!  Heartily recommended.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Outstanding British drama and characters - keeps you &#34;tuned in&#34;, can't wait for next season, although disappointed that some are not returning.
1616550414|5.0|This book is a great investment for any Zelda fan, but especially if you're new to the series. About the first third of the book is dedicated specifically to Skyward Sword, the newest installment in the Legend of Zelda series at the time of the book's release. Following that is another approximate third for the Official Timeline, going into detail on each game in order, as well as an overall timeline which has three branches. Beyond that, the remainder of the book contains artwork from various Zelda games, so you can see in detail the evolution of characters like Link and Zelda, as well as various images other characters (though not as many). There's also an excellent amount of concept art which is really interesting. At the tail end of the book is a short manga style comic telling the story of Link and his Loftwing from Skyward Sword.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that it focuses so much on Skyward Sword. If only it could dedicate as much space to each game... The book is already pretty huge as is, though, so that would be impossible!<br /><br />tl;dr If you are a Zelda fan and haven't purchased this book yet, do so immediately.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|I think that this game is super good! I think everyone will like this game. I hope everybody will rate this game 5 stars.
B009YQJ322|4.0|Better than I thought. Great action. I would reccommend this movie for action fans. It is worth the purchase price.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I like it. If you people really hated pornography that much, then you should have gotten the ad free version. This game is boss and since you didn't get the ad free version, that's your loss.
0792165020|2.0|Disc is quite scratched up and dirty. I have not watched it as I have promised my sister to watch the ending together when I return home (I bought this because we missed the ending of the movie when we watched most of it together in Vegas). I sure hope the movie can be played.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Fun to do multiplayer with kids! It's less confusing than full computer game and cost less, all in all a good buy
0062209493|5.0|This is a great book written by a great man. a true American hero. This gives the normal person such as myself a little insight to what a sniper goes through going to war and when they get home. Highly recomened this book/audio book. I own both and they were well worth the money.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Be warned this is not just another zombie show! The characters are fully engaging! I had read most of the comic books and this version of the story fits well in The Walking Dead universe. Shot in the south to add to the flavor,  the sweat and dirt adds perfect flavor to the post apocolyptic world built here. Watch from the beginning as this story builds richly. There is a companion show Talking Dead,  available online and once you are addict you will want to watch as well. Watch all the extra clips they are worth it
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|I bought it 3 days ago and it was working fine until the screws were coming off.<br />the bolt where you tighten the camera mount plate grinned off
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I'm a sucker for good stories involving swords and such. This story is told well on the screen. I had not read the books so I can't attest to how close it stands to the story line but I have enjoyed each episode. Gritty and engaging the story telling feels authentic. I'm an old D & D player, The Elder Scrolls are on my game shelf too, this show will end up proudly on my shelf to impress my other geek friends.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Awesome book...love Nichole's Sparks!!  Easy read and pulls u in...would definitely recommend reading. Couldn't put it down. Thanks for another sweet story.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Well worth the wait! Great upbeat return to some of their earlier sound. I do enjoy Billy's rock operas but sometimes just want to tap my foot and bob my head, it's especially good when there are some intelligent lyrics along the way. I immediately got Dos! and Tre! After downloading this
B001BR7CZW|5.0|This movie has been out so long I figure that anyone familiar with blues music, SNL history, etc. has an opinion.  Personally, the music alone makes this movie worthwhile.  For those not that interested in the musical landmarks, it is still a good story.  My perspective is that Aykroyd, Belushi, and the rest of the original crew represented the pinnacle for SNL.  The movie reflects the ability to take the absurd and make it a tenable good time.
0451232852|5.0|also read the next book in the trilogy, Winter of the World and can't wait for the third book which is expected in 2014
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I decided to read this book after I found out he had passed away.<br />Excellent book and easy to read.  Yes, I would recomment this book to anyone interested in this subject.

B009VA1FN6|5.0|I loved this book, Kate Morton draws you in with her style of writing, laying down family plots with fantastic details, you can just picture the scene.  I can honestly say this is the best book I have read in ages.  Highly recommend (I will definitely read more of Kate Morton's books).  Totally enjoyable to the last page.  If you want a good holiday read, this is it.

B007MJKOY4|5.0|I think I enjoyed the movie more than my husband who likes more action, but I thought it was well done.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Slightly diferent approach from Mr Grisham but still a great read as he drags the reader into a complex web of threat and plot written this time from the convicts point of view butit is the lawyer who is the convict. All highly complicated and at times maybe a little far fetched but involving and compelling.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed the movie  and we are both looking forward to the next installment.  I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a great job!!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like to put puzzles together as they are challenging.  There are a number of puzzles and a number of different designs to work with.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this book a bit annoying... I finished reading it because I wanted to know what would happen, and because it came so hightly recommended but I found the characters very annoying.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Session 3 is so far the best session so far. Intense , Gory, and what a Story Line.<br />Can't wait to see what the rest of the session brings. If this session is the best how are they going to top this with Session 4 Has to be More Intense More Gory and please kill the Governor I can't stand him.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Gorgeous graphics on my Galaxy S2, and perfect gameplay. Just enough hints to keep things flowing so you're never frustrated! Loved the music score too. :-)
B006G7R25W|5.0|watched with family. children enjoyed it. brought back old memories of my childhood days watching this with my family then.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|I really enjoyed part one of the dark knight returnes and this one did not dissapoint.Even if you are not a batman fan I feel like you would enjoy this movie for the underlying story line.We are all getting older and eventually we will reach an age where we are not going to be phtsically able to do what we want.We can all relate to this at some point and time in our lives,sooner or later.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|and that's what I was looking for.  There are a lot of games included so it will provide a lot of hours of play.  It you enjoy Sudoku, then you'll like this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have watched this show since the begining and am hooked by it.Some may look at it as purley as a zombie show,but it's deeper then that.You have great stories about the characters and how they interact with one and other under the circumstances.Don't be fooled by the gore of this show,you will fall in love with this show too!
B000IJ79UW|5.0|The original is still the best. The entire cast adds a significant value to this classic film. The action, emotion and storyline still entertains me after all these years. What is especially good are the extras included in this package. I enjoyed and found each to be interesting as well as entertaining and actually helped make the original movies even more enjoyable! I am very happy with this purchase.
B000VHMF0A|4.0|Bob Marley is a Legend (lame pun most certainly intended). To be honest, I bought this for two songs: &#34;Three Little Birds&#34; and &#34;No Woman No Cry,&#34; but after listening to each track thoroughly, it's easy to see how great each song is by its own merit. I won't claim to be a huge fan of the genre, but I also cannot say that I dislike it. It's my belief that anyone could listen to &#34;Legend&#34; and keep a place for it in their heart as a listener.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|A truly great source of topical articles well written with a straight forward delivery. There's a variety of solid and fluff articles to choose. Treat yourself to this often imitated but never quite capturing the complete package that Flipboard has to offer.
B00785P2QC|3.0|thisnapplication is okay for those of us who like the Sim city game but dont have it on our tablets. I would like more control over how and when I can build things but its a nice distraction when I need to let off some steam
B00633W614|4.0|This second installment was good but not as good as the first book in the series.  I look forward to the 3rd one coming out soon.  Hope it is as good as the first book.
0722532938|5.0|This is my second read through this book, it is quite thought provoking and inspiring. This is a classic book at a very reasonable price, and well suited for most generations (espeically high school and college years who are well on their course of pursuing their dreams).
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good writer. Good plot. Good characters. Fun read. What's not to like? Action, suspense, adventure, a little bit of romance, a touch of history, a bunch of patriotism. Nice mix.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the new update, a lot of games were the same from start to finish, not this one. It changes all the time.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I stand by my first review,sorry I ever revised my opinion. Everyone should get their refund!! Why should we buy a book that should for less when she pub for herself, and now pay a lot more now!! I will Never Buy Her Books!!!  If she deletes this I will just rewrite it again, as I do when author delete my negative reviews!!! I Will Be Watching My Reviews!!!
1616550414|4.0|It's a great book and all...but the issue lies in that a big chunk of the book is Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess while the &#34;Best&#34; of the series (everyone's favorites being OoT, MM, and WW) only get a few pages before being completely buried by Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess stuff.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I who know nothing about games watched three of my grand kids have fun and be happy.....Thank you amazon good game
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Pretty outstanding lego set. Took over 8 hours to construct, but was probably the most fun i have had building a lego set in a long time. When fully constructed it's a true showpiece!<br /><br />The only less then outstanding qualities of this set are the bottom of the ship, and the overall slightly lower detail. The original UCS Star Destroyer had some pretty good detail because of it's scale, but if this were to be made to the same scale it would be 15 feet long, so the detail isn't quite as good. The bottom of the ship is especially guilty of this, as other reviewers have mentioned, and has almost no detail at all (it's totally flat!)<br /><br />Aside from that, if you are looking for an eye-catcher, or that massive showpiece, or have an extra 8-11 hours of free time that you need to fill with lots of lego and/or money, then this UCS is for you!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Head phones jack is kind of a pain. But the case does exactly what it says. Very vey good quality.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game.  it gives you the opportunity to build your own city.  it is good for any age or ability.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much. It's so much fun! If you are horse lover you will love this game.
B008YI91HS|3.0|I am very glad that i was able to get this movie, but I do not like the fact that I cannot add this ti iTunes.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Terible story line, poor acting, laughable plot, surprised that its a Quentin Tarantino film, Not worth the price of a 2 day purchase.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Setting galore, the best of which are the math problems you can set to snooze or turn off the alarm and the progressively shorter snooze times. If you are a perpetual snoozer like me, this alarm clock is the perfect solution.
B00979CS50|5.0|This album is a great record.  I have seen him 2 - times and he was so much better with them than his electric band in 2009. It shows on this record he is on another level.<br /><br />He is electric with them and the power is awesome, his voice is strong on these songs and guitar work is classic Neil.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I avoided this book for years because my dad had a stroke and was paralized for 8 years before dying when he was 75. But this book is very uplifting. It also teaches the layman a lot about brains. Not only do you learn about her amazing recovery but you learn about your own brain as well.<br /><br />When she describes the bliss she felt when her right brain was the ONLY viable brain running the show, it helps you understand what each brain half contributes. She talks about the plasticity and recovery power of the brain - and contrasts it to what parts of the brain (in the limbic region) don't change over time. It helps you understand you old triggers and that you can't really CHANGE Them... at best you can bring awareness to them... and hope to have other parts of your brain help you choose a different reaction... at best :)<br /><br />ANyhow... this book is SOOOOO good that I am stopping reading it because I want it to last. I am SURE I will read it again. I am also listening to it. That is even better. It is so great to hear her story in her own voice.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|This album is not as good as Psychedelic pill but a tune up for a great record. Recorded fast and raw it captures the power of crazy horse. I have seen him 2 - times and he was so much better with them than his electric band in 2009. It shows on this record he is on another level with them Strange song choices ,some work some do not but always interesting.<br /><br />He is electric with them and the power is awesome, his voice is strong on these songs and guitar work is good.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Amazing! One word that describes this game. Its an old game that has come back with a lot to follow!!!!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Love love love love love this movie. And getting all three in one set is the way to go. Awesome!
0451205766|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I had seen the film at least five times before I read the book. I found the book to be just as great as the movie is and I consider the movie top 5 of all- time. As others have pointed out, the side stories of Lucy Mancini and Johnny Fontane (Personally, I found Fontane's chapters to be quite entertaining) may have detracted from the overall greatness of the novel. However, I don't think they hindered the book so much as to take away a whole star from my rating.<br /><br />I thought while the movie captured Michael's exile in Sicily much better than the book, the book did a better job of telling us the back-story of characters like Luca Brasi, Peter Clemenza and Albert Neri. I also felt we get to go into the mind of Michael Corleone more so in the book. Mario Puzo may not be a \\"great\\" writer but this isn't meant to be high end literature, it is purely a novel meant to sell a lot of copies and highly succeeds in its execution.<br /><br />As someone who is half Sicilian, I found it almost compulsory for me to read the book; But you don't have to be any part Sicilian or even Italian to enjoy this novel. I highly recommend it.
0741470314|5.0|I just finished reading this wonderful book, Defending A King~His Life and Legacy. And, let me tell you, the minute I opened to the first page, I could barely put it down. As a huge fan of Michael Jackson, for my entire life, it was refreshing, to finally, have a positive, and loving story, about this man, who was so misunderstood and never given a break. Although, there were many details in the book, that I did know, I also learned many new things about the man and his life. Truths. Truthful accounts. Not hearsay, not lies, not made up stories, to demoralize this man. If you love Mchael Jackson, I recomend, reading this book, if for no other reason, then to fall in love with him all over again. And, to honor, the real memory of this beautiful humanitarian, who never got the recognition he deserved in life. If you are not a fan, you will become one after reading this book. If you loved his music, but never took the time, to know who Michael Jackson truly was, this is the book for you. It's time, the public, learned the truth about his life, and the real human being he was. And, why he will forever be a legend, who is deeply loved, and, missed by so many. This is the book, to learn not what the tabloids reported. Not what the media, exploited, just for their own gain. Not what so many used to destroy this man. No, this is the book to tell it like it was, and put Michael Jackson, in the right place in history. At the top, with his dignity in tact. I LOVED this book, and I am so happy I read it. It made my heart smile, knowing that someone took the time to love Michael this much, and share that love and faith of the man with the world.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|An interesting read but getting used to the Irish vernacular was a bit of a challenge.  Found some of the story dated but good insight on life in an orphange.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Even though the movie has been made many times over, who wouldn't love to read the very original.  The original is better to read than to watch.  There are always scenes in a book that are not put into movies.  Recommended.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I'm not much of a suspense reader, but after reading this book I was hooked!  It has it all, murder, revenge, love, sex the guilty pleasure kind, lies, betrayl, and a lot of crazy stuff in between.  I loved how she started the book.  It definitely caught my attention.  Her going back and forth between past and present got confusing at first, but after getting into the book it just made sense.  She's very creative and I could definitely see where her job played a big role in the book.  I'm a fan and I can't wait to read her next book.
B004UCQNAK|5.0|The Spanish dubbing of the movie is excellent. The translation retained the poetry and intonation of the language, even in the songs. Truly a remarkable job.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|The image is really clear... And the colors of the movie are brighter. Nice movie..... I really recommend this movie.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|This app is NOT USER FRIENDLY from my point of view. I could be wrong.<br /><br />I have removed it from my iPhone.  Don't Waste your time on it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love my new horse. This game is is a must have for people with no lives like myself lol why is there a word minimum? I have nothing else to say...lol hi
030758836X|1.0|I guess insanity pays. She definitely won. I kept hoping to see her get her just reward and what a waste. Do not recommend to anyone.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|Thanks!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The black case is stylish and protects your Kindle nicely.  The strap works great at holding the cover to the back when in use.  I would enjoy an added and strap to use when reading.  The leather is difficult to hold on a moving train.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Thanks!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what I need! Did not have one on my kindle so this is what I chose. What else can really be said.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing the game....I got started after watching my son play.  We play together now...always. He loves the geography while playing.  I love how it seems like the pace of the game keeps changing.  My son can not get enough of the different types of boards to choose from...wish some of them were more financially accessible(cheaper).
6304806418|5.0|Thanks!
B008220DGE|1.0|What a vulgar excuse for a movie. I'm not offended. It would take more than the so called artists of the film industry to pull that off. I'm insulted. I think that I'm in a growing majority of film goers who are really getting fed up with unnecessary scenes of stupid sex and violence.The way the film ended was unsatisfying . Unresolved endings and films that just seem to stop are all too common nowadays. This lack of imagination abounds in the writing of this movie.  There are plenty of smart films out there. This is not one of them. Don't waste your money. I tossed this one where it belonged, in the trash.
B003TT2X72|5.0|Thanks!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This well-written fantasy genre book drew me in from the first page.  I am looking forward to continuing the series.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Thanks!
B00A85EMVK|2.0|I like Top Gun as a movie. A good balance of action, comedy, personal interactions.  So my rating is not based on the movie itself - you either like Top Gun or not.  My comments are about technical issues only - namely 3-D conversion. Briefly, not impressed.  Very poor conversion in my opinion.  There were a couple of good 3-D effects in some flying sequences but just a couple.  Definitely not the quality of Avatar, most cartoons, and a multitude of others (I own about 40 3-D titles).  I see no benefit to this conversion and advise not to buy it if you already have a good DVD or Blu-Ray copy.  You will not gain anything.  This is the first 3-D movie I can honestly say that if Amazon would let me return it even though I watched it I would have it back in the mail immediately with priority return shipping.
B00005JM02|5.0|Thanks!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i love everything about this show, the whole zombie thing is hard to pull off these days but this show does it brilliantly
B000AY74OG|5.0|Thanks!
0740797719|5.0|I am a photographer, retoucher and digital artist, and I find this book extremely helpful for any visual artist. We all need to be able to render believable light and shadow and choose right colors no matter what medium we're using, and James Gurney is amazing at seeing light and color and explaining it to those who'd like to learn. Highly recommended!
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Thanks!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The first Angry Bird game with better graphics. I loved it when I played it but never got to the end. Angry Birds became corny by then.
1592407889|5.0|Between mother and daughter...someone is lying...I would bet that it is Shirley that had exaggerated the truth for years....in the same way that her acting can be exaggerated in many of her roles
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|I downloaded it on my phone and while it was fun, i think it would have been better if i Played it on a tablet.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Good book<br /><br />I liked it. Shouldn't be a cliff hanger at the end. I have to type a few more words.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|It was a fun game like most in the Angry Birds series. Glad they upgrade and went to Star Wars .
075666733X|1.0|This book has a major flaw in that it does not once describe/ depict an intact penis. All mammals are born with a foreskin. 70 to 90 % of the world's men HAVE their foreskin. Only in America are newborns still often routinely circumcised, although the circumcision rate has dropped dramatically from a high of 90% in the 1970's to as low as 32% now.<br /><br />The book fails to provide any information at all about the penile foreskin, the functions, the highly specialized nerve endings like the rigid band and the meissner's corpuscles, the special antibodies contained therein which actually help stave off infection, including protection from HIV/ AIDS, and so forth. You can learn more by searching \\"functions of the foreskin\\" and see for yourself.<br /><br />I cannot believe an MD actually wrote this! A great disappointment.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I don't know why I downloaded this app. Used it for .45 seconds and then forgot about it. I hope this review helps you avoid it.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Great movie, goes perfect with all the others in the series. Never get sick of them, worth watching over and over.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Keep the partying going with Angry Birds...I don't know what else to say about the game except 'kawww!' Oh, I need two more words.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Not only does Ted have the voice of Peter Griffin, which is considerably distracting, but Seth McFarlane is SERIOUSLY reaching with this plot line.  It seems like a sketch idea that goes on 2 hours longer than it should have.  It's unfortunate, because the movie is filled with hilarious people.  Love Seth, love Joel McHale, love Mark Wahlberg, HATE this movie.  Thank you, I can never get those hours of my life back and i'm even upset about the $4 bucks I'm out as a result of renting this &#34;film&#34;.  Gross.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I rarely used this program, but when I did, oh boy! It was amazing in opening up documents. That's about it.
B006VSP906|5.0|Incredibly told story, moving yet containing the characteristic humour that is quintessentially Hitch. A worthy read and invaluable to any lover of Hitch's writing .
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|I think I might have deleted it. But I downloaded it such a long time ago it might have improved.
B008476HBM|5.0|Miss Austen is the most dear friend! Oh how we laugh and conspire together! She has given me Mr Darcy, whom all young ladies should have, and she has shown me myself, whom I know better from her dearest Lizzie.
B004J1DBJI|1.0|That's what you'll do when you realize this app serves no real purpose. I don't know why I downloaded it. Maybe a girl told me too.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Very disappointed in product. Does not work with my computer. Downloaded prog like instructed. Found out too late to return it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Favorite app for sure. When it first came out, I used to play it all the time. Today not so much, but it's a popular game for a very good reason.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I downloaded this book onto my kindle...intending to read it on a road trip out west.  I made the mistake of starting it before we left...and damned if I didn't finish it before the trip began...It is another page turner...with a fast start and it keeps going and going...
B004ZH66XO|4.0|It kept me entertained for a long period of time. It does wear off after a while but I would still recommend the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book it's very nice when done reading the book I told my mom we should watch the movie she said sure why not and we loved I hope they make a second movie for the second book
B004TTZHBK|3.0|I planned on using this app to learn how to make more dishes for dinner...never learned a damn thing. No fault of the app, just my lazy self.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Excellent quality on all levels - the DVD quality, the quality of the story, settings and actors. Would highly recommend.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|This game right here??? Love it. Fun, high replay value, and just fun. I wish they expanded on the game and added other levels. Maybe they have but I haven't touched it in about 6 months since I got my iPhone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not your usual good guy- bad guy book. it was well written and certainly gave the reader a 360 degree look at both Nick & Amy.  The ending left me saying &#34;what the&#34; . A lot of twists to this story.<br />If you love crime books this story will give you a fresh take.......really enjoyed this one.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|The game is fun but by the time I downloaded it, it was old to everyone, so I didn't play it during it's prime. Still a cool game.
B0095P31L6|1.0|This show was boring and not entertaining at all. Even my 8yr old twins requested that I turn it off.<br />So there is my review and I hope I got 20 words
B005LY4B0A|3.0|It was a fun game, very challenging, but then it got to a point where it was too challenging and not enough reward. So I stopped playing it. I think I liked it for about 2 weeks, which is very long for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I can't even put the game down for hours. GREAT GAMING IDEA ON THEIR PART. LOVE THIS GAME &amp; gaming company.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|It works great, finds the songs you need and is only second to Soundhound because you can't really hum songs into it.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|All good, great to watch in order. Fun to watch this program on a raining or snowy afternoon with your family.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|It's adobe reader and it's here to help you read those pdfs. Are there any better products out there? I don't know because I'm a brand monkey. All hail Adobe.

0316228532|5.0|My friend loaned me this book with the caveat that she didn't like it and couldn't finish it. So I wasn't expecting much. But I was so wrong! I am a JK Rowling fan and have loved all the HP books. I'm also closer to JK's age than the YA audience of the HP world. So that's my perspective. I was just so happy to finally be reading a book written by JK Rowling again. I realized in reading this book that I love her writing style. She does such an excellent job at developing the characters and the story in very subtle ways. There were a lot of characters, and I found myself getting a little confused at the beginning, but that is not unusual. It happens with a lot of books, especially the really good ones. The book draws you in and gets you invested in these characters, despite the fact that none of them are very likable. That was actually what I found most surprising about this book. You have this cast of characters that all are either terrible people or woefully flawed, and you still are rooting for them and want to keep reading to see what is going to happen. I didn't want the book to end. It's one of those books that could just keep going and going, since it's not really about very much to begin with. And that is a testament to JK Rowling's writing style that I could enjoy reading a book about nothing, more than a badly written book that actually has a more \\"identifiable\\" plot. I can't wait for her to write more!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Pros:  Colorful.<br />Cons:  It rather bored me after three or four times.  There isn't anything new or different from game to game - nothing to hold my attention.  Now, there are other games that are similarly the same, over and over again but, this one just bored me.  Sorry but, I have better things to do with my time.
1594744769|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It had been on my \\"to read\\" list for a while. When I finally sat down to read it, I wasn't disappointed. The juxtaposition of the pictures into the story is fascinating, all the more so when you read at the end that each picture is real and wasn't just taken to enhance the story. I don't want to give anything away in the review (even though others probably have, since this isn't a new book), but suffice to say the story is sufficiently interesting and intriguing. Could it have been better, sure. Could it all have been explained in a bit more detail, yes. But I enjoyed reading it, and it was a quick read. Looking forward to a sequel!!!!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is an excellent movie that demonstrates how politics distort an excellent act.  One's personal life should not be used to diminish superior accomplishments unless that personal life had a detrimental effect on performance.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|here you have the best of both worlds, carol king tapistry  in top 50 albums of all time and what can you say about james taylor that has nt been said. both together and you can t help but smile, close ur eyes and heaven  can t get any better than that
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is even more entertaining than the first. I love that it now has twists in the path. Took a few runs to get used to the new stiff though.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Without giving away the added scenes they are a MUST for any Twilight lover!!!!... They are not really extended scenes but new scenes added in.  There is not longer version of the wolves running or such but whole new scenes that blend well with the movie. I think they should have been in the original cut.  Allot of films add in extra scenes that quite don't add to the film or slow it down but these added scenes for Part 1 really give the movie added punch!  I just loved watching the bonus scenes. It was also fun not knowing where they will show up so it almost like watching a new movie!...  Get this you won't regret it.<br /><br />I did get my copy on ebay where they had The Twilight Saga Complete Collection Box Set. It has all 5 movies on blu ray plus digital copies of all of them. Also it includes the audio commentary as an option!  And.... It has the Extended Edition of Breaking Dawn Part 1.....<br /><br />The Digital copies on the 5 Movie Box Set are on Cinema Now which is a great free app for storing movies where you can watch them on any device without taking up GB space on your device. They also download. At first I didn't think I would like Cinema Now compared to iTunes but then I saw my Blu Ray player had the option and I can watch my movies at a press of a button from Cinema Now. Its also available on SmartTvs. So it cool to have all the digital copies! I thought this was the best deal out there.
B008BC1YG8|2.0|Tom Cruise is fantastic, as usual. Jamie Foxx is good - not his best. Jada Pinkett Smith's character seems to be entirely unnecessary. The plot felt contrived and hesitant, jumping from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx's characters to detectives. An interplay between Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith made me mute it, it was so persistent and obnoxious. So what was the overall point? I wasn't entertained, educated, or shocked.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I don't play the games for my kindle; my grandkids do. I'm unable to figure out how to change the language back to English & not satisfied with no directions. I can't even identify WHAT the language is!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|NIcholas Sparks has written another great book.. I love the actors who are portraying the characters in the movie.  Julianne and Josh.  Great castings.  I love the book so much I couldn't put it down.  I gave this a 5 star rating.  If I could I'd give it a ten star rating.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was such an amazing story. The history that goes with the story is almost unbelievable. I looked up the real story on the internet as the dog is incredible.  So glad I bought this movie, Richard Gere is a favorite of mine, they did a fantastic job of following the true story.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I needed more plot and character development.  I thought it was overrated.  The plot was too simple and somewhat predictable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun and it is so addicting! I could play this game all day long! I love how you can get upgrades and stuff!!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game overflows with so much fun that I forgot I was running a bath.  I heard another person forgot he was waiting at a bus stop... I would like to say that somebody else forgot to see the forest because of the Trese (but that's not how you pronounce the developers' name).<br /><br />The game mechanics are simple and it is easy to get started.  You can play as a combat-oriented or non-combat oriented captain.  As you improve you can complete challenges for unlocks.<br /><br />Each time you play the game it is slightly different: sometimes you cannot find an officer or a ship you want, sometimes there is a dearth of contracts.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful. Such a well done series. From the start it keeps your interest. One wants the show to continue forever.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Great movie, clearly shows the complex relationship between the master of suspense and his wife Alma. An honest interesting love story.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Very annoyed to find that the final episode was not included in this package!  And I waited WEEKS to get the first 2 seasons and they were incomplete as well!  Just tell me for pity's sake!  I would have bought more tapes.  How hard is it to provide complete information?

B0046ECFRM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would. This was my first YA read and definitely won't be my last.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I think this book deserves 5 stars because it's amazing. I finished this book in 2 weeks it was so good. I didn't see a lot of things coming as I read. It was too great. There was nothing I disliked about this book. Everything was incredible. I can't wait to read the other Mortal Instruments books, or watch the City of Bones movie. Cassandra Clare is my favorite author.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|That was one addicting book! Lots of twists and turns I wasn't expecting. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quick captivating read.
0307346617|3.0|This books is very well written. The idea behind it, the style of the narrative, are fairly unique in the seething mass of zombie novels. It consists of many first person accounts of their version of the zombie apocalypse (known as WWZ)<br />I could not get into it at all. I am too much a lover of character development, relationships etc. This is a whole differnt style. I knew that going in, figured it couldn't hurt to try.<br /><br />Like I said, a well written book - just not &#34;me&#34; !

This book is the one you will wear out the ink on from reading and re reading.<br /><br />So much guidance and explanation of how it works and why. Support systems, facts, debunked myths..<br /><br />I would not leave home without this book. Its my constant companion.<br />cjaqui
B0095P31L6|3.0|The ease of choosing a movie with a Prime subscription was awesome!!  Select your genre, preview the trailer, & add to watchlist for later or watch it right then...<br />If it hadn't been for my girlfriend, I would never have chosen this movie...glad she did!  I don't think kids can fully understand some of the humor, but I guess since it's animated/cartoon, it's made for kids.<br /><br />Who knew animated/cartoon movies could be so much fun!
B004LWZWGA|4.0|This review contains spoiilers. I understand that this movie is trying to be portrayed in the real world, yet there is so much that is unrealistic. Bruce Wayne would never abandon Gotham even if his work was done, and if he did he would always leave a replacment. We will then have to believe that he knew Robin/Blake would find his batcave. But I believe for sure that the real batman would never be so petty as to leave his lifelong father figure Alfred over a woman he never even dated once. Other then that the movie has great action. Bane is truly a bad ass who hammers Gotham into submission. He is truly a force of nature in this movie. That brings me to another problem. I dont believe that Bane would ever be a slave to the wims of anyone wheather it be Talia, or Ra's Al Ghoul. Ra's and Talia are stonch believers in saving the planet also. They would never destroy a city using a atomic weapon. It would have made more sense if he had done it on his own, since he was thrown out of the League of Shadows. But to repeat, Bane is nobody's toy. Talia Al Ghoul was a worthless addition in other words in my opinion.<br /><br />The fight scene between Bane was good, Batman meets a man who can stand up to him face to face. The end result is Batmans near destruction. One more problem is Batmans silly trust in Catwoman. She not only is a thief, takes him to Bane to be killed, but she also leaves him to die in a hole in the ground. Yet he goes and gives her a program, and also still trusts her to save the city.<br /><br />So to repeat. The story has alot of holes, from Bane turning into some simplering love slave, to Batman trusting Catman. There is also alot of great stuff. Bane is a great villain, and there is alot of good action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One word: GREAT. You should all buy this, it is totally worth the 7 dollars. Great great great great great great.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Looper is a good movie if you can over look its faults. I think that it has alot of good action, and an interesting plot line. Sometimes it focuses to much on the young looper, taking care of Emily Blunt. I think other then that the movie had alot of good action scenes. Bruce Willis character was very interesting, and did a great job of portraying an unstoppable terminator type hitman.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a fast-paced, suspenseful movie and well-acted. It was also a good historical review of the times. It was a terrific story.

B004ZGI1V0|5.0|What a great mystery!  I came across it by accident and I love Liam Neeson so I figured why not.  WOW.  Great movie, great suspense and what a plot twist.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a well woven story about two young people falling in love but it is much more.  The book isn't really a romance as much as a book about the strength that can come from horrible experiences.  This is one of the best books that I have ever read and I can't wait to see more from Colleen Hoover.  I didn't really care for the opening but otherwise it was a great book.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|All of the Drizzt books are amazing and never lack for intrigue, action and adventure. I would recomend all of R.A. Salvatore's books to anyone old enough to read them. They are like reading a movie in your head. When you come to the end of one you can't wait to pick up the next. It's a story you wish would never end.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I just finished watching the on-demand video last night and  was disappointed.  The movie started out typical James Bond - action action action - with James chasing the bad guy to retrieve a hard drive.  Car chase (natch!), motorcycle chase (natch!) and then atop the train James and the bad guy fist fight.  The hard drive is around his neck and James is trying to grab it.  Overhead on a hill Ms. Moneypenny (odd name), the sharpshooter, is getting orders from M to take a shot, even if it means hitting James, which she does.  And down James goes, falling into the waterfall.  There's no other movie hero that has action openings like James Bond.<br /><br />Of course, our hero is alive, even though he's been shot by the bad guy and by Moneypenny.  How does that happen?  Suspend disbelief.  There is a lot of suspend disbelief throughout this movie and plot holes and it becomes a bit annoying.  there is a lot of conversation in this movie, especially from M (Judi Dench) and that becomes annoying after a while.  The main bad guy, Silva (Barden), and his motive for wanting to kill M, makes no sense.  The Silva character is not menacing, scary or threatening.  He's more MAD than anything else.  Nothing about this movie made sense and it was quite boring at 2-1/2 hours long.<br /><br />The movie is also repetitive with James landing in water at least three times during the movie.  I've seen that underwater scene too many times in Bond movies.  The cinematography was blinding.<br /><br />Among the James Bond movies, this one was a dud.  Casino Royale is still the best Daniel Craig/James Bond movie IMO.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is better than Facebook's CityVille. I don't know why, but I love the trucks and things that go to the different buildings. Has things an actual city should have.

B00136JS12|5.0|This debute release should be in Websters Dictionary under the definition of classic rock. There's not a throw away track on here! This is as strong of an album as has ever been released! Pure perfection!!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|This is a must-have case for the GoPro.  The sides are open so you have access the SD card, USB port, etc.  While it generally protects the GoPro from falls and such, the important thing is that it protects the GoPro's lens by not having to remove the unit every time you wanted to charge the unit or access the card.  Now, the case stays on.  Of course, it's not water or weather proof in this case, but simply switching to the sealed case when needed is easy.  Otherwise, my GoPro lives in this case.  Get one!
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|The classic masters of heavy rock return to knock it out of the arena! It's been far too long waiting for these guy's to finally give their fans what they want. They prove here that they've still got that certain magic, but now the question remains.....will they act on it? This cd is great!! I'd like to hear more!
B005VPRETE|5.0|Bought these for a birthday gift for a 10 year old girl.  She loves the set and loves the feminine colors.  Legos has very nice instructions now compared to when they first came out.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|For some reason I could  never get into the Persona series. I tried them, then it would almost immediately be decided that this style of JRPG just wasn'r for me. Then, when Persona 3 went on special, I decided to give it another try. After 96 hours later, I was hooked! When I heard of P4G, I just couldn't believe it. Immediately I felt at home. The presentation, the colors, the sound track, the characters and the relationships (Social Links), and the mystery story, all come together perfectly to make a truly engrossing experience. Sure, it definetely helps if you are a fan of JRPG's (lots of grinding), slice of life social sims (every day life) and definetely Anime in general (all the usual tropes surface). I definetely recommend this title as it perfectly fits in a mobile environment. Finally I put away buyer's remorse for my VITA.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is without a doubt the best book I've read in years, the setting, the pacing and how little tidbits of information build up over time to make a cohesive story, just fantastic
B00APUYWYA|4.0|As most people know by now, this movie has tons of quotable lines. I rented it off Amazon Instant Video and had great streaming quality. There were a couple times where the movie stopped to buffer, but that could have been a result of my spotty Internet service.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|This is a rare find -- fine pop craftsmanship, and hardly a weak tune on the entire album.  The vocal harmonies are woven together in a beautiful tapestry, with enough variety to keep things interesting from track to track.  I saw them live recently and what struck me is that they can replicate the studio sound perfectly live because they don't rely on production tricks to make their sound: all five band members sing, so the full impact of what you hear on the album is reproduced live.<br /><br />While 'Hero' is the track that has gotten the most airplay, I'd say any of the first four tracks are equally radio-ready.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book...Card uses such imagination and detail in his books.  I would definitely recommend this book for any science fiction fan.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I got hooked on the first season and will continue to watch the second season on Showtime. Clare Danes great!
B0060MYM7O|1.0|Hate to do this bc the show is awesome but the digital copy insert is missing from the package. Seems a lot of people are having this problems and repeated emails to HBOdigital copy support have not been answered. Some people have had luck by emailing a pic of the front and back of their DVD case for proof of purchase but not me. I only bought it on bluray for the special features and the digital copy so I could watch something on plane trips (no reason to buy if you have HBO otherwise)...severely pissed off right now.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I listen to this all the time. Love Philip Glass, I other Philip Glass CDs. Loved the movie as well.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The only thing I don't like about this game I that you have to spend real money to buy gems to use on anything good. Why can't they make a game that is totaly free<br />to play?
B00AU15HPC|4.0|Nice album and a welcome release by Justin.  The production and songs strongly harken to the style of \\"The View From The Hill\\" and \\"Strange Times\\".  Thoroughly enjoyed this, great songs and structure and guitar playing.  The included remixes and redone cover of It's Cold Outside of Your Heart and Broken Dream are really more of bonus track type material.<br /><br />My only regret was discovering this was coming out on vinyl after I ordered the CD, dengit!<br /><br />Recommended for casual Moodies and Hayward fans and a MUST for completists and fanatics.

B002VRZEYM|1.0|The movie presents as bad things: the USA, oil, the military, carbon, meat, coal, cars, corporations, profits, banks...  However, according to the movie there are a few good things: beans, rice, PETA, walking, very small farms, no profits, lots of free things...  Watch this movie to see how really stupid the extreme left gets.

B000SEGUDE|3.0|This story is multifaceted, but wonderful, just difficult to read as it threads from one place in time to anouther. Its like stading in front of an abstract painting, it takes awhile to see what the artist is actually trying to say.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|The writer of this story line has really related it to real life, unlike these crazy reality shows.  You need to watch the movie a couple times before you get everything out of it.  It is deep.  You finding yourself agreeing with so many things that are within the story line as you relate it to your own life.  One of our favorite (the wife and I) movies or all time.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|This story was wonderful. The writer took the life of a distraught boy through an adenture that ends in taking his life by the one thing he hid behind. The story is profound.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The special effects to make a young Bruce Willis were impressive, but the movie was very disappointing.  Story line for present day was too sci fi.  Supposedly the premise was 2044 and 2014.  The loop was 30 years.  2014 was insane.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one you can sink your teeth into. Would make a great movie too! I hadn't read any of his recent books, they got too far out for me, but this one has pulled me back into the fold
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Miyazaki has been a favorite of mine for many years. If there is one artist I can say has never let me down, it is Miyazaki (well, him and Tolkien, so you see how highly I regard his work). Every one of his movies are amazing, from his epic masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, to his more down to earth family affairs such as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro. So how does Ponyo stack up against the other films in Miyazaki's arsenal?<br /><br />Well, not as well as I was hoping, though far from bad.<br /><br />Ponyo is something different from Miyazaki, a kind of movie he hasn't really done since Kiki's Delivery Service. This is a movie aimed at children and children alone. It's a big change from Howls Moving Castle which, though enjoyable for kids, was aimed as much towards young adults as it was towards children. Ponyo is Miyazaki's take on the story in The Little Mermaid. A young goldfish, Ponyo, meets a boy named Soscay and decides against her father's wishes that she wants to be human. What follows is a dazzling display of color and artistry that puts to shame most children's movies made in America today. Let's face it, American animation is mostly garbage with no style, no vision, and no heart. If Ponyo is anything, it's a visually stunning work of art from a studio and director who don't mess around. Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki have been turning out amazing looking films for decades and Ponyo is simply the tip of the spear. Its visuals and creativity are outstanding in every way imaginable. It just leaves you lost in the moment in a way no other children's movies, with the exception of the better Pixar movies, can.<br /><br />More than anything else, though, Ponyo is a cute film. Ponyo's character design is just perfect to portray a little girl of her age, and with her level of naivety considering she IS a fish who just recently learned to be human. Soscay's interactions with his mother during the first half of the film (and her interactions with her husband) are so real and heartwarming I couldn't help the giant smile that crept onto my face. This is a heartwarming film.<br /><br />However there is a downside to this film. Miyazaki has always been one for incredible plots that, to the outside viewer, seem to make little sense. Trying to explain the plot of Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away to someone who's never seen those movies is next to impossible. But even those films had their right foot firmly planted in reality despite their fantasy settings. The people in those movies seemed like real people, and their problems like real problems. The plots, though fantastical, made perfect sense within the worlds they've created. Although it may seem like a trivial thing to point out in a children's movie, Ponyo to be blunt is just nonsensical. For instance Soscay's mother, Leslie show's an alarming lack of concern for her five year old son who she leaves at home during a flood so bad it leaves her entire home town under water. Not only does she leave him there, but not once did she seem to worry about his safety. Miyazaki is famous for his incredible portrayal of realistic strong, independent women in his movies, so it's a real shame that Leslie didn't a) have a bigger role in the film, or b) act all that realistic once the second act began. She's an extremely likeable and well-crafted character at the beginning of the film, but somewhere along the way it seems the writers forgot about her and just used whatever excuse they could to get Soscay and Ponyo alone together. Again, this may sound trivial considering it IS a children's movie, but again I would like to point out this isn't just ANY children's movie, it's a MIYAZAKI children's movie, and that normally means it's a family movie that everyone can enjoy. It also seems to me that the characters of Soscay and Ponyo could have been used better had they been a bit older. The plot centers around Soscay needing to love Ponyo in order to bring balance to the world (or something), but creating a love story like this around two five year olds just seems odd. Creating a love story between  two young adults, ala Castle in the Sky, would have been more credible and would have made the stakes more real.<br /><br />I just don't see many adults enjoying this film, or at least not enjoying it in the way they might enjoy Spirited Away or Castle in the Sky with their children. Don't let my negative tone fool you into thinking I didn't like Ponyo, by its own merits it's a good movie and certainly better than the trash most children's films are these days. Hence the positive rating. But I come to expect a bit more than just good from Miyazaki, which may not be fair I know, but when a director has such a consistent record of excellence, when I get merely good it's a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />So if you're going to see Ponyo, and your over the age of say sixteen, watch it with a kid. Any kid. I guarantee they will love it, and you'll get a kick out of watching them love it.<br /><br />Replay value; moderate.g balance to the world (or something), but creating a love story like this around two five year olds just seems odd.

B00942G4UA|5.0|good and makes you think about where our food comes from and what happens during all the process so I say good
B00AREIAI8|3.0|As stated the graphics on this game are amazing. The movements are true to life with lead changes and jumping. The camera takes very nice pictures. However when I play it on my Kindle Fire, it will only load about two out of every five times. The other times it will go to a black screen, or it will freeze on the title picture.<br />I would enjoy this game much more if it loaded every time I asked it to. Otherwise, the graphics and overall gaming experience are quite nice.<br /><br />*Edit: March 30: I completely uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now it loads every single time. It loaded back to the last level I was at when I had last connected to wifi. Now the only bad thing is the lag time. Usually when I turn off the Kindle and put it to sleep then turn it back on, it'll come back to the same part of the competition without the lag. Much better overall.
B008476HBM|3.0|I was wholly engrossed by the novel. But this particular version of the book purchased for kindle is really bad. Text at some pages are not aligned. It was similar to reading a PDF in kindle. Better to read the book through PDF.

0553801473|2.0|I have read each installment of this series as it has come out.  This is the first one I have refused to finish.<br /><br />Aside from being unnecessarily verbose, the story is told from no less than a dozen points of view.  There is only enough time to start to get the rhythm of one character's narrative before the text abruptly jumps tracks to another character.  As a result the myriad perspective changes read as nearly frenetic, and the flow of the story is quite disjointed.  This is more a collection of vignettes than a novel.  It almost gives the feeling that Mr. Martin has begun writing specifically for the purpose of an easy conversion to screenplay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is very awesome!!! if played regular,New York,and now Rome I think they could come up with more like space,gladiator,super hero's,or a cartoon version
B0012HEB32|5.0|I'm a Terminator movie fan, I was kind of reluctant o see the tv series because I though it was not good enough.<br />But for my surprise the series captured my attention since the chapter one, good actors, excellent special effects among others things make this a really good tv series.<br />You will have a good moments watching this series.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|When my husband and I started watching this I almost stopped the movie because I felt the nudity, drugs, and alcohol were going be the theme of this movie.  I'm not a prude, but I thought the movie was about a plane crash.  The story is told about addictions and broken relationships.  I thought the characters and acting were very good.  I won't give away the ending, but it is surprising and emotional.  Worth the wait.
0307346617|4.0|Some interesting ideas in this book, different angle than previous zombie books. If you like zombies, it's worth reading, if only to prep for the Brad Pitt movie. I definitely like it, but it has a real teen novel feel to it at times even though the themes are adult.

B0011Z77OK|1.0|1st off, I LOVE this album and is why I purchased the MP3 from Amazon.<br />Reason Im giving this 1 star is for the poor audio quality of it. It sounds like someone tried to poorly remaster the audio before uploading it for sale. RHCP are known for great, clear, recordings, and this MP3 sounds like the eq levels were raised thru the roof causing clipping and major distortion in the actual tracks. Sounds like when you turn your car stereo up wayyy too high and its that same distorted sound. The fact that it sounds like this even at the lowest volumes tells me its in the tracks themselves, and not because of anything else. This isnt the 1st time Ive gotten bad MP3s from Amazon. Who or what department can I contact about the poor MP3 issues?<br />Amazon needs to incorporate full quality audio previews so you can hear exactly what youre about to order before you commit. I hate being surprised, and more importantly I HATE wasting money.<br />I cant even listen to this MP3 album its that bad. If I were playing it on cheap equipment, maybe it wouldnt sound so terrible. But since Im playing it on halfway good equipment, I can hear every poor detail in the music....which is basically the entire album. Only one song on it has decent quality audio and that song is &#34;Soul to Squeeze&#34;. Problem is, I didnt buy an ENTIRE album to listen to ONE song.<br />Is this issue maybe due to the low price tag on it? Ive read ALL Amazon MP3s are at 256k...hardly seems true since that usually is very close to cd quality audio, and Ive had this album on cd and it sounded fantastic as most RHCP albums do.<br />VERY disappointed with Amazons MP3 rip offs!<br />If you dont care about sound quality...youll LOVE this.

0307949486|5.0|Let me start off by saying, this is an excellent book.<br /><br />I was slightly skeptical, because with the last few books that I've read which had major buzz surrounding them I've been slightly-greatly disappointed. (The Help being only slightly, Water For Elephants being the one I was greatly disappointed in.)<br /><br />The only real disappointment in this book for me was the fact that it starts out so dryly. I'm a reader who loves those books that grab you right from the very first line, and I have to say that this book didn't do that at all. It stays a little dry for about the first 75-100 pages. Some people might want to give up before then, but I have to say, if you pick this up and want to do that, please don't. Stick with it. It gets a  lot better.<br /><br />There are so many people in this book that at times it's hard to keep track of them all. The mystery surrounding Harriet is, in my opinion, the main storyline of the book. Stieg Larsson really knew how to keep his readers on their toes, because I would think I had begun to sort it out and something else would be added to the web of puzzles to keep you guessing and thinking.<br /><br />As a bit of a warning there is some intense subject matter in this book, so be forewarned if you are squeamish about sexual subjects. I'm not all that squeamish but I have to admit there were parts that had me saying out loud to myself, \\"This is just sick.\\"<br /><br />The characters have a lot of interesting relationships between each other. The most interesting to me is Lisbeth and Mikael. Lisbeth is so closed off with everyone else that it's a bit unusual to see her open up and be so comfortable with Mikael. I felt for Lisbeth's character a great deal, and when I got to the ending I was really rooting for her but was a bit disappointed when she was let down by the last scene. I won't spoil it, but I said to myself when I got to the end \\"Really? It had to end like that?\\"<br /><br />I relate to Lisbeth a great deal though I'm not rebellious at all like she is. I probably relate to her because some of her qualities are the ones I wish I had. I'm very interested to see what happens with her character.h I'm not rebellious at all like she is. I probably relate to her because some of her qualities are the ones I wish I had. I'm very interested to see what happens with her character.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Loved this book!  This was the \\"I want more\\" that you always seem to feel when you finish a great book.  Loved to hear someone else's point of view on the story that had just developed before, but then to also develop the \\"next chapter.  Could not put  this one down either and already looking to the next as well.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has been played by many many actors from Basil Rathbone to Jeremy Brett to Benedict Cumberbach to Johnny Miller. I in particular thought Jeremy Brett was the best with Benedict Cumberbach following in a very close 2nd place. Johnny Miller is good but I think the story lost a litle of it's storyline when they moved him to NYC. Sherlock takes an actor with quite a lot of finesse, who can play the several sides of sherlock. But, I enjoyed Robert Downey, Jr. in this version, although I liked him better in Iron Man,
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great read. We are left on the edge many times as this clever and crazy story gets told from different perspectives.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|What a good action movie. Ryan Gosling really came trough with a lot of action and empathy in this one. He looks like the boy next door but can pack a wallop in his acting. Great
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game seems simple enough to start with, and it is a simple concept but so addicting.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes concentration or mahjong style games.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This, to me, was a very engaging and entertaining movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think this was on a par with the best of the superheroes movies. Thank you
1250012570|5.0|In high school, love is all-in, but it's outcome is ultimately out of your control. In Eleanor & Park, Rainbow explores first love against the backdrop of the many forces working against it -- family, friends and the angst of growing up. A must read for youth and adults.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I am 69 years old and I am reliving the childhood I never had because I had to start taking care of my mother and siblings at an extremely early age-5 yrs. old, so I missed out on a lot of things related to childhood. I love cartoons, animals, and action movies and this one has all 3. Thank you, it was very intertaining and I haven't missed one of the movies in this series. Thank you!
B0087HT36U|2.0|I must preface this by saying.that I played the PC version of this first and loved it.  ecame available here I was thrilled. For the first week I was hooked, it was everything I remembered, and I was happy.<br />The problems started though, when I was suddenly unable to complete certain levels, at all. What made it worse was that I could beat these levels on the PC version just fine. I very quickly began to realize that the dev was only interested in my money and forcing me to part with it to complete the game. Making me buy \\"bombs\\" to be able to finish five different levels upset me greatly, why not just charge 4.99 for the game and actually make the levels solvable? Four stars for excellent game minus two for forcing iap on those of us with ocd that have to complete games (angry birds star wars is worse at this but that's another review at another site)

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I'm so happy I did. I looked forward to reading more books by this author.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I wasn't charmed by the vulgarity, although I love Mark Wahlberg as an actor. Seth McFarlane needs to check his crudeness a little more. Other than that, it was an ideal kid's fantasy even when he grew up.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is so cute the games are fun and it has all the voices of the show .you are actually playing in your own ponyville!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Loved the story, Kristen Stewart is a good actree who can make you believe the part she is playing. Charlize Theron is also good as the wicked step-mother. I enjoyed the movie.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I read this book while at an all inclusive resort in Antigua on anniversary.  The depth of research and the easily understandable text with copious references made this a digestible, believable tome.  I started eliminating sugars and carbs from my diet immediately. It is not easy to sustainn this dietary practice without a good degree of willpower primarily because of the rampant presence of sugar and cArbs everywhere.  But I persisted and saw remarkable results<br /><br />I was 5'10\\"  176 lbs.  I am now 159lbs and my last blood test was ideal levels in all areas.  Some side benefits:  no gas, improves oral and gum health, joints feel better, clothes fit better, and skin seems clearer.<br /><br />I've seen Gary on Dr Oz and c an appreciate his claim that our medical community needs enlightenment. It has been blinded by conventional wisdom and forgotten common sense.<br /><br />I have given this book to over ten family members and friends.  Unfortunately not a single one has the willpower to stay with this approach for more than ,,2 weeks.  Sugar is the most serious addiction facing our society.  It is everywhere.  Living in Ct we hear every day about banning guns to make our world a safer place.  Sugar kills more people every day than any weapon in society.  This book should be required reading in every school and medical college.
B000IYUIPK|1.0|I love this movie, however this version was edited for content (they left out ALL the good sex scenes between Harmon and Ryan). This was not advertised in the rental. I was tremendously disappointed.
B000U7169M|5.0|I love these kind of movies. They keep your attention and then blow your mind. I't kept my attention from start to finish. I am glad that I purchased this DVD for my movie collection.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is a movie that kept my interest throughout the film. The turmoil of the times was captured to perfection and although I knew the end result,  the insight to the experience of the people involved kept me glued to my seat, holding my breath, with my heart pumping until the airline pilot announced that they were clear from Iran territory and alcoholic beverages were available. Boy, I needed a drink myself.

B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is beautiful and quite fun to play. However, leveling up skills and improving your gear is very slow past the initial stages, and the arenas quickly become repetitive. I'm level 20 and I have to wait 4 hours for my gear to reach the next upgrade level. Fun, but only in short bursts.
B00005ASOC|5.0|My son watched this in school and came home and made me look it up on the internet. I had to buy it after reading the reviews. This is an awesome movie to have in your movie collection.

0312944926|3.0|A high tech thriller from the mid 90s shouldn't hold up well nearly two decades later but Dan Brown's Digital Fortress does pretty well.  The book is bogged down by tech speak at times and other times that speak seems redundant in this day and age when everyone's grandmother knows what Wi-Fi is.  The characters are interesting but clichéd.  There are some decent twists and a high intrigue level.  Overall, this was a god book that I'm sure I would have enjoyed more had I read it in 1995.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, I seen it at a friends house and I had to have my own DVD.
0307341577|2.0|***SPOILER***<br /><br />As Johnny Depp said in the movie Secret Window, \\"The ending is the most important part.\\"<br /><br />And it's true, especially in a mystery.<br /><br />And I have to say, this ending was so implausible as to induce eye-rolling.<br /><br />The travesty of the ending was made all the more painful by the fact that the book was REALLY GOOD up to that point. The author had constructed a very solid rope from the circumstances of the plot, and all she had to do was allow the rope to tie itself into a tight knot all by itself, just take the pieces she'd already laid out and let them work toward their natural and inevitable conclusion. Unfortunately, the ending she chose involves a number of glaring Red Herrings, plus an extremely unlikely \\"two independent murders happening AT THE SAME TIME,\\" with the second murderer being out of left field (while he was forshadowed, he certainly wasn't central to the plot in any way until the last few moments).<br /><br />I'm going to try another book by this author because the writing itself was excellent and I enjoyed the way she constructed both the characters and the plot. And here's to hoping the next book I read from her has a better ending.
B0016PM722|4.0|I was going to get the lightsaber as a birthday gift but when it arrived, it didn't take me long to realize that it was a much cheaper product than I had ordered. They had sent me a 30$ plastic lightsaber for children ages 6+. I'm sure it was an accident and they sent me a replacement which was flawless (no scratches on the hilt or any problems other people complained about). The reason I give the product 4 stars was because of the initial mistake they made which made me about 3 days late in giving the gift. Overall I am very satisfied with the product and it was so good that I was immediately forgiven for giving the gift late. I would definitely recommend this product to others because I'm pretty sure their shipping mistake was very rare. The lightsaber itself looks and feels incredible and I think it's definitely worth it.The stand is awesome as well. Would have been an easy 5 stars from me if I wasn't sent a plastic one initially.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good flick - but best picture??? Accurate reflection on the state of the US movie industry -total entertainment; no artistry.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|saw it at the theater and it was good, thought I'd get it for home, and it's a good view but stupid story line.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I don't have a lot of games that I play that much, but this is one of the special ones. I recently got this and thought this is one strange game. After playing it a little while, I decided that it was one of the best games of all kindle fire apps. It has smooth gameplay, great graphics and an inventive storyline. I hope you'll get this game. Money well spent.
0525478817|5.0|Have you ever read a book that rips your heart out in the most excruciatingly brutal, yet beautiful way? The kind that reminds you of the fragility of life and the importance of deeply connecting with those you love? If not, then you never read The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green. As clichéd as it may sound, this book will change your life. It will fill you up with love and light, sadness and death, and make you laugh out loud at the same time. Mr. Green's writing is so intelligent, so complex and original, it will take your breath away.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is the story of Hazel, a 17 year-old girl with terminal cancer. Knowing she doesn't have long to live, and wanting to make her parents happy, she attends a support group for kids with cancer. There, she meets Augustus Waters, a character like none I've ever read before. Augustus is beautiful inside and out and speaks in an authentic yet poetic voice throughout the novel. Augustus knows that life is short, and he wants to go out in a big, dramatic way, and make a heroic impact on the world before he goes. Hazel, however, is content with being an observer of the world, noticing the nuances of behavior and relationships. She believes that loving a select few deeply is more important than loving many far and wide. The conversations between Hazel and Augustus and their friends are sophisticated and witty. You root for them throughout the story, while knowing deep down that they are very sick and miracles are in short supply.<br /><br />The love story between Augustus and Hazel is luminous. And, although John Greene will rip your heart along the way, he somehow manages to give you the tools you need to recover from the pain. He manages to fill you up enough with hope and faith to make it through this story. Yes, The Fault in Our Stars is sad, at times heart wrenchingly so. But this book is so much more than that - it resonates deeply in your soul and makes you look at the world with a corrected lens, makes you see the importance of loving deeply. This book enables you to look at the surplus of beauty in your life and be grateful for it. Life is short, don't pass up The Fault in Our Stars.<br />It's a book that will stay with you for a very long time.<br /><br />~Review by The Fictionista at When Pen Met Paper

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky and Dean  are developed as  &#34;romantic characters&#34; with innate powers to cope with their problems. This is life as we imagine it, rather than reality. We read about such heroism in order to learn how to live better. With this in mind, Hopeless is a great read; entertaining, insightful, and romantic.  There are many reasons to read well written novels, and different readers will find certain themes which stand out for them. Teen readers may find insight into the long term effects of  their sexual activity.<br />Again, the judgement and actions of the main characters provides much to think about.  Very Good Book!
B005DD7H50|2.0|As much as I love Bradley Cooper, and he was his charming self........this movie just wasn't for me!  Fell asleep!
B00003CXCS|5.0|This is great for my movie collection, but I was super surprised at much I enjoyed the 87 minute documentary about how the movie came to be, it was fascinating, and the interviews with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and other cast members was perfect.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Thousands  of reviews on  this book so i dont even know if anyone will be reading this review but i still felt i haad to share. Maybe I should have read some of the reviews before reaading this but I wanted to give it a chance because I have enjoyed other N Sparkes books before.  In reading it and knowing that Katie had a secret I immediately thought that she escaped from and abusive husband but hoped I was wrong because that would be do obvious and so done before. I was so dissapointed to know that that was in fact the big mystery. Come on Nick what happen to originality! The characters were also very one dementional. Perfect or evil. Even through what was supposed to be the climax, I found myself skimming to just get through it already. The author has not only copied the theme of \\"Sleeping with the enemy\\", but didn't veer to far away from the theme of his own story, \\" The lucky one\\" - evil ex,  vs. perfect boyfriend- one of them has to die. If you haven't seen sleeping with the enemy and are not too into character development then its not a horrible read. Otherwise you may feel like you have wasted your time and money.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I confess I do not always find some passages of this book nice reading: too gory and too mystical. But the final result is fantastic, An unbelievable story that becomes an adventure as the ones I used to read as a boy. Beautiful images and an underlying humor that makes the whole thing somewhat of a caricature of action movies. What Pi tells can be interpreted in many ways, and the reader knows the simple rendering he gives at the end is only one of many other possibilities and meanings. Very clever and very entertaining.
B008IJRT6I|5.0|If you download this app, you can tap your way into oblivion.  And tapping has never been more fun!  The only strange thing about this game is that the music sounds kinda like that you would hear in a porno movie.  Not that I would ever or have ever seen that kind of thing before.  :o  LOL
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I have to admit that it is a fun and addictive game, trying to complete goals and gathering families, one can spend hours at a time engrossed in it. It is very easy to be lured into spending real money purchasing the ever elusive acorns! A word of warning to the unsuspecting gamer, whatever you do, no matter how tempting . . . DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS APP!!! It comes down to the fact that there are far too many bugs, glitches, traps, and annoyances to deal with. I have spent real money in my pursuit of the almighty acorn, only to have millions gold coins worth of animals, and thousands acorns worth of animals just disappear and be lost due to the GameLoft corporate greed! If one does encounter a disappointing experience of a loss such as myself and others has encountered, you will be lucky to get reimbursed, and even if you are one of the lucky ones (ha ha ha), it will not by any means be a quick of even timely repair. No doubt one will be stressed out by the time GameLoft give any real assistance. Sure they will respond immediately with a generic email telling that they are &#34;looking into the problem&#34;: and &#34;trying to get it taken care of&#34;, but do not get your hopes up.<br />I recently updated to the latest updated to find all of the Dinos that I had purchased were gone. Not in the collection, not in the inventory, just gone. In the evidence of my collections I can see some of the missing Dinos, as if I could just go back and pull them out of the tar pit they may have wandered into, but alas, they are not there. Not to mention all the crashes in the friend area, and the ever increasing requirement of acorns to accomplish the new goals and activities, with the lessened chance of earning them. Gameloft has made it basically impossible to accomplish any real game play without purchasing the Acorns with real money. The pricing of the animals, land, decorations, and fun buildings are in no way relative to their size, nature or any other reasonable method, it is just random, and usually outrageous, and ever increasing!<br />So to sum up, if one does purchase this app/game, do so cautiously. Take it slow (very slow, because that is how it will go), and don't spend any real cash! It will be regretted. Deal patiently with the ever occurring  crashes and bugs. Try not to get pulled in to the tar pit of Gameloft.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Typical Stephen King - great writing and you find yourself lost in the book.  Unfortunately, you get snapped back to reality quickly, because the book is so short!  I gave it 4 stars, because I wanted it to be longer.

B001FB563E|4.0|Some movies are hard to watch, and The Road belongs in that category. But I have chosen to review it because it deserves an audience.The director is John Hillcoat, who was responsible for The Proposition and Lawless. Like both of those movies, this one features music composed by Nick Cave. The bleak nature of the story is a perfect fit for Cave's music.<br /><br />As you might expect, the movie didn't have much of an impact at the box office. I suppose that most people are reluctant to expose themselves to such a sad story?<br /><br />When you strip it right down, the film is about the love a father has for his son. We never learn their names; any references made simply refer to The Man (Mortensen) and The Boy (Smit-McPhee). These two actors carry the movie, but we occasionally see people they encounter, and flashbacks of The Man's wife (Theron). Her role is small, but the scenes are effective, and help to frame the story.<br /><br />There are many reasons to see this movie.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen delivers a superb performance that failed to receive the Oscar recognition it deserved. Perhaps the voters never saw the movie either?<br /><br />We learn that The Man's wife couldn't face life in a world where everything was dying, so he is solely responsible for his son. The reason for the apocalypse is only hinted at, and mentions a sudden light. It leaves the skies permanently gray, and everything covered in a layer of ash. Trees, plants, and insects are dead or dying. The only life remaining comes in the form of a few humans, and many of them aren't too fussy about how they survive.<br /><br />Perhaps this is what the world might eventually look like if Earth was struck by an asteroid?<br /><br />The movie could be viewed as a metaphor for life itself. When we face terrible events in our own lives, most of us choose to weather the storm and survive to the best of our abilities. Imagine a life where there was nothing left to achieve. What would you do? The Man decides that he will take his son to the coast. Perhaps things will be better there, and maybe there will be something left alive.<br /><br />What makes The Road an astounding story is the writing. Cormac McCarthy's book is strangely moving. It succeeds because of the intensity of the brief dialog between father and son. The son asks a lot of questions, and often wonders whether they are the good guys. The father explains as well as he can, and his son accepts all of his words without question.<br /><br />The Road is nothing like McCarthy's No Country for Old Men, and isn't designed to be a piece of entertainment. It's a study on human character, and what drives us to exist at all. I admire post-apocalyptic stories when they are done well, and this is about as realistic as it gets. If you enjoy seeing how society breaks down when money is meaningless and food is scarce, you'll find the story interesting. If you are a parent, I would be surprised if you aren't moved at the love between father and son.<br /><br />What would you do to protect the life of your child? How would you justify your actions? Could you kill and still be a good person?<br /><br />I won't reveal how the story ends, or comment on whether it is uplifting or as sad as the rest of the movie. That's for you to discover. All I will see is that The Road is a significant achievement, and brings to life a book that seemed almost impossible to film. The cinematography is particularly convincing.<br /><br />If you are a fan of The Grey, The Mist, Children of Men, or The Stand, there's a fair chance you'll find something interesting in The Road. Don't watch it if you are expecting an action movie.<br /><br />The Blu-ray offers a strong presentation, but it won't dazzle you because the colors are deliberately muted to fit the story. You need to be in the right mood to watch The Road, but it's worth it when that mood strikes. You'll never take another meal for granted.des that he will take his son to the coast.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|As an Iranian, I saw many defects to this movie. First of all the movie showed many places where the Iranian(or Afghans who played as Iranians) didn't use basic technology like wireless radios for communications and had to run through the airport to carry a message, or the other groups working at the airport wouldn't listen to the guards. And most important of it had so many points that one can't believe weather they were fact or fiction.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Awesome.... Glad to have it now on Video. Actors/Actress are wonderful. Do recommend this to all.<br />Glad to have it on BluRay...
B009FOBMBI|5.0|Three Days Grace never disappoints. Always bringing consistently great sound with lyrics that are easy to relate to. And the price from Amazon can't be beat!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Not only did I love the movies themselves, I loved this set. While looking through the book, I didn't feel as if it was an abridged version; it was the perfect size. The box itself is also very nice. Plus, it contains a code for Ultra-Violet copies of each movie.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Vaguely heard of Tin Tin and did hear some good things about this animated film. The animation is just incredible and even though it's your typical action adventure flick, I thought it had a decent plot line to it. Add some elements of light comedy and you have a good hour and a half escape.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My wife was hooked on this series and she was not disappointed except now she has to wait for the next season to be available.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|I have only seen it once and it may hit four stars after a view or two more, but my first impressions was it was OK. The biggest thing  for me was that it felt like it  it was choped short and you had that being left hanging feeling.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I feel like I'm always the last person to join in to the latest trends. The book was good--I really liked the writer's style (I don't read fictional books that often).
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I now understand the title and why it is appropriate.  It is an old idea, but shown in a new light.  I particularly liked the methods taught and the suggested exercises.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Wonderful scenery, great story of life. My children are 16, 14 and 13. All of them enjoyed the film. Amazon charging only $13.99 for a family of 5 to see this movie was a great value.
B000077VR3|1.0|Didn't know it was a blu ray disc, I don't have a blu ray player!  All it said was dvd widescreen edition.
B00005JL96|5.0|Video shopping on line I found this video for my kids. Good quality, arrived as listed on posted add, and good price : ) Recommend buyer.
B0034G4P80|5.0|My son loves action movies and he loves the whole super hero thing, well this movie has both in my opinion. I think that there is a hero and a villian, there is a plot, and the movie does not show anything that would be offensive to a child. At least one that is 11 years old anyway. The main thing that I liked about the movie is that it had great actors in it who did a wonderful job and it told a great story of how one should be. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who likes action/hero movies, or families who want to sit down together and watch a really good movie.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This album is great! Every song is a great song and most all are fast and catchy. It's a family fave cd to listen to and even my multiply handicapped daughter loves it and 'dances' to it! :)

B00BESLHEA|4.0|Not my favorite Tarantino, but pretty good. The martial arts choreography  and cinematography was fantastic, but the story needed help. Great popcorn movie though.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I have seen them all and really think this is the best. I still have a soft spot for Thunderball and Sean Connery but Skyfall is just such a good production I think it gets the top spot.

B005FI6IRG|5.0|Gorgeous songs, and beautiful compositions. One of the best CD's I've ever purchased. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this style of music.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|The book's structure is what usually gets the most attention. The first five stories are each cut off in mid-telling (even in mid-sentence, in the first chapter), a sixth story is told in full, and then the first five stories are completed. The stories occur in chronological order up to chapter six, then reverse chronological order, so the book's structure is 1-2-3-4-5-6-5-4-3-2-1. Each chapter is written in a unique voice, with a style that perfectly fits the era being depicted. On a superficial level, the various stories are linked through fairly mundate plot devices, but on a deeper level there is a subtle linkage in which the events of the first/last chapters indirectly influence the events of the later stories. Without giving away any details, suffice it to say that each story influences a character in the following story in such a way as to alter subsequent events.<br /><br />***VERY MINOR SPOILER ALERT--The next paragraph contains a very barebones description of when each chapter takes place and who the protagonist is. For me, this information wouldn't have spoiled any of the stories, but purists may want to stop reading this review here.***<br /><br />The first chapter occurs in the 1850s, and is the diary of a traveller returning home from the South Pacific. The next consists of a set of letters written by a ne'er-do-well young composer in 1930s Belgium. The third is a mystery novel that revolves around a reporter in 1970s America. The fourth is the story of an elderly publisher in 1990s England. The fifth is a hologram interview with a clone set in some undefined future Korea. The sixth is an oral history being told by a tribesman in post-apocalyptic Hawaii some hundreds of years after the fifth story.<br /><br />***MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT SPOILER ALERT--For the rest of the review, I'm going to talk about how the events of the first/last chapters reverberate through the other stories and may even influence the ultimate fate of human civilization, but I can'tdo this without going into greater detail about the stories themselves. If you haven't read this book, you might want to stop here; if you have read it, please read on and tell me what you think of this analysis.***<br /><br />When I initially finished reading this book, I thought it was pointless. Interesting structure, sure, but other than fairly pedestrian linkages between the stories (a character in one story reads the previous story, and his story is subsequently read by a character in the next, and so on) and a kind of lame effort at suggesting that each protagonist was a reincarnation of the previous one (not sure how that would have worked for Timothy Cavendish, since he would have been alive at the same time as Luisa Rey), I didn't see any meaningful connection. After thinking about it a while, it dawned on me that there was a much more subtle thread woven throughout the novel that ties everything together. Much of this requires some extrapolation from what's in the novel, so it's clearly open to interpretation.<br /><br />Here goes:<br /><br />Adam Ewing's act of kindness (saving the escaped slave) is repaid when the slave saves his life, much to the surprise of Robert Frobisher, who thought Goose would kill him off. Frobisher falls into depression following the completion of his masterpiece. I suspect he also realizes that he's a dirtbag compared to the likes of Ewing, who not only survived, but went on to devote himself to the betterment of mankind, and this deepens the depression that ends with his decision to kill himself. How does this affect the Luisa Rey story? The only thing I can suppose is that Frobisher's suicide removed a corrupting influence that might have otherwise diverted Sixsmith from life as an honest physicist. If that had happened (for example, by running off with Frobisher), he wouldn't have been in a position to write the report, and it would instead of been written by someone who was able to bought off by the company. Without that,there would have been no basis for the Luisa Rey novel.<br /><br />(Note that since the Luisa Rey story was a work of fiction, the Ewing diary and Frobisher letters are logically also fictional as well. The first \\"non-fictional\\" story is Cavendish's, which was later made into a movie that was ultimately seen by Sonmi-451.)<br /><br />Reading the Luisa Rey novel sparked in Timothy Cavendish the idea of plotting and scheming his way to freedom. Cavendish's ruminations on slavery and how slavers \\"welcome the odd rebel\\" to make an example of is the source of Sonmi's realization that her whole escape is a setup by the corporate powers, and she decides to use their ploy to get her philosophy widely circulated by writing the manifesto that is made public during her trial. Ultimately, her manifesto becomes so widely read and admired that Sonmi comes to be seen as a sort of Christ-like figure. After the fall of civilization, this morphs into actual worshp as a deity in her own right.<br /><br />Now the question is whether the ultimate outcome is positive or negative. Read one way, the book seems to be saying that Ewing's act of kindness ultmately led to the manifesto of Sonmi, and that the ideas the manifesto contained will cause a better civilization to arise out of the ruins of the old one. But read another way, it could be that Sonmi's ideas were ultimately unable to overcome the brutality of mankind, and the last embers of her philosphy are slowly dying out as barbarism destroys everything (this is hinted at by the fact that nobody can even understand her words in the Orison anymore, and the semicivilized tribes that worshipped her were wiped out by the Kona). But since the story-teller in Sloosha's Crossing (the son of Zachry), still speaks of Sonmi as if she were a goddess, it's ambiguous.

B008OOYALE|1.0|I started playing this game and was really enjoying it-so much so that I actually put down some real money to buy some gold-but after a while I began to notice that there were many, many,  many, things that my \\"neighbors\\" could do that I could not. They could buy and/or breed dragons that I didn't have the option too because they weren't even in my \\"marketplace\\" to buy - neither are tons of the decorations and some of the habitats ...and without the right color habitat there isn't anywhere to put certain dragons even if those dragons were in my \\"marketplace.\\" I also can't do even 1/10th of the goals that non-Kindle users can do. I e-mailed TeamLava about the problem and they wrote back \\" We at TeamLava are sorry for the inconvenience but some devices (such as the Kindle Fire) cannot get the full version of our app. Dragon Story. We hope to upgrade our software very soon. Thank you for your patience.\\"-Well I have been patient ...I WORKED MY WAY UP TO LEVEL 72!!!...(There are only 100 levels) ...and now this game has become boring-boring-boring and repetitive because I don't  have the full game. It would have been nice if TeamLava would have told all the Kindle users out there that their app wasn't  compatible with the Kindle BEFORE we got into the game...and \\"yes \\" I feel like a dope for spending real cash on a game that's  not complete...but I guess that's what TeamLava was hoping for...get the cash and then let the dope find another game. Shame on you TeamLava for not being honest from the beginning...So to sum this up...KINDLE USERS BEWARE!!!

0345803485|1.0|I read the whole thing, though there were many places I thought I couldn't take any more. I almost didn't make it past the first chapter because the word 'sandstone' was repeated so many times, I felt like I was reading a home-improvement book. I can understand why this book might be erotic and exciting for some people, but it wasn't for me. I thought Ana was an idiot with no self-esteem and found Christian to be completely unlikable. The sex scenes were disturbing because I could never quite get past Christian's insistence that he wanted to hurt Ana. Christian struggled with demons and abuse from his past and I could understand why he was a mess, but there was no excuse for Ana. I would have run screaming the moment I saw the 'red room of pain,' yet Ana can't break away from Christian. And the stalking... had Christian been a regular Joe instead of a billionaire, this would have been a Lifetime Television movie instead of a 'romance novel.' Every aspect of their relationship was abusive and unappealing, and though I understand some people are happy in a BDSM lifestyle, I prefer not to read about and will not continue to do so. Though the book has absolutely no ending at all and is merely a stopping point so readers can shell out another 12 bucks to read the next book, I'm ending my Fifty Shades journey right here.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another suspenseful Book by Baldacci. Every time I pick up one Every time I pick up one of his books I know I am in for great reading.
B00003OSU4|5.0|I am pleased with this view of a step back in time. I was thoroughly moved by the brilliant performances of some of my favorites. The likes of which we will not see again. Unfortunately, I never got to see &#34;live&#34;  the genius of Dinah, Louis, Mahalia,Anita of Big Mabelle. So this excellent video gave me but a glimpse of what I missed. Thank you for soothing my soul with Jazz on a Summer's Day.

This feels very solid and the cable is super springy.<br /><br />I mean really springy, like when people get into my car I make them try it out and see how springy it is. Provides hours of entertainment for me as I sit in Houston traffic.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've  never read a Stephen King novel before, but this was recommended by a colleague,so I gave it a try.  The concept of time travel was intriguing and I'm always interested in why Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK. This book addresses both in an entertaining manner. Not calling it great literature, but rather an engaging vacation read.<br />I
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this alarm. I do not like waking up to loud sounds. This lets you wake up to your own music. It starts off very soft and increases to the level you set. Waking up is now just a little nicer.
1401324649|5.0|I won't take the time to tell you what this book is about since you can read that in the synopsis, but I will say read this book!  I've already shared my love of this clever romp with all my friends and family.  This very well might be my favorite book of the century.  I would sit there reading this on the train to work every morning and just laugh myself silly, I know my fellow passengers probably thought I was crazy but I got such a kick out of Allan and his various friends he made, both from the past and the present.  The story did jump back and forth between the past and present a lot, but I thought it was seemless.  I never had a hard time remembering who was who or where we were in the story.  Sheer delight.  Thank you Jonas Jonasson, can't wait to read anything else you write!

B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Barely held my attention for the first 55% of the book. Then it FINALLY got interesting. Not a good book to follow anything related to 50 shades or the Crossfire series. It was poorly written and way too teenager.
0307477479|3.0|\\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" reads more like a collection of short stories featuring 13 loosely connected people rather than an actual novel. I don't typically mind character-driven novels, but this book seemed to lack cohesion in it's narrative. Since each chapter focuses on one of the characters at a given time in their life, it took me 1 to 2 pages (at the beginning of each chapter) to realize who the characters are and what time they were in. I also had to flip through the first few chapters to remember who some of the characters were in the last chapter. Because of this, I found the book a little frustrating. While I thought the \\"short\\" stories were mostly well written, I did not think all the individual stories tied as neatly together as they should have.<br /><br />The chapters also flip from first person, second person and powerpoint presentation (???) story telling. Some of the other readers minded the \\"second person\\" story, I actually understood why this was done for this particular character and thought it was brilliant. The powerpoint presentation was just odd and too long.<br /><br />For me, the book was just ok.

It starts with a bang with 10,000 hours, which is so catchy its even stuck in my head as i write this review. i have heard a ton of hip hop of different artists and styles and i have even done some of my own beats and i used to free style quite well, so i would say i know good hip hop.<br />I cant wait to hear the next ablum.

B0054SMID0|3.0|I was so strung out on Matthew McConaugheys romantic comedies that I almost didnt see this film for that simple fact. I got drawn in because of the lawyer aspect. A law and order lifetimer, i could always use a good courtroom drama. Overall a good film.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|It seems like all recording artists reach a point in their careers when they wish to pay tribute to those songs and artists who inspired them to go down their career paths in the first place. This is Jeff Lynne's version and it's really quite good. Unlike some singers who have merely copied the originals with perhaps too much reverence, these songs are truly recast in  Lynne's voice. You'll hear a lot of ELO style here grafted unto some very memorable songs. The CD is a little short but who knows? Maybe there will be a &#34;Long Wave 2&#34;.I'd buy it.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This film bust through generations.  Loved it as a kid and now can enjoy it with my teens. They loved all the same things i loved about it when i was that age!  Two thimbs up on sentimentality.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I started reading this book on my flight to India. I had never been there before and was scheduled to stay for 2 months. It was such an incredible to book to have read part of prior to my arrival and all along my journey. Many of the crazy things he noticed as he became familiar with India, I also saw and experienced.<br /><br />Beyond learning about India, this book also gives great life lessons learned. I've saved so many quotes from this book and continue to reflect back on them. It is a long book but I'm glad it was. I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />This is one of the books you must read at least once each lifetime.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Not Baldacci's best but certainly not bad. It is an intriguing story but not memorable. It seems to be a beginning of a new series of characters that will lead to sharper stories.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Have truly enjoyed this series of Downton Abbey! Love the charters, keeps you on your toes and unlike some stories you can't figure out what is coming next. Also the story only has a few immoral parts and no bad language. I will say the story would be just as good without what immorality that is in it. But all in all a great story line.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|This book is well researched, well written and very interesting.  Whatever you want to know to be. The &#34;search&#34; expert in your crowd this is what you need.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I read the reviews for this movie on imdb and even on rotten tomatoes which were extremely high (8/10), and after watching this movie I just can't seem to understand how it ever got rated so highly. Perhaps it was the artist element of the movie filled with beautiful imagery, but you can decorate a pile of dung as lovely as you want, but its still a pile of dung. And that is how my wife and I rated this movie. HORRIBLE!!! We would never watch it again unless paid to.
B001O5EH40|1.0|I had this when it first came out on LP so I decided to get it as a 5.1 surround version. Nowhere in the ad says its PAL region 2. Don't buy this version if your player is REGION 1.

B0074YVW1G|4.0|Very interesting and well written. I loved the many examples and credible references. Would appeal to all introverts....or should as it gives a believable alternate long held view that introverts are shy and stupid....not so!
B00AFEY354|5.0|Similar to many others, the book this film is based off of is one of my favorites of all time; I remember reading it in high school over and over and falling in love with the characters over and over, and Chbosky did a fantastic job of bringing his book to life on the big screen. Can't find anything bad to say really, the cast is great and their performances are amazing. It includes all the moments that you remember from the book and won't disappoint anyone who was a fan of the book!<br /><br />Even if you never read Perks, the movie is still great and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Sure to be a classic high school movie alongside The Breakfast Club and many others.
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|It was well written for a wide reader audience with examples to back up described situations. It could appeal to everyone beyond 14 years of age I believe.
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|Josh must have just been fulfilling a contractual obligation when he went into the studio for this cd. Such a great singer and entertainer, but not evident on this album. Terrible.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although this isn't my usual style of reading, it was pretty good.  I will go on to read the other two.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This story is simply amazing, hero's fighting for each other without hesitation is truly inspirational. These men will never be forgotten and will live forever throughout history.
0790725657|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie when I was little girl, and so I've ordered it to re-enjoy with my daughter.  It really is a timeless classic, just as good as I remembered.  Some of the scenes are breath taking, and magical at times.  And when Sara tells her stories, everyone listens.  Every girl is a princess, and it's so important to teach our daughters that!  &#34;Didn't your Daddy ever tell you were a princess?&#34;  Hope my little princess loves it as much as I do.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The word recognition is awesome, Flow is a great addition, and it gets better the more you use it. My most recommended app.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Lot&quot;s of fast paced racung fun. Good graphics abd game play. Very smooth play. Upgrade your car and paint and driver.
B004U52VPS|5.0|no surprises, this toy was like exposed on the site. recommended to the kids that &#34;like to break stuff&#34; !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this show.  Can't wait for next season.  Too bad Matthew had to die but it should make for interesting drama in next season.
B009PJ1Q82|1.0|I went to see this movie because of Thure Lindhardt who was great in &#34;Broderskab&#34;, but here gives a flaccid performance. Even good actors can't save a poorly directed film. The storyline and the acting completely fall apart in this hastily made pretentious melodrama. It is simply bizarre that the movie got 90% critic approval on Rotten Tomatoes. Who are those critics? Are they just friends of the director who went to the same film school together? (Yale, duh)
B004XUMMFE|5.0|classic - worth rewatching.  it is a shame it was only on for 1 season. perhaps something similar will come out.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Very chilling tale set in the Soviet Union about the horrors the orphans and others had to endure.  I enjoyed the book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This series show has so many twists and turns. It's almost impossible to jump ahead and guess the story line. It is engaging and pulls you in. Har to walk away from.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie....complete entertainment from the premise to the music, etc.  Fun for the whole family.  This is one to add to the collection!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|its a new season of doctor who you either like it or you don't but its a fun frolic with the trio and river song and a good twist to start the year but wear a cowboy hat - they;re cool!
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I heard from critics this movie got bad ratings but took a chance. Im glad i did it was a great movie also its a true story. It is worth buying.Good movie for the whole family and a great movie for anyone who loves the ocean or surfing.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This is not one of the better King books I've read.  I didn't think the story was very suspenseful.  In addition, the language and profanity was horrible.  I don't need vulgarity in books to make them good.  The English language is far too rich with words to resort to crudeness over and over again.
0439023513|2.0|Thanks, Suzanne Collins. You managed to write an epic 3-book saga about a girl who starts out as strong and learns to be weak, who always has a one-up on the enemy until she inexplicably just decides to let every situation steamroll her. The \\"girl on fire\\" from the Hunger Games is frustratingly, tragically absent throughout all of Mockingjay. Apparently she really did die at the end of the second book and no one had the heart to tell her, because this Katniss is just the drugged-out ghost of the courageous, never-say-die heroine that kept me voraciously tearing through the pages of the first two books.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I get the feeling that the author was either bored by this time in the marathon writing of the trilogy, or working under such time constraints that she didn't have time for the revision and editing the material desperately needed. First off, the pace drags through most of the book, and then at some point near the end a switch gets flipped and we bolt into super-turbo, where everything is so rushed that we have no time for a proper conclusion. Peeta (probably my favorite character, who she brutalizes beyond recognition--I don't think I can forgive you for that, Mrs. Collins) vacillates on the edge of insanity throughout most of the book until at the end where, in one paragraph, we're told that they've grown back together. No conversation between the two, no explanation. He's not a crazy lunatic anymore, then? Does he actually love her like he did? I feel like a high school English teacher when I say this, but--SHOW ME, DON'T TELL ME. It's as if she reached a page limit and was forced to stop, because even Gale gets shipped off to District 2, presumably forever, with no goodbye. No words at all actually. Just gone. It seems so out of character for both of them not to even attempt any communication after she's shipped back home. And actually, given Gale's past actions, I can't see him just leaving her to her miserable, lonely self in a next-to-deserted district while he flies off to some fancy job. Because even a fancy job seems to contradict the character of someone who eats dog stew and walks around with dead animals attached to his belt. What the heck does he want with a fancy anything?<br /><br />I understand (I think we all understand by now) that Suzanne Collins thinks war is hell. So do we all. But that doesn't mean reading the book needs to be hell. I mean, the first two books had plenty of violence with a dystopian theme, but it didn't feel drenched in a thick coat of despair, despite it all. This book never comes up for air, never lets us see the sun, and it's not better for it. The best parts of the first two books--the overcoming spirit and \\"screw you and your stupid rules\\" attitude of Katniss, the loyalty and self-sacrifice of Peeta, even the interesting juxtaposition of the indulgent Capitol vs. the tattered rabble--are missing here. Her Mockingjay role is a tolerable storyline at best. I had a hard time not wanting to skip over chapters until I realized that, whoa, most of the rest of the story is this way. That is, up until we get to the point where she's wandering through the Capitol, aimlessly fighting pods and accidentally killing off most of the still-likable characters without ever thinking of them again, all for the sake of a stupid mission which never gets completed. Instead she just gets blown up, and her sister just gets blown up, and the rebels capture Snow anyway. The very same day. Pointless. Besides that, saving Prim was the catalyst for every event in the novel, yet her death is treated with such comparative nonchalance. Did she even have to die? Debatable. I'd vote no. But at this point in the story, Collins' thirst for the maiming or misery of every character she's ever created seems pretty insatiable.<br /><br />The talk with Snow, Katniss' muddled relationship with Coin and the rebels, and her ridiculous vote for another Hunger Games seems so disjointed that it's hard to follow. I can not imagine that anyone who had been in the arena would vote to send other children there, I don't care how freakin' shell-shocked they are. And even if she was playing with Coin before her faux-execution of Snow, I don't follow the logic. Maybe I just didn't read it clearly enough, but what do the two have to do with each other?<br /><br />And this brings me to Snow. Snow's character is a disappointment, never expanding beyond mustache-twirling bad guy, even after his capture. And his death--his death, to which the entire series has been painstakingly leading up--is never seen. You just hear that it sorta-kinda might have happened this way. And with this, the climax slams into the ground, because Katniss goes home, stares at a fire, eats, doesn't shower, eats again, continues to not shower, and this goes on for months until Peeta shows up and the whole thing ends with a highly unsatisfying epilogue.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I felt like this book could've been really good. I was so excited to read it, and even though it started off slow I was fully expecting it to pick up and be the grand, exciting conclusion to a story that I felt really deserved a grand, exciting conclusion. And maybe that's where my problem with it lies--the characters never got the ending they deserved, and the audience never got the story that the trajectory of the first two books almost promised it was headed. To me, it was a bit of a selfish novel that elevated the author's agenda over any else, including the tone, the content, and the audiences' expectations. I understand that it's a personal work, but books belong to both the writer and the reader. If she had merely written it for herself, it'd be sitting in her basement unpublished. I so wish I could've gotten a proper ending to the trilogy. It didn't have to be rosy-hued and sugary, but I wanted to see hope. I wanted to see rebirth and renewal in the face of the characters' losses. Instead, I'm left feeling hungry.<br/><br />And I can only hope that when the movie comes out, they make enough changes to the script to allow for a more hopeful tone. I bet they will, because there's only so much spiraling depression that characters--or an audience--can take.
B006C1DH92|5.0|So this version of Fruit Ninja has multiple modes.  It has desperado mode, which goes on forever, and you have to slice fruit while avoiding bombs.  Missing fruit causes you to lose a life (start with 3, if you have lost any, you get one back after every 100 points), and slicing bomb causes you to lose all of your remaining lives.  You are just trying to get the highest score possible.  There are magic beans instead of the bananas of the original.  The other mode is bandito, which is a challenge mode.  You get to pick different types of challenges (which generally say slice X of a certain type of fruit) but the fruit and bombs are sent through in different ways, sometimes on balloons, and sometimes on conveyor belts, among others.  They are all timed.  You have to go through as many as you can, losing the challenge causes you to lose one of three lives.  You have to play four challenges per Act, and there are three Acts and a finale. Very challenging!  This game works well on my Motorola Atrix 4g.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I think this is a great recreation of the origional Packman game. And it's just as fun! The joystick is a bit sticky to me, but that's no big deal. If you're craving an old arcade game to play on your mobile device, I'd definitely recommend this.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This game is fun and challenging, just like the original is.  They've mixed things up a bit so if you've played the original, you won't be bored with this.  There are still introductory levels for those who haven't played the original.<br /><br />The basic mechanics of the game is, there's a spider web with bugs and spiders on it.  You have to cut the spider web to stop the spiders from getting to the bugs.  There are also more abilities that you get depending on the level to add to your strategy.  For example, you can get the ability to freeze spiders to stop them for a few rounds.<br /><br />If you like the original, I highly recommend it.  If you like puzzle games, I would definitely recommend this or the original (though I think the original is easier).  I enjoy it.  It works well on my Motorola Atrix 4g.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book series is one of the few I've read that is truly deserving of a 5 star rating. The writing is top notch, the characters are well-developed, and the story is gripping from beginning to end. At this price there is no reason for any sci-fi fan to not buy this series.
1439170916|5.0|This is an incredible book that documents the history of cancer in the most fascinating page-turning type of way. I am impressed that an oncologist found the time to write such a comprehensive book. Although I am a medical student, I feel that anyone remotely interested in medicine, history or sociology will enjoy this story. I actually worked as a researcher at Brigham & Women's Hospital across from the Dana-Farber building in Boston and loved learning about Sidney Farber and his immense contributions to chemotherapy. Highly recommend!
0765348276|4.0|I just liked this book.  Fast read.  Interesting premise: Changing old men & women into enhanced Star Trooper like (or perhaps Avatar-like) warriors).  And who couldn't use a Brain Pal?  More sex than one might expect.  Some interesting one-on-one human vs alien to-the-death contests.  At the end, though, the book degrades into a standard human vs alien gunfight.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I loved this book. I  could not put it down and purchased the next in the series before I completed this one.  If you enjoy historical fiction as well as thrillers, this is the book for you.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My wife and I greatly enjoyed this series (and now our daughter is a fan, too).  If you liked the first two seasons of Downton Abbey, you will like this one too -- and for the same reasons you liked the first two seasons.  If you didn't like the first two seasons, then you won't be reading this review.

B009VB97EY|1.0|I bought this for my wife as earlier she wanted to go to the theater to see it and I didn't.  Certainly was not my cup of tea.  DVD had odd coloration on our TV set (which no other DVD has had).  No plot to speak of, either.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice clean look. Works well - no problems. I downloaded other calc apps that had little thought put in to how they look.  This one is different.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|This novel shines light on technology across human experience. Written in first person by an everyman, rogue, and archetypal networked, the book brings the reader to see parallel s between the ordinary and the magical.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is the second booth that I have read from this author and they seem to get better each time !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|All members in my family just love it! It is fun and simple to play; howver, it can be challenging.

B00867GHS8|5.0|Great movie that adults & kids will enjoy, the 3D looks amazing,looks like you're really under water with the characters.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I have had this app for a while and Im still finding more clever features.  Lots of interesting information is available.  Nice to be able to change colors, too.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|great for getting to the door when it is dusk and the outside lights haven't engaged.  the color screen feature is not necessary in my life the but spotlight in back is wonderful.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is nice app.  I like it because it gives me an accurate estimate of my battery life available.  I also like the price, and would recommend it to any kindle fire hd users.

B008220DIC|1.0|Boring, listless movie.  Could not even finish it.  Very slow moving - like watching a car crash in slow motion.  Who comes up with this crap?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome can't stop playing it!!!!!!!when I get home I can't put it down I have to play more and more!!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I just bought this. I did a marathon of all ten episodes with my friend yesterday. Absolutely no problems what so ever. I just hope Season 3 will be even more epic. There was also much less sex in this season compared to Season 1.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my favorites. Great plot current with the times. Draws the reader into the world of Mitch Rapp.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|Really not a great movie at all.  The dialogue was difficult, the story did not segue from point to point well, and many scenes were just not pertinent to the movie.  The acting was tremendous, though: Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman did an outstanding job.
B007THA4FI|1.0|If her name had been Johnson, it wouldn't even have made it past the first reader in the publishing house.  Cartoon characters behaving in each frame as they should.  Wrapped up in a tidy package at the end.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I didn't think Bruno Mars could top his 1st album, but I am happy to say I was wrong.  Love this as much as the 1st one.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I found the protagonist, the authorial voice, to be self-indulgent, whiney, irresponsible and fundamentally dull.  I might have said she wasn't too bright either, but she was clever enough to navigate the world of publishing and get this churned out and picked up by Oprah, so somewhere she picked up some truly mad skills.  What she lacks in compassion and discernment she more than makes up for in the introspective examination of a relatively uneventful life.  Her mother dies.  Her father left the family early.  She does some smack and likes sex.  Then she goes on a hike.  Oh please.
B002QP145C|3.0|Early on, they did cover the Finnish army's lack of equipment.  And, they also portrayed the Finns as pretty much the same as any good group of soldiers exposed to war for the first time.  I especially liked the march to the front with the singing and high morale.  The battle sequences were mostly shot at the same location, so it gets a bit monotonous.  But, the setting is beautiful and it does tell the story of out-manned and out-equipped Finns fighting the Red Army to a standstill.  If you love military history, you will find this film interesting.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very good story and very close to the actual events.  Enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend to friends.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|for horse lover's. it gives a nice introduction to care.<br /> this can be played at any age. the competitions make the game interesting.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|The DVD was delivered exactly on schedule.  This is a great old movie with practically an all-star cast - the oscar nominations were truly deserved.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  The remake with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly is a pale imitation of this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best. Free and the epi and I am not going on here to post a new one that has the epi the epi to see if you have a horse in h ago the epi the epic proportions to post your words
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was very entertaining and easy to play. Great graphics. Help button helps you go to each place you need to be. Would definitely recommend this game.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|everything about this movie is great.  i am a longtime fan of wes anderson and this does not disappoint.  every frame of this film is filled with a richness of detail that is hard to capture.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The Mitch Rapp series are always a good read! Vince Flynn does not disappoint with the newest Rapp and Kennedy series.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Tom Rob Smith has done a masterful job of keeping the reader from putting this book down. I applaud him for a job well down.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|you. can kill all kinds of monsters!You can also change your hero's armour. That's. why I'm giving it 5 stars
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book was truly awful. I have no idea what possessed anyone to compare it to Rowling or Tolkien, much less the amazing writing of George R. R. Martin. The charaters lack depth. The gay guys are evil. The plot is transparent and awkwardly written. It is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The 'noble' hero lacks insight and is immediately loved or hated by everyone. I kept hoping something would redeem it and maybe it was just an awkward starter but the whole thing was truly awful. Don't waste your time & money.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This book is an awesome read. A bit slow in the beginning but once you get into it you're hooked. It reminds me a lot of the storytelling in the movie &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34;. Scattered but entertaining and cohesive in its own twisted and dark way.
B001H1SVO8|3.0|I think this movie is overrated. It was fun but I didn't care about the characters and I was ready for it to be over an hour in
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game.  It has great graphics.  The horse looks real.  I play this game everyday.  I love horses!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Owning all three of this  wonderful series and have to say,this,the third series is as classy as the other two.<br />Downton Abbey makes compelling watching,the acting is first rate. The period costume is perfect as is the fine scenery whether inside or out, there is nothing to fault this fine period drama. Five stars say it all,perfect!
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I can't say enough good about Enya.<br /><br />The Celtic singer's best of has 24 songs on this mp3 album set.  It should also be mentioned that the mp3 version that Amazon offers has 5 more songs than the cd!<br /><br />If you're a fan, you're familiar with the vast majority of her hits from \\"Orinoco Flow\\" which has been remastered to the remastered, \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Caribbean Blue\\"<br /><br />But, how could you forget the love themes from Lord Of The Rings-- \\"Aniron\\" or \\"May It Be\\"  And, perhaps her best, \\"If I Could Be Where You Are.\\"<br /><br />This is, short of a boxed set, an indispensable collection of her very best and most popular.<br /><br />Enya is the benchmark of what great crossover Celtic music has been and what it should always be.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Though I cannot understand the language I still enjoy his voice. I wish he had a cd speaking English. Thanks
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is one of the very few movies my wife and I could sit down and enjoy together.  While the ending has what appears to be overinflated &#34;drama,&#34; in the credits the movie makers point out they did resort to drama in some cases.  Otherwise it looked very realistic and plausible.  Tony Mendez gets credits for being an advisor to the movie makers.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The price is right (FREE), and this app works well on my Kindle Fire (MUCH better than going to Facebook through a web browser), but it lacks the full functionality of the online version.
B007REV4T8|3.0|I have watched every single Bond movie and believe  the writing and special effects were a bit far fetched, almost farcical this time, albeit not as ridiculous as &#34;Moonraker.&#34;  Daniel Craig's acting and Judi are top notch.  If Bond WRITERS can stick more to drama, a more realistic and believable plot, beautiful enticing women, real world locations and &#34;reasonable but interesting&#34; special effects, Daniel Craig can carry the movie to truly top notch (unsurpassed) Bond entertainment again.  Any more detail about this movie would ruin it for people hoping to see it.  It is entertaining, but not up to standard with &#34;Thunderball,&#34; &#34;&#34;for Your Eyes Only,&#34; and &#34;Casino Royal.&#34;  I was almost hoping this would sequel from &#34;Quantam of Solice.&#34;
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is one of the greatest Sudoku apps that I have used.  I like the features and how it handles all the different aspects of the puzzle.  Super excited that I got it for free too!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a wow movie.  Great story line.  He had acting like an alcoholic down pat also.  I could swear he was really drinking in this movie.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This is the first time I have written a review, and I feel compelled to do so by the poor quality of this book. I am unsure how anybody can give more than one star to this juvenile, poorly written book. I could not make myself read beyond page 70 - poorly developed characters, no plot, bad grammar and spelling eg. \\"to peace throughout the Ring\\". \\"HERE HERE\\" came the chorus of shouts.<br />it was atrocious. I regret spending a single cent.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Great game and amazing graphics but the in game purchases are a little pricy and you need glu credits go get some items like rage positions plays you start out with barly any credits but it has great game play ant graphics u<br />You even get to slay dragons just glu has to be glu has to get its prices cheaper

B000K7VHQ4|3.0|but dvd skipped and we were a bit disappointed, maybe it was done during shipping but kinda ruined the mood when it jumped around in the plot.
B0095P33IW|4.0|very good and entertaining. recommend it to others who like this kind of movie . Entertainng and fun for the entire family
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very will done I thought. Enough information without being to graffic,He layed the story out so I could vizulize the seane .
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This movie doesn't make sense. There are so many moments of &#34;What!&#34; that at it's conclusion I was left wondering how the many people who gave this movie high marks were able to totally suspend all critical thinking ability. It's overproduced, under-though, base violence and explosions without any of the class or suave Bond I grew up with.
B007RI56NY|4.0|I'm a Train fan, and enjoyed the new album quite a bit. Danceable and easy to sing along to, which is great for when I'm doing housework and need some extra energy.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Where do I even start with Wool?<br /><br />Well, things I look for in things to read:<br />1. I want it to be well written. Check!<br />2. I want it to pull me in within the first few chapters. Check! (second or third chapter of the first novel.)<br />3. I want there to be enough to read to keep me occupied for a few days. Check!<br />4. Originality. Check! Many checks! Checks in droves!<br /><br />Additionally, I was very impressed with the originality of the entire thing. Great and wonderful read. Will suggest to my friends. Will read the Shift novels. In fact, I just finished wool <5 minutes ago, and I'm buying the Shift omnibus *right now.*<br /><br />Wool, for me, sits right up there with things like Ringworld and Lilith's Brood and Rant and Snow Crash.<br />Putting an author on that kind of pedestal, next to authors (and stories) of that caliber, is hard - but I think the man deserves it. Read Wool and decide for yourself.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I choose to read it after a short introduction by Amazon.  I appreciate very much the intro's by Amazon.. The children's comments through out the book were precious....

B004AM5QT4|4.0|I found it very interesting and kept me wanting to read on.  However, I felt once the plot was obvious, I lost some interest.  Granted it was near the end, but my keen interest was lost.  Over all a very good book, but conclusion a little drawn out.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|A terrific novel you will learn more about species that inhabit our planet and a new field of micro technology.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|Just what I need for my android tablet and it works great.<br />Thank you for having this product  Thank you
B006ZS4G24|5.0|My 8-year old granddaughter loves this Lego set.  I also purchased a few others and some extra green plates and she builds a complex with them.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Very unique style from this band. A friend turned me on to them, I love the music. It's different, but it's worth listening to.
B003L20IHE|2.0|I was a bit excited to see a performance of Zac Efron but only disappointment came to a point I did not finish watching this. Just didn't like the storyline at all!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Starting to find some new music that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out. I'm 62 years old, and most of the new music stinks these days. But Big Gal here has some talent, love the guitar parts. I'll buy more of their CDs for sure when they release them.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults!  We all loved the story and the cute monster characters.  My younger child didn't like the disappearing evil monster, but he did like the funny monsters and the story.  This is a great choice for a humorous, feel good movie.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Good to see this band make it to mainstream music. They deserve the attention, very good musicians. I'll be shopping for more of their music soon.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Excellent writing! Warm and loveable characters and WW II history from a new angle. It's so sad that we won't have another book from this author.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|good music, what's not to like about it? The movie was good as well, but George Clooney? Give me a break!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|the DVD and case were in great shape as well as the quality in viewing. i am not disappointed in my purchase, thanks Amazon!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I like that this isn't just one hidden object screen after another. There are puzzles and you need to go back and forth between scenes to accomplish various tasks. Nicely thought out game!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|i really loved the quality of this used item, the case and dvd both arrived in great shape, happpy and would recommend it!
B009439HEY|5.0|A major accomplishment with top of the line musicians really spells what you are in for. By far we all know this is nothing new but how its done. I do respect all of the people out there that think Gabriel and Collins are the only singers for these songs. But the arrangements are picture perfect! Every note, tone and sound are a carbin copy of the original songs! Hackett, as usual is perfect on the guitar with the stellar lineup behind him. The only song I was dissapointed with was The Return of the Giant Hogweed.Only because of the recent remake done by Transatlantic. The stand outs are Suppers Ready, Eleventh Earl of Mar, TheLamia... Oh faceit... Its all great. John Wetton was definitly the perfect choice for Afterglow. The sound quality is superb. Its like hearing Genesis on steroids. Great job Steve and I will see you in Philly in October!
0061336459|5.0|I didn't even realize I was in poverty and following in my grandmother and mother's soiled footsteps in handling finances until after reading this book. I thought of money as hard to come by and millions of dollars as impossible to attain because I never had it, never saw it, and was raised to believe it was a ridiculous goal to be wealthy. I, as the author suggested, bought 4 plastic jars from Walmart, labeled them savings, necessities, play, and give (he has one or two more accounts he gives but this is what is comfortable for me) and my finances have been significantly better ever since. The best part is, I don't have a negative or indifferent attitude towards money any more. Money and I are great friends and it is bringing a lot more friends to join us now; all because I changed my thought process by gettng to the root of the problem. You may not find the answers instantly (it takes a little soul searching and you may even have to ask your loved ones questions), but eventually you will wise up and see where your attitude has brought you. Buy it, you won't regret it.
B00AU2B0DE|4.0|I liked two of the new songs. he raincoat song I don't get. The rest was decent. It is a pretty typical bieber album
B007IXWKUK|3.0|More of the same, but the writing had a way of pulling the reader in. Making it addictive to read until the whole story was complete.  I read all of them in 6 days. I was appalled, surprised, giddy; many things went through my mind as I read this series.  It was an eye opener!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|Finally! A Doctor Who season without a slightly depressing, doomed from the start, romantic undertone. Donna 's character is pure genius. Catherine Tate brings a lightness to the show, and as we saw in her appearance in season 3, keeps the Doctor in check and challenges him as an equal, in a way neither Rose nor Martha ever did. They teach each other so much, heal each other without becoming codependant. Their friendship and banter is a joy to watch.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|I can't get the contents into the test tube I can't get any farther. Is there a fix I can get
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|While I don't dislike either of them, the 9th doctor isn't my favorite and Rose is far from my favorite companion. The show is still entertaining  but I prefer the latter seasons. Still worth watching if only to understand the next few seasons.
1936608898|4.0|I like the book, but I like Robb Wolf's better, his is an easier read and his allows red wine, tequilla and dark chocolate!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The Girl Who Waited, The Oncoming Storm, and The Last Centorian make my life with this series.  The action, and venture and genius humor make this one of my favorite seasons and without a doubt my favorite doctor. Love it!!!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this app.  It is improving my spacial memory. Makes my mind sharper and provide great way to spend time while waiting.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I thought it was for KIndle but it was not for mine, returned it but had to pay the postage
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Can't put it down.  Not at all what I expected but very interesting concept of time travel.  The aftermath of preventing the assassination was maybe a little far-fetched.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|great classic fantastic colors and sound. prime shipping is great! although one of the movies came out of the center hold no damage was done to the movie
B00BHMETKC|1.0|This movie was a snooze! I have no idea how Argo won the Oscar for picture of the year. I thought it was terribly boring. It was very anticlimactic and the characters were never developed enough to make you even care if they made it home or were taken captive in the airport (of course because it is based on a true story I am very happy they made it home unharmed!). I did not see anything Oscar worthy, or $4.99 rental fee worthy for that matter, in this movie. If you want to see an Oscar worthy movie see Les Miserables or Lincoln.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Glad I watched this last weekend prior to the Oscars.  Very entertaining!  Although I 'lived' this event while in college, I didn't really understand what had happened until I watched Argo.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me encanta el juego es adictivo puedo estar todo el dia jugandolo brutal contagioso para pasar el rato lo amo
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! Author does a good job of keeping you guessing which makes it hard to put down.  Definitely not your typical murder-mystery!
B002M9WW30|4.0|I could care less for these movies but my boyfriend loves them so I bought it for him for Christmas.  First movie we watched I noticed and heard sound effects never able to hear before.  My boyfriend is a happy camper too!  It also takes up less space.  This is a great surprise gift for any Rocky fan.
0141301104|5.0|The Witches is probably one of my favorite Roald Dahl books. It has somewhat of a morbid streak, but it is highly entertaining. The Witches, as you might have guessed, is about REAL WITCHES. The scene where the witches of England have their grand conference and plot the death of all children is particularly morbid. But let me back up. Our narrator is an unnamed little boy whose Norwegian grandmother tells him all about witches, who are determined to rid the world of children. She tells him how to recognize one, and to run the other way if you see a witch. But our young narrator gets caught in the middle of not one witch, not two witches, but the annual conference of all the country's witches! More ensues, ultimately with the narrator (though in slightly altered form) attempting to get rid of all the witches in one fell swoop.<br /><br />I've really been reading a lot of Roald Dahl lately, and I'm planning to read more. The great thing about his books is that they're so quick to get through, and so amusing to read.<br /><br />This is probably my third time reading The Witches and I noticed one really important new thing. The narrator of this story's family is Norwegian, and his grandmother, who takes care of him after his parents die in a car accident, regales him with stories about witches and other things. Roald Dahl himself was at least partly Norwegian, and though he grew up mainly in England and Wales, he went to Norway every summer for vacation. Some of the descriptions of fishing in Norway (though they never get to go in The Witches) must be based upon his own experiences. It was a nice touch that I hadn't noticed before.<br /><br />Roald Dahl seems to have an almost universal theme among his children's books: it's the kids vs. the grown ups and inevitably, the kids win. I think every kid loves to read about that, especially as it can be so different in the real world. Roald Dahl's creative genius is once again showcased in this marvelous book, full of evil witches and brave boys and one really smart grandmother.<br /><br />My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|This movie was just to gory for me.  I watched it because it has a story line different from anything I had ever seen and it was just to much for me.  Pretty people in the movie though, until there eyeballs are hanging out of there eye sockets.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really didn't think I'd like this show because I have no interest in zombies or this type of show, but once I watch the first episode I was hooked! Now I can't get enough of it!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|After going through (4) iPhone's (approx 1 a year or less I would drop them in water, beer, or crack the screen) I have finally kept one safe for over a year.  Although the case gets dirty & I have to take it off for the headphones to work (I misplaced the part that came with the case), my phone now survives being dropped on concrete, beer, the toilet (I am not the only one who has had these incidents) & many other tough moments.  I paid $90 for my case & it's a good investment.  The only thing is, it does not work with my car charger.  The benefits far outweigh the cons.<br /><br />--EDIT-- 9/2<br />I have now had my case for about a year and a half now and it the gray wrap-around part has began to come apart on the top right corner.  Even with it coming apart, I would still recommend this product because of the protection it has provided since I purchased it (and using my phone to take pictures at Seaworld while everybody else had to leave theirs behind was pretty cool).  Because the case has began to fall apart after a year and a half at $100 I think going to a 4 star instead of 5 is acceptable and fair.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot. The plot is fun and it allows for a lot of creativity. Levels are not repetitive and great for a wide age range. Only thing to improve would be more hints for those occasions when you get stuck.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|I do love these movies.  In some situations, the sequel is not as good as the first and that was not the case in this movie.  I stayed up way passed my bedtime to watch this.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Hands down best supernatural series I've seen. They come as close to reality as possible, great visual and tremendous acting from Jensen Ackles, Jared Padelecki, and supporting actors.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've always enjoyed Mahjong on my PC and now I can take it with me wherever I go! The colors are bright and the graphics are clear and pretty.
B0011Z7JO8|5.0|While I'm a staunch &#34;vinyl&#34; guy, I found that my old l.p. was missing from its jacket.  I really had a hankerin' for hearing those songs again, so I decided to download an mp3 version of it.  It sounds &#34;okay&#34; I suppose, .....maybe it's the compression,...I don't know, but I rated this a 5 Star anyways.  Not based on the format, but on the songs.  I'll find another vinyl album someday soon to hear the fidelity that was intended for this music, but in the meantime, the handiness of the Amazon digital offering was appreciated.
B000002GKT|5.0|Ok........it's 2013 and a lot of years are under the bridge.  There are many &#34;live albums&#34; that have been made.  It was commonplace for bands who were &#34;big sellers&#34; in the 1970s, to make a &#34;live&#34; album.  No studio time which means no studio costs.  The bands did a &#34;double dip&#34; of sorts:  They did a &#34;live gig&#34; that made them money and then the live album would make them even more money.<br /><br />All of this being said, how many live albums can you think of that have survived the test of time and have become CLASSICS?  I'm not talking about YOUR favorite group's live album....I'm talking about an album that has transcended time and over the many years, has made new fans?<br /><br />Perhaps you can add a few more but off the top of my head.........these albums are hard to argue with:<br /><br />The Who....Live at Leeds<br />Frampton Comes Alive<br /><br />and then there's Humble Pie's.........Rockin' the Fillmore.<br /><br />Steve Marriott who was the force behind the Small Faces which Rod Stewart made into Faces, Kenny Jones who left Faces and became the drummer for The Who after Keith Moon's untimely death, Peter Frampton who left the band and created the aforementioned  &#34;Frampton Comes Alive&#34;.  The Rockin' the Fillmore album created from it's humble beginnings (no pun intended).......other bands who created other iconic albums.  And yet, this album has slipped &#34;under the radar&#34; compared to these other albums.<br /><br />Too bad, Steve Marriott's &#34;gutsy&#34; vocals, Peter Frampton's guitar playing is a bit out of place as it's more jazzy than rock, but his rock chops were developed and finally refined with &#34;Come's Alive&#34;.<br /><br />Like others who have appreciated this vastly underrated album..........buy it!!!!!!!<br /><br />For $5.........you'll get more than your money's worth!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending. If this series could go on that would be amazing write another series Susanne Collins three more we ords

B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is very fun addicting and interesting. Even my 4year old<br />brother plays<br />it,but it is almost too addicting and changes a lot. The game is very fun but it didn't save my coins,score ,and multiplier.Here is the link......<br />[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00992CF6W|1.0|It was my fault thinking I could get it to work on my galaxy tablet from amazon appstore with gift card money, but on the right of my screen it says &#34;compatible with droid 2 global&#34; in a green box. I thought it was weird that itd be available for  my phone, but interested(while still thinking I could get it on my tablet). After buying I find that tablet does not support appstore and I can not play it on my phone.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would recommend this book to people that are looking for funny book I would give this book five stars because it was hilarious . I loved the book from the front to the back but the ending was not the best I hope there's going to be a next one
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a great story and I loved it I have recommended it to many of my friends and co workers!!! I could not stop reading it very engaging...hope to hear more from this author! I love my Kindle books arrive fast and the battery last a long time so I could read this book any where and comfortably.. The Night circus was such a good story with full and interesting characters I really loved the book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would definitely suggest this app to other ppl I really enjoy how after about 32 days from a new update their is another update where the theme changes its cool cuz I don't get bored of the same old same old thing like I do on other apps when thrusting change at all
B0072GPQ72|5.0|This is a great film. It doesn't feel the need to show excessive violence, or sexuality, as so many other &#34;war films,&#34; or films in general, do.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|The quality of the game is great. Gameplay is easy to grasp and it does a quick save for you when you turn your kindle off without saving first. It's just awesome!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Sometimes this app gets glitchey. Its really easy to get gems but it sometimes takes a while to load. Its hard to get money sometimes too.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall 007 is a great movie even if you never seen a James Bond movie before. It's very great in quality and story-line making this probably the best 007 movie yet
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I am not a country music fan at all but I am a big fan of the show Nashville.<br /><br />I caught myself singing some songs from the show days after I watched it.  I decided to purchase the CD and I like all but 2 songs.  I am sure if I was a country music lover, I would like these songs.  I have yet to hear all the songs on the CD performed on the show yet, but SEASON 1 still isn't over.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|I downloaded this app because I have an Anglo-Phile friend, and I thought I could harrass him by finding out news of England before he did. It works for me, so I'm happy with it. Now, if I could find an english paper that shows the Page 2 girls, I'd be a happy little camper...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game so much haha. i have this game on my ipod and so when i recievdd my kindle fire hd this was one of the first apps i downloaded and i am definetly not dissappointed :)
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. Good, quick, crunchy, ray-beam-go-boom, pulp sci-fi wrapped around a gooey center of big picture existential what-is-human philosophical questions. Read it NOW.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I saw the show in Houston and this album expresses her new sound.<br />Jazz with a new twist without loosing anything.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Yet another great album from Josh. I like the mix of songs. It's easy to listen to. I recommend that Josh fans purchase the CD.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Well on the kindle fire you cant record videos... :(  but with this app you can take pictures and record videos!!! ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is great fun. its so addictive and so fun to play!!!!  I love it and the second version too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I kept having  lower scores but now that I keep on  playing it and practicing I have bigger scores that's why I love it
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I like the characters a lot. Smart and witty. Sure, it may not portray the life of a lawyer realistically, but it is still entertaining.
B008220DGE|2.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is quite possibly one of the most overrated directors working today in Hollywood, sure he gets a lot of credit due to creating mostly mainstream drama films that they love to give awards to at the Oscars, but other than that, he isn't particularly innovative or talented when it comes to making films. His movies are filled with miserable, depressed, unhappy, people who are often searching for happiness or meaning in their lives, and his newest historical drama, The Master, is no exception. The Master follows a tortured soul named Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who despite being a supposed war veteran, actually looks more like a stroke victim, as he has an odd habit of talking out of one side of his mouth, and slurring his words, regardless of whether or not he's drunk. At the beginning and first half hour or so of the film he spends wandering aimlessly around the town or city in California where he lives, taking photographs of people, or harassing them and having sex with loose women. One night while intoxicated he finds his way on to a yacht owned by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a local leader of a philosophical movement called \\"The Cause\\" which seems a lot like the infamous celebrity religion Scientology, as has been noted by other reviewers. After attending the wedding of Dodd's daughter he undergoes \\"processing\\" to uncover past trauma, and afterwards becomes somewhat of Dodd's right hand man, attacking or intimidating those who disagree with the beliefs and methods of The Cause. One man in the film notes how the group seems an awful lot like a cult, as Dodd often gets very defensive and angry when his beliefs or motives are questioned by others. He seems outwardly calm and composed but whenever he is questioned about his sincerity and truthfulness he becomes a raging storm almost as crazy as Quell. I guess the message of this film is the idea, which has been done to death, by the way, that religion is no more than a cult that requires blind obedience, brainwashing, and deception and that the founders of religions are in fact crazed cult leaders who only truly desire servants or slaves who will obey them, hence the films's title The Master. The acting was pretty good all around, I will admit, there was a certain intensity in many scenes, and the cinematography was also quite good, there were many beautiful shots of beaches, neighborhoods, and a desert, but that wasn't nearly enough. Quell's character wasn't very likable, but he was sympathetic, and most of the other characters such as Peggy (Amy Adams) and Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers), with the exception of Dodd, were also sympathetic, but it takes more than dozens of miserable, brainwashed characters you can sympathize with to make a good film. I understand that religions and people like Dodd and Quell do exist in real life and it is in fact very tragic what happens to many of these people but overall many of the themes and messages this films has are pretty obvious and well known, many religious people are in fact angry and miserable, but it's not like it's any big revelation. Any person who knows enough about organized religions such as Islam and Mormonism, knows that people like this exist and are attracted to belief systems like this. The fact that Anderson thought it was a good plot for a feature film often seems as though he believes most people are unaware or too stupid to realize this, and in effect it almost feels as though he is underestimating or insulting our intelligence. That definitely takes alot away from the quality of the film. Also, one last thing. Much of the dialogue and content of the film seemed out of place for it being the post world war 2 era. There are many unnecessary sex scenes, nudity, and crude dialogue scattered throughout, not to mention very strong, crude language, isn't this supposed to be the \\"good old days\\" when people were more decent and civilized, yet these characters, aside from the clothes and technology, seem like the kind of people you might meet in any given town in America nowadays in the 21st century! A disappointment all around.logy, seem like the kind of people you might meet in any given town in America nowadays in the 21st century! A disappointment all around.
B0063IH60K|3.0|the second day I had my new Kindell I turned it on and it wouldn't boot up.  I paid big bucks for the Kindell Fire 8.9 32GB and I am very unhappy so far.  I purchased it at Staples and they are replacing it as soon as a new one comes in but the warranty and the unit have to be re-registered and this all takes time, NOT A GOOD START !!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Ok, this game was okay. I really think that the server should get fixed so it doesn't take 20 minutes to load. Maybe they could make it a bit more realistic also. Otherwise great game!
630587493X|5.0|Bicentennial man is a tear jerker a must see. I recommend it to all. This one is robin Williams best.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love the game but in world 3 i can't even play because he dies right away for no reason
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Finally it's here and it took me awhile to make the review because I was too busy playing the game.. this sequel has alot of amazing graphics and they really tried to make it realistic which did really work. Overall, AWESOME game!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Super and essential app, easy to see and easy to use. Only improvements i can think of would be nice if could change view orientation (locked into portrait now) and would be great if could bring up app while doing another function (say, writing a note to solve an equation..nice if could open calculator while in other app.)  Otherwise, great app.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Rarely does one read a bad review of a RT album.But I must say this disc is great,but it and will not be disappointed.My tastes range from the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club to Nick Drake yet I have had trouble from removing this from my daily rotation.Buy It.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|This is a great book and it brings light to new thinking about selling.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading it. Daniel did a fantastic job once again and it came in the right time as we are working on a new sales pitch for our company.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />Yiannis
B008X6N1OA|5.0|I really loved this movie. My whole family loved it! It was hilarious and I don't mind watching over and over again!
B007L5GDGW|2.0|I like that one of the screenshots actually shows you failing at this game. Because fail you will. This game desperately needs a tuning up for difficulty or some other options in terms of difficulty or at least adjustable speeds/tilt sensitivity. Until then, I don't think it's ready for primetime. The 1 extra star was for the graphics which aren't that bad for a mobile game. But the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was very disappointed in this one. My expectations were high since Pride and Prejudice was such an excellent movie.
B001B51B9M|5.0|NOt much to say here except this is compulsory for all lovers of musicals on film. Maybe Robert Preston is a tad too old ... but so am I !
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good read. I've never read a Nicholas Sparks book, but it definitely pulled at my heart strings. I've seen previews for the movie and they already messed it up. So read the book, it is more realistic than the movie appears to be in the preview.
1449408656|3.0|...but not quite as entertaining as I had hoped.  I got it as a gift for a cat-loving friend who says she has enjoyed it.
B00821OW8K|4.0|I didn't want to watch it because I thought the fact they fight aliens was pretty stupid but once you get over that it really is a pretty decent show. I really like Red Dawn, and thought the story line from the game Homefront was really cool and this is kind of like that, in the way of following the fights of a resistance. If your a science fiction fan or not this show is really worth checking out. Keep in mind though, like many shows the first few episodes will move pretty slow but, it picks up pretty good towards the end of the second or third episode.
B003XYERRM|5.0|Only this one, although all of Penman's books are on the &#34;I've read this way more than once&#34; list.  She does a lot of research and then spins it into an engaging story.  I am almost at the end now, I know Richard is going to die.  I have not only read the book, but I love history and this late medieval/early modern period is my favorite.  I know he is going to die.  I slow down my reading because I know I am going to cry when he dies.  Cry, over a book I have read 6 times, over a man who has been dead over 600 years.....................Sharon Penman does nice work.
B00498YZH8|5.0|After playing Bill Engvall's teen age daughter for 3 seasons on television, Jennifer Lawrence became one of our youngest Academy Award nominees (she was 20) as Best Actress with her outstanding performance in &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;.  She plays the oldest child of a family whose father has disappeared and whose mother is not there, mentally. Her father put up the house and land to pay his bail and now he has endangered his family by not showing up in court.  If Ree cannot find him or find proof he is dead, she and her mother and two younger siblings will have no where to live.<br /><br />As Ree searches for him and encounters people who she knows have information but won't share it with her, we see Jennifer Lawrence light up the screen with an emotional intensity usually seen in older, more established actresses.<br /><br />Not since &#34;Deliverance&#34; has the poverty of southern Appalachia been so well displayed on the motion picture screen. Check it out if you have any doubts Jennifer Lawrence has now become one of our finest actresses.
B003A3K3JW|5.0|I'm a little behind getting to this disc. After being so disappointed with Dudamel's Tchaikovsky (Romeo & Juliet/Hamlet) CD, this one went to the bottom of the pile. But it is surely one of the very best Rite of Springs ever, and certainly Dudamel's very best disc so far.<br /><br />Since this has been so generously reviewed here on Amazon, I will keep this brief. Suffice it to say, I was completely bowled over by this performance. No, it is not the most powerful version ever, but it is the most imaginative and colorful I've ever heard. It is full of atmosphere and detail and orchestral colors. And don't take that to mean it is therefore slow and boring like Dudamel's Tchaikovsky is. This is energetic, often very fast and absolutely thrilling. The Sacraficial Dance is surely the fastest on record.<br /><br />And it is all superbly played. Listening to this blind, I'd pronounce this the best orchestra in the world!  What you can hear is that these players still care. They haven't played it a thousand times and aren't just going through the motions like so many of our professional orchestras do. They absolutely care and play brilliantly for their conductor, who has never produced a more inspired and exciting performance. DG's recording is also excellent - colorful, atmospheric, and with generous wallops from the very powerful bass drum. This is just sensational in every way.  Oh, and the Revueltas is good too, but it is the Stravsinky that blew me away.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|If anybody would have told me I would be listening to &#34;Tammy Taylor&#34; from Friday NIght<br />Lights singing country music I would have laughed hysterically. I don't even listen to<br />country music but I am hooked on this show and the music on this show. I am so glad I<br />was able to purchase it and put in on my MP3.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book is a fast read. At first you feel like it is a take on &#34;50 First Dates&#34;, but then it takes on a whole different feel.  Very enjoyable and an ending I never expected.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Love this. I saved my pictures on this. I would recommend this to my friends every day of the week!
B0000024YL|5.0|I want to replace many of my old LP's with CD's so I can put them on my iPod. Buying the CD was way cheaper than ordering songs from iTunes. It's s so nice to hear the pure harmony of Simon and Garfunkel again!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Super. I would love to upload my own photos and play the puzzle with them. I will buy it, worth the money 100%

B001HN69AY|5.0|Great story. Interesting segways from Ledger to the other actors that take on and over his part after his untimely demise.  Loved the special effects, and the story line is intriguing.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use, works well. Very customizable and easy to set up. Has a countdown timer also. And it actually wakes me up!!!!
B001HN694K|5.0|Great version of this iconic classic. Special effects, casting all stellar.  Helena Bonhem Carter is a scene stealer.  Highly recommended.

B001ANYDAO|4.0|As a doctoral student, I was assigned this book.  I now begin to analyze how it can be used for educators as they delve deeper into student and staff conversations.  How can we use this knowledge to lift up students who we would otherwise put down and ignore?
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Beautiful story and visuals. Emilie Hirsch brought Chris McCandless alive, and the ideas shared in the movie are universal and relevant.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series even though it has some very shockingly sad parts ...for the most part ...I enjoy it very much!!!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I purchased the case mostly to protect my beloved Legend, which I use every day to listen to podcasts on my phone while working out and to talk hands-free when driving. I was always worried I would damage or lose the earpiece, and I used it so much that I had to recharge it every night.<br /><br />The case not only protects my Legend, but I only have to recharge the case with my laptop about once a week. It's much more convenient, and my Legend is protected and always charged.
1781164150|5.0|Kick Ass book showing the making and character development from start to finish. Beautiful sketches and renderings of the characters and scene settings. Just as good as the movie if not better. A top &#34;Art in the Making&#34; hardcover book that is a must for every fan of animation and art enthusiast.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'm not known for giving out book reviews but I can't stand not sharing my opinion on how much I adore Rebecca Hamilton's The Forever Girl. This is the first book I read from her and is definitely not the last.<br /><br />I don't really remember how I stumbled upon this book, all I know is that it definitely had me obsessed! Becca gave me a copy of this book all because I was so eager to read it after learning it was about witches! In my own opinion, I consider a book good when it makes me pause for a second and breathe. I get caught up in the scenes of this book that when I finished reading it, I don't know what to do with my life anymore.<br /><br />Anyways, every turn of events gave me the chills all because the plot and character development is brilliantly written! What I love about our heroine Sophia, a witch, is that she isn't a weak little girl who depends on her boyfriend for everything (sound familiar, yes?) She's independent and strong even if she questions her decisions later on. I mean, with her situation, who wouldn't.<br /><br />It all started when she couldn't find the cure to keep the voices in her head down. Her friend, Ivory insisted that she goes to the club with her to simply have fun (and meet Adrian, whom she seeks for help with her problem) and that's where she meets Charles... and things were never the same.<br /><br />I don't wanna spoil you guys too much because I can go on and on. Yes, she falls for Charles, a (very handsome) vampire... but you will be surprised how the author managed to weave in two different supernatural elements together without compromising the story's essence.<br /><br />I am honestly tired of reading vampire fiction novels since they happen to be all the range these days. But The Forever Girl is an exception to that. Becca did a great job for keeping me interested in turning the pages with its twists up to the very end. Her writing style pulled me right into the world of vampires and witches and all things supernatural..<br /><br />Awesome read Becca! I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series!al..<br /><br />Awesome read Becca! I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it! Everything about this game is so fun! My favorite part is the different characters! I love Frank. The Rome world tour stop is great but the Rio one was good but not VERY good
B008G3N71W|5.0|It is hard to find eloquent words to describe my feelings and say how much I loved A Girl's Adventure. Chloe Thurlow writes mesmerizing erotica that touches all the right buttons and can be enjoyed by men as well as women - that is certainly the case for my husband and I. Anyone who isn't a fan of Ms. Thurlow doesn't know what they are missing. A note to American readers: Chloe Thurlow is British and story contains British English, an enjoyable departure from your typical read.
0470913029|4.0|Great book very informative about the diet, how and why it works.  Would recommend it to anyone looking at this way of life.

B0056CUZRA|2.0|Was very disappointed with this book as I always enjoy Ken Folletts books I liked some chapters but the rest were hard to understand and too much of political reading which I found very hard to understand

B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I had to read this book in high school 30 years ago.  I remember it as one of my favorite books.  Just saw it come up on sale so I bought it for my kindle.  I couldn't puny it down a read it in two days.<br /><br />The books keeps you guessing.  Very interesting.  Worth reading.
1616550414|5.0|This book will tell you a great deal about the zelda series and has wonderful artwork. It's the need to know for any LoZ gamer.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Simple and works well.  Has a timer too, which I find really helpful when<br />I am trying to save battery.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Great cinematography, novel use of cgi, good acting, good direction.  The portion edited out of the film was shown after the credits - it should have been included in the body of work.  Worth the rental fee if you're a scifi fan.
B008M721MS|3.0|The video calling is very, very poor.  The picture is horrible.<br />Instant messaging works fine though.  I wouldn't recommend Skype for kindle for video calling.
B00821OX98|5.0|5 stars from great drama with a main plot of SCI FI. Survival is the name fo the game I think more people shuld relate to survival instinct to stay prepared for any contingency
B0051MKNV8|4.0|It's a good movie, that's why I bought it. I only give it 4 stars because it had a couple scratches. It plays fine though
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 2 year old loves this game!! She calls it sub surfer! Lol ! I love it too but for some reason it want connect to fb and I can't update it or I just don't know how to on her kindle fire he! Can someone help me?
B0055MBQOM|5.0|The ColorMunki is very easy & quick to use -- just follow the on-screen prompts.  I would recommend this device for any amateur photographer.  I now allow Lightroom 4 control color management rather than the printer.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Amazing voice. Love this CD. So many beautiful songs. Clown is incredibly haunting and moving. I would recommend to everyone
1423136802|5.0|Need we say more.  Percy Jackson is a must read!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this edition does have frequent spelling and grammatical errors (an estimated dozen per book).  The price is exceptional though, so it is easy to overlook some of these mistakes.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie ws very engrossing...even though I knew the basic story about the six being rescued,...Ioved the background and details of the story.  The scenes at the airport had you on the edge of your seat!  Too much of the F word for me.  Maybe that is how they really talked...but I find that word totally offensive and if it is true then it is sad that supposedly highly educated and sophisticated people in government cannot come up with better words to express themselves.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|So glad to have this DVD. It is a favorite of ours so we had it taped from the television, now... NO more comercials.The story is great and so is the music. It is a little sad and it is not a fast paced movie but, it's the kind of movie you can watch over and over.
B000002KAT|1.0|I have a vinyl record of Van Morrison's Astral Weeks.  It is a wonderful collection of Van Morrisons early recordings. and I truly recommend this music.  However, the CD is one of, if not, the worst mastering job I've heard.  I listened to the CD on two very high end systems and both sounded the same....terrible.  The mixer mixed all the music out and amplified Van Morrison's vocal to a screeching lever that makes it impossible to hear any back ground music.  The back ground music is totally necessary to enjoy the full Astral Weeks experience.  I have a cassette made on a home system from a vinyl record that sounds many times better then this CD.  Its so sad because Astral Weeks is some great music.
B008M721MS|5.0|best app out there if you want to talk to to people all over the place and see them and its free
B004XUMMFE|5.0|So sad that it wasn't continued. I love this show and the character development, the more realistic take and the stories.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|The scenes in the airplane are about as nail-biting-exciting as you can get but, in reality, this is not a movie about an airplane.  It goes much deeper than that and delves into one aspect of the human condition.  I found it to be an excellent movie, with Denzel doing a superlative job as he seems to always do.<br />The DVD has an excellent widescreen picture and the sound is also quite good.<br />I am glad I purchased this item, and would do so again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was so action packed and entertaining that I can't wait to start the second book! Everyone should read this trilogy
B00007BKVC|4.0|A classic, although far-fetched movie.  I can't imagine anyone doing what they end up doing, but it is an entertaining movie none the less.<br />The disc has some very interesting extras that were informative and also entertaining.<br />The DVD picture quality in very good in widescreen as is the sound.<br />I am glad I purchased this item and would do so again.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Very good movie which is rare anymore. Kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! Highly recommended ...

0756655307|5.0|Awesome book for Marvel fans to have in their collection. Bought this as a birthday present for my 12 year old son who is obsessed with Marvel comics and movies and 6 months later he is still carrying it around studying every word. He enjoys learning all of the facts about the different characters. Shipping was faster than expected even though the book was on back order. Very pleased w/transaction.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|An engagingly funny book which also takes us on ride through history as we follow the life of Allan and some of the interesting characters he meets along the way.  I enjoyed the author's portrayal of this man as one who, despite his 100 years, still had enthusiasm for, and an interest in, living.  Any wonder he wanted out of the Old Folks Home!
B009X615A6|5.0|Love the entire CD. I don't buy CD's often but this one was a must buy. My favorite song-Hello-featuring Celo.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|Really fun, challenging levels that make you think in complex ways to get 3 stars! Frustrating sometimes but a great time killer
1616550414|5.0|I really didn't know if this was worth getting at first. I thought about just getting the Japanese version because I worry about things being lost in the translation, also I was worried they would leave some out of the English version.<br /><br />The cover is a lot nicer than I thought it would be, there are a lot of great colored pages on the inside with notes about all the designs and sketches. Interesting though that the notes are not made by those who did the original designs, so I do wonder if these comments were added to the english, or if the Japanese version also has them, and also who wrote them and why?<br /><br />I haven't read all of the Japanese version but the translation seems very solid.<br /><br />As a fan of the Zelda games I think this book is a must have, has it has so much extra information about each game and now that I have it I like this cover better than the Japanese version. It's very green! Like Link! ^^
0441013597|5.0|This was just the present for a brother-in-law for whom it is tough to shop. Dune is exceptionally hard to find and I was very pleased with this copy. The cherry on top: he enjoyed the book.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|It's always a great sign when you laugh out loud while reading a book. Real in so many ways. A great read.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I was a fan from day 1! This season did not let me down. I know the end is coming and will be disappointed when it comes.
B005SQ3AI0|1.0|I'd give zero stars if that was an option. I received this yesterday and put disk three on last night. Imagine my surprise to discover that the audio transfer (presumably from LP to digital input) is defective. Massively defective. The entire album \\"What a Difference a Day Makes\\" (the first 12 tracks on disk 3) the album and disk I put in last night, leaves out Dinah's voice track! Nothing. Nada. It's easy to see what happened. The sound engineer for the transfer only fed the \\"orchestra track\\" (the left track in the LP) and forgot to feed the \\"voice track\\" (the right track on the LP) to his digital storage system. When you listen to the CD as now issued, you get the left track (the music only) on both the right and left speakers, with Dinah's voice only being heard very very faintly in the background, almost imperceptible, since her microphone feed was not included in the transfer. All you are hearing is her voice being picked up in the distance from one of the orchestra track mikes, with her own mike feed not being included. This is what one or more other reviewers on Amazon call \\"including tracks that do not have Dinah on them,\\" but they are wrong. Dinah is (or was) in these performances, but she is now unhearable, a faint sound buried in the distance, since her voice track was left out of the transfer! An unforgiveable, inexcusable defect in the transfer. It's almost unbelieveable that no one at MusicMelon/Real Gone/101 would have listened to this transfer and not detected the glaring error before pressing and selling a couple thousand CDs from the defective master. Just disgraceful. But these transfers were obviously a quickie project strictly to take the money and run, and to heck with the listener. (FYI: I tried going to the company web site to report this, but the web site doesn't exist. Just an empty, blank page at the url where it is supposed to be. It figures.) Buyer beware.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've read. It was full of emotion. The entire book was a hook and I didn't want to quit reading it.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|[[ASIN:0679600175 The Sound and the Fury: The Corrected Text with Faulkner's Appendix (Modern Library)]][[ASIN:0783225849 Psycho (Collector's Edition)]][[ASIN:B000GVTNHE Psycho]][[ASIN:B000ICXQXI Psycho (1960)]]Many consider William Faulkner's novel 'The Sound and the Fury' to be THE Greatest American Novel. I concur with them. But you must read that book more than once to appreciate what Faulkner was really trying to do as he portrayed a southern family in turmoil and a South that was still trying to bring itself out of the wreckage, both physical and political, of the Civil War. I believe that 'Psycho' may well be THE Greatest American Movie, and could easily have been titled \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" as well. Hitchcock struggled to make this movie. He teetered on the edge of financial ruin and put his career and reputation on the line. Fighting battles with the Hollywood production company and the censors and putting up the $800,000 to produce ,the movie took a lot out of Hitch. But there was a determination to film this story of a psychopath and a confused,beautiful, love stricken woman whose unavoidable destiny was to stumble into his world. It took the application of Bernard Herman's unforgettable ,and now very famous, score to get the pre-viewing critics to put their stamp of approval on the film. Shot in the all too appropriate black and white, \\"Psycho\\" would ultimately gross over $40,000,000  and become Hitchcock's signature movie. The music delivers the opening jolt as it accompanies the movie's title and opening credits. The actors' names are slashed and divided as violins(violence?) screech harshly and thin lines of black and white criss cross the screen, all of this designed to warn us of the sharpness and movement of the weapon that will be used as well as the  upcoming clash between good and evil .  This theme of division by thin piercing objects permeates the movie. We see one in the form of what appears to be a radio tower as the viewer is shown theurban panorama of Phoenix on a hot after noon. As the camera pans from left to right, it brings  us ever closer to  our first view of Marion Crane. The tower completely divides the sky and horizon. Just as the camera passes it we are suddenly accelerated forward and things become a shade darker. This abrupt change in depth and light is classic Hitchcock,giving the viewer a sense of being propelled into the  series of macabre events that are about to unfold. Next we are taken through a hotel window, partially open on this hot Arizona afternoon. The characters in the room are also classic Hitchcock as he loved to match vivacious blonde actresses with tall, dark and handsome males . Here we see Janet Leigh playing the role of Marion Crane who is laying on the bed in post  love making afterglow. Her lover , Sam, is in town for business and, more importantly, a rendezvous with Marion.. They are in a sleazy, darkened , pay by the hour  hotel room, having just finished their \\"lunch hour\\" with the menu featuring clandestine sex while Marion's lunch remains uneaten on the nightstand . Good versus evil comes into play right from the start as Crane's concern is immediately disclosed. She announces to  Sam that she wants 'respectability' in their relationship, a.k.a. marriage.  She wants more from Sam, not just sex in cheap hotels as she hints at the type of woman who typically does such a thing. \\"I pay too\\", she says as her lover opens the blind  and seemingly submits to her demands. Thus we  see the good side of Marion Crane as she demands that the  affair that they are having end in favor of a more traditional relationship and ultimate marriage. But she is reminded by her man, Sam, that he hasn't the means to support her in style. The evil of money now clashes with Marion's resolve to be proper with her behaviour  .For the moment, she assures him that she doesn't care about where she lives or how much money they have, as long as marriage takes the place of sneaking around.But she does care and ultimately succumbs to temptation and sin upon returning to work that afternoon.<br />  We see Crane enter a real estate office she has worked in for 10 years. As she opens the door, we see Hitchcock sign the film with his traditional cameo appearance, this time standing outside of the office, framed by the large office window. When we see her boss enter a few minutes later with a drunken client in tow, Hitchcock is gone, the signature on the film complete. This became a tradition for Hitchcock and it is fun to try to identify him as he does it in a variety of clever ways in each movie.  The drunken client becomes an embarassment to Marion's boss who pleads with him to come into his office because it is air conditioned. But the client is not bothered by the heat and is much more interested in flirting with Crane and flaunting the $40,000 in cash that he waves around. Indeed this character, could well be the devil himself, with his mustached, drunken face in a nearly constant devilish grin. Within minutes he has disclosed himself as a tax evading, Las Vegas loving, sex fiend as he tries to lure the beuatiful Marion into his lair with a trip to Las Vegas. He makes the claim that he is using the money to \\"buy off unhappiness\\", by giving his 18 year old daughter a new home for a wedding gift. To him, this is the preferred option as opposed to having his daughter and mate earn their first home. Marion is clearly turned off by his advances and grotesque display of untaxed cash. After all, she has just left her lover, a man who seems to fly by the staight and narrow by working hard, paying his alimony and agreeing to her demands to be married in order to continue their love affair. She is relieved when this drunken blow hard is finally lured into the boss's office, not because of the air conditioning, which. of course, would not be appealing to the devil, but by the promise of more alcohol. She is asked by her boss to get the money out of the office forthe weekend by depositing it in the bank's safety deposit box. Thus the stage is set as she now has in hand a large amount of cash, a weekend off ahead of her , and a lover in eastern California that she can now be with if she is bold enough to leave town with money provided by a man she despises.She is about to buy off unhappiness. Or so she believes. As we have already learned, she has a conscience that will soon cause a disturbing emotional conflict.<br />  At home, we see her packing and we see through her body language evidence for second thoughts about her intention to take the money and run. The money lies in a large white envelope on her bed. What to do? What to do? She truly has the proverbial angel on one shoulder and devil on the other. But her mind was made up when she left the office and to Marion, there is no turning back now, and no significant feelings of remorse....yet.<br /> As she drives into the night she stops due to fatigue and we see her parked by the road in a desolate stretch of highway in eastern California. As if it has pierced the front of her car , we once again see a linear  vertical object, this time a telephone pole, hinting at the fateful event soon to occur. The journey then continues and we start to see fear creep into her mind, a fear that is worsened by the state trooper that woke her from her roadside slumber . Her distress visibly escalates as the trooper makes it clear that he senses that something is \\"wrong\\". Finally , he lets her go, but only temporarily as we see him arrive at the used car dealership that Marion stops at. The paranoia that develops overwhelms her as we see her buy a newspaper to see if her crime has made the news and  hurriedly buys a  used car with California plates. She then makes an error on a second night of driving, this time in pouring rain. Clearly we see that night driving does not agree with her and now she has accidentally gotten on the 'old road' to Fairview, the town where Sam lives. As she arrives at her unfortunate destination, the Bates Hotel, she stops for the night, not realizing that she is only 15 miles away from Fairview, Sam, and safety.<br />  After all, she is exhausted and wants sleep,food, and.......a shower. It is here that we are introduced to the social deviate who gives the film it's name. The hotel is empty because of a new bypass highway, the one Crane misses seeing, blinded by oncoming car lights, a deluge of rain and overwhelming fatigue. Behind the hotel lurks the classic Victorian house, creepy beyond imagination. There is no one in the hotel office and she honks her horn. A shadowy figure appears in a lit window of the house then disappears . Shortly thereafter we finally meet Bates. Norman Bates.<br />  He greets Crane and appears charming, hospitable and at first, normal(Norman?). But he is the \\"Psycho\\" who will stop at nothing to protect the image of his mother by both  incorporating her spirit into his own body and preserving something so shocking that I would ruin the film's greatest surprise by revealing it here. The name Norman Bates may also have been intentionally picked by the author of the novel that the movie is based on. For if you pronounce Bates backwards....Setab..... you get a word that sounds like stab.  We are then shocked into a state of  extraordinary fright as the film's most famous, and goriest, scene unfolds in Crane's bathroom in cabin #1...right next to the office. It is too bad that she did not pick up on the major clue that this man is very dangerous. She does notice the stuffed birds in the parlor that Bates lures her into in order to 'stuff' her with food he has prepared. It is an established fact that serial killers often start off by killing animals, sometimes as early as childhood. Bates admits that this is more than a hobby. Crane(a type of bird,by the way)acknowledges this and then becomes concerned about his obvious social isolation. Bates tells her 'You eat like a bird\\". But she fails to put itall together and, instead of taking a shower, jump into her car and travel the mere 15 miles to Fairview and the safety of Sam. Why does she fail? Is it her fatigue? Or is it the fact that she reconsiders her crime while eating in Norman's parlor and does not want to go on to Fairview. She does hint at her intention to right a wrong she has committed while talking  to Bates. The angel on her shoulder may well have doomed her. The devil, on the other shoulder is the clear winner in Marion's case.<br />  The shower ends prematurely. The story continues though  as people who are aware of Marion's absence and associated crime arrive in Fairview, knowing that Sam is there. The evil that starts with the $40,000 and the character that buys off unhappiness propels them all into the evil of Bates' world. Who will triumph? Are there really any winners? Does good just cancel out bad or does it go further and prevail? Lives will be lost before the movie ends. And another gruesome scene occurs in the basement of Bate's house  that may  frighten the viewer as much, or even more than the one that takes place in cabin  #1's bathroom. In the end, the devil is back in his lair, hell in the form of a prison cell.  The occupant's sardonic grin reveals the lurking evil within, belying the words \\"I wouldn't even hurt a fly\\".  You can watch Psycho for the sheer terror and, hence, thrill of it.You don't have to dissect the movie as I have tried to do here to appreciate the obvious horrific events that occur. At the very least , you will feel the terror. But watch it again and again so that you can appreciate the intricacies and subtle, but powerful suggestions and metaphors. Perhaps you'll see why this movie  is Hitchcock's, and perhaps America's, finest picture ever.  It is the same with Faulkner's book 'The Sound and the Fury'. One reading will give you the general idea. Several more will reveal details that make the story truly remarkeable.[[ASIN:073662922X The Sound and the Fury]]
1741791529|4.0|I bought this guide and used it to help me plan my trip to Iran, which I've just come back from. I can say without a doubt that the book is useful, but beware: Lonely Planet has a reputation of writing mostly for the low-budget / backpacker kind of traveler and for overlooking other reliable choices. In that sense, this guide in particular follows the same pattern: several of their Top Choices, once inspected, became my \\"Not-Top-Choices\\".<br />Iran offers a wide range of accomodation and places to eat, hang out and visit. It's also very, very cheap: a very good meal at a traditional Iranian restaurant, including tips, desert and tea will cost you no more than USD$15 for TWO people. Good, spotless 3-star hotels will cost you maybe USD$25-30. So, unless your budget is really tight there's no need to only look at youth hostels to save a few bucks.<br />Case in point: The Silk Road Hotel in Yazd, LP's Top Choice for the city is dirty, hot, unkept and has flies all over the place. The Kohan Hotel (not their top choice, but mine)is also traditional and it's absolutely spotless, cool, no flies, with a very decent restaurant and friendly service. It's the same with other cities. In fact, I went with one of their choices (the Atlas Hotel in Tehran) and it was terrible. Except for the staff, who were great, the hotel was a disaster.<br />However, I did use the hotels listed to go online and do some research, and that was how I found the rest of my accomodation in the country. So if nothing else, you at least have some useful guidance on where to look. Some of the email addresses and websites mentioned in the LP do not work, though, so you'll have to persist and keep looking.<br />The prices are also out-of-date but that's because of the exchange rate now really favors tourists, which wwasn't the case when the book was published.<br />The maps vary in quality: some are very accurate and easy to follow and some are not, but they mostly get the job done of taking you where you need to go. I used them in combination with directions from locals and I never got lost.<br />One thing that I thought was useful was that the names of sights are both in English and Farsi; since many Iranians don't speak English, when asking for directions I would sometimes show them the name in Farsi and they immediately were able to help me.<br />The section in the back which describes Iranian history and way of life is accurate and fun to read, and the intro with the Top 15 experiences in Iran was spot on: I managed to experience 10 and they were all absolutely fantastic (especially true of #1: Meeting the people).<br />Overall, it's a decent guide book with some inaccuracies which won't kill you and some features that are useful. If you use it blindly you'll end up regretting some choices but if you use the information to keep looking you'll make very rewarding ones.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|My dad was always a big fan of the Indiana Jones movies, and had originally owned the first three on VHS.  However, he gave his VHS tapes to my brother some years ago, and since then he has of course moved past watching movies on a VCR.  I purchased this blu-ray edition of the entire Indiana Jones collection for my dad's birthday , and he LOVED it.  The extra footage is a great bonus, but the movies themselves make this worth every penny of the purchase price!
B009K0P10K|5.0|But they rarely are...how do you top that?  Wish they would get back to more of the &#34;payback&#34; for her dad...getting a bit too soap opera ish...

B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book. I honestly couldn't put it down while I was reading it.  However, I really did not like the end AT ALL.<br /><br />So, 99% a great read.
1612191290|5.0|This well researched and well written tome is a fascinating read.  David Graeber takes on the large and complex topic of how the concept of 'debt' is inextricably intertwined with the development not only of commerce but also religion - many of the fundamental words for 'sin' are also the same word for debt.<br /><br />In addition, the book gives and interesting survey of different cultures around the globe, their approach to community, commerce, debt, and money. . . and the answers are often surprising.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I have read in a long, long, time.  I recommend it highly.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|I'm always amazed when I read music reviews.  Whether it's negative or positive, people have a tendency to wax endlessly in a literary criticism sort of way...metaphors, analogies...the list goes on.  Personally I think language is inherently limited when it comes to translating the feelings one gets when one listens.  So, in keeping with this belief, if you will, let me just say here that this is one of the best releases I've heard in quite some time.  Just one individuals opinion, mind you.
B005LAII3U|2.0|This version of Total Recall is great for special effects.  Not good on story line.  The original gave more history of what was going on and the new movie just dumps you into the middle of something (haven't figured out what yet).  I wish this movie had used the old story line but with the new special effects.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Not great, but a good read none the less. These are starting to follow almost the same thread in the newer stories.

B001OGRGWE|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who enjoys alternative music, this ablum is from the era when alternative was just breaking ground.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Domestic violence not erotica. I'm open minded but this did nothing for me. Shallow character development that I do not feel was based on their mysterious pasts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is awesome! My 6 year old grabs my kindle or phone and plays it. It as well. Sometimes more then I do.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book. I love to sit around and swap stories with others and reading this book felt like I was doing that with Chris. It's a great life story about a great American hero.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Solid story with good characterization. At times, the family's trials were a little hard to read about... these are miserable people. But that's a sign of good writing - you're supposed to be uncomfortable.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Truly learned to appreciate the difficulty people who are mentally ill may have returning to society and functioning in an acceptable fashion. Silver linings made me smile.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got this after all the hype and was extremely disappointed. finally stopped reading after almost throwing my kindle across the room. I would prefer to never read the words &#34;Inner Goddess&#34; ever again.
B0072N4PD6|5.0|so far this book is truly teaching me how to connect with my higher self...i love this book and plan to read it over and over again :-)
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I was expecting catchy music and dancing like the movie &#34;Nightmare before Xmas,&#34; which it didn't have; features that definitely hold one's interest for longer.  However, it was definitely enjoyable.  The graphics were very good, and it was great how they did it in black & white.  I recommend this flick for kids of all ages.
0385486804|4.0|The author is a real dope for even mentioning whether the poor, misguided young man had any homosexual encounter.  It had nothing to do with the story of how this young man lived or died.  That being said, I would recommend reading it if you are thinking about doing something &#34;fun&#34; like trying to see if you can outsmart mother nature.  Spoiler alert:  You can't.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I found the game a bit boring and the pinch in to zoom stinks.  Not going to purchase this one it was bland for my taste could be harder and more intriging
0061733199|5.0|Purchased this just for fun reading on the beach.  You can never have too much knowledge and if you are ever stranded in the middle of nowhere, the information in this book could save your life.  A variety of well-explained, useful tips, and easy to read.  Definitely written by an &#34;English&#34; (British) author.
B0053O89KG|4.0|So I love Castle, but at the start of the fourth season it seemed like it was losing it's charm. I felt like it was drifting into the realms of an angsty teen drama.<br />Mood swings, repeating themes, lame plot twists...<br />Sometimes the studio uses the same tricks too often (for example, the &#34;let's spice up the suspense by starting this episode from the ending then then flashing back to the start&#34;; I think this season had two of those episodes, which is two too many if you ask me). The bank job episode was another one that may have seemed good on paper, but the story's nothing new, and the characters are stretching their roles a bit beyond belief.<br />I think several episodes had HUGE potential, but fell just a bit short. The Blue Butterfly was a great episode. I absolutely LOVED it; but I don't think they quite nailed it. They were also onto something in the episode where Castle and Beckett were kidnapped, but I think it could have had a bit more of a Memento style suspense rather than remembering everything right away.<br />The &#34;Ghost Hunters&#34; episode was cool, and the zombie episode was PERFECT!!<br />In the end, they won me over. I enjoyed the season, but it didn't quite live up to former Castle glory.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed how the book was honesty & not overly edited & used real military language!  Reality with heart!<br /><br />MSgt Retired
B007DIQC90|5.0|Great album. I'm looking forward to what these guys can accomplish in the future. In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy what they have ready to enjoy right now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a great sequel to Temple Run..some great new additions to the game to make it make challenging.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|can't believe that is the best movie of the year.  All it did was tell the history which most Americans are too stupid to know or believe
B0012909NQ|1.0|The trio(no this is NOT THE BAND GENESIS BUT GENEFRAUD!!) used players that would be better in a jazz fusion or pop band, and there are missing Genesis members here to be considered a reunion. Steve Hackett, Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks, and last and least Phil Collins made up the real Genesis. Ripples sounds terrible since, Steve Hackett's guitar solo is missing in the song and they played it at such a slow tempo. Daryl is just a bad player for a so called; progressive rock band. Genesis live in Concert 1976 Trick of the Tail tour(featuring Steve Hackett and Bill Bruford) the 1973 Selling England By The Pound Oxford show tour(featuring Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel) and the 1977 Seconds Out video are far better choices than this waste. Many Genesis fans including myself are really getting sick of Phil Collins and his silly pop songs and antics. No Supper's Ready, no Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and not even the Genesis signature songs The Musical Box or The Knife. I respect Phil Collins as a professional percussionist and a back up singer, but not as a writter. Phil does a fantastic job drumming but lacks the visionary ideas(The ideas Peter Gabriel had) to put together TRUE Genesis masterpieces like [[ASIN:B001L63JC8 The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway]] The Musical Box,[[ASIN:B001KQEG62 Watcher Of The Skies [New Stereo Mix]]] [[ASIN:B001R6EIOA The Knife]] and Supper's Ready. These Genesis classics were written in a time when Phil Collins was drumming and not writing with the band. Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford use the \\"Genesis\\" name by basing the name on Phil's solo success, letting Phil write and bring in his hired hands on the live performances when Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks already had their own solo albums. Daryl Stuermer was never a perfect fit here, since he wrote absolutely nothing in this so called \\"progressive rock band\\" nor could even play in the style of progressive. Can't even play Watcher of the Skies! Most prog players use a Gibson LesPaul(everybody from David Gilmour, Steve Hackett, Robert Fripp, to Alex Lifeson)guitar for a cleaner sound as in [[ASIN:B00FWB6ZBA Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith]] and [[ASIN:B00L9JJTSU Genesis Revisited: Live at the Royal Albert Hall]] while Daryl uses a Steinberger meant for jazz fusion songs. It's a mystery as to why Daryl was even hired. Steve Hackett did more in 7 years for Genesis in writing and innovative guitar playing(including inventing a style of playing called tapping that Eddie Van Halen used in Van Halen also called the hammer-on) than Daryl Stuermer did in 15(the fake fans say 30 but 1978-1993 is not 30 years) being a non writing stage prop. Stuermer is not a member but an employee of Atlantic Records that was told to play with this band when they needed him. Daryl messes up most of what Steve had already written. There is a reason why Daryl Stuermer and Chester Thomson weren't standing next to Genesis when the band was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when Steve Hackett was. Daryl is also member of the jazz fusion band Jean-Luc-Ponty, a band that happened to be on the same record label as this one. Do you see Steve Hackett playing Ponty songs like [[ASIN:B000008C0Y Enigmatic Ocean]] and wrongfully taking credit for it? Chester Thompson did better work on Steve Hackett's [[ASIN:B000086EOE Genesis Revisited]] [[ASIN:B00005MM7F Steve Hackett - Tokyo Tapes (Live in Japan)]] [[ASIN:B000AM1TH6 Please Don't Touch]] as well as Tony Banks' [[ASIN:B002NV9AH8 Curious Feeling: 30th Anniversary Edition]] Progressive rock spawned on the hatred of overplayed pop, yet these guys go with what they were against after putting out 10 progressive rock albums with Steve Hackett and/or Peter Gabriel? If Tony Banks owns the \\"Genesis\\" name then what good is it if there are no real members to back it up? What good is a progressive rock band, if it bases itself off Phil Collins' solo pop act with non writing jazz fusion players? Should progressive rock bandslike Yes, and King Crimson base their music off Madonna and Micheal Jackson? Why accept change when change is bad? Phil needs to keep his writing in his own band, and in Genesis to stay behind the drum kit where he belongs. The Genesis phony fans need to really wake up here. No Steve Hackett, no Peter Gabriel, means no Genesis. Genesis is a progressive rock band, not a Motown based pop band! Genesis coverband \\"The Musical Box\\" is a far better choice and does a better job than this! Journalists, and TV show talk hosts still ask Steve Hackett, Peter Gabriel, and even Phil Collins \\"When is there going to be a Genesis reunion?\\" as if this waste of a tour never existed. PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: The people that vote this review as not helpful are the ones that were NEVER GENESIS FANS in the first place, ONLY FANS OF PHIL COLLINS since these phonies never supported Genesis Or Steve Hackett when Phil Collins quit in 1996 on Calling All Stations Live In Poland or  the release of Genesis Revisited however had no problem supporting Phil on his Dance Into the Light album released that same year, both Genesis and Steve Hackett both were forced to quit their US tours thanks to these fake fans. Genesis folded due to this abandonment and these fakes still call themselves Genesis fans?!  SO NEVER RELY ON THEIR VOTES AND NEVER BELIEVE THEIR BOGUS REVIEWS! I REPEAT THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED AS NOT HELPFUL ARE NOT GENESIS FANS!!! IF YOU FIND THIS REVIEW AS NOT HELPFUL THEN YOU'RE EITHER TOO STUPID TO KNOW WHAT HELP IS, OR TOO COWARDLY TO FACE THE TRUTH!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|love this game!!  its in the same family as mahjong, you have to match the matching cubes within the larger cube.  the 3-D and visual affects are great--game is definitely addicting.  highly recommend
B009439HEY|5.0|Here Genesis member Steve Hackett shows what Genesis was really about. Great master pieces like The Musical Box, Supper's Ready, and lost songs like Please Don't Touch. It is great to see Steve presenting Genesis as they really were. Not as a silly pop band that they turned into!
B000E41MRC|5.0|REVIEW FROM FILMPHREAK.TUMBLR.COM<br />It’s a peculiar feeling, to say the least, writing a positive review of a Nazi propaganda film. But there are a few things to consider before calling down judgement upon me for this. I’m certainly not espousing Nazism. And I’m not the only critic to hail this as a masterpiece of cinema. To truly be understood, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL, Leni Riefenstahl’s masterpiece of propaganda meets documentary, must be considered from multiple directions. The first analysis that will naturally spring to mind is assessment of what one is seeing in light of what one knows in hindsight about the Nazis and their atrocities. It’s ironic to view a film full of talk of socialism - a philosophy that by definition favors the people - and statements that the people run the state and not the other way around, while reeling from the juxtaposition of this positive good government talk against the deaths of millions of Jews. But one must also approach the film as though one knew nothing about such things; this allows analysis in a vacuum. As such, it’s a rousing bit of nationalism that feels remarkably similar in tone to the U.S. propaganda newsreels from back in the olden days. Except, of course, that TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is a far superior film to the bulk of those old rah-rah-ree flag wavers. And that leads us even deeper into vacuum analysis of the film. Simply as a work of cinema, the movie is nothing short of being a masterpiece. Riefenstahl’s eye is immaculate, delivering panorama after sweeping panorama and stirring visual compositions. The cinematography is one of the film’s best features. Given that it is the documenting - with appropriate propaganda editing techniques (hi, Michael Moore, and, no, I’m not a Republican) - of the huge 1934 Nazi Party Rally, filled with lots of speechifying and marching and presentations, etc., the movie is shockingly engaging. TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is a brilliant execution of both editing and cameraworkand arguably one of the finest films in cinematic history, atrocious philosophical underpinnings aside. Speaking of which, one won’t find one’s self inundated with anti-Semitism - though there is a bit about racial purity, generally speaking. Rather, one will be confronted with a vibrant display of nationalist documentarianism. I’m not a nationalist, but I know good cinema when I see it.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Got this for my grandkids to enjoy on my Kindle, but there were few instructions on how to navigate the 'game', plus it is the most difficult app to get out of once you are in it.

B007SGM084|1.0|This degrades women in more than one factor. Shocked it has made so much money and got so famous. I heard it was a good read. That is why I bought these books. I found them absolutely incredibly degrading, demoralizing and insulting. WOULD NOT recommend.

B00846F1YW|5.0|I have many types of hidden object games. This one is now one of my of favorites.  The story line is good. The hidden objects are not extremely hard. I have had to use the hint option a few times. Mysteryville 2 has added puzzles, which is a nice thing. This game also has the find the difference, which is very easy in my opinion.  Challenging hidden objects, easy find the differences, and the addition of the puzzles makes this a great game. Oh, the puzzles are not to hard, but do take some time to solve. I do recommend this game for all and definitely for hidden object junkies.<br />Hope you enjoy!  &#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632; :D
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I LOVE THE MATRIX AND I LOVE SPECIAL FEATURES. THIS COLLECTION HAS BOTH. WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO SAY?
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Ive tried and purchased many games such as this and this was one of the best...definitely best for the price! (Most like this are at least 2.99 so this is a great deal) Hours of game play..ran smoothly on my samsung galaxy 2 tab. I ended up skipping several of the mini games as they are tricky. Great hint feature, cute story line. I was not required to purchase more to continue to the end as other reviews stated. Happy with this purchase and<br />looking for more great aps like this for the price.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This is a marvelous film that certainly is in the top five of my all-time favorites. It has none of the big-hit qualities like war, violence, lust, corruption, money, power, fame, drugs... , but it has the enduring qualities of true love, fidelity, patience, faith, tradition, simplicity, joy, heartbreak, and beauty. Zhang Ziyi is luminous, the cinematography is gorgeous, the sets and costumes are meticulous, and the storyline is timeless.<br /><br />The only thing this movie needs is a full-blown Bluray release, with all the color fidelity and visual crispness restored. The DVD presentation looks weak, and the extras are next to worthless. A film of this level of accomplishment deserves a respectful and complete treatment. It's been far too long that this has not happened, and it's a loss for the movie-loving community that this gem is ignored by Sony Pictures Classics and left to languish in its current format.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I watched the other three first and then right before I was about to \\"rent\\" it through the site, I noticed what terrible reviews other people were giving. I almost did not bother when I read them-now I'm glad I rented it anyway. Are you people kidding me??<br />First of all, yes, it is FREAKING SCARY! No movies since \\"The Ring\\" have scared me like these, and the last installment is no different. Yes, there were a few 'in-jokes' etc., that the 4th movie could have gotten along without. Maybe. But I think our reaction to them, that of being slightly annoyed and rolling our eyes, is part of the whole experience.<br />Second of all, the reason these movies stay scary is because so much is totally unknown. We don't have a good handle on any \\"facts\\" in this story; not about the demon, not about the coven, not about the identities of each of the characters. In fact, all we get to go on is what the average person gets to go on from surveillance type video footage: just what is presented to the camera. And just because one person says something directly to the camera does not mean we should take it at face value. Obviously, there was a whole lot more to the story than Katie ever told us in the beginning of the first movie! We get just enough of the story to keep us coming back for more.<br />What I really want to see next is people fighting this thing, not just being victimized. Where is this demonologist mentioned in the first movie? Whatever happened to him?
B002RI9UBS|3.0|A good yarn... But not an award winning story in my opinion. And if anyone tries to \\"based on a true story\\" you...forget it. Pure fantasy...
B002C4YYEU|2.0|Mork was from a planet where people were born old and got younger as they aged. This tv series,starring Robin Williams, was basically the story line for this movie. It's sort of like watching a Burger King commercial and then rushing out to buy the lucious burger pictured on tv. The disappointment with both is palpable.
0374214913|2.0|While I typically enjoy classics and quality writing over pop fiction, I do enjoy literary mysteries that are somewhat whimsical from time to time and this book looked interesting to me.  It may well be, but I just cannot get past the 'I sit in a coffee shop in Seattle wearing a beanie and being busy on my Mac' vibe.  I think the helpful people who work at the Genius Bars in Apple stores may really enjoy this book.  I'm simply not ready for it, try as I may.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Sent fast! Excellant service! I recieved it before in was in stores and much cheaper too! Why go out to shop?
B00BHMF578|5.0|I hesitated to want to watch this because of the association of a certain comedy factor within the trailer that I found to be not to my liking. That said, the movie is pure gold. Great performances and plot.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have always seen Lincoln more or less as in the image from the Lincoln Memorial.  This introduced me to the flesh and blood man and I really did like him much more.  A fascinating read.  The only sad part is to discover how little things have changed in the way our congress works!  Except I have to think things are even worse now than they were in the 1860s!  Still, Lincoln was a genius and I'm so thankful we were lucky enough to have him as our President during the time he served.  I confess to a built-in prejudice toward Doris Kearns Goodwin --she's one of my favorite authors but she did a superb job in bringing our 16th President to life in the pages of this book.  Thank you Doris!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had never heard of the Silver Linings Playbook until I saw the movie winning awards on tv. Finding out about the book, I did a little research to see what all the fuss was about. This was an amazing book. I am so glad I found out about it.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|Great movie, great price! To me it is as good as or better than the best Disney movies. Admittedly, James Earl Jones is what made this movie better than others (I'm a Star Wars fan). It is a great family movie, date movie, feel good movie... it's just great :) Hope you get it and enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. It's soo much fun and very addictive. People of all ages will love it. It's honestly one of the best games I've ever played
B00002SSKI|5.0|Loved this movie since I was a kid! My boyfriend claims it's the girl version of &#34;Stand by Me&#34; or &#34;The Goonies.&#34; He says that he dislikes this movie but whenever I watch it (and that's a lot) he'll always say &#34;this is the best part&#34; and ends up watching the whole movie with me. I think this is a great movie for any age, but in particular younger girls. I saw it when I had just started middle school and I think that was a good time. I was too young to really like boys but old enough to like the movie. I am not a parent, so please do not take this as a recommendation for what age is appropriate to watch this. I think it's appropriate for any age because it is innocent and contains a lot of good lessons for kids. I felt, as a kid, I learned a lot about how relationships can be so different for each child growing up. Being young you assume everyone's family is mostly similar to what your family is or even what's on TV. I felt this showed a more realistic view inside families houses that included parents that were getting divorced, a widowed father, and overprotective parents. It reveals not only what happens within these families but also how the kids cope with their home life and the realization that not all families are perfect, including their own. All in all it is a great movie with a mystery, boys, a birth, and the best part is the powerful relationships between the four main female characters. There are even several 'girl power' moments that will make you smile big :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|GOOD JOB, you really needed a game to get yourself back on top because the makers of Subway surfers were doing very good.
B0053O89XI|5.0|I really love this series and every time I watch an episode, I find something new to laugh at.<br /><br />The blu-rays look very good and the sound is excellent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have many words for ya fantastic awesome of awesomeness love it i like the first one better though but i love it
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Escape from Camp 14 is a well-written account of life in the North Korean gulag camps, where thousands still languish today. The story is gritty and honest and moving.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love subway surfers it is the best game ever and u update it every mouth and u get to explore new citys towns and states
B006N57PXG|5.0|I like the magical set up of this universe coupled with modern technology...it felt like a good fit and it was very believable. Bartimaeus was devious the way you like and Nathaniel was not so much the typical wide eyed youth.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best out if all the temple runs! I could play this forever!!! It more fun and it's easier to get a higher score than on the first temple run.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I'm quite happy with this cover for my Kindle fire. A great price for a lightweight, attractive protective cover. Outstanding!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game so fun it the is cool because you want run fast so you don't get cot by the cop and his dog.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm a huge fan of hidden object games and this one is right up my alley. It's great that it's never ending. I don't like the in game buying feature.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! If you don't buy it you suck!:)Come on you know yo want to buy it so, buy it!!
B004QX07G4|4.0|Goes all over the place, but definitely laughed out loud a couple times.<br />Good read.<br />I would definitely recommend it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The storyline is top notch! The characters and their background progression is awesome! I love this show and will never stop watching!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Her writing is so descriptive that you can envision yourself in katniss's place and live like Katniss. Over all this book was just phenomenal
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This review is not going to be useful. I just want the author to know that I admire his imagination. It was a page turner for me. Only, I would not subscribe to the 'empowerment,' in the end. :) This could evolve to another Asimov's Foundation if you expand the silo universe. Please do, for the reader's sake. Take care.
B008CFN95I|5.0|I really enjoyed this book which brought many smiles to my face in the reading.  It's very inventive, the characters are interesting, and it's well written.  It's intended as a light read, which it is, but that doesn't diminish the pleasure it gives. I've recommended it to three other people, all of whom enjoyed it enormously.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this memory puzzle.  I play it every day and keep trying to beat my best score.  It's great for memory strenthening and eye/hand coordination.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This version works well and looks good on the kindle fire hd. It allows you to finish even when the block configuration wouldn't normally permit completing the game.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book! Very exciting, suspenseful, and kept me on the end of my seat. Can't wait to read more from this new author.<br /><br />Cissysk@gmail.com
B00BHMF578|4.0|A good, moving movie but not worth an Oscar. I was disappointed... Thought it would be much better. I still recommend the movie.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I snatched up this album when it was on sale for 1.99, and I feel like I've won the lottery...it really is the best album I've ever owned, as I've never thoroughly enjoyed every single track on an album before.  For that, I'd gladly pay full price and more!  All the other raters have already explained why it's so wonderful, so I'll just say that for me, the satisfaction I get from listening to this is a lot like the enjoyment I get from eating a perfect meal, watching a favorite movie, discovering a beautiful painting, witnessing a beautiful sunrise, or playing an awesome video game - all rolled into one.  That's art.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game. the best bit about it is that you can update to different themes all the time .you can get the game on all different types of phones and tablets.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Pun totally intended. Hehe.<br /><br />No holiday season is complete without watching It's a Wonderful Life at least once. Jimmy Stewart is at his loveable best in this movie. It is a classic tale of love, family, and doing the honorable thing, even if it's difficult. So many life lessons can be learned from this gem of a movie!<br /><br />This two-disc collector's set edition is nice to have, because sometimes I enjoy the Technicolor version but others, the original black and white is preferred. The documentary about the making of the film is also enjoyable.<br /><br />Everyone should own this movie!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I love it! I have a compromise.Why not try&quot;angry birds renovation realities&quot;?<br />I love the show,I love the game! You are the best!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love when I find a book, movie, mini-series that drags me in, gets me involved, mentally and emotionally. This show has captured me!! There are characters I love and even more, those I love to hate!! I have been sucked in. This show is my new addiction!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game!!!! Very helpful and fun and gives you a chance to take care of a &quot;real&quot; horse!!! Very very calming!!
B007PWXQWA|4.0|It's a good Cd. But not edgy at all, or played dangerous. Everything is played safe, and that is why I give it only 4 stars.<br />Maybe too safe. No wow moments!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I'd recommend it to anyone who likes books on rock n roll and drug history also is non fiction. I loved it I'd give it a 5 star rating!
B008645YEE|3.0|The sonics on a high end system are okay, at best. You skip through a lot, in order to find a couple of favorite tracks. If you are not a huge Batman fan skip this CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it because it is like a maze and it is fun I love mazes it was a challenge for me for my first time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really addictive game and i would encourage anyone to buy it a 5 Star all the way overall mint game.
B00005YW4H|5.0|brand new, hard to find, will be back. Telling everyone, was able to listen to song online before purchase,great experance.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I use to love this game bc I didn't have WiFi...recently they changed it and I would like it to go back to the way it was..thanks..other than that I love this game slot..thanks
6305531412|5.0|I do not regret the purchase, even though it was used, it was as if I had just opened it
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time!  Keeps you on your toes.  Interesting story line and great writing. I would recommend it to everyone, especially circus and magic lovers.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I really love this pen! I am a huge Doctor Who fan (and David Tennant rocks with this version of the screwdriver). I enjoy showing my fellow Whovians this, and confussing everyone else! The only thing that annoys me is that when I push the square up/down to extend/de-extend the screwdriver the sound and light goes off. Does anybody else have this problem? I don't touch the button it just always does it when I extend/de-extend the sonic. I really don't care that much, it's only a little and quick action that ruins the effect for me. But yeah...I love it! I just finished A God Complex on Netflix, and The Girl Who Waited is so sad....it's worse to watch than a Weeping Angel episode or Waters of Mars (and I didn't watch Waters of Mars it's so scary)!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Fanstastic and addictive  books beside Lord of the rings  ,Very good and compact of 5 books in one .Easy to read on the ipad .
0470449748|4.0|WARNING: 13th edition is out as of today 3/2/13. WARNING no integrated reasoning in this guide.<br /><br />This book is good for getting the practice you need. Definitely recommend as a guide with the 4th edition of Manhattan GMAT.<br /><br />Do the problems then go into manhattan to learn the things you forgot.<br /><br />This book is separated into sections not full length exams. Like 100-200 Quantitative multiple choice, Data sufficiency, critical reading, sentence correction problems.<br /><br />Got a 700. Nice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. the new update is a nice touch also.Give it a try.I can't put this one down.
0316212377|3.0|Dear Iain,<br /><br />I am your biggest fan. Visitors’ eyes in my living room fall directly on the strategically positioned 10 Culture novels when they look at my book case. They sit right in the center, Penguin novels or whatever else is considered high brow exiled from the sacred spot of the book case which tells your visitors who you are through your books collection.<br /><br />So, after this disclaimer, you might have guessed what follows: a big disappointment. Don’t get me wrong, nothing is really wrong with the Hydrogen Sonata. But nothing is really right with it either.<br /><br />The Hydrogen Sonata looks like teething problems on a ninety year old. How on earth did you manage to take such as grand issue as the Subliming and bring it down to a crazy galactic Bill Kilgore type “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”?<br /><br />Everything in the novel feels recycled. Granted, Iain Banks’ recycled material is other writers’ magnum opus, but we are not talking other writers here. Ships sound tired. Subliming falls flat. Culture even loses a ship to an inferior civilization.<br /><br />Dear Iain,<br /><br />to my horror, the horror, I suspect that you are by now obliged by contract to write a new Culture novel every 2 years. If this is the case, please take a note with us, center self book case fans, about what we would like to see.<br /><br />Perhaps we would like to see the End of Culture. And the Rebirth of it. Perhaps we would like to see Culture in Andromeda or the Clouds and what it finds there. Perhaps we would like to see Culture meet Tau Zero’s starship Leonora Christine. But we certainly would not like to see Culture become the Young and the Restless of the Galaxy, even though we would faithfully follow you through all 10.000 episodes.<br /><br />Dear Iain, please thrill us with the next Culture novel, even killing Culture if you have to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! It has challenged that makes me want to come back everyday and play! I love this game, but be careful, it's addicting
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is a good book but not really my cup of tea. I would refer it to others, and will finish the series.
B000001H00|5.0|We're collecting some &#34;essential&#34; violin recordings since a family member is taking up the instrument. This meets all expectations and is a delightful listen.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|haven't finished it yet ,but plan on it soon,the story line isn't my pick but wanted to finish the series.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Insightful and riviting.  Sad story of abuse and fear a young girl endures at the hands of her kidnappers.  I couldn't put it down.
630516603X|5.0|More of M. Flatley....very talented young man and totally entertaining.  I do miss his troupe that danced with him in the Riverdance video.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I love watching flicks that are terrible, just for the mere fact that some memorable lines emerge. This is a terrible flick without a single redeeming quality.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app I've found. I set it on to read at night and I fall asleep to the Gospel!
B001XUIBNO|5.0|Now you know. Chinatown is a most see for anyone who enjoys cinema. The characters and story are so rich that you might get a toothache from watching.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Recommended to us by our son, my wife and I both loved the season.  I thought the first episode, maybe into the second started a bit slowly, but wow...after that...each episode delivered the drama and surprises that have led to its multiple awards and praise.
B0091WAWTM|4.0|Do you need much more to watch this pretty entertaining flick? The build up is much better than the reward at the end but still satisfying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A little friend of mine got me into this game and now I can't stop playing it. It's challenging and it changes just enough that I don't get bored.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. At first I got it for my daughter but now we are all playing with the horse. Very realistic and really cute
B001IFZL50|5.0|This is a great show with amazing dialog following the first 30 day for the Iraq War. This is not a documentary but based on one following the First Recon Battalion. This includes lots of extra and its HD cut looks great. Once I started watching it I couldn't stop till I finished them all.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The story itself is excellent, but the book drags a lot in the middle. You can kind of see where it's going in places long before it gets there.
B007SGM084|5.0|I've read this three time and will read again.  Some in fact a good many things in this book are normal in a fulfilling sexual relationship.  It is a free at how-to book for both men and women.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel was a page turner start-to-finish but was disappointed in the lack of ending.  Great characters & story line
1451662432|5.0|“Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story,” the autobiography of Arnold Schwarzenegger, written with Peter Petre is indeed an engaging and fascinating look at the life story of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Denying all odds, Schwarzenegger went from being born in a small Austrian town to becoming one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, one of the highest paid action film stars of all time, a member of the Kennedy family, even though a Republican, and then the Governor of the state of California, a state that if alone would be included among the word's twenty major economies.  And now, in his 60s, he's not slowing down.  He's back making action movies and championing for various causes.<br /><br />The book is over 600 pages long and contains many photographs, and not for a minute of reading did I wish it was shorter.  I've been a fan of Schwarzenegger since the 70s with the bodybuilding scene, and have enjoyed all of his movies.  So I also enjoyed reading about his incredible journey.  Of course I knew some of it, because I've read the other biographies and numerous articles over the years.  However, I enjoyed Schwarzenegger's take on his own life, especially the parts where he writes about his drive and determination.  The “nothing can stop me and I will succeed at all costs” attitude that drove him to the pinnacles of the fields he chose to enter is motivating.  I enjoyed reading about his work ethic and how he would use every hour of each twenty-four hour day to achieve his goals.<br /><br />Some people might not like that he doesn't spend much time on the “dirt.”  Naturally, because it was major news, he addresses the son he had with his housekeeper that led to the separation with his wife, Maria Shriver.  Like Arnold has always done with negative things, he addresses it and moves on.  He's never been one to dwell on the negative, and he doesn't with this issue either.  He takes responsibility, apologizes for the pain it caused everyone involved, and moves on.  He still hopes that he and Maria will be back together again in the future.  Obviously, it is Arnold's autobiography and he's going to share what he wants to share and do it his way.  Who wouldn't?  I personally liked what he shared, and how he did it.  As I said, I found the book engaging, fascinating, and very motivating.<br /><br />If you want to know more about Arnold Schwarzenegger and are up for a motivating read on his incredible life, a true American success story, read “Total Recall.”<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the &#34;Tough Guy Wisdom&#34; series and others.and moves on.

1400052173|5.0|This book is an exceptional and personal journey through controversial issues in technology and bioethics. The writing style is easy to understand, would recommend it for students as young as high school aged. I'm a college student, and it's something of a seminal text for many of my classes on Public Health. Great book.
0893860468|5.0|This book is amazing. I carry it around with me like a bible. It has been so enlightening to me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another great season!  Cannot wait for Season 4. Will really miss one of my favorite characters.  Who will replace him/her?
B009VMN3RA|3.0|The book is interesting, but I'm not sure how truthful the facts are. The book is too one sided, and many questions there are not answered, and some stories that don't really make sense. If Ms. Parker has problems with her mom, writing a book is not the solution.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Emma. Austen's mystery novel with no mystery. I enjoyed Emma as Austen discusses the dangers of tampering with other people's lives, the characteristics a perfect gentleman should have, and what ignorance a spoiled class snob with managerial power could have.<br /><br />Emma is really a little different than Austen's other works. It doesn't have as much impact in story or romance. The story is going to feel dry to many people. It's a mystery novel with no mystery. But it's a good read for Austen fans and a great novel with many aspects to discuss.

Is this a common problem?<br />I'm very frustrated, as i really like this film when it works, but can't afford to use it if this keeps happening.

B001ANYDAO|1.0|This was the biggest waste of my money..  It is full on negative thoughts, and has an attitude if you weren't born right then you will not amount to anything.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author hit the nail on the head as far as the emotions go. I felt the sexual tension with each page.  Gray 's  torment  was so painful. I. Loved this book .Am ordering the next book<br /><br />,<br />''
1616550414|5.0|It's been a few weeks since the book arrived and when it did, a few weeks before schedule, it caught me completely off-guard. A pleasant surprise I might add. The book was a lot bigger than I had imagined, not to mention the amount of content in the book was astonishing. Finding any cons about the book is much more demanding task. I loved every page of it, even the manga in the back.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to purchase from Amazon again some time in the future. The shipping was fast, cheap and the product arrived in mint condition. Definitely worth the five stars.
0553801473|5.0|Book 5 continues the twists & turns & surprises of this series--keeping me enthralled & looking forward to the next (final?) one!
0345803507|5.0|I have not started reading the third book but hope it continues to read as well as the first two. Are there more in the series?
B000NU2CY4|5.0|The sapphire version is definitely the nicely remastered version. Movie was breath taking. Don't buy the old version, you won't get the same definition.
0345803493|5.0|I have not finished the book but I already know I love it! Can't wait to finish and start the third one.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|I thought this movie was done very well,  excellent acting by James Spader.<br /> It was very well written excellent storyline. it's a little racy for the younger crowd but a very very good movie.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|There are days when escaping earth to spend a few days in the stars is more than a pleasant diversion.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|About five minutes into this, my wife and I realized this was a musical. We sat there in shock looking at each other like &#34;Is this really happening? Is this a musical?&#34; We hate musicals. We made it through about ten minutes of it before we said no way, we can't watch this. Kinda disappointing, as we heard such great things about it.
B0078XFYDA|1.0|Forcing his atheistic views using simple science as justification. Kind of needlessly  gives science a bad name. If you have a scientific mind, you probably are already familiar with the simple concepts presented. If you don't  you don't want to read it anyway. If you do but lived in a cave all your life you might like it as sort of a catch up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Did not expect this book to be so deep!  Loved it all the way through!!  I have already recommended it to all my friends!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I waited a long time for this series on DVD.  Love it.  It's a shame that this series was cancelled.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Not much to say here.  The DVD arrived in one piece and is flawless.  I'm a &#34;Firefly&#34; fan and love it.
B0060MYM7O|2.0|I had such high hopes for this edition - given the lush, visual goodness of the First Season on Blu-ray.  This Season and the Blu-rays are indeed beautiful to behold.  However, my review is mainly about the technical side of things.  Buyer beware about pre-ordering the first edition on the production line.  Although I am only on the 5th episode ... I am encountering glitches, freezes and skips in EVERY episode.  Produced with the highest standards ...?!?!  Sadly - not my copy.  Hopefully, this isn't happening to to many other customers - it's a terrible shame to ruin such an incredible show.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this series and Yeah They got picked up for another season. Yeah! I have every season and hope the show goes on as long as it can. Love it
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|Works like a charm. I even dropped it out of a 3rd story window and it still works. I recommend buying it, not dropping it out of a window though.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This movie was great for kids and added a lot of &#34;adult&#34; humor also. Even my husband who is not a fan of the cartoon movies was laughing thru it right along side the kids. Will consider this one of the best movies of this year.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Saw other reviews talking about issues with missing codes or disks that wouldn't play, but wanted the set and at 30 bucks its a steal. Unfortunately, I got hit with the &#34;packaging issue&#34; just like a lot of other folks...<br /><br />The Blu-Ray's were fine and all of them played perfectly; the digital code was also included so no problem there. The DVD set was the issue as both disks were marked up and disk one had several deep scratches. The display box that the disks sit in has damage as well. The corners were all nicked up and had paper peeling away from the cardboard around the edges.<br /><br />Amazon's packaging was perfect as usual, so it must be a factory issue considering the DVD's were sealed and scratched inside the shrink wrap. This is actually the 2nd HBO set I've bought that's had damage to the display box and inner cardboard, but the first with disk issues.<br /><br />4-stars because the show is great, and it's not Amazon's fault... I am surprised so many people had various issues with the set though.
0307878937|4.0|Liked learning the 'meaning' of flowers... but don't believe the info  is used so much with those who send flowers these days.<br />Great audio book for those commuting.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This is the best new band I have seen come on the scene in a great many years. Every song is great on here and I could listen to this album many times in a row without tiring of it.
1616550414|5.0|This book was dirt cheap for what it is. It's really cool and has tons of artwork and history from all of the Zelda games to date. I paid $20 for this, and it was well worth it.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Every song is awesome, I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys the sound of good music. It sounds a little like a kick back to the Mamas and Papas, which is awesome.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I honestly don't like it. ONLY because for a few weeks I could do it without wi fi but now I just. Use YouTube because it I is less glinchy
B007M45PMU|5.0|They have a really awesome sound that is a little like folk mixed with rock and bluegrass. Seriously love this band.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is great for texting, but only if the recipient has KIK. Its probably the worlds fastest messenger. I would definately reccomend this to a friend.
B000000XBC|3.0|Good CCR but many unknown tracks.  Good stuff but many unknown tracks is all.  If you just like their style you will enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever!It works great on the kindle.  I play it all the time especialyRome subway surfers
B0031QVW2U|5.0|Everything was exactly as expected and described.  A definitely must add to the Sunbounce Sniper Strap.  Keeps the strap in place perfectly.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have a Kinect for Xbox 360 and I saw this and got it. I played it a few times. I think it's better on the Kinect just because you can move around and there's a shadow on the screen that looks like you. I still think it's awesome on the kindle fire, but personally I think it's cooler on Kinect. On the kindle you get more blades, but no shadow. I still highly recommend it though.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Best show on HBO in my opinion. If you haven't read or watched the frist season it is a must, you won't regret it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a fantastic show! Not only does it have zombies, which I love, but the story of the characters and the choices they are faced with keeps me watching.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am so addicted to this app. I run and run and run trying to get more coins so I can upgrade all my abilities. Download this, you won't regret it!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I really enjoyed the creative screenplay and staging of this classic story.  However, I found the acting to be uneven.  I though Jude Law did an excellent job as Karenin, although I am not usually a fan of his work.  The actors who played Stiva and Levin were equally good.  The other main actors, however, did an uneven job.  The creativity of the movie, however, kept me interested throughout.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose to read this because the movie just came out and I won't go to the movies.  I was amazed at the feelings this book brought out in me.  Everyone should take a moment and fall in love with Alex!
B005LAIHPY|2.0|The subject matter & plot seemed to me to be very un-plausable. Kinda silly & will likely give the dvd to someone who might appreciate the science fiction genre.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Where the hell is Flipboard?  I clicked &#34;buy with one click&#34; and it says go to apps store to download. Anyhow it says i have it and to go to my apps library and find it there. It is &#34;not&#34; on my damn Kindle! LIARS.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Saw this in a production in London, England.  For some reason the story became very emotional for me & happy to have this rendition of the musical.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The sexual  side between the two young characters early in the story of this book, was far too dominant, thought it was unnecessary . Took too long to get readers interest . However. I persevered and ended up quite enjoying the book
1582701709|2.0|Get to the point already! I started reading it and thought I need to write a book called &#34;The Secret to the Road Less Travelled meets at the Four Agreements to Eat, Pray, Love.&#34;
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I always wait for a new book from Patricia Cornwell where the main characters are Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy and Benton. I think I have read all of her books where Scarpetta is the main character. I liked The Bone Bed and think it was better than for example The Scarpetta factor.
0486290492|5.0|I absolutely love this book. My 3rd favorite Austen I like to keep paperback copies to give as gifts. I love the subtleties and innuendo,
B0000062Y2|5.0|First..there are more than one CD in this soundtrack.<br />Secondly, there are more than one rendition of songs from the movie.<br /><br />I loved playing and singing to this on a cross-country trip last fall. I agree with the reviewers, that this should have been digitally remastered, taking out all the background noise. However, I still love it. There were a couple of pieces that the tempo seemed to fast...the the vocalists were trying to keep up with the band...and that was a problem with the stage version I saw.<br /><br />But...I still love it. Jesus Christ Superstar is my favorite musical of all time.
1616550414|5.0|Yes Yes Yes!  Anyone who is a fan of Zelda, you must had this to your collection.  Shigeru Miyamoto finally chimes in on the Zelda timeline theories, finally laying to rest years of speculation.  Its cool to see preliminary sketches of characters to their final renditions.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app is very easy to use and effective. I don't even use my traditional alarm clock and solely use this one instead.
B004SRNH10|3.0|works like its supposed too. nothing really outstanding about it but it serves its purpose. I like that it was free
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Totally entertaining!!!! These guys are amazing. Self effacing and funny, but they play like no other band out there. You will be glad you watched this doc even if you are not a fan of Rush.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an awesome game. I have a lot of fun playing it. Woohoo.<br /><br />I hope everyone has a great time playing ice age village.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Best season of all. Hannah is so much more interesting as a girlfriend to Dexter than Rita was.Series has developed well!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The Kindle Folio Case is exactly as described. It seems to be well made, and really protects my Kindle Fire well. It's easy to use and I have had NO trouble getting it to stand up. I sometimes use it on my kitchen counter while I busy there. Works well!! I love it!
B003L77G6K|5.0|Being a late comer to the show, I've watched all 4 season beginning to end.  The addition of more female characters (wonderfully cast) has been a great addition to the show.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The display is much easier to see than the little green or white line that comes with my Original Kindle Fire. More information is given so, I know how to conserve the battery life when I am away from power. Great free app.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I had 5 of the first 8 on DVD, missing one in the middle so I upgraded to this.  I got it for $49 dollars, all 8 movies, on blu ray.  No fancy collectors edition but you get all 8 for a great price...on blu ray.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|As i Said You should read this book, it has a lot a good (eye open) information that will help you achieve the result that you want, I've been reading a lot of books and this one is the best.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|Every season gets better and the blu ray version is great.  Love the behind the scenes commentary as well as the gag reels.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Would not suggest this book to read and yes it is a fast read, but unrealistic in real life. Could have been better written.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  Fell in love with season one and season two did not dissapoint.  Sheldon is the bomb.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Enjoyable movie and learned and bought back memories about baseball and how it was so enjoyed years back.  Hoping the movie sparks a love for baseball again.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an addicting, fun and cool. You really will not regret downloading such an awesome game. You will enjoy.
B005X7HAAS|4.0|Another great addition to my Asian Movie Collection.  This flick was great in all aspects.  A must buy for Avid Collectors.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|A book every one must read.  It offers the best understanding from an evolutionary perspective why we have allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, autism, etc.  It not only explains but also points out that by returning to our evolutionary diet and even lifestyle we can offer return to health.  Every person who is planning to become pregnant needs to read this to reduce the chance that their child will suffer from illnesses induced by not respecting our microbiota that inhabit our gut.<br /> E.P
B005WUHAX8|5.0|My LifeProof case is wonderful!  It is very durable and protects my IPhone in a sleek and easy to hold case.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 20, working in a video store. I loved it then, and I love it now. I remembered this and finally bought it. It was everything I remembered.
B0044ZQ8QC|5.0|I really love Corelli's music. It is very elegant and lovely and these discs hold great performances of it. I'm not especially knowledgeable about music, but I would say that Corelli strikes me as a very solid composer and his music is extremely beautiful to me, though I wouldn't call it groundbreaking composition. I found it very easy to listen to several hours of these Corelli discs without feeling at all worn out by it, as say Beethoven might do. I realize those are different time periods and styles, but that is one of the things I love about Corelli's baroque style. Anyway, I got 10 discs of excellent baroque music for around $30. A fantastic deal!
1592407889|5.0|I was so engrossed in it right from the start. I'm not sure what all the fuss about Shirley MacLaine's parenting is about - her daughter's love for her shines through in every story. Maybe those who only read \\"excerpts\\" should not be the most relied upon reviewers...? I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of Sachi Parker in this well written touching account of her life. In spite of all the \\"celebrity\\", I think many readers will identify with the emotions of this mother-daughter relationship.<br /><br />Each stage of her life was captured and perfectly rendered to bring the emotional level of the reader right to that point in their own life. I could feel the shy six year old inside of me wanting my parents' approval; and the teenager that wanted so badly to fit in but not to disappoint to her parents. And now - the mother - I won't go on for fear of spoiling the story for others.<br /><br />A great read that I recommend to all!
031618201X|3.0|Cail Garringer is known in steampunk fiction for her Parasol Protectorate series. The first volume of which has been adapted into a manga-styled graphic novel from Seven Seas.<br /><br />This gothic fantasy is set in alternate Victorian London where creatures like werewolves and vampires are commonplace. The main character is Alexia who is a \\"soulless\\" woman in search of her missing husband. Alexia is a medium between our world and the supernatural. She attracts the affections of a werewolf lord after she accidently kills a vampire with her parasol, and because of it becomes the main suspect of a series of vampire murders.<br /><br />While this might sound like a cheap grab at the Twilight crowd, it actually is a deep story with some witty and surprising turns to it. This was handled pretty well for an American manga, with art by artist Rem who also worked on the Vampire Kisses manga adaptation. Keep in mind though that its meant for mature readers due to some of the sexual content.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like playing this! The only suggestion I can think of is maybe a search bar so that I can easily find my friends' villages. But this is truly a wonderful game, and I totally recommend it!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|One of the most important aspects of a movie, or a book for that matter, is 'replay' value. Can you watch a movie more than once and still get something out of it? Can you read a book more than once and get something from it?<br /><br />\\"Contact\\", the movie, seems to meet the criteria for replay value, at least for me. I have seen it possibly a dozen times, and I have enjoyed it every time.<br /><br />There are criticisms that it isn't like the book by Carl Sagan. The same can be said of many movies. I haven't read the book yet, so I cannot address this.<br /><br />What I can address is why I find this movie consistently entertaining and would recommend it.<br /><br />Acting:<br /><br />The actors are all pretty convincing and do a memorable job.<br /><br />Jodi Foster carries the film as Ellie Arroway with believability and a great humanity. In the scene where she is about to launch in the \\"machine\\", she shows a considerable amount of nervousness and even fear. Given the character's situation, I'd say, YES! I'd be scared out of my mind! It wouldn't stop me, but I'd still be scared. She also shows vulnerability as her character gets tossed over by political rivals, especially the Tom Skerritt character.<br /><br />Tom Skerritt delivers a fine performance as the smarmy intellectual uber scientist David Drumlin who seems to have made it is personal quest to defeat Jodi Foster's character at every turn. He is so unlikeable, just short of being a villain.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey plays Palmer Joss with excellent patience and sensitivity. His sexual interest in Arroway is obvious from the start, and when she basically abandons him early in the film, he doesn't really hold it against her. It does come as a surprise when during the selection hearings for who is to go visit the aliens, he sidewinds her. Fortunately, the script is sympathetic enough to have him explain his real motivations were selfish, he wants her to stay around as his love interest, even though she is often not there for him.<br /><br />John Hurt as S.R. Hadden is a delight. He's confident and a real \\"angel\\" in the financial sense. He supports Ellie brilliantly throughout the film, and he has a cynicism that is fun to watch.<br /><br />The other actors ( and there are many!) are also very good and deliver fine and believable performances.<br /><br />The film is worth a look just for their acting craft.<br /><br />Another plus in the movie is the musical score by Alan Silvestri. He really knows how to make the most of the simplest melodies, and his score is understated, gentle and just wonderful to hear.<br /><br />Finally, the sets and graphics are very good to excellent. The design of the 'machine' is suitably pseudo scientific and looks serious enough, and the outer space scenes are top notch. In this movie, getting there really is half the fun!<br /><br />For all these reasons, the film is very entertaining.<br /><br />Now, as to the \\"message\\".<br /><br />Yes, the movie does try to pit science against religion, or vice versa. It's an argument that is getting so old it is almost cliche. No one seems to ever try the middle of the road where the two can work together, religion reveals mystery, science attempts to explain mystery.<br /><br />And it is because of the all black/white polarization that some of the plot and dialog miss the boat for me.<br /><br />I like the line where Palmer asks Ellie, \\"Did you love your father, prove it.\\" It is a valid argument because love is something that pure scientific inquiry cannot yet prove or measure or replicate. It is a mystery. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.<br /><br />There is a point in the film where during the selection process, they ask Ellie if she believes in God. Of course, she has to hem and haw and finally say she cannot prove God. So, of course, she is disqualified because \\"95% of the population of the Earth do believe in God\\".<br /><br />If the film wasn't trying to make such an antagonistic argumentbetween science and religion, it could have had Ellie respond in the most logical way. She could have responded: \\"I personally do not because I cannot find proof to my satisfaction. However, as a representative of the people of Earth, I would tell the aliens that 95% of humanity does believe in a God. And as a scientist, I would ask them, what they believe.\\" The script doesn't allow this common sense response, and it was a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The faith vs. evidence argument is played out again after Ellie has returned from her journey and cannot prove that she has been anywhere. The film only leaves us with a question about 18 hours of static on the video recording device. However, what happened to the science here?<br /><br />If it seems like Ellie didn't go anywhere, and the 'machine' is still working just fine, why not send her or someone else on another trip? In other words, do what scientists are supposed to do, replicate the experiment. How they missed this is beyond me. It seemed so obvious!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />In spite of the muddy message of the movie, it is very well produced, well acted, has great sets and shows considerable restraint for a scifi movie. It is not an 'action thriller', it is thought provoking. It has great music and is an overall enjoyable experience. The 'message' and philosophical arguments are a bit too one dimensional to really hold weight, and the use of common sense would have made it a better script, but it wouldn't have the political and emotional tug that they got out of it. Still, its a movie I can watch over and over and still enjoy.<br /><br />That to me, is the sign of a truly good film.between science and religion, it could have had Ellie respond in the most logical way.

B009NUPMH4|5.0|if you are a fan of Laura Pausini this is icing on the cake, the songs have a feel only accomplished by by being in front of a live audience, this singer keeps polishing her voice and her style, there are many jazz accents and ad lib melodics added to her less rigid recordings, the video brings it home, best enjoyed while in a long car ride, or as i did invite some Pausini fans, have a cook out and instead of watching a basketball game or football game watch this, i felt for a moment what it is like for italians to love live events and value much more the live performance than the electronic version of it, enjoy Laura a clean cut romantic rock and pop star with definite latin hips and great rhythm.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Truthfully, I'm not a big Nicholas Sparks fan.  His stories are so SAD!  However, the movie trailers looked like this story would be good.  I'm so glad I read it.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.  The characters come to life, and his descriptions allow you to feel like you are there.  It's as simple as that.  Not many books surprise me, but something in this certainly did!  When you read it, you'll know exactly what I mean.  Now I want to see the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of books need to be added to every high school reading list. The stories move along quickly and hold your attention throughout. There are some minor improbabilities, but they really don’t detract from the storyline. I am working on the shift series now and would recommend those too, to understand how this all came about.
0375842209|4.0|Death, who is both coolly matter-of-fact about the misery the characters will endure and irrefutably changed by the souls he must collect from the world, narrates The Book Thief. And there are many souls to gather, for The Book Thief is a story of Germany during World War II.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger is nine years old at the beginning of The Book Thief and just beginning to learn the power of words. Death \\"spoils\\" many of the events in the book at the beginning of each chapter, sprinkling bits and pieces about the story like breadcrumbs the reader collects and follows throughout the story to digest the entirety of the heartbreak Liesel will encounter as the war progresses.<br /><br />Death, for all its resigned posturing, is a delicate narrator. Markus Zasak's language brought me to tears several times during my reading. I was left with my heart in my hands at the end of The Book Thief, sickened by the horrors humanity can inflict upon itself but also in awe of the powerful kindness found in the hearts of others.
0815411839|5.0|If you are looking for a book to learn out Miss Monroe, this book is fantastic. It goes in depth about psychological problems and gives many facts not known by many. Loved this book!!
0307341550|4.0|From the first page of Sharp Objects I was drawn into the head of Camille Preaker, the desperately flawed main character. Beautiful from the neck up, Camille has damaged the rest of her body in a roadmap of memories and words and flashes of her past that unfolds throughout the story.<br /><br />Flynn's storytelling is powerful, and her perspective struck a tone with me that made me feel as though the violence in Sharp isn't exploitative.  You'll put down the book thinking about how our society processes violence, contemplating hormones in food, questioning the roles of genetics and the environment, and wondering how mean girls have so much power.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Just didn't hold my intrest like I would hae liked. I guess I just was expecting too much after reading other readers comments
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Our daughter purchased this and she loves it.  She says it is well worth the money!  She would buy it again.
B004CURZFC|5.0|I enjoyed every moment of this movie.  It is a family movie as well as a movie for adults.  It was adventurous.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I loved shopaholic. I liked this book. This is a good book to read on a sunny day at the beach.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but was a little slow to start, but once it got going I just wanted to read and see what happens. Looking forward to seeing the movie now :) love Nicholas sparks and his love stories he tells.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|You immediately and sincerely feel the pain the heroine is living with, and you know it's not her fault that she suffers so, and you find yourself rooting for her to fight her inner demons and come out the amazing loving person you know she is capable of. My favorite part of any story are the characters I can instantly connect with and this author does that spectacularly. Besides that, I thoroughly enjoyed the language of flowers, never having really considered the meanings of flowers but now I find myself quite intrigued by them. Wonderful read.
1400069289|5.0|This book grabs one's attention, and holds it like a crab on a chicken leg in a Louisiana salt bay. It takes one into situations of real people, and after telling their story, then slides one thru complex experiments to prove and demonstrate the point, with clever diagrams straight out of comics, or one of the endless internet explanatory books, and provokes a searchlight thru all ones experiences, and that of present, and former spouses and friends. I'm just now entering the corporate habits section, but I can't imagine a finer \\"self-help\\" book, with its elegant simplicity of explanation, and if this read doesn't double my productivity and utility and understanding of friends and family in the next little while, I'll be sorely disappointed.

B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game but it is not that great. Please improve it more. I like the graphics on the game but there should more that you can do when it is free.
1451695195|5.0|I bought his book because I too remember the void he speaks about. Only my experience with it was prior to my birth.  I was about 12 years of age before I could finally express what I remembered because of the abstract quality of my memory. I am glad he wrote the book, perhaps it will be more convincing than other NDE's becuase he was in a coma. When I have shared my memory with &#34;experts&#34;, I have been told my memory was from when I was in my Mother's womb. I doubt that. I still do not look forward to dying, but I believe that it is not the end of my soul's existence.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|My granddaughters favorite movie. We watch it over and over! But we really love it too! It was well worth every penny and more!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I absolutely love this new Soundgarden album.  So good to hear from the band again after all these years.  There isn't a bad song on this album but tracks 6 through 13 are really fantastic.  Enjoy!!!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My husband and I did not know what to think about going to this movie but it ended up being one of the best children's movies we have seen and will be purchasing this movie!  Good story and the characters are funny.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Brings out the best elements of classic Southern Rock. Elements of hard rock and country together. Their songwriting has progressed on this album, and this is easily the best Blackberry Smoke record yet.
1577314808|3.0|The book was recommended to me by my therapist.  I'm reading it a little at a time and trying to supplant the message of  now into my consciousness. It's a process! I feel less anxious every day.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Takes the Van Halen saga further down the tracks. Not as many singles on this one, but among the strongest of the early albums.
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton does it again! The story is gripping until the very last page. Brava!<br />I will certainly look for her next work.
B00000DIII|4.0|These guys do the classic garage-rock thing really well. Some catchy tunes here and lots of cool fuzz tones inside.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Definitely a seies I recommend to friends.  This is a way to learn and understand the British culture.<br />The costumes are beautiful, the interaction between the main characters is superb, and the Dowager Duchess gives such a wonderful interpretation of the complex time in the social structure at the time.
B00829GFZ0|5.0|Rival Sons are very popular in Europe and Canada, and starting to get more attention here in the US. I ordered this CD from England because I didn't want to wait until the US release date. This album grows on me the more I hear it. Rival Sons bring back great vintage rock and roll sounds, good songwriting, and are also a killer live act! Recently met the band and they are all really nice dudes to boot. Check this band out if you haven't already. Recommended.
B00AJER3SE|1.0|Here's the second blu-ray release of The Terminator by MGM. This time it's marketed as a remaster, or a second round ripoff of the public. This film needs a complete RESTORATION. The only thing new about this blu-ray re-release is the remastered soundtrack. Don't waste your money.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|We love Family Guy so this was right down our alley.  Even my conservative uptight cousin laughed and stayed awake!<br />Seth McFarlane is so clever!
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|It has been a very long time that I have been waiting for a horror movie like this.<br /><br />Just after I watched this film, it confirmed what we all know: that gallons of blood, and weird monsters, are not exactly what makes a movie this really scary, and keep the audience so interested throughout the movie.<br /><br />Some of the things I really enjoy is the way the camera moves. Since the opening scene, the way the front of the house is presented to us, screams something very dark is going to happen. The acting is great, specially by the 'family man' (the novel writer) who knows how to transmit suspense more often than not. Very good actor choice to perform the writer character.<br /><br />After seen so much horror garbage out of Hollywood, where either one knows right away what is going to happen next, or rather than be scared, one leave the theater laughing at the silly script/poor acting, well, this is a very refreshing movie in the sense that it let us know that still there is talent left to impress us big time.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|I loved the book right up until the ending.  It felt like it ended like a sequel was needed to give more details to develop the ending and tie up the loose ends.<br /><br />I would recommend this to young adults.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I like to read books by which movies are based upon. This book was wonderfully written.. The struggles of the two main characters are written with a bit of seriousness and a bit of humor creating a lovely read. Read in a weekend in-between painting layers of my DIY tossed the kids some food every now and again enjoyed losing my weekend in this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.I play for hours in one setting.I just got my updates and enjoy them as well.I play this game everyday at work and home.my kids turned me on this game and I have been telling everyone about this game.keep the update up it makes the game more exciting.look forward to the next one.thanks for helping me pass the time.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Wow,what a great dvd collection of the series. The updated special effects are fantastic! My only query is the so-called easy to toggle back and forth from the original version to the newly updated scenes...cannot do this as some claim it can be done by a simple button push?! Perhaps human error on my part???....worth buying nontheless!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Uploaded quick to my kindle. Loved the book. Worth the read. Loved how great quick and easy it was to access from my kindle.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I have heard about these game many times over the years but never got a change to play them. Until now that is. Even on PS3 I am amazed by these game, I can't imagine what it would have been like to pick them up on the PS2. I would definitely recommend this game bundle to anyone looking for good single player games.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read the Fifthy Shades series and I thought this series was better! They were both very good, but this one was better
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this season! Amazon season pass it awesome with this season! I don't have to worry about missing an episode at all! Love Lana Parrilla, shes brilliant in this season! She deserves an Emmy for her performance in this season. :) Highly recommend OUAT to  anyone of any age! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's addictive and funner than that game temple run<br />Soo amazing I got 18 people<br />Huge amount of time and the best game ever awesomeness funnier than those<br /> games
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Was very pleased with the the way the trilogy  was ended. No disappointment at all from me what so ever.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I can't say I've ever been a Cash fan but this record made me think again. Raw, gritty, gutsy music for men who never achieved the American Dream. This record is a bit like a good documentary - makes you feel you are there, in the prison, with violence and tears just a step away.<br /><br />Great stuff!
B001DF68MA|5.0|My mother gave us this bike seat as a gift, and we have been VERY happy with it. We started using it with our son when he was 10 months old and have had no problems whatsoever. I constantly thank her for this seat because we live in Switzerland, and you can't find child's bike seats like this here. Other parents here often comment on it (because they've never seen anything like it before) and say they wish they had one, too. :)
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Have heard a number of slams of this book, but I enjoyed it and think it had an unmistakeable ring of truth. There were several details her mother left out of her own books, that Parker provided here. A fascinating read.
B00000J2PH|5.0|With her debut [[ASIN:B0000025B9 Writer]] Carole King made it clear she could,and would do it all. That is play,sing and write her own music and do it well. But she didn't do it successfully that first time. The songs were strong,the music was amazing. But there was a slightly expansive and open ended quality about some of the funkier and instrumental jamming on some of the songs that did not have the kind of concise nature that was (and often still is) associated with hit pop songs. It was more a songwriters and a musicians album than it was was something that could reach the public. By the time she recorded this second album,she'd learned a lot about how to make the music she wanted sound the way it was meant to-how to translate her ideas in a more tightly crafted fashion. Keeping company with all the singer/songwriter activity brewing in the Laurel Canyon area at the time also helped as Carole King was about to unleash the album that would change her career forever.<br /><br />  Right of the bat the first three songs are much like a Carole King hit parade:\\"I Feel The Earth Move\\",\\"So Far Away\\" and \\"It's Too Late\\" heard all one after the other makes you realize what soulful,spicy and funky these songs are with there jazzy references,strong percussion and gospel type chords. \\"Home Again\\",\\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Way Over Yonder\\",while not the enormous hit songs that begin the album are wonderful soul/folk ballads that really bring out Carole's \\"Earth Mother\\" side of the singer/songwriter movement perhaps to best affect. \\"You've Got A Friend\\",presented here in a very stark musical setting is...well of course the kind of anthem to platonic love between people of any gender we could certainly use more of in music today. One of my favorite songs of all time,actually. Whether it's Donny Hathaway,James Taylor or Carole here who sings it. That same stark and soulful setting brings Carole's older compositions like \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\" and \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\" back to life in a whole new way.<br /><br />  \\"Smackwater Jack\\" and \\"Where You Lead\\" up the tempo for some swinging,even danceable funky soul while the quiet title song tells a very reflective metaphorical Prince Charming story,one of her more poetic lyrics. Of the bonus tracks \\"Out In The Cold\\" is a great funky soul piece about the then rare mention of a woman committing infidelity and coming to regret it,followed up a live and more vocally improvised version of \\"Smackwater Jack\\". I'm sure many people have their own theories as to what makes this album such a successful classic. To me it's because Carole King always had what it took to be the major female singer/songwriter pioneer,but this was the album where all the concepts and ideas she'd had finally came into focus. There's probably never been as consistent yet well rounded example of her talents after this album,which might be why none of her subsequent releases fared quite so well. It terms of full length albums,this is still likely Carole King's major shinning moment.Woman\\" back to life in a whole new way.<br /><br />  \\"Smackwater Jack\\" and \\"Where You Lead\\" up the tempo for some swinging,even danceable funky soul while the quiet title song tells a very reflective metaphorical Prince Charming story,one of her more poetic lyrics.

B0042RUMJG|5.0|This was such a pleasant surprise, hearing Sting with a full orchestra.  We play this concert at least once a week and never get tired of it.  Clearly at the top of his game, this is a wonderful concert for anyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The 5 stars are not even adequate.  I have finished reading all 3 books and I am missing Christian Grey!!
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|A timeless work that has stood the test - watch and then look around. Philip K. Dick looked into the abyss and it looked back.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun and changes the layout enough to keep it from getting dull. Takes a little too long to get the characters tho.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game. It is so addictive and a lot of fun. I think that each time Subway Surfers relocates it should come out as a new game, so you can keep each version.Each version gets better and better.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I learned of the IPad Camera Connection Kit from a friend and so I purchased it.  I find it so easy to use and pictures are downloaded instantly from your sd card onto my IPad 2.  I am very happy with it and have absolutely no complaints.  I purchased one for my sister who has a IPad 4 so it is a different connection, but she loves hers too.  Great product.
B009G41CG2|2.0|Once you play Random Mahjong, it's hard to get into any other version. It's not really this apps fault, so I gave it one more star.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|Love it! Great beat! Deadmau5 lives up to expectations. Gerard Way sounds great in Professional Griefers. I'd rate this album better than the previous 4x4=12 - which I LOVE!
B009VB97EY|3.0|The movie was okay but nothing I would write home about.  It was too predictable with appearing to appeal to entice the viewer with more physical attributes of the actors rather than the acting ability.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is on eof a kind, I have not heard anything compareable sience Stivie Nicks. Its an amazing CD. I would recommend it to EVERYONE......................
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I really like Denzel Washington movies (not all).  I hate to see characters that are down on luck and have chosen to destroy their life and those around them.  What I did like was finally some integrity and honesty shine through.
1451696191|3.0|I purchased this book for my 14 year old daughter. She loves to read, if she likes the book she does not set it down untill she is finished. This book I have seen her reading it 2 times.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|My husband and I thought we wouldn't enjoy animated films.  What a pleasant surprise that many of these are entertaining as well as funny.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|very fun game but you have to pay to keep going. I would have loved more levels for free. worth buying. graphics are good.
B00943SQCI|4.0|Great movie and the acting was superb as per usual for Johnny Depp and his supporting actors/actresses.  He does not disappoint the viewer.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Really great music, as always, from Taylor Swift. I love the simplicity of her songs and the message they convey.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|I think with all the money spent on this movie the producers could have put it to better use than to depict the life of a self-centered deadbeat entertainer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It so much fun. It gives me something to do when i have nothing<br />to do. Its sooo adicting. But it needs more time to have a limited time character. But<br />otherwise its fun.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|While the animation was well done, the story lacked and wa more geared toward a much younger crowd than myself.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Not user friendly and still can't run flash player on the kindle fire HD. Pretty much useless. Not worth the effort.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Ok- I haven't quite finished this book but I had to put it down and write a reveiw; it's that good. I was skeptical about the format and the subject. How could anyone write even a short novel about being marooned on Mars? Seems like it'd be a short story. Every page has proven to be astounding however. The writing is top notch. It's technical without being dry, very evocative and I've even caught myself literally laughing out loud (a bit embarrassing in a coffee shop). If you like hard sci-fi this one is a no brainer, especially for the price... Mr. Weir, if you read these know that you have a new fan. Write more, please!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was simple and unlike temple run you don't have to tilt it to turn and it's just so fun
B007HACDLK|3.0|This book was ok but not as good as all the other Vince Flynn novels I have read. Nothing else to say.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I really enjoy the two maps.the road is extremely scary and the farm is a nice level as well I hope to enjoy more levels soon. In fact I have an idea for another level, what if you made an abandoned warehouse factory style map or also maybe a zoo with moving animals in the background  that would  freak you out.also this game would be just perfect with color. Please I'm hoping to see what you guys can really accomplish other than that this is truly a great game. Keep up the amazing work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing you get coins and you can buy characters to run its really know different than temple run
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is a solid alternative. Hit me up. 18 year old dude from south Carolina. Need peeps to talk to.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|beautiful prose.  captivating plot twists.  happy ending.  a jouney worth taking.  don't miss out on taking it for yourself.  you won't regret it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|AWESOMENESS I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH IT TAUGHT ME A LOT OF WORDS AND NOW I'M MORE SMARTER USING THIS BOOK
B003O86FMW|5.0|First book. I can easily recommend this book. I could not put it down. Another classic to have in the electronic bookshelf.
0425188809|2.0|I was an early fan of Dean Koontz inthe 80s but stopped reading his books in the 90s when I realized his battle of ultimate evil against Uzi-toting, ultra-good main character with a troubled past had become formulaic.  I picked this one up because, I admit it, I like dogs and hoped he had kicked it up a bit since I'd last read his fiction.  This book is same-old/same-old - it just includes a different kind of dog.  There's a lot to explore in the good vs evil theme, but Koontz doesn't appear interested in saying anything new.  He's phoning it in - not working nearly as hard on this book as he did on his earlier books and you can tell because he's inconsistent in the details and the text isn't tight.  As others have noted, there's more than a little unnecessary sermonizing.  By the end of the book, I was skipping more of the text than I was reading but don't feel I missed anything.  Formulaic fiction is fine for some - but this could have been so much more if Koontz had been more willing to challenge his comfortable but apparently successful pattern.  Koontz has been writing for long enough and has an interesting enough theme to explore that he could be producing the literary equivalent of a gourmet dinner - instead he's giving us potato chips.  I don't begrudge Koontz this easy success - but I also don't want to read his stuff unless he's going to try harder.
B005HSL626|5.0|wow. this game is so fun I could play it all day long. its the most addicting game ive ever played
B007RI56NY|4.0|I have never found a bad Train. Each CD is better than the one before, which makes California 37 Train's best
B0094BB4TW|5.0|excellent format for the kindle. easy to read and better view of pictures. apparently i have to write one more word
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A trilogy that keeps one engrossed and enjoyable reading for all ages.  I won't give away the story, so get the books and be ready not to put your book down.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Personally, I think this one is the best of the Marvel Universe movies so far.  The others have more action and wiz bang... this one had more heart and substance.  It is the only one of them that hits me on an emotional level on top of what is going on.  The character is the most likable of all on the Avengers team... even if he is as not as over the top alpha personality as Tony Stark.  I think its a great movie that does the super hero involved strong justice.  I think the other Marvel Super Hero movies were all good... but this is the one that most made me want to see it again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved the acting, the setting, the production as a whole , the costumes, the characterization of each and every person in the play and their interaction with each other. Masterpiece Theatre is the best and I love to watch every play of theirs.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game is fun. there are challenges and quests and puzzles. the friends aspect is good as they really help you with hints and gifts. but there are also serious bugs that never get addressed. like crashing on launch or having a deep sleep status even thoughyou play twice daily. I like the game but wish the authors cared more.
B003SI605K|5.0|Excellent acting. Stories take us back and forth between America and China seamlessly glimpsing the lives of these 4 mothers. Even though the movie is older, the stories and relationships between daughters and mothers and wives and husbands are timeless.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Knife is top notch, heavy, solid and a beast. Not elegant like some SOGs I own. This one will take a beating. Sheathe is killer from blade down(kydex). Above the tang its really cheap nylon with a horrible snap. Great aftermarket sheaths for this knife are available. A few buck mores and the sheathe would be perfect. So buy this knife and then buy a aftermarket sheathe and your good. Jetman
B007TNS6JI|1.0|suucks<br />suuuuuuuucks, really sucked, it blew, not fun or origional, just a ploy to rook suckers for cash, I reccomend not playing this piece of garbage
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Got the movie and it is great price for 2 disc version it worked well, that was all we needed for a gift for someone
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|perfect for creating a mobile &quot;getting things done&quot; solution. see &quot;the secret weapon&reg;&quot; website for more info on David allen's productivity solution.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|If I had to buy it, this was inexpensive and I can't afford the higher prices.  We are retired and are grateful to get lower prices on a fixed income
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|this app is great.  its really annoying sometimes because of the ads but it did get rated down one star for that..... it always tells you about the AMAZON APP!!  its like I have a kindle fire so ovasably I have that app!!!!!
B0086HGW42|4.0|This is a beautiful project. The true expression of his art shines through. I hope he stays true to himself and not delute his gift by colabing with others who just want to ride his wave.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|I have rated this book 4 stars, mainly because of the time it takes to really get into the story. The Book itself is amusing, creative and wraps you into the story. Its not something I would read again. But it is worth reading.<br />Definitely for mature audiences.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I had not watched the movie and read the book without any idea of what is was about. I felt the writing was very basic and that I probably was not the intended audience of the book – it has a very “pre-teen” feel. I was quite annoyed reading the first couple of chapters but somehow this book grew on me after a little while. The characters were very well depicted and despite the number of “skeletons in the closet” the story had a good rythm. Why not for a younger reader? 6.5/10
B008TMA1LY|1.0|My 4 year old loves Hello Kitty so I downloaded this app for her on our tablet.  She doesn't quite get the entire thing but was having fun playing around with it.  Until I realized I'd forgotten to set up the parental controls on amazon and she'd spent $62 in a very short amount of time buying costly addons to this game at $19.99 each three times because that &#34;point&#34; selection had a fun crown on top and then another couple of $0.99 addon points.  So she's now got all sorts of points to use up.  Without buying the addons it appears as though there's not much you can do with the game.  I wouldn't recommend this game.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I did not have high expectations (popular book, you know…) but I have absolutely blown away by The Life of Pi. The story was magical, very well-written, original and most importantly I felt I had discovered something when I finished the book. I am not a religious person but the lesson from the book – after all life is already gloomy let’s choose the better story – had a special resonance for me. I saw the movie as well – good but as always nowhere near as entrancing as the book itself. My favourite moment is the green island and the meeting with the French cook. I felt that there was something to take-away at all levels of the story both literal and metaphorical. I loved it. I would definitely recommend it if you have not read it yet. 9/10
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Love this cd.  Katie Perry can get your mood rockin'!  I use it to work out to and not only does it get me moving, but I love all her songs.  Highly recommend.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|After borrowing my brother's Game of Thrones, Season 1 on BluRay, I decided to bite the bullet and download Season 2 onto my TiVo.  It did not disappoint.  I was unable to stop watching and finished off all ten episodes within three days.  It would have taken less time, but I was suffering from a severe cold and had to take nap breaks every two to three episodes.<br />Wonderful characters, not for kids.  Lots of sex and violence, not to mention the seedy underbelly of humanity.  Some horrific creatures that would frighten most children.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|I like the music, but it's vinyl LP which I didn't know at the time of purchase and now I can't add it to my iPod which blows.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|The two other games are fun and very nice looking, but the main title is the reason to purchase it. Very haunting and beautiful soundtrack, game play is simple to pick up and has some nice replay value. A bit on the short side but not to the point that I feel I didn't get my moneys worth. Dynamic multiplayer co-op elements are a nice treat, feels seamless.
B008QOFOQW|5.0|Birthday present to be presented in May to a 4-year-old, but expect it will be a great hit.<br />Two granddaughters are into the Lego Friends.  Amazing how they have changed since their mother built little houses.<br />They are more complicated, but fascinating with the working parts and implements.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|I read this book with a group and am so glad I did. This book is not written in the normal conventional writing style and I loved that about it. The reader enters the world of some zany characters and plots. It's sad to me that we lost David Wallace. Clearly he had a brilliant talent that was lost to his self destruction. Infinate Jest is humorous and depressing throughout the book.  There are many details so the reader must pay attention to grasp the storylines progression.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. Best TV series to date. Nothing can beat it! I would rather watch this show all day then anything else!
B00APJLFEG|2.0|Here's the movie: Parent is overprotective, and therefore ignorant, and kids are smarter in the new ways of the world. That's about it without actually needing a spoiler alert.  I would seriously reconsider any new kids movies after the last 10 times I've seen this movie with different names. How about a kids movie where the kids actually learn something about when they're being stupid?  The way kids are today, I'd say they can benefit from that much more.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Despite the over abundance of one line inserts - it was fairly well acted - even the bear.....and very heartfelt.  The age old story of a man growing up....
B0094K1P2Y|4.0|The beginning is slow, but you will definitely be rewarded for sticking it out.  The rest is funny as hell!
B009VMN3RA|2.0|This author, although I believe the suffering she experienced at the hands of both of her parents, was such a &#34;here I am - abuse me&#34; kind of person, that I lost sympathy for her.  I just couldn't keep reading; I found myself being disgusted and angry with her for allowing her parents to continue to abuse her, even when she was able to do something about it.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|too bad that there wasn't a better actor to play the lead role of Tony Mendez.  And while I read that Mendez doesn't consider himself to be a Mexican-American, in fact he looks very much Mexican-American so perhaps having an Hispanic play the lead would have been more suitable.  But frankly I don't care if they had Denzel Washington play the lead, just have someone who can act and that is not Affleck.  He played it as if he suffered from hemorrhoids.<br /><br />As for the film, it was gripping and exciting.  I saw it in the theatre and I'm not surprised with the Oscar award, although, I also liked Lincoln.  I strongly recommend the movie especially to those who believe that the U.S. can't do anything correct.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|My son loves this game good graphics and keeps him going for hours i liked the price not bad for 1.99
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was very exciting and informative. I love movies based on true stories. Some areas were a little farfetched to be true
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I have loved this show since the beginning. The acting is superb, the interaction between Merlin and Arthur and the deep bond of friendship they have developed is a joy and who doesn't love to hate Morganna.  It is truly a most entertaining show to watch. I look forward to the next episode with anticipation.  Long live Merlin!!!!!
B001J2WNE4|5.0|I JUST HEARD THIS SONG AND IT REALLY GRABS MY BODY AND SOUL.  IF YOU DONT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE I SUGGEST THE MP3 VERSION OF \\"\\"THIS TIME\\"\\"
B00BHMETKC|5.0|My headline sums it up. I was a freshman in college when all of this started and I had no idea, of course, how skillfully it had been executed behind the scenes. Doesn't this make all you Carter haters look at him a bit more positively?<br /><br />Affleck did a dynamite job directing this, with perfect nuance and compelling action at every turn. My only gripe -- and I made a mental note of this -- was the foreshadowing of the guy hanging from the construction crane leading to a character later talking about such incidences. This is unrealistic. There would have been other things to complain about and other ways bodies were disposed of or presented before the public. At the very least, in real life someone would say &#34;and they're hanging bodies outside&#34;.<br /><br />Otherwise, a fine film and proof once again that Affleck not only deserves to be back in the game but has mastered it. And PS, if you ever doubted this go back and see &#34;Chasing Amy&#34;.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game and it's a great game to play! Anyone can play this game because it is easy and fun to play it!
