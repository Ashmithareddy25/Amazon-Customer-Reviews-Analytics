B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fairly realistic.  Keeps my nieces entertained for hours.  Quite easy to earn money and diamonds without spending real money.  Highly recommend for anyone who is a horse lover.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The treatment of this small white girl by the whites is awful.  The blacks embraced her as an outcast & taught her to live, but lost their own by doing so.  Great read.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|An amazing read. I purchased this book prior to my first batch of homebrew and am very thankful I did so. Papazian explains homebrewing in such basic terms that reading this book simply takes the edge off of getting started. I strongly recommend this read for anyone slightly interested in brewing their own beer and also for any homebrewers who haven't read it (there are probably very few who haven't). There's a reason this book is considered the Bible of homebrew.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I definitely was not expecting some of the twists to the development of the characters. I can't wait to see the movie to see how it goes along with the book.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It was full of tropes and shallow characters and relationships. I liked it because it was easy to burn through and wasn't a bad fantasy world, but the characters and concepts have been overdone, and it was too dramatic to sustain itself
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book will keep you turning pages in anticipation. It is full flavored in both romance and eroticism!  Great read!
B005HW21Y4|5.0|Review 6******<br /><br />This is the first book in the Iron Druid Chronicles. I was recommended this book by Amazon, so I thought I would give it a try. I'm glad that I did, because I loved it!<br /><br />Atticus (Siodhachan) O'Sullivan is a fascinating character. He is a druid and has the ability to shape-shift. I really liked him a lot. He has a very dry sense of humor, which appeals to me; and a gorgeous Irish Wolfhound called Oberon whom I have fallen in love with! I love their conversations!<br /><br />This book was an exciting read from page one! I found myself swept along into an adventure full of danger and magic. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing to get involved with not one but three goddesses, but Atticus does and the consequences causes more than a few problems! The Morrigan is the goddess of death, but she seems to have a soft spot for the druid. Flidais is the goddess of the hunt and has designs on getting the sword. Brighid is the goddess of poetry, fire and the forge and is determined that Aenghus Og (Atticus's nemesis) should not have the sword.<br />There are several other characters that stand out and bring this book to life, including a vampire and a werewolf pair of lawyers, and a very scary Hindi witch possessing the body of a barmaid, but I loved widow MacDonagh! Her Irish spirit had me giggling in places.<br /><br />Although I have not read any of Jim Butcher's \\"The Dresden Files\\" series, I have watched the TV series based on them. This book definitely has similarities, but there is also a uniqueness all of it's own. I am now looking forward to reading the next book in the series!<br /><br />I loved the flow of the story and, although I struggled a bit with the Celtic words and names (there is an index to help with pronunciation), Kevin Hearne has written a fast paced read that has captured my imagination and turned me into a fan!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you love YA (14+ due to some mild violence), Fantasy and Action/Adventure genres. - Lynn Wortonnd Action/Adventure genres. - Lynn Worton

B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Edgy and violent, smart dialogue and lots of twists.  Michael Chiklis manages to present a very bad guy who is the cop you want to see at your door when you call 911.
1476715904|4.0|Though I am probably twice the age of Colleen Hoover's intended audience I still enjoy reading her books.  She writes nicely and her stories flow.  I've read many of the other reviews wrote and noticed that a lot of people mentioned the poetry.  If you are one that doesn't have much interest in poetry don't let that deter you from giving this book a chance.  Yes, there is some poetry but not so much that it consumes or takes away from the story.
0131103628|5.0|I picked up my copy in 2003 by the suggestion of my teacher that had been programming since punch cards. This book gave me insight into not just what the functions are but how to use and override them. It was my saving grace through college and helped me to understand the structure for coding. I would suggest this book for anyone programming in C, C++, C++ .NET, C#, Java, and any another programming language that gives the user the control they need to wright efficient and stable code.

B006PZBR8S|4.0|If anything, Hugh Jackman can play a multitude of roles. And I give him credit for more than that... He is NOT full of himself like other actors out there. He appreciates his work and it shows.<br /><br />The film had an interesting story... And it's good it wasn't all that Good goody... Hell, even the kid wasn't portrayed as that girly-boy type Hollywood always tries to provide (think, Justin beiber).<br /><br />Yet... I won't say it was a great flick... Unfortunately because it had RAP in a couple places...  I know, it's a modern movie, I get it. But the inclusion of rap? That stuff sucks!!! And it's by no means FAMILY FRIENDLY!!! Where as the movie was.<br /><br />I think the film overall is good... except for the god damn rap. But hey, I was able to mute that out :)
0062255657|5.0|This short but bittersweet fantasy novel is set in a more or less mundane Britain in today and the recent past. It concerns a young boy (later grown) and his fascinating neighbors- who happen to be a Maiden a Mother and a Crone.<br /><br />Whimsical, phantasmagorical, sometimes poignant and with a few somewhat dark moments right out of your nitemares.<br /><br />And, a solid growing up story about a boy in England, too.
1623650003|4.0|How happy am I that Quercus has begun releasing titles in the States? Pretty freaking happy!<br /><br />ALEX by Pierre Lemaitre is part of Quercus's Maclehose Press imprint - translated lit and crime fiction - and is one of their first titles to hit shelves here. Though it's actually the second book in the Verhoeven trilogy, Alex is the first of Lemaitre's works to be translated into English and it earned Lemaitre the CWA International Dagger award this year.<br /><br />A witness reports a kidnapping and Commandant Camille Verhoeven is assigned the case. Verhoeven is a last resort - everyone knows that he won't take kidnappings since the tragic fate of his own wife - but the Divisionnaire has made it clear that there is no one else. The witness saw a man with a white, unmarked van punch and kick a young woman before taking off with her in the vehicle. Unfortunately the woman's description doesn't match anyone who's been reported missing so the only hope is identifying the man with the van. With such a common vehicle, Verhoeven and his team have their work cut out for them and time is running out for the victim.<br /><br />This is one of those books that starts as one thing and ends up something completely different. It's thriller through and through but by part two Lemaitre has turned the whole thing on its head! The twist, something I do not want to give away in the least bit, elevates Alex well beyond my wildest expectations.<br /><br />The narrative alternates between Alex and Verhoeven, both of whom are interesting characters in their own very different ways. Verhoeven, as the lead investigator, is 4'11'' and a widower whose own wife was kidnapped and killed while eight months pregnant. He's been avoiding his team and - as mentioned above - certain cases ever since, basically surviving but not really living. Alex's kidnapping forces him no only to take on a kidnapping but to once again reunite with his old team as well. And Alex, well, let's just say that the reader learns as much about her as the police do as the story plays out.<br /><br />ALEX did start off a bit clunky in my opinion. Rest assured, the narrative begins to smooth out a bit around the fifty page mark and really hit its stride (for me) just before breaking into part two. The story moves along quickly - this was another insomnia read for me and I'd zipped through that much of the book in a relatively short time.<br /><br />While ALEX seems to be drawing comparison to Stieg Larsson's GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, I'd actually go with Jussi Adler-Olsen's Department Q series instead. Verhoeven is a bit like Morck in terms of temperament, never mind the fact that both ALEX and THE KEEPER OF LOST CAUSES both deal with kidnapping cases. Like KEEPER (and even GIRL), I should warn you that Alex is quite graphic and dark. If you're more of a cozy kind of reader this will not be your cup of tea. If, however, you include both Larsson and Adler-Olsen in your best of thriller authors list, then I'd highly suggest adding ALEX to your must-read list!<br /><br />ALEX is translated from French by Frank Wynne who was short-listed for the French-American Foundations 2012 Translation Prize. Wynne is apparently working on another Quercus/Maclehose title as well, Loser's Corner by Antonin Varenne.ader learns as much about her as the police do as the story plays out.<br /><br />ALEX did start off a bit clunky in my opinion.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I truly enjoy this game. It is a mind bender and makes you really think out your moves. Even if you solve the little puzzles you can always improve your score. I have to laugh at all the times I fall on the spikes. But I am trainable....
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Great mouse, see other reviews for why it's awesome. I'm gonna tell you about the faults, and other things not in the product description.<br /><br />1) Finding the software on their website was pretty annoying, for some reason the links I was following didn't link directly to the driver download page. ([...]<br /><br />2) The weights are pointless, I think. I spent the time trying them out, and it just feels like there are a bunch of weights near the back of the mouse. It doesn't give it a 'hefty' or 'solid' feel, just like there's something stuck there, like when you have a pebble stuck in the treads of your sneakers.<br /><br />3) As mentioned in other reviews, there are no MB4, MB5, etc buttons. You have to bind the buttons to keys. I just bound them to keys I never use in games (/=\]) because they are way far away from the WASD buttons. Also, I couldn't get the 'key combo' settings to work, but I didn't feel like bothering with it since I could just use those unused keys. Also, the extra three buttons in the middle are not very easily accessible, so don't bind them to anything you want to access quickly, or press in conjunction with other mouse buttons.<br /><br />The middle thumb button is ridged, so you can tell instantly by feel which button you're pressing. This is pretty nice and unexpected, since in the heat of the moment, you don't want your thumb to slip and press the wrong button. I can also easily pick up the mouse without pressing the thumb keys, since there is a nice groove for your thumb below. Overall, very impressed with the ergonomics.<br /><br />The software is kind of unintuitive, so expect to spend some time setting your mouse up. Once you have it working though, you'll be happy.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I debated back and forth deciding if this novel deserved 3 stars or 4. I chose 4 because of the author's strong ability to keep the reader interested. Throughout the novel, you along with Pat are uncovering his past. This made it hard to put the novel down although I didn't give it a 5 because it was sort of slow. I recommend this novel if you are interested in mental illnesses, and how they alter people's thinking.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a fun little game to play on those lazy Sunday afternoons or when winding down a long day.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book it really made you feel how young love was for your last days. I definitely shed a couple of tears and I recommend it to other readers looking for a teen romance.
1612191290|5.0|This should be required reading for every student of economics, and it's essential reading for anyone who questions the current economic order. Why are we in so much debt? Who we are in debt? What is debt anyway? What purpose does it serve? Who has benefited from it historically and who benefits from it now? Is it legitimate? How have people around the world, throughout time answered these questions? And what role could a jubilee, a cancellation of all debts, play today?<br /><br />Unlike most economics and anthropological books I've read, this one reads almost like a novel. It's that good. And it has given me so many satisfying, deep questions to think about. Truly a masterpiece.<br /><br />Inspired by this book, I've started getting involved with the movement called Strike Debt that builds off some of his work. There's so much to think about.
0385491026|5.0|I love the way this book is written, and the shipping was fast and clean. If I were to have someone read a book by Margaret. This would be one of those books.

0770437400|1.0|When I ordered this book I tried Amazon Premium just to giggles, and then I ordered the book. The book was supposed to be here around August 28th, and it is now the 3rd of September. It still hasn't left the factory for delivery, and I'm getting really disappointed. I'm hoping the book was worth the wait though, and I do not believe I'll be buying from this book company again.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|another great book from a writer who has written many.<br /><br /> this is a fable/fairy tale/fantasy for all ages, as long as you are willing to \\"believe\\". i am. and i say, get this book if you want to be charmed and amazed. i found it to be very moving, as well as charming and amazing.<br /><br />highest recommendation.
0920668364|5.0|It said that it had a few wear to the part of the book that bends but i think its in perfect condition looks like a brand new book to me and i only paid 0.01$ and then 3.99 for shipping and the brand new books were like 12$ or something total. I think this is a great deal. THANK YOU TO THE SELLER! I'm so impressed and thankful that the book is in this much great condition ill be buying from you guys in the future :).

0871164566|5.0|I do traditional wire wrapping and love it,but this book gave me options for things I would not have been able to wrap otherwise. It also gives a large amount of advice on how to use one's own creativity in adapting these designs,advice that has worked for me.  A lot of books try to give this,but this is one of the few that has succeeded for me.
B007SZQXXI|4.0|One of Shakespeare's greatest! The only flaw is a lack of a list of characters in this version as they can sometimes be difficult to keep track of.
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|There are some neat \\"steampunk\\" gadgets and I really like the actors involved in this movie, but ultimately it has a very weak story line and I'm sorry I paid to rent it. It's quite gory; it's for effect and sometimes works but most often is just pretty gross and unneeded. Jeremy Renner is too understated to make this any fun like \\"The Brothers Grimm,\\" which was a similar style of movie but worked so well because of the personalities of the main actors. If you have other movies on your list, see them first!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A fast read, yet a relaxing read...it kept my interest for sure, and was really a nice, mindless adventure.  I found the main character intriguing, believable, and not &#34;over the top.&#34; Kind of a nice change from the all-too-often intense, surreal characters in many of today's thrillers!
B002JXK5VU|3.0|Harmless fun. It's fun to watch but you will probably feel guilty afterwards. Characters are well played and the series has an underlying story thread - so you will need to watch it order.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|Tough and useful. First use and my son cut his hand on the very sharp serrated blade. Forgot that it was made to do its job!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Loved the book, very Sylvia Day, loved the characters...... but wasn't it a trilogy???? I didn't like the ending, something is missing!
B0064MGU98|3.0|I watched 5 episodes and without the always brilliant Julianna Margulies this show would have been buried long ago. Cardboard cut out supporting cast, transparent story line, every cliche in the book. Maybe it gets better but I'll watch pretty much anything she's in. Wish someone would cast in a project that is equal to her talent!
B00133KFGW|5.0|Great romantic film of a child's search for his parents and the star-crossed parents/lovers search for each other and their ultimately their child.  Hits all the right notes, with outstanding music throughout and especially at finale.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I was worried they didn't make movies like this anymore.  Jack Reacher is a great all-around movie with suspense, mystery and well choreographed action.  The story and characters are solid as well.  Not one frame of CGI (as far as I could tell).<br /><br />Tom Cruise is a highly underrated actor.  He is in top form.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was very long, slow and drawn out.  Although it wrapped the story up pretty well in the end, it took way too long to get there.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I kept waiting for the story to draw me in, and it never really did.  Parts were interesting and it was a nice little story but it just wasn't my type of book.  Maybe that the older one gets, the less &#34;magical&#34; the world seems. Which may be sad for me, but either way, the book just wasn't my cup of tea.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of the better books I've read in awhile. It felt thoughtful. The characters were interesting and likeable, but imperfect and human. The writing was poetic, but not indulgent. And the story was engaging, well-crafted and satisfying. I will highly recommend this book!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Can't wait for the next one. It is a great series and I love the characters.  The New York setting is also fascinating to read about.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|Annoying acting, unbelievable twist even for a movie it insults ones intelligence.  Wanted a refund half way through and could not wait for it to end.  I like the actors in othernroles but in this debacle of a movie it was like<br />Watching and listening to fingers on a chalk board.  Anyone giving this heap 4 to 5 stars is either working for the studio or the actors.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My boys love this app..it is fun and easy to play.  Keeps them busy when we travel.  This is a great app!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Most intuitive and accurate keyboard I've tried. And I've tried ALL of them. Try it! You won't go back. Also love how it learns from your email or social networking if you want. That definitely helps for proper names or slang you use often.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Love this movie! I loved the first movie as well. It was great to see what they did with the story and how it segued in from the first movie..
B0088W6Y7K|5.0|Love this show!!! Fabulous characters and all the actors from firefly made an appearance. That made it even better.<br />Sad it got cancelled.

B00BIVN82M|4.0|I've always loved Michael Buble's  style, and still do.  But he has matured as an artist, and while he can still croon a tune with the best of them, he offers up a little bit more of a soulful, jazz-inspired sound on some of these selections.  The joyful &#34;It's a Beautiful Day&#34;, ironically about a break-up, is sure to bring a smile, while his sensuous, low-keyed duet with Reese Witherspoon, &#34;Something Stupid&#34; smolders in a nostalgic way.  &#34;Who's Lovin' You&#34; is soulful, bluesy and a little raw, but he is classic Buble  on the  opening and closing selections &#34;You Make me feel so Young&#34; and &#34;Young at Heart&#34;.  These two tunes are upbeat, smooth and swingy, and are the perfect bookends for a nice collection sure to please any Buble fan.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed book three, just as the other two, bit I was disappointed by the ending.  Instead of the usual detailed description, the author suddenly changed and wrote in a virtually trivial manner about a large amount of time.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I am pleased with the CD.  It's old style country music.  I feel today's &#34;country&#34; music is not truly country anymore.
B00785P2QC|2.0|i like this game a little bit. it can be pretty boring though. you can't do that much though. it's more of a when your board type of game.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|This is a fun game that I got for free. Wish the free part was a little long so I can decide if I really want to spend the money on it.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I have detested every single hands free device I have every purchased, and begrudged the money spent on them.  Until now.  The SuperTooth Buddy is fantastic.  I bought it after travelling with a friend who had one, having noted it's ease of use and great sound quality.  The only thing I've had to do is be careful of turning it off because the range of the bluetooth had me perplexed regarding the lack of sound from my phone one day, due to it still being connected to my phone which was a good 10 metres from my car!<br />I absolutely recommend this product, and am thinking of buying it as a Xmas present for a couple people I know that are still being stupid and using their phones whilst driving.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Ok, now let's be honest... anyone expecting another Downward Spiral or Fragile from this current version of Mr. (Academy Award winner) Trent Reznor is an idiot. He's clearly a different person than he was when he created those masterpieces of modern music. He's *gasp* happy!!<br /><br />But there's another side to the story. Again, let's all be honest. Trent put out his absolute best work when he was depressed, lonely, isolated, and motherfu**in' angry!!  Whether it's misanthropic rage directed at the human race, existential suffering, social criticism, proclaiming god dead, or just seething in a pool of his own hate and sadness, the man is a mad genius. The man just drips brilliance.<br /><br />So here we have a happy Trent. Someone content with his life. A family man, clean and sober. Does that hinder the quality of the music he puts out?<br /><br />Yeah... at least I think it does. Because this isn't a great album.<br /><br />In fact, it's very subpar.<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing new here. The songs blend together, with no real discernible difference in the music. Much of it sounds like throwaways from Pretty Hate Machine. Just incredibly generic. No passion, no feeling.<br /><br />Same goes for the lyrics. Very unimpressive and repetitive. Lyrics that a genius like Trent could spit out in his sleep. In Two, Running, Came Back Haunted, I Would for You, Find My Way, Various Methods of Escape, Disappear. It's the same themes covered over and over. And also covered before with quality lyrics. It's like the Cliffnote versions of The Downward Spiral and The Fragile. Quick and easy, with no substance.<br /><br />A song like Everything is so bubble gummy that you can't help but enjoy it. But I like it the same way I like Katy Perry songs... almost like a guilty pleasure. Nothing special about the song and its lyrics are, well, let's move on.<br /><br />The shinning masterpiece of the album is Copy of a. Fantastic song all the way around.<br /><br />So am I upset that this album isn't great? No, absolutely not. Trent has given us more gold than we deserve. He suffered for us. He gave us an outlet to release  our depression, anxieties, loneliness, and rage. Trent has done, well... everything. He's done it all, and he doesn't have anything to prove anymore.<br /><br />He's happy now and good for him. We have enough of the old, angry Trent to fill our iPods. He doesn't owe us anything more. So let's give him a break.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|a complete collection in Star Wars , and more extra video with making.<br />but if separate to bought it in metal box, I think it will be better.
B001HN6922|4.0|good game good deal my kids love it happy I found it on here and for a good price good deal
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Yes there are only 4 newly written songs for this cd, one old Stills tune reworked into a electric rock blues song Word Game and the rest are covers. The Rides stick to the blues/rock format 99% of the time the only exception being \\"Search and Destroy\\" which they deliver with a hard rock edge better than the original (sorry Iggy but the whole Raw Power cd was mediocre compare to the live performances of the material)Stills singing dominates the majority of the cd handing the vocals over to Kenny Wayne Shepard on 4 tracks, one being the fore mentioned \\"Search and Destroy\\" the rest he handles are blues covers \\"Honey Bee\\", That's a Pretty Good Love and Talk to Me Baby, all of which are excellent. The 4 originals are all blues based and co written by the band and all of them shine. Stills covers (not the correct word owns) Neil Young's \\"Rockin in the Free World\\" going from the hard rock angst of the song to some blues leads that Neil could never do. Hopefully this is not a one off shot and the Rides continue on to create and re-invent some blues classics.
B002M9WW30|5.0|great great great box set, I have loved these movies since I first saw them as a kid. this set includes them all.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Very nice album, I love it all... I listen it almost every time and every where I go. Really nice voice
B009JBZH54|5.0|this collection is the best batman movie trilogy period. the other &#34;movies&#34; don't compare to the dark knight series. great movies,great actors
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have 0.7.4 And its worth the 7.00$ u should get it p.s. I will make a YouTube Channel on December 26 MY NAME IS THEPYROCRAFTER
B004ADH1RI|5.0|a classic in my eyes. I can watch this movie over and over and it never gets old.. its a good buy
B0034CNSFU|5.0|Thanks for the excellent service. Product purchased was as advertised. We are enjoying this. 1 2 3 4 5 6
B003ITZBVS|4.0|It's a good movie and my son enjoyed it.  I purchased it for him as a surprise gift and it was worth the wait.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Seriously a very funny movie ...Freeman, Willis, Malkovich and Mirren compliment each others characters perfectly. My teenagers loved this movie!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for next season to be available, we like all aspects of this series.  We like all the characters
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It fun and keeps you wondering what is next. Love it!<br /><br />I love the puzzles and the way it makes you use your brain.
B005PK57NU|4.0|The episodes of Season Three are watchable and addictive studies in deviousness, strategies for life, and work-life balance. Exasperation with Will builds!
B004BSFC46|2.0|The quality seems to be OK, but the use of this toy is somehow doubtful.<br />Both them based on other reviews,but our daughter, is not interested in them at all. Might be she will hold and shake them for 5 sec, but not more than that(Noe she is 17 months). When she was smaller she also was not paying attention to this toy.
0736092269|5.0|My husband is really enjoying this book.  Although he Is 73, he works out every other, he is finding<br />some good info.  Book was recommended by our grandson, who is a personal trainer.
B00C2C637I|4.0|While classic, the sometimes dated references might lose some &#34;younger&#34; readers, but is a great perspective of that time in history.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was a page turner. The way the story is written gives true perspective from the eyes of the hero author. I have read quite a few books on war history and Navy SEAL training and missions but this was the best. It taught me about the hell that these guys have to go through in order to be called Navy SEALs and the respect that they deserve. Once the story about the mission begun, I couldn't put the book down. I read the last 40% of the book in less than 3 hours and balled my eyes out. In the most intense parts of the journey, you have to tell yourself \\"this is a true story\\". 5 stars, well deserved.
B000YKG5L4|4.0|There are a lot of great songs on this one. Usually I just like a few and buy those as singles, but not this one.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Jackie Robinson shows real character and class and a depth of fortitude that is not seen in all people.  It is inspiring .
1623150825|5.0|As a 13-year veteran of professional sales training and development both on a U.S. and global format, Daniel Pink has taken the obvious and breathed some life into the information. If you are looking for a magic bullet or something brand new, you will not find it here. However, if you would like a message that needs to be repeated over and over, you will find this book incredibly helpful. People learn in so many different ways. The biggest problem I have seen evolve over the years is that people want to \\"sell\\" their ideas or products via a features-based approach! While 5 years ago this was still true to some extent and 10 years ago a necessity, in the age of the internet people can find, on their own, all of the features and benefits of a product. What they need help with in moving forward is the understanding of \\"why\\" and the \\"what is it that resonates with me\\" about the idea. This only comes from finding out the information needed first. Daniel Pink does a very nice job of outlining how to determine the need of the other person. My experience in training and development has shown me that you can teach a new concept of selling but unless the individual continues to keep it in the forefront of their mind, old habits come back and they will revert back to their comfort zone of making the sale about their agenda and not the \\"customer\\" agenda. For this reason alone this book is highly relative.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show is as good as everyone says. Just fantastic. Well written, excellent acting. Over all, 5 stars. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory is an extraordinary writer.  I have read all of her books several times and I have enjoyed all of them very much.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I am a huge fan of Tom Selleck....this is a great movie. Good twists....he tells a good story. He should have kept the dog!!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I'm so glad I finally gave this wonderful, funny an sexy book a chance! I kept seeing all my friends on GR posting about how good this book was and I'm so happy I gave it a read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a very beautifully filmed and acted English drama series.  We missed watching the series when it played on television so we decided to watch it online.  We started with Season 1 and were immediately hooked.  My husband and I equally enjoyed it - couldn't get enough of it!  We watched every evening we could (as many episodes per evening as we had time for) until we completed all three seasons.  Highly recommended.
630469654X|4.0|I saw Ladyhawke years ago and have always wanted to get a personal copy.  I forgot how difficult it is to see some of the film because it is so dark, but I think the classic love story with a twist will be enjoyed by those who like a mixture of romance, some supernatural elements and a little humor.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|A great film for turning on the creative science side of your mind. A lot about this film reminded me to keep thinking. Superb sounds and scenes. Thrills and chills
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun!<br />keeps me busy and thinking. i would definitely recommend for anyone who likes puzzles.<br />the levels get harder pretty quickly too.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It is a very good game, but I can not get it to load on my Kindle Fire HD. Works fine on my Kindle Fire. The HD can't even find it in the cloud. Glad I decided to hold on to my Kindle Fire for a while.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|works well the kindle accerated plug when strapped for time. Plug in, do what need to and a couple hours you ready to go
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This is one of the cutest Disney movies to come out in a long time. I wasn't too sure about it when I saw the previews, but it is so fantastic. It has adult humor mixed in with the kid humor. The characters are refreshingly unique, and so loveable. The casting was perfect. It is a good gender-neutral movie. My daughter (6) and son (2) (and ME and my husband) all love it!! A must own!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This was a movie I was hesitant to see, because from the reviews I thought it was just another boring flick.  Make no mistakes there will not be any Oscars or awards for this film, but it is definitely entertaining, and on a Sunday night when all the kids are asleep and all you want is a movie other than Disney or Ponies-this does just fine, lol.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is, honestly, one of the best books I have read. I didn't know anything about it when I bought it; I just wanted something to read. I was SO pleasantly surprised. It is so well written, and the story is unique. I, quite literally, could not put this book down. I recommend it to anyone I know who reads. I loan it to those who can't buy it. It is fantastic.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Everything is complicated, right? Exploring the price at which knowledge comes and the mental anguish caused to players that had no part in the decisions that were made is very wrenching.  A researcher who does not look at the ancillary results that his &#34;grand&#34; experiment will have and the impacts on his subject, his children, his wife and even the friends of his children is deftly explored.  I find myself returning to themes brought up by this book weeks after I read it.  I want to reread it.  High praise.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I wasn't sure if I should let my kids (2 and 6) watch this movie. I thought it might be too scary. While there are a few parts where they cover their eyes, it is quite a cute movie. It has a great storyline, and is great for all ages. The cast is fantastic.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|I don't know what all the complaints were about.  I loved every minute of this movie save for Pa Kent's death...wouldn't it have been better to have him die of cancer or a heart attack where Clark knowingly couldn't save him despite all his powers.  He could've easily ran at super speed, grabbed Pa and ran back under the overpass.  Alas, that's a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />Now the complaint about all the destruction in Metropolis at the end seemed appropriate at the time but I have a theory:<br /><br />1. He's not SUPERMAN as we know him..yet.  He's an untrained superhuman battling a veteran soldier.  He was completely acting on impulse against Zod, focused solely on neutralizing Zod at all costs.  The collateral damage wasn't apparent to the rookie Superman.<br /><br />2. All the damage in the fight is a very logical step in creating a motivation for Lex Luthor to want Superman dead in the sequel (and to use Bruce Wayne to do so).  Here is this alien who can destroy cities at will, why would Lex want this guy to live?<br /><br />That's why I didn't think the destruction was over the top.  Yes we all wanted to scream at Supes to lead Zod out of the city, but do you think Zod would've followed?  He would have stayed in the city continuing to kill/destroy/maim while Superman tried to lure him out.  He had to fight in the city.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this movie as a start to a bigger universe.  And Hans Zimmer's music still gives me chills.
0061906220|5.0|This is the book that started it all for me. It is still my favorite. I love every book in the Pete the Cat series, but this is the best, in my opinion.
B002JI94J4|4.0|Judging from several comments, you would have low expectations for the DVD.  We might have wanted comments from the surviving band members, but the special features are chock-a-block full of behind the scenes commentary from director and crew.  That is every bit as fascinating, delving as far as some thoughts on the ouster of Pete Best and more.  How much better than the formulaic &#34;This is a film about what this film is about&#34; restatement of the obvious that we see so much of today.  The movie works.  The commentaries give a delightful historical exposition.  I'm very happy over all.
0767802519|2.0|It's rare that in North America people don't react violently to child porn and abuse, either real or fictional. So I was very surprised by all the gushing reviews of this bizarre film by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita). I hate to say it, because the actors were awesome and ELEMENTS of the story and art direction superb, but this film made me want to throw up. I don't know if what I saw was the Director's Cut, but I was extremely upset and disturbed by the sexualization of the Natalie Portman character. Now before someone (probably a 50-year-old guy living in his mother's basement) comes raging at me with how artistic and beautiful this is, let me say that the relationship between Leon and Matilda could easily have been artistic and beautiful WITHOUT a sexual element. What is the matter with the director? It's simply gross to have a child putting on makeup and trying to seduce a man. I realize this is the fantasy of many men, but it is illegal and immoral, remember? So I don't consider an \\"art film\\" an excuse to perpetrate that nausea.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|It's a fun game. You have to try to figure out how to get out of the room and you go in another room and you get out of that one and so on.
B000FC12Z0|2.0|I read a large part of this book with enjoyment, but the ridiculous ending compelled me to comment (SPOILER).<br /><br />It is inconceivable to me that all those people would get together to take revenge on the murderer, Cassetti. First of all, over half of them are servants of the family - and it's really a stretch to imagine they would risk taking the fall of committing a murder, even if they all \\"adored\\" the 3-year-old, Daisy. (Honestly, how much would the secretary and the chauffeur \\"adore\\" some kid they probably saw rarely?) They might do it because they are forced to - knowing that the rich and titled people in the scheme could easily let them be convicted if things go awry.<br /><br />And that's my other major objection: how many people, especially out of that percentage, could really go up and cold-bloodedly stab someone? It's physically hard to push a knife in someone. However upset they were at the time of Daisy's death, it's pretty hard to imagine an ordinary person being able to stick a knife in someone like that. I think it's the height of British upper-class snobbery to assume that the servants would be willing to help commit murder for the sake of a child of the rich household.
B008602KQI|4.0|If the last 30 min. of the movie were better i would have rated 5-STARS. Overall entertaining, just a lame, quick rap up.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I got this app for free via Amazon, I read all the reviews first and was a wary. A large portion of the previous downloaders said that there were ads all over the paid version (which is what I got for free), so I wasn't to sure about it, but I went ahead and got it anyways just to see for myself. The only thing I noticed was the company page where you can choose to download other titles by that creator/company. Maybe they have updated it since? I'm not sure....<br /><br />Anyway, this is the prefect mahjong game. I've been looking for a good, high quality, and interesting mahjong app for a long while now. This has multiple modes including a classic, endless, and a neat story mode about a man searching for artifacts and has to prove his worthiness though the game of mahjong. There is a pleasant and relaxing oriental song that plays throughout the background during play as well.<br /><br />If you like mahjong, puzzle games, or anything of that sort... Make sure to check this one out! :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am in a career where I come across a lot of business people so when I ask them how tech savvy they are. I suggest evernote. They usually say &quot;  Yeah I downloads it and never knew what to do with it. I respond with.a little of my own exposure to it and that's it. They too become users. I teach them how it's used and walk away. It's that simple.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I don't watch many television shows religiously, but this show has me hooked.  It has a good mix of comedy and drama, without being too cheesy or too boring.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had this game for a year and still love it !it updates all the time and makes it better .no reason to complain it's a really good app for $7&middot;Anyone with love it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Yeah ok ok in on in food zip laugh zipper visit Wii ha goog fire eternity go so Vinci ought so sick
B008XG1X18|2.0|I'd like it a whole lot more if it didn't always freeze and have problems.I love pinterest but wish it would work when I access it.
B009SH5JS4|4.0|See it for Kline.  Meg Ryan is fine, but nothing special (plus, she looks like Ellen DeGeneres for most of the movie), but Kline is a ton of fun as a Frenchman, obviously relishing the accent.  Their chemistry's not bad, and it moves at a good pace.  The transfer is nice, though it's not going to make you feel like you're seeing the movie for the first time (see The Quiet Man for that).  It is disappointing that there are no extras (maybe a trailer?).  Would have been nice to have something from the filmmakers.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Very good game, great fun. I really enjoy playing it.<br />Only thing I can do is to recommend this lovely game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is very funny many game is excellent, four stars for this app. Good bye my friend. Install this app
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Excellent game! I was suspected many and many problems after opinions of the rather players of this game. This opinions was not thrusting. Game is samething between Random Mahjong and the classic one. It is much, much better then each of them.<br />I RECOMMEND IT, THIS IS THE MUST HAVE ONE.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great movie, it was included in top list of one of the best movies of '80 s.... also a good time to remember Cindy Lauper!!
0688014291|5.0|when this book was suggested to me, I had no expectations. the book was very enlighting and to the point. I enjoyed every moment of reading it and will highly recommend it to other Managers.
B000002L61|5.0|This is a excellent album. Vivian Campbell is great. It shows what a great guitar player he has always been. Thanks Ronnie James found him for us
B005HSL626|3.0|Fun to play. Watch out for the bombs.  It has frozen fruit which allows you to slow the motion and get more points
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|I loved this book enough to read it straight through, you know what I mean--exclusively, which I don't often do. Then, at a particularly grizzly intersection, I just did not want to finish it. I was truly horrified, but then I guess if you don't want horror, don't read horror, crime fiction. I'm glad I did finish it. Kudos to you Ms. Flynn for an excellent, unfathomable plot, it was simply jaw dropping. I'll be picking up more books you write. However, please remind me, often,  never to do anything to piss you off!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Two great big stars making great music and a cool love story to go with it! Loved it then, love it still.
1609611543|5.0|Great book, though the first two thirds of it reads more like an advanced science course.  Have been weaning myself of wheat and plan to try a one month wheat feed experiment beginning mid-September
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This is wonderful!  In college taking algebra.  Easier than using a key calculator.  Love the touch design and the features it has.  Makes solving problems so much quicker!
B00E981K1W|4.0|Great material. Well thought out and wonderful illustrations.<br />Would have given 5 stars if book was searchable and followed other kindle ebook interface conventions.
B00CUG8GAS|5.0|Although parts of this book are hard to read, especially those that describe Fuller's parents' casual -- and in some cases unfathomable -- approach to raising their children, the story is captivating, with characters and settings that invite you into her hardscrabble childhood in Central Africa.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|My husband really loved this show.  I thought it was a bit too voilent, but if you like very gritty cop dramas (think &#34;The Wire&#34;) then you will like this.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|A truly realistic look at the boiler room operation.  Reminiscent of the environment found in a penny-stock brokerage operation.  Cut-throat and exciting.  Not to everyone's taste but if you like it you'll probably love it.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|CGI overkill without a shred of believability. &#34;Red Tails&#34; (2012) goes down in a hail of tired clich&eacute;s. If you want to see a film about the Tuskegee Airmen, look elsewhere. What was George Lucas thinking?
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I own 2 cats and an outside cat who has adopted me.  All have been rescue cats and I soooo related to this book!!  I highly recommend all pet lovers read this book!  I believe you'll enjoy it from start to finish.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|Lovely send up of utilitarianism. life in small town England, and buddy cop/spaghetti westerns.  If you have not seen it, then you are saying &#34;what?&#34; but, no really, it all makes sense, and, it's funny.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very enjoyable game. Challenges are interesting. Highly recommend. I like the added jewel quest in each level. Looking forward to further games from this group.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|great family film and timeless adventure. Any age will enjoy the movie. It is a story of hope, adventure and friendship.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I have become hooked on the story of the many Kings and their desire to sit on the Iron Throne. The story has many plots, many characters, and many surprises so far.
B008F5Y7UQ|4.0|This is a great humorous and wonderful story. It was such a wonderful tale of vision and trust. I really enjoyed it.
157421327X|5.0|this is a great book really shows you some good zentangle design and I really like it and will try and get some of the other books
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I moved TVs around and waited a month for the arrival of my Chromecast.  Easy five minute set-up and you are viewing Youtube and hundreds of other internet videos through your home TV.  I installed it, started the setup and halfway in I got this message:<br /><br />&#34;Learn More: AP Isolation is enabled<br />Your Wi-Fi network configuration prevents devices from communicating with Chromecast.

Checking on the net I find that this happens to a number of modem configurations, how many, I don't know 10% 30%.  As I read about this device I never saw anything written by Google about this defect.  A company like Google should be ashamed for releasing a product like this which is obviously not ready for the mass market.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|A fabulous book to read and a very special cat to share his life with a person with a need to be wanted.
B0089PWU2E|5.0|What was it Bob Seeger said??? &#34;I like that old time rock and roll&#34; Hell, yes, the '50s were a great time to grow up and Rockers like Holly made it magical.
B0019IIPZO|4.0|Enjoyed  the concept of interstellar space travel and risks associated with crash landing on a strange planet. Interesting that they had a prison transfer on a commercial flight. If you are a Vin Diesel fan it is a must see.
B0036K3OFY|5.0|Love this movie! Saw it back when it opened at the theater. Great action and eye candy. What more could a lady ask for?
B0009UC810|5.0|I just had to quote the Queen, Areatha, from her incredible scene in the soul food restaurant. Just one of the many highlights of this movie. James Brown preaching like no other man of God, &#34;How much for you women,eh?&#34;,  &#34;well we are the Good Old Boys&#34;,<br />  1060 w. Addison. on and on. Chicago sparkles and shines through this crazy and hilarious gig.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just love this series. Mixing historical events with the story line is important to me. It keeps it realistic.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Easily one of the best shows!  Not sure why I missed this one? It's phenomenal. Right up there with a show like mad men.
B005544TRQ|5.0|To me it is like a combination of Ally Mcbeal meets Good Will Hunting!  Addicted to this show.  I need season 3 to be free, Amazon!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is a great show for kids. It is funny and Shaun's adventures are unique. All the toons are great. My kids love it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The last time I read Neil Gaiman was 20+ years ago. Good Omens was one of my favourite teen novels and I greatly enjoyed the Sandman comics but drifted into other things since. Revisiting artists from one's youth is fraught with danger, especially new material. Will they have grown the same way you have grown? Browsing the kindle store I read the sample on a whim and it sucked me right in. It's not a long-winded story, but it's all the better for it. It feels crafted; every word in the right place. I was not disappointed!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Amazing book. Stephen King is more my hero for writing this book than for any other piece he has written. So enjoyable and informative. Love it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|what's not to love.......easy to use with big numbers,  easy access and tutorial for function you are not familiar with.
039472903X|5.0|Although old school, this book hits the nail right on the head.  Extremely informative and a go-to book if you ever needed inspiration.  Great purchase that won't keep you disappointed.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|You tube viewer provides an exciting way to watch your favorite videos. The pictures are easy to download and view, and you Tube provides a lot more background than some of the others. I also do not experience interruptions and other ads while viewing the video.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Sons of Anarchy started out for me as a series that made me really uncomfortable. I like uncomfortable. As the season went on I was totally hooked. Katy Segal is amazing - the whole cast is amazing. The story line [opposing groups/politics] is hard to follow once you are into the depth of it, but the complexity of that is the challenging placeholder. This series rocks! Did I say I love Amazon prime?
B008MM9630|5.0|I used to pay farmville and a ton of other games but this one has kept my interest for hours. Yeah some items needs gems which you need to buy but paying a dollar every one in a while isn't much for the entertainment it brought me. In fact after this review I'll be going back to pay some more.. :)
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love candy crush, you play the game and you hate it but you love it. You think you're going to pass to the next level but you don't, the game is so fun to play.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|The books are fast paced and just technical enough to get you involved in the world building. In every book I have read so far Weber provides a gut wrenches that has you rooting for Honor the whole way and sharing her pain. His morals are quite obvious in all his books from the welfare state of the Peeps and the religious fanatics of Grayson and Maseda. Great writing, I wish I would have read these books sooner.<br /><br />I see a lot of cry baby bad reviews from religious people. Bet they don't know that Weber is a minister. They seem to feel the harsh treatment of women by the fundies in the book are a poor reflection of their values. Take every part where they talk about god being angry at a woman's autonomy and replace it with homosexual. Then you will see just how tolerant your beliefs are. Personally as an Atheist I don't see how any star faring race could still be religious, because magical thinking gets you nowhere. But even the &#34;Christians&#34; in his books are more agnostics and the only time the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned is as a expletive.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Worth watching.<br />Denzel is great.  On the edge of my seat the whole time.  Doesn't have an expected ending. Applause.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|A little slow in some parts but otherwise entertaining. Morgan Freeman should have had a larger part. Love the tech toys!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Too many musicians and bands are coming up with tunes that are unoriginal, formulated, and resort to the lowest common degenerate in order to sell their gimmick songs.  Then comes Lindsey Sterling.  She has real talent. She actually writes and composes her own music.  It's new, refreshing, and good.  Granted, mixing the violin with dub step sounds is not a main stream genre, but it is wonderful to hear.  Every song on this album is incredible.  Buy it and be pleasantly surprised.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|This review is a little biased because I got to see him in concert and it was amazing!  I have watched so many YouTube videos and I truly love to listen to him play.  He has talent and the way he can play any type of music and make it sound wonderful on a violin is fascinating and inspiring.<br /><br />His album \\"David Garret\\" is a masterpiece and so is this one!  This album is so diverse from the modern renditions to classic pieces and to my favorite Celtic jig!  Every song is played so beautifully and with so much heart that it is hard to not appreciate his talent.<br /><br />And as for some people who have reviewed him as \\"selling out\\" because he is playing modern pieces like Justin Timberlake, I say keep it up David!  I think he is doing a great thing for classical music by developing a younger fan base.  He is amazing at playing the classical pieces but what may draw the younger crowd (minus his good looks) is his ability to play songs that they know!  I know I wouldn't necessarily be able to tell a Beethoven piece, but he mixes these greats like Bach in with Coldplay and Queen and its so much fun to listen to!  I think what he is doing is bringing in everyone for he truly loves the violin and its beautiful to listen to.  If you are on the fence about him, listen to his samples, then buy his cds because I have them all, and continue to love each and every one!
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|I love Rod Stewart and always have!  I've never missed a concert when he's in town and I saw him in Las Vegas.  He had a cold but still rocked it!  This is a great Rod Stewart.  It brought me back to his beginnings and why I fell in love with him!  Keep them coming Rod!  You are truly a remarkable man!
B0086221SS|2.0|There were a few redeeming moments, but all in all I found Michelle Williams's character to be so annoying and Seth Rogan's character to be a wimp. The plot wasn't that great. Sarah Silverman was funny, but not enough to save it. Not worth my 2 hours...
0596805888|2.0|I was not happy with this book. Was more of a filmic than a fun filled cook book.  Definitely need to be a geek to go along with this book I uses!
B00A285OOW|5.0|great,,, loved it , was a great read,, couldn't put it down, enjoyed it very very much, great great great
0307743659|4.0|I purchased this specific version of THE SHINING because the image specifies an excerpt from the (at the time of this review) upcoming sequel.  The product received did not match the product photo or description, unfortunately.  No big deal, but a little unsatisfying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the graphics, as well that you can interact with the horse a lot. Love the the games and its graphics.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|the chemistry between these two is great, I have never been too much of a Timberlake fan but he can be funny
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wasn't ready for it to end.  Was hoping for a little more tooth.  Like the format of each person's perspective each chapter
B005LAIHPE|3.0|its an okay movie, Brooklyn Decker is hot. story line is ok, pretty action packed too. I recommend seeing it at least 1 time
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game easy to play lots of available neighbors to add i also like the fact you can acquire acorns without purchasing them
B002EHM58C|5.0|This was my first foray into their music - a true Classic!  Recently purchased as MP3 to mobile listening.  The best.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love this version of Jane Austen's book Emma. BBC does amazing work with their shows. The story is enjoyable
B006IYG5HE|5.0|After reading The Devil's Star first, I was very curious what came before.  Where did Inspector Harry Hole start?  Perhaps due to some bad reviews of earlier books, including the introduction of Harry Hole, and good ones for The Redbreast, I decided to read it.  It still didn't answer all my questions, but it introduced Harry to Rakel and Oleg, introduced us to Ellen, Harry's fellow cop whom he respected so much (maybe even loved a little), and why he was so determined to find her murderer.  The rest of the novel was clearly written to string us along, asking more questions, and, even nearly to the end, keeping us not quite sure who was who.  We were learning things as Harry was learning them.  But I never guessed the ending, and you won't either.  I challenge you.<br /><br />The flashbacks to the 1940's bothered me until I figured out that the novelist was dropping hints I never got.  But it all comes together.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Kevin Spacey is fabulous as the conniving House Whip. He speaks to you breaking the fourth wall, letting you in on the wicked fun.  Can't recommend more!<br />You like political intrigue?  Like webs of information, plots and people ? this is for you.  It doesn't feel like a costume drams or a bunch of gratuitous T and A. These are real fleshed out people with strengths and weaknesses.  love it!
B005D4YGXK|5.0|My dad has terrible ankles. Bought these before we went to the beach for 10 days. He wore them in the salt water to swim everyday, in the sand on the beach all day, everyday.  They seem like they can handle a beating.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|A classic for those who grew up in the 2000's. One of the wittiest comedies on TV, and definitely elevated intelligence in many of the jokes. Will be watched over and over.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|I bought this because I really liked several songs, and liked or didn't mind the others. I listened to it on YouTube first.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|A lot of people believe you need a super huge Rambo knife when camping. A lot of people also believe that a lot is one word. I am neither of these people. This knife is a great size for camping and doing delicate work, as well as being able to chop things that bigger knives can. Highly capable, and very sharp right out of the box.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing touching book with appropriate child and adult lessons. Touching characters and relationships. Love how the story is told from different character points of view.
B001J710Y8|5.0|family enjoyed this movie, mystery, suspense throughout the entire movie, will be watching this again, thank you amazon for another hard to find movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a fun and challenging game.  i like puzzles and working to figure things out. could easily spend hours playing games like this.
B0080BFWAE|5.0|A great family movie, second family generation have now viewed this movie and the children love it as much as we did the first time it was released, thank you amazon
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is totally addictive, can't put it down. Really love the format,but have to limit myself as the diamonds seem to disappear really quickly, still can't put it down though!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This Is a very fun game however you should be able to get coins for hints easier and it shouldn't cost so much coins for one hint.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I give this a 5 out of 5 because i just couldnt put it down! From the very beginning the author sucks you in and your hooked. The story moves along realtivly quickly with out skimming details but still maintaining the mystery and intruige of the greater story line.<br />Mixing elements of fantasy, history and the modern world the book has a little bit of something for everyone. The characters are unique and well developed and the main guy is INCREDIBLE!!!<br /><br />I cant wait to read the next book.
B00CATONCA|5.0|What a perfect addition to my collection. Best looking box set I have owned. It actually has water in it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very good. COULD NOT PUT THE BOOKS DOWN. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIES.  LIKE THE GUY WHO IS GOING TO PLAY CHRISTIAN GREY.
B005FQE2E4|1.0|Was somehow convinced there would be some substance to this \\"series.\\"  Not.  It's a \\"wanna be\\" Far Side.  Sure, some of the cartoons are...hmmmmm...less than whimsical.  But, not worth the money.  It is all, nothing but, cartoons (most of which are not even that funny).  Got (I hope) my refund.  Do not let the description<br /> mislead you.  Sorry, Dude.  Keep at though, you have potential.  You're just charging too much.
006224454X|5.0|\\"No treasure house of recollection, no wealth of experience, no accumulated wisdom to pass on. What are we, if not an accumulation of our memories?\\" ~ pg. 111<br /><br />Christine Lucas is a 47-year-old anterograde amnesiac who cannot remember her past or form new memories. Her memories are lost every time she goes to sleep. Every time! Her name, age, past, family and friends are forgotten overnight. She heavily relies on her husband Ben and Dr. Nash. But are they telling her the real story or just an easier one? Does it even matter because once she goes to sleep and wakes up, it will all be forgotten anyway. This has been Christine's life for the past twenty years. The story unfolds as Christine tries to find out details of the mysterious accident that left her in this state, and whom she can trust.<br /><br />Occasionally, I purposely read a book slow because I do not want it to end. I am not ready to part with the characters. I want to slowly unfold the mystery or storyline. Before I Go To Sleep is that kind of book. It definitely qualifies as a page-turner but was best enjoyed reading at a steady slow pace...until I reached about 91% and kept repeating, \\"OMG! OMG! OMG!\\" as I turned the ePages. The ending completely threw me for a loop. And when it was over, I longed for more! Now that I've reached the end, I am only left with the memory of enjoying this good read.<br /><br />S.J. Watson made quite an impression with this debut novel. I don't know where the author got the idea from but it is such a peculiar yet possible way to live. How sad to have no accumulation of memories. What a unique, well-written psychological thriller.<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Excellent reboot of the series. Wish C.E. had had anther season. He really fits into the 50 year method well
B001NLCBJI|3.0|Although tells the real story of people who are forced by life circunstances to adapt to a a different culture, it is plain due to the very abstract topic that addresses
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My eight year old grandson loves them. Lots of small pieces not suitable for toddlers. Can't wait for more mine craft sets!
B003PWH4JA|5.0|This album is a 5/5 and becomes a 6/5 if you can find the bonus track, \\"She Loves You\\".  Gaslight's earlier albums are definitely good but felt just a tiny bit forced (see Brian's vocals on \\"We Came to Dance\\" off of \\"Sink or Swim\\", for example) but everything about American Slang from start to finish is again, fantastic.  Just make sure you get that bonus track and you're all set for every windows-down car ride for the rest of the summer.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Interesting show.  You have to hold aside the fact that the backstory is incredibly unrealistic but the show is enjoyable and the characters are well developed.  I like the show a lot.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great mystery novel with a mix of romance! I can not put it down! Heard rumors about making a movie.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Dr. Panda games have now been a standard for my daughter.  When a new one comes out, it is a no-brainer for us to buy it for her.  She finds a new one and excitedly brings her tablet to me and asks for it - no problem, I know it's a good game and she will enjoy it.  Dev is cool too and has responded directly to us if we had an issue.  You won't regret getting this game for your kids.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|It's not the most realistic portrayal of lawyering I've ever seen but it makes for great drama.  Harvey is by far the most entertaining.  On a side note, I know that Jessica is a founding partner of their firm but someone will have to explain to me what it is exactly she does there other than piss me off while I'm watching.

1878424319|5.0|The book was good and in good condition. It did take a long time to get to it's destination. Overall I was pleased.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I've never read a Arthur C Clarke book that I didn't like. Kept my interest and caused me to think about what the story actually meant. Read and see what you think
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is an excellent example of homespun entertainment.  Weighty enough to be entertaining while at the same time light enough to not feel the need to use murders, killings and cursing to get one's attention, this is just excellent, family based recreation.  My highest recommendation!
1936891026|5.0|This book is a must for any creative individual.  It is inspiring, funny and right on.  You'll love it - do not put off buying it!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Got them as a gift for my father and he loves them. They provide awesome sound for the price, and look quite stylish as well.
1451673442|5.0|That's the precept behind this book, and it is 100% true.  I had a job I hated and a boss I hated, and the only thing I could think to be grateful for was that I have a job in this economy and that my boss is the one who provides it.  I started thanking God for those two things every morning.  Within a week, my boss' entire personality changed.  I began to see actual human qualities in her, and found more and more things to be grateful for.  Inside of a month, I loved her and my job was much more bearable.  She and I have become good friends.  It really is magical.
B00000IZOR|2.0|it looks cute and when one pulls it its eyes close and open. But the cord of the phone is too small. if the phone is placed on the table the receiver will not reach the child's ear until he holds the phone in his hands. It doesn't make any ringing sound or any hello or bye sound when u lift the receiver. Over all am not happy . But my son liked it however doest use it much
0061537969|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books.  It is absolutely believable and touching.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone, male or female, who has ever loved a dog.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Love love love it.  I'm so upset I didn't start it when it was originally airing.  The story lines, characters, etc all keep me glued.
B00AO9NDY2|5.0|Love this movie/documentary/ expedition- moving on many levels- which is why I bought it and all of Ron Fricke's work.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|A fun game, but not enough options for the fights.  It is still worth playing, kills some time. Great for kids.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Judi Dench once again tops my list of British actress as well as Maggie Smith. They are just the British actresses that I like and always will.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|This movie just drags on and on and hardly arrives and anything noteworthy - certainly not 'timeless' like the description said.
B00957T6X6|4.0|A slow beginning but quick to pick up the pace. This is definitely a race to the throne with a maze thrown in the mix! Cannot wait for the next book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've known this game ever since it came out. It's super addicting and my friends and I love it!!!<br />  I have some really good ideas for future updates:<br />- Breeding<br />- Iron doors<br />- Boats<br />- Fishing rods<br />- Enderman<br />- Wolves<br />-  Etc.  Thanks :):):):)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun!  Only  issue  issue i have with the game is that it is sometimes difficult to get the touchscreen to react the way you would like it to.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I thought it was a really good movie.... better than return to oz..  I liked the change from black and white to color.... and the special effects
0743497465|5.0|Once again, Dan Brown held me captive through this book...........his style always makes me unable to put down his book until I've consumed every last word............this was NO exception.............worthy of reading more than once to 'own' all the subtleties and nuances .
B00DV3A84G|5.0|There's not any bad song in this album,  I'd heard Bastille by first time when pompeii was released and his voice and their sounds are outstanding, I didn't think twice in purchase the cd now I'm overjoyed for get a physical copy of Bad Blood
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Once again G5 nails it! If love  a little adventure with your Mahjong this is the game for you. Very easy and relaxing and safe for the whole family. G5 You Rock!
B00DM7HAGA|4.0|Everything you need to know, from the workings of the camera and how to use it for best results. Makes a daunting task a pleasure !<br />Can be recommended to every photographer, from amateur to professional.
034580404X|5.0|these books was great besides the sexual stuff. the story was great as well. cant  get over how easy it was to read
B000UJ48U4|3.0|In Eyes Wide Shut (1999), Dr. Harford (Tom Cruise) went to the Rainbow costume boutique to purchase a cloak and mask to attend a masquerade (i.e. orgy). While perusing the racks, Milich, the owner, discovered his young daughter having a three-way with two middle-aged Asian men. When Milich violently confronted the Asian men and said,\\"Couldn't you see she's a child?\\" They informed Milich that his young daughter had invited them to the orgy:<br /><br />\\"Are you crazy? We were invited here by the young lady.\\"<br />\\"This is preposterous. The young lady invited us here?\\"<br /><br />Although, Milich didn't believe the Asian ephebophile's claims, their claims are very realistic. [[ASIN:B00B6KKY1S The Allure of Nymphets]] shows that, contrary to popular belief, most age-discrepant relationships are initiated by nymphets. However, thanks to feminists, ephebophiles need to be aware of the age-of-consent laws in their respective states.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut  was based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 Dream Story. I'm going to read the novella to see if the scene in question is in the book or if Stanley Kubrick added it randomly to the script.
1452126607|5.0|I love Tardar sauce! Love all the pictures:) I get a good laugh looking at it! Caan't wait to use it..Thank u&#60;3
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Matthew Mc had me cheering for a murderer. I don't think his character was very bright but he had a good, caring side.  Reese Witherspoon was superb.  I also loved the two boys...perfect coming of age characters.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The graphics were very clear.  Puzzles medium hard.  Fun with variety of puzzles.  Hidden objects could have been more difficult for adult.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I really like this band and this is an exceptional album.  (9 more words required)  my review, I should choose the number of words.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am really enjoying this season. I feel like I finally know and care about the people.  The characters are getting more complex. Hope it continues to get ever better.
1932100660|4.0|This is a nice book on diet and disease. However, the authors do not take into account gut microorganisms (ten times in number over the cells in our bodies) or fructose consumption. (HFCS and sucrose) We see that China (9/2013) has 11.6% of her adult population suffering from diabetes, more common than in the USA. Heart and cancer morbidity in China should likely follow. It might be too simplistic to just say a vegan diet will solve our health problems. A major flaw of the book is the unanswered question: which amino acids (or peptides) in animal protein are offenders?  \\"The China Study\\" is a start in improving our health, but not the only answer to diet and good health.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Will be using this and another Wubbanub as a decoration on a centerpiece diaper cake and (ultimately) a gift for BFF's baby shower. These are small - perfect for a baby - I ordered a larger stuffed lion to sit on top of the cake as the topper. I wish the pacifier part came wrapped separately for hygiene's sake. FYI: This came packaged in a crinkly plastic bag with a cardboard tag. Not very pretty packaging, but you could make it cute!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|This is what the original movie should have been.  One of the best action movies of the year, and it's a tragedy there will not be a sequel.
B00ENYR5SY|4.0|Yes, it's a Hollywood rendition and not completely factual based on the life of John Nash. It is still a beautiful, well-told story.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Loved the series and all it's torturing twists. Wish it could have been longer. BUT...<br />It was depressing and left me feeling empty when I finished. If it had stayed more on topic, it would have been much better. Also, it cleared nothing up. The ending could turn into Alice in Wonderland for all the clarification I got.
B006P96PAO|3.0|We loved the story, theme and message- very powerful.<br /><br />I thought it went a little long, but very good movie.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|I didn't watch the movie; but, my son  did and he liked it.  It's really hard to rate something that you haven't watched.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|This is an amazing movie, and I think most Batman fans should see it. I do have some slight problems, though. One such issue is that it does kind of take away from the interestingness of the Joker by giving him a definite origin, but at least it sticks to the most widely believed claim and I can look past it, but it would be a lot more interesting if they went with a multiple choice past. I also didn't care for the subplot of Joker being in love with Vicki Vale, but maybe it's just me and in any case they don't play it up as a major plot point, and one of their scenes together is, admittedly kind of cool. Otherwise it's a great movie, there are some cool fights, there's some mystery to Batman and Bruce Wayne, and the Joker does something that only a well-done Joker can; be funny and scary at the same time. &#34;Tell me something, my friend, you ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?&#34;, spine-chilling. From what little I've seen of The Dark Knight, the Joker does the funny and scary thing too, but I prefer the emphasis on the funny from this one. All in all, it's great film, watch it if you haven't yet, you won't be disappointed.
B00COHGOP2|5.0|The actors for this movie were perfect for these parts. Loved the movie. I did not like the bad language.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Good book! I have to say it's not as good as the other three in the series, but certainly worth the read.
B0000524E5|5.0|This was a great movie along with the music. Teaches you no matter rich or poor can putt their music together.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is by far the best in the series! I can't wait to start the next book!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Love this social site. All the professional tools you need to get another job, etc; Have meet interesting people. Great for careers
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great book! Much better then the television show with non-stop excitement.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B00BEYYO8U|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever and this movie, as well as the other two proceeding it, proves it.  Without giving away any of the plot let me just say it Craig is up to the challenge.  The writing, acting, direction and effects are superb.<br />I had given up on Bond flicks for quite a while before Craig was crowned the new title of 007 and he certainly deserves it.  Not only does this movie have all you would expect as far as danger, beautiful women, gadgets, it has possibly the worse villain in modern movie history-the oh-so creepy moth-man guy from Silence of the Lambs, impeccably acted I might add.  Of course M is amazing in this flick as well...<br />I definitely suggest you give this flick a try!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story. I love the way it makes you stop to think. I would recommend this book
B005K17RU0|4.0|WONDERFUL WAY TO CHECK WEATHER CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE I HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  AT A GLANCE ALL MY SPECIAL LOCATIONS ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS APP.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The update sucks for building this blows. It was better before and why are there no way to get to the nether. How do you get to the nether?
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Great story. Great characters. All in all a great film. I'm not one to divulge storylines so to spoil the enjoyment of the film. So I'll just say this is a coming of age story executed masterfully by one hell of a storyteller. And the two lead boys in the film are very exceptional indeed. A definite watch in my opinion.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|This just mentions random things you can do with Js and html5. It doesn't have any code examples or anything past a brief description.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|If you like magic shows you should like this movie.  The movie employs many techniques to misdirect you the viewer which gives you a feel that you are a part of the trick.  At least that is my impression of it.  The action is not so much action (violence) but thrilling scenes.  The acting was decent and the story was good too.  They left it off where this could potentially become a series which might be nice.  I figured most things out but the ending I didn't see coming.  It was one of my ideas in the beginning but with so much misdirection by the end I was fooled like everyone in the film.  The tricks they perform would be amazing to see live if this was real.  It mixes elemnts from a lot of diffirent shows and movies.  You could think of the team in a kind of leverage (the show) type of way.  It also had some elements of national treasure which might spoil some things so I wont go into detail.  I however didn't see it being anything like oceans so don't try and compare the two.  Some things are predictable so when you get to the part with them debunking the rabbit trick think of the movie in the same way.  They show you some things so you don't see others.  Overall I liked the movie but I watched it for entertainment so I felt entertained.  I didn't like the ending for the reason it left me thinking \\"that's it?\\" so if they don't make another movie I will be sad.
B00E1LAS42|4.0|Leonardo does great, the movie is a winner.  The movie is a great upgrade to the book.  The photography is excellent!
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|I like the series, skip past the tedious introduction with each episode.  Good for binge watching, great detail, authentic.  Will watch all I can get.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|I expected more action. It was a very slow movie, LOTS of talking not much action. and many of it was a little unclear.
0064471837|5.0|I've adored both Sabriel, and the novel, ever since I was little and so wholly recommend this book to anyone between the ages of 12-80. I just love it and think it is one of the most creative stories ever written! Waiting patiently for the next instalment, Clariel, to come out for the past 5 or more years - that's dedication! Thanks Garth Nix.
0823003590|4.0|I took a class in portrait drawing recently.  When I asked the instructor about a book, he recommended this one.  I'm using it more as a reference and review than a book for learning.<br /><br />I find the author's explanations of principles and techniques quite understandable.  It helps me remember instructions that didn't stick very well in class.  I'm not sure that I would be able to learn to draw portraits from this book though.  Not the book, just me.  I feel the class helps a lot.  To me, there is no substitute for the EXCELLENT instruction at 'the Drawing Studio' here in Tucson.<br /><br />The author's method just works for me.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Awesome in 3d!! Felt like I could walk into my tv and swim in the ocean in my living room.
B0012RCMH4|5.0|Tom gabriel fischer is an amazing artist that knows the truth behind creating beautiful music even if its horrific and traumatic in nature, in fact the more extreme the music the more dificult the emotion to bare and bring out to music to paint his wonderful atmospere's of pain, so im personally thanking the man because to let out such raw music the man must have nerves of steel. being a long time metal head and only discovering hellHammer a short time ago he has reminded of what metal music was and why i like it in the first place and why people actually follow it like religion. excellent guitar work with its own unique and very difficult technique to master your emotion and bring it out for people to experience rather than playing 300 notes a second that mean nothing!!!!!! hats off to you tom gabriel you really are a warrior!
140123755X|2.0|This book is just boring. It's a neat idea with a really, really boring story line. The art is okay, but nothing special.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love it its just that you have to wait for a scratch ticket if your out of tokens and don't want to buy other then that its great
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love playing this game.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I haven't figured out how to just start a 2nd (or 3rd) game without totally exiting Spider and starting over from home page.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|My fiance kept telling me to read the books and I kept saying that I would. I fell in love with the show, but once I actually started reading the books I almost can't put them down. I can't wait to finish them all. They definitely keep you interested.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome! Can't wait for season 4!<br />The aliens in the show are really creative and the show has a great plot line!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A good sequel to the first book in the series. The writing is a bit sophomoric, but you can't help but be involved in the characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzle game. Not too hard but hard enough that you have to think about it. Very entertaining, I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to seeing more levels in the future.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Another very good story from Charlaine Harris. A great continuation to the story of our heros and heroines in Bon Temps.
B009HSVHV2|4.0|What can I say, it's KISS! Must have KISS music for a KISS fan. Has some really good songs that take me back to the old KISS sound.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think I read this entire book in two days. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the rest!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I am already acquainted with this outstanding news organization. This Bbc promoted app offered a quick way to access headlines and other newsworthy items.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Everyone should be able to enjoy the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A great, classic piece of literature for everyone.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Have made this my lifestyle.  Its very effective and I'm much healthier for it.  I recommend it to anyone who needs a healthier lifestyle.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great ending to a great series. No loose ends and so much promise for all of our favorite characters.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love, love love this show.  Great writing.  You learn to love the characters, even the ones you love to hate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A wonderful sequel to The Hunger Games. This is a great series for any reader. Looking forward to the final installment.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a great show and often keeps on edge all season.  The depiction of characters, class, and how their lives intersect and impact one anothers is well written.  Keep the show going!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I invited friends to have dinner and watch the movie with me.  The guests enjoyed the dinner but could not watch the movie.  My Roku library said I had it for 29 more hours but when I tried to retrieve it the movie was gone.  What I saw of the movie was not as good as the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I AM HOOKED on this book/series. Part of the reason I love the genre of Science Fiction is that it helps explore humanity in circumstances - that as far as we know, haven't happened yet. The philosophy and psyche of the human societal stages and drives are examined in this book/series. History shows that if we that do not learn from the mistakes of our past, we are doomed to be repeat them. Hugh Howey might allow us to forgo certain errors by entertaining the thought of them, \\"the what ifs'\\", with this deep dive into human behaviour systems. (FYI Female Hero within) If nothing else maybe we can write a better \\"Pact and Legacy\\"... Thanks for the world/s Micro and Macro Hugh Howey﻿.
B006BQNJR8|3.0|Ok this is a later update to the one Schwarzenegger did but he just doesn't have the flare and body mass of him. The acting was kind of flat too. I'm  not saying the movie was bad but it just wasn't as good as the old one. Is it worth watching yes but somehow it just never got me as excited as Arnold does, LOL.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Looks beautiful on the kindle fire hd screen. Very addicting,  but don't use all of your pearls in the beginning bc you need them later in the game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome it rocks and  to get updates just delete the game and reinstall it. PS it save your progress/worlds
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I like it.  I was looking for basic cost effective protection for my Kindle Fire and this does the job.
1449437524|5.0|I love this book. I originally saw the comic on The Oatmeal website. Had me cracking up and crying tears of laughter.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift for my mother, she loves it. Keeps it on her coffee table.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 sees all coming off the tails of war.  There are major revelations and events, upstairs and down. I look forward to season 4. This is my favorite series of all time.
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|What a waste of money.  Juvenile conception, and frankly, very boring.  I couldn't believe my eyes - cartoon format??  The book description was very misleading.  I can't imagine anyone reading this and enjoying it EVER.  0 star.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This is a clever series that quickly pulls you in. The characters, of course, are timeless, but the acting is great. So too is the mise-en-scene; you'll be glad that you picked it up. The individual episodes are very long, but the series itself is quite short. That's the biggest complaint I have about this series; once you get hooked, you won't be able to get your fix for long.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I ENJOY WATCHING THE ACTORS IN THIS FLICK,  I LIKED THE STORY LINE AND THE ACTION OF THE MOVIE. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE RED 2
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best book ever!!!!!  I read the last two in a week, I just couldn't stop reading them. great great book!!!!
B005LJK3AC|3.0|WIFE LIKED IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME. GAVE IT A THREE, SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WIFE AND I.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Love the action and the story I hope they make a 2nd one. The ending sets it up perfectly for a sequel.
B0090P0O70|5.0|I had to read this for a literature class and found it to be an easy read. Good version of the text
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|One of the best movies of the past 20 years.  Great action, amazing effects, and something to think about.  A winner!
B00ENC229S|5.0|This will be a review to clear up peoples questions. I will not go into the plots, twists, who stays and who leaves, or who lives and who dies. Essentially, before watching this series you should google Spartacus and get an idea on the story. That is all you need to know before seeing this series. I will also warn you that this is by far the most bloodiest series I have seen in years. But it is all in the context of what the Gladiator's are trained and purchased for. This is all needed. I will also warn you that if you are turned off by soft porn or strong sexual content? This comes as close or even more than anything you will see on late night on Showtime or Cinemax. And may not be for you. Now that being said, I have not seen a series that is anywhere near as great as this epic 4 season series.<br /><br />First, there are 4 seasons. The first season is called Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The actor who originally plays Spartacus is named Andy Whitfield and I am very sorry to say after this season he passed away from cancer. The link is [...] if you wish to see who he was. I do have to say it was a bit tough to take to his replacement later on as he was really loved. But it did not take long to fall in love with his character again even with a new actor by the name of Liam McIntyre who does an outstanding job playing Spartacus. After Blood and Sand was done they came up with a prequel called Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. This was 10 episodes long and it shows what events take place before Spartacus arrives and the circumstances in which he finds himself training to be a Gladiator. I will say this was not what he wanted, and the idea of Freedom is a theme that pounds away at you through the whole series due to his new surroundings. So in the Prequel Gods of the Arena, the Champion of the house is called Gannicus. For you ladies, I would suggest you google him....His real name is Dustin Clare and some feel he stole the show with his performance.<br /><br />I can tell you events in each film but it will really ruin it for you. So after this prequel &#34;Gods of the Arena&#34;, the next season is called Spartacus: Vengeance. Now this is where the original actor who played Spartacus was replaced. Again the actor who took this role is named Liam McIntyre and he does a brilliant job from start to the last episode and the conclusion of the series. The 4th and final season is called Spartacus: War of the Damned. Which is what I am suppose to be reviewing. In this last installment, they bring back many of the characters I have not mentioned that you will grow to love and root for which makes the last season War of the Damned brilliant and on your seat waiting for days to pass by so you can get to the next episode. In addition to the character Gannicus who plays in &#34;The Gods of the Arena&#34;, the prequel, there is another character I should have mentioned sooner. The character's name is Crixus played by Manu Bennett. He is just as important and amazing as anyone in a lead acting role and in all great series or films, The Hero Spartacus also has to have a counter part to argue and fight with. You will enjoy this character Crixus and the evolution of his character through out his time in the series. In the final season &#34;The War of The Damned&#34;, Spartacus faces his most intelligent and fierce opponent from the Roman Army, called Crassus played by Simon Merrells. Spartacus and Crassus att odds and destine to face each other, one fighting for glory of the Republic of Rome and the other Spartacus, the fight For freedom not just for Gladiator's, but for all woman, men, and humanity. The story just builds up until the last episode.<br /><br />You can google &#34;Starz Spartacus Series&#34; and read about the characters and the story lines if you wish. I gave everyone the names of each series as they aired in order to clear up the confusion. So in telling you what it is all about and giving details and maybe hurting your experience, I will just say that I personally loved this series and it is one of my favorites I have ever seen. If you liked Braveheart, and Gladiator? This is a little like those great films but way more violent, and a ton more sexual content. Not good for children, or even teenagers depending on your flexibility with what age you allow your children to watch Rated R, to soft porn? This is in my humble opinion just for adults only. So just a friendly warning. So everyone asking for the 4th series? You have them all named in here. Spartacus : War of the Damned being the last season. It has everything you could think of or want. Themes of love, hate, Slaves, Freedom with the highest cost, bonds of brotherhood, the complexity of the time period, family dynamics and bonds between fathers and sons, Sacrifice and finally betrayal. It has everything you want in this type of genre of film. There are so many characters I did not mention or we would be here all day. I hope if you love these types of movies you will give this a chance. You will be taken in from the very first episode. They waste no time in any episode moving this along. I loved it and I continue to watch it over and over. Start with the first season Spartacus: Blood and Sand. You will not stop watching I promise you. Worth every dime. Hope this helped and cleared things up for everyone who were confused on how many seasons and why. Enjoy......ill just say that I personally loved this series and it is one of my favorites I have ever seen. If you liked Braveheart, and Gladiator?

1608871452|5.0|My daughter had to wait extremely impatiently for me to get home today to get this book.  Mom's account, mom gets it first.  This book is sooo full of everything a Supernatural fan could want.  I already knew the little postcards didn't come out so I wasn't disappointed by that and even though I knew about the extras it was amazing to get to see them in person.  My daughter has already sat down to start reading and is about half way through.  She keeps exclaiming about every 3 pages excitedly about something new she discovered.  We're going to a Supernatural convention this month and I plan to lug this book with me to get as many autographs as I can.  It is a very heavy book so I may regret that decision at some point but it'll be an awesome conversation piece with the autographs as well.  Everyone made comment about how beautiful this book is without the cover.....I wasn't expecting much but the cover is, as my girls would say \\"amazballs\\"  A very nice addition to any collection
B00445YMME|5.0|I love this show and every season is wonderful. It makes you laugh, and you fall in love with all of the characters.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|UPDATED 5-17-14  I took one star off because I had great difficulty trying to change my lock screen wallpaper because my phone would not let me access my created folder for the file.  This app was no help there.  But I finally did copy and paste it into a designated system folder for wallpaper.  I'm looking for a better file manager.<br />Original Post:<br />I only got this to create shortcuts to videos and images on my home pages on my Samsung (Galaxy) Exhibit 2 4G SGH-T679  Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread.UVLE1.  It does this beautifully and is easy to navigate.
B009HNDSL4|5.0|The season and this show were amazing! It always puts me in a good mood while making me and my husband laugh!
B00AW57L96|4.0|You will never guess the secret! And then when it's revealed you can't guess how the situation will be resolved. The reflective ending made it all the more shocking! I haven't read a book in years that has kept me so interested from start to finish
B005OP28XS|5.0|I love this show and every season is wonderful. It makes you laugh, and you fall in love with all of the characters.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorite Disney movies and am glad I was finally able<br />to get it on Blu Ray with all the bonus features.
B00BLOKNVK|1.0|Totally Scratched!!!!  Unplayable, looked like some one used it as a coaster for a year.  Lucky for me, I have a polishing kit. And was able to fix it.  Other than that the movie was great.
193700788X|1.0|This book was a complete and utter disappointment.  I loved reading the series, in fact, I read all 10 books in a month.  I wish I wouldn't have finished this book, so I could have made up my own ending.  I agree with other reviewers, the author pretty much destroyed the characters she spent so long developing.  It's truly a pity.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|He traveled in times I lived through.  His exposure to President Truman was fun and interesting since my family and the Truman family lived side by side for many years.  He was like Harry in many ways.  Everybody thought he was dumb when all he did was apply common sense.  Where are people like that today?
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Absolutely great series with great writing! All the characters are excellent and the actors really fill the roles.  I love Dr Phlox
B000002AGN|5.0|Huge fan of any thing Mid-Century Modern!!  Great music for a cocktail party and transports me back to a different time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book  suspenseful  well written  loved it...  using it in our book club  what more can i say  good bye
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is super fast paced with quick wit so if you're looking for a stoner comedy just move along. Otherwise pop into Downton and enjoy.<br /><br />Seriously, Maggie Smith almost made me pee myself laughing in the last episode I watched!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Great show! If you love music this is a must see. Enjoyable characters mixed with an engaging plot get my vote everyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I liked these books better than the Fifty Shades of Gray books, I can not wait for the next one.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I downloaded it but didn't use it. The next time I fully shut down my device, I received a message in the middle of the screen telling me how good it would be for me to read The Bible for 5 minutes a day (which is true...I just didn't ask for the notification).  So I finally opened the app to figure out how to turn off the notification, and got frustrated when I couldn't find it quickly.  It's probably a great app, but I'm afraid it turned me off.  I've got a great Kindle edition of The Bible, anyway.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like these books better than I did the Fifty Shades of Gray books, I can not wait for then next one!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Best free weather application I found. Takes a little while to load but getting more forecast then I do on my local weather application I downloaded. I would highly recommend this app .
B00846REIS|5.0|I like these books better than I did the Fifty Shades of Gray books.  Can't wait for the next one!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was for my son whose origianl cable just about broke from misuse.  This one seems sturdier, somehow.  Just get it!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Very interesting . very sad . man's inhumanity to man.  if one is interested in wartime stories, this is a good read.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Wanted to see it at the movies. Didn't get the chance. It was probably great on the big screen but seeing it in my own home was even better. Made me cry. Hugh Jackman sings wonderfully. Russel Crowe was okay, was a good actor, but not as good a singer. Still it's wonderfully done.
0385523912|5.0|I bought this for my husband, who is a historian, and he loved it! He actually gave it to one of his instructors as a gift!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having a place to save ideas and recipes online. I come. across things all the time I would. like to try one day or buy. pinterest keeps it all in one place. Love it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It really is a great app for an alarm clock. It has a lot of different options and I would like to see some new sounds and/or music to . Listen to.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2yr old loves these puzzles. After completing one of the puzzles, balloons float across the screen to be popped, that's his favorite part.
B00846REIS|5.0|So good, more realistic than 50 shades!!! Cant wait to read the next one. & the one after that :)
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The movie was always worth watching again and again. Batman and other characters seemed to be truly reborn in this new movies of batman. Always a good movie to watch.
B004TSXUWY|2.0|I am sorry to say that this book has gotten good critics and I was excited to reed it, but was very disappointed, of course amnesia is a terrible thing, but this book was far to long and a rubbish fiction about meaningless infidelity etc:(
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This is also something that should be included with the purchase of a kindle fire. The longer cord is great.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Loved this book - very well researched; I learnt a lot about the situation surrounding JFK in Dallas & about that period in USA.<br />The time travel aspect was so well thought out with consequences that I would never have thought of.<br /> Great charactors that you begin to really care about!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This wasn't as described. Why download a game and then have to spend more money to advance on the levels just to play it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is a really cool game that I play when I need to get my mind off something this game is great and fun.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game. It's very addicting, if you like card games with a twist. So many levels to play.
B00DWZHTRW|3.0|Good special effects and your favorite actors barely hold this one together. What ever happened to establishing a coherent story line. Don't pay full price or better yet wait for it on FX channel or something.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its really fun to play when you have nothing to do especially for me since I have some spare time in high school.
0812973992|1.0|Let the Great World Spin: I wanted to read it but the type was too light, and I had to give it away, unread.  Too bad.I Obviously, I did NOT hate it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really sad story but very well written and an amazing story :) it really touches the heart and you may cry but still a good book.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As someone who is ordained and preaches incorporating and contrasting the times of Jesus to our own, I found this a wonderful resource. The value and meaning of words and social values themselves, change over time. Reading the Bible from our own perspective and understanding of the world may cause us to miss important messages understood by his original audience. Aslan's grasp and understanding of the period through a critical study of all the primary sources added much to my knowledge of the social world of Jesus' time, and offers a richer, deeper way to engage the scriptures.<br />I think this is an excellent book for anyone who wants to better understand Jesus as a person, and the world he confronted at the cost of his life.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Who would have thought that a book. based predominantly on neuroses would be so much fun to read?  Glad Graeme Simsion did!  It's quirky and very different.
0316201561|5.0|Loved the characters and the story telling. Best thing was the writing, it was smart and deep while still catering to my 7 year olds imagination and love of fairy tales. It was interesting to see the stories we knew from another angle!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|When I saw Andrea Bocelli's concert  in Portofino on Channel 13, I know that I had to purchase the CD from that concert. I have almost all of Bocelli's CD's from Romanza to Passione. I listen to Bocelli sing and I am transported to another world.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|This is one that I just fell in love with the first time I saw it and I love the concept !!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Greate app I love it !!!! It is a great game play keep up the updates please bring regular tanks for battle please.
0345803507|1.0|Hate it. Hate it. Yep. Hate it. I cannot believe this will be turned into a movie but then again - they've tapped the well dry on new ideas, if they can get a hot woman and hot man to be hot and bothered and half-naked they'll run with it. Kudos EL James for suckering us into making you rich.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have no idea if you believe me but my high score is over four million! I'm addicted! Get this game!
B005O242D0|4.0|After a discussion with a friend about what we learn in our educational systems versus what the truth really is sometimes, I chose to read this for the first time - I came away with mixed emotions and thoughts but it was beneficial to read and open my mind instead of allowing myself to make up my own mind with all facts presented.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful series,compelling and interesting every week!  The characters are people you always want to know more about.
0345803485|1.0|I expected this to be amazing when it hit the lists so fast and people began to want to burn it and take it form the shelves for how 'wrong' it was. Curiosity piqued I read it and it was droll, inaccurate, and redundant.<br /><br />Anastasia comes off as a bipolar, unstable woman fluctuating between a weak little kitten who couldn't possibly defend herself nor stand on her own two feet into a raging wild woman of epic strength and courage, back into a simpering woman-child who needs protecting as the universe around her is explained and fed to her in bite-sized pieces. Christian is a dominant who easily gets &#34;topped&#34; by Anastasia and he himself comes off as a &#34;switch&#34; but none of this is ever addressed in the book. It's washed over and I'd imagine that's because this isn't something the author has experience with.<br /><br />Between the above mentioned and the over used &#34;ghost of a smile&#34;, chewed lip, scene after scene of raging Anastasia with a drink to throw (amongst over done/used scenes and phrases); it reads like a 10th grade girl who, after stumbling upon something naughty in her parent's private box, let her imagination run wild into being saved by a knight in shining armour who was a new breed of Billy Bad-boy.
0307271609|5.0|This is a very interesting book about Chinese history in the 19th and early 20th centuries, from the point of view of the central government -- specifically the Qing court.<br /><br />At first look, this book appears to be a biography of one person, but in fact it gives great insight into China during an important (and I'd say misunderstood time) as it emerged from its isolation in the 19th century.<br /><br />I must admit I didn't know much about the Empress Dowager Cixi before reading this book.  When I was in Beijing several years ago, I had heard about her taking money earmarked for modernizing the navy and diverting it to build a stone pavilion shaped like a boat at the Summer Palace.  My impression was that she was very backward, ignorant of the west, and controlling.  On the contrary, the author, Jung Chang, is very sympathetic towards Cixi and he often showed me how my original impression of her was wrong, and she was much more than the caricature I had in my mind.  She cared for China -- her motto was \\"China Strong\\".  She was curious about the West and was impressed by the West's technology, their political systems, and how the West treated it's own citizens, and she adopted (or tried to adopt) many facets of the West.  Many times, she was hampered by conservatives who didn't want to change.<br /><br />This is also a book about a smart woman who became leader of 1/3 of the world's population -- not by birth, but by her own will -- when she was in her 20s and remained a strong force in a country for most of the rest of her life.  It's telling that historians are not clear of what her original name was -- Cixi is an honorific name -- women's names weren't important enough to record, even when they were the emperor's mother.<br /><br />The book got a little tiresome to me somewhere in the second half, but keep with it and be sure to read the epilogue.  This one chapter outlines Cixi's lasting impacts and ties together the rest of the book with modern day China.<br /><br />By the way, about that stone boat story -- Cixi did pay for some of the renovation of the Summer Palace with funds that were earmarked for the navy, but Chang quickly points out that she paid for much of it out of her household budget and that it didn't have an effect on the strength of the navy. She was much more frugal in many other ways than that extravagance would imply.<br /><br />If you would like to know how China got to where it is today, this book is one you should read along the way.  After reading it, I feel that Cixi has gotten a bad rap and this book might reverse some of that..<br /><br />By the way, about that stone boat story -- Cixi did pay for some of the renovation of the Summer Palace with funds that were earmarked for the navy, but Chang quickly points out that she paid for much of it out of her household budget and that it didn't have an effect on the strength of the navy.

0345803493|1.0|.... so  sadly true! I'm compulsive and cannot finish a series even if I hate the writing; thusly I continued, much to  my chagrin. I regret not being able to get my time and money back.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome and good you have to buy it it is not a waste of money and the sound quality etc works awesome
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|gives you a front row seat. really liked the tricks. the story line is simple but it fits in with the cirque du soleil
1400069742|4.0|Olsen captures the personalities of the players during the period before WWII. What I found frightening was the power of the press and an elite circle of (primarily men) people who influenced the Nation's opinion to enter a war. What was informative? The parallel between then and now. I highly suggest this book for a perspective of the power of mass communication and politics, but beware . . . it's depressing, well written, and scary.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a very functional and useful APP. I don't have a clock on my side of the bed, so if I woke up in the middle of the night, then I would have to try and stretch over my husband to see his clock with out waking him. I love the variety of clocks to choose from. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because if I leave it open to use as a desktop clock, it drain my battery,even with it plugged in, it will die during the night on my Kindle fire.

B007AL48UK|5.0|Downloaded the game to have something to do on my compute to work. Love the graphics, can see without my glasses. :-) I also like that if there are no more moves you can reset the game tiles without starting the game over. Only thing that would make better if you can undo a few moves after no moves to redo some of your choices.
1451627297|5.0|This is an impressive novel, by any measure, but it may not quite be what some readers expect it to be.  With the flashy double covers focusing upon the assassination/prevention of the assassination of President Kennedy, some might think that its principal foci are those issues.  Not so.  This is a time-travel novel involving the Kennedy assassination, but its principal focus is the experience of the time traveler and the results of his actions--first and foremost for his own life and, then, for the course of history.<br /><br />We do not actually encounter Lee Harvey Oswald until p. 443 of the novel's 842 pp.  As the protagonist, Jake Epping, travels back in time he has other cases on his mind, not just the Kennedy assassination.  Fortunately, his life is a fascinating one and Stephen King tells it within a relatively straightforward narrative, `straightforward' considering the difficulties presented by the material.  This is Jake's story, not Jack's or Lee's and that must be its constant focus.<br /><br />King faces three major challenges in telling the story.  First, he must sort through the time travel business and all of its implications and potential results.  This is far more complex than one might initially perceive and King must navigate the issue without plunging the book into some vastly convoluted reflection on time travel itself.<br /><br />Second, King must confront the details of Oswald's life, the attempt on the life of General Walker, the precise political ethos of 1963 Dallas, the Oswalds' position within the Russian community in Dallas, and so on, knowing that a number of his readers will be sophisticated, at times obsessive students of this material.  Mistakes and foulups will not be easily forgiven.<br /><br />Finally, he must conjure with the differences between life in 1963 and life in 2010 and that, of course, is far more complex than the absence of cellphones and sophisticated surgical techniques.  Think: over-the-counter medications, differences in currency, contemporary prices, the details of contemporary automobiles, bugging devices, clothing manufacturers, television programming, contemporary cinema and popular music, extant newspapers, manufacturing techniques, and so on.<br /><br />In the latter, King excels (though he does very well with the other challenges).  The principal differences to the time traveler lie in the texture of life and the manner in which that has altered.<br /><br />This is also (without giving away too much) a love story and for the protagonist the love story is at the center of the experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book, but a quarter of a million words or so means that the reader is making a significant commitment.  Fortunately, the novel reads quickly, considering its size.  It is not, however, a book that is principally concerned with the Kennedy assassination.  For that, read Don DeLillo's Libra and James Ellroy's American Tabloid (and check out the more recent takes by Max Allan Collins and Stephen Hunter).  This is a novel about a high school English teacher from Maine who is urged to become a time traveler and learns, in detail, the consequences of his decision to do so.  It is a very personal story with a large, public dimension which is, ultimately, secondary.  The personal story is well worth the journey.ences in currency, contemporary prices, the details of contemporary automobiles, bugging devices, clothing manufacturers, television programming, contemporary cinema and popular music, extant newspapers, manufacturing techniques, and so on.<br /><br />In the latter, King excels (though he does very well with the other challenges).

B0091REZMW|3.0|It's alright. Not the best not the worst game either though. Something to play when bored on an afternoon. I hate that it's a social media game.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This was a great movie by a great guy and musician. May Sound City live on in memory as one of the greats
0451205766|5.0|I pulled this book from the bookshelf the other day and treated myself to a great reread.<br />Puzo hits all the right notes in this masterpiece. The book has everything you could possibly need, drama, action, love, hate. Recommended.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very well written with lots of little twists and turns. I would definitely recommend this one. I am even reading one of her older books, What Alice Forgot. Love it too!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|This was ordered for my Disable child, it helps her, to play with the plain and understand what happens in a airport.  I do recommend this to your children.  thank you  Mrs. Lopez
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|She not only has it all together .... She shows you how to do it.  Very uplifting and instructional book... Loved every minute of the read...inspirational and great writer....
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|This movie touches my heart.  It shows the love of God.  It is truth, honest, funny, and at times, brings a tear to your eye. I love it !!
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I have contacted customer service for both Amazon and YouVersion and neither one can fuigure out why it will not work in the Device w/o internet mode.  The device is the Kindle Fire.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I can't wait to complete this app, and go unto the next two. This game is very challenging. My friend plays alot of games so when I showed her this, she immediating purchased it, and loved it, even her boyfriend became hooked, when I asked how he liked it, he replied, &#34;one game took me nearly a half hour to figure out and I almost threw the thing out the window.&#34; Not only does this game teach strategy but you have to have alot of patience. This is well worth both. Kisses.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've already watched the movie so I was unsure whether the book would keep my interest. I'm so glad I did. There is so much more detail and it actually makes the movie better! I'm definitely going to read the rest of the series then watch the movie again!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini never ceases to amaze me with his literary style and his stories. I've never been disappointed with his work.
B0058SNKRY|3.0|They are a little small & I wish they had half sizes. Look very cute though & they are light weight.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I wish I stopped reading the series at Dead in the Family.  I'm trying not to let the last few books ruin the series for me but it kind of did.  Initially, in the first few books, I did see her hints about Sookie ending up w/Sam.  However as the story progressed it no longer fit and there weren't any hints.  I feel she built up this relationship with Eric for the majority of the books and I fell in love w/that relationship.  It seems like after they announced 3 remaining books that Harris realized the story wasn't what she pictured at the beginning and then proceeded to force it back to what she initially picture.  It didn't work!  The relationship with Sam did not feel real especially so soon after ending things with Eric.<br /><br />Harris knew how readers felt.  How could she not with all the comments and reviews from the books? But she did not care.  You can even read her blog about the last book \\"...In the end, my sales went up. I would rather not have had to endure what I did, but did the controversy really hurt the book? No, it didn't...\\"<br /><br />\\"[...]<br /><br />Well I can tell she didn't care.  I was a huge fan but I don't think I want to go through this again.  I'll never invest in another book from Harris, I hope I'm not the only one who boycotts her books and I hope she feels the hit in her sales.
B008PZZFHA|5.0|Hilarious movie I have ever seen it made me laugh for twenty mins after the movie true comedy. Totally Hilarious
B003TTCURU|5.0|I have loved Grey's Anatomy since the very first episode! I hate to see it go but it's been a great run:)
B00AYB0YFQ|4.0|It was a pretty good movie but there where a couple of times where it was not as funny sometimes
B001P36OY2|5.0|Not much to say here.  It's Vin Diesel for crying out loud.  He is absolutely beautiful and his voice is amazing.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I would pay $1 for this game. The graphics are awesome and the challenges are cool. Some stages are pretty tricky. Great job!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|GAGA is and always will be number1... so creative... we are lucky to of lived amongst her... Her world domination is just a few months away!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|IF this device was from some little company I never heard of I would only give it 1 or 2 stars.  But since it is from Google and thus I believe they will support this and other vendors will make code available it should work pretty good in the future.  Right now it is problematic.<br /><br />It only cost $35 & I was one of the lucky ones that bought it when the promotion for 3 free months of Netflix (new and existing customers) was available.  Thus it only really cost me $11<br /><br />Right now it supposedly supports Netflix and YouTube with Google Chrome (in beta).  I have it plugged into my smart Vizio 47&#34; TV that also has these apps built in.  My TV apps work much better than the Chromecast does.  Chromecast has several pauses and hangs using Netflix.<br /><br />One thing that I was disappoint with on Chromecast it that it only supports 2.4 and not 5.0 GHz.  It kind of works now, but will do so a lot better in the near future.  Worth the money, but you have to be patient.
0807130087|5.0|I first read this book years ago.....a friend suggested I reread it, and it's still holds up to my memories.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|We have enjoyed watching McGyver!!!  Action packed and fun to watch!!  We would recommend this to everyone - young and old.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie - loved how the music was incorp. Fav HS book - well done! I would rec to anyone
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am usually a hearts and flowers and happy endings reader..but this book was recommended to me and I gave it a chance.  I am glad i did. Excellent read!
B000002AH1|5.0|Great album,<br /><br />I never was a fan of John McLaughlin until I heard this record... even if you don't like Miles' other work you will like this piece of art; it's about as raw as you get in music, unlike anything I have ever heard.
B000001DV2|5.0|I have been woven into the Def Leppard fabric long enough now to find a quality of my appreciation that starts to approach the quality of their work.
B00004STPT|3.0|If you want to sit back and enjoy some very good sounding songs, this is hard to beat. Each track has a nice different flavor to it.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|It's Sir Paul doing what he does best!  Nice mix of Beatles songs & some of Paul's hits. For those of us that cannot afford to<br />see him live, this does the job for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I could not stop watching this program I would recommend it to anybody. Start watching it now before season four starts
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenges the mind and is very addicting.  Definitely a fan of this game. My 7 year old enjoys this game also.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Mother fudge ripple this book eviscerated me. I thought it was a little heavy handed on the whole best friend parents (one part reminded me of that scene in Mean Girls where the mom offers her daughter snacks or condoms when she was making out with her boyfriend) I LOVED those parents, and every other character. It was so beautifully and hauntingly written but dang it made me cry. I'm not an outward book cryer. I might cry on the inside but usually reserve tears for real life. This book and a few others were an exception. So don't read this if you're already sad ok?
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love Downton Abby. This has the same feel. Totally different type of characters. Equally awesome. Looking forward to more great episodes of this show.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is super addicting!!!!!!!  The only drawback was I used some amazon coins I had to purchase coins for the in-game play and never received them.  I keep getting an error message but they took the coins from my amazon account.  Thank the lord I didn't use actual money!!!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Loved it, I couldn't put the book down.  I liked the research he put into the book.  I wanted to know more about the free masons after reading the book.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|You have to watch it. I couldn't stop watching this movie for 2 days. The first time I found it sad, the second time I laughed. I'm about to watch it again right now.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|This movie was a gift for someone else.....a collector of all things 'marvel superhero', and needless to say; this movie was well received..
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it twice to see if I could pick up on the surprise ending but it really was not evident. Would watch it again even knowing what will happen for the fun of it.  I would recommend it if you like twists and turns and bad guys getting their dues. It was interesting seeing the illusions behind the magic revealed. If you already don't know how the illusions are done then this is an interesting aspect. I like the fact that one of the magicians was a woman; its nice to see that primary role in a field where women are usually assistants. From a non-magician point of view and just being able to enjoy the show; all in all it was a fun movie.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone else, and after seeing it, I had to go out and buy my own.....
B008JFLWLE|3.0|it dosen't work like I thought but it works,it's more for complex math calcs  the hand gestures in your hand writing will make all the difference
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Prometheus is the current end of the long series of Alien vs. Predator Movies. It ties up some loose ends and then makes entirely new ones........
0811876373|5.0|My grandaughter love this book when she saw in the store.  I found here in amazon at a great price.  When she received  it, she was very happy when she saw all the different kind of pops she can make it.
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|i'm an avid collector of the Monster High Dolls and when i saw the price drop on 13 Wishes Lagoona, i jumped. she arrived yesterday and she is gorgeous! so fun with her hairstyle and darker colouring. i love her collectible pet in the bowl. a wonderful addition to any collection!
B003NB8KE6|5.0|I had mixed thoughts when I ordered them wondering if compression gear really works... It does! Its either that or my body instantly got much better at recovering from crushing workouts. As someone training for an ironman the ability to heal my destroyed legs after all day bike rides is fantastic.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|i have loved this show from the moment i laid eyes on it's promo ads ages ago. if you love violence, drama, sex, and pretty much everything in between, this is the show for you!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is an Awesome show!!!! Harvey Spector makes this show. He's so dreamy. Each episode leaves me waiting on the next!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This was very inexpensive, but provides a lot of options.  Have showed my 2 yr. and 3 yr. old granddaughters how to use it and my 3 yr. old was able to move around in the program very well.  My 2 yr. old  liked coloring with the various &#34;tools&#34;.  The pictures that are available to add to a drawing are extensive.  Great product for the money - I'm so glad I found it.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it as much this time. I'm not a mythology fan per se, but found this subject enjoyable in the context of the book. Like many good works if fiction, it leaves me wondering if it could be true, even though I know it's not, is it?
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read Gone Girl first...and wanted more.  Read Dark Places which was better than Gone Girl.  Sharp Objects was her first book but my last read...and I think it was the best!  If you read Jodi P, you will love Gillian F.  I am waiting for her next novel!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book ended faster than I thought or maybe I just read too fast. This book was great. I laughed, I cried, and feel a better sense of being so young with not a lot of time left. The banter in here doesn't seem consistent with their age. Who at 16 can honestly be so eloquent? But I enjoyed the relationship that quickly developed between the two characters. I highly recommend it and would most likely see the movie when it comes out, although I'm sure it wouldn't live up to the book.
B005544V6A|5.0|Intelligent, well written drama that keeps you guessing!  Highly recommend if you like shows that make you think and develop solid characters.
B001F6ZIXW|3.0|Criminal biker gangs, like gangsters of old, have a certain fascination connected to a &#34;what if I could do whatever the f*** I wanted&#34; fantasy.  The reality is more likely to be thuggish and psychotically amoral. I have only watched one episode but I have a feeling that depsite the &#34;biker with a heart of gold&#34; character it will wear thin.
0316743003|5.0|Even if you are not into planes, I encourage people to read this book. It is half history (AWESOME HISTORY!), and a half business book. I learned a lot about business and management from this book. Also cool to hear about technology that was so secret only a few people in the White House knew it even existed. There are some great stories that came out of it. It is my favorite book I have ever read, and I learned a great amount from.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I've grown to love this series.  It's new and interesting so far.  The concept hasen't been done and I really like the main actress.  She's amazing in my opinion.  We need more quality series with good female leads.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|World of Goo is a great game. Unique in its game play, challenging with multiple levels and worlds (seasons). Levels vary enough to keep the action from seeming repetitive. The Sign Painter attempts to \\" helps\\" you along your journey with convoluted stories and mysterious clues. Overall its a great mix between puzzle and action!
0316019984|4.0|Pop-up books are always fun, and this one is exciting because it has all the popular comic book characters in it.
B00B5AAW52|3.0|Love Gilmore Girls! I lost my first set to Hurricane Irene and was excited to replace it.  However, I was disappointed that this picture let me to believe that this was the same&#34;suitcase&#34; set I had previously, but in was a smaller box with nor fun episode guide:(
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I cried at the end..I was hysterical. This book is absolutely flawless!!I'd highly recommend this book to everyone out there!!
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|Always a good read is LM Alcott.  Predictable, always, but fun nonetheless.  You will enjoy these books as a look back into history and life as she knew it.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Cant go wrong with Jamie Foxx or Gerald Butler. Both are great actors and this film really shows the dark side of Butler.
B00620OANU|5.0|Love this show. Last few episodes are nail biting! One of my favorite seasons, who am I kidding, I love them all!
B00164GDA0|4.0|Great movie i use to watch on vhs all the time growing up. So i bought it after it was converted to blu ray.
B0095P31L6|4.0|I enjoyed putting the voices with each character.  The graphics were great as well as the story line.  Download was a breeze.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Best ever! I love all these songs! I love this group!!! This cd is good for any occasion and has something for everyone.
1594484805|1.0|Not recommended
B001I45UFC|5.0|I love this book. The movie is GREAT. Oh how I wish the Pevensie children were in all the books
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's fast and I love that I can play with other real people. Nice clean graphics too. Will be checking out other games by this maker.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|As all the other 5 star reviews say, this is a great album. You know you're a true fan when you can know that each album from your favorite artist is going to be different but even more amazing than the next and that's what Trent has done with his new album. Hesitation Marks is unique because Trent adds his always present NIN aspect while incorporating aspects of HTDA into the mix. I can't wait to see some of these tracks live when I head to Vegas later this year to catch one of his shows. For all those die hard NIN fans out there, I really hope you all give this album a chance as it's well worth the listen.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is one of the greatest. got to get this awesome game. very cool and get to play with friends
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a very fun and  addicting game. Helps pass the time. Only thing I dislike is I cannot find elk macho and have been playing for some time now, other than that great game
B00884GR0W|4.0|I had 42 ruby in my inventory but when my hand slipped and it went outside the box it disipeared and i could not find it if u can fix it please do.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Awesome  very prophetic If you watch movie with you spiritual eyes and your natural eyes you will see how God is show us how to really our lives
B00B97TMIE|5.0|It's been too long since I've enjoyed an entire album from start to finish. Every song is worth hearing and I do so often.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the manner n which the plots became entangled.. Hard to put down. Fine writing and  so unusual. Kudos to the author!
B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|Great film that I feel is underrated and not known well enough! I really enjoyed how realistic it was following these boys and their struggles. Worth the watch.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|love the overall look  and feel.of this app.  the functionality is very intuitive and designed with iser simplicity in mond<br /> lord knows you need simple at 4am or you get smashed tablet
B000NY12LO|5.0|Love this author and the story line tugged at my heart! If you love Picoult's books than this is a must read!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I downloaded this application because this was recommended to make some of my facebook games work.  the application installed but i have no idea how to use it and it seems to be making no difference in the way my games operate.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love getting local weather and time and forecast right in one easy to see place.  Looks great and works great!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|The only reason I downloaded this is that I could not find my battery status by looking at the screen on my Kindle Fire.  Once I figured out where the little indicator was, this app is convenient but not actually necessary.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|This was a fun mystery.  It is set in<br />Savannah with a bunch of fun<br />characters.  Everyone wants<br />to kill everyone else.  Don't<br />miss this one.
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|I use this keypad with a Logitech wireless KB that does not have a keypad. I like the look and feel of it. Having a calculator mode that can send the result to the computer is handy. Matches well with the Mac look of the touch pad, too.
B005LAIIMG|2.0|WWZ is dull and cliched with some serious leaps in logic.  Yes I know it's a zombie movie and illogical by nature, but the characters end up making stupid decisions because that's what the director/screenwriter/studio/Brad Pitt needed them to do. You get a sense that there could be more interesting characters to follow but we get stuck with Brad Pitt's character who doesn't even have any real qualifications to be some kind of UN rep/problem solver.<br /><br />It gets two stars for effort and the idea of North Koreans removing the teeth of all its population pre-emptively.
160774273X|1.0|Not what I expected for an easy bread making experience.  I did not want to buy pans, etc. just for the challenge of making my own artisan bread.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A thousand splendid suns was better but this is good  he is a great story teller and writes vividly and understandably
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I wanted to watch a series that I could relax and enjoy that wasn't just fluff. The Good Wife has just enough backstory to keep you coming back but doesn't drag on and on. Very enjoyable.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|From the beginning of the movie until the last second, this movie grabs you and says, &#34;Hey, are you ready for an adventure?!?!&#34;  Seriously, this is a great one! JJ Abrams at his best! The casting, the score, the cinematography, the action scenes, the wardrobe, everything about this film was amazing!! The Enterprise as The Enterprise, Chris Pine as Captain James T Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty, John Cho as Sulu, Freaking Eric Bana, they couldn't have picked a better cast!!!!! I could go on and on!  Great story too, I like how they gave a new generation(us) an origin story with the old characters that most of us probably watched reruns of as kids.  The crew of the USS Enterprise boldly going where no man has gone before!  I don't want to spoil anything.  Just watch it already!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This film is wonderfully gritty, dark, and brutal, without ever becoming what I would consider gratuitous.  Unlike the Stallone vehicle, &#34;Judge Dredd,&#34; &#34;Dredd&#34; represents a far better imagining of the world from the original comics.  Karl Urban is a fantastic Dredd, and if you think you'll be disappointed by the introduction of Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), don't be.  Her character never becomes cloying or burdensome, and she kicks a fair amount of a** in her own right.<br /><br />If you're a fan of dystopian sci-fi, a fan of the comic series, or a fan of any of the lead actors, I highly recommend &#34;Dredd.&#34;
B001NLL93W|5.0|I look forward to the next novel, I've enjoyed the books so far. I am also glad an uncomfortable relationship has been resolved!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have watched all 10 seasons and really enjoyed it.  Looking forward to more.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|This show reminds me of the bond between true girlfriends. The friends you can be totally honest with. They know your secrets that are in the closet.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I too bought this RAM to upgrade my memory in the Synology 1813+ NAS storage device. Compared to the options out there at time this was the cheapest way to upgrade, other memory options being a lot more expensive.<br /><br />No problems so far, I will update this review if the situation changes.
1781162646|5.0|King's foray into this genre is not only successful, but I'd love to see him to more in this line. His characters are well fleshed out, as always, but the story line is just a bit different from what he usually does, and he makes it work really well! Also, it is not too wordy with description as some of his novels are, and though I love his longer and very descriptive stories, this genre is not really conducive to that, so he is spot on. I loved this story and will read it more than a couple of times.
B000001EL3|5.0|This cd was Kiss in their finest hour.Now remastered, it sounds better than ever.Price was right,but being their best cd you would have thought they would have done more on the extras...support your favorire artists.
B00340LM8C|5.0|This movie has always has been one of my all time favorites and glad to see that Amazon has it available.
B00A9C3RNQ|2.0|I was looking for good chemistry between these two stellar veterans and couldn't find it.  I hoped for some comedy from Tommy Lee and I sure didn't read any reviews prior to watching the movie because his character had no funny bone whatsoever.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is a great scifi adventure with an underlying family story about a father and his three sons.  Great show, great cast, well worth a watch!
030796664X|5.0|My husband and I both listened to this book.  We both had the same reaction - it is a very interesting listen.  And it was great to listen to it instead of read it since we both have long commutes to work every day.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I wish I would have waited for this movie to be offered for free because it was not thrilling enough or interesting enough to shell out money for.  Their were no surprises in this movie to make me love it.
B00A83075M|4.0|My 4 year old wanted this move so we got it and as we all watched it I realized it was a bit too old for him.  And after we wathced it there was lots of punhcing the air and punching his bed, etc.  So its on hold till he gets a lottle bit bigger!!
B002ZM74Y6|2.0|After Boardwalk Empire, I don't know who could sit through this movie.  I am not a Kevin Costner fan because I feel he cannot act very well and this movie showed me once again why I strongly do not like Costner as an actor.  Also, the movie was not realistic at all.  I was very bored and could not finish watching it.  IDK, maybe it got better after the first 45 minute.
0763644765|5.0|We read this every night before my son went to bed and I think it really helped him get the message about going potty in the toilet and not his diaper.  All trained up now!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed the first two seasons and loved the third even though it was sad in places.  Think the characters are so well played and the costuming is wonderful.
B000FC1KBG|5.0|I am a baby-wise mom, and found this book to be a great compliment to it as it really helped fill in the gaps of baby-wise.  The part about how to read your baby's cries and body language was revolutionary to me as a mom.  I wish I had read this with my first daughter.  Now with my 2nd baby I am able to respond to her needs so much more quickly.  Where baby-wise helps you establish a good routine, Tracy Hogg helps with everything inbetween.  I also would encourage every new mom to read the Y chapter - if possible before the baby even comes.  Nothing prepares you for the emotional roller coaster ride you will be on after you give birth - particularly if it is a difficult birth.  Tracy talks about how to cope with all those emotions and take care of yourself after giving birth.  I think the Y chapter - though toward the end of the book, should be read first by every new mom.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Awesome movie for Tom Cruise.  If you're a fan of Sci-Fi and Tom Cruise, you'll love this movie.  The plot is super suspenseful, with a bunch of twists and mystery mixed in.  The CGI is really well done, definitely a well budgeted movie.  This is an awesome movie and you'll love it.  Just make sure to get it on Blu-Ray to enjoy the graphics and CGI.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not nearly as good as some. Better luck next time, John. Nine more words are required. Four more. The end.

B00EDF43MY|5.0|This new Dr. Panda game is very helpful and explains what to expect when you visit an airport....It is geared for your younger ones and should keep them busy while they learn and have fun...My 3 year old grandson loves these games and always asks for Dr. Panda ...They are all excellent apps and I highly recommend that you give them a try!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Pretty interesting game. I wish though the pictures won't so little. I love how the items move aces once you leave the picture
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is an eye-opener and a life-saver. Eating modern, hybridized wheat is as dangerous as eating a candy bar! Yes, Dr. William Davis, cardiologist, has researched and studied the subject thoroughly. He posits the idea that modern wheat helps to set up insulin resistance. Insulin resistance enables us to deposit plaque in our arteries. Diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart disease, and other diseases ensue. Approximately one third of our fellow Americans are obese, and many suffer from the effects of insulin resistance. The outward signs are a big belly or love handles: These are the signs of visceral fat. It surrounds our organs, is metabolically active, and it is a sign of disease processes underway. We've been instructed to &#34;eat whole grains&#34; - NOT!  Read Dr. Davis's book and become lean and healthy for life.  - Blossom Stringfellow
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My God. If this book didn't make you cry, you are a soulless being. This book is indescribable. Basically, this book is a necessary read for any man, woman, teenager etc. This beautiful book gives a whole new meaning to \\"life\\" and it makes me grateful for everything, from the breath my lungs take, to the dark behind my eyelids when I blink. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE. You will always love it.<br />  Okay? :')
B007Q0CKAU|5.0|This book was captivating.<br />It was beautifully different, the subject was so relevant and had such a significant message to people about beauty.

B00B6U63ZE|5.0|As an HR Leader, I really recomend this reading for all who are changing or taking new responsabilities. Really helpfull
B00340ESIS|5.0|Great read and very smart. I'm starting to write screenplays and I'm going to create my own cheat-sheet of the steps he's created in this book. I would say it's a great starting point to figure out how to write something with good structure. Once you read and apply this, you can start to learn how to make even better screenplays by manipulating what he's set in place.<br /><br />Structure, structure structure!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I find that I must reach three stars at every level or I have to keep replaying the level.  I like that I can&middot;T reach it first time every.  I would not be satisfied with the challenge.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Love the plot of this movie.  Keep you guessing throughout.  This movie is well worth wtching and will keep you guessing until its final conclusion.
1472200322|2.0|One good thing: reading comforted the boy, as it did me through my lonely childhood & adolescence.<br />I cannot believe that our book group chose this book! I would never, otherwise, have read it -  filled with my notes of \\"OMG\\" about this terrible book. Want to read a much better written & challenging  book on good & evil? Try Murakami's 1Q84.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I was hoping for a good action flick and Dredd delivered. No complaints, especially since it was free via prime instant.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|sort of like reading a bad book, it just won't get better but once you've begun you can't stand to stop.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|This movie has a lot to offer: drama, comedy, etc. Well worth the small fee to rent. My wife and her mom enjoyed it so much that I figured I'd watch it too before my rental period expired. I was happy I did.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|brolin and penn were perfect, the movie looked great it sounded great, and the good guys dealt some serious hurt.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Very interesting account of a people, a place, and a piece of equipment!<br />Well filmed and paced. Dave Grohl has a nice touch- a bit of a surprise!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show!  The writing and acting is superb!  My whole family has become obsessed with it!  Can't wait to watch the SEason 3!
1936891026|5.0|I  Loved reading this book! Steven was honest and insightful the whole way through and reading it made me know that other creatives are out there experiencing the same things. It was an amazing and uplifting experience reading The War of Art, I can't wait to read it again and again and again! Awesome.
1603427244|5.0|I'm trying to get past scarves to actual garments, so needed some info on different ways of casting and binding. This small book now has a permanent place in my knitting bag (really like the alternating cable cast-on for the bottom of a sweater)
B005LAIIN0|5.0|If you're a father it will bring tears to your eyes as this father tries desperately to save his family. The scenes are fresh and will shock you---if you're watching and care about this family. Many reviewers were watching only for zombies. This is the story of a father and a family.<br /><br />If you want a scientific and logical story about zombies, maybe you're looking in the wrong place. But if you want great acting and characters you can care about---human characters that is, not superheroes--then give it a try.<br /><br />I read as much of the book as I could stand, and it was trash. This film bought the title and started fresh. Kudos to Pitt and company for creating a thoughtful and shockingly fresh film.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easy to use and always get me to what I want to know. Great during family discussions re: politics and individuals.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Great game hours of fun. I definitely recommend it. If you like zombie games you'll love this one. Get it.

B007TB5WE2|4.0|Having lived in Beijing for more than 10 years, the thriller resonates with me. Being the narrative of a true story makes it even more interessting
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Have not had the reason to use it yet. But, I assume it is as good as all the other products I get thru Amazon.
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|Not realistic as far as a criminal investigation goes.  Detectives telling suspect they'll want information later???  Gives them time to come up with phony answers, which they have done more than once in this series.  Lots of more realistic and well done British crime series.  Has not lived up to the reviews I've read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Must read!! If you liked Fifty Shades you will enjoy this book. Of course nothing compare to the Fifty Shades Series!  :)
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This was better than I expected. I'm not familiar with the series but it entertained and had interesting cinematography that was unconventional.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This book has endured centuries for a reason. While the language is a bit outdated and the style strange, this book created border as we know it and deserves a read.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|It is a real stress reliever and makes me laugh out loud. I enjoy dressing the monkey up , also fun.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Addictive and fun this game rocks. I love the graphics and characters. It's awesome they have the same voices like in the show.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Great insight on values, self determination, and getting over hardships. The author has a unique writing style, you really feel her pain and emotions throughout her journey, and you can relate any hard experience in your own life to her pain and journey
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I use Trip Advisor all the time because I travel a lot and I report back to them wherever I have been.  I try to be fair and honest in my ratings because I also rely on other people telling the truth as well.  If I see one terrific rating and the others are not, I believe the &#34;others&#34; are telling me the truth.

0061122416|5.0|I loved every page of it.<br />i was not certain if I was reading or dreaming the story.Very inspiring for every age.
0399255370|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable, this clever book about a crayon revolt was just a plain fun read. Even my teenager laughed all the way through.<br /><br />When poor Duncan decides to color and opens his box of crayons, he finds letters instead. The crayons are tired of being mistreated.<br /><br />The letters are well constructed and the pictures are just perfect. My heart broke a little for poor beige (he's so defeated in his picture ... tired of being called \\"light brown\\" or \\"dark tan\\") ... I couldn't get him out of my head even after I finished, I felt just awful for him.<br /><br />And peach! I laughed at him hiding in the box, naked because he'd been used so much his paper was peeled off.<br /><br />Yellow and orange argue about who is the right color for the sun ... and so much more.<br /><br />If you're looking for a just perfect book to teach words and colors to your preschooler, I highly recommend it. It's amusing for parents as well as kids and just so well done.<br /><br />Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews
B001TH16DI|3.0|I've been a fan since the 80s and have thoroughly enjoyed in their VHS, and DVD formats, which I both bought.  So when the Blu-ray HD version came out,  I knew I'd buy it...eventually.  When it finally came down to the buy-me price, I jumped and ordered it up.<br /><br />The movies themselves are awesome, sound great in 7.1, great HD graphics and fx.  Awesome all around.  Extras are very worthy.<br /><br />However, the packaging I'm going to give an &#34;F&#34; to.  The sleeve is waaay too tight.  It's a wrestling match to get the individual disks out.  Similarly, the inside paper cover of each of the disks is both cheap and ill-fitting.  On one disk, it's cut so bad, you can't see the title on the spine.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />If you're going to only watch this set once, it's great.  If you plan on getting frustrated every time you take it out, think twice.  Great movies, spoilt by crappy packaging.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Dredge
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Super hero movies have become quite popular and Thor is right up there with some of the best ones. Although I am not a big Thor fan, I enjoyed this movie. The Iron man series has got better, so we should look forward to sequel to this one. Thor also ties in to The Avengers which was awesome.
B005HWUCMC|5.0|Would have the loved the nasty version but oh well this is still amazing love her!!!!  This is one of the best cds she has made.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I ride my bike to it, and its perfect.  I loved the movie and this brings back all the great parts I enjoyed.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love having the &#34;newest&#34; and &#34;coolest&#34; tech-toy - which is what drew me to the Chromecast and to order it as soon as I could.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed to realize I had to plug a mini-USB cord into it to power it (our TV has a USB port, so it's not a big deal), but that disappointment is very minimal when I think about it being a no-brainer that a device like this would need to be powered. I'm probably more disappointed that Google didn't accurately portray this in any of the videos/images I saw of it in action.<br /><br />We cast from laptops and smart phones in our home and can honestly say we love the technology and ability!
0385523394|5.0|I had in the last month subscribed to Netflix, and in doing so, I had heard a lot of the hype about the new original series called Orange is the New Black. I watched the 13 episodes in a matter of a couple of days. I have to say I absolutely loved the show. I looked forward to sitting with my new Kindle and watching each new episode. It was really sad to have it come to an end so quickly because I really had enjoyed it so much. I happened to be listening to NPR one day and heard the show Fresh Air with Terri Gross. Her guest that day happened to be Piper Kerman. She is the woman who wrote this memoir of her year in a Women's Prison. I became even more intrigued with the differences that she was telling Terri about from the book to the show on Netflix. I then decided that I really wanted to hear the real story and see what it was like. I didn't hesitate to go right to Amazon.com and pick up a copy of the new paperback book Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison by Piper Kerman. I am very happy that I decided to get the book written by the person who actually lived the story. I will say that Netflix did an excellent job in creating a very good show that really did a super job in mixing in enough things that were for the entertainment factor of the show. It really didn't go overboard too much but just had the right mix in adding things that made the show seem like the story was really in line with Hollywood and at the same time maintaining enough parts of the truth to the real story that the book tells by the author. I am still reading it, but am going to be finishing it within the next two days and I am loving it as much as I loved watching each new show that came out. I really am hoping that Netflix will pick up the series for a second season just because it is a really different and fun show to watch. I would absolutely recommend this book as well as the Netflix original series to anyone. Piper is a very likable character in the show, and person in true life as she tells her story no holds barred. It is very interesting reading about all the wonderful women that she crossed paths with in of all places a prison. There is a lot of flat out honesty that she just tells her story with. It makes you really like her and most of the women that she became close friends with while she was in the Danbury Women's Prison of all places. It isn't like she had a great time being in prison but the way that she tells her story is very much like what I would think it would feel like if it was me who was in her place. All of the new experiences that she confronts and all the kind women who really helped her in the first few weeks of actually getting used to being in prison and the rules that she has to learn and the way that the &#34;old timers&#34; really did a great job in helping her in those first most terrifying early days when she got there really is very touching and extremely entertaining. I can imagine that she must have stayed in touch with some of the women who were going to be there long after she did her year, so that when it was time for mail every day, some of those incredibly kind and important women that Piper did get to know well are rewarded in getting letters from her I have to believe from time to time. Like I mentioned earlier, I would recommend this book to really anyone who enjoys reading about true life and just likes to read a good book every now and then. It really has been great to pick up at any time and plowing through a couple of chapters in one sitting. I am approaching the end of the book so I will miss it, but I have to say it is very touching and honest and entertaining. And not in the way that you would get any kind of pleasure out of someone else's unfortunate story. It is extremely hard to put down and every time I pick it up, I imagine finishing it. But I honestly like to delay the ending because it is such a great book. I think that it would be a very difficult book not to like for just aboutanyone. I say go ahead and grab it for the few $$ that it costs as you get your money back in the honest true story that must have been very hard for Piper to write and remember that year she spent in Danbury when she actually sat down to write the book.<br /><br />I have a younger sister who held the job of a Prison Guard, and I don't understand why she became entwined with that work because I have a hard time picturing the sister that I grew up with doing that kind of unpleasant work. She has since gone into the ARMY for a 5 year stay and has been out for about 8 years now and she is working as a cop in a large city. Something that wasn't expected of anyone in our family where members would pass down the badge of courage, because we didn't come from that type of a family who enjoys doing that, passing the baton on to the next member. It was just something that she ended up in as a line of work. I think mostly because of the power that she must feel when she puts on her uniform and gets into her cruiser everyday for work. She has turned into someone who I haven't known as an adult since she came back from Afghanistan and it has been hard to come to terms with the type of person that she has turned into. To know how she has become a very different person than the girl that I grew up with is extremely hard to deal with because I had never pictured her becoming the type of person that she has truly become. I think that it bothers me because I try to figure out what it was that turned her in the direction that she took because we had the same upper middle class life growing up with two parents who truly loved us and that she could come from such a &#34;normal&#34; family and choose to mix with the dark side of prison, then being in the ARMY, and now being a cop. But that is a whole other story itself. I just want to say that I am truly enjoying this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for something that is a fast and easy book to read! Happyreading if you decide to get it. I hope that this review will help you lean towards buying it! Enjoy!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Loved this show! How more people find out about it, Looking forward to the second season. Rarely do I purchase DVD's anymore, but I bought these so I could share them
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Edits the photos. The photos get edited. Some sooner, some later, a few not at all. It is a beautiful thing.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book was nothing short of amazing. I laughed I got frustrated and I definitely shed more than a few tears at the end. Once again Chris Colfer has written a novel that is so well developed and full of life lessons that everyone needs to be reminded of. Another great book by the very talented Author,singer and actor. Four for you Chris Colfer! You go Chris Colfer!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett obviously does exhaustive research and his narrative of the years after the end of World War II in London, Berlin and Moscow is imminently interesting reading.<br />It does not, however, measure up to Herman Wouk's novel of 'War and Remembrance', the latter being a writer of superior talent.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Beautifully written work of suspense, fantasy, and romance.  Highly recommended for fans of multiple genres.  Provides a pseudo-believable picture of life in modern Japan.
B00735HGQ6|3.0|This book is well crafted with lovely description of the country side. I found it somewhat implausible that the man would undertake such an ardeous journey for a former colleague, though well liked. I found it somewhat long winded but  it becomes amusing along the way, when his pilgrimage catches the attention of the media and its unwanted consequences.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great app to have. I love being able to look up the meaning of words before I include them in messages. This app is very useful and highly appreciated.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Such an incredible show with actors demonstrating a high level of acting ability. I particularly like the banter between characters and the witty, quick, and often devilish responses. This show is quickly becoming my favorite - I just can't believe I didn't discover it sooner. Thanks for making this available, Amazon!!!

B00DQVSTCG|5.0|This was my first Madonna concert, but I have been to many concerts in my life so far. The production for this tour was AMAZING. The dancing, the singing, the lighting, EVERYTHING was amazing. This was one of the best concerts I have ever been to.
0002051850|5.0|Warning: there may be a few SPOILERS in my review. I will try to warn the reader in advance.<br /><br />I have actually read a fair amount of Hemingway. I have read [[ASIN:0743297334 The Sun Also Rises]] (twice), [[ASIN:1476764522 A Farewell to Arms]], [[ASIN:0684801221 The Old Man and The Sea]], [[ASIN:0684803348 The Short Stories]], and [[ASIN:0553132539 A Moveable Feast]]. I have also been reading a fair amount about Hemingway lately. I have learned a great deal about Hemingway's technique, and I have come to admire his craft and artistry, but I have not been able to find any Hemingway book that really moved me or, in my mind, justified his reputation or popularity. Until now. I just finished For Whom the Bell Tolls and I was blown away. I finally feel like I have some understanding of why people love Hemingway and why he is such an important writer. This is, in my opinion, by far Hemingway's best novel. There are, I think, a few reasons for that.<br /><br />First, the novel has the most engaging plot of the Hemingway novels I have read. In general, plot is not all that important to me. I tend to be more interested in the quality of the writing and the philosophical ideas contained in a novel. It was surprising to me, therefore, what a difference having an interesting plot made in terms of my enjoyment of the book. I guess plot does matter! The novel is about an American helping a band of guerillas in the Spanish Civil War blow up a bridge. The novel is very exciting and tense in places and Hemingway paces things perfectly. POSSIBLE SPOILER. The climactic scene on the bridge was, in my opinion, perfectly paced. Hemingway slows things down, not enough to bore the reader, but just enough to keep them on the edge of their seat. Anyone who wants to learn how to pace an action scene would do well to study the bridge scene closely. I was mesmerized.<br /><br />Second, the characters were more interesting than the usual Hemingway characters. I do not tend to like any of Hemingway's characters all that much but I was surprised that I liked all the characters in this book. Robert Jordan is a professional, as so many of Hemingway's heroes are, but he is a likable professional. He has heart and understanding. He forgives people their faults and weaknesses and he is noble. He is also capable of great passion. Pilar and Pablo are very interesting characters as well, each in their own way. I think Hemingway could have done a little better with Maria. She was, of all the characters, the least well drawn to me. She felt secondary to me, like she was put in as a means of making Robert Jordan more interesting, as opposed to being her own independent character with an independent value. Still, the relationship between Robert and Maria was powerful.<br /><br />Third, this novel comes later in Hemingway's career and his style has developed a great deal since The Sun Also Rises. The Sun Also Rises is told in very plain and very direct prose. There is very little lyricism. In For Whom the Bell Tolls Hemingway still uses what he learned from his earlier direct style but it is much more lyrical and beautiful. Everything that was great about his early style is still here but it is better. There is genuine lyricism in the prose. There is no doubt in my mind that Hemingway continued to grow as an artist and this book seems to me to be his most mature statement as an artist. He restrained himself for a long time, he learned control, and here, he has what seems to me to be a carefully controlled unrestraint, as paradoxical as that might sound. He is like a horse trainer who finally has enough control over his horse to let it run wild sometimes. He does not have to keep it tethered all the time.<br /><br />Even more than the lyricism, however, there is passion and feeling in the prose. One of the things I did not like about Hemingway's early style was his penchant for affectless understatement and ironic detachment. I am by no means an expert in Hemingway's development or style but I do not remember any passages like this in The Sun Also Rises &#34;He looked at her brown face and at the eyes that, since he had seen them, had never been as young as the rest of her face but now were suddenly hungry and young and wanting&#34; (67). You can feel the longing in that prose. You can picture Hemingway typing those words and getting caught up in the passion as opposed to remaining stoic and detached all the time. SPOILER ALERT. That is especially true in the farewell scene between Robert and Maria. There have only been two books that have ever brought tears to my eyes and this book is one of them (the other is Cormac McCarthy's [[ASIN:0307387895 The Road]]). The farewell scene between Robert and Maria was very sad and poignant. I had no idea Hemingway was capable of such power. He is less restrained here and it shows.<br /><br />There are a number of really poignant scenes in the book. There is a scene where Robert is remembering back to his childhood when he had to get on a train and go to school for the first time. His dad is very emotional, he is crying, and he says a little prayer before Robert gets on the train. Robert is embarrassed for his father and he says it was the first time he felt older than his father. It is a very poignant and beautiful moment. There is very little of that in the other Hemingway I have read.<br /><br />Finally, the novel deals with some interesting themes. Like all Hemingway novels there is the theme of courage but Hemingway lets us hear the thoughts of his characters as they battle with their own fear in this book in a way that he does not in his other works. Death is also a theme as it is in nearly all Hemingway works. SPOILER ALERT. Robert Jordan expresses beautifully what is so difficult about death. Robert Jordan is an atheist. He does not believe in any afterlife, so he is not frightened by the afterlife. The reason death is difficult is because &#34;The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate to leave it very much&#34; (Robert Jordan's own words) (467). Only Hemingway could have expressed the sadness of having to say goodbye to the world and everything in it so simply and yet so powerfully. This is easily one of the most moving books I have ever read, and I never thought I would say that about a Hemingway book. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone whether you are a Hemingway fan or not.passages like this in The Sun Also Rises &#34;He looked at her brown face and at the eyes that, since he had seen them, had never been as young as the rest of her face but now were suddenly hungry and young and wanting&#34; (67).

Only Hemingway could have expressed the sadness of having to say goodbye to the world and everything in it so simply and yet so powerfully. This is easily one of the most moving books I have ever read, and I never thought I would say that about a Hemingway book. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone whether you are a Hemingway fan or not.
B004R0WKNE|4.0|I thought this was a very entertaining little movie...I was pleasantly surprised! Much more enjoyable than a lot of the movies I've seen lately!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Was really anxious to see this second movie of the reboot.Saw it and loved it.Iam a trekkie from the 60s.Loved TOS and that has made me love tis one even more.Star trek lives on and is making new memories and passions.Love Zachary Quinto as Spock.Loved the whole feeling of it.Can't wait for number three!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was having a hard time between 4 stars or 3, it's a good book with a great read but it was very repeated, I found myself skipping pages and not missing anything, though it's not bad keep an open mind but it's very repetitive.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I have always loved AMD processors.  This one seemed to work particularly smoothly, though this obviously depends on the entire rig, not just the processor.  I was able to run it at 3.8Gz quite stably.  Beyond that and it became quite hot and erratic.  Excellent buy for anybody looking for a good gaming processor on a tight budget.  At the end of the day, it is really your graphics card that counts, so get the cheaper processor and spend the difference on a better card!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book had me on an emotional rollercoaster. I loved it, the way I could feel the joy, heartbreak, lust, love, and all other emotions that Megan and Conner felt. Mira is an excellent author, the way she describes moments make me feel as if I were there. GREAT JOB!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Clean and simple interface, great app. Works well and nice to have Facebook on my Fire. I highly recommend this app.
0545128285|1.0|It never even came! And apparently, it wasn't them, it wasn't a little extra money skipped out on, not laziness; no it was amazon's fault according to them. Because of amazon they absolutely couldn't purchase tracking or insurance, yes that's sarcastic but it was the claim. Now I am without the book and their only intention is to refund me now that I've waited this long for something that isn't even coming and after I have missed out on many other excellent deals for the book. Would not buy from them again as they couldn't even admit their own mistake and have left me without the book I was so excited to own. Left me feeling as though they thought I was stupid and worse yet left me without the book I was so excited for. DON'T DO IT!!!!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This is a TERRIBLE app because it takes Forever for things to work And I have had to restart my kindle from this stupid app. Do not download it! May God bless you and your family's!

B004KBSQBA|5.0|Paul Simon, coupling with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, opened a lot of previously closed minds about World Music.  Not only were there a great many true hits off the album, Simon stretched himself in a direction unheard since Neil Diamond's Tap Root Manuscript a dozen years earlier.<br /><br />Personally, I felt LBM took center stage on that album.  Yes, Simon was there and it was through his influence many now know LBM, but that album would likely not have received the same attention had they not been featured.<br /><br />Is this Simon's greatest work?  I don't think so.  But I never have a problem listening to it.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I found this to be an entertaining movie.  It starts off at a good pace, and while sometimes the plot stalls, never long enough for it to be boring.  Its' an original story, and the end wraps the movie up well.  I would recommend this movie to fans of the science fiction genre.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|Occasionally a group comes along that points people in the right direction... at least for awhile.  The was where U2 made their turn into the political arena.  Again, drawing on my years of my late teens and early 20s living in the UK, U2 brought to life not only \\"The Troubles\\" but the feelings of the people as well.<br /><br />What I liked best about this album compared to many later U2 releases was the \\"This is what we represent\\" attitude which lacks in their more commercial successes.  This was the the time where they collectively said, \\"Screw it.  We will bring the issues to light whether we get rich off it or not\\".  Honestly, I miss that angry, that altruistic voice of theirs.
0061900656|5.0|Got it for our great grandson when a new baby was arriving!  It had some great stories in it to help him adjust to the new baby boy.

B000VM9Z8K|3.0|I enjoyed the story line, but didn't like the bad words that were used frequently. However, I think the book was well written.  We had it as a book club book and it led to interesting conversation.

1932735410|5.0|If you want to pass the PMP exam in your first sit; do not think twice. This book is an essential resource.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Best album since With Teeth. I thought The Slip, Ghosts and Year Zero if combined could create one really great album. This CD far exceeds (in my opinion) those three.  This reminds me of a combination of Downward/Fragile/Teeth. Not as aggressive as Pretty Hate - but you can't have everything.<br /><br />Unlike other reviews, I find the songs melodic, complex and pleasurable to listen to. Pleasantly surprised at the Buckingham contributions and Adrian Belew shows his typical brilliance. Already have tickets for the upcoming tour and I'm already excited to see some of these new songs done live.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor if you have the cash and are a fan - pick this up.

B004UID2LC|4.0|Almost perfect.  Only thing I don't understand is why it downloads an image and an mp4 file.  The lack of a title is probably a shortcoming of the fire.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Another fantastic  film score by James Horner, a must sound track to have for your collection especially if your  a James Horner fan,

B008HVMQ4W|4.0|Brideshead Revisited is about Captain Charles Ryder's curious infatuation and obsession with the wealthy and eccentric Marchmain family. He comes to know them through a chance meeting with the beautiful Sebastian Flyte - the only son of Lord and Lady Marchmain. They form a strange co-dependent relationship with strong homosexual undertones. As the friendship develops we see Charles get sucked into the decadent and frivolous lifestyle of the rich and privileged. Charles seems to not only fall in love with Sebastian but with the whole family and all their pecularities. He sees in them characteristics he wishes to possess. He readily adopts them as his own family.<br /><br />In Charles' review of the past that he so desperately longs to return to we are transported to an England inhabited by a generation that is torn between piety and agnosticism and tradition and modernism. There is also an internal struggle within Charles as he tries very hard to define his own identity and become his own man.<br /><br />This main theme of the book is the past and Charles' battle to not only come to terms with his past but to let it go too. It's a battle he seems to not want to win because he is so convinced that those were his golden years and that he never got to be the man he was meant to be.<br /><br />I had never read anything by Evelyn Waugh before this and after reading Brideshead Revisited I will definitely be reading more of his books. What a pleasant discovery! He is an honest author who writes the most beautifully descriptive and detailed passages that bring scenes and characters to life.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Great images.  Cute idea but my daughter who doesn't usually have trouble walking through a new game seems unsure of what to do next...and yes we've been to a few airports.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|Well, I finally got to take the time to actually listen to this album(The deluxe edition with 3 remixes).  I must say, I have to strongly disagree with the reviewers that don't like this album.  This album is nothing short of amazing. Granted it is MUCH more electronic than his past several guitar dominated albums.  But that's what I love about it. You also have to understand that this review is coming from an electronic musician who can really appreciate all the work that went into this.  This album is a LOT more technical than may sound to the casual listener. To me, this is the NIN I've been waiting for for a long time.<br /><br />\\"The Eater Of Dreams\\" is nothing more than an instrumental intro the album.  It sets up nicely into the next song, but is not really an essential part of the album.  It's short though, so no biggie.<br /><br />\\"A Copy Of A\\" has the most amazing hook I have heard from him in a long time, and it the melody is very catchy.  Love the guitar work of Adrian Belew on it as well.<br /><br />\\"Came Back Haunted\\" is typical Reznorian fare for me.  Not that that's bad...after all...that's what we expect from him...but the song is definitely not exploring any new ground.  It could easy have fit on any of his previous albums.  This song I heard originally that I didn't like much.  But I do like it now, but not the best point on the album.<br /><br />\\"Find My Way\\" starts off sounding like it could have come off of the \\"With Teeth\\" album, but maybe the \\"Dentures\\" version, as it's not quite as aggressive. Almost would fit on his \\"The Fragile\\" album's 2nd disc.  But the lyrics...they are simple, yet something about them just screams \\"I can relate totally.\\"  I love how it builds with the noise sound effects at the end...totally adds to the atmosphere.  Reminds of music that he put in Quake.<br /><br />\\"All Time Low\\" has a very 70's vibe to it. Being the only \\"Explicit\\" song on the album, it's not near as explicit as \\"Closer\\" was from \\"Downward Spiral.\\" I'm not a fan of explicit lyrics when used in the way that they were used in \\"Closer\\" but this song doesn't really bother me much. (Though I still probably wouldn't play it for my children). While it is very non-typical Reznor, it is also very typical as well.  Leave it to him to paradox himself.  I don't think I recall him ever doing falsetto before...very 70s.  But by the time he gets to the 1:40 mark in the song, NIN comes back with the dirty electronic drums and the voice he is known for.  I would be about to say this is the weakest song on the album UNTIL about 4:30 into the song when he goes into the \\"Stretch across the sky\\" part.  I love how he layers the music.  Reminds me of Final Fantasy music in a weird way.  But I love it.<br /><br />\\"Disappointed\\" to me, is another strong point. While it is another \\"slower\\" song, this is another song in typical Reznorian style keeps the same musical phrase throughout the entire song but builds upon it, making it more intense until it finally becomes so frantic that when it ends, you feel like you can finally take a breath.  To me, the music in this song would fit in a dark / creepy movie.<br /><br />\\"Everything\\" is an anomaly for me.  It sounds like he may be going for radio play on this song. It's not that I don't like it, but it almost sounds like it should be on someone else's album...especially when he gets to the \\"Wave goodbye\\" part.  It's just so...happy sounding.  The lyrics imply that he finally broke free of something that had been holding him back.  Hopefully his drug / alcohol addictions.  Overall, I like it, but it's not one I'd hunt for on the radio.  But I think the song means more to him than maybe to us, the listeners.<br /><br />\\"Satellite\\" has a great bass sound that I bet would totally shake the walls on a good sub-woofer, but the song does lack memorable riffs and lyrics.  Definitely a weak point on the album for me, but I do like the bit where he keeps repeating \\"Satellite, I'm watching you\\", but I'mnot sure that it's memorable enough for me to play this album just for this song. I also find it weird that he fades this song out at the end.  That's very rare for him.<br /><br />\\"Various Methods Of Escape\\" is one of my favorite spots on the album.  From the drum pattern and flanged vocals on the verses, and the big sound on the chorus.  The song is one of the more accessible songs on the album, but he doesn't lose his sound on this one at all.  It's very much a NIN song especially when it gets to the whispered \\"I think I could lose myself in here\\" all the way to the end. One of my very favorite songs on the album.<br /><br />\\"Running\\" has an almost tribal feel to the drum pattern. I love all the crazy whispered lines.  Then the chorus...with that absolutely strange keyboard patch that almost sounds out of key, but somehow sounds perfect.  The guitar work in this song is different, but I can't imagine anything else either.  I also love how this song builds toward the end to an almost chaotic sound and then gets really quiet again and then ends.  Really cool.<br /><br />\\"I Would For You\\" has one of the best sounding choruses he's written in a long time.  The song actually reminds me more of Bowie at times.  (Excuse me, you got your Bowie in my NIN).  Lyrically, this is THE strong point on the album.  I love the lyrics on many songs on this album. They actually have hope in them.  That's one thing that annoys me about some of his previous efforts.  The lyrics have been dark, (which I actually don't mind), but to me, they didn't sound honest at times.  These lyrics, while dark, seem to have a sense of hope at times.  I like that.<br /><br />\\"Split In Two\\" is one of the more aggressive points on the album.  It's also one of the very strongest points as well.  I love his use of falsetto on this album, and this song nails it. This song tops my all time favorite NIN song from before, which was \\"All The Love In The World\\" from the \\"With Teeth\\" album.  The chorus is just so dang cool.  \\"It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart.\\" Again, the ending of the song gets really quiet and slowly builds up to a very catchy hook that turns into chaos.  A trademark for him that few people can pull off.  He's the master of this and once again, he proves it on this song as it melds right into the next song...<br /><br />\\"While I'm Still Here\\" seems very appropriate for today with lyrics like \\"Yesterday I found out the world was ending.\\"  Definitely one of the quieter songs on the album, but quiet doesn't equal weak, though I have to wonder what he was thinking with the saxophone at the end. That is definitely the most bizarre point of the entire album.<br /><br />\\"Black Noise\\" is a nice close to the album.  It's mostly noise and a mild drum beat, and is really no more essential than the opener of the album. Take it or leave it.<br /><br />\\"Find My Way - Oneohtrix Point Never Remix\\" has a totally different feel than the original version.  The pipe organ and choir / voice sounds really set a cool atmoshpere and I almost wish there were more songs like this on the bonus disc, especially when it veers to the almost Yngwie Malmsteen riffing for a few moments. I'm just bummed that didn't last longer.<br /><br />\\"All Time Low - Todd Rundgren Remix\\" is definitely an interesting moment.  It definitely has the Rundgren touch to it, though it totally ditched the 70s sound Trent put in it and got bumped up a decade to the 80s.  Not the 80s music you heard on the radio.  The 80s music that was the B-Sides of the songs you actually loved. Believe it or not, it almost reminds me of Tears For Fears more unusual cuts from the \\"Songs From The Big Chair\\" days.  Not super crazy about this one.<br /><br />\\"While I'm Still Here - Breyer P-Orridge 'Howler' Remix\\" - The person who remixed this remixed this as a duet with Trent.  The problem is, he made his own voice louder than Trent, and he can't sing nearly as well. Musically, it's interesting enough with a slightly more minimalistic approach, but it works for what it is, though I don't know that I find this song to be strong enough to make this bonus disc even worth listening to. Strange that he left the weird sax in when almost nothing else from the original song remains.  Also, the spoken part that the remixer put in just...does not fit very well for me.  His voice has an almost Vincent Price<br /><br />All in all, the bonus disc sorta sucks.  The actual disc is quite good, and musically amazing.o dang cool.  \\"It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart.\\" Again, the ending of the song gets really quiet and slowly builds up to a very catchy hook that turns into chaos.  A trademark for him that few people can pull off.  He's the master of this and once again, he proves it on this song as it melds right into the next song...<br /><br />\\"While I'm Still Here\\" seems very appropriate for today with lyrics like \\"Yesterday I found out the world was ending.\\"  Definitely one of the quieter songs on the album, but quiet doesn't equal weak, though I have to wonder what he was thinking with the saxophone at the end.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|Customizable, works well for a very picky white noise addict. The brown noise is my favorite, I have yet to be disappointed.
B005DZMODI|3.0|I remember when this concert took place and I was heartbroken that I couldn't get tickets. After buying the album, I'm glad that I couldn't attend the concert. I LOVE Clapton and was really psyched about this album. It is, to put it mildly, a MAJOR disappointment. It's more a Wynton Marsalis album than a true collaboration. Clapton supposedly picked the songs but Marsalis did all the arrangements. That was a big mistake. The tunes all have a very similar sound. I like Dixieland and love blues but this album is just not working. The arrangements showcased Marsalis but Clapton was wasted. What a shame. This should have been a great album. Maybe Marsalis should leave the arranging to someone else?
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great Grand daughter loves this game and I too enjoy playing this game from time to time. now is the time to move to the next level
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|This is a simply masterful work of art. I sometimes forget this is a metal album purely because of the passion exuded in the words and the heart of this band. Progressive in the best of ways. Such an uplifting album.
B005HED08I|5.0|No matter how much I love all the different sequals to Star Trek, I always come home to the original.  Without it, there would be no Next Gen, Voyager, etc and although the acting is sometimes campy, the thought process behind Gene Roddenberrys cult classic was groundbreaking.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a great biography, very inspirational. I think it worst the reading and i really recommend it even if you don't like Steve Jobs at all, it's very interesting to know how he could do what he did.
B005V20JKI|1.0|The entire concept of this game is completely contrary to any idea of fun I can conjure. You run around generic, Mario Bros-style stages collecting muffins that assign you random classes, half of which are ineffectual at contending with constantly spawning enemies and irritating to use. Better yet, more muffins means more terrible characters, so your chances of getting an actually competent class gets thinner and thinner the more you play. Talk about rewarding gameplay! Of course, you can level up each unit to make them slightly more tolerable, but only to a small degree. The level caps out at 20 and demands you pay money to max them all out. Basically, the game gets harder as you play it and you're expected to fork over more money to reduce the inherent frustration of its nonsensical gameplay. Awful.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|All three movies on Bluray and tons of extra material at a really good price. Totally recommended for everyone who loves these movies.
030758836X|4.0|With all the buzz surrounding this thriller last summer, I picked it up with much anticipation and some lurking skepticism that it would turn out to be some glitzy hollywood paint-by-numbers hit. Well, it has become a screenplay, and Rosamund Pike (ex-Bond girl) and Ben Affleck have been cast as the movie's leads even as I write, so yes, in some ways, the novel has a certain made-for-the-screen stamp on it. But that is not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn was an ex-TV critic for Entertainment Weekly, and her writing betrays the easy wit of a columnist, which makes Gone Girl a very readable novel. The premise is simple; a glamor wife goes missing, and her younger, debonair husband with the handsome bad boy looks becomes a prime suspect. But what truly engages is the way the author pulls you into the inner world of the two protagonists by way of their first-person narratives that form the alternating chapters and different versions of events begin to spill, even as the reader grapples with believing what these characters say. Are they truly who they say they are? Flynn refrains from giving an omniscient perspective (quite rare in this genre) and it works, because she manages to dole out the clues to the case morsel by morsel, bringing the story to an astonishing conclusion.<br /><br />It is easy to scoff and pronounce the plot derivative in the way the reader's expectations are thwarted, but Flynn does pace her novel well, and takes her reader on a thrilling ride.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Hard not to fall in love with this series and its amazing cast!! It's a must see for all closet bikers & biker b's!!
1439153663|5.0|This was a &#34;page turner&#34; for me.  I've read other excellent historical fiction on slavery, but this had such a fascinating twist as an Irish girl is put into the position of indentured servant and raised and trained by the slaves on a plantation.  Her life is quite confusing for her as she feels she is part of the family of the slaves but is later treated so differently because she is white.  The tense situations for all of the characters keeps ones attention from beginning to end.  My worry was that it would be too similar to The Help, but it is totally different due to difference of the times and situations.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|We love this series as well as this author!  Rick Riordan's books make the Egyptians and ancient history come alive!!  Adventure, a crush, but nothing too suggestive, graphic or leading for my 11 year old to lose herself in.  We love them!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this product blows the stock android and swype keyboards away not only does it look better and has way more settings , the predictability of what you are typing is awesome .
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|I tried the free version, and when you set the alarm clock it turns the alarm up to the max, even if you turn your volume all the way down. But it does its job; waking you up, that's for sure. Just not 3$ worthy, maybe 99&cent;?
B006S08RLU|5.0|Great, great, great, movie.  Atmosphere and the acting was great great great. Again had to say great a lot to meet requirement of minimum number of words to give a opinion of the movie.<br />,
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|What I like most about this case is you dont have buy a whole new caseto change things up, just a new back plate. The price is amazing and the case itself is better then some cases two times as much.<br /><br />I've dropped my phone a number of times and it still looks good, with NO damage to the phone. I like that it is slim but not too slim, has grip but it's not bulky.

B0000AQS0F|1.0|While the series is very interesting (based on episodes I've caught in re-runs), the DVDs in this set are defective.  Disks do not play on multiple players or in computers.  This has been noted in other recent reviews.  I'll be happy to re-evaluate if/when Amazon gets their inventory purged of the defective product and replaced with playable disks.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gives a well written and well thought-out perspective on the afterlife. It's descriptions are right along the lines of what I have been learning while studying Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Spiritualism.  I hope that many people within the medical community will read this book. Thank you for writing and publishing your experience.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|It was a used CD with that had a crack on the center ring (where the sticker paper usually is).  The Cd works fine, I am just worried for future use that it may crack through the actually CD part.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|its not a bad game but it could be a little funner....there is a few detects to it...once in a while it will freeze up but other than that not a bad game
B006FPFTMS|3.0|It has a lot of features similar to iPad note taking apps. But lately I've been having problems with the app syncing files to my Dropbox. It always seems to fail when I try.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|i love this angry birds you litterally float and have to aim for a bubble it is a really fun game!
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I got this program to help with the volume control. I had to get a cheap pair of head phones that made it hard to hear my muaoc, but with this app that was no longer an issue.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It took me a few weeks here and there to get used to this app, as I found it somewhat overwhelming at first.  Now I use it to search for repurposing and decorating ideas, and I enjoy the inspiration!
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Omg i luv it so much cause im like a HUGE big time rush fan!!! &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B006LSZECO|2.0|I wanted more story and less time in the writers head.  While I learned a lot about how people rationalize infidelity, I still found it hard to like the heroine.  I longed for something to happen and found the long segues into the past a lot of telling and not much showing.
145551389X|5.0|Well that's an amazing picture book. You travel with Mother Monster through Terry's eye.<br /><br />A must have if you like both of them...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely adore this series. Found the series recently and was hooked from the first episode.  Can't wait for the next season!
B003UAMWWQ|3.0|It was less funny on this viewing, some 25 years later.  Still, many of the jokes made us laugh anyway.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you haven't read GOT please do.  Third book finished for the second time and on to the fourth for the second time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this little game. It has LOTS of levels, so that's fun (and all for free). It does give you hints, but when you run out of hints you either have to just work it out or pay for a hint. I do not pay for hints! :-)  I just keep working on that puzzle until I get it. And sometimes it takes a few days. But it is SO satisfying when you finally get it. It's also a nice game to have on the Kindle for when I'm waiting for something (a doctor to come in for the appointment or in line at the store) because it is easy to play, quick, and if you have to close the Kindle, when you open it again, you haven't &#34;lost your work.&#34; You can keep trying to get those pesky dots connected up.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|The best alien movie ever! You can't stop laughing & just about everyone from Hollywood is in it. My four year old gran-daughter loves it too!
059306495X|2.0|Dan Brown will never be dead whilst this author is still writing.  I can accept that novel writing requires a suspension of belief but do we have to throw it completely out the window?  Good writing keeps you engaged but shouldn't insult you.<br />Spoiler alert here!!!  Halfway through the book our hero is sent to a middle Eastern country to try and find clues to the person who threatens to kill probably millions of Americans.  Plucked out of nowhere by someone, ahead obviously of thousands of more probable candidates, who incidentally would still be in the intelligence game, then sent no less by the President and head of National Security.  So what does he do?  Gets involved in a murder investigation! Then wastes two days in that while we are left wondering what happened to his original job description.  All this apparently so the author can show off his knowledge about far fetched and highly unlikely murder investigation clues and technical issues which have nothing to do with his main task - many, many pages are wasted on this exercise.  No doubt at some point the author will link back to this work to justify his excursion.  I hope I get that far, there's a strong chance I won't but I don't like to give up on any book.<br />The author is obviously talented but please keep to the story or use side story lines that are relevant not seemingly an idea for another novel you didn't get around to writing!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Yeah, so THOR is just one more Marvel character in the mix of all of the characters. But the movie is a staple in our house.<br />The vendor shipped and the DVD and it was delivered in perfect condition.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great show. Great season. Cast is great. Writing is top notch. Whenever the show ends, it will be too soon.
B005HSL626|5.0|I was slicing and dicing then I hit a bomb and blew up.  It kept me and my little girl entertained though.  Deep down we want to be ninja's but mom won't let us.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Whenever this show ends, it will be too soon. A welcome change from the brain dead trash on TV like NCIS.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|He is a great writer, and this book is very moving.  How this isn't a movie yet I'll never know.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is a must read for fans of action and mythology turned into something truly original. Percy, Grover, and Annabeth are hilarious and EPIC!!! Best adventuring trio EVAH!!!!
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|Having been a fan of Guy Clark from the instant I first heard &#34;She Ain't Going Nowhere (She's Just Leaving)&#34; back in '84, I was very disappointed in &#34;Workbench Songs.&#34; This collection is dramatically better than that one. While &#34;Workbench&#34; had several songs that didn't do a thing for me, &#34;Favorite Picture&#34; has none that are a waste of time and several that are quite good. &#34;Heroes&#34; is both poetic and haunting, &#34;Waltzing Fool&#34; verges on poignancy and &#34;Standing in the Rain in Durango&#34; has a really nice blend of melody and story. &#34;Coyote&#34; toys with the maudlin with its stereotypical story of betrayed immigrants but Clark's poetry saves it from descent.<br /><br />My hands-down favorite from this group is &#34;Death of Sis Draper.&#34; The bluegrass mood and rhythm are perfect accents for the story and folk music collectors will enjoy the creative blending of &#34;Shady Grove&#34; for the musical breaks. For me, the true quality of a group of songs emerges in the listening over time. I came to like &#34;Corn Meal Waltz&#34; and &#34;Favorite Picture&#34; more when I listened the third time; several of the others I liked instantly.<br /><br />This isn't Guy Clark's best release but how can a legend be legendary every time for five decades? It's certainly a fine grouping and well worth the money.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This spin-off of Stargate SG-1 has a lot of what made the original series great--good solid writing, good actors, and a sense of humor. Plus really bad villains. What more could you ask?<br /><br />Except for the fact that they still keep killing off the doctors (seriously, what is up with that?), it's a taut, well-written series, at time funny, at times very thought-provoking. Just what good sci-fi ought to be.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Disliked characters and story-usually this writers work is more fun and I was very disappointed in this depressing book- thumbs down
B001UTW7QU|5.0|. . . I just do. Interesting characters, interesting plot lines--both the arcs and the individual episodes. Even my non-science-fiction-loving brother has gotten hooked on the series.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Good game. Wish it had more hints. It is a little difficult playing on such a small screen. I have it on my kindle fire.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I wasnt sure if i liked the idea of water and dvds mixed but its a very good quality product. Even if waters spills a little it wont harm anything. The item as a whole is great looking and great quality, absolutely fantastic piece for your shelf if your a walking dead fan.
0307744434|3.0|There's a great story concept and aesthetic sensibility at work in this book, as noted by many other reviews. But I think the writing falls flat and undermines the story's potency. I stopped reading after the chapter describing a dinner party where we're told that these characters' witty remarks kept the conversation going perfectly, and so-and-so's comments were always perfectly timed. That's fine if you're describing a scene in a movie or outlining a plot -- but what kind of writer simply declares this to the reader, without bothering to actually write the dialogue that would show it? Unfortunately the whole book is like this. The author gives extensive effort to describing the way things look, which a lot of people clearly like. But she comes up short in describing the people who populate her landscape. Other reviewers have noted the fairy-tale like quality of the writing, which I agree with, inasmuch as fairy-tale characters tend to be completely flat, quasi-allegorical figures with zero character development throughout the plot. (Also, a personal nitpick: it's told in the present tense, which I think works for a few books but fails in most; this book is definitely the latter.)<br /><br />These perceived defects were enough to make me stop reading about a third of the way through. I've got some regret about not knowing what happens, but this is mitigated by me not caring enough about the two-dimensional characters to bother with the hundreds of pages that remained.<br /><br />I could definitely be being too finicky here; it's better than a lot that's out there. But I'd recommend a library version (sorry, Amazon) in case, like me, you decide it's not worth it in the end.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|There are times that I want to read a book that is heavy. One that I have to keep notes on the characters just to keep them straight (i.e., Ludlum). But then there are times that I want to read something outrageous and funny (Evanovich). But often I want to read a book that is a good story, light but not too light, and happy as well as romantic. Finding Pride is such a book. I've not had the opportunity to read the other books in this series, but I will asap. I recommend this romantic, happy, light (but not too light) and good-story book.
B005G02RIC|1.0|I rated this the lowest because I couldn't open it to enjoy it.  I'm new at this and don't know what I need to do, I'd like to send it back and get my money back.  l won't want another of this recording since it most likely does not have subtitles.  I've already ordered another more recent recording.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|subway surfers is fun I spent hours playing.If you want a fun and besent game to play you should download subway suffers.
140006922X|5.0|This is a beautifully written account of the life of Jesus.  It provides clearly the history of the times which complements the writings of Marcus Borg, Dominic Crossan, and John Spong which have made my faith come alive.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|I found the book to be very primary. It was very tongue in cheek. As an artist I didn't really like it. Very simple to read.
B0013V33DG|1.0|I rated it low because I was not able to open it and don't know what to do, how to send it back.  I don't want another of this recording since it most likely does not have subtitles.
B00846REIS|5.0|Enjoyed it as much as Fifty Shades - maybe even more?? Not as kinky but still quite hot! Looking forward to next book.
1452113432|5.0|Nicely written.  Easy to follow the recipes, simple and have that French taste you are looking for.  A must for any cook.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|enjoy playing the game, but not will to pay extra money every time I need to get more cards.  They give you a few to start off with and a few each day, but they should all be based on $ earned in the game.  I shouldn't have to pay more actual money for more cards.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|A very well-crafted drama. Contrary to what the trailers would have you believe, this is not an action movie, it's a drama through-and-through. Mostly centers on the three main characters, with a handful of supporting characters for balance. Languid setting of rural riverboat Mississipi. Love, honor, lies, good and bad intentions. We don't know what Mud's true intentions are until the end. The boys, on the other hand, are transparent throughout, providing a nice counterbalance to Mud. All in all, a very well thought out story, with deeper meanings just like the deeper undercurrents of the rivers that the story is set on.<br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys drama, character studies, a bit of suspense, a bit of action, and a bit of romance.
1449325947|5.0|Aside from the well written technical content, the book also has great web design advice. It also includes many links in each chapter to dig even deeper if you so choose. And lastly, the tutorials are not just a rehash of the chapter's content, but also provide even more insights into what is being taught.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0962477060|4.0|It's about as complicated as flying a Helicopter.  What else can we say?  No words can describe it if you don't play guitar.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great novel by Mr. Hosseini.  The characters are mesmerizing and the entwined story lines kept me wanting to read straight through.  I downloaded this before a flight and was so glad I had something to enjoy as I sat I a very uncomfortable seat.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I didn't think this game would be very interesting but I heard from some cousins that it was fun. Tried it and was hooked after the first few games.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have the weather available whenever I wish.  I would recommend that everyone have this.  It is really important in case of a violent storm approaching.
B005KLN056|5.0|This was a totally awesome Blu-Ray!  The clarity was awesome but as far as Slash and his performance, he knocked it out of the park along with his Conspirators.  Along with Myles Kennedy from Alter Bridge on vocals, you couldn't tell sometime whether it was Myles or Axl Rose up there singing (although Myles does a much better job).  I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray to anyone that is a fan of Slash and/or Myles Kennedy.  It was great!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I played this game when I was young and enjoyed it, but playing this on my kindle is kinda hard.  It's hard to move pac-man around with my finger.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This band has matured into Legend status with Brave New World. I never take this album out of the MP3 selection in my car and I play it for every new person just getting turned on to Maiden when I can. There are too many positives to really sum up this great album. I suggest you throw your money at your screen and order this today! You won't be disappointed and if you are an old-school fan or a young-blood, this collection of finely crafted tunes will deliver the rock n roll you have been searching for. These guys are wizards of their craft and you are going to love cranking up your stereo once again. Up the Irons \m/
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|The game was not not bad but very very repetitive.  Got boring pretty fast.  Already uninstalled from all my devices.
B000UUF69A|5.0|Great movie!!!...awesome and enjoyed With the family..I really recommend..I love the turtles when I was a kid and still do..now my kids and I watch together...
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Awesome show and modern re telling of the Green Arrow comic. If you like The Dark Knight Trilogy and Man of Steel, you'll like this!
B000002JSN|5.0|A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY ONE. IN THE LIGHT. DOWN BY THE SEASIDE. IF YOU WANT A AWESOME LEGENDARY ROCK BAND TO SHOW THEY WERE MORE THEN JUST STAIRWAY THEN YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR COLLECTION.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I really love that this book is action-packed over a two-day period.  I can't remember another Cornwell novel having such a short timeframe (not that another one hasn't it's just hard to recall after having read about 20 of her books) but this aspect of the setting really helps the reader experience the frenetic pace at which Scarpetta is working and one almost becomes as exhausted as she does thinking about having two really long days like this.  As usual, Cornwell's forensic homework is done and her technical knowledge is sharp.  I'm always ready for another Scarpetta novel!
B000002MFE|5.0|NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS UNPLUGGED MTV LIVE CD. I REMEMBER 20 YEARS AGO WAITING FOR IT TO COME ON AND EVERY SONG IS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT EVEN BETTER AS IT WAS THEN. CLAPTON NO DOUBT IS AMONG THE BEST TO EVER PLAY, WRITE AND SING. I'VE LOST A SON AND TEARS IN HEAVEN REFERRING TO THE LOSS OF HIS SON IS ALWAYS A TEAR DROPPER. BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME, LAYLA, ALBERTA, THE LIST GOES ON. GREAT THING MTV DID WHEN THEY WERE STILL RESPECTABLE. CLAPTON PULLS YOU IN AND YOU LIVE THE SONGS AS HE SINGS EM.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|JUST STARTED BUT IT GIVES YOU ENOUGH HINTS THAT YOU CAN PROCEED TO NEXT LEVEL.  ONE OF BETTER HO GAMES I PLAYED.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. There lots of HO scenes and places to visit. Great graphics too. The only problem I had was that it took way too long to download on my Kindle Fire, over 30 minutes and a lot of memory.
B0084670FU|3.0|I guess I didn't get the timeline of Pitt talking to his child on the phone.<br />I don't think I would pay money to watch this.
B005COO1X6|2.0|While Stephen King's prose is always polished, I felt let down by this one.  In the end, he didn't tie up the story -- it couldn't have happened.  I will suspend belief with the best of them, but this one let me down.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very enjoyable book that was thought provoking as well as heart tugging.  None of the characters were saints but were likable.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|yall dont need to yell about the apps all games have apps and its useless to get mad about them. its an awesome game so just enjoy it!!!!!!!!!
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|I have always loved this movie and wanted to get it in DVD.  I love having movies such as this to watch whenever I want to.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan frames his biography in the milieu in which Jesus lived. It is very different from the traditional Christian version of the holy land. Jesus was one of several individuals who filled similar revolutionary niches. The key question (unanswered) is why Jesus lasted and others became historical footnotes. Also interesting, and seldom addressed today is the friction between the designated followers of Jesus--his brother James and Peter--and later converts--mainly Paul. Paul has come to dominate modern Christian theology, while the views of the literal descendants of Jesus are largely ignored.<br /><br />For me this book was a real eyeopener and has made me reconsider what I thought I knew about the rise of the Christian church.
1598561634|5.0|As a Hebrew studies/Middle Eastern Studies major, I purchased this book for a college course that I had signed up for at the last minute.  I was concerned that there would be a short delay in the arrival of the book with the labor day holiday, however, the book arrived before the holiday itself.  The seller stated that the book is new and it was in EXCELLENT condition.  Thanks seller for your speedy delivery time.  Considering what you pay for s&h, the cost of the book didn't break my wallet or my budget.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|There is no way to simply get familiar with this game, unless I just missed it.  I wanted to learn the basics of the game but it immediately put me in competition with another person.  Disappointing.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Extremely Enjoyable read!!!  Interesting plot twists and lifelike characters.  Cleverly written from different points of view. You don't want to put it down.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|enjoyable memories and great music,  Go back in time to the mid 1970's and relax and smile and sing along.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I bought \\"The Camel Club\\" years ago in hardback and I loved it so much I decided to download it to have on Kindle. This book started my love story with David Baldacci, and though I have thrilled over almost every book he has written, there is no love like a first love. The Camel Club is where the reader is first introduced to Oliver Stone and his band of misfits - 4 in all - including Oliver. Each of these men are in someway an outcast in society, yet each man also possesses some type of skill that makes him valuable to the band of brothers. Oliver as a former licensed killer for the US government, is the most valuable of them all, and has long since left the agency under less than ideal terms. He lives in a graveyard caretaker's cottage and spends most of his time in a tent outside of the White House where he, in his own quiet way, protests the many dirty dealings perpetrated by our elected officials and military.<br /><br />What's not to love in Oliver Stone and his friends - cleaning up Capitol HIll one conspiracy at a time!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I definitely didnt expect this to be a very good film but it was freakim awesome! Constant randomness and hilarious lines and EVERYONE could sing really good. Def. A winner in my b9ok :0)
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|this is one of those records that you have to listen to  a lot it sinks in gradually like many of Bowie's great collaborations with Brian Eno. Sounds like it could have come out after Scary Monsters. Too bad it is not getting the buzz it should get. As I have said to friend this will be all the rage in 20 years.LOL.
B00BY8DC2A|5.0|Amazing album but I really do miss N'dea Dvenport.Dawn Joseph is a great singer but she can't handle the material as well as N'Dea. Love it when Jan Kincaid steps to the plate and belts out a few songs - really great!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This exceptional biography places the life of Christ in historical perspective within the Roman Empire and Jewish religious hierarchy of first-century Palestine, while tracing the rise of Christianity.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The show is very close to the book.  I do prefer the book since it's easier to keep track of everyone.  I literally cried at certain parts since George R. R. Martin is pretty sadistic to his characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My sister first got this game. I asked her what she was playing, and I just had to get it for myself. This game is very intriguing. More levels would be awesome.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Still reading it, but it's an excellent book so far.  I prefer the books to the shows.  It's easier to keep track of the characters, since they keep dying off like flies!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Best Season so far! My daughter is a huge fan and is begging me to buy '67 Impala no center post 4 door.
B007C12RDS|5.0|This show is engaging without being overly melodramatic or too fluffy. It is definitely entertaining! There are times while watching the show that I didn't realize hours had passed!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great story line. Great actors. My husband and I love watching it. We can't wait to see the next season.  Hope it never ends.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the drama mixed with suspense. I can't stop watching what Harvey and Mike will do next, it's a must watch.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|I wasn't a huge fan. Like the gore factor but the movie just seemed poorly acted and boring. My teenage son loves it, thus the reason we watched it. Not every movie is for everyone.
140006922X|5.0|There is enough material to demand a reread and a study.  The material is thought provoking yet written in an extremely readable style.  The author blends his creative writing background with his religious studies background well.  Buy the book and enjoy
B009WUBERW|3.0|Probably not what they are going for (cute) but I loved seeing the bad-a** team come together in one movie. The cohesion, especially towards the end was definitely entertaining.  I thought Booker looked a bit creepy.  I think they CGI'd his face to make him look more filled out and I just thought it was weird looking.  Great entertainment value.
B000002N25|4.0|Not my favorite MK, but pretty good regardless.  Happily add it to my collection and look forward to placing it in rotation
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|the music the stars, its all great...i just hope they dont take it off the air...if they havent already..im ready for more..
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I am Always on the look out for more from this phenomenal series from Josh Whedon.  Watched it countless times already.
B00CSYRHG6|1.0|The movie is really good especially considering was done by Goro Miyazaki and it should get 5 stars but the voice dubbing is really disappointing.<br />Yelchin with his raspy voice was the worst choice ever and Bolger was as well sounding like an old women. Biggest complaint with the kids - why all the voices sounds so old?<br />Why did they choose them for young teenager voices? - are those people getting the job only because they are friends with director or something?<br />They did good job with \\"Spirited Away\\" and other movies but screwed up so badly here.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|If you finish games too quickly, this is the game for you. It is anything but free, when you get into it. Hours of enjoyment, but not all at once. Good for those who get buried in a game...unless you want to go broke buying energy it limits your playing time.
0140157352|5.0|Although it is an used book which was a second edition published an printed in 1991, it looks like a new one expect for paper having become yellow. But this yellow paper book appeals to me.
B004AP9W46|5.0|This is a spell binding tale of my beloved vampire, Lestat, and his puzzling encounter with The Devil and God. It really made me think and wonder....a must read!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This is a good interesting action  zombie movie good actors good producer director ..good fx ..no too much blood... Bunch of zombies run faster than 28 days and dawn of the dead..the infection is different and interesting .. good for the family 14 up ..good movie grab your popcorn enjoy !! bluray good quality
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Bizarre<br />But I couldn't stop reading it. It is not a typical war novel.  It's just a different way of telling a story.
B009RX85N0|5.0|This is the 2nd season of the Storybook tales set as a TV series. My two teenage daughters and I really like this series. My daughter requested this as a birthday gift. We've enjoyed several &#34;movie&#34; nights watching it as a family. I felt the price for the amount of enjoyment received was well worth it. As I write this, my daughters are on their second viewing.
B009EEMFSI|1.0|Won't play through, I needed to watch it for a homework assignment, and I wasted 16 dollars. And Eff my instructor with a meaningless phd in music
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Lord ham mercy. I don't even know what else to say, this book wasn't at all what I was expecting when it first came out, and I didn't read any reviews at all. My mother in law recommended it too me, so I thought it was a harmless book. Every time I read, I'd start panting like a wild animal wanting to be taken by a beast. Now, since the movie cast is out, I can just fantasize about that hella sexy Charlie hunnam...OUCH OUCH!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|perfect! neither too easy nor too hard. the last 2 levels were very challenging, but stick to it and you'll figure it out :)
B003G94BZC|5.0|This show is great - but you need to start at the first show(s) of the season. We started somewhere in the middle, and it made no sense until we re-started at the beginning.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great read!!! Totally hooked. Have read all three books twice already. The best I've read since twilight series!!!
0143119680|1.0|Then this book is for you. I think the author doesn't know how to transition from scene to scene, so the main character is perpetually exhausted and frequently falls into deep sleeps (usually, she's ordered to sleep by those around her, especially her boyfriend/vampire-husband); when she wakes up, new scene! Convenient! Very early on, the heroine accepts that her vampire lover will control her life by telling her where she can and can't go, when to eat, and what sorts of activities will happen in her day. He carries her around a lot (as noted above, she is perpetually exhausted, probably from being bossed around so much). Consistent with the gender politics of this novel, although the heroine supposedly has an extraordinary amount of power, she can only seem to unleash it when she's experiencing a powerful emotion inspired by her man, and then she can't control it. Once it passes through her, she's tired yet again and her boyfriend is at her to sleep and eat.  As pointed out by other reviewers, her vampire boyfriend is an uber-boring character, and the novel lingers over laughable details like the heroine's wardrobe (spoiler-alert: she wears a lot of black yoga pants) and love of rowing. I think the book is interesting primarily as yet another example (along with Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey) of how much our society loves these gender dynamics. Women have unique women-power, accessed only through emotion (especially feelings of protectiveness toward man and family), that must be properly controlled by men. Women are base creatures that desperately need to eat and sleep, but need a man to manage them into doing both. As long as we make the male partner into a supernatural being, then it's fine for him to be domineering, controlling, isolating, and borderline abusive - in fact, it's great! The more controlling he is, the more women can tap into those crazy emotions and use them to cleave even more stubbornly and strongly to him and any children they (god forbid)might have. Sentences that are uttered by the male protagonist and accepted without comment include, \\"I'll kill you myself before I let anyone hurt you.\\" And that's a wrap.
B000002LHX|5.0|This soundtrack bring memories i remember have it on tape n the summer n 89 when the movie came out until this day i can still bang this soundtrack and out of all the batman soundtracks this is the best one. And i love the 1st movie too the batman the summer of 89 was jumping lol
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Expert pacing with awesome visuals and a stand out cast make this one of the best movies of the summer 2013
B004XJNPAQ|4.0|Nicholas Cage is unremarkable - good but not much different from any other action role he's played. Amber Heard is better, but again, nothing to write home about. However, the Accountant (William Fichtner) makes the movie - definitely the best part, and well makes the movie into something worth watching.
B00CJ7EK4E|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Rod Stewart.  His latest CD &#34;Time&#34; is one of my favorites!  The last track &#34;Pure Love&#34; is my most favorite single from the CD.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It can be difficult to find a fun and challenging game that keeps everyone's interest for long, this is a great game for that.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great read.  Deep, meticulous, thoughtfully written.  The psychological<br /> insights alone are worth the price of admission. I will recommend this book to friends and strangers.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I am still reading this and about half finished. I am at awe with Sherlock Holmes and his methods and really look forward to how he sees things
B003G4W49C|5.0|I bought this book to see if the movie would be worth seeing, and now I can't wait to see it!  I was engaged throughout.  The introduction is not something I usually read, but I did this time. It really set the stage for what I was about to experience as well as address how others had experienced it, especially soldiers and gifted children.  Loved it!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case! tested it out and works perfectly! can't be more happy with my purchase of a life proof!
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I have heard so many people talking about Downton Abbey that my curiosity got the better of me.  I decided to find out for myself.  I have watched the First Season and I must admit it is addictive.
B00EY8B8JG|5.0|I love that they are coming out with a marvel TV show. I will never get enough of it. This will be the best show out there. I am going to watch every show that comes out. I wish they thought of this sooner. I would love to see the avengers every day.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|So realistic and fun! If you can't have a horse, this is a great option! From feeding and grooming to racing and training, this is sure to satisfy your horse care craving! I definitely recommend this game to everyone. And with Amazon's  awesomely cheap price, it's so easy to play. I will definitely continue playing this game, and I hope you do to!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really enjoying this game, very addictive just wish it didn't take so long to recharge energy as could run expensive buying credits on a free game
B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy the puzzles there is a HUGE variety, however I'm giving it 3 stars because you don't get all the pieces at once u drag them onto your board one by one, I don't like that but everything else awesome!
B00064VR0W|4.0|I grew up with rod stewart hot legs and all of that good stuff long live Rock n Roll thanks
0439023513|4.0|I found Mockingjay to be a difficult bird (pun intended). It is very different than the other two books in the series. The enemies are more abundant and less obvious, and Katniss has a serious struggle on her hands for mental health, let alone freedom from oppression. She has seen so much by the time Mockingjay begins, that she really finds it hard to cope... and the bodies certainly pile up in this, the final installment of the trilogy.<br /><br />In the end, I felt like Katniss was trapped between a rock (President Snow) and a hard place (President Coin) and her solution was probably the only thing she could have done. Details got a little vague and drawn out after the crescendo moment, and it all felt a little anticlimactic... I was left wondering how life could go on normally, given what happened, and I think it would have felt like that to Katniss too. Brilliant but brutal.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great characters, well written.  An author to be reckoned with! I look forward with anticipation to Mr. Howey's future<br />works.
B008359JXI|5.0|Madmen is a very masculine show. it is great to drink a whiskey while watching it. I've watched the whole series twice now.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thought this might turn out to be a little child game, but it's not. I'm surprised how busy I am cleaning, testing and trading my horse! So far, I like it!
B001A5HBJC|5.0|Madmen is where it is at. Perfect show to drink whiskey to and enjoy the awesomeness of being a man.
B002M87W9K|5.0|What a great musical and what a great cast!  I love it so much I had to buy a DVD of a 50 year old movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book started off little slow but grew into a page turner. I could not put it down. Great job!!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Great for quick checks for battery life for on the go.  Let's you know if you've got enough power to get you through a couple of hours away from a charge source.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is the best. Glad to be able to watch on Amazon Prime since we no longer have Direct TV and cannot pick up local stations.  Awaiting the next.
B007V65R54|4.0|#NateSilver A very nice job of explaining why we should be open to learning from our mistakes.  If you're working with #data must read.
0743270754|5.0|Simply put this is an exceptional work. So much time has been spent on focusing on Lincoln and presenting him in so many different facets that Team of Rivals presents him as a canny political operator who guided the country through its greatest crisis but who did it by making some of his greatest opponents colleagues if not outright supporters.  We all know how Lincoln surprised everyone to win the nomination and the election but very little is said how he was a canny politician in his own right.  Goodwin does an outstanding job of how Lincoln not only out maneuvered his opponents but that he managed to turn these opponents, each of whom thought themselves to be the truly best candidate for his job, into not only allies but devoted followers.<br /><br />This is probably the best book written about Lincoln and the Civil War since James McPherson's The Battle Cry of Freedom. True lovers of American History will make time to read this book.  You will not be sorry that you did!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show. What is most amazing is how much drama and family intrigue is packed into each episode. One episode is comparable to 3 or 4 of other shows, not a minute wasted. Acting all around is superb- but as always, Maggie Smith is my favorite! Don't miss this fantastic program.
B00011KHTM|5.0|This device helped me hook up my computer to a second screen. It also will let me hook up to a projector.
B007IK44CK|1.0|Way too predictable. For this budget they could have hired better script writers. You can't just go on special effects and Tom Cruise charisma.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I needed a note taking app. Did not want to mess w/ 's office. I find it relatively easy to use. This is my first device &amp; just learning to synch w/ desktop &amp; laptop.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|I love this movie! It's definitely a must-see for all children! It reminds me of all the silly little things that used to frighten me as a child!
B00E97AZZK|5.0|I personally enjoyed watching this movie... it was fun and entertaining to watch.  One of the reviews states that it leaves you with more questions than answers.  I'm not sure that is entirely true... Morgan Freeman pulls it together at the end.  As long as you aren't looking for the real magic, then it should be fun for you as well.  Great movie to watch with the wife and older children.
1451696191|5.0|yes i would recommend this product. it was such a good book to read. never was able to put it down!!!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|\\"Janeites\\" (those who practice \\"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her\\") have criticized this version of \\"Emma\\" because it doesn't match their idealized version of the manners and mannerisms of an 18th century young lady; the screen play doesn't exactly match the sequence of scenes in the book, etc.<br /><br />However, I am NOT a Janeite, and as with any cinematic interpretation of a beloved novel, I appreciate the art and creativity that goes into bringing the printed word into the multi-dimensional world of the movie screen. Romola Garai, Jonny Lee Miller, and Michael Gambon are wonderfully cast as Emma, Mr. Woodhouse and Mr. Knightley. Though Romola plays a rather more modern version of Emma with her perky, chatty and meddling ways, she is nonetheless delightful and lovable in spite of her character's matchmaking flaws.<br /><br />The costumes are bright and vivid, more so than other vintage interpretations of Austen; the sets in the manor houses and inns of the nearby town are well decorated and handsome with period detail, and the music adds a subtle but memorable punctuation to so many of the scenes. The outdoor scenes are simply stunning, offering a glimpse of the gorgeous grounds of the stately manor homes during all seasons.<br /><br />The many scenes between Emma and Mr. Knightley are well acted, and it is entertaining and fun to watch their relationship develop. This is a first class production, one that perhaps even Ms. Austen herself would be pleased to see brought to the screen - if she had even been able to imagine such a thing !
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Yes it was I expected. What I ordered and it was on time.  Great service. Have no more to say.
1452110581|5.0|I am, admittedly, a cat person. I love all animals, but happen to have cats. My family & I took turns reading some of these poems out loud to each other and could not stop laughing. Any cat owner can relate to these poems ... highly recommend this book!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|this was a great story, informative and well written, I really enjoyed it! I would recommend it to anyone, it's a good read.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|We loved it! It is a great movie for the whole family! It is a great buy for all! Go get it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game only thing is it takes forever for a cool update like a tnt update on creative mode would be awesome but over all the game is awesome.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really fun. I can spend hours playing. The difficulty of the levels is just perfect. I love it !!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I every part of it, I would recommend this book to everyone. I love a Nicholas Sparks book.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I have never, not ever, watched a series before.  I don't own a television.  My computer tudor told me about The Good Wife and i watched one and I am sold.  I watch one a night unless I absolutely have no time.  The acting and writing and context of the series is first rate.  I am a personal historian and the stories of the characters holds me.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Arrived fast and was as advertised.  Case containing the discs I very nice.  I  loved this series and still miss it.
6304698690|5.0|My niece and I read the book.  The story is so compelling and this DVD did justice in bringing it to life.  I have seen several versions of The Secret Garden and this production is by far my favorite.
1452110581|5.0|This is a wonderful book of poetry.  The author absolutely, unequivocally knows cats.  He captures the tone, the disposition, the action plan... the essence of the cat.  Anyone who owns a cat will get the biggest kick out of this book.... well worth giving as a gift for young and old.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I cannot stop playing this game! Its is fun yet slightly challenging. It allows you to think but not spend 5 days on one level. It has just the right amount of difficulty. There is a vast number of levels and level types, such as wooden coasters and metal coasters, and a few powerups as well. plenty of fun, cute characters  to choose from. All -in -all a fun, addicting, challenging game to play for hours on end.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|What an interesting insight to the political scene going on in the days of Lincoln. I didn't realize that Lincoln was not the only one who thought slavery should be abolished.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book popped into my suggestion box several times & I ignored it for months. I'm not sure what I was thinking! Great book, love the characters, love the story & totally worth the reading!
B0012GTZC0|1.0|Wanted the book t was not what I wanted at all. I should think enough was said about the book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|every effective, but just wastes a lot of battery. its easy to figure out and works even without internet. love it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|My boys love this app and check it every morning before school to know what to wear. I like it to check the weather in our favorite places and the necessary check for humidity to know how much water to pack.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I'd like to think this is a true story and if it is, it's a great insight.  If not, I still enjoyed the story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have enjoyed this game for quite some time. No stress or frustration. The game seems to scale well with the newer larger phones. I highly recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We've been binge watching this and are now half-way through season 2. Every time we finish, we think,&#34;Just one more...&#34;
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a fun and easy game every one should play this I can play for hours I can't Waite for the next level
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Does it need an explanation? Doesn't everyone love Kill Bill..? As per the norm, the first is better than the sequel, but it can't hurt to own both. =P
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|It's not action pack, but there's something about it that keeps pulling me back. I always like shows set back in a different era that depicts how it used to be and the conflicts that went on in that time.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Very gripping book, hard to put down. I felt like I was reading something that took place during the great depression, not the 90s and 2000s, but it did. It's crazy to think these things are currently happening in north Korea, it's really disturbing. We shouldn't be so blind to it anymore.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Zero stars if I could. I got about halfway through this book based only on insomnia and a desperate desire to distract myself for an hour or so. The author has obviously never heard of a semicolon; it's lack is apparent throughout this book. There are so many bad \\"AHA!\\" sentences in the first fifty pages that I'm embarrassed for the author AND their 8th grade Language Arts teacher. Please, please people--read good writing. Then when you read bad writing you will know--and write an honest review of it. This book is poorly-written, the story is absurd and inconsistent, and I can't believe people actually wrote positive reviews.<br />Don't. Waste. Your. Money.
B009AY04A8|3.0|As someone commented...there is soooooo much talking, it's such a distraction....once you get past that it's not too bad or eventful but since it was free it was worth the price
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great intense and exciting book.  This is a must read  I cannot wait and see what the second book brings
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved the book! It is exciting to know the meaning of all the flowers in my garden. The book is an easy read and insightful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 continues to demonstrate the quality of this production. The writing acting and staging are all superb and the story lines are riveting. Can't wait for Season 4!
B003VXMMTK|1.0|The version will Justine Waddel is wayyyyy better. This girl just sucked, bad actress, and Eddie Redmayne made a terrible angel..
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie gives a face to those who lived, died and lost.  Naomi watts deserved an award. So amazing. My soul ached for those who suffered through this disaster.  THIS is how a disaster movie should be made. Highlights the human loss and pain yet offers hope to some. My chest is still tight. So good.
B007RTAR64|5.0|She was just what I thought I would get she was beautiful. I have bought the 3 bella swan dolls from Amazon and I love them all. I would highly recommend to anyone to order one. They do come with their own individual stand. Prices are great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game and think it's fun and challenging. The best part is how you can beat friends. Get this game as soon as possible.
B00979CS50|4.0|This is a tough album to get around, as you have 2 discs, with few songs on each, but some songs are OVERlong and overkill: let me warn you that the 1st song Drifting Back is close to 30min. Now right from the start I found that very unappealing and discouraging. Who on his right mind would put such a long song as a first track?<br /><br />however, if you survive the first song and take the time to listen to the other tracks, you 'll be rewarded, as overall you will find quality.<br /><br />My personal favorite is by far Ramada Inn, which is a tragico-grungy song about an older couple struggling with finding something meaningful at their stage of their life, after having raised their children, who now moved on, etc. Beautiful lyric and reaching this trance-like moments that only Neil Young can achieve.<br /><br />Below my favorites of the album:<br /><br />3. Ramada Inn<br />4. Born In Ontario<br />2. She's Always Dancing<br />4. Walk Like A Giant<br />5. Psychedelic Pill (Alternate Mix)
B007N8RULO|5.0|this app is a good one for this game. ive used others and I prefer this one. give it a try.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|I guess I'm used to his early stuff, but to my calloused ears this is nothing like his 90's oeuvre. Sometimes the drum sounds like a typewriter and the music reminds me of some new-agey hip hop! I just wished I hadn't sprung for the Deluxe version at Best Buy. $8 bucks for three songs and a booklet??!! I like the new North Mississippi All-Stars a whole helluva lot better!
B00BESM14U|4.0|I've read only bits and pieces of the book, and I'm not really one for movies anymore (prefer tv shows). But this one was worth the price. The story line stayed fairly close to the book, and even managed to get that twist ending everybody wants from movies.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A fantastic fantastical tale. I found this title on accident with no expectations, having never heard of it, nor the author, prior to immersing myself in the circus. Well written and ... Magical. Enjoy!
B000059H98|5.0|Incredible speed in filling order and delivery. Bought this in Very Good condition, which turned out to be an understatement. Try open and never used, based on appearances. Extremely satisfied with purchase and of course, I love the movie, that's why I bought it!
B001ANYDAO|4.0|The book is very interesting and provides an entirely new perspective on the idea of success. I feel Gladwell stretches a bit too much at some points, but is an overall good read and would recommend it to anyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed his writing style, his humor and the idea of the book.  I wonder what I would do if faced with a similar situation.  Or what if that happened to friends of ours?  It was fun to read and thought provoking.  Read it for book club and recommend it to anyone.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Overall good book. Entertaining, but not awesome. I wouldn't read it again, but for the first read it was good.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Perfect mixture of suspense, thrilling and humor! Have been watching Supernatural since day one and it never ceases to complete entertain me! Love it!
B009POCG5Y|5.0|It was better than I thought it would be given the story line. You can always depend on Clint Eastwood for an interesting movie.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It's a fun game. The graphics are great. It is definitely worth the money. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Angry Birds.
B001NA6096|2.0|Chose the movie because of the publicity around Before Midnight. This was so slow in getting to the point, I fell asleep two or three times. Never seemed to take off.  Most of the time it was the two of them sitting in front of the camera and reading their lines while the other one reacted to the words.Hope the other two have a little more lively acting.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This movie is a good follow up to Andrew Lloyd Weber's, The Phantom of the Opera. A bit dark, but beautifully performed.
0307592731|4.0|Read this book because my son was going to go on the PCT. I wanted to know what he was going to be up against and if I needed to be concerned for his safety. Found out the trail is fun and a challenge, but not that bad.  My son started in April 2013 and yes, everyone has a trail name. No one goes by their real name.Adds to the fun of traveling. He did run up against two bears. But no problems. A hand held device call a Spot helps track his progress and lets us know where he is located on a Google map. He did have some problems with forest fires which the Forest Service routed them around. Says he would do it again!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's got an odd juxtaposition of space travel yet still using handguns?  Still, its a great way to wind down after a long day working!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The dynamic between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Joan Watson was a surprise. I was concerned the gender switch of Dr. Watson was being done just for the sake of novelty, but Lucy Liu brings a very good balance to the role. Her take on Dr. Watson blends admiration for Sherlock's talents with repudiation of his lack of tact and regard for others.<br /><br />This version of Sherlock Holmes is also distinctive from other incarnations beyond simply the change of locale to New York city.  Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of Holmes is fresh and compelling. He manages to bring a quiet intensity to the portrayal while still capturing Holmes' penchant for tantrums. 'Sherlock', the BBC version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective, stars Benedict Cumberbatch (notable for his work in Star Trek: Into Darkness) as a Sherlock Holmes who is, by his own admission, a high functioning sociopath. Miller's Holmes is driven not only by his need to solve puzzles/homicides, but by his desire to see justice served. Miller judiciously lets Holmes facade of confidence and imperiousness slip just enough to give us glimpses of the character's vulnerability. He allows just enough of a peek behind the curtain so we can see the regard he holds for Watson while not devolving into a sentimentality that would rob the character of all credibility. Thank God it was renewed for a 2nd season.
B0013YPEMG|5.0|I bought this movie to add to my Amazon video library.  I have seen this movie several times, yet never owned it on DVD. My kids love the Batman cartoons, so I figuered why not let them see a good &#34;movie&#34; version of the comic series.  They keep saying to play it over and over and over..........<br /><br />&#34;This town needs and enima&#34; is probably one of the best lines in the movie, followed by &#34;Oh, we have a live on here....&#34;  Jack Nicholson hands down plays the best bad guy in the movie!  A wise investment... a must buy!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My Horse is a family friendly game that is fun for all and we want to know when the mystery competition section will become available within the game.  It has been great fun.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|My best friend says this movie has the best movie kiss of all time in it! I can't get enough oft this movie. It is funny, great message, clean, and heart warming!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Very cute movie. We love it and enjoyed it a lot. My daughter was very happy with it and watched 3 times the first day.
B003L77G06|5.0|This show makes me laugh out loud. Seriously. And not many shows do. I love that it shows so many different kinds of families but doesn't leave out the nuclear family.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|You do not need to be familiar with the original Star Trek series or movies to enjoy this!  If you are familiar with the original series and movies, you will still enjoy the new timeline!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Enjoyed the progression of the story line.  Great characters.  Very well acted and written.  Action packed fast paced.  Not for young children.
B0064W6728|4.0|After reading the previous issue I was pleasantly surprised that this one got the series back on track.  It's dealing with the issues that ended in Fables 12 and does a very good job of ignoring what happened in Fables 13.
B00BSZZA3I|3.0|Its a nice looking case but it lacks great protection. I dropped my phone once already and there is a scratch on the bottom right corner of the device. Love the stand feature and would recommend this product but if you want more protection i would recommend the otter box. I own both and love each one differently.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I never knew that this went on with our Orphans back then.  It is not something that we should be proud of, but you have to realize that they were solving a problem giving them a home in a new country when they had none and giving the adopted parent the help they needed.  I am just unhappy that the adopted parents were mostly not good people.
B000I9WW3G|5.0|GREAT STORY OF DETERMINATION AND STRUGLE OF A SINGLE MOM WHO TAKES ON THE CHALANGE OF CORP AMERICAN AND WINS THE BATTLE
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great Story, Very Funny, Creative, Cute, Spooky, but not too scary, my daughter have been watching it over and over.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Great product, very slim, great build quality. Works with all current generation phones that supports MHL 2.0. Used it with Nexus 4.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I think this is a fantastic book! It is, of course, a philosophical book, so it requires a person to warm the little grey cells up with a few Negra Modelos first, but it is very well-written. Nassim's sense of humor is very unique and fresh and entertaining. He has given me lots 'n' lots to think about, and has really put a new dent in my slant on reality and how things really work. I think his premiss is as true as a one can be, when describing how modern, world-wide screwed up culture, economy, government, military, etc. really work, and how to handle things. Given his background, there is no doubt that he writes from both hard experience, and a lot of thought about &#34;chance&#34; and &#34;odds&#34; and such often - unrecognizeable inputs in what happens to us vis-a-vis all the bird-brained advice we get from talking TV heads that lead to unnecessary harm and ruin. I'm going to go back and get Nassim's other books and study them, too! Gives me a chance to catch up on the latest breweries out there, too!
1439175640|5.0|I really liked the book. It has a better aspect than I thought it would have, I thought it would be smaller and the pages would be thinner. Just waiting to try the recipes!
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|It's only in the narrow context of these events that Dells`moralizing offers any revelance.The author may just as well have said it is what it is and saved the reader a lot of palaver.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had been hearing good things about it for the first two seasons and then I finally started watching it myself.  I was sucked in immediately.  I am now part way into season two and can't wait to see more!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Do not rent this movie. Buy it. You will want to watch it over and over again. Five doughnut rating. (doughnuts, doughnuts, doughnuts, doughnuts, doughnuts)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Rarely will you find a book where the second or third book is better than the first.  This series definitely gets better the more you read!  :)
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I have seen The Matrix several times. I think that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is definitely the movies which could best explain our times. If you still believe that the system you are in is real, you are completely out of your mind. Nothing about this system has lived up to its advertising and I am glad that more people are waking up. The Matrix explains the sleep that you have been in as well as any movie that I have seen and I have seen a lot of movies. The Matrix also lets you know why those in power keep you in a sleep state. Waking up can be scary for many of you, but The Matrix makes you feel good about waking up. If you were to watch The Matrix and exercise some courage, you may not reach for anti-depressants to get through each of your days. Even if you do not want to wake up the earth is awake and will not let you sleep any longer. Watch The Matrix and come out here with the rest of us who are awake already.
B0015DROBO|4.0|A little slow, but all of the details are necessary for the later books.  If you don't plan to read them all, don't bother reading this one.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|When I sat down to watch Ted I did not expect much at all. I had seen Family Guy and figured that I would get a lot of outrageous jokes and clever references. Ted did give me all that Family Guy used to, but it also gave a lesson that is important to us. Many of us are locked into an endless state of childhood. Some people are locked in because of a traumatic experience. Other people are locked into childhood because everyone in their inner circle is locked into childhood. The main character in Ted never really comes out of his childhood, even when he loses the love of his life. The woman who loves the main character allows him to stay in a state of childhood because she sees the pain it will cause. I come across so many people that think they are adults, but are old children. I have seen elderly people who are still in a state of childhood. Watch Ted by Seth MacFarlane and see if it reminds you of anyone.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is fun and enjoyable. With a bit of patience you don't need any in-app purchases. A very good game for free.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I started to read it, wasn't interested, and decided to return it. It could be better for teens, I just didn't find it interesting.
1401923127|5.0|LOved it, I felt it was well worth the price. Well written. Excellent reading material. Would definately recommend it! Thanks
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Loved this book. I loved that it was from the male point of view. Really funny, and easy to read.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|proof that &#34;different is not less&#34;  an amazing story of courage, persistence, and tenacity.  This needs to be watched by all people of all ages, and backgrounds.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This entire drama is just wonderful. The scenery, the costumes as well as the actors is fabulous. It leaves you wishing it would not end so soon every episode. Maggie Smith is hilarious.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Great app,<br />Easy interface and use....<br />Would recommend to anyone who is looking to side-load or download any apps.<br />Great way to organize for your mobile needs.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|An interesting combination of characters. Captain Jack Harkness keeps everyone wondering- gay or straight or bi. Any way about it the man is a super talent. I hope this will continue to be produced though I hear it is on hiatus at present.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Ariana has a magnificent voice that is far beyond the girls who are out here putting out music. She has a wide octave range and isn't shy about it!<br /><br />The album is like 1997's Honey on steroids! There's a hip-hop flair but the vocals are right in your face! This girl has the makings of a legend and I am extremely thankful that she didn't use her voice for some generic bubblegum pop song! Thank you, Ariana!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book led me into the world of cancer patients and I am so glad I read it. Green is a literary genius and has a way of inspiring me through his writing. I will forever remember this book.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Was looking for a book to read, knowing that I'd be in flight for over 20 hours. While I did sleep for more than half the flight, I was thoroughly entertained on the other half by this book. It's a perfect book for those looking for a fun read that won't require a huge mental investment. Gaiman is a talented writer, and I enjoyed taking a literary journey with him while on a long journey of my own.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I have played this game as a board game and loved it.  It took me awhile to figure how it works.  I just barely figured out how you know how many pieces are left and which ones.  I love how it keeps track of points.  Fun game even for an adult.
B00C9G22R2|1.0|Grandmaster is a poor excuse for a documentary. The movie scenes jump from one<br />place to another with no smooth flow. The entire movie is dark and most of the<br />fighting occurs indoors with poor lighting, or outdoors at night in the rain.<br />So you don't really get a clear idea of the moves they are using.<br />Most of the time the characters are communicating to each other by using<br />Chinese proverbs. So you sit there trying to figure out what the proverb means,<br />while missing the responding proverb. Very frustrating to watch. What makes<br />the movie even worse is that it's boring! I walk out of the movie. 0-stars!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|another great book by Grisham. Easy read and a page turner. Nothing is as it seems in this latest novel
1449437524|5.0|Every pet owner will probably love this.  It's a small book, but inexpensive.  Nice quality.  And of course very clever and funny.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Humor,action romance, everything a man needs in a book (or a woman).if you like Greek and Roman God stuff you will love this series and this book.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|This game is different than other hog I have played. Story is easy to follow, great scenes and variety of puzzle games included. One complaint, I was pretty far into the game and it froze, had to remove and reinstall and it started me back at the beginning, I have not made it back to that spot so I hope it doesn't freeze again.  Once in a while it flashes back to menu screen but after hitting play I am back where I was.
1592400876|2.0|I don't know why this book sold so well in America. It's not like we have a shortage of grammarian authors--we have Grammar Girl! And it's not like the author even professes to be a grammarian (she was kidding about not knowing what a subordinate clause was, right?). From reading this book, I believe the author had a personal vendetta against all misplaced apostrophes. So, she set off to Oxford Library and wrote a book about it.<br /><br />Get this: she wrote over 200 pages about punctuation. That's it. No nouns, verbs, or even interjections. Just commas, apostrophes, and dashes. When you write over 200 pages about punctuation, guess what happens? You begin to sound contradictory and preachy.  I'm willing to bet most of the Americans bought this book because of the cute story about pandas shooting one another. Then they never finished reading it (a 35 page introduction is a little obnoxious). Or, if they did read it, they stared at Amazon's page in consternation, too afraid to leave a review.<br /><br />You have to have some serious balls (male or female) to write a book about grammar. And, people that leave reviews for grammar books need some serious kahunas as well--\\"look at me, I learns grammar good\\". People judge. But I'm the type of guy that is willing to walk into a conference of grammarites and yell, \\"wazzup, catz!\\" You have to live a little.<br /><br />That's what the author missed: you have to live a little. Most grammar books I read talk about the differences of opinion. Newspapers and Book Publishers have their own style guides (AP Style Guide and Chicago Manual of Style, among others) and they differ. They'll say \\"the `80s\\", \\"the 80's\\", or \\"the eighties\\", and they're all correct. But not according to the author. It's either her way, or else. And that's wrong. English is a living language and should be enjoyed by all who strive to learn it. So let's put away our wrist-slapping rulers and get along, okay?<br /><br />For some interesting, yet twisted fun, read Louis Menand's critique of `Eats, Shoots & Leaves' in `The New Yorker'. He points out some debatable errors found in this book on punctuation. But that's just fighting meanie with meanie, isn't it?<br /><br />I'm giving this book a few stars for getting Americans to read about grammar and punctuation (yay!), but taking many stars away for scaring the em-dashes out of them (boo!).
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love animals and I like this game so far, I just don't like waiting so long for some things
B003G4W49C|4.0|Excellent, thought-provoking, slightly disturbing at times but a book that doesn't let you go easily. Gets you thinking about our human psychology.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This book was such a fun read.  I loved the story and had a hard time putting the book down.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Being in the Philippines, I have to admit that there are some challenges (\\"Discrimination!!!\\" I say!) to owning this product because the Chromecast app isn't readily available outside the US. Fortunately for Android, the APK exists somewhere in the clouds. For iOS, however, sorry you're not as fortunate.<br /><br />But once it's all set up, you get a great YouTube streaming player. That's practically the only thing it can do outside the US but, given its low price, that's actually good enough. Fun times to be had by all as you toss video links at the device for playback on a big screen. This is a great thing to have during social occasions, thereby giving the phrase 'social networking' an added dimension.<br /><br />More thoughts over at [...]
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Good clean TV for the entire family.  No curse words or nudity.  There are only 4 seasons.  That is too bad.
B000001F2X|4.0|I had never been a fan of J J Cale since he was always too laid back for my rocker tastes. I had only owned Road To Escondido with Eric Clapton when I heard the news of J J's death. So I ordered Naturally and Troubador, his first and fourth releases. Now older and more laid back, I could really appreciate it. With his very soft voice, he gives his music the feel of being loaded while still having the chops. The only other group that can pull this off is The Band. Just listening to J J Cale or The Band can almost make one feel like they are loaded. J J's lyrics are also predominantly obsessed with sex, which is another good thing.<br /><br />After ripping my Naturally and Troubador in their entirety to my iPod for the car, I ordered this one, his fifth release, as well as Really and Okie, his second and third releases. These five completed my seventies studio releases from the man. Then after listening to all 60 songs over and over (12 songs from each release), I decided that some of them had to be deleted from the iPod. This one had 10 keepers, while the first four releases had 7 or 8 keepers each. Yes, those releases had most of his famous songs, but they also had more of what I felt was filler.<br /><br />After reading about him further, he had Eric Clapton to thank for all those checks arriving in the mail. Eric always wanted to sound like J J, but could never quite pull it off. Eric's versions of After Midnight and Cocaine are much more rocking than J J's, but check out both versions of I'll Make Love To You Anytime. J J's version easily wins. Also, after listening to plenty of J J, one can see where the inspirational style of Eric's Promises came from.<br /><br />I'm glad that I bought all five of his seventies releases instead of a compilation. Better late than never. There was only one J J Cale. May he rest in peace.
B0000041XX|4.0|great voices.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Anyone with any contact with board gaming culture has heard, by now, that we are in the midst of a Golden Age of board games.  You may have heard this second-hand by now, or even via a New York Times style piece.  And if you've heard that, you've also probably heard that this game is where the renaissance started.  All this is basically true.<br /><br />Despite it's towering role in the recent history of the hobby, among serious gamers, it's fashionable to proclaim Settlers of Catan to be overrated, or a fun but shallow offering.  Also, among American gamers, there is a rising contempt for the occasionally anodyne themes of Eurogames, and Settlers is practically synonymous with the style.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I feel that all these criticisms are misguided, and Settlers of Catan is a once-a-generation classic for a reason.  For a number of reasons, actually, which I will outline for you here:<br /><br />1. Balance<br /><br />Settlers of Catan is shockingly balanced for a game that relies so heavily on dice.  The secret sauce of Catan - and this is going to come up again - is the social dimension.  In any game of four players, the ability to gang up on a leader ends up flattening out a lot of the randomness.<br /><br />By the way, and this is a quick aside, Settlers of Catan should be played with four players.  Fewer players throws off the balance and flow a little, and two is barely tenable.  I've played with five and six players via the expansion, and it does as good a job as it could, but the truth is that four-player Catan is the way to go.<br /><br />2. Accessibility<br /><br />Part of the appeal of Eurogames is that they are designed for a more family-oriented market.  Settlers of Catan has extremely simple rules that can be explained to a child, or a tipsy uncle.  There are no adult or controversial themes that could alienate any audience I can think of (dice haters?).  Nobody is eliminated, and the balancing that comes with the social dimension can keep the race interesting until the final turn.  Games are of a manageable length, and they don't interfere with more casual conversations between players and non-players.<br /><br />3. Depth<br /><br />I flatly disagree that Settlers is a shallow game.  It is true that it's simple, but complexity and depth are not the same things at all.  Despite this great simplicity, there are several different paths to winning the game, with a variety of overlapping strategies.  Play benefits from careful planning, but requires constant adaptation.  And again, the social element adds as many layers as you and your fellow players bring to the game.<br /><br />4. Fun<br /><br />I've had a hard time finding a game that provokes the same kind of experience in players, hardcore or casual, young or old, whatever.  The fact that it remains a horse race till the end, and so much of the game is trading and interacting, keeps it totally engaging for the duration.  It succeeds at the rare accomplishment of actually facilitating human interaction between players.  Very few of even the most lauded games in the hobby are able to promote the same kind of fun socializing, unless we're talking about actual party games (a genre which is probably underrated by many serious gamers, anyway).<br /><br />All that being said...<br /><br />Put together, these are the ingredients of a true classic.  You could play it with parents and children at Thanksgiving, in a college dorm room, in the lunchroom in the right kind of corporate environment...to be honest, I've seen it played in all these places and more.  You can learn it as a child and still enjoy it as an adult.  It's balanced, nuanced, and painstakingly designed to be fun for everyone in the universe.  It's a goddamn work of art, so bow down to Settlers of Catan!<br /><br />As for the rest of the usual stuff: attractive, durable and simple components.  Very Euro.  It can be tricky to get everything back in the tray after unboxing, but when isn't it?  The rules could be organized a little better, but if you look for it, you can derive an unambiguous ruling for pretty much whatever happens.  Only once did we have to resolve a debate by consulting the online consensus (I forget what it was about, but I think I was wrong).<br /><br />Any game collection is incomplete with it.  For casual gamers, it should be a go-to for board game situations.  For more devoted hobbyists, it simply needs to be studied and appreciated, and dusted off when you need to remember how good it is.  It's the closest thing we've seen to chess in quite some time (I'm going to avoid hyperbole by refraining from specifying a time period, here).
B008XG1X18|2.0|Not sure what happened but I cannot pin items to my boards. When I attempt to pin to a board it asks me to select a board, then returns an error message indicating the application must close. Fix this issue and I will be very happy.
B0037B6QSY|4.0|Although I found this book to be very enlightening, I would suggest reading his other book Full Catastrophe Living first. It gives a better background in mindfulness.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|This is OK, I mean I like it but didn't draw me in.  After watching the first season I got bored.  You be the judge.
B006QKJQ12|5.0|I love the movies as well as the series. This does a great job of explaining Po's childhood and where he came from. It does have quite the cliffhanger and I hope there is a 3rd movie to further the story along!
B003HARV98|5.0|This album is in a category of its own. This album is when Marina was pulling away and breaking out from mainstream pop and creating meaningful and unflawed alternative tracks. It's refreshing to listen to because it is so different in it's own beautiful way. BUY IT!!
B00DYFCYSO|2.0|if you like Over dosing on star bucks Coffee than John Legend is your dude, if you want some growth and seperation from your peer group and going out on a limb and making a statement, well he ain't for you.  bottom line his voice for me is either take it  or leave it.  it has its place, however not memorable on a whole.  musically  he is trying to be hip instead  of doing something that is truly him. to me he could be the modern day  Bobby Short  with something else thrown in if he had that next gear.  too many samples and short cuts to trying to make an accesible cool album as to ripping them keys and  making something memorable.  he is a safe act which has its place, however for the most part he is the King of Being Bland. if he took his voice and a had a rock sound behind it or something with some kick it might give him a different vibe, as it stands, he is so predictable you can know every detail in a deep sleep.production, the music and for the record he didn't do nothing for Bobby Caldwell with that overused cover. Caldwell made a statement back in the day, i would think John legend might take a cue?
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Buying this album was probably the best decision that I have made this entire year. Ellie Goulding's EDM house pop is beyond incredible. I kid you not when I say that every single track on Halcyon Days is absolutely flawless. It's a sin not to buy this album.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great show. We own all the seasons and love the fact that the writer shows no mercy to the characters. Any of them can die at any time! Keeps you wanting more!

B0035JRUZQ|5.0|John Wayne is a &#34;real&#34; character actor. Glad he left us so many good flicks :)<br />Enjoy this classic movie.
B00EY8LK2Q|1.0|Just like the other reviewers, I want to know where is episode 3! How can you say buy the season and don't include episode 3? I originally bought a season pass when the season 3 option appeared on amazon then I looked at my account and noticed they were charging me 94 cent for the behind the scene extras and the season pass was no longer an option. WTF! Is this some kind of Jedi mine trick! I think amazon owes all of the die hard Spartacus fans who purchased a season pass, a 5 dollar credit and episode 3 for our troubles! I still love Spartacus! Good thing I purchased the Blu-ray too! GIVE ME MY EPISODE 3!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is very fun and creative building and nothing can beat it. But they could add a little bit more
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great price on Amazon too.  My sons just got into Star Wars and the movies are never on TV so we have decided to get this set from Amazon.com.  We are very happy with the speed of delivery and the quality of the DVDs.
B000P0J0AQ|3.0|I've watched this one and the second, but I'm not sure I'll even bother with the third. The premise isn't bad but having Keanu Reeves flying around like Superman is a bit much. He's rather wooden for the part and I think they could have done a much better job with casting.  If you just want something to watch to fill an evening this is fine but I'd never recommend to anyone.
B007KLKFSO|4.0|Although I didn't finish this book feeling totally satisfied, it provided some insight into what is invariably a difficult period of everyone's life, even without the complications these protagonists faced.  Worth picking up.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a great little game to play my son loves to feed the dragons. He's three years old. Very colorful and cute.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great Product! Works as adverised and should only get better as it matures.  Things are so easy to buy on Amazon!

B00CF0ETBE|5.0|Wow! So much CSNY on 3 CD's. All of my old favorites and many new favorites that I HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE.<br />This anthology is great.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching Suits a few weeks ago and I love it!  The characters and story lines are strong and the mix drama with occasional comedic moments makes it fun.  I would highly recommend it!!
B006P96PAO|5.0|I have watched this movie five times now and I will never get tired of it.  This is one of the most moving movies that I have ever seen.  This is a great movie for the whole entire family!!!!!!!!  That is unusuall anymore.  Everyone needs to see this at least once, it will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  Very, very powerfull!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved this book. And that sorta surprised me. A friend recommended it to me and she just raved about it. She said how it was so good and that I'd laugh and that I'd cry ... I told her to stop there because I'm not all about crying when I read. I love a good story but I don't usually want tears to go along with it if I can help it. I asked her what it was about and she said \\"Well it's about these kids with cancer. But it's really funny!\\" To which I responded \\"That doesn't sound enjoyable at all!\\" Ok, so fast forward a couple of months and I decided to check it out anyway. I was drawn in right away because it was so well written. I just really enjoyed the dialogue of the characters. It WAS funny. Hazel's narration and thought process was funny. Augustus was written to be funny. So, yeah, it was funny. But cancer is involved so ultimately it has its sad moments, too. I didn't give this book the full five stars simply because I felt it ended too soon. I don't want to spoil for those who haven't read, so I'll just say at a certain point in the book it all seems to move ahead super fast and ends quickly. With the characters written well and the dialogue flowing the way it did, there was plenty of room to just let the story tell itself a little bit more. It's a fairly short book so adding some pages wouldn't have hurt it at all. I'd still highly recommend it though. You can knock it out in a couple of days. And then you can say you read the book when the movie hits next year. Oh and I'm not sure that it matters, but I actually just checked this book out at my local library. Then I purchased the Kindle edition for $3.99 (pretty fair price - it was $9 or so when my friend purchased it.)
B009WUBERW|4.0|Much better than the 1st good story and moved along the cameo's where great and a few good one liners action sequence was good
1609611543|5.0|I knew about our foods being genetically modified but when you read this book it really opens your eyes to the problems that arise from changing our foods. I think everyone should read this book. I watch my diet and I walk an hour every day and still I battle with my weight. I believe it has a lot to do with how our foods are being genetically modified. After reading this book I am changing how and what I eat even more. This book is a must read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Don't buy this expecting to beam video from notebook screen. It doesn't have the processing power (and never will) to transcode on the fly. Watch slideshows, yes. Bore people with PowerPoint, sure. But no video.<br /><br />I'll stick with my Roku for watching Netflix and the occasional YouTubing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Omg hot hot hot the whole trilogy captivated me.  I can not believe I waited so long to read this series.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|I love this game, one reason you are not playing against anyone,very relaxing.  It is a lot of fun, glad I got it. Amazon  has such wonderful apps.
076115678X|2.0|I am a curly girl and had read her earlier book which I liked better. This book pushed her new personal product line & also tried to breeze over other beauty fiels without success. Wish I had been able to locate her earlier edition.
B004EF6632|5.0|I love all things BBC, but nothing has ever come close to the absolutely beautiful and compelling North and South.  The entire film is gorgeous -- music, hero, plot, cinematography.  I only wish I could watch it again for the first time!
B007SGM084|5.0|BEST EVER SERIES KEPT UP MANY NIGHTS COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN<br />IT IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WAITING FOR MOVIE
B00B81B0HC|5.0|This is such a versatile group.  It's like three types of music in one CD. There are some groups that you know it is them no matter what song they sing.  This group changes things up and do a great job with all styles of songs on this CD. Would recommend.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd like it but once I tryed it I was hooked. I play it a couple times aday my granddaughter likes to play to
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downtime Abbey is a great series.  I love the costumes.  It's a look into a world so different from today.
B00ARF92HK|2.0|The original was better! I cant believe I fell for that remake! I want to see the new Total Recal just to compare it
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot, especially the ending. Feel free to recommend this to your friends and relatives! You will definitely enjoy it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I'm not a highly educated  individual. So this won't be a critical review, that's for critics. This book had me laughing, shaking my head in disbelief, and yes crying. I had to HIDE in the bathroom from my wife while I sobbed at the end. This man, his family, his brothers in arms are a inspiration, in all facets of their lives. I served in the Marines for almost 12 years as a 0311, and the Army National Guard as a 19k for 5. The dedication and professionalism of DevGru is awe inspiring. Inside of that is Adam Brown who sets the bar even higher. His faith and dedication to his family and his comrades will inspire me too be a better man for the remainder of my time. Will reread this book till then to keep me straight. SEMPER FIDELIS Adam Brown.
B000IZ6URY|2.0|Just wan't my style of comedy, since I am required more words for a review... I rate it a C-
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love this game. Has so much to it. Haven't even purchased the full game yet. Which I will. So much fun. Def worth the time to play.<br />Want to find more like this one.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|The movie was magnificent and the 3D presentation was terrific.  It felt as if I was there. The Cirque Du Soleil troop are fantastic.
B004LWZW24|5.0|This movie was exactly what I needed!  My family and I snuggled up and watched it together.  We jumped a lot and had a great movie night.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This would make a great kids movie, along the same lines as The Goonies years ago. I will read more of his.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was about a phenomenon I had never heard of. Why are these things swept under the carpet? Perhaps there were more happy endings. I sincerely hope so. Child slavery in this country!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Simple to use, haven't had any problems, just downloaded a 20min video and it was faster than I expected. Great choice for storing YouTube videos for offline watching!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A really funny book for any young readers who like a good laugh.must read awesome and funny book. See yahoo next time.

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I was extremely exited when I saw this game in the Appstore and purchased it immediately. Well done Game loft
0316017930|5.0|Great read, very interesting and compelling.  Gladwell does a great job of bringing concepts to life through examples that are relatable and make sense.  A great read!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is the best hair salon game out there! All others are cheap and worth junk! I recommend this hair salon app! I get so addicted and sit on the couch for hours!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I bought it on a lark, 'cause I'm a bit of a Bowie fan and I figured this might be the last new Bowie album ever. It's pretty damn good, with the exception of 'Dancing Out In Space' which just kind of sucked.<br /><br />The Next Day, I'd Rather Be High, and especially You Will Set The World On Fire are stand-out awesome songs, and overall I'd say this album kicks prodigious amounts of ass
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am a brony and I love love love the game a should by game. its not only for girls but guys still lots of fun if you like to watch or play my little pony you will love this app
B005LAII94|5.0|I've watched this movie 5 times over and it's NEVER BORING...keeps you coming back.  The movie is fast paced but the actors and actresses are TOTALLY AWESOME...twists and turns everywhere in this &#34;baby&#34;....ITS ONE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS...!!
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|The game is really fun for about 1 hour of playing.  Then it gets repetitive and then boring.  It is fun to play on a tablet 2 player though.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|Read this edition as the original has been temporarily unavailable for a long time. Love the story, should teach all of us about empathy. James deserves THE break. If a down and out drug addict finds it in his heart to help a little cat, we could all take a leaf of his book. Wish Bob AND his mate James all the breaks they need for a great life out of the rain.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love taking a peek in to this time period and seeing how the family and the supportive staff lived together to run Downton Abbey. The drama is, well, dramatic, but I love it. I'm always anticipating the next episode.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is fun you get to talk to people all over. You can win items. But it is too hard to complete a room to get more chips. Htg (hard to get) items everyone is after. You get the shadows but you get no numbers. I get mad and quit.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The trilogy is so good I could hardly put it down! I can't wait for the movie!  The book pulls you in and is a fantastic story that leaves you wondering if this could ever happen in real life.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|I miss Andy Whitfield. But the stories on the other Gladiators' climb to Championship was entertaining. I am eager to purchase the final season.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A JG novel unwinds in a specific fashion but The Litigators really spent time on character development and the &#34;intrigue&#34; didn't really get going until almost halfway through.  It was a nice change of pace...
B004W2UBYW|3.0|This book tells the story of Steve Jobs who was more of a legend than a man. While the book is not a waste of time, the movie is.<br />This is a complicated story about a complicated man and no movie could ever do it justice. The book however drags a bit from time to time but I think you plug along out of contempt for Jobs not for love of him.
B005G6QF8Y|5.0|Perfectionist is one of those rare, wonderful albums, where I love every song. I've listened to the entire album twenty times already. It's just pure, pop, perfection.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|First time reading it and I couldn't stop ! A great classic and an unpredictable romance book to read for someone .
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great game. A lot of fun. It's easy to play. Make you want to play more so you can play your friends on Facebook. Fun game to play and easy.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Wanted to like it but just couldn't watch. It. I like Karl Urban, but this movie was a major fail!
B001EA4M7M|4.0|Never tire of seeing Pride and Prejudice, and this was a good rendition.  I wasn't crazy about the male lead, but who can compare with Colin Firth?  I'll watch it again, I'm sure.
B009MYARIK|1.0|I've enjoyed this author's other books, but this one was awful.  I agree with other reviewers -- Even more predictable than her other titles, but with an annoying plot and annoying characters.  Don't waste your time.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Everyone was talking about it.. We missed it on TV so I bought all three seasons to catch up... I think it is ten star!!! Only thru season two so far.  I am afraid to finish it because I will miss it.  Buy it!!! It's great!!!!!!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Multiple stories linked together. Good book but no where close to the Kite Runner. Keeps you engrossed nonetheless. Enjoy reading.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I think I may be a bit prejudiced as I really enjoy reading everything Nicolas Sparks rights.  Throughly enjoyed this book
B0012QVJXS|5.0|my 5 year old wanted to learn about superman.  We didn't feel comfortable having him watch any of the newer movies because of the more graphic violence.  This was a perfrct solution.  Since it also provides the history of superman, he is now a superman expert!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is an excellent show. It kept me intrigued and I could hardly wait for the next episode. I would definitely recommend it.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle is funny, sad at times, cute and sometimes he has that child like demeanor. It is one show that brings all the emotions and fun together in one good show.
B003B02O7I|4.0|The story deals with human greed and the power of money. The humour is there. One of Grisham best novels.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|I guess you have to have an internet connection for it to work.  WHY????  Still looking for a free camera for my Kindle Fire HD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The early rooms teach the tricks and tips as they become more challenging. Looking forward to more content. Some of the puzzles required really creative thinking, while others were straight logic. A good mix.
B009ZFPQOQ|1.0|Apparently it doesn't work for Kindle Fire HD.  Such a huge disappointment.  After you put in the address, there is no where to go!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed this film for what it's worth. This a really recycle idea, but if you have a free Sunday it's good for background noise!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I started looking at gaming mice when my very old and out of date logitech mouse/keyboard/numpad usb stick crapped the bed. So I went on the internet and searched up on gaming mice, and of course logitech and razer were huge. but the prices were not for me, for what You get wasn't that grand imo. Until i found anker, i found it in a listing of cool mice, and googled some reviews. Most were positive and gave it a good review and the budget was just fine for me so i got it.<br /><br />It game a day earlier than it said it would have came which was awesome, in the box presentation of the mouse with the quote &#34;take your weapon&#34; made it awesome. Very simplistic to setup, plugged in and boom, all set. Got the driver off the site and it works great.<br /><br />gotta say that the value of this mouse i would say equals or even exceeds a few razer mice i've used. Its super comfortableand everything seems sturdy and ready to go.<br /><br />If you need an awesome mouse with bang for your buck, lay anker with this mouse.<br /><br />Anker,<br />Great job on this mouse, keep up the good work and hope to see more from you in the future
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I love this movie I seen it years ago couldn't remember the name i told my daughter about it she found me the movie I found it and bought it

B0097HSS4M|1.0|I purchased it with my Kindle fire and it will not display on my IPad.  It was supposed to do that through the cloud. All my pics are on my IPad.  I tried to purchase it again using my IPad but it states &#34;you have already purchased this app&#34;

B00B2TUKI0|5.0|The Blue Room by Madeleine Peyroux was given to me as a birthday gift.  It's been a great hit at my house. Although the songs are easily recognizable from works of other artists, her new and inventive way each song was sung was wonderful. Of course I have my favorites, but the whole album is a pleasure to listen to. I love the tone and quality of her voice, it reminds me of the great torch singers of the 50's, each with their own twist on a song. This album will be played often and will eventually make it's way into the car. This is listening pleasure at its finest. Sit back, see yourself in a place that relaxes you well, like a fireplace with a fire on a snowy night and just enjoy. It may be the blues, but it is sung so well, you won't mind. Enjoy.
B000002U88|5.0|Just got it today!!-9/4/13!! I love it!! Excellent!! Fantastic!! Great work!! I love Amazon & all it offers!!  I will do all my shopping here!! A++++++++ :o)
B004SUDQE0|5.0|I think everyone should watch this.  Great movie, great scenery and community spirit to be envied. A must watch I think.
B005VMSATA|3.0|I know he really tries, but all I can see when I watch him is Van Wilder.  I know you are a good man Ryan, and I've seen your newer stuff, it's noticeable to me at least that you are refining your art.
B00CATONCA|4.0|This is not a bad Special Edition, but not perfect, but I think it's worth the money ( I spent like 96 and change or something ). The aquariums are a little bigger than a blue ray season case in height and width, not inculding the marquee on the bottom that reads &#34;Walking Dead&#34;. The heads come individually wrapped and are around 3-4&#34; in height a piece, and they're placed in the aquariums. Then you actually fill them with water and snap the lids and put them back in the case. The &#34;3&#34; on the words &#34;season 3&#34; is the button to light it up. You need 4 triple A's that are not included. If you do put water in it, make sure you change it out so you don't get an algae build up, that's the only draw back. There's little plastic bits that you put in that are supposed to like deceased, necrotic tissue. Some float, some settle. The discs are in their own book that slide behind the aquarium. They are pretty much separate from the tanks except two holes, one behind either tank, so make sure you don't tip the display when the booklet is in (or in general). The LED lights are below each tank as seen in the picture. The booklet is pretty difficult to get out once you slide it back. I had to remove the tanks and use the holes to help me slide it out, but I did it without hurting the case. So aside from the &#34;high maintanance&#34; of the water, it's awesome, hence the 4 star. I'm a collector so I thought it was worth the extra dollar. It would've been nice to see that dollar go a little farther if they filled the tanks with some kind of clear permanent gelatin, or clear plastic or something.
B007AYJ3JI|1.0|this movie will not play in my DVD player. When you put the movie in it says WRONG REGION. I told the seller this and they still haven't done anything about it. Poor BUSINESS ETHIC!!! Will not shop with this person again. They have made no attempt to correct this in anyway
B00457X8BC|5.0|Full to twists and turns!  Like Wallendar, you don't know what's going on for a long time -- lots of suspense.
B007ZYJT1U|4.0|Serious topics covered: alcoholism, spousal abuse/rape, religion, death, redemption, etc.  There are several very violent segments.  Not for the faint of heart.  Gritty and authentic.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|What I like most about this app is that it notifies you when you are using high amounts of memory, so you can clean your running apps and you don't lose speed.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie. I read the book for school before the movie came out. It was a really suspenseful book so I was excited for the movie to come out. I had a feeling that the movie wouldn't be exactly like the book since that's whats happened in past experiences. When the movie ended I was thrilled. The movie stay very closely to the story line of the book and portrayed Suzanne Collins writing phenomenally! I would really recommend this movie.
B00D0Z2JR4|1.0|Am shoure the movie is great but not worth $100 especially for a simple dvd not even in engish. No thanks ill pass.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Did not like the way it was written, nor did I like the story - though I did read it to the end.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I have loved Ariana's voice ever since I found her on Youtube, so when I saw she had the album coming out, I was counting the days for the release! I was not disapointed. Her voice is beyond her years and this album has a feeling that comes with it that no other music has brought me. This is definitely the album of the year!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series of books.  It was a imaginative and exciting story line.  I was just a little disappointed in the ending so I gave it only 4 stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game had me very intrigued and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and puzzles. Keep up the great work. Can't wait for new levels.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This collection has all of my favorites and I've been listening to them over and over. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I love this series. Can't. Put the books down till I finish ish each one. CAnt wait to see what happens
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is one of my favorites to play. I play it every chance I get. Which is pretty much everyday. Awesome
B000FC1PNE|5.0|I love this series. Can't. Put the books down till I finish ish each one. CAnt wait to see what happens
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|really enjoyed it and will watch it again and again. I reccomend this to everyone. Buy it you will not be disappointed.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a great over all game.  Very fun, lots of options with car selection and level.  5  stars.<br /> Great game.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This was a confusing movie, Tom Cruise must have needed some cash flow. The movie is confusing because the hero does not know too much and still nothing is revealed to answer many questions. Like why they need water drained off of Earth, how many heroes are there?
B005H9B44A|3.0|I watched the whole thing, so that's a plus. Not bad for a super hero genre movie, with decent storyline.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is laid out just as it should be. And being able to view the history of calculations is an added bonus!
0312330537|5.0|A very close friend put this in my hand as I was leaving his house. I said its too big, I'll never finish it. I started reading and was immediately consumed, fascinated with Robert's sensitive, beautiful, gross,vivid descriptions. After I finished it, I missed it like an old, best friend had left town, and bought my own copy. READ IT!!! ITS WONDERFUL.
B00BBRR21Q|5.0|Can't believe I'm just discovering this. Bluesier background for Layne. Mike McCready shines. The extras are not always worth it on these extended versions, but these live versions are great.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like solitaire so you'd think I'd like this game but not so much. It's ok so I kinda could have done without buying it.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Dune is a classic. None of the movies can capture what this book brought to the table. Buy the kindle version to compliment your hardcover edition. Fear is the mind killer...
0679720200|1.0|Definition of condition was &#34;pristine.&#34;  Actual book was not even &#34;fair.&#34;  The cover was bent, the pages were soiled.  I paid what was a fairly high price to get a near new book.  What I got was a book so beaten up that I could only dump it into the trash.  It was supposed to be a gift.  I'll definitely remember this bookseller's name.
B006UUK612|4.0|My seven year old grandson didn't think he would like this because it was older and not as flashy as the new action movies are.  He loved it, it is still a good story.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I've been hearing about Dexter for years and years, and yet had no interest in watching a serial killer kill, rotten though his victims are. But I finally, 7 years in, gave the first episode a shot, and I am HOOKED. I have already bought and watched the first two seasons and am on season 3. This is not what I thought it would be at all, and he's not who I thought he would be at all. This is excellent writing, acting, and directing. And they did one thing that i love -- they nailed the &#34;Miami&#34; look and feel. I am a native of Miami and it drives me crazy how bad the stereotypes are of Miami (Miami Vice being the worst). But they did something right because they really caught the clothes, style, and feel of my native city. Try one episode of Dexter and see if you aren't surprised, as I was... And get hooked.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 sons love this puzzle app.  My son who is 3.5 years old is able to put the puzzles together by himself without any help.  It starting to be a little too &#34;young&#34; and &#34;easy&#34; for him though. My 1.5 year old needs help with the puzzle but he totally gets what he's supposed to be doing and tries to drag the pieces to where they go. He's likes solving the puzzle so that the pieces flip over and he can pop the balloons.  Great interaction.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|No weird combos or impossible puzzles just common sense search and use objects.  I don't feel like the developer is trying to show how much smarter they are than me, just trying to entertain me.  Thank you for once letting me enjoy an escape game without wanting to toss my kindle across the room!<br />(Not that I ever would, of course)
B0094M0P4G|5.0|I love Cher and Christina!  GREAT movie.  I liked it a lot.  I got it so when I travel I have something good to watch
B009QW7MQS|4.0|Brosnan was underappreciated as Bond. Following Timothy Dalton's melancholy and Roger Moore's clownish puns he provided just the right balance. That having been said this plot was probably the weakest of the bunch, but I would watch it again and again. If you are a Bond fan it's a no-brainer for enjoyable viewing.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Creative writing, enjoyed the journey the writer takes the readers on, I could not put this book down. Buy it!
B004KZOWEG|5.0|Soon into the book you'll find Stanley, having found Livingstone, moving on to become an unwitting helper to King Leopold of Belgium.  The utter brutality which Stanley helped usher in without any real understanding of Leopold, was to put it mildly unimaginable.  The rush for Africa was on and most European countries staked out colonial holdings with utter disregard for the native population.  It was ivory followed by natural rubber which generated billions for the invaders and nothing but death and destruction to the indigenous people.  It was forced labor/slavery at it's worst.  This book is highly descriptive and I really enjoyed having my eyes opened about the Congo...a place to this day which is extremely troubled...the legacy of colonialism and slavery.  Poor folks.  Sometimes it's not nice to read about this level of atrocity, but it serves the purpose of keeping it in front of the average man in the street who can appreciate such a great revealing of history...humans are seriously flawed creatures in my opinion.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|great books I read them about 6 months ago and now my husband is reading them and he seems to be reading all of the time<br />the garden is full of weeds hope he hurries up and finish them
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|If you like fantasy books that are not all about tortured teen romances, then this is a good book for you. Yeah, sure, there is the tortured romance angle, but the plot, characters and themes are so dynamic that you can't stop reading! I've flown through the first four books in the series. Very disappointed that I have to wait until next fall for the sixth book, but that's okay. It's worth waiting for. I highly recommend this series for those who love fantasy adventures!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|THe young boys were natural actors, very likable. McConaughey was good but not great.  All supporting people were very good, especially Sam Shephard.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Why have a help guide without the game?  This makes no sense whatsoever.  I would love to be able to play CCS on my Kindle instead of iPhone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a very addicting and fun game, all my friends have told me about this game cause they love it.
B000KKPN5C|1.0|Probably better than the pop up flash but the bounce head only swivels one way and you cannot slave it up. The flash will not power on unless it is mounted on a camera.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|seems too difficult and boring. don't recommend this kind of app again.filling out this review sucks cause the app sucked.
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|I am very pleased with the new NIN album. After The Slip, which had a some good songs but felt like a random assortment of songs with no connection or binding concept, I am happy to see that NIN is back with a top-notch album. Of course, as other reviewers have mentioned, this is not The Downward Spiral, and for those of us who have grown up with Nine Inch Nails, this is a good thing. Reznor has matured along with the tools he uses to make music, and in turn has created music that is not meant to be \\"more of the same,\\" and is not an attempt to appeal to the masses or sate the musical appetites of those who \\"only like old NIN.\\" Go listen to the Downward Spiral and cry yourself to sleep if you are disappointed that we didn't get an \\"Even further Down The Spiral.\\" For those of you who something new and fresh, give it a listen.  This is the best album NIN has produced in over a decade, and has a very solid and conceptual feel to it.<br /><br />Don't let the negative reviews divert you from enjoying this positive experience!
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|You can't go wrong with Susan Tedeschi. I thought she had disappeared, but found out she was just in love. Her union with Allman Brother's Trucks is musical genius.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works like I need and FREE!  Couldn't ask for something easier, it just .works.  Probably great for kids too. It's big and easy to use.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This is really a nice compilation with my favorite blue's singer Susan Tedeschi. Trucks adds to the flavor of the salty music.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|HER MUSIC IS Ethereal,I wish she'd do a VOL.2. She is one of the GREATEST<br />SINGERS Of OUR TIME. I HAVE E V E R Y T H I N G she's ever done!!!<br />Whoever reads this review PLEASE listen to one of her works,You'll know what I mean!<br /><br />AND E-mail me what YOU think! [if you are so inclined] CAP*
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Just not as impressed as I thought I'd be... They summarized the story well enough for the viewing window,  but I feel like more could have been done, but I guess that would have just made the film longer & less grasping as some audience member lost interest. That's what we get though, original script writing might be a thing of the past & more remakes and novels to big screen productions are what we can expect...
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fantastic! Loved the imagery the author created. I absolutely recommend this book. I read it in one day. Read it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great story.  Amazing research.  Can't wait for the second book.  Sorry that is it only a trilogy.  Highly recommend taking the time to read this book.
0545265355|4.0|I had been avoiding these books as they seemed like a colossal rip-off of the amazing Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. After I saw the film version of The Hunger Games I realized that was not the case, and I enjoyed the movie enough that I dove into the books.<br /><br />I read these books so quickly I actually can't tell them apart, it's really one story after all, so I decided to write one review.<br /><br />The first person perspective of the stories gives a completely different insight into the character than the movie did. It's much more interesting this way, you get a real insight into why Katniss is doing what, and it helps flesh out the political maneuvering everyone is up to. The books reveal in greater detail just how dangerous all of this is and just what is at stake and why. I don't think the movie did it justice.<br /><br />These stories are well done, plotted at high speed, and they pleasantly surprised me many times with a number of unexpected twists. They are worth your time.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|happy to have all the music from this tv show. the music is one of the main reasons that I watch the show
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Jane Austen is an excellent author! And this series is very similiar to the book. LOVE LOVE LOVE. A MUST see.
B0013ND30M|5.0|The Sleeping Beauty DVD arrived in great condition and on time. I was very pleased with the quality and will order like products in the future.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Loved it -I ordered all of her others. She really had a page turner with this one. Can't wait to start on the others.
B0094M2X6Y|3.0|As is often the case, the movie fell too far short of the book. It was fun to see Burrough's Mars come to life, visually, but the characters and script were disappointing. I don't mind tweaking characters to make them more palatable to modern tastes, but Deja Thoris as a Mars physicist, for example, came across as just silly. I think she could have been a strong female character without completely reinventing her role.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love the game. It's fun, and addictive. It would be better if there weren't so many facebook or Twitter goals!
140006922X|1.0|Islam is as dangerous in a man as rabies is in a dog. Never have those words rang more true than after this completely biased and unintelligent idiotic author.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm so addicted to this series by George R.R. Martin! It's the most unpredictable and exciting fantasy series I've ever read. None of the characters are depicted as all good or all bad. Some you love to hate and a few you hate to love! Wicked, gritty, raw and definitely not your typical &#34;happily ever after.&#34; Refreshing.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is fun, yet challenging.  It would be easy enough for young kids to play - my little guy likes the sounds the buttons make as they drop. The harder levels are challenging and fun for the grownups!
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|I do not know why people are willing to listen to arguments with an accent as opposed to american english.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Just updated (9/1) but now it won't so much as open. Ifnally got to the login, entered my info, then it crashed again. Please fix! I have a Kindle Fire 7&quot;.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I've been a die hard fan of Trent's work since around 1994.  With Teeth was the first sign that Nine Inch Nails will always make good music, but the glory days of the 80s and 90s were certainly over.  In recent days, Trent's work with film scores and How To Destroy Angels have been his shining moments.<br /><br />I wasn't too fond of Came Back Haunted when I heard it and assumed this was going to be a let down.  I was wrong. This album is SOLID back to front.  There are different styles, it has a nice flow and Trent delivers some of his best vocal performances to date.  For me, this is the best NIN album since The Fragile and is up there with some of his best works.
B000001ESF|5.0|If you really like getting stoned, and you really like music, then you will like this. Especially if you're stoned.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|It seems plausible how desperate a dying man may become.  I can't wait to view the next season.  Enjoyed it.
1421527618|4.0|The title of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's breakthrough novel might be enough to draw a reader into his world, but the book itself stands on its own two legs in the vein of good, pulpy science fiction.<br />  Originally published in 2004 in Sakurazaka's native Japanese, the book was heralded by the Japanese science fiction culture and was considered to be his greatest novel to date. It was eventually published in English in 2009 to the same kind of applause and hype. Now slated for a major motion picture starring Tom Cruise called The Edge Of Tomorrow, Sakurazaka's work is slated for further recognition.<br />  The plot is genius in its simplicity. The protagonist is a soldier caught in a two-day time loop in which he is forced to die and fight, over and over again. As this repetition occurs, he becomes a better soldier with each revolution through time. The climax of the story is satisfying, and even delivers a bit of the twist that seems to be a favorite story device in recent years.<br />  This book is bubblegum for your brain. It is sweet and simple in its simplicity, and yet it lasts just the right amount of time. Any more time in Sakurazaka's world might be too much. This is where he succeeds in weaving a great tale. At a succinct 200 pages, the novel is easily read in one sitting, and it almost insists upon the reader to do so as the final chapters begin to roll in a staccato rhythm. There are few characters to worry about, which allows Sakurazaka the ample time to develop the two central characters without taking away from the story's tempo.<br />  The short work comes to an almost screeching halt at the end. This, in the hands of a good reader, is a brilliant story device. The same thing in anyone else's hands might mar the stories potential. Someone who doesn't take the time to fully investigate Sakurazaka's use of tempo might be dissatisfied with the quick and clean outcome of Kill. The double-edged sword for Sakurazaka is that this type of book tends to attract areader who might not invest the kind of time necessary to evaluate it in the proper light. The solution to this is not clear.<br />Anyone who finds this book to be entertaining should also check out anything written by Robert Heinlein. Any fan of Sakurazaka's should also check out the `80s classic Armor by John Steakley. In fact, Steakley's Armor is almost a must read if Kill finds itself in any way onto a reader's favorite shelf.<br />  In the end, Sakurazaka achieves what he set out to, with a fast-paced, easy read that catches your attention early and maintains it throughout. All You Need Is Kill may be all you need for a pleasant evening spent traveling to another world.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love all these books but this is my favorite it's was the best summer reading book I have read yet
B004132I20|5.0|This is an incredibly written, scripted, acted, and filmed show. It is set in current era but the observations by Sherlock are still uncanny. If you like superb acting, excellent story lines, action and current use of technology you will love this show. I highly recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Absolutely love this game.I love bingo and will continue to play it. I never have had any technical issues with this game as I do with other games
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The BBC has had numerous successful shows lately, and Broadchurch is no exception! Olivia Colman is heart-breakingly good as DS Ellie Miller. The story, the characters, the town--it all comes together in a hauntingly beautiful mystery.
0062255657|4.0|Great story from a great author. If you like Neil Gaiman you will like this book. A bit shorter than I am used to reading from him, but I enjoyed it.
B000I3PERS|5.0|This is the worrior story that every one would want to live , He either lived free or died . The movie creats lots of enthusiasm and awakens morals and deep principals in a historical way . This is 2013 and I still snjoyed seeing it after many years . Mel Gibson is a great director and actor , deverses all the respect .<br />Wallace , of course , depicts features of true men , that any would want to be around such a character .<br />And its true that Tyranny wins , but short lived . Courage and love outlives and persists .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just recently finished watching seasons 1 & 2.  I had heard of so many people touting this series.  I watched both seasons in a couple of sittings.  I LOVED it.  I love thinking back to the days it portrayed and it was hard for me to not want to watch more shows in that time period.  I have purchased season 3, can't wait to have the time to watch it in one setting.  Really looking forward to season 4 in January.  Highly recommend it to all.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Well done, constant action, far better actor for Dredd. Couldn't ask for much more from a Dredd flick. Really hope they take the franchise in to several more movies!
B003SNJZ3Y|4.0|Mallaby frames the history of hedged funds in a sympathetic light.  There are lessons here too about asymmetrical trades, hidden risks (like liquidity), and perverse incentives.  Also on display is human nature: the gloating hubris of the winners and the incredulous humility of PhDs who've suffered.  An easy read for investors and those interested in the not so seedy underbelly of finance.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is alot of fun it has classic way and puzzle way this is so much fun you loose track of time!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Fits perfectly! Looks great! Improves survivability of your kindle! The kids love them. I'd buy it again in an instant.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is exciting! A series I can enjoy & my sons suggested it to me! I really enjoy having a bond with my kids like this ;-D
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Better story. Better details. This wasn't all sensationalism. Much better than the new movie. The actors are great in this movie and the new one. I thought this one went deeper into the story and made more sense with the details. I haven't seen the other versions to comment.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Beautiful graphics, 100 levels of 3 or more of the same item match. Build a tree community with the fairies/elves.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A book that is almost impossible to put down. The story grabs you and before you turn another page, you are engrossed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally addicting in a very good way! This Spring my sister bought the series. She got me, my Mom & Dad, my other sister AND her hard to please husband ALL HOOKED! Then I came home, watched all three seasons with my husband , who obviously is a huge fan also now. My family can't wait for the next season. This is wonderful for most adult age groups, and men & women alike. Hurry and get the next season out PLEASE!!!
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Started the movie and soon realized the I was watching a pre-programed video game.  All action impossible except in a video game - motorcycle leap of a roof into the windshield of a helocopter --ya right!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|There is nothing that compares to the sound of her voice. I enjoy listening to this album whenever I have a chance
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Excellent quality, compact, and tons of juice for my mobile phone and Nexus tablet. Great value for a great product.
1439181780|5.0|This is by far my favorite by Rhonda Byrne.  Every page gives you the chills and by the end of the book, your life will drastically improve.
B0000CABBW|3.0|I got this for a little girl in the family.  It is a lovely story and great for a female to view  especially if one likes nature and animals. Empowering story for families and girls.
1582701709|5.0|This book is amazing.  The Secret is amazing.  I think that everyone needs to read this book and not only will they have an amazing life, but we will make each other's lives that much better.  The message is so simple, yet so powerful.
B004Y6MIXS|4.0|Alfa has really impressed me here, supports monitor mode and Linux.. No complaints with the chipset,but the antenna could use some improvement.
1451673442|5.0|So great! This book will open up a whole new world right before your eyes.  It may sound silly to some, but those who read it and understand will change their life.
B002BJGYU8|4.0|I'm watching this because for some reason I missed it the seasons it was a hit?  I like the two Gilmore girls, dislike grandmother a lot.  I fast forward whenever she is on the tape.<br />The mother/daughter relationship is a beautiful one.  I'm sure all mothers wish they could handle their daughter like she handles Rory.  The problems they deal with are very real, but can be quite troublesome as well.  Not everything ends well, but they will bounce back.  I'm thinking the story is quite predictable, but maybe not. I guess I'll have to wait.  I'm only on disc 3.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addicting.I've never had two of the same prizes before because I'm trading them for more coins. Also coins regenerate over time so play before you go to bed and when you wake up in the morning you have 40 plus coins.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I'm watching this story for the second time.  I taught World History and love historical fiction of that time.  I ran across a book entitled LIVING IN DOWNTON ABBEY, or something like that at our local library.  Absolutely fascinating.......then I had to watch the tapes again.  Watching for specifics that happen in Downton Abbey are eye openers now,  Never noticed before the book.  What a life they led.......and the jobs that were created for people of that time with helping to run these big money houses.  AND then the different life styles that were created when different jobs/technology came about and the houses started to fade out and many different jobs were created.<br />What a business as well as pressure to have an heir.  Reminds you of the Kings of England and their lifestyle
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy playing, love the challenges, the only thing I do not like is the ads that keep breaking into my game. Very irritating.
