B0053YGYO4|4.0|20 years ago desperate for reinvention U2 through a guitar at an amplifier not caring what came out as long as it was different from their 1980's music. Achtung Baby was the result an album that many say is one of the best of the past 20 years. That came AFTER U2 already became a dominant force in rock and roll. Why am I citing that reference to review Coldplay's new album? I'm not sure if its Coldplay or their record company but there's been an insistance on U2 comparisons through recent years even to the point where Coldplay hired longtime U2 producer Brian Eno. By the way, U2's Achtung Baby came out the same year that Nirvana released \\"Nevermind\\" and Pearl Jam recorded \\"Ten\\". R.E.M. had just released back-to-back gems \\"Out of Time\\" and \\"Automatic for the People\\". These are all top albums of the past 20 years - a remarkably competitive time.  Mylo Xyloto is Coldplay's 5th album in their 13th year as a band. Achtung Baby was U2's 7th album at the same point of their career. Achtung Baby was an edgy masterpiece. The album sold well in a highly competitive market. Mylo Xyloto is nowhere close to that album. Not that its a bad album in fact I think its reasonably good. But the U2 comparisons have to stop. And rock and roll may not be dead but it is greatly diminished. That hurts Coldplay - a non-competive market does not inspire creativity. It inspires Mylo Xyloto.  While Mylo Xyloto is forgettable as compared to the great rock and roll albums of the past 20 years - and that has to be said because Coldplay wants to be considered a seriously huge band - its is a very good album in today's market.   The sound of the album is terrific. The layered textures of the songs is brilliant. The producers did a great job creating a sound that upon 3-4 listens is hard to get out of your mind. The slower songs which are reminiscent of Parachutes are weak. The more grandiose songs such as Paradise and Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall are not as glorious as Viva La Vida or Clocks but are in that ballpark.   The problem with this album is that Coldplay has little to say. It doesn't have to be politics and it can all be lovelorn as Coldplay songs tend to be but say it with a clever line or 2 or maybe through a personal story and vary the theme somewhat of each song. Coldplay claim this album is uplifting and it is when you look at many of the songs which offer inspiration but after whining.  The lead tune Hurts Like Heaven is a great song - one of their all-time best. Its really the only song I go back to. Major Minus is one of if not the best guitar-oriented songs they've ever released. I would also say - similar to Achtung Baby - there is a running theme through the album which is impressive because that approach is rarely heard nowadays.  I recommend the album and give it 4 stars because the production is immense an even the Rhianna song after a few listens is pretty good. There are a few songs here that will end up on Coldplays Greatest Hits but a year from now when I put on Coldplay it will probably be Parachutes or Rush of Blood that I'm listening to. I can see what they're trying to do here but the band needs a bit more edge and desperately needs something to say.  The Amazon reviews offer nearly as many 1-star as 5-star reviews. Any they are all correct.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King has always been at his best when writing about people.  Most of the time, as in 11/22/63, the supernatural plays a major part.  Sometimes, the supernatural has nothing to do with it, as in Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  Either way, it's the thoughts, reactions, relationships, yearnings, weaknesses, strengths of his characters that make the stories so compelling.  In fact, it might be fair to say that King's work weakens whenever he allows the supernatural, science-fiction aspects to overwhelm his characters.  An example is The Tommyknockers.  More often, the supernatural elements serve to reveal and shape the characters, as in Christine.  11/22/63 flows from the question that underlies all good fiction:  What if.....?  What if a regular Joe could travel back in time and undo the assassination of President John F. Kennedy?  The regular Joe is a high school English teacher named Jake Epping. The means is a \\"rabbit hole\\" in the storeroom of the diner run by Jake's acquaintance Al.  It is Al who plants the idea of changing history, but he doesn't have to work very hard.  Jake was born in the 1970's, and he has lived in a world created by the likes of Ronald Reagan, the Bushes, and even Bill Clinton.  Kennedy seems a shining knight, who, if he had only lived, would have prevented the disaster of Vietnam and all that followed it.  So Jake goes through the hole into the world of September, 1958.  He has five years to live before he can save Kennedy, and he is armed with Al's notes from his own efforts (before he came down with lung cancer), and with a plan.  The plan requires moving to Texas.  There, Jake, now George Amberson, finds himself falling in love with Sadie Dunhill, a refugee from a miserable marriage now living in the small town of Jodie, Texas.  There are more people, of course, and Jake/George comes to love most of them.  He has made a life in Jodie, and it's that life that's put on the line in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  As George, and Sadie, rush to save Kennedy, the suspense mounts.  I'll not spoil it by telling you how it turns out, except to say that George then faces choices more difficult than stepping into a rabbit hole. The ending of the book soars, and that King gives credit to his son for the idea diminishes it not in the least.<br /><br />The presentation of the date in the title, of course, brings to mind 9/11, for it is usually written just that way.  Jake/George accepts that Kennedy's death was as great a tragedy for the nation as 9/11 and is linked with it in ineluctable ways.  In a post 9/11 world, who could be blamed for yearning for a way to change the course of events that led us to that fateful day and its aftermath--two interminable wars, a tanking national economy, an entire generation of veterans scarred by Iraq and Afghanistan?  King hooks us at that point and draws us in.  Though his research into Oswald's movements is accurate, he never allows that research to divert him from the essential story line.  The \\"what if\\" never gets lost, and when it's answered, it literally turns Jake/George's world upside down.  9/11/63 is also a commentary on the persistence of love and its power to shape and reshape our lives.<br /><br />Are there weaknesses in the book?  Of course, and most of them are typical of King's other work.  For instance, he has Fred Dunning driving a Pontiac Bonneville in 1958.  Certainly a possibility, though it should be remembered that in 1958 a Bonneville sold for more than a Cadillac--not a likely ride for a meatcutter.  Perhaps King meant the more prosaic Star Chief.  When Jake/George buys his own car in 1958, he chooses a 1953 Ford Sunliner with a Y-block V-8.  The Y-block was introduced on the 1954 models.  The '53 made do with the lowly flathead.  King's right, though, that the Y-block had oiling problems--just not in the '53s.  When Jake/George is in Derry, Maine, he runs into two of the kids featured in King's earlier work, IT, which was set in that unfortunate town.  This strikes me as a kind of literary laziness, and I wish King hadn't done it.  But I pressed ahead, and my persistence was rewarded.<br /><br />You might say I was obdurate, and this leads me to my closing comment.  A key phrase is \\"the past is obdurate.\\"  That simply means that it resists being changed, as Jake/George discovers many times in his mission to rescue Kennedy.  Those of us who are of an age might reflect on this when we start feeling the usual regrets over what was and what might have been.  Who knows?  Maybe everything that happens is indeed supposed to happen in just the way it does.  If that's the case, then too much nostalgia for the old days won't help.  Learning to live in the present will.This strikes me as a kind of literary laziness, and I wish King hadn't done it.  But I pressed ahead, and my persistence was rewarded.

1451648537|3.0|Steve Jobs is one of greatest personalities in the tech industry. His products were almost inspiring even for a tech person like me. But I was surprised that the book was pretty boring mostly due to the life style of Mr. Jobs. He is clearly neither the personality I would like to take on nor was he an affable, adorable person. He is probably the kind of boss who would make your life miserable, extract the best out of you by driving you crazy. I have great admiration for Mr. Job's professional accomplishments, but I kind of felt he was neither a great artist nor a radical technologist in himself -- he figured how to drive others crazy to world's end and create great products. Unfortunately he does not measure up to Albert Einstein or Benjamin Franklin. I would consider $17 as not well spent. Watch the documentary videos, may be pirates of silicon valley and call it a day. I would say -- just another great business man who had great taste in terms of design, but really nothing else.

B003LQMZS0|5.0|This giraffe is my son's favorite toy so I had to write a review.  He is 12 weeks old now and just loves to bat at the four different toys hanging from the giraffe's legs.  Each toy provides a different sensory experience - it is educational and keeps him interested.  My son has now started to grab the rings and the other toys and he trys to put them in his mouth.  He also loves to look at the giraffe's face and the spots on his body.  He never bores of this giraffe - it makes him so happy!  Really this is just a great toy I recommend it over others of a similar character.

0385508417|5.0|I have seen many mixed reviews for this book, mostly by people who took the concept of skipping Christmas to heart.  But I thought it was a wonderful bok with some valuable lessons.  First, it is simply a satire about how crazy the ppressures of the holidays can be.  And I think that is how we are meant to read it.  But there is also the theme of learning what it means to put our selfish desires aside at this special time of year and be a community, as the community helped the Kranks for Blair in this story even thoough Luther was so selfish.  I definitely think Grisham is making the point about looking outside of ourselves and remembering the true spirit of Christmas.  Sure, most of us would not harass someone who decided to go on a vacation for Christmas rather than spend it at home, but it was a device that made this story work.  While this is nothing to be compared to Dickens, you definitely see the Scrooge influence here in Luthor's character.  At any rate, no matter how you take it, this is a great, fun holiday read.  The movie is wonderful, too.  My suggestion is read and enjoy the truths about how out of hand things can get at Christmas.  Then go tell your loved ones Merry Christmas!
B005URRCUY|5.0|So everyone seems to think that The Black Keys purists are not allowed to like their new sound. Well i've been a fan of this band since their first album, and i still love them. The people who are claiming the have sold out, or changed for the worse are just upset cuz The Black Keys found mainstream success. Sorry to say every band is in it for the money and wants to be successful. I think, as a fan from the very start, this album is fun and energetic. Side note- classic bands like The Beatles and Led Zeppelin don't sound the same from start to finish of their career.

For those looking for tons of extras, postcards, a T-Shirt, etc..., this set is not for you.

B001FOR5XU|5.0|I don't like vampire novels much, so I wasn't planning to read Richard Matheson's classic vampire story I am Legend which was published in 1954, is also known by the title The Omega Man, and is, of course, the basis for the movie I am Legend.<br /><br />But then I recently read and was enthralled by two other books by Matheson: The Incredible Shrinking Man and Steel and Other Stories. I realized that The Incredible Shrinking Man wasn't really so much about a man who was losing his height as it was about a man who was losing his manhood. Likewise, the novella \\"Steel,\\" the titular piece of Steel and Other Stories and the premise for the movie Real Steal, isn't so much about a fighting robot as it is about a man who, similar to the shrinking man, is fighting to keep his position in life. The psychological aspects of these stories fascinated me and I began to wonder if perhaps I am Legend wasn't really about vampires after all.<br /><br />As I suspected, it's not. Well, on the surface it is. Robert Neville is the last human being on Earth. Everyone else has been infected with a virus that causes vampirism, but for some reason, Robert is immune. He spends his daytime hours securing his house, staking vampires, and trying to discover a cure for the virus. At night he hides indoors while the vampires, some who are his former acquaintances, try to break in. During the story there are flashbacks which show the gradual loss of Robert's family and friends to vampirism.<br /><br />I was fascinated by Robert's preparations and daytime activities, and his studies to find the cause and cure for the virus. The thought, for example, of having free access to anything you want, including cars, jewelry, clothes, houses, art, scientific equipment, and every book in every bookstore and library in the world is exhilarating... until you realize that there's nobody to share it with. All those things are almost meaningless outside of their social context.<br /><br />So, this is Matheson's gut-wrenching focus -- what it means to be the last human on Earth, especially when you're fighting for your life. We all know that humans are social creatures, but none of us has actually experienced a total lack of companionship. What would it mean to rule the entire world alone? And yet, as depressing as that is, why, when there's nothing to live for, do we still cling to life so desperately? Matheson writes so powerfully about these emotions. I ached for Robert Neville and a few of Matheson's scenes had me in tears.<br /><br />The story is called I am Legend because Robert Neville gradually comes to realize that vampires, the creatures he thought were only legend, are real. Now, Robert Neville, the elusive human being who vampires fear, has become the legend.<br /><br />I listened to Blackstone Audio's version of I am Legend which is perfectly read by Robertson Dean. This is one I will listen to again. By the way, I am Legend is not a full-length novel, so some versions include additional stories in a collection called I am Legend and Other Stories.the last human on Earth, especially when you're fighting for your life.

B0001932ZA|5.0|So many people who reviewed this over at internet movie data base point out that item by item, everything this movie predicts about the future has come true. Here on Amazon it appears no reviewers have made this connection. Let me be the first.<br /><br />I should note that it's very rare for this to be rerun on TV. At least I can't recall seeing it. Out of sight out of mind, or does it's absence disturb us even more? When Ben Richards warns Killian, \\"I'll be back\\" and Killian glibly responds with, \\"Only in a rerun\\" kid, Killian is lying once again, just for reasons we may not suspect.<br /><br />This is a must for any Arnold Swartznegger fan. I am a huge fan. Everything appearing in his other films seems to appear in this one. It's almost a movie made up from parts of other Swartznegger movies. This is just a comment about Arnold's performance. The story is unique with a life of it's own. It's definitely more light-hearted than the Stephen King story the film is based upon.<br /><br />I want to compare this to George Lucas' film 'THX 1138'. They both have conflicting visions of the future. One, 'THX 1138', is about a world that has no soul. Everything, or morality, is based on money or financial considerations. It's probably not true but it could be argued that THX 1138 is not about the future at all but an examination of our present society.<br /><br />The Running Man satires a world that seems to force an oversentimentality - perhaps equally as fake and bankcrupt, or perhaps they are worlds which are both equally corrupt. Perhaps the Running Man is more relevant to our own time where, when tragedy strikes, for example, as many grief councelors as lawyers as news crew members arrive on the scene. Perhaps both films deal with many of the same concerns.<br /><br />Pehaps most wont agree with me but I think there's something 'conservative' about this movie, or that's where the filmmakers are coming from. There's a funny scene in the movie, where a TV announcer claims of a convict, \\"She's had sex with as many as 2 or 3 men, in a year!\\" in an alarmed voice. It was if this part were added, to show to some viewers, 'see this really is a bad future'. When in reality this scene is making fun of these very viewers. Those who might have to hear this ridiculous statement before they notice something is askew. Sometimes I'm at a loss for words explaining what they heck I'm thinking about. . .

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I am a heavy calendar user for business and I've spent a lot of time trying calendar apps. I've bought a lot of them, too. Calengoo was the last calendar app I tried and paid for. I've been using it nonstop for 6 months and it completely destroys all others (including especially Pocket Informant, but also Business Calendar, Jorte, Calendar Pad, etc.). One of it's best features is snoozable alarms. You normally have to install something like Calendar Snooze to get this level of reliability. I like that I don't need two separate apps (a calendar and a snooze-app) to get the job done. This app has never let me down. It is extremely reliable, has great view options (I usually use the daily view, but also week and month view at times) and has widgets (something I don't use but I realize are highly desirable by many users). If you are looking for the best calendar app, I'd just get this one and be done with it. You won't regret it!

Since then, they've raised the price. As a free app, I'd download it and try it. You've got nothing to lose. I really wanted to love this app, but I finally realized a few months ago it was just never going to cut it. I tried Business Calendar but it was a bit glitchy (particularly with reminders). I've been using Calengoo for the past 6 months or so and it is far superior in every way. It has widgets, has snoozable alarms/reminders, integrates with google tasks (which I don't use), and has many great calendar views. I see that Calengoo is currently on sale 1/2 price on Amazon. I'd go with that if I were you!

If you love power metal and great musicianship, this masterpiece is for you.  Tobias really takes his signature sound (lots of great hooks) and elevates Avantasia to heights Edguy could only dream of. BONUS: I truly love all the guest singers, the who's who of power metal. You get to enjoy their uniqueness as well as Tobias.  Really makes you sit back and pay attention to each song.  Don't miss out like I was on this album or any of the Avantasia works.

0307946711|2.0|I chose this book because I felt as though it may be different. It's not often that you follow a story about two people based on one day every year. It made me hopeful that I would be reading something different, fresh, with new ideas; and up until the end, I wasn't entirely disappointed. That, however, changed when the book reached Paris. I was hopeful when it seemed as though the main character, Emma, had found strength against Dex, and was excited to think that this book may be leaning toward choosing a different path than so many other books of the same genre before it. I was disappointed, though, but pushed through, thinking 'ok, well, perhaps it won't be so thoroughly predictable later'. I was almost infuriated with the toward the end \\"twist\\", though. It wasn't that I was irritated that there would be no fairy tale ending, it was that this type of ending has been done time and time again, I am so sick of this type of soap opera \\"twist\\". If I can predict what's coming, that doesn't make it a twist, and it doesn't make it interesting, it makes the book a waste of my time; which is such a shame, because, like I said, it started out with such promise. All in all, it was an o.k. book. The premise was interesting, one day out of each year, but in the end, it became just another blase book, like so many others before it, with a predictability of 10 on a 1-10 scale. So unfortunate.

Frankly I don't understand how somebody with a proper taste could find a balance between 50+ strings and 2 oboes (for example) to be satisfying.<br />The sound of the period instruments tuned at a proper pitch is very colorful and it is almost like you can hear each individual player.  That and the fresh faster tempos create a great virtuoso spirit.
0439023491|4.0|I would say without a doubt the best and most memorable book I have read in recent years was [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]].  It truly blew me away and I couldn't put it down.  So needless to say, I was excited and anxious to read Catching Fire, the second book in The Hunger Games triology.<br /><br />SPOILERS below:<br />Catching Fire picks up several months after The Hunger Games ends. Katniss is back home in District 12 but everything is different.  She has been moved to the plush \\"victors village\\", a village where the victors of the Hunger Game get to live.  Peeta lives next door but things remain awkward after Katniss admission that the their love was just part of the game for her.  Haymitch is drunk again.  Gale is working in the mines and doesn't have time to hunt with her anymore.  And Katniss can't shake the nightmares.<br /><br />Then things get worse.  Katniss is visited by President Snow in her home and told if she doesn't convince the world that she really loves Peeta and acted out of deep love, rather than a desire to embarrass the Capital, everyone she knows would be in danger.  When Katniss fails, rebellion begins and her life gets darker.  New Peacekeepers are brought into District 12.  Gone are the Peacekeepers who joked with them and turned a blind eye to minor infractions.  The new Peacekeepers are violent and harsh.  They place gallows in the town square, hold, public whippings, burn the hob down, and seem to delight in trying to catch people breaking the rules.  Then the biggest surprise is revealed and Katniss and other surviving victors would be put back into The Hunger Games!<br /><br />And this time President Snow wants to make sure she doesn't make it out - from rating her at the highest mark of 12, to inspire other tributes to target her and Peeta, to having Cinna beat before her eyes just before the start of the games to unnerve her, nothing is out of the question.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending.  But I will say while this book was still exciting and Collins still painted a great picture, like most sequals, it was not as good as the first.  I really did not care for the return to The Hunger Games because I felt like it was just trying to capitalize on what made the first book so exciting.  A rebellion uprising in District 12 could have been just as exciting and presented an entirely new challenge instead of reliving what happened in the first.  Still a good book but it falls just short of a 5 star rating for me.k was still exciting and Collins still painted a great picture, like most sequals, it was not as good as the first.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought this little dude at Wal Mart for $3.78, and it's great for pocketknives. I carry my grandfather's old pocketknife, and it now has a razor's edge on it for the first time in 20 years (too sentimental for whetrocks), and it took only 2 minutes to sharpen it and add a razor edge. This is great for all around use

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Rarely do screenplays stand up againt the novel..The Help is one of the few movies I would recomend to everyone. I find it very hard to enjoy a movie from beginning to end, and this movie is one that will not let you down. One of the Great films that have the pleasure of making us think twice about our lives and our purpose. Whether or not you agreee with me, this movie will not have you regret the time you spent watching it..The Help really makes you feel. Makes you feel for a lot of things. And absolutely makes you grateful for everything you do have, even if its not much.  re re
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This cover is a worthwhile investment to protect your Kindle Fire from damage in everyday handling. There is a flap that folds to make the Kindle stand up on a flat surface. It also makes it easier to read the Kindle when lying in bed. The flap allows me to grip the kindle in my left hand so my right hand is free to scroll. I have a few suggestions to improve the cover. The graphite color is not very appealing to me...its dark and drab, although some people may prefer to keep their Kindle less decorative and more businesslike. It shows fingerprints too, which can be wiped off, but a different material wouldn't show them at all. Moreover, the groove that holds the folding flap needs to be a bit deeper so it will stand up more firmly. Sometimes the flap slips and the Kindle tips over until you get it just right, which is annoying. But overall it's a good product to own.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Without a doubt, this is still one of the most suspenseful and scary movies of all time. Great actors and direction. Hitchcock couldn't have done better. Unlike current 'horror' movies which are just disturbing and gross, this is one of the last truly great horror movies of all time. This really will make you 'afraid to go into the water'.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I just received this watch a few days ago and have only played with it sparingly. I will updated this review as time goes.<br /><br />Controls:<br />Not the best, but a noble attempt. The bevel is used as a touch device to select or maneuver items in the menu. It took some getting used to. I had to scroll my finger about 5 times to move to the next item in the menu.<br /><br />GPS:<br />It was accurate for my first run. I did 8 miles outside at 75% and it tracked everything accurately from my heartbeat to my pace. It has a nice feature that beeps at you and displays the mile pace at each mile. You can change this to beep at a different distance, but the mile marker makes sense.<br /><br />Downloading to my computer:<br />It took a few tries, but it finally worked. It uploaded all of my stats in about 30 seconds and I was able to see all of my data for the run online. I downloaded \\"Garmin Training Center\\" on the Mac App Store and it was able to collect this data as well to have it locally on my computer.<br /><br />I have never owned a watch that does this so I am just blown away at the information it offers. This will definitely improve my overall ability to control my pace.<br /><br />Of course, this is one run and I can't speak to the durability. I sweat a lot, but I live in the desert(Tucson, AZ). The dry weather helps combat against ruining my tech while I'm out running. I visit humid locations quite a bit and will post updates. But I can say that in one run, the watch did not die, everything worked as it was supposed to and I am impressed. My only complaint is that the controls could have been improved by not allowing the bevel touch as a control. It's a noble attempt, but misses the mark.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/18/2012<br /><br />I've had to opportunity to thoroughly use the watch. I have no complaints. The battery has never died on me. I run around 3-4 times a week, about 40 minutes to 1.5 hours each time and the watch has performed as advertised. This product has been through extreme heat, rain, and cold. In each case the watch did not falter. I ran a marathon and sweat all over it and it still performed well.<br /><br />Just to add, I don't use this watch all day. I dry it off as soon as I finish running and immediately charge it thereafter. The watch has never ran below 90%. of charge. I can't be sure if not allowing the watch to die down in battery every once and a while is a bad thing, but time will tell. Knock on some wood, but the problems that have occurred with other people in the reviews for this product have not occurred with me. This product has changed the way I run. I can see my pace, and heart rate to give myself a gauge of how fast I should run if I want to maintain a certain time. Before, I had to read my pulse using my wrist which can slow me down and my pace was a guesstimate based on my cadence. My running has improved from a 6:45-7:00 min/mile pace to a 6:15-6:30 mile/pace over an 8 mile stretch. I believe this is due to my ability to watch and understand my pace over a period of time, thanks to the watch.

B00656C6KK|4.0|As an actress,this \\"sweetheart\\" has great talent.She starred with such legendary people as Rock Hudson,Cagney and Stewart.In this particular collection, I enjoy her style to such classic tunes as Daydream.The Lovin'Spoonful blew your cares away,and Day makes every trouble fade into the wind.I also love the sweet hit You Are So Beautiful To Me.Joe Cocker originally wailed this vow of love and devotion.Day is sweet with this standard, and her words make your heart just melt.  Another cute tune I enjoy is Disney Girls.With this great ballad from Toni Tennille,Day is bluesy and light.Doris Day is still as sweet and lovely;She never changes.Her voice is marvellous, and makes you feel right at home.

I cannot recommend this film enough - from the cast and crew, to the story - a job WELL done. Thank you.
0385535139|4.0|I enjoyed The Litigators. In fact, I stayed up far too late reading it, and paid the price the next day by feeling sluggish and exhausted!  The book revolves around David Zinc, a lawyer at a large New York law firm who is being worked to death by an unfeeling, unreasonable boss. David has a meltdown and leaves the office, never to return. He gets falling-down drunk at a downtown bar and ends up in front of a small, down-at-heel law firm - which he joins.  While the scenario of a top lawyer joining a seedy little firm stretches the imagination a little beyond belief, Grisham uses humour to get you past this. The sad-sack lawyers, hard-as-nails secretary and even the office dog (named AC for ambulance chaser) keep you interested and entertained.  One of the lawyers, Wally, participates in a class-action lawsuit, convinced he'll make millions from it by the big-name tort litigators who are running it. But the evidence on which the suit is based is faulty, and the \\"big boys\\" pull out. The test case happens to be one of Wally's clients and he and his firm are stuck presenting it, even though they have minimal court experience.  When Wally, his partner Oscar and David realize they have to go ahead with the high-profile, impossible test case - or get sued for millions by the defendant for bringing a frivolous lawsuit - they hit rock bottom. Grisham keeps you chuckling as he draws out the empathy for these fleabag lawyers. \\"Hey Iris, guess what? You owe half of $9 million,\\" David imagines telling their client, a poverty-stricken widow, if they withdraw from the case and get sued by the other side.   The inexperienced lawyers argue the high-profile case against an impossible opponent, with an unsympathetic judge. \\"Thank God it's not me!\\" you think, your own problems paling in comparison.  The pace keeps going at top speed, with many twists and turns to a satisfying end.  Although several of the female characters - the opposing lawyer and David's wife - seem one-dimensional and not very believable, this story wasn't meant to be believable. It's a fun romp through the world of high-stakes litigation.
1419702238|3.0|This book is the sixth book of the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series. I'm 15 years old, and im proud to say i own all books, and i absolutely love each and every one of them! I was so excited to read this one, but i might have been a bit disappointed.<br />First of all, all of the series is a fun-fast read. They are all really funny, and even Juhina, yes Juhina, my 21 year old sister, loves them too. I felt like this book wasn't as funny as the first five. I just felt like it lacked the Greg spark, that always seemed to make the book hilarious. I guess there wasn't much funny interactions with his mom and dad and lil brother manny, which i loved reading about.<br />There isn't much to write about this book, since half of the book is pictures. So i really hope the next book will be funnier than this one.

B004W2UBYW|2.0|I am a fan of both Jobs and Isaacson but this book falls far short of being a quality work. Nothing new, repetitive, almost makes Jobs look kinda boring. My impression after reading this book? Jobs is a creative genius, a control freak not a perfectionist, the emotional development of a 16 yr old girl. If you have read other Jobs biographies you can skip this one.
0385534639|5.0|I have never been to a circus in my entire life; I know...sad, but after reading The Night Circus I feel like I fell right in the middle of the greatest circus on Earth. I think any circus I might attend would be an utter disappointment in comparison to the magic that unfolds in The Night Circus. The only way to describe Erin Morgenstern's world building is simply magical. Her descriptions are breathtaking and her characters are enigmatic and mysterious. Every piece of the circus comes alive: characters, food, exhibits, clothing, props, even the tents that house the circus. Ms. Morgenstern engages every sense in her prose, transporting you deep into another world.<br /><br />\\"The circus arrives without warning.\\" - opening line.<br /><br />These five words describe le Cirque des Reves better than any other grouping of words I can imagine. From that single sentence, you literally feel the mystery, danger, and intrigue that surrounds a marvel so odd that it simply roles into town unnoticed and suddenly appears in a glory unknown to any other event of this magnitude. I could go on and on about the writing, but perhaps I should tell you a little about the story.<br /><br />Marco and Celia have been pitted against each other since the age of six. Each of them go into this competition completely unaware of what is expected of them; only knowing that they are to use their \\"abilities\\" to best their opponent. Their creations are simply magnificent. The circus travels through the world during the late 1800's and early 1900's. Each year, the competition increases as does the romance. Every person, place, or thing is a machination of this unreal pairing. Winning this contest is not a simple as it would seem.<br /><br />Gosh, this book is so hard to explain. I think I will tell you about 5 of my favorite descriptions...<br /><br />*Midnight Dinners at la maison Lefevre - these dinner parties take place throughout the book, always including the most interesting characters and activities. Dinner is a series of courses, with the first being served precisely at midnight. Pre-dinner activities vary with every meeting; although, they always include some type of performance. Some of the dinners are more memorable than others.<br /><br />*The bonfire is essentially the heart of the circus, or at least half of it. I could see the bonfire being lit in its most ceremonious state, every arrow that flew, sparking the fire...enabling and protecting this awe-inspiring festival.<br /><br />*The clock made by Herr Friedrick Thiessen is magnificent. Ms. Morgenstern's description of this masterpiece enraptured me. I want one...literally. From its \\"dreamlike\\" existence, to the monochromatic coloring, to each action that is precisely synchronized with the ticking of time...it is magnanimous.<br /><br />*The Ice Garden. I think I could live here. All the beauty of nature perfectly preserved in ice without losing any of its essence, ever-existing, never melting...never dying. Sparkling and white, crystallized for eternity.<br /><br />*All Hallow's Eve at le Cirque des Reves. Visitors are encouraged to wear masks and partake in the revelry in some semblance of anonymity, observing each of the attractions in an entire different atmosphere. As you might imagine...All Hallow's Eve has a lore revolving around death and tragedy, bringing with it unfortunate circumstances.<br /><br />In all reality, I highly suggest you read this book. When you do...try to do it with as little outside stimulus as possible so you can fall head-over-heals into this mystical and dreamy book.rst being served precisely at midnight.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I did not like this book.  This is one time I hope that whomever writes the screenplay changes everything that was written in the book.  It was at times so confusing I had to go back and read whole sections over to get what happened. This book felt like an afterthought.  Was it written before the movie deal?  Poor way of storytelling the ravages of war.  Key issues  * The story sucked...not because of the war put her lame way of telling the war story. Who had any redeeming qualities? No one.  What happened to the characters we rooted for in the first books?  * Peeta treatment...really lost the whole essence of the character from the first two books.  Very poor treatment of a main character.   *Katniss -souless, dead inside, always someone's pawn  *Haymitch - just got lost in the shuffle of this horribly written story  *Prim - why bother discussing my issues as the author appeared to just toss her into the ending and gloss over so poorly what she symbolized in this whole trilogy.  *Snow - WTH kinda ending was that for him.  Poorly Poorly written  I really wish I'd stopped reading after the second book.  Feel cheated by the author  So glad I only paid $1.00 using KSO special offers.  It makes up for the time I wasted reading this book.
B0038YID1S|5.0|This is the first soundtrack I've ever owned where I can listen to the whole thing all the way through.

B003L77GGK|5.0|I've been hooked on \\"Supernatural\\" ever since I saw the very first episode, some six seasons ago.  It's a wonderful series full of ghosts, goblins, and a swarm of demons, straight from the gates of hell. I watched the entire Sixth Season in one weekend. I have a feeling that once you get started, it will be hard for you to stop, too. Each episode leaves you wanting for more. Don't hesitate, order this entire series today!

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using these headphones since I was young and I love them!  You can't beat the price.  I hate the ear bud kind because they give me headaches, maybe I just have a weird ear canal, but these fit perfectly, others around me can't hear a thing, and the sound is good.  They are not BOSE headphones, nor are they noise cancellation, but you can throw them in a bag, the plastic headband is VERY flexible, and they last for years.  Plus, at under $10, what more could you ask for?
1572814349|5.0|I was hesisitant at first with the artwork being of others, like the romanatic deck. However the artwork was a collage of works. I was pleasantly surprised. Though the cards do stick together at first, I didn't have m uch of a problem with them. The imagery is deep and thoughtful and very well done and also done in a way that may look traditional but isn't. The artwork was thoughtful. yes there is a lot of relegious symbolism but the era the deck protrayed was heavy with it and black does point that out throughout the consice and very helpful guidebook. Maybe not for rank beginers but certainly one worth looking into as intermeadte deck. Reoommoneced for collectors as well, there is an exhaustive resource as to what paintings were used.

The story line is better and it's got a lot more action in it. The characters are perfect. Damon is is probably my favorite and I think most others would agree. He's the icing on the cake. I can actually say this is the best show I have watched in a long time and people of all ages would enjoy it.

1451627289|2.0|If you want to travel back in time to the early 1960s to read about some guy being swept off his feet at a high school in Texas, read this book. However, if you're looking for a fantastical, imaginative look from America's foremost science fiction writer at what might have happened if someone had been able to go back in time to Nov. 22, 1963 and alter American history, you've come to the wrong place. Really, Mr. King? Really? I read all those pages and my payoff was a last-minute race up the stairs of the TSBD? If I wanted to read a love story I'd read the latest from Lavenia Kent. Who??? Exactly. Do better.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Too many plot holes and unnecesary character flaws... like how the protagonist, &quot;Jesus&quot;, is a zombie and he's also his own father, who's also all-powerful and all knowing but needs a lot of attention or elso he turns into a total prick. There's better monsters and heros in the old greek myths.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite of Rush's work.  I started rocking with Rush right before the release of Moving Pictures, and still had not heard this album.  Because every album Rush has produced is unique, it's tough to rate them.  I spent a lot of deep listening with Permanent Waves and Hemispheres, and this one is just as ear-catching.  If you love Rush, you'll love Farewell to Kings, too.  I believe it's the album right before Hemispheres, judging from the story-line...keep it close to your heart--ha ha.
B005FITIGO|4.0|\\"I was working on something but they wouldn't let me finish, so take a look at it...be careful.\\" The investment banking firm that Eric Dale (Tucci) works at it under hard times. After a day of firing most of his floor Eric is also let go. On his way out he give a project he is working on to young banker Peter (Quinto). After looking at his project and finishing his problem he is left with a dangerous discovery. This movie takes place in a 24 hour period during the beginnings of the economic meltdown that occurred in the country. This movie, much like \\"Company Men\\" is a very important movie to watch, and will infuriate you while you watch. While it says it's not based on a true story I have a feeling most of it is probably true. This movie deals with a banking firm that held mortgages and it came out that their formula was wrong for capital holdings and ruined the firm. Rather then coming forward with their problems the CEO decides to sell off the useless stock. To me, while watching this movie I kept getting more and more angry to the point of laughing and scoffing at the TV. That may just be how I feel about it, but this is a must see movie that will leave you talking and thinking. Overall, one of the best movies of the year, and probably a pretty accurate story of what happened. I give it an A.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I found that the DVD was one of the most violent chapters in the Harry Potter series but considering that Part 1 was in the kindest words that I can use dull but this Part more than made up for it, but seeing that this was the END, it was an anticlimax, but seeing that I own all of the others in the series I had no other choice. As a FYI the purchasers of this DVD may have, like me wanted it to be over, to state Mr. Shakespeare \\"Brevity is the soul of whit\\" or the soul of any good writing.  Note: I don't blame the writer, I do blame the studio.

B004X80QNG|5.0|Looks like a Palm TX!  (I loved that thing).  Really refreshing, I've tried most of the calendars, and it's the first android calendar I've seen that makes sense.  Synched up instantly to Exchange Outlook and about four Google calendars.  Not 100% perfect, there are a few minor things I'd suggest to the developers, but for me this is well on its way to finally being a replacement to the stock calendar.
B0027WNRIG|5.0|Anybody worth their salt who experienced Pyromania during its initial run back in 1983 knows that this album is one of the tent poles of 80's music period!  Finally remastered, and repackaged with live tracks, the definitive Def Leppard experience is available the way it should be.  This album should be on anyone's short list who loves 80's music, heavy metal, hard rock, or British New Wave.  It is melodic and driving at the same time.  The production is fantastic.  Vocals, guitar work, and percussion are all tight, and polished.  This is everything a rock and roll experience should be.

B003L77GG0|5.0|It came in the mail really fast, which is nice cause it's an x-mas present, brand new! No complaints, happy client!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down for very long. The wolf creatures really surprised me.  I definelty didn't see that coming. I didn't like the ending but, I guess I will just have to read the 2nd book!
B000K7UG34|5.0|Mel Gibson was at his best doing this movie. According to my Vietnam Vet buddies, this was pretty realistic. This was one hell of a battle.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|It is sad to think this is the last one in the series.  I was very pleased with the coverage of the contents of the book except would liked to have seen Neville as Headmaster greeting the students to wrap it up.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This was a sad but great movie showing what really happened in Africa. We, Americans, should learn from this experience, not to underestimate the enemy and to make sure we have enough support to do the job right.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|I thought Steven Wilson did an excellent job remixing one of my favorite albums. This is a new mix not just a remastering of the old mix. It brought out elements of the music I hadn't truly noticed before.
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|There was quite a bit of vulgarity in this movie in some parts, but I started watching the movie expecting there would be, especially since Danny McBride is in it.  That fact aside though, if you can get past that, this movie is actually pretty funny and a lot of fun to watch.  Basically what it boils down to is this...if you like to laugh and don't mind a bit of vulgarity, check this one out!  'Nough said!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Very interesting ideas and studies to seemingly back it up. Have tried the weight gain (muscle growth) and weight loss (no carb) and found both of them worked like a charm! Very likeable author, pitched at a goldilocks level (Just Right) and well written.

0307888681|5.0|I can't stand most zombie movies games and books because they focus on violence and gore to scare you this book takes a different approach it looks at how everyday people, governments and even the International Space Station react and adapt to a zombie apocalypse and it manages to freak you out in a different more in depth way for instance I never new missiles would be mostly useless against zombies and I never thought of what would happen to those that enter the ocean. The authors claims are even backed up by cited facts making the book more realistic and interesting. Hopefully a movie is made from this book because too much gore and violence dominate Hollywood as of now.
0060007737|3.0|What is a brand? Is it a name? A logo? A funky design or attitude? A brand is a symbol for an idea. More specifically, a brandname is a word that can be uttered in any country, in any `language' and mean the same thing. If a company is consistent and strong in repeating the same message over and over, in time, its brandname will become synonymous with an idea. If the company keeps changing its stripes, the name never catches on, and means nothing. McDonalds is about Family Food. Subway is about Fresh. Pepsi is about Fun<br /><br />If you get really good at this, as a Brand Manager, and you create a brand new product and its name can describe an entire category. A few examples of unbeatable brandnames often mistaken for actual words:Xerox.Band-Aid.RollerBlade. Even the iPod for a time was the `placeholder' word that meant `Digital Music Player'.<br /><br />Moreover, brands are not only synonymous with ideas, they're synonymous with colors. Again, this only works if, after decades of promotion, the company has been consistent:Coca Cola is Red. IBM is Blue. John Deere is Green<br /><br />The list here is short, because frankly, many companies screw this up. They pick the wrong color. They don't pick a color. They pick two colors. Pepsi, though a very successful company, foolishly picked Red and Blue as their colors when going up against the Red of Coca Cola (the leader in the market). Obviously, they should have just gone with deep Blue. They figured it out eventually, but they're still stuck with a blue and red logo. Oops.<br /><br />Not only are companies brands, but people are brands too:<br /><br />How can a man or woman have a strong brand? Stephen King has a brand (though recently he's moved away from horror). Stanley Kubrick had one. So did Steve Jobs. Kobe Bryant and Lebron James have brands too (you have to actually have a brand before you can get paid to put it on a shoe or T-shirt, by the way). Anna Kournikova used to have a brand, but she doesn't play tennis anymore.<br /><br />These are names. And these are people who at some point in their lives were the first at doing something. They found their niche and they excelled. They achieved tremendous success often at a young age.<br /><br />And yes, People can have colors. In the latter half of his career, Steve Jobs was almost never seen (even by his family) without his signature black mock turtleneck. Remember Eminem's white T-shirt and dyed hair? Same thing. When Eminem went away from that, he largely went away from the spotlight. He's basically a producer now.<br /><br />How do you build your corporate and personal brand? Surprisingly, it's not done with ads. In a bit of brilliant irony, most people watching TV (eg. Superbowl ads) assume that advertisements are trying to push a companies products and brands to growth. After all, don't we hear about a company for the first time, when their new product comes out?<br /><br />No. Wrong. That might be what some short-lived companies are trying to do, but that's not possible. The only way to grow is through publicity. And how do you get publicity? How do you get in the New York Times and Financial Post? You get there by being the first and the best. Only when you've achieved something of this stature do you start advertising-not to grow marketshare, but to maintain marketshare you already have. Maybe that's why Amazon.com doesn't need to advertise. And up until recently, Microsoft Windows didn't need advertising either. How could these two companies advertise when they seemed to have no competitors?<br /><br />So look at your own career right now: are you the best in the city at anything? Best in the Country? Best in the world? How can you be number 1 at something? Shrink your focus until you are number one.<br /><br />So, how do you grow? By always being #1, not by growing so much beyond your niche that you're no longer number one. Read that last line again. Look at Amazon: they used to be the worlds biggest bookstore. Now they're calling themselves `Earth's Biggest Selection'. Kinda vague and...is it even true? Probably. But it also means now they're competing against... Wal-Mart. Was that the original Amazon brand? Buying clothes and electronics? No way. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is very smart, so he can probably pull it off, but it also leaves room for other companies to swoop in and focus on books. That's probably what the guys at Barnes and Noble are telling themselves.<br /><br />Hopefully, you don't have to worry about competitors like Amazon. Hopefully you don't have to worry about what color their logo is, and what their market share is, because hopefully your company, your product (and your ideas and your personality) are so good that you don't have to own a current market, because you created a new one and own that.<br /><br />More reviews like this on 21tigeralso means now they're competing against...

1419702238|5.0|\\"I believed, therefore I spoke, 'I am greatly afflicted.'\\" -- Psalm 116:10 (NKJV)<br /><br />Jeff Kinney has done it again! He has an amazing ability to reach back into childhood to remember the perspective we all had and to revive memories of Christmas, winter, bullying, online activities, \\"solutions\\" that didn't work out so well, having to help parents, and starting little enterprises. I felt as if I were there with Greg in many cases.<br /><br />Even better, his portrayal of Greg as being hapless . . . but not quite knowing it . . . is especially appealing. There's some of Greg in all of us, and Jeff Kinney obviously appreciates the naivet&eacute; while letting us all enjoy some good laughs that are almost as much at our own expense as they are at Greg's.<br /><br />Finally, Jeff Kinney understands the frequent silliness of the world . . . when we \\"believe\\" in what we are supposed to believe. In so doing, there's a cautionary tale here to ask questions first.<br /><br />Bravo!
B002MW50KO|5.0|I bought this CD a few weeks ago, and I wasn't impressed at first.    I am a fan of Bob Dylan (from Freewheelin' to Infidels to Highway 61 to Love and Theft, etc. etc.) and I am a fan of Christmas music (from Vince Guaraldi to Phil Spector to James Brown to Elvis and Frank and Connie and Dean and etc. etc.) so I was *really* READY for a Bob Dylan Christmas album.  But, what I found after listening to this CD a couple of times with headphones on is that it is NOT a headphone album, it's a ROOMFUL album.  I played it this morning over regular old stereo speakers in a room full of people, and it really opened up.  It was like having the coolest uncle in the world plainly singing along to the greatest band and greatest backing vocalists in the world.    It would be like YOU or ME singing along to the greatest band and greatest backing singers in the world.  It would make us stretch out and make a truly awesome Christmas album, without the normal strings attached.  Wouldn't that be awesome?    ISN'T that awesome?  Regards,  V.

Miss Peregrine's ... is that rare book that may be more appealing to adults than to its intended readers.<br /><br />The use of the unusual photographs is simply masterful and provides an eerie and intriguing context for the story that mere words could not match.<br /><br />The plot had enough unexpected twists and turns in it to hold my attention and to make me keep reading rapidly to the end, almost as though I were reading an adult thriller.<br /><br />Normally, I'm quite critical of how natural and supernatural are combined in such stories, but Miss Peregrine's ... seemed to work quite well for me.<br /><br />I could see a major series being developed from this book ... and I can hardly wait to read it.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Riggs!
0307595579|5.0|Great trilogy.  The first book was a little slow in the beginning. It definitely picks up and the book becomes a heart pounding terrifying read.   My favorite book out of the three would have to be the girl who played with fire. I also secretly love Lisbeth and I don't think the Swedish version captures her as well but she is still a babe.   Anywho, I feel like I have jumped off topic.    The books are hardcover and they come in this sweet black cardboard holder. The fourth book about Stieg I can do without; maybe when I am bored I'll read through it. I solely miss not having any cover art but looking at my friend's book, I don't really think I'm missing out on much.  The books came quickly and were read just as quickly.    Booyah, if you haven't experienced this awesomeness, get on it. Just...get on it.
B006J38144|4.0|As far as season finales go I was left wanting more but it seemed only appropriate for the next (final?) season. Yes, I would have loved to see Clay shredded by Jax but I'm sure he will get his next season. This season was great.

B005LJK3AC|2.0|I did laugh in a few parts, but most parts were way too vulgar.  It takes a lot to offend me, and some of the language (or I guess more the way things were said) was very over the edge - almost like they were trying too hard.  I would not watch this again or recommend it to anyone.
0385535139|5.0|Loved the Chicago setting. Hopefully Grisham has more stories in the future that take place in big cities for a change. This one was a quick read that was hard to put down. I quickly bought it when I saw a WSJ review that wasn't very favorable. Unlike them, I liked the characters, took a while, but in the end I really did. Again, I hope he continues to give us insights into the makings of big city and federal court systems.

B003YGSLDA|4.0|This movie should be considered a Christmas classic, along with any version of A Christmas Carol and Miracle on 34th Street. It is widely enjoyable by both children and adults, especially due to Dudley Moore's appeal. Great (for the time) fly by's of NY. Great moral message. Plus, it will make your children REALLY believe in Santa. I have knocked down one star because the box falsely claims to have English subtitles. It does not. It does have German subtitles. The wording was AT BEST deceptively chosen on the box. Shame on the manufacturer for doing this, particularly on a Christmas movie! I have partial hearing loss so not having subtitles does greatly detract from my viewing experience. Plus, correctly spelled subtitles on an interesting movie make for a wonderful learning aid for kids. So, shame on you for ruining an otherwise perfect Blu-ray. Oh yeah, picture transfer quality is the best I've seen for a 25 year old film. Sound is only stereo, but then I don't know what the original sound mix was.

B0002F6BRE|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he's too in the realm of 19yr-old guy over-the-top obnoxious toilet humor. But i do love Christmas movies, and I was pleasantly surprised with his portrayal of Buddy the Elf. There is some of his characteristic mannerisms/joke delivery/etc but it's pretty toned down for him. It's a cute movie for the whole family, will help you get into the Christmas spirit, and is a unique diversion from the standards you've watched every year since you were 6. For the price, you can't go wrong. It's light and charming and will make all but the nastiest Scrooge smile.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a beautifully written novel.  It was the cover that drew me into this magically dark and light novel, but it was the story that held me there...  Even though the words are written in black ink on white paper or e Ink on my kindle as it were, the story is full of all the colors that you could imagine and some that you could not.  I did not want it to end...  I was so enthralled in the complexity of the inner workings of the story, it was like being a part of something you had to remember was not reality...  Isn't that what a book should be, a story that takes you away for a while...to live in the midst of the story, to linger there for a time, until you realize that you really need to get on with your day.  Well \\"The Night Circus\\" did exactly that for me.  Bravo!
B005B19UPE|5.0|This was an excellent book whose story was told in a unique way, as it talked about the past and encompassed the present. It made you realize the horror of the holcaust through the experiences of different families, both those who perished and those who survived.  I highly recommend it.
0439023513|2.0|I loved the first two novels. Actually, the second half of Catching Fire was my favorite (it was less stressful reading about older people fighting to the death than young, fearful kids). Mockingjay was a huge disappointment. Instead of feeling hope after finishing the last page, I felt depressed and deflated. The author didn't seem to put too much effort in the ending or the whole Katniss/Peeta/Gale love triangle.    People bring up the point that this book is realistic, that it shows us the devastating effects of war and senseless killing--and that PTSD will ruin your life. My parents, and even my oldest brother, have PTSD. They are survivors of the 1970's Cambodian Killing Fields. My parents had to watch people who helped them survive die at the hands of the Khmer Rouge for 3-4 years. They lived through hell, they have nightmares and occasional flash backs now. But instead of letting what happened in the past destroy their lives, my family came out strong. They don't feel depressed in their day to day living--they feel grateful for a sense of peace and not having to live in fear in their daily lives. My parents have four grandchildren, their children went to college, grad school, got good jobs, etc. My father is content with his gardening, taking care of their cats, watching baseball and football. My mom loves to socialize and be the life of a party. For some people, when they experience something horrific, they turn it around and instead of being depressed and fearful they are even more grateful than ever of the small things--like having enough food, having your family and loved ones around. I know not all survivors of genocide or war are as resilient and succumb to drugs, alcohol, depression. I just pictured Katniss as being one of those who pulled out strong and made something good out of the horror she experienced. I wished she gave us the sense of hope, that her world and children are okay. Instead, I get the sense that her kids will develop mental health issues (generational depression) and that her world is bleak. Katniss voice just seemed so depressing--so void of hope.  If you want to read well written and thought out dystopian books, try Louise Lawrence's \\"Children of the Dust\\" or Margaret Atwood's \\"Oryx and Crake.\\"
B004UQPM4E|4.0|It's an awesome collection for any body that truly enjoys a good superhero movie. Give it as a gift or keep it for yourself.
0553582038|5.0|This book has many bad reviews and I understand. Many readers of the series, fans that have been faithfull to these books since they first came out and were hooked on the first three were sore when they had to wait for several long years (was it 5?) before this one came along. It must have been an exercise in patience difficult to withstand.  But if you are new to the series (like me) and are only just taking it up and have the opportunity to read books one to five one after the other, then you wont be dissapointed. This book focuses on only half of the characters and some new ones. The plot is advanced for each of these characters, things happen, unexpected things, characters are developed in surprising ways. Previously unsavory characters become more likable and viceversa. Nothing is resolved but, for me this is good. I much prefer the journey than actually getting there. And I predict that the next books will be like this one, I certainly hope so. I wouldnt want the plot to be resolved just yet. I expect lots of entretaining reading for many years to come. And if by chance or accident the series is never resolved then I am greatfull for these books we have, they are great, they surprised me in a very good way, the writer is inteligent, cunning, a Tyrion, he keeps on coming up with new and unexpected surprises and nothing is yet resolved so I am now looking forward to reading the fifth book and I know the sixth will most probably be a long time coming and it will most likely not resolve any of the plots but that is for the best. As I said before  the journey is much better than getting there, the ending will most liklely be an anticlimax.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|A film by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, story by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish and starring Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig and Pegg & Frost. Sounds good, doesn't it? But 'ware! The subject is one of the most cherished icons of 20th century child's story-telling, held dear by pretty much anyone of a \\"certain age\\" and transferred from a distinctive style to modern CGI animation. The potential to fail is strong in this one...<br /><br />Briefly, the story is a mash-up of three well known episodes in the Tintin canon, The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure. Tintin (Bell) meets Captain Haddock (Serkis) and embark on an action packed search for the Captain's ancestor's treasure trove. They are joined by two of the more fondly remembered of Tintin's associates, Thompson and Thomson played by Pegg and Frost, (or is it Frost and Pegg?) and stalked by arch criminal Ivan Sakharine (Craig).<br /><br />The film is produced using performance capture animation and it bridges the gap between a live action film and the straight \\"cartoon\\" of the Bernasconi animated series. Obviously Tintin purists will have their objections as the film does take *some* liberties with the \\"look\\", but to the ordinary audience member, the end product is both impressive and reverential to Herge. If there are any objections to the CGI animation (and there are a few minor ones) I think it's important to remember that the art and technology of CGI is still developing and it would be churlish to criticise too strongly. One criticism I have heard is that the emotional expression of the characters suffers in the CGI process. I'll have none of that! The characters' faces are expressive and readable and it is quite easy eventually to forget that they *are* CGI and my wife came out of the cinema remarking that the make-up was very good and she didn't recognise Andy Serkis at all!<br /><br />Most importantly, the animation really does keep the faith with Herge's vision (Herge even appears in a small cameo in the opening sequence) in almost every way. The characters are depicted as 3D versions of his original ligne claire artwork (without the lignes) and it's a big relief that the story is set in the 1940's Tintin universe, \\"somewhere in Europe\\", plus-fours, bowler hats, rusty tramp-steamers, schmeisser machine guns and sea-planes galore. The film really retains the film noir \\"feel\\" of the original and that will be important to Tintin's fans. The \\"scenery\\" is, like Herge's comics, sumptuously populated and I was crying out for a remote control to pause and rewind the film so that I could revisit some of the little details that I half-missed - the covers of magazines carelessly tossed onto desktops, the contents of the desk's partly opened drawers, little cameo sequences that take place at the edge of the screen while the main action is front and centre, the array of faces in The Milanese Nightingale's audience and so-on. The film has *huge* rewatch potential and I will be pre-ordering the DVD as soon as it becomes available for this reason alone!<br /><br />The acting is brilliant and all the performers really bring their characters to life. Bell does a fine job and Serkis and Pegg and Frost convey their slapstick antics extremely well. It's good that the actors' performances don't overwhelm the characters' already well-developed personalities. While I've heard some criticism that Serkis overcooks his Haddock, I disagree - the Captain is a larger-than-life personality and Serkis does a fine job with this wonderful character. I am aching, however, to meet Professor Calculus in a sequel (please let it be Destination Moon)!<br /><br />Ol' Steve has been around a while, now and knows a thing or too about the action/adventure genre and he really lets rip with this one. Indiana Jones for kids? I'll say. The action is breath-taking and at nearly two hours in length it's a rollercoaster ride. The motorcycle chase scene, filmed in a single continuous take is the centrepiece of the film. Spielberg bundles you into the sidecar and takes you on a break-neck race, bouncing you off the walls, leaping chasms and leaving you, several minutes later, sitting in a small cloud of dust with steam coming off the seat of your pants and little cork-screws of sweat radiating off your head. The \\"Long Take\\" scene is becoming a bit of a cliche in modern cinematography and, I think, looks a little ostentatious in live action film, but in animation it works rather well and left me exhausted and deeply satisfied.

B001AG52AG|2.0|Generally an undeniably visually stunning film, sumptuous in appearance, but look a little closer and the CGI is just too obvious - the film almost feels like a cartoon in that respect. Worse still, the film is killed by an unseemly rush to get from the first page of the book to the last. The story is compressed to the point of ridiculousness and, much as the fans of the book would have hated a more ruthless abridgement, it would have been better to have lost /sections/ of the story rather than to try to cram them all into a 2 hour playing time as the director, scriptwriter and editor have done here. It really makes a travesty of an epic, rich and detailed story. Contrast this with Peter Jackson's seamless treatment of the even more immense LotR trilogy.<br /><br />The acting is barely acceptable, despite the all star cast - no-one really seems to care about their characters. Disappointing, really - Ian McKellen is just a big teddy bear, Jim Carter is capable of far better, Sam Elliot is... well, Sam Elliot again, really, and Dan Craig should probably stick to his Bond character (d'you see what I did there? Stick to... Bond. I crack myself up. Really I do.)<br /><br />This is one to pass over, I'm afraid.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|This has been a great series, and the third season is no exception. If you liked one and two...you'll like this one as well.  Enjoy!
B000O14VAU|5.0|OK, so it ain't high art and you don't need me to tell you what it's about. This is a vampire/werewolf movie for heaven's sake! It's sexy, stylish, gory and fantastic fun. Vampires and werewolves locked in eternal conflict! It's got Kate Beckinsale in skin-tight PVC, driving a Maserati. Martin Sheen chews up the scenery and spits it out in a mouthful of blood and gore; there's an actor called Kevin Grevioux and another one called Shane Brolly! What more could anyone want?<br /><br />...well, how about Bill Nighy?<br /><br />Bill Nighy! It's worth it just for him. Just when the film looks like it's taking itself rather too seriously, Bill is resurrected from the (un)dead, wanting to know...<br /><br />\\"...what's - this - ruckus?\\" What a classic line :D<br /><br />This is proper vampire/werewolf fare and it leaves Edward and Bella twitching and gurgling in a puddle of their own steaming entrails, shimmering feebly as their life force ebbs (thankfully) into the dust.<br /><br />As you can probably tell, I reckon it's not too bad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game works well with Kindle Fire.  It wild provide hours of entertainment.  An excellent game for all ages. I highly recommend it
B000MPEIF6|5.0|This film (and more generally the series of films) does seem to attract its fair share of opprobrium and, looking at the spread of ratings it's got here on Amazon, it's not even just a \\"love it or loathe it\\" film - it's pretty much fairly covered by every point on the spectrum. One fairly common theme of the \\"hate it\\" reviews appears to be that it offends devotees of the computer game from which the film series originated. Only having played RE on the PS1 once, I personally have no concept of whether the transfer to celluloid has been appalingly botched but, in any case, I think that it's a little unfair: there can't be many films that were able to faithfully reproduce the game/book/comic/etc from which it was derived. Similarly, another common theme is that it's some sort of failed pretender to the Romero throne. Again, I haven't seen any of his films (I did see the Dawn remake) so I am unlikely to be offended on that score either.<br /><br />Oh well, enough of that. I am one of this film's fans. Let me say up front that I realise that it has some fairly fundamental believability problems. However, if you hang your belief on the peg at the door and accept the film for what it really /is/ and ignore the director/producer/actor waffle on the \\"Making of\\" documentary about how they loved playing the game and wanted to reproduce the experience in the cinema then there should be no reason to really hate the film. And what it really is, is a zombie flick for the 21st century. Pure, simple and unambiguous. It has all the elements. A dwindling cast of \\"survivors\\" are trapped or confined in an environment that is literally crawling with the undead. Cue heroics, treachery, an enormous body-count and an ordnance expenditure that would shame the US Army. It's not all guns, though and the more usual means of zombie-disposal - decapitation by means of a handy fire-axe, iron pipe or simple neck-twist - is preserved for the pleasure of the traditionalists.<br /><br />The story is admirably supported by the gorgeous Ms Jovovich, complete in knee-length boots and a strappy red dress, who literally kicks ass. She is ably assisted by a SWAT team which includes Colin Salmon, and Michelle Rodriguez adds a little more killer-chick eye-candy to the ensemble. Eric Mabius and James Purefoy also tag along, but the film is really all about Mila and the zombies and that is, perhaps, where the film suffers a little. This central theme is diluted by all the trappings of the computer game that the director felt he had to squeeze in: the all-powerful Umbrella Corporation, the computer system gone bad, the theft of the zombie virus and some nonsense about genetically engineered creatures (\\"Lickers\\" I think? and in the second film the Nemesis creature) on the loose. I suppose that some viewers may also fret that there is a bit too much of the leading lady and not enough zombie peril, but I have always been of the opinion that you can't ever see too much of Mila Jovovich (and you can parse that statement however you like).<br /><br />Overall, the film works for me. I would never call myself a zombie connoiseur but, with some minor reservations, this does its job very nicely. There are plenty of shocks and thrills, an elegant sufficiency of gore and you can play the \\"who gets it next and how?\\" game with your friends. Bargain! The zombies themselves are well executed (actually, that's quite a good double-entendre, isn't it?) and the setting is suitably claustrophobic: indeed, being set in an underground research facility (\\"The Hive\\") does lend the film an constricted, linear, escape-down-this-corridor feel to it that actually recalls the game series quite nicely.<br /><br />Perhaps then that is where the film fails (in a small way): it's trying too hard to satisfy two different audiences, the gamers and the Romero fans, but ends up being a compromise and maybe (just maybe) the people who will get the most out of the film are those (like me) who fall into neither category.<br /><br />I tend to be quite free and easy with my 5 star ratings but, in this case, I feel justified. This film is one that I frequently return to regardless that the shocks and surprises generally don't anymore and my copy will never find its way to a car boot sale.<br /><br />\\"All the people that were working here are dead.\\"<br />\\"Well, that isn't stopping them from walking around.\\"sy with my 5 star ratings but, in this case, I feel justified.

0545123275|5.0|I loved this book, the next two are amazing as well! This book is almost like a play off of Twilight but with only wolves and the love that grows between human and wolf is amazing, almost makes me wish this trilogy was made into a movie as well!
0446573019|5.0|This book met and exceeded expectations.  The action was nonstop and the ending had some unexpected twists.  I found the depiction of West Virginia and its people quite believable and accurate. The premise of the nuclear facility had huge holes in it, but it still made for and exciting story.  One of the most entertaining book I've read in the last year.
0143105426|4.0|I am decidedly not a fan of Austen, but my boyfriend specifically asked for this edition for Christmas. It is part of an excellent series of Penguin Classics that are being re-released with superb cover art. Normally cover art bears only a fleeting relation to the actual content of the book, but the covers in this series are all very fitting for their books. The pages are nicely weighty, and the cover art continues on the inside flaps of the cover.
B004X80QNG|4.0|I thought this was a great app at first glance so I downloaded it an then read the reviews,  which didnt seem all that great. After using it for a while though,  it works great and is so easy to read and follow. I'm not a person who likes a ton of choices so I get overwhelmed at all the customizable optioms PI offers. It syncs perfectly with my gcal and gtasks so I have no idea what people mean by this app not syncing with google calendar/tasks. I highly recommend it.  It even offers an option to sync with msoutlook.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|Great movie and I love action. This movie is full of action. Chris Evans makes a great Captain America. You get right behind the character. Tommy Lee Jones is great also.
0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games reminded me how much I love to read, specifically, how much I loved to read when I was a young adult. The world that's created by Suzanne Collins acts as an interesting introduction to dystopian literature for young adult youth (reminscent of Margaret Atwood, etc). I couldn't put it down once I started, and promptly ordered the second and third book within the week. This is an incredible series, with a lot of great and provoking themes for youth to pick up on and adults to appreciate. There's romance, there's questions of morality, and it challenges us as readers to wonder, what would you do in this kind of world? What's right and what's wrong? As Katniss questions her own morals and choices, you can't help but join her, and I believe this is such an important thing for a book to do for its readers. Which is why I adore this series and highly recommend it to anyone who likes to read.
0273710516|4.0|Great logic ideas how to structure your notes, mails or long essays! However language used and complicated examples given to explain ideas make getting the concepts very frustrating.    The book describes very good basics how to structure your ideas - starting with story telling concepts, putting ideas first, applying pyramid concept to summarize your points and support main ideas etc.    On the other hand the author loves using not frequently used words and jargon combined with excessive use of passive voice. This makes comprehending the ideas very difficult, especially for me, non-native English speaker. On top of these difficulties, examples used in the book are mostly way too technical that just understanding what is it all about completely distracts from absorbing the idea. I think if the ideas of the book is targeted to general public, language and examples should be so understandable that the reader easily focuses just on the main concepts.    In summary, the book is full of great ideas very useful for any writer. Just the difficult wording makes you re-read the text couple of times to get to the roots. And be prepared for tough examples...
B0055Q5F36|5.0|Like a glove.  I have Otterbox commuter series cases on all my cell phones and ipods.  I find these are the lightest and least bulky protective cases and provide adequate protection when my gizmos are dropped.  You can throw away the screen protector cause it ain't gonna fit.  As one reviewer noted, the screen layout on the AT&T S II is not the same as the screen protector provided with this case.

B005G4TJI4|3.0|This film makes an awesome *Blu-Ray*.  I would not have purchase it otherwise.<br /><br />If I could I combine my score for the film (2) and my score for the Blu-Ray (5), I'd give it a 3.<br /><br />So starting with the good, this film have great visuals.  This third entry in the series has really refined the CGI established in the first film.  The \\"graphics\\" look great especially in slow motion.  The special effects are for the most part seamless and very sharp.  There is so much that goes on in the third act in the movie that you can completely skip the first two thirds of the film just to see what in my mind are the most valuable parts in the film.  I watched this on a 120HZ TV with the \\"Smooth Motion\\" effect on.  If you have this feature it makes for a great viewing experience for this film.<br /><br />Of course in an action movie like this you get amazing sound as well.  Transformers 3 makes excellent use of surround sound.  Just watch the opening prologue and the title card sequence and you'll see what I mean.  It's easier for me to rate video rather than sound so I'm not sure what else to add here.  It will make great use of all of your speakers is what I can say.<br /><br />Transformers 3 is bad.  I like mindless popcorn films like Bad Boys II, Independence Day, Battle Los Angeles, and even the first Transformers.  I also like \\"so bad it's good\\" films; Wicker Man, Rocky IV, or Armageddon which kind of falls in between.  This film does not fall into either category for me.  It's neither a fluid popcorn film nor an ironic masterpiece.  I'll explain why.<br /><br />Entertainment.  If I can watch a film from start to finish without being bored then that's mission accomplished on some level.  There's a large chunk of the first half of the film that deals with some fact-finding and conspiracy theory.  Although there's a little action thrown in, I absolutely did not care for this whole part of the movie.  Thing weren't worth watching until Chicago is mentioned.  Ifyou've seen the movie you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />The acting ranges from decent to good albeit a little over the top at times but this is mostly for comedic relief.  The characters were just not fun which again lowered the entertainment factor.  Most were just irritating and pointless.  I wish they had not brought back John Turturro or introduced Frances McDormand.  The second film already had the government officials acting as obstacles to the Transformers.  Introducing a really cold character lacking personality did nothing for me it was just a dislikable character and not in the cool Sylar from \\"Heroes\\" sort of way.  You'll notice these two also don't take part in the outstanding action scenes which show just how much you need these characters.<br /><br />Speaking of useless characters, Rose Huntington-Whiteley is the love interest replacing Megan Fox and really the only example of truly bad acting in the film.  I felt this movie really didi not need a damsel in distress aspect.  After two films we're introduced to some strange woman with no established history and suddenly she's presented as the soul mate of our protagonist and also the centerpiece to the whole Chicago adventure (SPOILER: the main reason our heroes travel to Chicago is to save her).  Again, I don't think they needed John Tuturro or his butler.  The film wisely reduced the part of the parents which should have been done all around to shorten the boring parts.  The soldiers played by Josh Duhamel, Tyreese Gibson, and a few others are also in the film just so the Decepticons have someone too shoot at them and create explosions.  The plane jumping sequence was very cool though.<br /><br />On the upside we have a character who I will not name for spoiler reasons.  I think it should have been established early on in the series that the Decepticons might have humans working for them.  This is shown early in the film during the exposition.  I think having an opposite to the Sam character shouldhave been established in the second film if not the first and could have been interested to watch that character's journey which would culminate in a showdown in the 3rd film.<br /><br />Finally, this movie did not feature the Transformers enough.  It's bad enough they used overcomplicated designs that strayed from the original Transformers (Optimus Prime being sort of the only exception) but we also don't get enough scenes where we see the robots interacting.  They're merely used for the action.  The scene where the Autobots are sneaking around Sam's house in part 1 and the desert meeting Megatron has with Sound Wave and Star Scream in part 3 are some of my favorite parts in the series.  It just feels like this is what Transformers should've been more about from a story perspective.<br /><br />All that aside.  This is a great *Blu-Ray* to own and I will be keeping it in my collection.  It'll be nice to whip out every once in a while and kind of ignore in the background until that third act comes up.  At that point I'll take a seat and turn the volume up to high.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a very good game. solid 4 stars. great graphics and story. would be 5 if it was a bit longer.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I have to be honest that I really wasn't expecting this to be as great as it was. But, I'm so glad I gave it a chance because it is one of my favorite movies of 2011. Great story, action, acting and Kenneth Branagh did an excellent job directing this movie. Too bad he won't be back to direct the sequel because he seemed to really get the characters.<br /><br />As far as the 3D goes though, it was pretty FLAT. I'm not a big fan of \\"converted\\" 3D and this movie is a pretty good example of why. Sure there were a couple of scenes with some pretty good depth, but most of the film was pretty flat.

B003L77G8I|4.0|I'm not one for reviewing but I will say the first half of season 6 was unexpected (both a positively/negative thing) and occasionally disappointing, even a bit of a bummer. But the bright side, the 2nd half. The later episodes were eventful and everything entertaining that the BONES team is capable of putting together.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|Can we all say Single White Female anyone?<br /><br />All this was, was a young version of SWF, but none of these actors in this film have the acting chops of Bridgette Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh.<br /><br />This movie was nothing but trash at its finest. You get more excitement out of reading a phone book than watching this train wreck of a film. Makes no sense that this Rebecca bitch already acting like a stick up her ass the moment Sara introduces her to the other two girls (Michalka & Graham). Already having the psycho act like a complete douche within the first ten minutes of the film with no development of the friendship is just lazy ass writing by the idiots who wrote this garbage.<br /><br />We can compare a lot to SWF. Instead of adopting a dog, they adopt a cat. Instead of the psycho's sister being dead the lead character's sister is dead. The psycho confronts lead on where she been just like in SWF. Teacher makes the moves on lead character just like what happened to Fonda in SWF, instead of getting a makeover to look like her, she gets the exact same tattoo, and the ultimate scene stealer is the bedroom scene. She dresses up like the girl and goes to ex-boyfriend's room and kills him with a knife instead of a high heel shoe. You barely even hear about this ex-boyfriend in this film. Even the death of psycho is retarded just like in the movie SWF, sharp object to the back.<br /><br />Billy Zane & Aly Michalka's characters just disappear just for the sake of vanishing. This movie makes no sense, doesn't even bother to make sense. All this movie was about was pretty people walking around trying to look hip and trendy.
1899618740|4.0|Yes, I was surprised at the small size of this book when I received it, but it is still a very cool book. The book includes a tear-out page of clear plastic with an evenly spaced series of parallel black lines; when you slide this tear-out page over the images in the book, it creates an amazing optical illusion of movement. When sliding the tear-out page, be careful to keep the bottom of the tear-out page parallel to the bottom of the page with the image; if the tear-out page is rotated while sliding, it reduces the optical illusion; this may be difficult for young children.  This method of creating the optical illusion of movement has been known for a long time, but to the best of my knowledge, this 2007 book is the first book in the past 50 years to use this type optical illusion. Since then, a bunch of \\"scanimation\\" and \\"animotion\\" books have been released, and these books have the page with parallel lines on each page, and it automatically slides and creates the illusion of motion when the book is opened.  I can see this book being desirable by a collector of movable books. If you are buying books for children, you will probably be much happier with the \\"scanimation\\" and \\"animotion\\" books.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I'm your basic entry level hifi enthusiast.  I've spent too much time putting thousands of watts in my trunk and simultaneously inducing hearing damage and car alarms.  Strangely I've been an avid enthusiast of a flat equalizer with more tonally balanced sound as long as I can remember.  Albeit a very loud tonally balanced sound.  Suffice it to say this engineering genius has received its fair share of review homage.  I'd like to sum up my experiences relatively briefly with a few pros and cons.  Read this review from the perspective of a self proclaimed metalhead PC nerd.  Pros:  -With just about any headphone amp (portable, desktop, DAC, no DAC etc.) these are not terribly imposing to power.  (Not performing well with an iPod is NOT a detractor, just a fact.)  -Double digit Hz to Khz these suckers represent the full spectrum very well.  Don't expect a large amount of punch, they're just not that kind of can.  -You'll find yourself understanding the placement of an omnidirectional microphone in a Shadows Fall album as the skins and cymbals crash around all corners of your brain.  The detail for this level headphone is stunning.  -Paramount to this peculiar suspension style design is long use comfort.  PARAMOUNT.  I've got a large skull.  I can wear these for an entire day with the stock pads and never once feel an ounce of fatigue.  Cons:  -My only con is reflected purely from personal preference:  the bass impact is less than overwhelming.  While this is a credit to the balance of the design I tend to love crashing double bass pedals.  The bass is definitely present.  It's just balanced as it probably should be.  This can be partially remedied through the use of an equalizer but these cans are just not meant to punch you.  What else can I say?  I'm a fan.  Don't get me wrong either, bass is well represented right as it should be but if you want additional details and are used to a subwoofer you're going to find those details in the upper Hz spectrum.  And you'll hear things you've never heard before.  I can recommend these on a beautifully balanced sound and comfort fit for a king.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this when it started. I was unfamiliar with the books, and the show really looked like a bit of a low-rent Lord of the Rings for television. When I watched the first episode, I was mesmerized by the production values but utterly bewildered by the huge ammount of characters and back story. I wasn't sure I would continue watching.  That would've been a mistake. I watched the pilot twice more before the next episode, soaking in every detail. I wikipedia'd the first chapters of the book and the character pages. I was into it. This show is an all out roller coaster. The characters are uniformly fantastic, the production exquisite, the writing and directing all beyond what you see in most theatrical films. The plot takes astonishing twists and turns, entirely unpredictable.   It's great. Amazing. If you get this set, it will be impossible to space out the episodes. You would end up watching them all as one giant 10-hour movie.   And in that regard it would be the best movie in many years
B004I8WD7S|4.0|While this case is pretty solid and is worth the price, there are some things that I didn't know that I think all should know before purchasing.  Cons:  -iPhone screen cover is cheap.  I guess it just doesn't stick to the screen properly, but it has a warped appearance.  It's not something that's terribly noticable, but compared to the screen covers I received when I first purchased my iPhone, it's lower quality.  -The edges of the case aren't as smooth as other cases I've had.  It's not sharp, but doesn't fit as comfortably in hand as other cases I've had do.  Pros:  -Seems like a pretty solid case.  -Fits snug.  -Low price.  Like I said, it's worth it, but those are some things I would have liked to have known before I purchased it.  I'm still satisfied because you get what you pay for.  It's inexpensive, so you get a semi-cheap case, but it's nice.  HOPE THIS HELPED!

B004L49K2A|5.0|By now it's clear no one should be surprised that Duran Duran will likely wind up the Rolling Stones of their generation,only in the sense they'll outlive a lot of their contemporaries. There the comparison ends. Even through important lineup changes this band has managed to survive it's original teeny bopper type new romantic image and become living embodiments of that style of music culture being more than a mere trend. And here they are together again-Simon,Nick and John & Roger Taylor. With some guitar accompaniment from Dom Brown. Considering the success of  the Justin Timberlake produced [[ASIN:B000VI70WM Red Carpet Massacre (Snys)]] there wasn't going to be much doubt as to the success of it's follow up. It just greatly depended on these guys talents to make it work.<br /><br />  And they did just that! A sure fire winner here with a record containing nothing but strong,mostly upbeat material that,in an interesting way sounds a bit like a [[ASIN:B00005BJ9W Rio]] Part II. While the band has adapted little bits of contemporary music to stay afloat they still have their distinctive,funk groove and electronically laden melodies still completely intact. And also they're still offering up a their trademark variety as well. The opening title song,\\"Runaway Runaway\\" and \\"Return To Now\\" are very much in the synth new wave dance/rock vein,however on the similar \\"Blame The Machines\\" there's a little sly social commentary regarding people's tendency to discount their own failures with technology. Paranoia of modern society is also covered on \\"Being Followed\\" and the tabloid send up of \\"Other People's Lives\\".<br /><br />  On another groove \\"Safe (In The Heat Of The Moment\\",\\"Girl Panic\\",\\"A Diamond In The Mind\\" and the usual animal metaphore in \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\" all feature in some way that deeply bassy,rhythm dance funky sound of their early 80's era,the latter song on the more midtempo end of things. So are Duran Duran ever going to be one of a variety of dinasaur bands? No way if this album says anything. It seems many of today's biggest stars for Lady Gaga to Chris Brown seem to be fascinated with 80's new wave era sounds. So inadverantly Duran Duran are right in their element. But they have survived before. And as long as they feel they can continue putting out music of the same high caliber as showcased on this album,I see no reason whatever why they shouldn't continue doing exactly that.No way if this album says anything.

And as long as they feel they can continue putting out music of the same high caliber as showcased on this album,I see no reason whatever why they shouldn't continue doing exactly that.
B004X80QNG|5.0|App started up right away. Synced with google right away. No problems like other were complaining about. I Like the set up/lay out. Works great!
B001VM0LAK|5.0|I have rented two movies from Amazon so far and both times have been a good experiance. I can recommend Amazon movie rentals.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I hate it when people 1 star review things before their releases but this is meant as a warning! Ultraviolet digital copy is virtually unusable junk that is now being packaged with a lot of movies. The Ultraviolet Digital Copy doesn't work with iTunes it only works with a streaming service through Flixster and when I say \\"works\\", I mean it can only be used with a streaming service through Flixster that doesn't even work. Great movie, but unfortunate combo with ultraviolet digital copy, was really hoping to get a genuine digital copy with this release. :'(
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love this Christmas CD, but then I love all of Buble' CD's. It's upbeat. Received CD very timely. Very satisfied.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Received item in a very timely manner.  It works really well at protecting my new kindle fire and have received several comments on it from fellow co-workders.  They all like it as well and are planning on ordering one either for them selfs or for Christmas presents.
B004X80QNG|5.0|The app works really well with my android/google calendar. All the info transferred and even the agenda widget reflects the changes. It would be nice if this asp had its own widget. I'm frothing to it bc of the ease of use and multiple options.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I loved PI on my pocket pc so I was thrilled to see it here.  Sadly this version force closes on startup.  droid2. uninstaled
014241722X|2.0|Great story, but a little strange, the story was too simple, just because it's written for YA does not make us stupid.  The author has a great back ground with adult books but has no idea how to lay the foundation for younger readers. Take his name off the cover and this would not sell ahlf what it has.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|It's Harry Potter, for goodness sake!  And one of the best of the lot.  Each of the books is better than the one before it.  That isn't quite true of the movies, but mostly so.  This one is great.  They did have to make some compromises from the book to fit into the movie, but I guess most of us wouldn't watch a 5 hour movie...
B005H0IW6W|1.0|I was so excited about the release of this album having thoroughly enjoyed his previous release Let It Snow. Talk about disappointing!  The songs are so slow and boring...totally lacking the MB pizzazz I've come to expect and love. When Santa Baby started playing I had to shake myself awake. Even the always upbeat and fun Holly Jolly Christmas as lack luster. This album is boring boring boring! Not romantic due to the slowness of the songs but just one big bore. Michael can do so much better...I'll just stick to listening the few tracks on Let It Snow and try my best to forget ever hearing this album.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Classics and more! Incredible voice and well done, perfect for getting into the holiday spirit! Love it! Highly recommend! Music the whole family can and will enjoy. From grandma to the teenagers, perfect Christmas music to be enjoyed by the whole family.
1451627289|5.0|A thought-provoking story that I didn't want to end.  I was completely absorbed.  Was anxiously awaiting the release of this book, and Mr. King did not disappoint.  Outstanding.
0062101897|5.0|Read all the books and seen all the movies. This book is fantastic! I am throughly enjoying it and I am giving it as a Christmas gift to dear friends' fifteen year old daughter. She's going to love it!
B000O98R7A|5.0|Excellent product.  The packaging was clean, the product arrived quickly, and I got to play this on vinyl for the first time in 20-some years. This never gets old
0767812387|5.0|saw this movie on TV ten years ago and I never saw it again. Just by chance I found the movie and eagerly wanted it. I have watched it ten times already. So happy.
B00008FRNJ|5.0|Excellent product.  The packaging was clean, the product arrived quickly, and I got to play this on vinyl for the first time in 20-some years. This never gets old.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|I am a long time Queen fanatic and I had to buy this set. The remastered original selections are classics and the rarities instant classics. The accapella operatic track for Bohemian Rhapsody is awesome. I love the backing tracks and the live never before recorded versions are the best. Even the live BBC tracks make this a sure fire hit. If you are a Queen fan from the day or a new Queen fan this is a must have for your collection. The next two box sets are a must buy as well. I can't say enough about the Queen 40th anniversary box set #1 it made my year. Long live the memory of Freddy Mercury, long live Queen.
0062011847|5.0|Terry Pratchett has done it again.  Put out a book that had me engaged from the beginning to the end.  Snuff features Commander Vimes of the City Watch (of Ankh-Morpork) being strongly encouraged (forced) to go on vacation with his wife the duchess and his now 6 yeard old son, Sammy.  As usual, nothing is as simple as a vacation - there's something going on at his family estate.   Goblins are being persecuted and a form of Shanghai slavery is going on.  It unfolds gradually, with Vimes catching a whiff (really, the goblins have a strong odor) of what's going on and not stopping until he gets to the middle of things.  Not only is he getting involved in a rather long lasting and complicated intrigue, but his son is getting involved with the family estates - via poop.  Yes.  He's beginning to learn about farming and animals (and science and biology) by studying poop - and what little boy isn't happy with that?  I enjoyed the usual mix of humor, dry wit, a bit of social snark and wonderful action scenes via Pratcett's writing.  He's is a genious with words.  I love the way he keeps two or three action scenes going on at once, going back and forth with micro cliffhangers between the differing characters.  Love this type of writing and Pratchett is a wiz at this.  There are appearances by Nobby, Captain Carrot and Angua, Lord Vetinari and his \\"butler\\" assistant and Willikins - Vimes valet who has wonderfully wicket assassin skills.  I love these novels = all the novels set in the Disc World.  If you're a Pratcett fan, you're going to enjoy this one.  Hoping to read lots more from Pratchett's world.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|This series is basically the story of how Starfleet and the Enterprise crew drove the creation of the Federation of Planets. The origins of many of the details of the Star Trek universe are explained. The characters develope throughout the series. The packaging is excellent and the video looks awesome on an upconverted DVD player connected to a 1080p TV. It's been fun watching the whole series in order. Higly recommend to all Star Trek fans.
0451527712|5.0|I am an 18 year old college student, and I was required to read Frankenstein and analyze it. Being an avid reader, I never had much interest in Frankenstein and sighed at the thought of having to read it.<br /><br />At first, the book seemed like a difficult read, and I wanted to put it down immediatley. But, being required to read it, I went along with it.<br /><br />Into the first couple chapters, I became more and more interested. When the Creature was finally ressurected was when I had my epiphany.<br /><br />This book is packed full of messages regarding Knowledge, Passion, Regret, Sorrow, Selfishness, and Prejudice.<br /><br />Those who dislike this book must not have the mental capability to \\"read between the lines\\" and find the hidden messages that Shelley places.<br /><br />Overall, one can learn much about the value of life, and what it means to truly be happy.
1451627289|5.0|I couldn't wait for the shipment of this book. Thank you for sending it promptly and in perfect condition. I appreciate receiving my order in the condition it was described.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|Winters' management recently announced that he is completely addiction free after slowly reducing his doses of Methadone and this album proves that he's still got it. His signature growly voice is back in form as are his chops. Many blues artists have recently completed collaboration projects and now Winter has joined their ranks with the help of some of the greatest blues players alive. Especially impressive is the slide guitar work of Warren Haynes channelling Duane Allman and Johnny's younger brother Edgar's sweet but sassy sax work.
6305657947|5.0|The dvd was received in a timely fashion and in the new condition in which it was described. Great movie, thank you!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|The app is nearly perfect. I gave it a four out of five because I wish the developers provided a little more to their game. For instance, I wish the difficulty setting was numeric instead of a slide bar so you could monitor your progress as a player. It would also be cool if the app tracked the player's wins and losses by a numerical difficulty system. This way you could see how many times he or she wins on level one or two, etc. Otherwise, the app is perfect. I highly recommend it.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This has turned out to be cooler than I expected.  My daughter loves the imaginative play involved with using the zip bin as a house, with different rooms.  But I love how it zips up into a huge storage container for barbies.  Super toy.
B000002N2Z|5.0|i love this album, from the year, or should i say time period it came out in, the cover, the rawness, chinos vocals, to the songwriting abilities(which would latter come out to be even better. is this their best album or even my favorite album by the deftones? no not even close. that tells u how good deftones are as a band. i love song number two and ten on this cd......................... oh and i love on the product description how it says \\" call it whatever u want, emocore, new metal, or sneaker metal\\". laugh out loud.. sneaker metal. thats hilarious
B0064XWI98|5.0|I was put on to BTR from  a few of my friends kids and one of my little cousins. I enjoy their show and their music.
B00000JCOV|5.0|give this cd another 5 or ten years and it will be regarded as a modern day classic. every song is clever and crafted nicely for heavy metal. the samples and dj with two procusinist adds an extra wall of heavy metal assault to the already two crunchy axemen. this is one of my favorite cds by one of my favorite bands from my time period.  slipknot is what black sabbath was to the 70's, metallica to the 80's, and pantera to the 90's.  if u like slipknot check out meshuggah and pantera. long live heavy metal people
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I got this backpack for my Nikon D90 and my lenses. I didn't want to pay the $99 for a Nikon backpack that looked as though it was essentially the same thing, only with the name \\"Nikon\\" on it.     This backpack has worked exceedingly well and I loved the price!   It is a decent backpack that is not going to fall apart on you. If you want save a little money on the backpack for your SLR, get this backpack.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|The Captain America is great!  It came out the same time as many \\"super hero\\" DVDs but this is one of the very best available at this time.
0307593312|3.0|If you love Murakami and you'd enjoy a long read of his usual fun style of quirky twisting novels, then you should read this book. It's a extended version of his typical work. It's long; long enough to be the one book you take on a lengthy trip, read over the holidays, ...   Sadly, it's not his best work AND his editor should be shown the door... there are a silly number of errors throughout this book. I'm curious if the same errors are in the Japanese version and got translated. Or, were they made while changing the language and making cultural adjustments for readability?  As long as the book is, I thought it was shortened to it's detriment in areas involving a character named Ushikawa. This character should have been allowed to more carefully discover or infer information he's looking for. We're told he can \\"smell\\" the correct course in the investigation, but this actually seems a little contrived. Worse yet, it feels like a literary shortcut.  In a nutshell, I wouldn't recommend this as your first Murakami book. A fan of Murakami should read it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game....easy to play and understand...if you like solitaire on your computer you will love this game!!!
B002U6DVQM|5.0|I first saw this film in an art house in New Orleans back in the 1960s.  I sold my standard dvd version and purchased the blu-ray version because I wanted to experience the best audio and video possible for this film.  The black and white video is great and so is the film and Rota's music is hauntingly beautiful.
B005QI4TP8|3.0|It's never a good sign when you have to wait for track 3 to hear a good song. I loved \\"Lungs\\" despite the fact that there were a few clunkers on it. I didn't read the press that had Florence stating that she was planning to make a record that expanded on the big production approach of songs like \\"Dog Days...\\". Sadly many of the tracks on Ceremonials have more in common with \\"Lungs\\" worst dud \\"You've Got The Love\\" than \\"Hurricane Drunk\\" or \\"Rabbit Heart\\".<br /> Flo should have taken a few more months to write some solid tunes, because all the gospel choirs and fist-pumping anthem-style choruses can't make up for such a lack of great songs. There are a few really good ones here \\"What The Water Gave Me\\" and \\"Seven Devils\\" stand out for me. I hate to say it, but dowloading the 3 or 4 solid tracks here would be better than experiencing \\"Ceremonials\\" as an album.<br /><br />I listened to this last week after not hearing it for months, and am revising my rating. I still think it's pales in comparison to Lungs, and that \\"Shake It Out\\" is just dreadful, but some of it has grown on me, and sophomore albums have a reputation for disappointment. It helps that I have the (2CD) UK deluxe version, if I were basing the rating on the regular (or even the US deluxe edition) it might still be a 2 star record for me. Hopefully she will remember to employ some subtlety next time out and not sing everything as if she were auditioning on American Idol.
0756686970|5.0|My 8 yo son loves this book!  It has a lot of information about the Star Wars characters.  The only drawback is that I now know too much information about those Star Wars characters!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Solid app well worth it. It has alot of information with a good setup to display it without being overwhelming!
0307888681|3.0|I can see the draw of this book. It's the kind of book that's ripe for discussion, and a lot of it. It's almost like a history book on zombies, it's a thinking reader's chocolate cake. It's told in a style like the movie JFK by Oliver Stone, only without the Jim Garrison narrative. I suppose the interviewer is the cohesive viewpoint readers are meant to follow, but the interesting parts are told by the interviewees.<br /><br />In summary, I'm in the middle on this read. I didn't love it and didn't hate it, I just couldn't connect long enough with the raging passion I'd hoped for. A [[ASIN:0380973839 The Martian Chronicles]] or [[ASIN:055338256X I, Robot]] (the books, definitely not the movies) approach versus the one used would have worked more for me. I doubt if it had been a book of short stories with a connected theme that stylistically it would have attracted as many readers or critics hailing it as a revitalization of the zombie. The one thing it did do--that all good books do--is it made me stop and think: what if?
B003Y5H53S|1.0|This movie has got to be one of the dumbest movies on our planet!  My 20 year old daughter who was with me at the time said it seemed like a project they were using to practice making animals and then decided to make some money on it and smooshed it together into a movie.  During the whole movie we kept looking at eachother saying \\"are they serious?!\\"  There were a couple of laughs, but mostly a waste of our time movie!
042524489X|5.0|Nalini is one of my best author. So far she never let me down. I'm not going to give any spoiles, just read it.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|First off, I love the album. It's different. Fresh. The dubstep fills the void that Brian left. If you open your minds and ears you'll hear how amazing the album is. Every song is different. In my opinion I can't find any fault. You have the bass, drums, electronic, screaming, piano, and bagpipes. It's KoRn.
B0063IH60K|5.0|With the exception of the constant ad pop ups during the game I believe this to be one of the most enjoyable free apps that I have run across so far. The graphics are great and there seem to be no gliches with the game itself.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|When I first saw this movie on DVD, I loved it.  I was most happy to find it available for purchase.  I enjoyed Renee Zellweger's performance and Ewan McGregor's as well.  The story was heart warming and heart breaking all in one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app works great for me on the Fire. nice, clean interface. and I enjoy having local (or any)  weather at my fingertips.
034544678X|5.0|I love Patricia McConnell's training  because she has a firm knowledge base, loves dogs, and has a wonderful sense of humor. I often rent her training DVDs and have learned a lot that is valuable in working with our dog, Regal, as well as the Belgian Malinois puppy we are presently fostering for the military. This book and the DVD by the same name explain how we as primates are similar to our dogs, how we are different, and how these things impact on the relationships we form together. There are many things we do instinctively that are not considered polite in the canine world. For example, dogs generally do not enjoy being patted on the head. Who knew? Most people will pat a dog on the head at first meeting. I know I did; I didn't know that it was rude. Regal will tolerate it, but he often ducks away. I thought he had been abused by his previous owner before landing in the shelter where we found him. That is probably not the case. He just doesn't enjoy being patted on the head, period, so I try not to do it. (I still forget sometimes. I'm only human, after all.) This book enabled me to see myself and other humans in a sympathetic but humorous light. We are pretty funny when you think about it. Yet this book also deals with the tragic scenarios that occur with people and their dogs such as aggression and dogs damaged by puppy mills. McConnell is frank in explaining that sometimes these things can be dealt with and have a positive outcome, but not always. in order to clarify each of the problems she covers in the book, this author gives specific examples from her experience as a dog owner and as a behaviorist working with clients. She provides a great deal of information but in terms easily understood by lay people--dog owners who simply want to have a more positive, meaningful relationship with their dog(s). I enjoyed reading this book and certainly learned a lot while doing it. I recommend it to novice dog owners, people considering dog ownership, and those with significant dog experience.
6305176299|5.0|I've been replacing my old VHS library with my favorite DVDs.I was excited when \\"Speed\\" arrived. The bad news was that the disk was damaged; my player informed me of \\"disk error.\\" I emailed Amazon and sent the movie back. Not only did they promptly replace my purchase,but they refunded my return postage.I recommend Amazon for your online shopping this season. Oh, and I recommend the movie \\"Speed\\", too. Great cast, 'edge of your seat' action! EE
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this app is soo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo coo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ool
B0052GACNM|5.0|As great as Duets I if not better. I bought one for me and one for a dear friend and we both love this guy.  Great price through Amazon.
B005Z271Y6|4.0|Be forewarned.   I picked up the Blu-ray as a surprise for the family, thinking if it was good I might buy a copy as a Christmas gift, etc. Adele is an extremely talented singer, a gifted writer, and seems very down to earth. But why the language? Given the venue, her elegant dress and material, what's with \\"****ING ROYAL ALBERT HALL,\\" and everything else that follows in her between song chats with the audience? And it's a shame, because she's a fine storyteller. Anyway, the Blu-Ray is labelled as \\"EXPLICT CONTENT\\" and rightly so.  Audio is very good; visuals are good but too many cuts for my taste, but overall very enjoyable, except for the language.
043902353X|5.0|The book was in great condition and I recieved it ahead of time.  I could not wait to find out what had happened in the book and was excited to receive it.  Thanks for the quick service.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is really good. I recommend this movie being in everyone's blu ray collection. There is a ton of action and lots of great acting such as The Joker's role.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I find it sad that people can get so entrenched in trying to be hip that they are unable to think for themselves and enjoy an \\"unapproved\\" artist. The Lucky 13 tattoos, the gas station attendant shirts, the poster of Johnny Cash giving the finger... all point to Tom Waits or Nick Cave CD's or some drearily smug nod to Jazz. Doris Day hasn't been on the approved list since way before these phonies were born. It really doesn't matter to me; she is the real deal. I'm so happy that enough people are unpretentious enough to acknowledge this startling singers legacy to make this record a bona fide hit. I find her version of Move Over Darling one of the sexiest recordings ever made but now, on My Heart, you can hear that incredible voice and spine tingling vibrato on a crisp clear recording. There was a reason Day was one of the biggest stars in history; the singer who could act, then the actress who could sing. It seems pointless to go track by track because Day ignites every one. Perhaps the only other singer that came close to Day's ability to grab ones heart in this way was Karen Carpenter.   It's not the great innovative musicians who dismiss artists like Doris Day or Burt Bacharach, they can recognize a towering talent, it's the insecure scenesters.
0913866156|3.0|... with such a tiny \\"Instruction\\" booklet smaller than the cards themselves and the print was so small you need a major bright light and a magnifying glass to read it... the cards are beautiful but the \\"Instruction\\" booklet and and actual instructions\\"??? Uh... Cryptic. Vague. Confusing. Contradictory. Obscure. Ambiguous. Uncertain. Unclear. Perplexing. Incoherent. I guess I'll have to purchase a real BOOK if I want to learn aboout the deck and meanings of the cards... my bad... wish they would have shown the booklet though I could have made a more informed choice.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I got this CD for my mother for an early stocking stuffer. She loved it. I appreciate receiving it fast and in perfect condition.
0061928356|5.0|I LOVE this book. It is a beautiful story. I plan to buy a copy for each of my daughters for Christmas.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|This was much better than The Lincoln Lawyer.  Mr. Connelly does not write a bad book, in my opinion.  I have never been disappointed in the quality of story or development of characters.  I can't wait to read the latest Harry Bosch, The Drop.  Thank you for many many hours of wonderful reading Mr. Connelly.
B000I9X7R6|4.0|Much better than your typical survival movie.  Watched on instant view and couldn't take a break.  Highly recommend.  Well written and the acting was superb.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I think the current version (3.5.0) is buggy. It shows Dec 7th weather details on Dec8th. This continues even after shutdown and restart of my Kindle Fire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down! From the very first sentence, I could tell I was going to love the story. I had not yet heard of it, hadn't even read any reviews (or even the jacket cover).<br />The previous owner of my Kindle had the good grace to leave it for me to find, and the title caught my eye one night.<br />Suzanne Collins paints such a clear picture of her characters and the world they live in.<br />I fell in love with Katniss and found myself rooting for her throughout the book.<br />I ended up buying the book for my fifteen year old niece for Christmas, and I am positive she is going to love it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app has an amazing number of choices ranging from paper to drawing medium to additions :) My kids and I love playing with this app!
B004X80QNG|3.0|I had this app on IOS and raved about it but things have moved on. Google calendar is pretty good, this doesn't improve on it much and Astrid does task lists better and free. I'm left wondering how this can be worth a tenner. Finally, the lack of a homescreen widget is inexcusable at this price.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Been awhile since this was released now, but if I hadn't already bought this one, I'd do it immediately, especially in Blu-Ray.  Great action, some good acting, editing is fine, and indispensable addition to the Marvel collection. Good sequel too!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I must say this is my favorite weather app, I have been using accuweather on my Ipod for a long while. It has a good interface, with lots of useful features. I really like being able to add other Geographic locations throughout the world and check out what is happening with their weather. I noticed the map feature works better on the kindle fire than it does on my Ipod. Highly recommended.
B000TCEU4Q|3.0|Seems good for the low price but the levers have a cheap plasticy feel to them.  Doesn't match well with the Saitek pro Cessna pedals I have.  Needs a little resistance in the levers and a more robust feel.  Seems to work alright though, just could be better.
1423140591|5.0|My son is a great fan of this series of books. He will read them in just a few days. I have also enjoyed these books myself.
B004JK61K0|2.0|Since the Kindle Fire e-mail client doesn't support MS Exchange, I decided to try k-9 mail.  Unfortunately, it will not connect to our exchange server, even though I have carefully checked the settings.  There doesn't appear to be any useful help or diagnostic information available for troubleshooting this problem, so I have uninstalled it.  Amazon needs to add MS Exchange as an option to the built in e-mail client.  After all, the usual Android default e-mail client does support Exchange.
B0052VI2WA|5.0|Review of SACD multi channel. I have owned the original LP since its release and know the music well. The remastering is excellent - the music retains its punch, which is sometimes lost when the dynamics are expanded. The tapes must have been in very good condition because the overall sound quality is high. The instruments and their individual sounds are better than I have ever heard them. The 5 channel mix immerses the listener in an 'on-stage' experience and works really well. Top marks.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|It seems like they may have fixed the Google reader integration on the fire. works perfectly! almost as good as flipboard.
B004CR5TD0|2.0|The music is very left-field, rather uncomfortable, not really musical. The vocals are also not very well executed, his voice sounds rather grating. Sometimes this type of music can sound creative and exciting, but this album doesn't work. I am not sure what inspires the good reviews.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|A friend turned me onto this app.  At first I wasn't sure if I liked it,  but as it learned my texting habits I fell in love with it.  A texting must have.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I have enjoyed playing chess on my kindle, however the adds are annoying. They are inappropriate and they pop up on the bottom of the screen making it easy to accidently click on when trying to log out. I would rate it at a five if it didn't have the adds.
1589944607|5.0|This is one of the most fun games I have ever played.  It successfully marries the paranoia of the television series with a gaming experience.  The game is complicated with a heavy rule book and a constant need to reference that rule book for questions.  However, once your group learns the game it goes by faster.  Players do not need to know Battle Star's story to have fun playing.  Something to be cautious about.  Your group:  I recommend this for a regular group.  The first time you play the game requires about 30-45 minutes of instruction and lessons before you can jump in.  If you constantly have a new player, this can become repetitive and boring.  Also, having a player who does not care, or is just plain bad can really hurt the fun of the game.  For an example, my friend brings his fiance all the time.  She somehow is constantly the cylon and we are always able to figure this out in the first or second turn.  This does not necessarily ruin the fun of the game, but often makes us wish for a play through where the cylons are more crafty.  The few times our more \\"cunning\\" players have been the cylons have been extremely tense and powerful matches.    Great game, buy it!
0938045768|4.0|Real great book, despite all the prison stuff, the progressions are great..  I started very slowly, and after 2 month, (30*3 on the 4 basices) i can tell that it's getting a bit tougher..  good pics, clear explanation..  i'll stick to it and see what it gives in one year..

B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to see on smaller screens. Responsive play. Just basic solitaire which is fine with me. Nice having the options  provided. It could use smart destination (suck card to where it goes when moving).
B001DJ7PQ4|1.0|Purchased this after a lot of going back and forth on if I should. First set of DVDs I have purchased for the Doctor Who series since its return to t.v. Sad to say that upon opening the box set 4 of the 6 disk were scratched so deep I could not get them to work no matter how much I cleaned or used a scratch remover.   As for series four itself, I enjoyed it. Run of bad luck for me, maybe.
B004LUS390|1.0|I just got a brand new kindle fire and all the app dose is close and you have to force quit it and you can do nothing with the app
0307346617|3.0|WWZ is a innovative concept and a good read, but it's hardly the masterpiece people make it out to be......for one, its too fragmented, and some really interesting ideas aren't developed well enough. Brooks definitely sketches out some good narratives, like a US soldiers point of view, and survival stories ranging from refugees in Canadian winter to a group of Chinese deserters in a nuclear submarine.  But for every compelling \\"interview\\", there's a silly or ineffective one, like a Hollywood filmmaker who makes anti-zombie propaganda films or a mercenary hired to protect celebrities who are web-casting their barracaded mansion. And some of his details are just plain weak, like a form of depression that kills people in their sleep or \\"quislings\\", humans that lose their minds and start acting like zombies.  Overall a good book but not great. Don't believe the hype.
0345522478|5.0|I downloaded the audio version of this book from audible.  The story was fantastic and Luke Daniels does a great job narrarating. I can't wait to get Hexed so that I can continue the story.    I hope Kevin Hearne has a lot more coming our way!

B006C45MRE|5.0|This movie was awesome. If you like the genres you'll like the movie.  If you hate Cowboy movies and Alien movies, you'll hate it. I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!  Anyone giving this a bad review should be shot, hanged and then incinerated by one of those wrist devices.  Very cool how he ended up with the thing on his wrist too...
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Across the Universe is my favorite movie of all time, i recommend it to everyone, beatles fans, musical lovers, and romance junkies alike!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Although I love the CD, I do have one complaint.  I wish it were 12 new songs.  I hope there are more previously unreleased music that will come out but I'm not sure that will happen.  Many of the songs, as well as the versions on the CD, can be heard on youtube but I'm still glad that I could have the CD.  I miss you Amy!  Love and Peace.

I just love everything about this book!  Started making the swishy scarf last night and can't wait to try the Floral Purse and the Hook Holder!  Also the Springtime Throw, The Chunky Seashell Scarf and the Summer Evening Shawl are looking mighty appealing too!!!
B005L3HJ8M|1.0|This CD is an unbelievable disappointment. Past Coldplay albums were full of songs that touched you emotionally. Mylo Xyloto is filled with uninspiring songs that just don't sound like they are put together very well. Put quite simply, this doesn't sound like the Coldplay fans have come to know and love.
0545157617|1.0|Stick Man is a huge disappointment.  Three disturbing themes are within this story. The first mistake is to portray a stick as a living thing.  It is bizarre to read serious adult reviews about being nurturing to a stick.  Second mistake demonstrates a parent figure giving up on life!?!!  Third mistake is having Santa find and return a missing person.  What is the author's purpose?  I mistakenly purchased the book thinking it would be a comical variation of the gingerbread man.  Instead I'm worrying about children in families with a suicide history and hoping Santa will return a lost loved one.
0307593312|4.0|...maybe, but not always in the way you expect. Murakami's novels are compulsively readable because of a kind of David Lynchian tension that underpins everything.  But does anything ever actually happen?<br /><br />It depends.<br /><br />The best way to experience Murakami's writing is to suspend your skepticism, ditch your expectations and drop into his world.  Like water, his words flow and meander, assuming the shape of whatever vessel contains them. Let them pour over you. Absorb them. Release yourself from the confines of the traditional narrative where every plot has turning points that appear at set places in the structure.<br /><br />Years ago I read Sputnik Sweetheart and am still not completely sure what it all meant. But I'm still thinking about it. How many other books can I honestly say that about??<br /><br />In straightforward, unadorned language, Murakami will tell you a story. Your presence is all that is required. In 1Q84, Aomame exits a taxi and enters an alternate universe. If you allow yourself to experience Murakami, you will do the same.<br /><br />PS:<br />(from the NY Times):<br />\\"For his article on novelist Haruki Murakami, Sam Anderson visited some key places from Murakami's life and work.\\"  Google \\"Murakami's Tokyo\\" in  the Times.  Anderson's article will take you to several locations in 1Q84 including:<br /><br />The Metropolitan Expressway 3 where Aomame exits the taxi in the opening scene of the novel<br /><br />The Prada store where Aomame buys some \\"killer clothes\\"<br /><br />Nakamuraya Caf&eacute;, where characters meet and coverse<br /><br />You can also visit Kinokuniya Books where Murakami purchased the supplies to begin writing his first book, Kanagawa Prefecture, where he lives part time and the baseball stadium where he got the idea for his first book.
B005CKPQHA|5.0|This has to be the most gangster show ever.

Sure that is annoying, but no harm don right? WRONG! This CD was packaged with another CD I ordered and both CD cases were crushed to plastic bits.  Surprisingly the CD stayed intact.

1451648537|4.0|Steve Jobs was truly a leader. The book traces his career and the fact he was not trying to win popularity contests. He had the ability to loook ahead and beyond. His arrogance may have caused his death because he did not seek early treatment.

B003UD7JEO|5.0|I am a big fan of La Femme Nikita and still think it was a great  and unique series that has had multiple spin off copycat series. This NIKITA series is along the same lines but different enough to make it interesting. I thing it is well acted with good scripts. Micheal tended to over act and go a little overboard on the facial expressions in early episodes but got better in later episodes. I had a technical problem with 3rd BlueRay disc that I still have not figured out. I would definitely recommend and will be buying subsequent episodes.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The music and the script flow into a magnificent movie that has stood the test of time, this movie and it's cast will certainly go down as one of the all time greats
B000063DFN|5.0|Because there's nothing else I can say about Iron Maiden.  They rock on every record they have ever put out.  True, they have a few songs scattered here and there that are duds, but they are far and few between.  90% of their records rock from begining to end.  They are and always have been very creative and interesting.  Any true fan of the band has all their records and know what I am talking about.  I will agree that once Bruce Dickinson took over from DiAnno they soared far and above anything they might have done with Paul.  However, even those two records were great for what they were.  I've never heard any of Blaze's b/c I have always heard they are completely awful.  So I don't have those. But every record released during Dickinson-era Maiden is great.  Thus, I give all of his Maiden records 5 stars.    [[ASIN:B000063DFN Powerslave]]

1451648537|5.0|After reading this book, I feel that Steve Jobs is the poster child for \\"Baby Boomers,\\" and may be historically the most notable person of that generation.  He seemed to incorporate the best and worst qualities of the post- Wold War II culture. This is a worderfully written book that must have been difficult to research.  Congratulations to the author.
0811879631|5.0|This book is down right gorgeous. My only wish is that I were able to take the color scripts and blow them up to mount on my wall as artwork. Any Pixar lover will thourghly enjoy this book.
1935597760|4.0|This is a very enjoyable read - one of sharp contrasts.  In fact I found myself dreading the chapters dealing with the orphanage. Thankfully the author used descriptive but not excessively graphic scenes to portray the horrors of those institutions. And she balanced it with delightful humor in the chapters about Jamie's adult life.  The characters are well drawn; the best of which is Rose McFadden.  I laughed out loud at some of her dialogs and learned a great new word...\\"And it's a terrible thing when a body is incapissitated in such a way.\\" That one line was worth the whole book!<br /><br />I regret that the author didn't use more Irish idioms and that from a purely practical point of view the story is rather unbelievable. But it has a sweet, feel-good ending which is irrestible.  In short, I laughed and cried - it's a good book!

B0058VW36U|1.0|On November 23rd, the developers at Cut the Rope released a new update with new levels, called \\"Tool Box.\\"  It has been on Google Market since that day.  Two weeks later, it is still not on the Appstore.  I emailed Amazon; here is their response:  --------------------  Hello,  I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused.  Updates for your apps will automatically be made available in \\"My Apps\\" once the developer submits the app, and it's approved by our Review Team.  Depending on when the developer submits the app for review this may result in the update being available after other marketplaces.  Our goal is for Amazon Appstore customers to have a great experience with every app they order. As a result, we test all apps and updates prior to making them available in our store to verify that each app works as outlined in the product description, does not impair the functionality of the mobile device, and does not put customer data at risk once installed.  You can let the developer know you'd like to see their updates made available in the Amazon Appstore by submitting feedback on their website.  --------------------  Two weeks to get an update?  I got this app as a free app, but I am giving Market my $1 to get the updates on time.

0060873027|3.0|I waited patiently for this book to be published.  I knew Michael Crichton passed away before finishing this book and that it was being finished by Richard Preston.  While a good effort has been made here it doesn't deliver a satisfying ending.  This one might have been best left unfinished.
B005V1WVPA|5.0|Chaos Lives in Everything: Good track. 4 and a half stars out of 5. Not 5 because it gets repetitive.  Kill Mercy Within: AMAZINGLY AWESOME!AHHH! 5 out of 5. Perfect.  My Wall: The Dubstep works especially well in this song. 4 3/4 out of 5 because the chorus isn't as catchy as some, although it is still an awesome track.  Narcissistic Cannibal: Very Good. Catchy. Fast. Heavy. :) 5 out of 5.  Illuminati: Quite good. Not great but good. The chorus sounds like a pre-chorus though 3 3/4 out of 5.  Burn the Obedient: Relatively amazing. Gets a little formulaic, but catchy as f*** and very heavy.   Sanctuary: Eh. Love it or Hate it? I don't care for it as much. 2 1/2 out of 5. Still has its strong points though. THE CHORUS! rest is very, very bland.  Let's Go: Pretty good, but repetitive. I find myself liking it more each time I hear it though so... 4 8/9 out of 5.  Get Up!: Fresh as F***. 6 out of 5! AHHHHHH! Beyond Perfect!  Way too Far: Amazing song my favorite! 7 out of 5. Farther than beyond perfect.  Bleeding out: 5 out of 5. Good close. CLIFFHANGER THOUGH!   Standard addition overview: Good. Best album since Issues in my opinion. Proof that Korn still has talent after nearly 2 decades. 4 1/2 out of 5.  BONUS TRACKS!!!  *Fuels the Comedy: OMFG! HEAVY AS SH**! HAPPY! WOW! 5 out of 5!   *Tension: Sick! Scat! Classic! Umm. The scat reminds me more of Louis Armstrongs Scat then Korn's. Catchy, Rap influenced. 4 1/2 out of 5!  Special Edition Overview: Good. Best album since Follow the Leader in my opinion! Korn is Amazing after nearly 2 decades. 4 3/4 out of 5!  (Bonus Tracks make the album so much better, no joke. They should have replaced Illuminati and Sanctuary in the standard edition.)

0316017922|5.0|The book, \\"Outliers: The Story of Success\\" by Malcolm Gladwell teaches readers the fundamentals of recognizing opportunities and taking advantage of them. The many examples provided in the book offers a blueprint in the shaping of one's own destiny. One of the most important tenets of the book was that autonomy, complexity and a connection between effort and reward is the portal through which people become successful.  You can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but if your work does not make you happy, you do not become fulfilled in life, which is the goal of every person on this planet. Without fulfillment, or the sense that what we do is satisfying and meaningful, we become aimless and unhappy because there is very little that will ultimately make you feel happy or fulfilled in life.  Other lessons of the book extol that success follows a predictable course. It is not those with the most money that succeed. It is not those that are the most famous that are successful. It is not those that are the brightest or the smartest in the world that are offered the most lucrative opportunities. Success, in a nutshell, is determined by those who are offered an opportunity and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize and take advantage of them.   This book has taught me that in order to become successful, you cannot wait for your ship to come in; you must swim out to it! Meet challenges head on, persevere and embrace the opportunities that come your way, regardless if they are big or small, significant or seemingly not worthwhile. Behind every action we take is the potential to make our lives, and the lives of those around us, a much better one. We are all born to be successful in our own way; knowing how to use the opportunities given to us is what will get us there.  Overall, I feel that this book offers a very good primer for people, especially those ready to embark on life's journey right out of high school or college, to immediately make a positiveimpact in their lives. This is a great book, and while a somewhat quick read, the lessons and stories shared within are invaluable to those looking to make a difference in their lives.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I rent this movie with no knowing what this movie is about, and if you see a 1 star anywhere, they're not talking about the movie, lol..so just ignore.   The only reason I decided to see this movie because of the casts and the producer, I mean, come on, Chris Columbus.. yes, those are the perks from the outside that made this movie attractive to me. Then I watched it, and I went \\"I HAVEN'T SEEN QUITE A GREAT FILM IN A WHILE\\" and this movie is just GREAT, and I mean it! A+++++  All the way from the casting and the story and the pictures, and soundtracks, the angles, all are just excellent.  I've been skeptical seeing new releases nowadays because generally all the movies out there are pretty much \\"weak\\" in terms of story and the way they tell it through motion picture, but not the case with this one. The Help is a movie worth watching, worth buying, worth renting, worth everything. Your time will not be wasted.   Go see this movie already!!!!!!! Go!!!  Brilliantly done ;)
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Works great. Gives a beginner like myself a good game. Easy download from Amazon. It has good graphics and again works just fine.

0439813786|5.0|I read this and my daughter, now 11, read it twice.  It is an intriguing tale.  The visual aspect of the story is amazing.  We really enjoyed it, and the movie is very very well done.  I think for children who are visual learners, this books might appeal to them.  Much of the book is illustrations.  Little children might also be excited to be able to read a very big hardback!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|this performance of adele was everything i expected...in addition, the artwork/photos are a throwback to a different era and are simply stunning...the music is amazing, and while her voice might seem a little strained at times, she is clearly enjoying herself...the stories are great...her laugh is infectious...and who doesn't love a confetti cannon filled ending?...the venue is visually beautiful and i enjoyed the cover songs...she sang mostly from 21 with a few songs from 19 (which i didn't enjoy as much as 21)...all in all totally worth the money...u get the concert dvd/cd, beautiful packaging...great for a gift to the one person on the planet who hasn't heard of her yet...cant wait to see what she does next
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My wife is huge Harry Potter fan. She read all the books as they were released and has seen all of the movies in theaters.  I pre-ordered this collection about 2 weeks before it was available and when it showed up at our doorstep, she was elated. Needeless to say, we've already watched all of them again.
B000002AS3|5.0|How come nobody seems to know that Aldous Snow from \\"Get Him To The Greek\\" (& \\"Sarah Marshall\\") is based on these swaggering, boozing, Brits? Sure he's a hybrid of all pompous 90s British rockers whose ambitions exceeded their audience's patience... but, uh, does that not primarily describe Oasis?  Radiohead took a much different trajectory, The Verve imploded right after their best album, Travis was a sweet little band of little cultural importance.<br /><br />As much as they weren't the second coming of the Beatles (because who ever could be?), Oasis was an incredibly good rock band. Don't undermine their legacy just because a) they're too popular or b) were bombastic or c)weren't art-house tacticians or d) produced albums of diminishing returns in their later years (but not that diminishing--don't judge those later albums just by the lukewarm singles they released.  If you have time, check out \\"(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady\\" from Dig Out Your Soul and report back to me).<br /><br />Play this album on a bar jukebox at around midnight with a good crowd in the 24-34 demographic who came of age with 90s rock and there will be literal cheers.  In fact, they'll raise their glasses to the sky.  They'll sing along.  This is Oasis at its most fresh and bawdy and take-no-prisoners.  I'm making my kids listen to it as part of their rock education, that's for surely.
B0058A119G|5.0|Great 2 CDs. Has old songs that I remember my parents playing on their records and it has some of her old favorites from previous albums.  I love Barbra and have not bought a CD that I was not happy with.

This a must buy!
0465043577|4.0|The one downside about this book (and I find other books like this) is that it ends up being long for the level of detail contained. An 15 page essay could probably capture the most salient points of the book quite easily. Regardless, I'm partial to the book because I find it a relatively rational and clearheaded approach to markets. Many theorists these days who have seen the efficient market theory fail pounce on the opportunity and hail their theory as the new lens through which markets should be studied -- Soros, Lo, Talib, and the list goes on. Mandelbrot is no different, but he identifies the shortcomings of his theory in a much more palatable fashion than I've seen from some other authors, easing you into his ideas. He plainly says that his theory is a new mathematical approach to securities prices, and not a mechanism by which to make money (at least not yet). His application of fractals from nature to securities prices does make intuitive sense. His work in other fields shed light on what you may find in the book: \\"Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line\\" -- neither do security prices follow smooth curves. He leaves the math out of this book, but certainly embarks on a fresh approach without sounding like he's found the Holy Grail.
0761158820|5.0|Super cute monsters that are fun and easy to make. The descriptions about each monsters are quite funny too. I'm 24 and bought this book for myself to make monsters when I'm bored at work and sit them on people's desks. They love them just as much as me. It would be ideal present for any kid aged 12 too.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is a GREAT !!! movie,but I  knew that before I bought it .. I LOVE pre order... I recived my movie same day it came out in stores. The UV digital copy is kind of useless from my stand point, just another account to worry about. We don't use phones as computers or tv's so I really have no need for it, Even my son in college said he would rather wait to watch it on Thankgiving break then on his laptop or phone.

B000059HAI|5.0|First, I want to comment on a few of the recent documentaries which were screened on pay TV, as part of the 70th annivesary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Most of these documentaires were woeful. They gave a poor impression of what actually happened, and the re-creation footage was washed-out and aenemic. They criticized Hollywood in general for their innacuracies, without being specific about the particular movies. Obviously they thought they could get away with it, given the generally woeful historicity of Hollywood. But if they were casting aspersion on TORA TORA TORA, they picked the wrong movie.  Another really irritating thing about these specials was the way in which they tried to create the impression that it was their recent research (the documentaries') that unearthed the facts  concerning the Japanese declaration of war arriving too late. Give me a break - these particular facts have been known for DECADES!  Anyway, to the movie. Of course, the directors were lucky - the real story of the Pearl Harbour attack itself had all the elements of a good drama plot - the crafty, stealthy enemy, the superpower caught napping, the late transmission of the war declaration, etc. But they built the tension and drama up extremely well, with the continual switching between Hawaii and the diplomat's offices in the States.  The Japanese - both the diplomats and the attack personel (pilots, naval officers, etc) - were believable and human; they were not portrayed as the evil machine-like enemy, but as sympathetic people (the Japanese war attrocities notwithstanding)  The attack scenes were extremely well-done; realistic, yet not overdone (as they tend to be today)  The pay-TV channels would have been better off replaying TORA TORA TORA, instead of putting on their absurd rubbish.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like the 30 Day Shred, but there is no comparison from this video to her newer release Ripped In 30. Ripped has 4 workouts instead of the 3 in Shred. Ripped comes with a meal plan. Shred doesn't. Ripped is designed very similarly - 20 minute workouts using the 3,2,1 system, but Ripped is more fluid, easier on the knees and I burn more calories per workout.

B002U0KHMY|4.0|My talent is I know what's good. This is entertaining you will like it. Characters work well together. Women will like Matt Bomer, Neil. Everyone will like Willie Garson, Mozzie. The second season is better than the first.
B005HIBWFW|5.0|This a realy emotionally flud work by the great Ken Russell, based on the life of one of the greatest composer, it stars the great Glenda Jackson along with Richard Chamberlin in the best film  performance he ever gave. Not for anyone looking for a warm cudly film.  It's a strong film by a master film maker!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|great movie loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this is the one to see its all a action movie should be and more this is recamended for all you movi buffs
B004SIP8SY|5.0|This movie is awesome!! Quentin Tarantino did an excellent job directing this movie. It's a spaghetti western/kung fu movie. I haven't seen Volume 2 since it came out in theaters, and I've always wanted it on blu-ray. But, everywhere I went it was always like thirty dollars! A friend suggested that I try Amazon.com. So I checked it out, and I was able to buy it for an insane low price. Now that I've owned it for a while I decided to pop it in the blu-ray player. I was stunned!! The picture was AMAZING!! The Sound was awesome, and the movie seemed to be better than when I seen it at the theaters! Although, I wish there was more special features. one deleted scene, and footage of the premier party, Are just not good enough. I was hoping for tons of bonus features! Oh well...it's still a pretty awesome movie and that's all that matters.
B00622HJ4K|5.0|This unusually serious episode is a marvel of character revelation.  In this intense moment of personal crisis that touches everyone we've come to love, their deepest emotions are ripped to the surface and exposed.  An absolutely crucial development in the overall story arc, the trust between Castle and Beckett that has been growing so painfully slowly literally bursts forth under the life-and-death pressure in \\"Cops and Robbers\\".  Complex and surprising, uncomfortable and intimate, touching and hopeful, this is - and will always be - one of the most certain \\"must owns\\" for me!
B004X80QNG|1.0|it seems to have what you need until I realized that it does now sync with ANYTHING. seems like a poor decision on their part considering everyone needs the ability to sync with something to keep all of their events strait in one account.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|What can we say. So glad that we got a copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1  on Blu-ray. Loved the extra features. Can't wait to get Part 2.
030726999X|3.0|Steig Larsson's last book brings his misanthropic tale to its entirely predictable conclusion. The villains - all men - pay their respective and appropriate dues, while the heroes - all women, with the exception of Larsson himself, as Blomqvist - get their just rewards, of which the greatest prize of all is undoubtedly a night in the sack with the author. Women get their revenge by finding their strength, which consists in outdoing men in every department, whether it be physically, mentally, in business, socially or sexually. Fleeting references to amazon legends of the past further reinforce the concept. Aside from the big three, Salanger, Berger and Figuerola, all irresistably attracted to one man, namely the marvelously enlightened super-journalist himself, there are others, doctors, lawyers, police, and more, who kick ass in their own ways, and plenty of other low-life men to get their asses kicked. There is no conception here of real female strength, which is really none of those things at all, and is what a woman would have written about, though of course a woman would never have written such a book. In his latest incarnation now Blomqvist truly becomes James Bond, as he takes on the Swedish equivalent of the CIA. The detail is marvelous, the research impeccable, the connection with real events is seamless. The same praise should go to the author's apparent knowledge of hacking, or at least his high computer literacy. And he can spin a fine yarn, no doubt about it. I've been a little more disappointed, though, with each progression of this series.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|We heard this woman in a Pizza Grille and I found this cd and bought it for my friend's birthday.  He absolutely loves it!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Based on the actual movie itself, I thought it was the best of the Harry Potter series!!  Such a wonderful ending to such a wonderful set.  I will miss it now that it's over.<br />One star for that lousy ultra-violet disc.  Had I read the reviews stating the issues with it before buying the last movie, I probably would have waited for the region-free digital copy, like other are saying.  But, alas, I didn't.  So, I'm stuck with a useless disc.

0810989956|4.0|The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that some of the jokes in it are poop jokes.  My 7yo son loves them, but they annoy me.
1451627289|5.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  It amazes me how easy it is to read King's work.  The narrative flows so easily.  You start in and before you know it, you are on page 200.    This book was a nice mixture of fiction and reality.  King's characters are interesting and relatable. Intersting twists at the end kept interest.  My second favorite King book after \\"Dead Zone\\"

B003UESJF6|5.0|It is the greatest movie I've ever seen. It is funny has plenty of action and just a splash of romance.I loved it!
B0068TJLSY|4.0|... only not as good as The Goonies. The cast of kids were all really cute and talented actors. The visuals were amazing. The plot kept me entertained. The only thing that got on my nerves was that the father's accent would come and go. I don't know why they tried to force him to drop what must be a prominent Southern accent. It would have made no difference to the movie and been much less distracting.

B005CAAURG|4.0|There is some good stuff on this album : We Will Rock you and We Are The Champions are all-time rock classics.<br />I think Spread Your Wings is a fantastic inspirational song - unforgettable. There is the punk rock Get Down Make Love, the haunting All Dead, All Dead , the angst-filled It's Late and the bluesy Melancholy Blues , which are also good.<br />But the album is not as good as Queen's first five masterpieces (which are among my favourite albums of all time: Queen , Queen II, Sheer Hear Attack,A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races .Its still worth having in your collection and it's still a hallmark of the roaring 70's , which is always a pleasure to listen to (Its also far better than 80's Queen) but it also marks a departure from Queen's classic rock-opera roots for which I most love the band. Of course musical fashions where changing by 1977 but for me Queen 1973-1976 are where it is at for the best rock music you can ever get!
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Best album I have heard this year. Several songs remind me of the great Mark Kozelek. Exceptional and meticulously composed, this is a great all around record.
0060555661|3.0|I purchased this book based on several recommendations from traders I know and while the information is relevant the author clearly has a problem with his prose. It's difficult to read a very jerky work.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|I own every original recording they have done and figured I'd at least buy a down load of this from E-music for $4.99 out of respect.  Trevor Horn produced!  How bad can it be?  Every YES album somce 1980 has at least one nugget on it to make it worth while!  Not this one.  This band creativly was cooked by the time \\"Going For The One\\" was completed.    They are a super talented Retro band.  They can still play at a high level and I enjoy the live shows even with the new munchkin.   If Howe and Squire are primarily doing the writing then its very predicatable what the sound will be.  My advice is to employ and inject new blood into the process and take risks.  It worked when the bought in Trevor Rabin and Billy Sherwood.  I get they are trying to play to their fan base but quite frankly there is notihng to offer in this album.    Out of respect I bought this.  Out of respect I gave it two stars.
0740797719|5.0|This book is a must have.  I feel that this is a complex subject.  However, the book is so well written that it makes color, shading and the other related topics easy to understand.    Thank you Mr. Gurney.

B0041KKYGU|4.0|This may contain a *spoiler.  Bad Teacher was a fun movie.  It's an adult comedy that leans towards the dark side.  Cameron Diaz plays the Bad Teacher and is so bad she's downright vicious and inappropriate.  There's very little that's redeeming with her until about the last 15-20 mins of the film when a little bit of her heart starts to show through.  The ride is rough, but its worth it.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD, the shipping was fast and the case wasn't broken like with other carriers.  This album has very good songs like public enemy #1 and the best: Th1rt3en. I think is as good as the past one: End game.
B000056HUA|1.0|My 2005 Acura TL has a DVD-Audio player, so I made an investment in DVD-Audio discs.  The selection was very poor.  I bought about 12 different DVD-Audio discs in 2005, and it should be noted that I did NOT buy any of them from Amazon.  This DVD-Audio version of L.A. Woman is the worst sound I have ever heard.  It sounds like a remix of a mono recording (extremely flat).  And they are asking over a hundred dollars for this?  I would gladly sell mine for half of that, but I have a conscience.  Save your money, and buy the audio-CD version.

0618871713|5.0|This graphic memoir is emotionally powerful while remaining enjoyable. Bechdel tackles subjects such as homosexuality, fidelity and death using text and images that are seriously tender, painstakingly rendered and suggestive. Exploring her past as a graphic novel makes her story feel very personal. Drawing the reader in through colorless imagery, her text then elaborates on the sadness and struggle illustrated on the faces of her characters.   She recounts growing up in rural Pennsylvania, focusing her memories on her relationship with her father. Discovering her own sexuality as she matures, Bechdel reflects on her childhood now knowing her father was gay. She is honest and insightful, sharing private details that occasionally make the read wince with sympathy and discomfort.
0788859544|4.0|I received this item the same week I ordered it (well in 7 days), it was exactly as described. I havent watched the dvd yet since it is a gift I just wrapped it.

B00008977N|2.0|The negative comments from other reviewers about the poor video and audio quality on this DVD are 100% correct. I was shocked to find that the sound is out of sync with the picture over the entire course of the DVD (well, I presume so--I finally got so disappointed with it about 2/3 through that I turned it off to come on Amazon and replace my old VHS version!). Also, the picture is extremely grainy.  The remastering job is horrible and Peter's studio-recorded vocals lack the urgency and energy of the live vocals they have replaced.  I am a huge fan of Peter Gabriel's work and I can strongly recommend Secret World Live--but not in this butchered format. You would be much better off finding a copy of the original VHS version. That recording is absolutely enthralling, whereas this DVD version comes off as lackluster, amateur, and poor quality.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|For anyone curious as to who ultimately was paid the money that taxpayers paid to bail out AIG and others who were involved in the credit default swap element of the 2008 financial meltdown, this book provides many of the answers. This book in an entertaining way takes the reader through the lead up to the 2008 financial disaster. Particularly enlightening is the author's explanation of how the major financial institutions deluded themselves about the mortgage bonds which lead to crazy credit decisions on the part of lenders. Greed in the banks lead to creative financial approaches absent any semblance of financial prudence. The book, as well as any I have read, illuminates the short sighted approaches taken to drive big bonuses where the recipient creates huge risk and ultimately losses for their company but are still allowed to walk away with millions of dollars of personal gain.   Before reading this book I knew someone took our money just did not know who and how, now I know. Although those people who screamed about the bailout should take the time to read this book so they know at whom they should really be mad. It is a shame we cannot make some books required reading before you are allowed to vote in the next election this would be one to put high on that list.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have always been happy with everything I get at Amazon, movies, books an any otyer assorted merchandise.  Robin Kaufman  ,
1451627289|5.0|This book is especially poignant for people of a certain age. I was transported back in time and King brought to my mind things I had completely forgotten about. Rotary phones, party lines, the different taste of food. There was a pantheon of memories dredged up from the recesses and I smiled each time he reminded me of how it used to be. But that is only one part of the King magic. His excellent story telling, great plots, and vibrant characterizations of all the inhabitants of this great novel made me want more when I finished. There could only be one possible ending to the book, so don't even let that stop you from reading it. The ending is appropriate and I wasn't disappointed at all.<br />Don't listen to the naysayers. Get this book and read it. You won't be disappointed. King is back, and he is back full force. All we Constant Readers are glad to see him.
1451627289|5.0|I love Stephen King's early works, then he seemed to just get off track to me. Not any more.  Thank you Mr King.  I just loved this book and read all 800+ pages in 4 days. Not a true horror story, but an intriguing time travel novel. Who wouldn't love to go back and just change one little thing, maybe two? There are twists and turns, subtexts and plots, all fascinating to me who lived through this era. I was 10 years old when JFK was shot and remember the people in my neighborhood running down the streets sobbing and screaming in fear and sorrow. (No, I didn't live in Dallas) 1958... isn't that the same year Christine came rolling out of Detroit?
B0061JPYX2|4.0|I was afraid this posthumous addition to Amy Winehouse's catalogue, much like Michael Jackson's latest 'effort' \\"Michael\\", was going to be a shameless cash grab orchestrated by her label, Island Records. \\"Lioness\\" appears to be an honest homage via heartfelt compilation that, unfortunately, never saw the light of day...until now.<br /><br />\\"Lioness\\" mostly consists of covers of tried and true classics (\\"The Girl From Ipanema\\", \\"Will You Still Love Me Tommorow\\", \\"Our Day Will Come\\" etc) and a few rerecorded tracks (\\"Wake Up Alone\\", \\"Tears Dry\\" etc) with a few official unreleased tracks thrown in for good measure (\\"Halftime\\", \\"Between The Cheats\\", \\"Like Smoke\\"). If you frequent YouTube, there's a chance you have already heard many of these unreleased outtakes and if you haven't then you are in for a treat. Excluded from the album are about a dozen tracks Winehouse supposedly did not want released. I fear, however, that this might be a hollow promise from Island Records to bait us into buying yet another posthumous compilation in the future; here's hoping I'm wrong.<br /><br />On a lighter note, however, Amy Winehouse's vocals sound great and her duet with Tony Bennett, \\"Body And Soul\\", smolders. \\"Wake Up Alone\\" is another gratifying track featuring a stripped down performance from the band complimenting Amy's smoky voice which sounds just as good as I remember. \\"Between The Cheats\\" is another fantastic original retro-pop song and one of my favorite cuts from the album. \\"Like Smoke\\" is the only weak track due to it's attempted merging of two completely unlike genres. Listen and listen good, Island Records: rap and soul don't mix. I like them separate and I don't know about you, but Nas and Amy Winehouse makes for a nonsensical, unpleasant collaboration. That said, it's also painfully obvious that his verses were recorded and added after she died just to haphazardly tack this track onto the album at the last minute. Thankfully, the rest of the album is saved by competent compositions featuring jazzy syncopated rhythms and harmonized male background vocals reminiscent of 1960's Motown.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Lioness\\" is a fine addition to Winehouse's already breathtaking retro-soul repertoire. I'm not ashamed to admit I actually shed a few tears while listening to it for the second or third time when it finally hit me...she's really gone. Despite her struggle with drugs and alcohol, which eventually claimed Winehouse's life at the tender age of 27, she provided the public with some quality music which is more than I can say for many of her contemporaries. Reportedly, Winehouse had plans to release a jazz album featuring Salaam Remi and the Roots' drummer Questlove...ah, what could have been. Amy, we miss you.aturing jazzy syncopated rhythms and harmonized male background vocals reminiscent of 1960's Motown.

B00008R9KF|1.0|Did you ever see one of those films taking place in a foreign country that makes you \\"not\\" want to go there.  This is one of them.  As a gay man, I do not want to meet these people...ever!  In American terms, I put the characters of this movie into the greedy sleaze meets trailer trash category.  If this is what it takes to make a critically acclaimed movie, then I should win every award conceivable filming my cat in her litter box.  The end result is the same.

It's still the same mix you already know but the individual parts in the mix stand out clearly. So this CD sounds like it used to when you had an original LP on a good stereo system and you get an extra CD of songs recorded at the same time or alternative versions. If you already like the music on the original, you'll love it remastered.

B001QWBM62|4.0|This is the second Zoom H4 I have owned, and I believe this is definitely an upgrade to the previous model.  I would give this product 5 stars except for the User Interface design which requires using a tiny jog-wheel on one side of the device to navigate all menus and click on all options.  Besides that it is top notch, and does what it advertises -- great for taking down song ideas, field recordings, bootlegging live shows or doing sound design.  It is one of the most frequently used pieces of hardware that I own.

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|A lot of shows seem like they would be worth watching again, particularly when I have such a short memory for shows. But, they usually don't. Serenity is one that really improves with multiple views. We bought the DVD, and re-loved every episode. Don't spend extra on Blu-ray, as the original does not seem to have high enough resolution to make a difference. We bought the movie that we have Netflixed twice after seeing the TV series again.
B005599XJK|5.0|Visually stunning, very entertaining! Tilda Swinton in mesmerizing in this film that spans centuries. If you're a period movie buff (like me), you'll love this one! Plus the story line is awesome, based on the book by Virginia Woolf. Pretty much the opposite of Jane Austen!!!
B00650SSWG|2.0|Disease is in, poverty's out!  Yes, the United States is in worse shape than at any time since the Great Depression but you wouldn't know that viewing the film FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS even though it takes place in Manhattan, where you're either dirt poor or filthy rich, and if it's dirt poor you'd better stay out of the filthy rich's way.  But as the filmmakers don't want you to think they are out of touch with life, they toss in Alzheimer's disease, which affects one of the main character's fathers, who sadly is forgetting the beachfront property he owns.<br /><br />Sure, in FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS these friends have benefits alright, more than you can say for the millions of Americans out of work or having jobs paying so poorly that health insurance deductions eat up a third of their pay.  In fact, so good are those benefits for the people in this movie, they don't even have to see anyone out of work or in one of those crappy jobs.  No wonder the young couple in FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS has all the time in the world to think about getting laid.<br /><br />The one interesting aspect of FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, portrayed by Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.  Credit the actors for playing it in such a way that you can believe they might never have thought twice about one another if one had something better to do, or, should I say, someone better to do. Not that I was on the edge of my seat, wondering if they'd get together.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|I went to see this because the concept seemed so ridiculous, i thought why not it might be good for a laugh. I didn't assume that because Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were in it, it would some how be a spectacular movie. There was no other movie that I wanted to see at the time so I went. I liked it in so much as it delivered exactly what the title promised. Was it a revelation? No of course not the movie is named Cowboys and Aliens. Would I have waited in long lines and paid full price? No of course not the movie is named Cowboys and Aliens. I was entertained and amused enough to watch the whole movie and not walk out on it (which I have done many times in the past). I could have done without Olivia Wilde's character, but that could just be not liking her and not the character. I'll buy Cowboys and Aliens when its on sale, and watch it when i want to be grossed out by the disgusting aliens, be amused by the ridiculous premise of the movie and admire the way Mr. Craig seems to make any outfit look good.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I've learned one important lesson from Danny Boyle:  A great movie isn't determined by how well you can explain the plot to a friend.  '127 Hours' could be the greatest example of that.<br /><br />Boyle has created ANOTHER great film from a plot that sounds like a mediocre TV movie.  You've probably heard the story: a lone hiker gets his arm trapped and needs to cut it off to survive.  If you think that's all there is to it, you don't understand the scope of what occurred in that canyon.<br /><br />I could write a 10 page essay on the lessons to be learned from this movie. I could tell you how this is a metaphor for self-importance in our modern culture.  But, it's more effective if you learn this on your own.<br /><br />Just believe me when I tell you this: DON'T judge this movie by the plot description.

The author is a wonderful wordsmith and he has created a vast world with a history and various races, the problem for me was that there wasn't a single character that I remembered when i was finished. That stood out in my mind as being the \\"protagonist' I enjoyed the style of writing immensely, but I am a fast reader and never has it taken me so long to finish a book. Too much detail perhaps?
B004LKRR6U|4.0|Something about \\"Pink Label\\" Grace not having name or likeness of Sir Alfred like \\"Black Label\\" The Birds; I love \\"To Catch A Thief\\" and the doll!! Probably won't buy \\"Rear Window\\" Grace...How about \\"Vertigo\\" Kim, with the white coat and the black scarf! Ooooooh!
0385535139|4.0|Excellent story regarding both street and corporate lawyers. John Grisham is one of the best storytellers of fiction books. lAs a lawyer, his stories all have good and bad aspects of the present day law profession.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|Count me as one who was not familiar with the French complicity in this particular incident. Also a great fan of the young lady who mesmerizes the audience with her efforts to save her brother. The ending slipped into a foolish romance novel territory, but overall a good story.
B004YHRZLM|5.0|It arrived within two weeks and in great condition. This is a Christmas gift and it will go wtih her Disney collection. I know she will enjoy the combo set.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A bargain app! Does exactly as promised - quick and easy access to your PC right from your tablet! so simple to set up...highly recommend!!!
B005L12SB2|5.0|The music is 5 stars,but the box set is so lame.Why is that only in Japan they know how to spoil fans.Only in Japan they care about the fans and release quality products. If anyone ever have seen a Japanese mini LP they know what I mean.On exact replica of the LP in miniature format.  High quality ,beautiful release.Well this set is nothing like that.A low quality card board sleeve with a stupid white frame on every sleeve.That was not on the original album cover ,so I have no idea why they did this.The whole thing looks so cheap and low quality ,it is a shame. I know the Japanese product is very expensive,but the quality is superb and worth the pries. At least the albums are remastered,so that is good. Sony is the worst record label when it comes to re releasing classic rock.They should let other labels do it if they don't want to do it in quality.Shame on them.
B00004W52U|4.0|This album itself is 5 stars, the reason this review is 4 stars is because this remaster is doing a classic album a horrible favor.  This remaster sucks, please for the love of humanity buy an original album instead.  Operation Ivy is a great group.
1451627289|5.0|Having read all of Stephen King's books, my favorite and his best is \\"The Stand\\".  Up until now I would have said his second best is \\"Cujo\\".  Sorry puppy but \\"11/22/63\\" is now his second best.<br />I haven't sat engrossed for a couple of days reading a book since I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  King's latest is a page turner and a book I couldn't wait to get back to when I had to break from it.<br />This isn't horror or by any means scary, but is simply a good read, a roller coaster of emotion.  Thanks Mr. King for taking me from this time for at least a while
B005URRCUY|5.0|Well, yes.  This is a new Black Keys sound.  And it is MINT.    Firstly, I have been a BK fan since the Rubber Factory days, and I have really loved each album they put out.  It's hard not to be amazed by these guys.  Even though I could listen to RF on repeat, I feel the same for all of the albums - and this one is no different.  So when you have people dogging them because it's a different sound, then smile and say 'good'.  It IS different and a new direction, and it sounds incredible.  They took some of their popular songs from the previous works (Howlin' for you, etc.) and used that to make this album  As a long-time fan, I can honestly say that this album ranks right up there with their best (and may be the best).  So don't believe the people who say they are selling-out.  That's crazy.  They are evolving, and I love every second of it.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|This CD is a MUST have for lovers of the 60's.  It is smooth, brings back real music you can relate to and understand. It brings back happy 60's memories, when life and music were simple. Excellent CD. Thanks Amazon for carrying this CD!
B0000640VO|5.0|This must be one of the cutest, best made movies I have seen in the last few years. I cannot believe it took me so long to hear about it...
B0050PYNOY|1.0|i really wanted to like this movie, but it SUCKED. i got a couple laughs out of the whole move, and only pray i never see it again. im glad some others enjoyed it, but if you're of the fan of the actors because of there previous work DONT WATCH THIS.
1926778103|5.0|Has nice artwork very good for reference seeing several different variations of the weapons, characters, and other things. It really helps me visualize their creative process.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|i believe amy would have been ok with the release of this cd, under the circumstances. the producers and her family did a great job with the material. it's real amy.....there are a few (wonderful) new songs, some fantastic covers, and of course, amy's  own amazing songs, in different versions. it's a treasure for fans; it's all we have now, and it is a worthy album in remembrance of amy's colossal talent. the tabloids were one thing, amy's talent, quite another. she really was a genius, and with genius comes difficulty. i only wish she had been able to stay with us for a lot longer.   this is not the 3rd album, but it is great nonetheless. it features amy's incomparable singing. this calls to mind the unique and tragic stylings of billie holiday, amy's closest equivalent in female top of the line jazz style interpreters. each of these ladies is stellar, in a class by themselves. each wrote some very classic songs, and their songs will always be remembered. amy's family can at least take comfort in the fact that amy's songs will always will be played and loved. and her voice will always be remembered as one of the best ever.  i think there is more material, and i only hope it is released, as well as some more concert videos. the full length concert video, \\"i told you i was trouble\\", although an official release, is very painful to watch. amy was in quite a bit of difficulty at this time, and it showed. the earlier videos, the bbc concert, the early videos on jools holland (uk shows), the mtv (usa) concert made prior to 2007....anything **before** 2007 is great to watch. there is a video of a young and fresh amy doing an instore concert at virgin records in london that is well worth seeking out- it's outstanding.   ......oh, how i wish i had been there. she did make appearances in the usa, before she became too involved in her struggles with sobriety. sad to say, she was going to be appearing in my town, but the show was cancelled. sometimes it's all about luck, and being in the right place at the right time. i did see a number of great artists in this way: most were relatively unknown, opening acts for someone else. sadly, i never got to see amy live. that is why this newly released material on \\"lioness\\" is so valuable.  miss you always, amy. rest in peace now.
0793518326|4.0|The work that went into this is impressive, but it is not every note from every album.  The harmonies are notes picked from chords and don't include the subtle nuances that were unique to the singers.  There are minor mistakes, typos, that will keep you on your toes and the notes about capos, alternate tunings and why the band recorded a few songs in cumbersome keys could be a little more explicit.  That being said, it's a wonderful , all-in-one reference book.  It would challenge all but the expert musician to improve their Beatles knowledge.  The only other warning is this:  the print is fine.  You old codgers out there with reading glasses will need plenty of light to follow the notation.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is the only pdf reader that allows you to fill forms in this price range and it works great!
B005M47VCO|4.0|This book is really quite fun, particularly all the details for each monster that make it unique (and hilarious)!  About the only downside that keeps me from marking it as 5 stars is that the paper itself, which thicker than most book paper, isn't exactly what I would call sturdy, so when you assemble the monsters they're still rather delicate.  Some glue sticks also don't work well as they don't have enough stickiness, and some of the heavier glues make the paper soggy, but once you do find the right glue, they're absolutely adorable (believe me, these are not scary).  :-)
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|A beautiful and surprising fairytale that'll move you from a place you'll never expect.  Reminiscent of early black and white film, with colors that are so stunning they'll leave you breathless.  It's an expedition, an adventure, a journey through the psyche; places we've all been, but maybe haven't had the strength to talk about.  Healing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this version a lot. I can make pictures of hot actors the background. it is fantastic. other then that, it's just really good.
0156027321|5.0|So I read this book for my high school English class. Somehow that age old saying \\"Don't Judge A Book By it's Cover\\" never really applied to me. I would always choose books by how the cover looks! So i was at my local B&R over the weekend looking for a book and I found this one. The cover interested me because of A: There is A Boat with an Indian Kid and A Tiger and B: It says \\"Life of Pi\\" but the book has almost nothing to do with pi!    So I started reading this book and I was captivated by the beginning of the book, with how one man could love God so much that he would partake in three different religions. I also found it fascinating how their poor family could own a zoo.  I slowly started to loose interest when he felt that there was no tiger on the boat. I felt that the cover of the book and the story contradicted itself but I soon learned otherwise. The book became a little slow until it was just him and Richard Parker. The point at where he shows Richard Parker where his territory ends until the end, I could not put the book down.  Amazing book! Loved it and can't wait for the movie!
B006J38144|2.0|WTF.....what else can I say...  This episode had very little action and nothing turned out the way you would have wanted/hoped. Yes, they left it open for another season, but there was no closure to this season really. It was very open ended and felt more like just another episode rather than a season finale.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app it works,cards are large, and it is fun. i love it! loads well the ads get annoying but great love it
B0000029AP|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  All the songs on this CD are just fantastic and pure classic rock and roll.  I'm a huge Aerosmith fan and I have four other CD albums along with this one.  And 'Toys in the Attic' tops them all and lead Aerosmith into its popularity in 1975.  The songs are all original and many are instant classics we hear all the time on the radio and at Aerosmith's live concerts.  Even today, 36 (almost 37) years later, people are still singing the chorus to 'Walk This Way' and 'Sweet Emotion'.  To begin the song list, their title song \\"Toys in the Attic\\" is one of the most adreneline-pumping riffs I've ever heard.  The fast paced music gets you excited and wanting to hear more.  It starts the album off great.  The next song \\"Uncle Salty\\" is a smooth jazzy song that shows Aerosmith's roots in blues-rock.  The effects of the guitar and stunning chorus provide a surround sound experience of a girl's unfortunate tale.  The third song \\"Adam's Apple\\" is Aerosmith's version of Adam and Eve.  This song is very fun and has a distinct riff and drum line.  The fourth and probably most popular Aerosmith song next to \\"Dream On\\" is \\"Walk This Way.\\"  Originally based off of the movie 'Young Frankenstein', this song proves its worth with the popular opening drum section, the all-known riff, and chorus.  It's a very fun song that gets you grooving.  The fifth song is the only one not created by Aerosmith at the time, but proves to be a great hit in their anthology.  It's \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\", a creative song that mixes Stephen Tyler's crude humor and blues.  The sixth song \\"Sweet Emotion\\" is by far one of my favorites of Aerosmith.  Tom Hamilton's bass intro and Joe Perry's talkbox create a psychadelic effect that leaves you wanted them to continue the song for ten minutes more.  And Stephen introduces probably the first rap to ever appear in a rock song.  The seventh song is \\"No More No More\\" and is a bit strange to hear at first but the tone grows on youonce they hit the chorus.  The eighth song is \\"Round and Round\\" and is my least favorite on the CD.  Although it is not a terrible song, Aerosmith's attempt at heavy metal doesn't seem to click.  The final song is \\"You See Me Cryin'\\", an emotional ender to the track that leaves you begging it wasn't only 35 minutes long.  So in general, this song is a must-own for any Aerosmith or rock fan and is a great starter to get to know Aerosmith's music.  They're many hits and popular riffs are all on one compact CD.
B005HPY8LU|2.0|Being that I had not heard a recording by this artist, I went along with reviews and bought it.  However, as I like good country music and old R&B this is not my listening pleasure, as frankly I  thought she was a country artist, but this she is not, so I cannot figure what she is.  I hated it.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Had this for about one year, enjoyed the good sound quality and microphone worked great, unfornately Headset fell apart on me.  First part that broke was where the microphone swiveled, fixed it with superglue, later the swivel broke on the earpiece. The plastic used for this headset was very poor quality, very flimsy.
B005KDWUFA|2.0|I have all Il Divo CDs, this by far is the worst.  The songs seem to drag on.  They should have better song selections.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Easy to use.  Performs as advertised:  Put your slides, movies, photos, and everything else that fills your iPad 2 screen on an even bigger screen  Apple Digital AV Adapter also supports HD video out for iPad, iPhone 4 and iPod touch (4th generation)  Apple Digital AV Adapter mirrors exactly what you see on iPad 2
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to agree with the other posts, Jillian is awesome! I'm 21 years old and wanted to get rid of my pooch belly and flabby arms. My boyfriend also wanted to lose some weight so we've been doing it together for about a week. The first few days were killer but it became a little easier, so I think we're about ready for Level 2!  It's so nice that each of the exercises is varied because once you think your arms are going to fall off, you go into cardio and once you're so out of breath, you get to lay down for abs.  I have very little time in my schedule that consists of class, work and student senate, so this 20 minute work out has been more manageable than leaving my house, going to the gym, coming back and wasting an hour or so a day and not getting results. My legs and arms have been tired (in a good way) since day one and I can feel myself getting stronger already.
0316056863|5.0|I have admired Tina Fey's comedy since her SNL days.  This book provides more of an insight towards her genius comedic mind.  The best stuff from the book comes when she puts her \\"feminist\\" (a.k.a. the right way! duh) mind to comment on women's insecurities.  I truly like/lover her more after finishing this book.   P.S. Had me laughing out loud from beginning to end.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|install and setup with ease, syncs well, will give full review after more real world use. So far I can read, edit and add events. All shared calendars are shoeing and syncing as well.
B006FS22Y8|2.0|Let me start by saying that I adore Amy Winehouse! She has been my favorite female vocalist for years. When I purchased Lioness: Hidden Treasures last evening, I was psyched. The $4.99 price was unbelievable.I downloaded the music without sampling, first.(I never practice this.) When I listened to the tracks, I was hugely disappointed. Five of the 12 tracks have been previously released in some other incarnations.( Tears Dry, Valerie, Wake Up Alone, Best Friends,Right? and Body and Soul.) With the exception of Body and Soul, which was available on Tony Bennett's Duets II,the other four tracks are inferior to their earlier- released versions. The sixties covers are at best, uninteresting. Leon Russell's A Song for You is an incomprehensible mess. Unless you just have to have everything Amy, save your money. Better still, spend the five bucks sampling earlier releases. These earlier recordings better demonstrate the magnificent artistry of Amy Winehouse.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This book delivers just what it promises, but gives you so much more to think about along the way. It made we want to know so much more about Epicurus and Epicureans. If you love history, philosophy, religion or theology, do not miss this book.
B0001HAISG|2.0|I am not easily overtaken by advanced effects, especially when they don't always work. That early scene when Peter floats from the ceiling having flown rapidly backwards to rest on it, still has the young actor moving so stiffly downwards you needn't see the wires to know they ate there. His body language tells you he is hanging by support wires. I also don't think a magical fairy such as Tinkerbelle would look so downtrodden with unruly involved hair, and still finds time to ham up to the camera with facial expression close ups. I also don't think a clever boy such as Peter would tolerate a homeless boy appearance for someone who is graced with eternal youth. Can you imagine living eternally garbed in nothing but leaves & vines, and walking forever on bare feet? Even looking like he hasn't showered or bathed in years. As fine as this movie looks, it has left the main magical characters appearing no better than your average homeless mortal. And Peter has no pointy ears, or that I could see under that massive bush. Not so magical but for the grace of special effects. Both Peter & Tink need to glide casually under the nearest waterfall in Neverland. Or does that mean they never wash, comb, or clean much.<br />AND I don't care if anyone on planet earth agrees, this movie sucks.
B0037XPP7U|5.0|This is of course a great movie. The acting superb and well match with the sequel. Delived in the typical high quality Amazon speed and packing.  But, don't miss Elizabeth the Virgin Queen, also very very good.
B000050HTO|4.0|Arrived quickly, in the shrink-wrap. The case however, was cracked. Not terribly so, but it's unfortunate since I bought this as a gift for someone. I'm still going to give it as a gift, but prefer my presents to be given in mint condition...
B004UHPU5E|1.0|As the CD title states: Jaksyk, Fripp and Collins, that's the \\"band\\". There's another GREAT collaboration called Levin Torn White [...] just to give an example, which is ABSOLUTELY GREAT and didn't need to steal any name. I suppose they used the \\"A King Crimson Project\\" because of bussines issues, because of the f****** market! which is not fair for real art lovers.    Said that I have to admit that I gave few listenings before understanding this A Scarcity of Miricles, is a very very well worked album, extremely full of details that you'd love if so for soundscapes, perhaps it's too much sang, I mean no any adventurous instrumental and I think this is one of the weakneses of this album, but on the other hand you have the alternative mixes which are AWESOME! specially Secrets and The Light of Day... wowwwww!!! then the impros which represent the inception of this collaboration (REMEMBER IS NOT KC).    So why only 1 star? Because this productions is deceiving, it's not honest, it's music may deserve 4 stars but as long as they stealed the name of King Crimson (no matter as a project) while it is not, no compassion should be shown to these business men.    I recomend it for Soundscapes lovers specially, once again, this is not King Crimson
B000001G16|5.0|I bought this record several years ago after coming across it accidentally in a record store. I was looking for Bon Jovi records I didn't have and this one stood out. I didn't know Richie had even done a solo record so I took a chance.  It's one of the best records I own - It's that good!!!  All Bon Jovi fans know Richie is a brilliant songwriter and guitarist but on this record, he also showcases his amazing voice. He really puts a lot of soul and emotion into his singing and it really is something special. When I saw Jovi perform in 2007, Richie sang 'I'll be there for you' and he sounded incredible.  Don't let the fact that Richie is a member of Bon Jovi put you off getting this record if you're not a fan. It's completely different to anything Jovi have put out. It is very much a blues album which showcases some of Richie's best guitar work. If you like Eric Clapton or Eric Johnson you must get this. It's just a shame Richie didn't make a true follow-up to this as 'Undiscovered Soul' was in another direction. Come on Rich, make just one last solo record, PLEASE!!!!!
0451205766|5.0|Well, not much I can say that has already been said.  I haven't seen the movie unfortunately, so I can't draw a comparison.  This book however is a grand epic, bolstered by rich writing and a well-done story.  Puzo's style might be a bit expository for my taste, but it still works in bringing the Corleone family and its exploits to life.  I stayed up until 3 AM to finish it, but it was worth it.  Highly recommended to any reader.

1416583432|1.0|One word-boring.  The author tries to throw out big words to try to impress people or something.  It was so dull that it was hard to finish.
B00000064E|5.0|this is an awesome cd, it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are<br /><br />tracks<br /><br />4. Way To Blue<br />6. Cello Song<br />7. The Thoughts Of Mary Jane<br />9. Fruit Tree<br />10. Saturday Sun<br /><br />if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Very Good and fast paced movie. I would definitely recommend this. The experience is different if the Prequel is enjoyed first, it was more touching than this.  Now coming to whats in the box. Superb packaging and the best part is all the Blu-rays are region free.  There are 5 discs in the box. 3 blu-rays, 1 DVD and 1 Digital copy. The top cover has a 3D Poster of the movie, as usual some goodies from Disney are in it.  There are lots of Extras in the Box that are worth watching.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I bought this for my mother for Christmas. It arrived quickly, shrink-wrapped and in one piece. I'm a happy camper!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this video on TV and decided to have it as a collector's piece.I am an artist and I appreciate all the work and design and choreography that goes with shows.This was indeed going to be his very best.The moves were his standard but mainly the choreography that was going to be done on this show,showed tremendous potential for entertainment.  It is very sad that he ended the way he did.No one should,especially with children in their lives.  May he rest in peace.  Nadia
B002MW50KO|5.0|My youngest son, age 20, has been asking if it was time to get Dylan's Christmas album out.  I havn't played it since this past July, so yeah, let the season begin. If you dig Dylan, get this album. It'll make a grinch grin.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I love Il Divo and I loved every song on this album.  In fact, my daughter was upset that the order was not for her.  She loved the album so much that she has confiscated my copy.
B0058WFO06|5.0|This album took my breath away! It is on such a different level, that it blows you away each and every single time you listen to it. I've been at a loss for words on so many occasions when listening to it. About the only thing I could even possibly add to what has already been said is that it is in my opinion that Steven has gone and created something above and beyond even his normal lofty levels of creativity. Maybe even that has kind of already been said...  This is how I feel... I absolutely believe this is the album of the year! I also believe this is the album of the millennium! And I think it is so good, that it can stand with the greatest albums that have ever been made!   How about that?
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is a a great series.  The dvd worked perfectly. I can't say enough good about, action, sex,blood, and ofcourse sand haha.
0062101897|5.0|This book was given yesterday by my bf for my birthday. It's am amazing asset for a Harry potter collector, I'm a Harry potter fan and this book is a great gift, so detailed so beautiful. Love it and recommend it.
B000001DVD|4.0|I'd give five stars and then some but two songs are missing. The other version of bringing on the heartbreak and Me and wine. Why are the two songs off?
B005KDWUFA|4.0|Love the album and love the group.  Bought this for a friend for Christmas since she too loves this group
B005LY3VRO|5.0|Another great collaboration of Britney Spears music and great DJs. Much better than volume 1 since her more current music is more dance music. I hope there comes a Britney Mash Up album!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This is my favorite concert dvd.  The quality of the music is great, not overly harsh like some hard rock bands.    Sounds awesome on my surround sound system.  I highly recommend it.
B004IYISSK|5.0|This is a book that is put together well and has good stories told in it. Amy Tan is one of my favorite authors.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Best solitaire I've played so far......Awesome.....It has great options and i haven't had any issues with the app freezing up or any other problems people claim to have had with this app.....You will enjoy it!!!
B004X80QNG|1.0|where are these good reviews coming from? I understand its free and that's awesome. but o hope people don't spend a ridiculous 9.99 on this app
B0063IH60K|4.0|For being a free app this solitaire is great, would be a perfect five if there were no ads. Download for sure.
1577311523|5.0|I relate to this book.  I've been a seeking spitit since my early youth and have engaged in many teachings, I find this simple and easy to practice, almost recreational.  I have the audio version of Practicing the Power of Now which I always revisit when I feel unconcious or disconnected.  Like I said, maybe not be for everyone, but I'm dismayed by some of the criticism in these Amazon comments that are personally directed toward Mr. Tolle.  I'm leery of people trying to make a quick buck in the name of sprituality, I don't think Tolle is one of them.  Although, everyone needs to make a living.  I think it's money well spent.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|I had to go back to watch Part 1 in order to remember what Part 2 had to do with anything!!!    I thought the other films were much better! Making this into 2 parts, seems to me it was strictly done to make more money, shame on you!!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 was an fitting end to the series. The action was excellent and the acting- from all involved, was impressive.   I think that they did a really good job with the special effects throughout and was able to capture the grand scale that the book conveyed. The epic battle between  Harry and \\"He Who Shall Not be Named\\" was a sight to be seen (though honestly that was the ONLY scene worthy of the 3D price in the theater lol). Good vs Evil!!   Also several characters, that you THINK you know, have their true motives uncovered.   Bittersweet that the series has ended, but, at the same time, happy to have been a part of the world of Harry Potter.
B000TBJSDU|1.0|Anyone who sells new vinyl for more than $30 a disc is a rip-off artist.  Scarcity is what makes anything worth a lot of money.  There are very, very few Beatles albums that are in any way scarce to begin with, and there are ZERO sealed, new Beatles albums that are worth $300, as I see one vendor doing here.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|I love the fact that it comes with ultraviolet digital copy. I enjoy watching it on my phone. Thanks a lot.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Generally, I believe in Thumper's adage from Bamboo. But this app insists upon a review. I give it 3 stars, Generously. It is far less accurate than the weather channel app. But it does offer radar. But half the time, the radar view completely locks up my kindle fire. If this was a paid app, I would give it 1 star, But since its free, ill give it a VERY RELUCTANT 3 stars.
B002ZG9940|5.0|This is a cinematic masterpiece. Clooney is cool as a cucumber and the actress, forget her name, is perfectly cast.  This is a much see if not to at least rent but to own.  I suggest you get the blu ray for the ambiance that is present throughout movie....and the visuals as also great...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good app, probably the best solitaire only app out there.  I just wish it had a couple more games like spider solitaire, freecell, etc.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|No problems running on Droid Charge.  Enjoyable game, only bugs are the ones you're saving.  Lots of levels to keep you busy.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|Dear Disney people who are in charge of making these crappy decisions,<br /><br />Don't pretend you can't hear all the people who are anxiously waiting on you to make the version of a widescreen as an un-cut version.  What's so hard about an extra 2 minutes on the disc?  I would have gladly traded the full-screen version for a wide-screen uncut.  And I think, judging from everyone else's feedback, that they would have preferred that also.  What exactly do you have against that song?  It was good enough for the original release (thank goodness!) and so it should remain uncut now.  I will not buy this DVD until it is, in fact, un-cut.  So, I will patiently be waiting for a DVD version to be released, and meanwhile continue to watch my precious VHS.<br /><br />VERY unhappy with you, Disney!<br /><br />:(
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Hanna if fresh and cool. Eric Bana was well cast and the actress is PERFECT..she is very convincing and cool.  There has to be another Hanna or it would be a tragedy....she was so cool..I see a at least a trilogy...
B0058VW36U|4.0|question: when will Amazon customers get the toolbox update?? It has been out for weeks in the Android market already...
B002ZHKZEM|4.0|Great disc set. It arrived in good time. the package was slightly handled, but I'm buying this to watch, not display under plastic. I am enjoying the series, perhaps more than the the first time.
B005IZLPME|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, but I'm a sucker for most comic book movies. I waited to get the 3D version since my TV supports it. They had the non-3D at my local store but I opted for Amazon's 3D version.<br />I have to say I've seen probably a dozen 3D movies on my TV and this one had the most lackluster effects so far. The 3D is there but not very impressive.<br />Bottom line: Its a decent comic book flick (gives you some setup for the Avengers). Don't expect the 3D effects to knock your socks off and don't use this movie to show off your 3D to friends.
B0058DBXN2|5.0|This book came to me as a suggestion from a client(Mike)in 2003<br /><br />After signing him up for my product, Mike wanted to talk with me about something.<br /><br />Mike told me that he saw a lot of potential in me and suggested that I read this book. I didn't read much of anything back then, except a newspaper on a daily basis, but I still bought a used copy on Amazon for a penny (plus shipping, of course).<br /><br />It stayed on my dresser for 2-3 weeks. On a Saturday, my wife went shopping, there were no sports to watch, so I picked up this book. MY LIFE CHANGED.<br /><br />After reading Chapters 1 and 2, I couldn't wait for Monday to come!<br /><br />My sales career went from hovering at quota to being a superstar. President club, management opportunities and much more money. But, a lot more happiness, too.<br /><br />I have suggested this book to 5 people at that job and each of them had the same experience. I still tell this story to many of the people I consult with (that I feel have the inside hidden desire to win) and have heard nothing but thank you from them.<br /><br />This is as close to a \\"sales\\" magic wand as I have ever seen.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great like it a lot for viewing weather clean interface easy to install and use on the kindle fire just set your location and go.Did not have any problems with.it.
B004SBX112|1.0|The update to the paid version on Angry Birds Seasons that came out this week does not work on xoom tablet. New levels crash- old levels still work.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. I have every one of the Resident Evil films and decided to pick this one up in 3D.<br />If you didn't like the other films than I really can't recommend this one. Nothing new here to change your mind about the series.<br /><br />If you've got a new 3D TV though, this film has some of the best 3D effects out there.<br />You can definitely use this movie to show off your 3D home theater.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Works great with my existing Alpine 9887 head unit with KCE-422i cable. Running \\"Full Speed\\" connection with iPod Touch 64GB 4th Generation and it charges while it's connected.<br /><br />Fully recommended!
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this for my grandchild ages 5 & 7 and they are haveing a great time with it, it keeps them busy when they aren't doing anything. It's a great way to get them away from the TV.
B0018TNMC0|5.0|A great Eastwood film even better in the Blue Ray format. If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood, you will love this film. Even if you are not a fan, you should still watch this film, it is just that good.  I was proud to add this disc to my Eastwood collection.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|The movie was workable, in good shape and played as it should.<br /><br />The last was the best.  Although the whole thing could have been avoided<br />had they just used the time rewinder and gone back a few months and<br />zapped Voldemort.  Oh well, good story
1905236042|5.0|I am a Physical Therapist and used these cards for activities for my clients. It works on visual-motor skills, reading, language, gross and fine-motor coordination, neuromuscular activation and motor planning. When I had kids of my own, I couldn't wait until they were old enough to use these. Now that they are, my daughter chooses a few cards to demonstrate and describe to me so that I can do them too...these cards are FANTASTIC and SO VERSATILE...there are so many ways to use them...One of THE BEST PURCHASES I have ever made!!!!
1932735410|3.0|I haven't started my prep yet but all my teachers highly recommended this for the prep.  Received in a timely manner. No problems.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Not with the movie - the movie was great, but I bought this in the widescreen format and it still played letterbox on my Sharp HD TV widescreen. I figured it would play using the full screen but it didn't. It may be something in the setting on the TV or DVD player but it was only a minor distraction because I quickly got lost in the movie.  I bought the non Blu-ray format because my Blu-ray player has issues but that's nothing to do with this. My recommendation: buy the movie in whatever format works for your system and enjoy the end of the series. The digital download is a plus too...we were able to finish watching the X-files (the reunion movie) for free. Nice bonus.
1439102732|1.0|After reading this whole book I was so disappointed by the way it ended. It was just such a flop that left you with nothing to think about when it was over. I would not recommend.
0060254920|5.0|I love this book and always have! Its such a good one. Much better than the movie. The delivery was quick and it came in great condition.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I ordered a new DVD but Amazon sent me an used one.  The DVD case was re-wrapped with the plastic but it was different wrapping style than original one, and there was no white sticker on top of the case which every DVD has. The paper case had two big scratch marks and a big dent.   I've been a Amazon customer for a long long time but I don't think I can trust Amazon anymore.
1419702238|5.0|I bought very very chip price of this book. My son(7 years old) likes very much and read as soon as we got. He lend a book to his many friends and it means that many children likes this story although they already had other series of wimpy kid. Now, I am waiting my turn to read this book after other boys finish to read.I felt that it is awesome when I read only few pages.
0307887960|5.0|I purchased this book for my wife who in fact after two weeks has lost 12 pounds and inches.  No sweat she says. One of the best diets she has ever been on..
B005HSG3TC|2.0|The Microshell Folio looked a lot different to me when I ordered it. I thought it would give me more protection for my kindle fire. I also thought that the folio would be able to free stand so that I could read hands free, but it keeps falling down. Not happy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to install on the Kindle Fire.  Easy to setup.  It has radar loops and nice weathers maps. It also loads fast and responds fast. Highly recommend.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|It is apparent that the movie was great .......as always.  A great ending to the Harry Potter saga.  My ONLYcomplaint was the Ultraviolet copy of the movie. The entire process of trying to set up not one but two accounts to get your movie, well sucks!!!!  Once you get the accounts set up you realize that you can not view your movie on iTunes.  I found tons of blogs from people online who feel the same way. Nice attempt to take away from iTunes but I won't be buying any movie that says \\"Ultraviolet\\" digital copy. Huge waste of money!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this free solitaire app!! Play it several times a day,definitely worth the dl. Don't even mind the occasional ads
B003INBNXO|5.0|This movie is a must, to be seen by all martial artists.  The amount of detail they put into the form itself is unbelieveable.
B006J38144|5.0|These short ass seasons are killing us man, as far as a finale goes it lacks but it leaves all wanting more so it is a success. I am in for one more season, this one made me glad I didnt jump ship after the last one. Just remember it is the telling of a story, yes there will be action but all in all it is about the drama.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|The title Wicked Games for their latest title turned me off, even though I am one of Il Divo's fans. I believe that I have everything that Il Divo has ever made, including the big book telling of their individual lives--a GREAT book. I was wrong. Wicked Games is a level of maturity that I thought they had reached with their last album. These men have wonderful voices and they compliment each other to a stunning degree. Each song gives a melody and a type of expression that leaves me wanting to cancel everything and spend a few hours listening to this one CD.<br /> Others have tried to copy Il Divo, but they do not match up. Their handsome looks, the way they seem to genuinely care for and appreciate each other as well as always a superb orchestra. Each voice which is a treasure alone. Each member is so much appreciated as the four of the men come together and express these songs as though they were written just for them. \\"Wicked Games\\" is apparently related to the first song. This CD is not wicked is it nearly divine.
B000002KKK|5.0|I purchased the vinyl version of this work way back when it was first published, during my high school days. This work represents a controlled ZZTop nuclear chainreaction. It smolders with sexually-fueled blues influenced pop. This album was so hot, that back in the day I had to wear cheap sun-glasses just to listen. It oozed with cool. Seriously, Deguello represents a successful evolution of artists that didn't need to prove anything. ZZtop ran the spectrum on this one; it ranged from recognizable blues-pop to near Jazz-fuzed tracs.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Wow!!! I think that the only way to explain this is to say that I wasn't the BIGGEST fan of Demi before I heard this CD! After this came out I was kinda 'just' a Selena Gomez fan and I liked Demi, but when I heard Skyscraper, and after I heard about all she went through, I really started to respect her more and love her music! So, I LOVE this album and I like to think that Skyscraper is like she's singing all about what she went through in the past and it touched my heart. Demi, I'm proud and SO happy to see you OUT of the Disney's \\"(Sky)crapper\\", and like it says on your new tattoo \\"Stay Strong\\"! :D   The songs on this CD are great and I can't wait to hear more! Demi, your voice, to me, has REALLY shown through, and grown stronger, and is amazing!!! Keep up the great work and keep staying strong. You rock!
B0002DXEPI|4.0|I wasn't able to watch this disc as I'm in the wrong REGION. I didn't know there was such a thing before.  I can only watch this video if I live in Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East including Egypt. I purchased it from the United States and live in Wisconsin.  I remember watching this movie years ago and was looking forward to seeing it again as I had just seen it performed in a high school musical.  Funny!

B000000OU0|5.0|[...]<br />THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM IN MY OPINION THE EAGLES EVER MADE. THEY PUT THEIR HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS AND PUT THEIR PERSONAL<br />JUNK TO THE SIDE AND JUST MADE GREAT MUSIC. THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|awesome! must have if you're an app whore like me! have all games in one folder, multimedia apps in another. I very rarely use the app drawer anymore.
0811876373|5.0|Very cute book with good instructions. I was already making cake pops, but this gave me new ideas and techniques.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I am using this with the Pyramid 3A 12v regulated power supply sold here on Amazon for $23-28; (the one highly sought after for the expensive V-DAC.)  I had to make a 5v voltage regulator (LM7805 $2 at radio shack, along with .1 uF capacitor on output voltage).  Sounds much better with this power supply versus the small switching wart provided.  Using it in an audiophile setup:  diy passive attenuator, behringer a-500 reference amp, infinity rs-2001 speakers.  $3000 sound for around $400 total.
B00008WT5M|5.0|[...]<br />THIS IS ONE GREAT ALBUM. I LOVE IT. IT'S AC/DC AT THEIR BEST ON EVERY SONG ON THE C.D. YOU CAN FEEL THE ENEGRY THEY PUT INTO THIS<br />ON EVERY SONG AND PROVES THEY SHOULD BE IN THE ROCK N ROLL HALL OF FAME.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|The Tennessee quartet has really nailed it on their latest album. The album seems to have a more relaxed and maturer approach each track i can listen to over and over again. The songs have a southern alt-rock feel. It makes me wanna sit by a campfire with friends or lay in a hammock and enjoy an evening with someone. \\"Pyro\\" and \\"Birthday\\" along with \\"Back Down South\\" and \\"Beach Side\\" are among my favorites but it is hard when each track has a similar feel, not necessarily the same tempo or beat, Caleb's vocals are inevitable and the instruments they have employed really boost the quality of the tracks. I highly recommend if you love Kings of Leon, southern rock, alternative country or just looking for something new to crave.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Every since I saw her first audition on \\"Britians Got Talent\\" I knew there was something very special about Susan. She has the voice of an angel. She has a rare talent. her heart is in her music. And she is not boastful about it. I have all of her CD's and will continue to add to my collection Susan Boyle Cd's as they become available!
B000000OSE|5.0|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000OSE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img.<br />THIS ALBUM IS BY FAR THE BEST ALBUM GUNS N ROSES DONE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH ALL THE BULL AND PERSONAL BULL EACH MEMBER<br />OF THE BAND WAS GIVING OUT TO THE OTHER MEMBERS,THEY DID MANAGE TO PUT THAT A SIDE, AND MAKE A GREAT ALBUM, BUT IT WAS ALSO<br />THE BEGENNING OF THE END FOR THE BAND.THEY JUST COULD NOT WORK WITH EACH OTHER ANY LONGER
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Keep in mind that i have not heard their earlier works but i love this album. I knew about the Decemberists through my Rolling Stone magazines and until this past year i decided to buy this album. I was very content with my purchase, the country-folk like instruments and Colin Meloy's vocals are irresistible! This with the Kings of Leon's \\"Come Around Sundown\\" are my top albums to enjoy the outdoors, it's just the feelings that are evoked when listening to this music makes me want to go outside enjoy the scenery and relax. My top tracks i suggest to listen to if you're not sold would be: \\"Calamity Song\\", \\"Don't Carry it All\\", \\"Down by the Water\\", \\"January\\" and \\"June Hymn\\". That's basically half the album each boasting it's own unique and wonderful story told by these harmonious Portland poets.
B004X80QNG|2.0|It would be a good app if it had widgets.  I like to look at my weekly schedule without pressing on the icon.  Install a widget and 5 stars.
B005DZMP00|3.0|First, the packing is cheap with one brochure of pix. There are no sleeves for the discs, making it very easy to scratch them.   There are spots where the Grateful Dead's magic shines through on this collection from the 1972 tour This is particularly true on Disc I.  BUT..... despite the terrific finale of Disc 2 which features Fade Away.....Going Down the Road...and back to Fade Away, the opening old fare..... Dark Star and Love Light are boring and the band just does not seem to be able find the seque into their usual brilliant improvisations.  Maybe, it was an off night.   This sequel is nowhere as exciting, musical, or inspired as Volume One of \\"Europe 72\\"  Also, the famous graphic of the \\"Ice Cream Cone Kid\\" has been hyped-up for our times, and is stupid with no visual impact. It might be better to burn a copy from a friend's CD instead of buying.  Or, buy the \\"Hundred Year Hall\\" CD which was an almost an entire performance played in Germany on the '72 tour The sound is a bit distant, but the band is on their game on every track.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|[...]<br />I CANNOT SAY A BAD WORD ABOUT THIS MOVIE AT ALL. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE FIRST ONE THE SECOND ONE WAS JUST AS GOOD, AND SO IS THIS<br />ONE. GREAT ACTING,SPECIAL AFFECT'S, AND THE MOVIE PLOT, STAY'S IN LINE WITH THE FIRST TWO.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I used to use a Palm Pilot, and when I switched to Android, I really missed Palm's powerful PIM apps.  Google's calendar app is okay, but there is no to-do list application included with Android.  I found a few that had limited task management, but I really needed something that can do tasks with alarms, repeats, and a day view that shows both tasks and events.  Informant gives me this power and more. It feels like my Palm's old calendar/task application, DateBk6. The calendar can do categories, custom colors and repeats beyond the simple daily, weekly, or monthly that Google Calendar provides.  Tasks come with repeats, importance/priority, folders, task hierarchy, and many other things I haven't explored yet.  One of my favorite features of the Pocket Informant calendar is that while it adds features, it still syncs with the phone's built in calendar app.  This means that I still get to use my Calendar widget and Android's buit-in Calendar sync.  Not only is this application very powerful, but it is extremely customizable.  There are more than 5 separate ways to display a week view.  This power and customization does come at a cost, when I first opened the app I was daunted with the plethora of buttons and information on the screen.  The settings are extremely full, but very well organized.  There is definitely a learning curve, but after a day of using it I can navigate the app well.  I already have a long list of tasks that will make me more organized and less forgetful.  My main complaint is that Google Task sync is still buggy.  I've had a hard time deleting tasks and lists, but with a little fighting it works.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Not too difficult. You can choose to always have a winnable game, or go with a straight up random deal. You can use your own pictures for the background and card backs. I love it!
B001AXOFS4|5.0|I',m so glad I bought this album. I play it along with Heather Masse over and over. I love most music but these really touch my heart. I have it on my iPod  the stereo and the car.
B0000E2FLC|4.0|I've never watched the vhs of this live show and so I can't tell you how the vhs differs from the dvd. People are saying that the audio has been tinkered with. Some say there have been some audio edits here and there. Some people say that entire songs have been altered, and to that I say I doubt it. What this is IS, a GREAT live show performed in front of thousands of enthusiastic fans. I think that a mid 80's show might have been better, but for what it is this show is tremendous. I bought this dvd used for $6. I have now watched most of it twice. I rarely watch any dvd twice in a span of a week, but this dvd is a lot of fun. I put the dvd on and I walk on my treadmill. AC/DC helped me to walk 4 and 1/2 miles in 92 mins burning over 600 calories. Therefore, AC/DC has been good medicine for my body. This is a FINE dvd. Don't worry about the so called drawbacks of this dvd. It's a KEEPER!!!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I watched this with my son about 15 years ago.  I loved it then and I still love it.  Kermit is the perfect foil for Michael Cain's Scrooge.  It's a fun, fun movie.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I cannot ask for more. This woman is brilliant! like Tony Bennett said she is America's Picasso! She has a great voice. She is talented. She is very creative! So proud of her!
1594744769|5.0|I really liked this book much more than I expected.  The story really moves and the author has a true gift for making the immpossible seem plausable.  I expected a kind of vintage ghost story but this one is much richer than that and in the end has you still asking more questions while it still satisfies.  I for one want a sequel.
0062101897|5.0|Gets into the nitty-gritty of making the movies.  The careful detail to the different characters wands, Death-Eater Masks, text books, etc. was very interesting. Great photos. A book for those who want to know more about making the movie as opposed to cast member details.
B005V20JKI|1.0|When it was available for free, I tried to download, it went to my Droid and sat there.  Nothing happened?  Now I have tried to cancel, tried to continue downloading and the icon is just sitting at top of my phone and not doing anything!  Not a happy camper.
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|This is a GREAT movie whether you have read the book or not.  The acting is absolutely top notch.  Bryce Dallas Howard did a fantastic job.  You can't help but to absolutely loathe her character! I saw this movie in the theatre on opening day.  It was sold out! And everyone applauded at the end!  When is the last time you went to a movie and that happened?   And here's some information a lot of people may not know.  The author of the book, Kathryn Stockett, had a maid growing up.  So did the movie's director, Tate Taylor. His childhood maid has a cameo appearance in the movie.  Kathryn and Tate are long time friends. As are Octavia Spencer (plays Minny) and Tate.  Kathryn met Octavia years ago and when she started writing The Help she based the character of Minny on Octavia!  So she was the only choice to play her in the movie.  Love the blu-ray and the digital copy.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|This case is just OK, I've had better and I've had worse. I prefer the Incipio one over this actually. MUCH better quality and feels better in the hand. Unfortunately Incipio is not clear and slightly more bulky.  THE GOOD:  -Very clear, not \\"smokey\\" or cloudy  -once you get it on, it fits pretty well & very snug  -doesnt look too bad, shows off sides of phone  -if you have a screen protector on it, the lip covers the edge and doesnt make your screen protector peel off.  -havent dropped it yet but seems like it has pretty ok protection (not too thin)  THE BAD:  -kind of a sticky plastic cheap feel  -leaves lots of scuff marks and finger prints all over it. even on the inside if you get any sort of finger print it presses up against the phone causing an oily black mark.  -VERY hard to take on and off!  -cut out for the earphones is not centered.   -design on the back is kind of tacky (just an opinion though)  Overall, its ok. I will probably only keep it for a month or two before I get sick of it. I just hate the sticky plastic feel and the smudgy fingeprints on the back. And good luck trying to get this on and off the phone. I feel like I'm going to break the corners of my phone every time I try to take it off. And the only reason I have to take it off is to clean the scuff marks and lint that gets back there. Yuck.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|This film doesn't have the impact of the original, but it probably scores a little bit higher on the entertainment factor.  Butler looks even better than Camile Keaton from the original, although the much remembered castration scene from the original still packs more of a punch than the scene from the remake.  The films replay value is pretty good, but it doesn't really have that grindhouse type feel that I like.  The film should've had a dirtier type feel to it, and it would've been better with that 70s or 80s type feel that is present in the original and other films like FRIDAY THE 13th, MY BLOODY VALENTINE, MARDI GRAS MASSACRE, HUMONGOUS, NIGHT OF THE DEMON, THE BURNING and all those other 70s and 80s exploitation films.  It's got some problems and it could've been better, but it's still a cool movie and it's among the best of the horror remakes. This film, which has a more modern and polished film style, is designed to appeal more to mainstream audiences. At the same time, it has enough exploitation elements to appeal to fans of 70s and 80s exploitation. There's full nudity in the film, but the rape scenes aren't as impactful or as disturbing as the ones in the original; I'm not saying they have no impact. I'm just saying that I don't think they're comparable to the scenes in the original film. This is the same for the violence. Although at times very graphic, the violence doesn't quite pack the punch of the first film; but these scenes still have impact. If you want something really fast paced, you might be disappointed; The movie moves decently, but it isn't fast paced. The movie does concentrate on character development and story; it isn't all exploitation from beginning to end. If you want something that's overloaded with gore, you might also be disappointed; it's nasty and gory at times, but it isn't filled with blood from beginning to end.<br /><br />The DVD quality is very good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great for when you just want to sit and chill. Not too many adds. Doesn't freeze up my Kindle while playing. Overall its pretty much what I expected.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I love this Comic book genre film, just like several others of recent production. They do not need academy award winning Socialist messages. This one like all the super hero films keeps us actively excited, and awake, only the G.I. Joe Movie could not deliver the same feel good sensation; probably because G.I. Joe was a UN organization and not the American Hero we remember.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|This lightly padded cover holds my Fire quite nicely, although just a tiny bit snug.  One thing I don't care for is that it leaves the little circular impressions from the eggcrate like padding if my screen is in the least bit dirty.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie will make you think twice about how you treat people of different ethnicity.  To the people who thought this movie was not worth the five star rating......then you must be like the characters who had no respect for others!!!
B005C5A6C0|5.0|This is every bit as good as The Blackening and more classical in nature. Locusts gets better with each listen. In fact, the entire album is epic- reminds me of The Wall as for theme. Def get this.
0792839749|4.0|I love watching Dick Van Dyke in these types of films, he seems such a natural for his character!  This story was a favorite since childhood and another needing updating to DVD from our home-recorded VHS copy.  The story shows the heights to which imagination can soar, while entertwining with the more mundane tale of the characters' lives.  I love the family connection, the fun music and silliness of the characters.  It is escapism at its best in a time when much of the world is moving along at a faster pace caught up in our technology.  Sally Anne Howe is a wonderful choice to co-star with Mr. VanDyke, and her voice is gorgeous.  A must see again for anyone!
B0058YPGP2|5.0|I started watching this show for one of the actors that was in it. I have only seen bits and pieces of the original Teen Wold with Michael J Fox so I can't compare the two. I was almost expecting a show that was more for the teenage girls so I wasn't sure if I would actually like the show but I became hooked. I think it is very well done and offers something for everyone. There is a lot of action in the show and everyone does a great job. I can't wait until season two starts.
B004SKQAJI|4.0|A good concert but not nearly as good as the 1998 Hyde Park, London concert.  I must have misunderstood the description. I expected a different concert from Hyde Park.  This was simply the same concert done on a much smaller, cheaper scale. I thought Flatley, being a great choreographer, could have done something new. I reckon he put this on to satisfy the fans that wanted to see Feet of Flames on stage. That is all very well. However, I feel it should not have been released as a DVD.  I ended up giving it away to my daughter. I will watch the original.
B0057MFA42|5.0|Unfortunately, when Nirvana was around, I was still in my \\"rap\\" phase. I do still like rap, but once hearing Nirvana I was like, \\"Why wasn't I hearing this all along?\\" By then, of course, Kurt was gone. The UNPLUGGED DVD was good, but I yearned for something on BD. THIS IS A GREAT BLU-RAY! It's not jam-packed with extras, but you know, what are you expecting?      Kurt was a great on-stage presence in his own unique way. He kind of kept to himself while things went crazy around him. He appearantly liked circumstantial irony. When a guy falls off stage after jumping up, first he's concerned for him, but when he sees he's OK he looks down like, \\"What did you expect?\\"  This disc is great. Even if your not a huge Nirvana fan like I am, AMAZON has a pretty sweet price to just experiment. I don't see how you can be TOTALLY let down.
B002ZG98UK|3.0|So to begin, I should say I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and even though they barely have any resembalance to the games... still fun. This movie put all the effort on its 3D effects but the movie has so many flaws it was impossible to ignore. My friend actually took off his 3D glasses after 30 minutes and started to write a review of how terrible it was. He refused to finish the movie and went home because everyone else wanted to finish. I have seen better acting in a third grade play and we were laughing about how terrible the actors were. Hell, one segment showed blood on the doors and when they panned to another angle everything behind her that was JUST IN THE SCENE was now gone and empty...   The 3D parts were awesome though and the people watching with me even commented that they were really showing off the capabilities of home based 3D TVs.  Final result... movie is great for 3D but you will probably never watch it ever again. It's an overglorified tech demo.  BTW- The ending makes no sense and if you really think about what happened... kind of impossible in any sense for any of that to happen in the time frame given.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|And I really like Guess Who.  This game probably won't be appropriate for children, as even some adults have a hard time learning/understanding the rules and caring about the game. I would definitely advise parents looking for a game for the family to probably consider a more family friendly game like Jenga or Monopoly.  That being said if I had to compare this board game to anything it'd be like a combination of Monopoly and Risk. It requires strategy, socializing and a lot of luck.  I won't bore anyone with the basic premise of the game, but its definitely easiest to learn with a group of people who've played before. Its not impossible to pick up, but there are certain intricacies of the game that are best explained by those who have played a few times before. The learning curve is steep, but once you've grasped it is one of the most enjoyable games you can play. The only downside is that the game can be very long (sometimes as short as 30 minutes, others as long as an hour and thirty).  I would also be careful of how you put this game together as many of the pieces are cardboard and can rip/tear if not treated carefully. If you're looking to buy this game, I'd recommend trying to play with some friends who own it so you can get a good feel for it. I knew that after the second I learned how to play I was going to buy this game.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I ordered the Deathly Hallows2 about a week before it came out and I received it the day it would have come out in the stores!  I love Amazon's ability to get their products out to customers so fast.  The movie was in perfect condition and I have to force myself not to watch it every  month.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Another perfect book by Stephanie Perkins! Absolutely LOVED this just as much as Anna and the French Kiss. Lola and Cricket were touching and beautiful characters. Can't wait for her next book because i know it it be just as wonderful.
B002ZG981E|4.0|but rather the fact that the BluRay wasn't nearly as impressive as one would have imagined for this movie.  The brainchild of Christopher Nolan that seemingly blew the minds of every person that watched this movie deserved better than the movie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's documentary about sleep and dreams (as interesting as it might be). The bluray really needed some sort of directors commentary for how it was shot, random conceptualizations and normal other stuff that comes along with commentary.  This was one of the few movies I had anticipated watching the commentary more than the movie again. Unfortunately, it lacked that and I was forced to just enjoy a great movie.  The movie itself would earn 5 stars, but due to a lack of commentary I feel as though I can only give this BluRay 4.
B003YHCZD6|5.0|The Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks is a great book to read. Easy read. A lot of people have recommanded to read this book.
0321334876|2.0|You spend most of your time trying to understand his examples than to understand the concepts. Every concept could have been explained by more simple examples that are easy to understand. It takes too much time to understand the examples you get bored and skip that subject. For example, \\"traits can be used in templates to be able to use if statements on types at compile time.\\" The way he explains this simple concept is through advance operator on some STL iterators, in order to explain his example he spends pages explaining how iterators behave until finally. he makes his point. Why is it necessary to talk about iterators so much? find another example where this is not necessary.  In summary, good concepts are mentioned but they are explained in a bad way where you spend more time trying to understand the examples and less time thinking about the concepts. When you are done reading you don't remember any concepts, because you used all your brain power on examples.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow. When Jillian says that her workout will shred you, she isn't kidding! I recently quit my gym membership due to a financial strain, and bought this workout in hopes that I could keep up with my weight loss goals at home. I also borrowed her book \\"Master Your Metabolism\\" from the local library, and applying the principles written there along with this workout dvd, I LOST 7 POUNDS in the first 14 days! Since those first 2 weeks, my weight loss has slowed a little bit, but I know it's because I'm gaining muscle - my clothes are fitting SO much better. WooHoo! I'm now losing about 2 pounds per week. Yes, it's work....but there's nothing more satisfying than to know that you are honestly shedding the pounds and saying Hello to a healthier lifestyle. :) I highly recommend this workout!

1451627289|5.0|I haven't read a King book in many years. After reading this one, I will definitely have to go back and catch up.<br /><br />What if you could go back and change the past? Would you do it? What if by doing so, you changed everything...the good and the bad?<br /><br />The premise of the story involved Jake Epping/George Amberson traveling back in time to prevent the assassination of JFK from happening. During his travel, he prevents some other horrible things as well...but by doing so, he changed everyone's life, including his own.<br /><br />Yes, this book is 800+ pages, but once the story captures you, it won't seem as long. You will be transported back to a simpler time, to lindyhopping, to a world where bad things didn't happen, people trusted each other and a person's word was all it took to make a deal.<br /><br />Jake/George is an English teacher who is asked by a friend to help him prevent the assassination. He travels back to September 1958 and everything changes. There is no horror in this story that King is known for, but some horrible things happen... or do they? There is also a love story that unfolds...but the ending may surprise you. Friends and enemies are made, bets are won, lives are lost and changed forever.<br /><br />I loved how the story unfolded and \\"reset\\" several times and each time a string to the original past was left. If you like time travel with lots of \\"what if's\\" thrown in, I think that you will enjoy this story.
0439023521|5.0|All I can say is WOW!  I never used to read books for leisure, but this book has transformed me!  From the first moment, I could not put this book down.  I found myself turning off the TV in favor of this book which I have never done before.  The book starts out with a summary of Katniss Everdeen's life in the future country of Paneam's District 12.  Collins describes the Hunger Games which are actually a punishment to the citizens for revolting 74 years ago.  You can probably guess what happens next so I won't spoil it for you!  In all honesty, if you haven't read a book in a while, or simply want a good read; you need to buy this book!
0670022411|3.0|A Discovery of Witches is full of complex world building that encompasses heavy doses of history, science, alchemy with a twist on traditional myths for vampires and witches making it more of a plot driven story with many mysteries in store for the reader. The characters are multi-dimensional with a wide range of personalities from likable to terrifying.<br /><br />For the most of part, there was a lot of background setup while following the reluctant heroine Diana Bishop into the discovery of her heritage as a witch. Diana has been stubbornly determined to not use her magic since a tragic event from her childhood, trying to be as human as possible while being surrounded by supernatural beings. In this reality, as far as the world is concerned, the three supernatural beings witches, vampires and daemons do not exist except in fiction and they'd like to keep it that way.<br /><br />In the course of her work as a scholar, while in Oxford researching several alchemy books, one book being \\"Ashmole 782,\\" Diana runs into Matthew Clairmont a standoffish vampire with a strong craving for wine. There begins the unraveling of all Diana's efforts to avoid magic because her interest in \\"Ashmole 782\\" causes a huge interest from the major supernatural players from all three races, some not so healthy for Diana.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches was a little slow moving for me in that there was a lot \\"talking\\" and detailed scenery with only a sporadic showing of \\"fast moving action.\\" Myself, I prefer much more action than I found this story. There are extravagant details given to surroundings, wines, teas and various others, that at times made me feel bogged down with too much detail. That being said, I did enjoy how Harkness was able to enrich the overall story arc with mix of history as a back drop. While much focus is given to the romance between Diana and Matthew, it was just a bit off for me. I didn't quite buy into Diana and Matthew as couple, while I did like them individually I kept feeling like I had missed something in the sparking of their romance.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches wasn't reading at a pace I prefer and I don't think it reads like a book you'd typically find in the paranormal romance genre. That being said, overall I think a wide range of readers, even those who normally don't indulge in romances, would enjoy reading A Discovery of Witches, especially history buffs and wine enthusiasts. It's a good start to a trilogy that definitely has the makings to become much more.missed something in the sparking of their romance.

B004DSX5B6|4.0|As a single gal of nearly 30, I've learned if you want it done, do it yourself. After a few years of fixing things myself I found that I was missing a good multi tool for little jobs around the house and on location for my job... being a fan of Bear and his adorable accent, I found myself drawn to his line of knives and recently purchased myself the Ultimate Multi-Tool. After light use thus far I have a few helpful tips for any ladies out there looking to do the same with purchasing this multi-tool.<br /><br />1. The ease of movement in each tool and the pilers is great. Very comfortable on non-man hands and easy to hold and use.<br /><br />2. I love the spring loading pilers and the fact that this has wire cutters is so useful.<br /><br />3. The scissor design and the way it's folded into the knife is nice and is easy to complete the fold out, however if you were to use these for any length of time your \\"cutting\\" finger would really be hurting. There is no padding on the moving handle so to use these for more than just a few cuts would be very uncomfortable.<br /><br />4. The range of tools is nice, though I'm not sure what you're suppose to do with the lanyard tool? Bear, I'm sure, has some amazing life saving use for it like tying a bit of cordage to a boat, using a tree for leverage and putting it from 3' of thick mud using nothing but this lanyard tool and his pinkie. The large and small flat head screw drive is very nice to have, many times I've found myself with a flat head that was just too big to use with a screw. I kinda think it's a bummer that you have to raise every tool starting with the knife to get to the tools in the middle or the far end of each side, I know that's pretty standard with multi-tools and at least the tools are on the outside of this one.<br /><br />5. MAJOR BUMMER, the weak beware: My one complaint with this (and I'm not looking for something to complain about but this is huge) - Not having very strong muscles in my hand or a finger tip made of steel, I find it VERY DIFFICULT to close the tools. There is a metal sliding lock knob that you're suppose to push in and pull down to get the tool to release and lower... I find it impossible to do.. not only with one hand but I'm having to use my shirt over my finger as to not rip my nail off and try for a few minutes to get these to work. I'm not sure if it's a defect in my knife or if this was made for those with herculean strength but it can't be done.<br /><br />6. I share in the disappointment that others have commented on in regards to the case.. there is a little pocket inside, which I assume is to hold the survival guide, and without the guide in the pocket it's tough to get the knife in the case. It gets caught and you have to struggle with it. But WITH the guide in the case, it's impossible.. getting the knife in the case can't be done. I'm not an extreme survivalist so I have no use for the sheathing knife but I really love the case that's included with it and the fact that it has a knife sharpener and a fire starter in the handle. I really wish they would redo this case that included those things into it with a faster and easier pack and unpack motion.<br /><br />All in all, the locking feature is a major fail... Bear, us ladies want to be able to use this too ya know... and the case is pretty lame, nothing exciting about it and it's basically unusable for someone who would use this all the time... unless you use your multi tool to cut out that annoying extra pocket inside (HEY..BRILLIANT!) but in the end - a good multi tool to have with you.close the tools.

B0001CCY7E|5.0|This is a stunning album. If you are a Dances with wolves fan you can close your eye's and just listen and see the movie through the music. Listening to John Barry's work is an amazing journey and I can't say enough about how great this Album is. I highly recommend this to everyone.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is a marvel; it's an original idea that works as both an action movie and philosophical drama.  The plot is admittedly far-fetched, yet if we accept the movie's premise the plot is sound.  The acting is fine, the direction great, the effects supurb, and the editing flawless.    Watch this movie.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|Received fast. So far I've only had time to listen to this once. This is a little different direction than the other CD's, with some new and interesting style music from them that some I liked, and others were OK. And some of the more recognizable style that I truly liked. All in all a good sound, but will have to spend more time listening to it. Have yet to buy any bands album that I liked every song on it.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Everyone now knows the plot of this movie.  It's basically Hamlet in Africa.  With giant cats.  What needs repeating here is that the Lion King takes its plot and makes it sublime.  It takes its characters and makes you care about them.  It sprinkles in humor without losing the gravity of the overall movement of the film.  The Lion King is a perfect example of the hero's journey, and a film for the ages.  And for the record, the Blu Ray is amazing.  It is worth the price just for the first 5 minutes!

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech reassures me that Hollywood can still tell a compelling story.  I'm not sure that Colin Firth will ever do a better job than he does in this film -he draws the viewer in and helps us feel the terror that a stammerer has for public speaking.  This is everything a movie drama should be.  Simply wonderful movie making.

B004EPZ07U|4.0|Sometimes a movie trailer is a movie's worst enemy.  The trailer for Green Lantern was phenomenal, and really got my excitement level up for the finished movie.  The movie itself was formulaic and less than original, with many plot holes.  That said, Green Lantern does not really attempt to be more than it is.  And it simply is a fun summer action movie that follows a time-tested plot formula.  There were many moments that the critic in me railed against, yet overall the little boy in me who still loves superheroes liked it.  3 1/2 stars.
B001ER4CTI|4.0|I purchased this product as a collector's edition for the great price. Upon arrival of the package (which was in perfect shape) I opened the box. To my surprise the original box that the movie was in was damaged. If not for being a collector's edition it wouldn't have mattered. For the price it wasn't worth the hassle of going through the process of returning it and waiting for another shipment. It was to be a gift for a \\"300\\" enthusiast so I had to find another gift for him. Now it's part of my collection for viewing purposes. This was extremely unusual for amazon. Over the many years of using their service, this is the first time I've had a problem.

B005YVTHT0|1.0|UPDATE: After about a year of very light use, the steering wheel broke. The wheel no longer sends the right signal to the computer for it to recognize the wheel as a joystick. Some lights light up initially that never came on before. But no connection is made. That's a shame, as we really liked this wheel.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: This gaming steering wheel is a nice idea. You hold it in your hands, without any connection to anything. An accelerometer inside it can tell, by checking the force of gravity, which way you are turning the wheel. Brakes and throttle you use with pedals to the left and right.<br /><br />Not only is it a nice idea, it works! This wheel is well-engineered, and it gives you very good control as you steer your gaming car down the road. The only problem I have seen so far is that if you let the wheel tilt too much, it affects the steering. That's to be expected, given the way the accelerometer measures the amount of steering. That means that too much tilt backward or forward will affect the measurement of steering turn.<br /><br />A disadvantage of this approach is that you have to hold the steering wheel up. It's not very heavy. Still, after a while, my hands start to droop. Then the problem mentioned above starts to happen. I understand that I can buy a stand for the wheel. Although that defeats the purpose a bit, I'm considering doing that.<br /><br />With the way electric cars work, a steering wheel like this may be just the thing for real cars. Light, unobtrusive, but fully functional. Much better than the dangerous, bulky steering wheels we have now.
1451627289|5.0|11-22-63 had me hooked in the beginning, got a bit long in the middle, and pulled me back in the end. Stephen King has a way of making you think, that I haven't found with other authors. This is an excellent novel. It's a pretty cool story that isn't so much about dissecting the Kennedy assassination as the title might make you believe. It's much more. Do yourself a favor. Read this book.
B003Y3AZSW|5.0|What I like most about the cutting board set it that it stands up vertically. Additionally, the set is nice enough to leave out on my counter tops in my kitchen. Thus, it's nice having the boards easily accessible and visible. There is a different set very similar to this one, for a bit less, but, the boards are smaller. The cutting boards that come with this set are large enough for me and my wife, but if I were cooking meals for a larger group more frequently, I would probably be wising for a larger board.   In summary, one gets 4 nice cutting boards in a sharp looking vertical stand that is sharp enough to leave out, resulting in the boards being easily accessible while cooking.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|I gave this to my husband to try out, and while he really liked it, there were a few things he didn't like about it.<br /><br />It is a comfortable watch - the band is fabric on the outside and leather on the inside, which means that if you happen to get hot while working or while outside, your sweat won't soak up into the fabric as much (thus becoming stinky). The watch dials  are fairly easy to figure out (I thought), and the timer is easy to use - a bit awkward though, depending on which wrist you wear the watch on. This is a big watch, though, and my husband can't wear it all the time, as he works with his hands a lot and would get in the way of machinery and such. My husband didn't find that it was too heavy (most likely because of the band material). He will be wearing it for special occasions, since he can't wear it at his day-to-day job.

144234430X|5.0|[[ASIN:1451627289 11/22/63: A Novel]]The only book I have ever read that Stephen King wrote is his \\"On Writing\\" Book (4 and half stars; 1/5 scale) and listened to EVERY banquet and crumb of writing advice he has given out to aspiring writers.<br />I don't read \\"horror\\". I've had enough in my real-life.<br />So, even though I didn't read his genre--His novel, 11-22-63 is a five star story (1/5/scale). I did buy it on Audible because my eyes get tired, and in general, I'd rather relax and listen to a story; or listen to a story while I am doing some mundane task than listen to music or watch TV.<br /> This story, 11-22-63 by Stephen King, is the best story I've read, heard or viewed in ten years! I couldn't turn it off! Now, I want the print version: Because I love words that are the perfect combination, the \\"perfect bite.\\"<br />Bravo! Mr. King!<br /><br />Note: I ordered the print version! Seriously; don't try to sterotype a writer--King delivers complete satiation for the suspense-thriller reader. Horror, I don't know about that I don't read horror. But this story is on my five shelf (1/5 scale) and my five star shelf has only a few, word, world and syntax delectibles on it--and 11-22-63 is on that shelf! Again, Bravo Mr. King!

0060531053|5.0|Our roommate had a copy of the Joy of Homebrewing, and we have been using it for the past year.  This year we decided to get our own.  We started out with the Prickly Pear Mead recipe which I thoroughly recommend to anyone who has access to Prickly Pear fruits!!  We made a batch of that and a batch of the Antipodal last year and have been saving them for special occassions.  This year we did 4 batches totaling 20 gallons!  We did 4 different recipes and will showcase them at our wedding reception in June!  They won't have the ideal time for aging, but based on last year's batch, we think that enough will be done and aged a few months in time:-)
1451627289|2.0|I expect a Stephen King novel to immediately build a high level of interest and expectation--and a sense of regret when it is fininished.  This book plods along, making me wish it would hurry up and get to the point--and over.  I managed to trudge my way to the conclusion, but would not pick it up again--I think he could have told the same story, in a more interesting manner, in a lot less space.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case does its job well. It protects the screen and holds the Kindle firmly in place. The stand feature is easy to use and a welcome idea, since I do a lot of reading while eating. The price should be $20.00 tops.
1451648537|3.0|I am almost 1/3rd of the way through this book and it is.....boring. I am no closer to knowing the real Steve Jobs, other than his mean and demanding side, than fly to the moon. I really don't care about his search for Englightenment, his body odor, his distain of parents and their sacrifices for him, nor his hi-jinks w/ Wozniack and eventual dismissal of him. I AM interested in the founding of Apple, its ups and downs, and its rescue from ruin. Evidently, I won't get to that later after plying through the minutae of the travails that assaulted the man and his engineers. Frankly, I would like to know more personal stuff, how the family impacted on his progress, and, of course, his dedication to excellence while dealing w/ the demons of genius. Sigh! Will wait for the next book to give me some insights.
B004XQO90O|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It deals with some futuristic technology that you could only wish we have presently.  You will be guess who dunnit all the way to the end.  The ending was shocking, you could never have expected to see it coming.  Worth the buy. Worth adding to your dvd or blu ray collection.
B004EPZ08E|4.0|Horrible Bosses was far better than advertised.  When it came out in the theaters, I didn't know anyone who'd seen it so I didn't really know what to expect.  All I knew was that there were some really good actors in it, but most importantly, Jennifer Aniston was playing a \\"slutty b!tch\\", and that alone would be worth the price of admission.  I've watched it a few times now and it gets funnier each time.  If you are a fan of any of these actors, i think you'll enjoy it.  Strongly recommended!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read all of Stephen King's novels, novellas, and short stories.  He is one of my favorite writers.  While some of his work still gives me the creeps (e.g. \\"It\\"  -I'll never trust clowns, ever!, and \\"The Shining\\") I find most of them are like reading about long lost friends who have once again popped into my life.  This book is on the same level for me as \\"The Stand\\", my all-time favorite book of his.  You really get to know the characters and care what happens.  There is a moral to the story and it's a believable one.  This is worth the time to sit and read - I guarantee that you won't be able to put it down.  I read it in two sittings!

0553386794|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it delves deeply into a plot driven by political intrigue.  The character development was exceptional.  Martin is an excellent writer and he paints a very vivid picture of every aspect of his mythical world.  I would have enjoyed more battles and action in the book, however I imagine he is working up to that in the upcoming novels.  This may be a challenging read for individuals who prefer a faster paced novel, however I found it quite rewarding.  I have purchased Clash of Kings and am looking forward to reading it.<br />Note:  This book features vivid sexual content, including depictions of violent rape.  Parents or individuals sensitive to such materials should consider this prior to reading.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|Okay, I admit it.  With Helen Mirren, we were inclined to like the movie - especially after the brief trailers shown on TV.  What we did not expect was to find ourselves completely engrossed in the way this elegantly told story unfolded, in an artful series of flashbacks and current-day drama woven together in a seamless tapestry. I agree with one of the other reviewers - if this were a book, it would be impossible to put down.  The plot twists, and there are more than one, don't telegraph themselves up front, which heightens the overall sense of drama, and the movie doesn't let up, even in the last few minutes of the film.  \\"The Debt\\" is not only a must in one's DVD collection, but deserves to be seen on the big screen.  Bravery, treachery and redemption - this movie has it all.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I discovered this show on \\"On Demand\\" and enjoyed it so much that I ordered both seasons.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  It's a sort of musical sit-com, full of funny songs and quirky characters.  The humor is a bit on the dry style, reflecting the Commonwealth origins of the creators.  The main characters make a humorous pair and the supporting cast in quirky and funny, especially Rhys Darby.  While the show may be a bit slow-paced for people who prefer quicker comedy, I found this show to be really delightful to watch.  I bought a few copies to give as gifts and one for myself.  I have gone back and watched both seasons a couple of times so it has been worth owning on DVD.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Very easy to use, and has many features!  Only feature I'd like to see added is a transparency control for all brushes and paints.  Otherwise it is the best App I've found so far.
1419702238|1.0|I really enjoyed the previous books in the Wimpy Kid series, but this one is a big disappointment. Seems that the author ran out of material, and should have stopped at book 5 but couldn't because the series are so popular and sell so well. This one (#6) is just lazy -- no story line and lots of cliches. Both adults and teens in my family agree: it seems like it was rushed to get printed in time for Christmas to guarantee big sales. Sad end to what used to be a very creative and very funny series.
0385484518|5.0|Great book, very insightful.  Makes you think about your life.  Loved it.  Read it for our Book Group and everyone enjoyed it.  We had 7 ladies in our group last month for our book group.
B004GXL8GC|4.0|I bought this as a gift and was not disappointed. In fact, I had to buy three more sets for the kids.  Figures are from the Smurf movie.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This was a great movie!  It was nonstop action from start to finish, and was just an amazing story and a great end to the series.  I do not want to give out any information about the movie (it is hard to mention anything without giving out too much information about the movie).  This set included the Blu-Ray copy as well as the DVD copy, I like having both since I love the quality of my Blu-Ray player, and using my older devices that only support DVD as well.  I am not using the UltraViolet copy (my iPhone quickly runs out of space with movies), but from playing with the Flixster app and UltraViolet website, it seems that I can download a local copy to my iPhone (through the Flixster app), I started the download, but cancelled it since I do not want to waste space on the device, you can also stream over the internet with it.  To be honest, I did prefer when movies just came with an iTunes card code so I could get it through iTunes, that seemed easier.  However, like I mentioned I normally do not use the digital copies with the movie.<br /><br />In the end this is a great movie, and is a must for all who love movies or the Harry Potter series!!  I am glad to see this movie, but I am sad that this super fun and entertaining story is over...
B004HO6I2E|4.0|I was expecting a sophomoric, sight-gag-ridden waste of time and boy, was I ever WRONG.  The humor was well-written, and yes, there were plenty of sight-gags, but even these were pretty-well developed.  Definitely not for children.  There is plenty of nudity and the F-word is rampant, but it is at the same time, charming and dare I say, delightful?  It has elevated the body-switching genre, gave me such an enjoyable evening.  Jason Bateman is utterly believable in both roles, as was Ryan Reynolds.  I had heard Jason Bateman on NPR discussing his role in this movie and his real-life as a father to a five-year old daughter which is why Jason nailed parenting so well in the movie.  I will definitely be buying this movie to watch often whenever I need a good laugh and a reminder of what life was like raising small children, and being single and 'contantly out there.....'  Life is funny, for sure!

B002ZG981E|4.0|It entertained me, which is pretty much the main purpose of a Hollywood movie. Did it make me think? Not really. The movie is as simple as it comes, though some people would argue with me that it's \\"complex and mind-provoking\\". I beg to differ. It only confused me when they rambled on about dream terms in a \\"matter of fact\\" way, but it eventually plays itself out. The ending was the worse part of the movie. One of those \\"let's give the audience something to think about by giving them an ending that's open to interpretation\\". I honestly don't care to discuss the movie so that pretty much failed miserably. Don't get me wrong, I love to discuss stories and hear other people's opinions. But this I didn't care much for.   Inception is a good movie. That's it, nothing more. It's entertaining, kinda cool. I wish they had casted a different actor over Ellen Page though. I am not a big fan of her. Just don't expect too much of a mind blower from this movie. If you really want to think, try the Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus.

B001LF347E|5.0|I absolutely love this show! It has a lot to offer adventure, love, hate, revenge. A new version of Arthur and his knights, with Merlin right along side.
B003PIUC02|5.0|What can I say about this show from a woman's purely entertainment perspective?  1. Andy Whitfield is hot (R.I.P.),  2. Manu Bennet is hot and 3. Dustin Claire (from God's of the Arena) is hot!!  Some viewers may be put off by the gratuitous nudity and violence, but for me it was a plus.  Aside from all the eye candy, this is a great series with plenty of action, scheming and good story-telling.  Ladies, if you love looking at hardbodies then this is THE show for you!  Can't wait until season 3!!
B000JIHP88|5.0|We bought this mobile 4 years ago for my newborn daughter. We used it for almost 2 years every day and night. Then I packed it in the attic, even forgetting to take the batteries out. Now, 2 years later, I am expecting a son so I wiped it with a wet wipe, installed it on the crib again and, with the new batteries, it works just like new. The music is soothing, not too loud on the higher volume setting. I was amazed! I totally recommend it!

B00479SVBU|5.0|I was looking for a way for my husband to be able to take his music with him as he goes.  This gadget is perfect.  I am currently ripping all of his old music from CD's onto a SD card that he can plug into this FM transmitter and have all his old favorites at the push of a few buttons.  I have already tested this product in his truck and preset the FM frequencies.  It was easy (once I read the instructions).  My only warning to other consumers - be careful of its size.  It was a little larger than I expected.
0307949508|4.0|Again I have upgraded my initial rating of THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE upon re-reading the sophomore installment to now classis Millennium Trilogy. Larrson's choice of Lisbeth's love interest admittedly still bothers me, but I fully understand the choice now. Larrson is still exploring misogynism and its vile effects. I first thought that since bloody Kalle Blomkvist broke Salander simply went back to her former lover, because men constantly hurt her, but her lover needed to be who Larrson chose for the story to work.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist and a young journalist are preparing a special issue of Millennium Magazine entirely devoted to the ugly sex slave trade. But when the young man and his girlfriend are found murdered in their apartment and evidence left behind links Salander to the crime (and possibly an earlier murder), Blomkvist won't believe that his friend had any involvement even though he hasn't seen Lisbeth in over a year. He decides to run a parallel investigation to the police's investigation...that is if he can find her. Lisbeth has always decided who may see her and where and when. Her new expensive apartment with the name children will understand: Pippi Long stockings ring a bell, readers? Mikael finally sees her one night, but Salander eludes him and her own would-be-murderer. `Where has Lisbeth Salander been all this time and why is she avoiding him,' Kalle Blomkvist wonders.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander has been traveling, maturing, and trying to solve Fermat's Last Theorem. She is still fighting to protect women as the hurricane hits the Caribbean island that she has been staying on. Her maternal instinct surprised me and I found her changed appearance somewhat amusing. She is still keeping tabs on the tattooed Bjurman and the incident \\"all the evil is front and center exposing a high leveled government cover-up and corruption in the social services system that made her a ward of the Swedish state.<br /><br />THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE starts off with a dramatic punch and does not let up the suspenseful pace until the dramatic d&eacute;nouement. Larrson built on his characters from THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO rather than letting stagnate or doing things that did not represent growth. I am looking forward to re-reading HORNET to see if my first reaction changes, but one thing I know to be true the Millennium Trilogy will have a prominent place in my permanent library.matic punch and does not let up the suspenseful pace until the dramatic dénouement.

B005NKIQ26|5.0|What a wonderful album from the upbeat \\"Under the Mistletoe' to the haunting \\"Silent Night\\" at the end.  In between there  are wonderful collaborations with Boyz II Men on \\"Fa la La\\", with Usher on \\"Chestnuts Roasting...\\", a duet with Mariah Carey and  a snappy version of \\"Drummer Boy\\" with Busta Rhymes.  And of course Justin is terrific.
B0026IA0QS|5.0|I've been waiting some time (in my area) for this to be released on DVD...it's been a long time. I will say that I was just as horrified, in love, and Eraseheaded as I was the first to tenth time watching it. Good stuff, but not for the weak of heart or close-minded. This film could be difficult for those who have never had a hard time, been hungry, homeless, desperate, madly in love (or lust), come close to losing your mind - or the lot. Love it as one would \\"Freaks\\" or \\"Lost Highway\\" with a dash of \\"Man on a Wire\\". I consider this a naked piece of art...where the artist has the guts to stand naked, \\"warts and all\\", and still love him. I do!
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|Before you buy this book (or any of his other books) take a look at Seth Godin's blog. If his blog appeals to you so will this book. If it doesn't, go spend your money elsewhere.  \\"Linchpin\\" is for cogs who are tired of being cogs and want something more. Cogs as in one of many, easily replaceable, and above all average and not special. Cogs as in tomorrow will be a copy of yesterday.  Seth provides two main insights with this book, namely:  1. How the lizard brain is holding you back, how it's doing it, and how you can fight back  2. How to become a linchpin--an artist, a giver, someone who isn't easily replaceable and who others depend on and cherish  A strength and weakness of this book (and why I felt a one-star deduction was appropriate) is that it reads like a blog, full of small sections. This makes it very easy to read in short intervals but deducts from the flow and structure. I suspect this may be more of a reader preference issue than anything else. I also prefer this type of books to be concise and compact, like \\"Rework\\" by Jason Fried and Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals, and would prefer Seth to tighten up his writing just a bit.  Still, I do love this book and recommend it to anyone who wants to escape from their shell, do amazing things in their life, make a real difference in the lives of others, and in 40 years look back with a smile.  Good job, Seth!
B005HV6Y84|4.0|Don't pay too much attention to the negative reviews. I'm a Muse fan too, and maybe the other Twilight soundtracks are better, but people should base their reviews on what's there, not on what's not there (the latter is important, but shouldn't be focused on too much).<br />I bought the CD for \\"A Thousand Years,\\" and didn't expect much otherwise, but most of the songs are good or very good.<br /><br />1) \\"Endtapes\\" by The Joy Formidable (4:10): 8.5/10.<br />A slightly weird, but very cool song.<br />It starts things off right.<br /><br />2) \\"Love Will Take You\\" by Angus & Julia Stone (4:31): 9/10.<br />A really sweet and good song.<br />I love the music. It makes me think of a casual day out in the country.<br /><br />3) \\"It Will Rain\\" by Bruno Mars (4:19): 9/10.<br />Bruno, as usual, sings with conviction. The song is heartfelt and easy to listen to.<br /><br />4) \\"Turning Page\\" by Sleeping At Last (4:16): 8/10.<br />The lyrics are great, and the song picks up steam at the end.<br /><br />5) \\"From Now On\\" by The Features (3:22): 8.5/10.<br />An upbeat song with a driving beat.<br /><br />6) \\"A Thousand Years\\" by Christina Perri (4:46): 9.5/10.<br />I noticed right away when I heard the song on the radio how simple it is. Still, it's quite touching, and I'm not even a fan of the movies (I'm sure that I would like them, but I've only seen bits and pieces of Twilight).<br />The vocals are pure and beautiful, and the song is arranged wonderfully.<br /><br />7) \\"Neighbors\\" by Theophilus London (3:57): 8/10.<br />Despite the vocals being a little rough (it's also odd that only the word \\"neighbor\\" is used in the song), the song is pretty solid.<br /><br />8) \\"I Didn't Mean It\\" by The Belle Brigade (3:34): 9/10.<br />A fun and rollicking rock song.<br />The lead singer sounds a lot like Macy Gray, and this song should be played in bars.<br /><br />9) \\"Sister Rosetta (2011 Version)\\" by Noisettes (2:59): 9/10.<br />I like the noise that the Noisettes make here. The song is fast and slick (I can picture people dancing to it).

His new CD Christmas is a wonderful because it brings us back to the days of Bing Crosby and Dean Martin; the days when Christmas music was sung beautifully.   Purchase this CD as a gift for anyone who loves beautiful Christmas songs and while you are at it, buy one for yourself. I was glad I purchased it at Amazon because I got it cheaper and it came to my door without having to fight the crowds.

1451648537|5.0|I haven't finished reading this book, left about a 12 chapters from chapter six but I would like to write a review.  Before reading this book, there are \\"Apple Confidential 2.0\\" by Owen Linzmayer and \\"return to the little kingdom\\" by Michael Moritz. I have read both.  After having read a few 'complaints' blog on this book, I wondered into a bookstore, turn to a random page and started reading. After three pages, I liked it so I bought a Kindle version.  It has some business information about how/why Apple is what it is today. There are interesting information that you won't know about it unless you are involved. You won't know it even if you are in Apple! For that, this book is worth reading already.  There are people who dislike the details of Steve's personal and/or official encounters. There are people who think Walter Isaacsson does not 'understand' Steve. I think the Author stays honest about what he has heard and learned. We have this false sense of what a genius should be.  (mostly we should blame the past media to 'distort' reporting only the good side of famous people)  Steve has strong opinions on everything. Steve is brutally candor. It is clearly presented in the book. It is refreshing. It is human.  Guess Steve would be happier if people consider him an artist than an visionary or an innovator.  Besides, artists seem to be able to dodge denouncement than an innovator, because, well, they are artists.

This excellent film won an academy award and proved without a shadow of a doubt that those responsible should be brought to justice.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I was prompted to read this by friends and reviews. I got about half way through it when I stopped reading it, read two other books, and then came back to this one to begrudgingly finish it. The climax happens nowhere near the end, to the point that there could easily be another twist in the story... but it never comes. The book was a disappointment.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|R.E.D. (Retired and Extremely Dangerous) stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovitch. It is clever, at times brutal but often quite funny. The listed actors are joined by other very fine actors who  deliver fine performances, in both the comic parts as well as the more serious moments.  The idea is that these former C.I.A. agents must be eliminated for reasons that must remain obscure  (they have to figure it out for themselves, then they'll tell you).  It delivers quite a few laughs, and not a little suspense along the way. Well done!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has seriously been the best book I've read in quite some time. I wouldn't say I'm an avid reader, but I honestly couldn't stop reading this book. It was really difficult to put down, and really easy to just get lost within the characters and story.
0553573403|4.0|I am not a huge fantasy fan. I read only about half of LOTR (even though I love the movies and own the extended editions) because I couldn't get into the long prose and mystical happenings with creatures great and small.<br /><br />I must say that A Game of Thrones blew me away. It sounded really interesting and I never even heard of it before the HBO series (I decided to read it before watching it, and I'm glad I did). The characters and the land of Westeros is brilliantly detailed and developed. I felt like I was there and I could vividly see the details of the various castles and countryside.<br /><br />If you are interested in epic storytelling and a taste of \\"historical fiction\\" with some light fantasy elements then this is a must read. There is a bit of weird, mystical, fantasy elements in it (and the last chapter was ..... WOW.... but overall it isn't overpowering or too out there to enjoy (if you don't normally like that kind of thing).<br /><br />I was originally intimidated by the 800 page length, but I must say once I got engrossed in the story I raced through it.<br /><br />NOTE ON THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK: I bought the mass market paperback edition and at 800 pages they made the print so small that it is really hard to read (I'm only 31 and JUST got reading glasses for the first time but it was still hard to read). I didn't have any pages fall apart but then I am careful with large paperbacks to not bend/break the spine too much. I did get some noticeable cracking and tearing on the spine so if you are the kind of person who wants to \\"display\\" this book with a clean spine then I advise you get the hardcover version.

B004Y1USJE|5.0|I am a long standing progessive rock fan, particularly 70's music from Rush, Genesis, Yes, and the likes. Yes switched things up in the 80's with 90215, but they have returned to form with Fly From Here. Although mellowed, there is still the fabulous song writing and muscianship of years past. There is a fair amount of piano work on this album, and the guitar remains crisp and polished. I also like the instrumental songs thrown in throughout. \\"Fly From Here\\" is a great song about an abandoned airfield, and although Jon Anderson's voice is no longer on lead, Benoit David has a similar range and a great voice in his own right. My favorite song is Chris Squire's, \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\\". This tune should strike home with any middle-aged married man. \\"Hour of Need\\" and \\"Into the Storm\\" are also fabulous tracks. I can't stop listening to this CD, and I'm not so much amazed with the continued musical talent in Yes, but their ongoing creative abilities. This blends the past with the present and should please any Yes fan of former years.
B000000IRK|5.0|The Who/ Tommy/ the original 1969 recording (Mobile Fidelity single Gold disc): War, deception, murder(?), religion, sexual abuse, drug abuse, medical quackery, insanity, fame, the herd mentality, rebellion, Townshend's Rock Opera has everything...including lots of loose ends.  That is not a problem for this work however, as its parts join together well (even if it does not `flow') and it is immensely entertaining with more than enough ambiguity to allow the listener to fill the gaps with his own story.  With all its obvious flaws, this is still a Great album and a groundbreaking musical adventure.  You should own this one.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best CD of this work is the MCA / Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab Gold Ultradisc (if you can find it and afford it).  However, there are a few other CD versions of the original Tommy that are very good as well.<br /><br />One more note: Be aware that there are several \\"Tommy\\" performances out there.  This one is the original 1969 version performed by The Who.  There is also a movie soundtrack version, which is very different.  There is a Broadway type musical version of Tommy that is on CD.  There are no less than two Rock `various artists' performances on LP and/or CD.  Therefore, make sure you know which of these you want and be diligent is selecting the right version.

B0000009NF|5.0|David Bowie/ Space Oddity (RYCO - RCD 10131)/ (Bonus tracks):  In this album, Bowie gives us some of the best songs he will ever write.  This is not the hit filled Glam rock that he will soon be doing (and doing very well), this is where the songwriter shines.  The song `Space Oddity' is a great song, but those who discount the rest of the album are making a huge mistake.<br /><br />The RYCO version of the CD has a very good presentation of the original 10 songs, plus three fine Bonus cuts (\\"Conversation Piece\\", and \\"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\\" and \\"...part 2\\").  The Rycodisc is more complete than the original album and less cluttered than the `40th anniversary' double CD.

B00028U6B8|5.0|Jefferson Airplane/ Volunteers:  Volunteers is another one of Jefferson Airplane's classic albums.  This one is as good, and as important to have, as their Surrealist Pillow album.  This album, released in 1969, is a perfect combination of Hippie idealism and counter culture frustration.  Despite the dated nature of its creation, the songs themselves remain relevant and entertaining.<br /><br />There are four versions of the album available (as of 2011):<br /><br />First, there is the CD of the album with its classic 10 tracks.<br /><br />Second, there is the CD with 5 live bonus songs from their Nov. 28 & 29, 1969 gigs at the Fillmore East.<br /><br />Third, there is the double CD called \\"Jefferson Airplane: The Woodstock Experience\\" which has the original Volunteers CD (no bonus tracks) plus a second CD that contains the Airplanes' complete performance from the Woodstock Festival of 1969.<br /><br />Forth, there is the very fine Mobile Fidelity Gold disk that contains the albums original ten tracks.<br /><br />In whatever way you chose to buy the album, you will have a Great one.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This video is awesome! A must-see by all. It shows that with persistence and determination, one can overcome ANY situation. It made me cry to see the poverty and hardships suffered by the boys, which is just a depiction of what occurs in real life. Gr8 movie!
B006C45MRE|3.0|I have no problem mixing the Western & Alien genres, and I have no problem with the cast or acting in the film...but something is lacking. There are some slow spots and the action doesn't really pick up until towards the end, but there is some suspense albeit not much. I think Craig and Ford are fantastic in the roles they are assigned, but the film overall reminds me of how audiences viewed Predator when it first appeared in the 80's. The audience was kind of torn between \\"is is it sci-fi or is it action-adventure?\\" Of course in time we all grew to love the Predator franchise as a hybrid film. I think Cowboys and Aliens will be more appealing 10 years from now than it does present day, which in a way is a praise. It reminds me of a B movie on steroids and good B movies stand the test of time. If this becomes a cult classic we will have to wait and see, but I think it is setting a stage for future films to mix genres in a modern, appealing way.
B0042K4QK4|4.0|I saw that this series had just one review, and it wasn't a great one. So I had to chip in. I watched this on Netflix before getting Amzn prime.  Really enjoyed it.  Sure, it's no 24, Lost, or even Prison Break. BUT it's only a half-step below.  Nikita is fairly well written, decent action sequences, got some atmosphere and suspense AND you can view it HD on Amazon. Wish I had waited!

B0000714BP|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000714BP To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar]]<br />  I have an extensive movie collection.  As might be expected, some stand out \\"head above the crowd\\" as favorites.  TO WONG FOO THANKS FOR EVERYTHING  is one of two I put at the top of the (light/funny/ease the stress) list.  Patrick Swayze is absolutely one of the most memorable women I've ever seen.  He is not a man playing a woman....he IS a woman.  (It reminds me of a scene in the Broadway show RHINOCEROS, when I saw the actor sitting in front of an imaginary mirror putting on his stage make-up - and he did not turn himself into someone pretending to be a rhino - he BECAME the animal.  This is like that.  Memorable.  The other actors also do an incredible job.  Wesley Snipes is as funny as I've ever seen him.  And \\"the little Latin boy\\" is just as amazing.  Perfect casting in a funny movie that carries a worthwhile message - and makes you laugh while it's giving you something to think about.  What more could anyone ask!

B005KJZDXK|5.0|Finally a Christmas cd where the singing is straight-up and the arrangements are simple and appropriate which let's the songs speak for themselves.  The reason many of these songs are classics is because they have great lyrics and bring back pleasant memories of the holidays.  I'm tired of hearing so many artists wailing and adding notes and crap that aren't in the original songs.  The only thing you need to add is a voice so if you like Zooey's voice you'll like this cd.

0756405890|2.0|Here's the thing about Rothfuss: He writes really descriptively. You want something described? Scenery? People? Thoughts? Adventures that may happen at some point? Oh yes he is good at that. Problem is, he took over 700 pages to tell what barely qualifies as a story. This is a very long book and I am truly amazed at how little actually happens. Seriously, over 700 pages, mainly talking about the adventures that Kvothe MAY have and bad, evil creatures who he MAY encounter. Rothfuss got me pretty excited about these adventures....but they never happen. Indeed, almost nothing happens in this book other than great descriptions of people, scenery, thoughts, fears and....descriptions of stuff that would be damned exciting IF ANY OF THEM HAPPENED. But they don't. I don't get the rave reviews here, and I do not get this book.

0446613444|4.0|This was my first dive into a Harry Bosch adventure and I'm hooked. The story line was very interesting and had just enough twists and turns to lead the reader on to the next page and then the next. As a former law enforcement officer I can appreciate the times Harry Bosch had with the brass in this adventure and in trying to solve the case that he was given within a tight timeframe.   The cases themselves all seem indivual, but as the story goes on the reader begins to see how they tie together. There's also a lot of suspicions as to who the good guys are in the law enforcement group. Who can Harry trust and who can't he? It's a heck of a good story and one many readers will thourghly enjoy from page to page.   The ending is one that I would never have thought of until revealed in the final twenty pages or so, but again the clues were right there. I suggest if you are looking to read an interesting tale this is the book you want to get a copy of...and enjoy your reading!
B0029LHWFO|5.0|I'm really glad that Barack Obama wrote a book before he entered politics. The story of his life is truly fascinating, and he tells it so well; the book is never dull. I typically avoid books written by politicians because nobody wants to read campaign rhetoric. If you want to hear hollow, ingratiating political rhetoric, all you have to do is turn on CNN or any other 24-hour news network. But Obama is obviously no average politician. I think the biggest reason why he drew so much support in 2008 is because Americans could tell that he actually did have a real personality and his character had not been totally compromised by his desire to be elected. Because of it's authenticity and originality, this book is so much better than his second (campaign) effort [[ASIN:0307455874 The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream (Vintage)]].

1451648537|3.0|If you have no idea who Steve Jobs was, this is probably a decent biography to start with.  If so, read it and ignore the rest of this review.  If you already know the story, have a love of good design and perfectionism, and think that business today is too much about profit, read on.  Isaacson's biography of Jobs is basically in alignment with the standard interpretations of his life that you find across pretty much the entire corpus of the pre-existing Jobs biographies (Journey is the Reward, Next Big Thing, Second Coming, etc.), and so adds little new.  I would have appreciated his at least attempting to look at the problem a little differently, with a little more skepticism about what prior authors had presented.  Instead, Isaacson basically does a dutiful little book report.  In particular, I wish someone would cut through this half-truth about Jobs having been \\"harmful\\" and \\"divisive\\" at Apple, therefore deserving\\" to be fired, to \\"save\\" Apple.  This myth has been perpetuated for years by Markkula, Arthur Rock, Sculley, Gassee, Cringely, etc.  Jobs' failure at NeXT seemed to pretty much confirm that.  But it wasn't accurate.  Fact is, Wozniak's checking out had left him without final authority over the company he'd founded, and, as was completely typical of his personality, Jobs was stepping all over these other people who had taken it over, in an attempt to wrest back that control.  He failed.  But note how those people (like Sculley, Markkula and Gassee) who were so concerned about not being \\"divisive\\" and \\"saving\\" Apple just ended up running it into the ground, all on the back of the same products Jobs had midwifed into being.  What exactly were their wonderful contributions?  But the history was written by the winners, and Isaacson was not courageous enough to revisit this tall tale.  But those of us today, with the benefit of this hindsight, imagine what it would have been like in 1995 and 1996 had Jobs never had to dilute his control of the company earlyon.  Isaacson similarly reiterates hackneyed interpretations about NeXT's history, claiming NeXT failed because Jobs was too perfectionist, too much of a primadonna, and spent scarce money too lavishly on details that others would have regarded as nonessential and wasteful, like brand identity, rearranging factory assembly lines to go from left to right, and having the finish on each pricey magnesium box hand-sanded.  Yet, shortly afterwards, Isaacson tells us that Jobs used those same old famed social engineering skills (like being two-faced and \\"harmful\\" and \\"divisive\\", denouncing people as bozos, etc.'s) to get Amelio, Hancock, Markkula, etc., ousted from control, and proceeded in his second tenure at Apple to be, well, the same old perfectionist and primadonna as he was a NeXT, obsessing over magnetic power adapters, slot-loading drives and brand new factories where computer-controlled water-jets cut computer cases from aluminum blocks!  The only difference-- the only one-- is that NeXT's first product flopped, and the company was broke.  Meanwhile, at Apple, Jobs had both hits and flops (anyone remember the Cube?).  Fact is, NeXT failed because, after the product didn't work out, they had missed a window of opportunity, the market was more mature, and, most of all, they ran out of money.  Jobs couldn't reinvent the company without money, and his reputation was sullied.  When he returned to Apple, though, the company still had such a loyal fan base, even in those dark times, that he just needed to trim the budget, and immediately uncovered fresh capital to launch his renaissance.  Fact is, Jobs did not change.  He was the same man!  It was his situation that changed.  Lastly, and more esoterically, Isaacson belabors the obvious problem with his early abandonment of his daughter, and then validly ties it to his own having been abandoned by his birth parents.  OK, that's been remarked about before.  But what about the fact that Jobs' creation and sole passion inlife, Apple, was separated from him?  What was the existential effect on this man?  Especially given the fact that he was able to regain control of it, might we at least wonder if he'd been plotting his return for some time?  Such great questions these would have been to present the living Jobs with.  How could someone so narcissistic, manipulative and unempathic as Jobs towards peoples' feelings be at the same time so utterly passionate about (and empathic towards?) his company?  Was he not a better father to his company than he was to his kids?  What some people would have given to have had the opportunity to confront Jobs with these questions.  Instead, we will forever be left to wonder.  This book is basically a fumble.
0399245030|5.0|As Mr. K would say, \\"Lost and Found is excellent!\\". Mr. Jeffers has succeeded in writing another book that not only entertains, but doesn't speak down to a large age range of children. Our 3 year old nephew adores Lost and Found. We read it every day and discuss many topics including travel, names, what is loneliness, ducks, geography, birds, umbrellas, etc, etc, etc. This is an exceptional little book!
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The title is Cowboys and Aliens, but it plays like a western where the bad guys just happen to be aliens.  With only one exception, they resisted the use of comic relief, but in that instance, it was done with subtlety.  the casting was great, especially, Clancy Brown, as the preacher.  The photography was great and the sound, excellent.  The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are that there is a scene where the girl comes back to life (in dramatic fashion) that I felt was too contrived and there were a couple of times the movie dragged for a bit.  Oh yes, the aliens were a little over the top and didn't seem the type to make use of the technology they had, but I'm nitpicking a bit.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good movie, that I'll watch many times.
B00540G3G6|3.0|POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)<br /><br />My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />There are about 23 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer but 6 of them are very quick. 2 made it to 15% and 5 more at 25%.<br /><br />The 3D looked somewhat inconsistent from scene to scene and it lacked the crisp details normally associated with animated 3D. This is partly due to originally being a 2D stop-motion film vs. a computer generated animation like most. The lack of colors and the many dark scenes it includes also hampered the 3D.<br /><br />Active Glasses Users: I detected 19 instances of crosstalk but realistically only 5 times the ghosting was easily noticeable. (on my system)<br /><br />MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|My son recently got into Star Trek episodes on You Tube and was devasted when You Tube pulled them and they were no longer available.  So, for his birthday I got him the The Complete Series and was thrilled when it came.  It was boxed very professionally and packed with great care.  Not only does my son love watching the episodes, but my husband and I do too.  You can get this cheaper (a used version), but if you are giving it for a gift, it is worth the money.
0446563048|3.0|Parts of this book were great - honest, experientially learned lessons shared by the author and relevant to anyone trying to build a strong company or understand the roles of happiness and corporate culture in their business. Some of the ideas and practices were valuable and interesting, and Mr. Hsieh clearly shows himself to be well read and to have a wide range of experience under his belt.  Other parts of the book were less impressive. It was annoying to hear the author recount (repeatedly) his boredom when discussing his college years and previous jobs. Moreover, his blunt descriptions of simply not going to classes or to work or finding ways to get other people to do his work for him seriously tarnished the hard-working, good-partner, respect-everyone persona he develops later on. I was also unimpressed by his stories of buying a loft in LA just to hold parties for his friends - complete with fog machines, rave lights, etc.   Mr. Hsieh is a fan of Seth Godin (author of [[ASIN:1591842336 Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us]]) and it shows in his writing and opinions. He is also clearly passionate about his company and his people at Zappos. He intentionally writes the way he speaks and invites readers into his world and along for the ride that took him to the top.   Although I would recommend the work of John Maxwell for anyone looking for leadership guidance, fans of Godin will likely enjoy this book as well.
B003DT194G|3.0|This is far from being my favorite Western movie, dispite some critics who proclaim it to be the greatest ever.  I find Charles Bronson's character silly, his way of blowing the harmonica whenever he shows up just doesn't work for me.  He is just another nameless gunslinger with no depth of character at all.  Henry Fonda is neat as a bad guy, but this part is certainly not his best.  It can't compare to Fonda's role in Warlock.  Throughout the whole film, Jason Robards seems to be wondering why he is there.  Claudia Cardinale's blank expressions in the endless mug shots make her appear stupid.  The land grab premise is weak and is the kind of \\"bad guy stuff\\" of old two reel B Westerns of the 1930's. Action sometimes become unbearably slow, which is somehow supposed to be poetic, but is nothing more than boring.  Even the scenery is poor, transplanting Monument Valley landmarks into a Spanish desert is too much.  Once Upon A Time In The West cannot compare to Leone's The Good The Bad And The Ugly at all.  It certainly does not rank with The Searchers,  The Outlaw Josie Wales, or Monte Walsh.  It's a Western, so I have it in my collection but it's not a great movie.  All that being said, the DVD quality is excellent.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|not that its extremely helpful in finding networks as i find the thing fluctuating so much. however I do find it fascinatingly fun to watch while on the road, watching colorful parabolas appear across the grid. totally ge it,  its not like ur really losing out on anything.

1612130283|5.0|WOW! Different, intense, intriguing, sexy, twisted, emotional, just freaking HAWT, unique, sad, kinky, wonderful and just amazing.  Not a fan of BDSM, the story surrounding this and the characters made this bk for me.  The \\"why\\" that made wealthy, handsome Christian Grey the way he is captured me from the start.  Insatiable curiosity drew me into this story and made it hard to put down. Love a damaged, sexy hero and a woman who can heal him. Ana, naive, heart in her eyes, and unworldly caught up in the largeness that is Christian is drawn into his world. I love that we so carefully see her shock, misgivings, worry, anger, want, wonder, lust and curiosity that lead to her ultimate acquiescence of a relationship with Christian. She`s not without her own wants and needs made known. Wanting what she's not sure Christian is able to give but still asking and surprisingly receiving. These 2 are pulled together in such a powerful way there's definitely reason for Ana to be leery and questioning why Christian's drawn to her. She's so full of self doubt but love how Christian builds her up as in turn she brings out the person he is afraid to be. It's Christian being vulnerable, sweet AND sexy that is the ultimate panty melter for me. Christian and Ana's character development is outstanding.  Knowing that we're being led down a path that may have several twists and turns and that I may or may not like, I was left wanting more and fortunate that there is more in bk 2 - Fifty Shades Darker.

B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Chris Daughtry since his first televised audition on American Idol. At the time I couldn't believe that the British buttmunch didn't care for him; I was blown away, and predicted to my wife that I would buy any record Chris might make in the future. This third album continues in the vein of the first two, with maybe, a little less Nashville sound. Outstanding songwriting, and production, with Chris' very unique voice and great band make for another masterpiece. His style crosses genres, and my wife and daughters, who are into country, like him as much as I do.

B0034G4OVS|3.0|Frozen is not as good as the best reviewers claim, nor is it as bad as the negative reviews suggest. Despite some obvious plot holes that have already been mentioned, I found Frozen to be very enjoyable and exciting. It works best as sort of psychological horror, not a straight-up horror film--it clearly isn't. The lead actress is very good. Engage your imagination, suspend your disbelief and enjoy it.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Adele has good a pretty good voice...but the album itself is over-rated...Her whole album (every single song) is about breaking up with her ex...(how about a little diversity)..that being said, after listening to about 3 songs you start to bored as every single song sounds about the same with the same theme and the same blue feeling to the song.

B004NJDJYS|3.0|I was made to read this book by my book club. I would have never looked twice at this otherwise. The problem for me to rate and review it is because the first 100 - 130 pages were just a chore to get through. Now once Kevin is born and you get into how the family interacted with each other, the book slowly gets much better and by the last 100-200 pages the book was very good and hard to put down. So the last part of the book deserves 5 stars easy. The first part of the book deserves 1 star easy too. So I went in the middle and gave it 3 stars.. Basically this book deals with the aftermath of a son who commmits mass murder at his high school and the mom now dealing with her feelings of guilt.. She is doing this by writing letters to her husband and reliving the last 15 - 20  years of her/their life to see if and where she/they went wrong.. It was very interesting once Kevin is older and she decides to have another child.. That for me, is when the book really starts to take off.. Another drawback for me in the beginning, was that, I needed a dictionary to get through it and get use to this writers style. So overall I would reccomend this book for anyone to read. Well worth the time and effort..

B004H4XLR4|5.0|Having bought tons of Cars toys over the last 4 years, I was thinking at first Sid here was just another die-cast and smaller than my hand... turns out he's more like the Mac toy my son has and is capable of carrying multiple die-cast vehicles.  Despite that knowledge, I did not expect Sid to be so BIG!  It's not a bad thing, just a \\"woah!\\" moment.  If it's anything like the Mac carrier we got from the first movie it will serve for years of great play, but it will eventually have some of the smaller parts break off.  That's the way of lightweight plastic boy's toys, but I'm optimistic it will take a long time for that inevitability to come to fruition.  (:

B0051XI9FO|5.0|My son is beyond obsessed with everything Cars (he sleeps in Lightning McQueen, 'nuf said) and has been collecting everything we'll let him since his 1st birthday.  However, the closest thing he's had to a 'bad guy' has been Chick Hicks up to this point, and he's not exactly bad just kind of a punk.  So, after seeing Cars 2 he was psyched beyond belief that there was a real bad guy available!  Just need to stock up on his Lemon cohorts and we'll be able to reenact the entire film.  Seriously.  I'm not joking.  ;P
B00656C6KK|5.0|Have always been a fan and have most of Doris Day's albums.  Was thrilled to hear that this new CD was coming out and got it a couple of months ago.  She is still the consummate singer and her style is so personal, especially on these songs, that the listener feels as if she is singing to just him/her.  I certainly hope that she will record another album of songs soon!  She still has many old fans and this album should generate a whole new spectrum of fans.  Her voice, diction and style are unbeatable and she is still one of the most wonderful singers of all time.  Shelli Ochsman
B000T5O48U|4.0|i wasnt expecting to like it nearly as much as i did. i settled in for a pulpy good time and instead was treated to something like cormac mcarthy writes jaws with a dog directed by sam peckinpah. its pretty dope. the packaging is ill. and the disk has some good features. -interesting interviews and the like.<br /><br />all around a deal.
B004E5D2M0|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchased. It arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition. The first complete series I had I gave to my daughter for her Birthday after she fell in love with series, as I knew she would. The only problem I have with the uncut version is that I can't really see that much difference in the content. There are a number of freezing up on many of the episodes and sound quality is very poor. I love The Tudors and can't remember enjoying a series as much as this one in a long time so where is the quality when producing the material onto disks. Overall no complaints on the transaction. Amazon is great and I know when I buy from them I'm going to be satisfied with the product. Merry Christmas!!!

B000B7HZXM|5.0|I love the CD of Rod Stewart.  I listen to it both while I play games and when I can't sleep it is relaxing.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|Returned from a trip to Ireland, was always a Corrs fan, so I ordered this CD. It is wonderful, have listened to it over and over and it always takes me back to the beautiful, warm country. Hopefully this family continues to perform together.
B002V0WN2K|5.0|This album grown on you quickly and there are many very strong songs and a few jems.  It's a great album for working out or hiking.  It's uplifting and inspiring and lyrically strong as many of the lyrics can be imagined in your own life.   \\"Love's the only rule\\" is one of my top favorites.. very catchy riff.    This is one of those albums that you listen to all the way through and when it's done you're surprised it's over that quickly.    I hardly write reviews for music albums because there's enough reviewers out there.. but this is such a great album and don't listen to the reviewers who say it's like previous albums.. I have all the albums of the 90's and 2000's and it's defn unique.    It helped me in a very rough time in my life.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I love how this app looks.  It is crisp and clear and easy to read.  Very customizable and responsive.  Highly recommend.
B005URRCNQ|5.0|The vinyl edition of this album is stunning. There is a CD included with the record. The gatefold album cover is made from the thickest cardboard I've ever seen. There is a 16x20 poster of minivans (well I kind of hate this poster and album cover - I really hate minivans), not at all cool or hang up able like the poster from Brothers is.<br /><br />The pressing is immaculate. This is one of the best 180gram pressings I've seen in a long time. Absolutely flawless, not a mar anywhere or indication of low temperature vinyl. For not too much more than the price of the CD, I got the vinyl album, CD, and a poster.<br />Dec. 8, 2011 update: The sleeves are the good kind, a frosted slippery plastic inside, and a rice paper shell (very similar to the Mobile Fidelity Original Masters Record Sleeves). If this is true, Nonesuch has moved to an archival inner sleeve that is really impressive. The album slides in and out of this sleeve easily and does a great job protecting the vinyl. Huge kudos to Nonesuch.<br /><br />The music, I love this album. I'm of the opinion that The Black Keys have worked so hard for the past 10 years, they got a huge success with Brothers, without selling out. This new album is all about influences, the kind of music that Dan and Patrick love. It is an evolution of Brothers - they dig further back in rock and pop history, but always maintaining that fantastic blues edge to their music. The music is truly theirs; it is all about The Black Keys.<br /><br />I will still remember when, my son hearing them in a 500 person club in Chicago and me hearing them last year with about 2,000 other fans. I will remember that when they are playing to sold out arenas this summer. Their music roots are still there, they are still Dan and Patrick from Akron, Ohio even if they live in Nashville now. Granted, I could do with a little less organ in these newer songs, darn you The Greenhornes.<br /><br />In an interview a few years ago, they were emphatic about not being a blues band. They didn't want to be labeled blues because nobody buys blues albums. For a number of years they made some fantastic blues music, just don't tell them that (Chulahoma is absolutely fabulous in a more current take on traditional blues music). The gradually evolved and blended in other influences. Brothers was a great example of just moving that pea a little bit further forward and finding the right mix to become popular. I applaud that move; they made a lot more people aware of our music heritage in the blues and pop music from the 80's.<br /><br />So The Black Keys have accomplished what they set out to do, be a rock band that isn't labeled as a blues band.<br /><br />The influences on this album are all over the map, from Led Zeppelin and 70's French pop music to the blues. It's an interesting trip Dan and Patrick have taken us down.<br /><br />1) Lonely Boy - This is the most insidious song on the album. The video of the one guy dancing in front of a flea bag hotel is just too amazing. This was the first song promoted from the album, available in MP3 download a number of weeks ago. It's a good song, nice hook, and will probably get a fair amount of radio play.<br /><br />2) Dead And Gone - I can't believe that they channeled 70's French pop music on this song. This is a pleasant song.<br /><br />3) Gold On The Ceiling - Foghat and David Bowie, 80's pop / rock with a funky organ playing.<br /><br />4) Little Black Submarines - Led Zeppelin, a spin on Stairway to Heaven meeting the blues. The song starts out acoustic, there's a slight echo in Dan's voice, as if the recording were done more in a club than a studio. I liked the roughness of the recording of his vocals. Then the song moves on to some good solid hard rocking. It doesn't shriek like Stairway to Heaven, it just drives forward with good solid hard driving music. The song doesn't wind back down to acoustic, it fades away.<br /><br />5) Money Maker - OK, you hard core Black Keys / blues fans, this is the song for you. I like this song a lot; it shows off what Dan and Patrick do best.<br /><br />6) Run Right Back - 70's psychedelic rock. There's a really nice hook in this song. Easy to sing after listening to this track.<br /><br />7) Sister - 80's pop and blues. Oddly, there was a little bit of Grazing in the Grass by The Friends of Distinction from the late 60's in here.<br /><br />8) Hell Of A Season - Really good song. Can't place the influence exactly. There was another odd little bit of The Brothers Johnson in the background music.<br /><br />9) Stop Stop - the pinnacle of rock influence. This is a driving song, one to listen to while driving in the car. Steppenwolf and Golden Earring, the song moves fast.<br /><br />10) Nova Baby - the worst song on the album. Worst of the 90's pop junk. Like a bad Tears For Fears song. This is so overproduced and way too glossy. I really hated this song.<br /><br />11) Mind Eraser - An OK song that is somewhat over produced. I really prefer a rougher edge, more of just Dan and Patrick.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good album. It's impossible to tell if it will be anywhere as popular as Brothers. I wish The Black Keys well. They have paid their dues and worked really hard to get where they are today. This is an evolution of their previous work - it fits very nicely in their catalog.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003F5WOEC Brothers (2 LP w/Bonus CD)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000NJXC4E Chulahoma [Vinyl]]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002WYY The Best Of Friends Of Distinction]]<br />[[ASIN:B001LQSFKY Mobile Fidelity: Original Master Inner Record Sleeves (50 Units)]]is is the song for you.

B000F8O35U|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and She Loves it. i was worried about scratches or the dvd not working but it works great like new. still watching this movie.
B004X80QNG|4.0|synced with my Google calendar just fine all by itself.  Needs a widget.. without one I don't really understand why no move to sd option.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|I am a huge Prince fan, and have all of his albums, I have this cd as well, however it's more to have a complete collection than anything else. there are no new songs on this hits package, but it's a decent representation of his work. This isn't for anyone who is a more serious fan of his music. This is more geared to those who loved the radio/singles hits. For a better compilation (if you are the type who enjoys listening to whole albums and not just singles) I'd recommend Ultimate Prince. As it has remastered versions of most songs on this compilation but with the added bonus of a second disc, full of extended versions and B-Sides. With Prince, many times the 12\\" singles were an experience unto themselves. One got the idea that the ext. versions were probably the original versions, but they had to be truncated on the album to save space. For instance the added music on Raspberry Beret as well as him clearing his throat (which sounds weird as I type it, but when you hear it you realise how well this works for the song)plus you have an added song not found anywhere else. Another example would be Kiss, which possesses additional lyrics/music. or you can buy the Hits, the B-sides Though on that release some of the B-sides are the shorter versions, either way it's nice to have as many of those singles were never rereleased in cd formant, only vinyl. One small gripe with all ot the best of compilations, some songs, such as When Doves Cry are the edited versions. When Doves Cry was a #1 hit for  quite a few weeks. Where I live they tend to play the full version of the song, editing it for a single release or to save space just doesn't give the song enough room to breathe. Much like Bohemian Rhapsody was back in the day When Doves cry deserves to be played in full. Fortunately the song Purple Rain, is basically played in its entirety. So the bottom line is this album is either for the more casual fan (those who liked what they heard on the radio) but isn't really for die-hard fans (but it is a good starting point cd, meaning this would be great to buy for a friend in order to introduce them to Prince) Like I said I have it more because I am a completist I do like the pictures etc in the booklet, it is well put together.It just doesn't have enough of what most people want from a Prince Greatest Hits CD. I would also reccomend to anyone who wants to know where to start when they are looking to get into his music, Sign O' the Times, Purple Rain, 1999 and Emancipation (a three disc set, which sells at a very reasonable price...if not outrageously cheep for a three cd set..This showcases the 90s sounds/themes the best. While this is a great compilation I would reccomend people to buy this only if you are a completist, or want a good place to start. This is great for the more casual listener who prefers the top 10 songs. Also, as a side note (not sure if this would matter in your eyes) Prince has stated that he does not support this compilation, he simply did not endorse it and in his defense, it does look more like a money grab by WB rather than a concise playlist of his best work. Besides they already released the hits/b-sides and most prince fans would rather have all the bonuses/bells and whistles. Sony released an MJ and Billy Joel ultimate collection, that showcased demos, rare songs (such as soundtrack songs that aren't on any other album by the artists) as well as alternate takes and a dvd. I don't understand why WB doesn't do a more comprehensive set like both of those. Prince's B-Sides and Extended Versions could fill up a box set easily just by itself. But this cd is what it is. And on the basis of the music/song selection...I'll give it five stars.
1451627289|4.0|Once again, Stephen King has written a book that alternately moves you and thrills you.  As usual, the best parts of are in the journey, not the payoff. King's \\"sideline episodes\\" are insightful and touching, often more than the main narrative.  As he did in \\"Bag of Bones\\", he details haunting scenes love and loss and the struggles of his characters to control their own fates, in addition to that of others.  Finally, he offers a vision of what might have been, and how \\"what might have been\\" doesn't always turn out as one might think.   Add a fifth star if you are a fan....this is one of his best.
B000000HZT|4.0|I haven't listened to this in years but remember liking it, thought I'd review it while it was playing. I do remember that the vocals weren't very good or at least not the kind I prefer. No Phil or Peter here.  \\"From The Undertow\\": Nice instrumental typical of Tony and a great way to start the album. 4 stars  \\"Lucky Me\\": Starts like a Genesis song and then the vocals start, Kim Beacon is the singer and not my style. He reminds me of Paul Carrack and this song is a little like Tony and the Mechanics, if you will. 3 stars  \\"The Lie\\": The piano at the beginning is beautiful and leads into a nice back beat and some mediocre vocals. Kim isn't an awful singer just not my style and his blues vocals don't seem to fit the music. Guess it did to Tony though. Makes it sound a little like progressive bubble gum. The music saves it though and all in all 4 stars.  \\"After The Lie\\": Now were cooking with gas, this is a 5 star number and the vocals are way better than in the last two numbers. Chester Thompson shows up on this one with some nice drumming.   \\"A Curious Feeling\\": Back to Tony and the Mechanics on this one. 3 stars  \\"Forever Morning\\": A welcome break from the vocals with some excellent keyboard work by one of the best. 5 stars.  \\"You\\": Would start side two of the cassette I originally had this on. A not real bad and not real good ballad. The end of the song is great however, making it 4 stars. You can hear the sound that would come out on \\"Duke.\\"  \\"Somebody Else's Dream\\": Another 5 star number, vocals are the best on the album and the music builds to a nice ending.    \\"The Waitress of Lethe\\": Just Tony and some of the best keyboard work I have ever heard. Just a beautiful song and I give it 6 stars. Great, Great tune. Good Job Tony!!  \\"For A While\\": Just a regular pop ballad. Could have been on \\"And Then There Were Three\\" and would have been better with Phil singing it. 3 stars  \\"In The Dark\\": Keyboard and vocal: Guess which one I like better? 4 stars.   Summary: Good CD with some great keyboard work and good drums by Chester. The vocals, to me at least, just don't fit the music. His voice is more suited to blues or pop rock. Not for progressive, keyboard dominated music. That's for Jon Anderson or Phil or Peter. Whatever not Kim Beacon. I have bought this 3 times so I must like it and I do. A light 4 stars due to mediocre vocals. If you are a fan of Mike and the Mechanics, you will like this.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I saw this movie a few years ago and I fell in love with it, so I finally decided to buy it, and of course I had to come to my favorite place to buy good movies at a reasonable price...

0307959856|4.0|I suspect J.D. James had a good time writing 'Death Comes to Pemberley'.  She is respectful of Austen (see if you can find her references to other Austen novels), familiar characters are recognizable (Lydia still irritates), and the fun is in the details of a well-crafted mystery.  If you are either a total Janeite or a total fan of James' mysteries, then  you may be greatly disappointed.  However, for those who enjoy a playfulness by a best-selling writer, you may have a lot of fun reading what I found to   be a compelling novel.
B005AUWY2W|4.0|My wife and I are retired, but enjoy watching animated movies.  This was a good one with lots of laughs.  Yes, I agree with some of the other reviews that there was more reference to death than really needed to be.  I think the plot could have been just as rich without killing cars on the screen.  This is a whole different adventure than the original, and doesn't expand the characters as well as the first one.  It was, however fast moving and entertaining.
0316287059|3.0|Irritatingly, there was a page on how to get the Elizabeth Taylor makeup look, but instead of a single picture of Taylor, there was a picture of Wynona Rider dressed as her. This happened repeatedly in the book. On the how to get the Bette Davis look page, Davis wasn't pictured, but Susan Sarandon was, dressed as Betti Davis. Confused? I was. As for the other how to's, one is of how to literally face paint a blue flower over one eye to look like Twiggy, so that's going to be useful. Equally useful, is the how to look like Elizabeth the I of England, with no eyebrows. Or how to look like a Native American, by wearing tons of bronzer, and pay \\"tribute\\" to their \\"proud heritage\\". You can even learn how to make yourself look like James Dean, because Gwyneth Paltrow did for a drag photoshoot. I have no use for this book. Maybe if the real women who inspired their signature looks were actually pictured, then I would rate this higher. You have to be really into todays stars to love this book.

B005URRCUY|5.0|This album ROCKS(period)!! That said, while \\"Brothers\\" was a bit overstuffed with slow-burning soul songs, this \\"El Camino\\" is a fuel injected, revved up, pedal-to-the-metal, tire squeeling lean and mean rock feast! In fact, I think this album is best to listen to while driving because you will find it impossible to avoid slapping your thumbs to the drums on your steering wheel, kick drumming your feet and pounding your console! Now THAT is the sign of a great rock album!  Sure it may take 2-3 listens to break it in like a new pair of skinny jeans, but ignore all that hipster holier-than-thou sellout crap, kick back and just enjoy the ride. This album is their quick victory lap for making it on their own terms after years of hard work and great songs. I fell in love with Rubber Factory and the earlier stuff too, but personally I think this album is more true to their earlier spirit than the last couple of albums. Because what always struck me about those early albums was how they managed to play the same hard blues based songs one after another and I wouldn't get tired of it...ballad's?? Who needs 'em?! Acoustic guitar/bass?? Why bother?! Over the course of those albums they flat-out perfected that sound, and you can't build on perfection. Thus we got the experimentation of Attack & Release and Brothers. I immediately LOVED about half of Brothers (the rockin' half) and the other half I grew to enjoy over time. Regardless, I still best like my Black Keys playing full on rock all the way through. And that's what you get with El Camino.    The first five songs are nearly flawless with the highlight being \\"Little Black Submarines\\" which ironically starts out acoustic before erupting into a total guitar drum meltdown that should make Jimmy Page piss his pants. I think it's easily their best song since the Rubber Factory days and should forever be a highlight of their live show. The last half of the album took a little extra listening before I truly loved it, but it didn't take long. Again, like many of you, I love that purist early sound too and can't help but to furrow my brow a little when I hear a bass guitar or organ part. However, these songs are so tight and infectious that you'll get over that pretty quick. Just lean back and let Dan and Pat do the driving and you'll have a blast listening to this album. Finally, I seriously can't believe some people don't get the El Camino title with a minivan on the cover!! First of all, it's really more a subjective reference to their early days on \\"the road\\" in a van. Secondly, it's classic Black Keys humor! I couldn't help but laugh when I first saw the cover!
B004T5K3OK|4.0|It's very productive and useful. I use it to take pictures of my homework and the professors notes when I can't have physical handouts
1451627289|5.0|This is a fun time travel book. For those that like Time Travel this will be a fun ride. I liked it and you will too.  I think older readers will enjoy this book more so than younger ones. The sense of nostalgia is excellent.  Parts of the book drag and could have been edited out. Also there is a lot or repetition of ideas and stuff that  make the book tedious and not lend to a sense of impending doom or destiny. Wandering through Dallas and so on  was as dull as it gets. And I think silly. In reality, George as told in the story, would have easily knocked  off Oswald and moved on. That Dallas section is very dull.  The good: the book is time travel story. In that respect it rocks. And it is a love story.  Life is a bitter sweet journey and loss and acceptance of that loss is part of it. This book has a lot  of that bitter sweet feeling.  The best part of the book is George teaching school in Texas, the play and his first weeks in the love  affair with Sadie. The book was worth that section alone. It seemed totally real and in many ways  was the peak of the book and of course, George's/Jakes happiness? After this..well..you have to read the book.  Flawed, because of the slow parts, but overall, a great read. A little editing, lose that Dallas section, and other  ovely long winded parts (Darby!) and it would be a better book. Like Melville in Moby Dick, King goes down some  roads in the book, sometimes for pages, that don't do anything for the story.

1423140591|4.0|Riordan just keeps getting better and better for me. I couldn't wait for this book because I got to see how Percy was doing in this new adventure with the new set of characters. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Riordan brought the original Percy legacy into the mixture and combined it beautifully with a new one.<br /><br />Riordan's characters and their individual tweaks are some of my favorite of all time. The newbies on this end of the new series are my picks so far. The new members we were introduced to in The Lost Hero were interesting and made good additions to the Percy family, but I found I could relate more to these. I think my favorite part of the book was the backgrounds of the new characters, especially Hazel. The twists and turns in her life turned out to have a greater impact than what I originally thought. Frank, I adore him. His back story is so rich and it makes him a wonderful character to follow. Sometimes I did have problems keeping up with who is who on the Gods side because of the alternate names, but it wasn't that bad, just different. It wouldn't be an issue for most people, but I've never delved deeply in the histories of the Greeks or Romans.<br /><br />The plot is as enjoyable as the first book, but there were a few pitfalls for me. It flows at a good pace, but there are spots I wanted it to speed up to fit the scene. It felt anti-climatic like this in quite a few areas. The perspectives that the characters' back stories gave on the plot really good twists and turns. However, Percy's amnesia is a sinker for me. It wasn't as bad for me in The Lost Hero, but this storyline with it aggravated me at times. I think this may be a \\"just me\\" issue, because amnesia stories sometimes have that affect on me. I'm sure it was not a problem for others. I love the way this book and the first book of the series connect in plots. It will make the third book in the series, The Mark of Athena, very interesting in plot aspects. I can't wait to see how the characters will interact with each other and the world that they are in now...interact with each other and the world that they are in now...

B004YTGRMI|5.0|Very nice. I have been an REM fan from the beginning and now, sadly, at the end of their career. They produced so many strong albums and I'm sure we all have our favorites. This one was sort of pivotal, between the early, guitar jangle folk-rock sound of the previous albums and foreshadowing their more guitar-crunch, electric efforts such as Document (a favorite) and Monster. It was also one of their most accessible albums with the hit 'Fall On Me' - it was a very optimistic record in my opinion. The boxed set packaging is nice to have with images from the vinyl cover repeated plus the posters and cards. Although I have all the released REM LPs on vinyl, cassette and CD - I will collect these box sets as they are available (Murmur, Reckoning, Fables ...). Great!

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Witty dialogue mixes with attractive people giving solid performances. Of course u know what's going to happen at the end but remarkably, this intelligently written film makes the entire journey worthwhile enough to buy the DVD. Great look at my old hometown NYC. Timberlake continues to convince he's a serious actor, Kunis is always delightful and the viewer gets an eyeful of Mila's body-double with a small and shapely behind.<br /><br />I thought the inclusion of Timberlake's character's father as suffering form the onset of Alzeimers laudable, and Justin doesn't overplay the part emotionally, which was a relief in a Hollywood thats normally eager to let sobs and tears act as the panacea for dealing with all life's emotional issues.<br />I felt Woody Harrelson's character - not his acting - was annoying in that it's becoming so de rigeur for Hollywood to pat-on-the-back every man obsessed with other men's genitals. This MUST BE APPLAUDED BY US ALL, or you are a primitive, horrible person (whose name will soon be on some government list, no doubt) with no understanding of our human diversity. Harrelson's character dutifully fulfills his self-acceptance as a gay man obsessed with the male penis, by continuing to let everyone know he is not ashamed of it, as we - the audience - are culturally trained to accept and applaud.
B005IZLPME|4.0|It is a Fun movie. The 3d visuals were good I can not wait for the next sequel to come out next year.
B005HMHPGI|5.0|I am very pleased with my dvd It's A Wonderful Life.  I especially like the bell ornament and the booklet is interesting.
B004G600A4|5.0|I was very skeptical about Tangled when my wife dragged me to see it in the theater. I've never been a huge Disney fan, and it seemed like your standard Disney fair. Imagine my surprised when I couldn't help laughing out loud in the theater, and eagerly pre-ordered it as soon as I could. The characters are all great, and Rapunzel in particular is a role model young girls can actually look up to. The songs are by and large very good, and the animation is beautiful. There is no reason not to give this movie a shot, I heartily recommend it for people of all ages.
B0002IU988|5.0|Downloaded this album many moons ago, finally bought it to support one of the best rock bands around today. I highly recommend all 4 of their albums (including AB 3.5)!!

B0055S348W|1.0|Glad I did not pay 12.95 for it.  It prints all the text I send to the printer VERY tiny and has apparently no options to make any changes......  This program was/is a big disappointment to me. Have been sending the files to my win 7 computer and printing from there.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|worst cd ever.  Enough said.  I guess I have to use more words.  Sorry I took the time to listen to it
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app for many reasons. but mainly use it to help predict the weather in three different States I visit each week.  It is an awesome tool.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie was a very good movie to watch with the family. It is adventurous and hilarious. The kids will love it. This movie is about a bird who has went missing when he went to Rio with his owner. The bird met up with a female bird that was lasts of its kind. They were meant to breed to expand the population and so their species won't go extinct. These two birds had a big adventure to go on after they try to return back to their owners.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Overall great album. A variety of tracks from rap to a bit r&b. A wonderful sophomore effort and you can tell there is a better consistency than Thank Me Later. My favorite track is probably \\"Doing it Wrong\\" where Drake sings over a lush Noah \\"40\\" Shebib beat.
B005NFJAMG|4.0|This movie starts out strange. Steven Segal is in the movie, then is killed off early. Then Russell & his team start up and the movie catches fire. Great action sequences.
B004X80QNG|4.0|Lack of Google sync- Ya sucks This app only has this one drawback. It makes up for one shortcoming 10-fold in every other aspect. Wonderful app. For the person on the go, this suits us perfect.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Not releasing the TRUE originals on blue ray is a slap to the face of die hard fans that waited so long.  I do not care if the revised versions are out there, but give us the option to see the movies we grew up with too.
0446560065|3.0|This book is cute enough. It's a very short read, I \\"read\\" it in under half an hour. I found some of the drawings repetitive and some very funny. I guess I just see more of my own cats in the youtube videos than in this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have had no problems with this app.  It is easy to use and understand.  I find it to be very useful.
B006G2124E|5.0|This was a fantastic movie! Bringing to light the minority perspective of people in Mississippi in the 1960s. A great movie about courage, friendship, injustice and love.
B005V1WVPA|5.0|I won't take the time to break down all the songs like some do, just do yourself a favor and buy the album. I opted for the mp3 version the second it came to Amazon and I have no regrets on buying this item. Keep an open mind and I am sure you will appreciate all that is and ever will be Korn.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It took a little bit of time to get used to this app, but I am very happy with it. I've had no problems with it.
0880793082|5.0|This is a great way to go if you actually use the thoth deck, as they fit your hands quite well.  It helps to have the larger deck, or even full prints of the images of the cards if you are into that sort of thing, but for practical use, this is the way I go.  The larger deck does work well, don't get me wrong, I just find it a bit clumsy at times, and this smaller deck works perfectly for me.

Especialmene para um homem do s&eacute;culo vinte um.<br /><br />Thibault &eacute; um homem obstinado com um prop&oacute;sito. &Eacute; dif&iacute;cil conhecermos pessoas assim, pois são raras. Sendo um fuzileiro naval, ele tem consciência de disciplina e a aplica em sua rotina. Ele busca pela mulher em uma foto que encontrou no Iraque. Um talismã que ele aprende a reconhecer como um elemento de sorte.<br /><br />Beth &eacute; uma mulher que possui a independência t&iacute;pica de mães divorciadas.

Talvez ela seja um pouco passiva demais e a entrada de Thibault em sua vida certamente transforma as coisas ao seu redor, tirando-a de sua zona de conforto. Intercalando as perspectivas da narrativa, o leitor tem a oportunidade de conhecer as personagens de forma mais &iacute;ntima, incluindo o pseudo vilão da est&oacute;ria. Clayton, o obcecado ex marido de Beth.<br /><br />Apesar do enredo centralizado no romance entre Thibault e Beth, \\"Um Homem de Sorte\\" &eacute; tamb&eacute;m um livro que não poupa os leitores de detalhes crueis  sobre a guerra. Assim como a obra anterior do autor \\"Querido John\\", o protagonista &eacute; um homem que conheceu o lado mais negativo dos seres humanos e as mis&eacute;rias causadas pela guerra. Por&eacute;m,Thibault &eacute; o personagem mais intenso que o autor j&aacute; escreveu,existe um aspecto subjetivo sobre sua personalidade, atraente e que envolve os leitores. Eu diria que &eacute; um protagonista de voz poderosa,e que fala diretamente com o coração do leitor.<br /><br />Se você &eacute; uma pessoa que admira os pequenos detalhes da vida, e sabe que são eles os formadores da felicidade, vai gostar deste novo lançamento de Nicholas Sparks. Ningu&eacute;m sabe melhor que ele como discorrer sobre sofrimento e amor,e escrever para emocionar milhares de leitores pelo mundo.<br /><br />Uma est&oacute;ria sobre pessoas, suas falhas e acertos.

B0044XV3QY|1.0|If you got to this movie by going to the search box at the top of your screen and put in 3D movies, please know that it is NOT 3D.  I did a search and bought this movie because it was under the 3D movies.  I now have to return it because it is not.  I also called customer service a few days ago and it looks like they did not change this and probably wont.  Very disappointed!

B004X80QNG|5.0|PI Syncs Google calendar BY DEFAULT (its in Calendar Visibility) . I mean, I does anybody who reviews this app even look at the program? Configurable just about any way you can think, and can be viewed however you wish. Very nice. Now if I could get PrinterShare to format my calendar as nice as PI...
1594744769|5.0|This book was interesting, easy to read and different! Couldnt wait to see what happened next and to get back to where i left off. I sure hope there is a second book because it leaves you wanting to know what happens next at the end. I definately recommend if looking for something imaginative and out of the ordinary! looking forward to more from this author and what happens to the kids!

B0061JPYX2|2.0|I LOVE Amy Winehouse, but this is not an album it is  a bunch of songs they put together.  You can find all of them somewhere else and didn't seem like good recordings either.
1451627289|3.0|Even though the book has 800+ pages, it is a easy and entertaining read.  On the plus side, There is the \\"required\\" love story which takes up about half of the story.  Also, it is a nice trip down memory lane comparing life in the late 1950's and 1960's to the present.  On the negative side, I would be concerned that even though the book is fiction, people might confuse the author's fictional manipulations of history with the reality of what occurred.  King is a great story teller and has woven together a fun, fictional story of time travel and Lee Harvey Oswald's life. Although it will never be a classic, it should be a good \\"beach read\\".
B002I0J5FG|5.0|These games are amazing and should be experienced by anyone remotely interested   in beautiful sounding/looking video games. You will definitely see an improvement  in the frame rate of Shadow of the Collossus, which was one of the few annoyances   I had in it. Ico is still as atmospheric as ever especially with the sharper textures. Overall this HD collection is a great value even though the games are  a little old,which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
1400032717|5.0|Brilliant, just truly brilliant. A loving, sly novel with an early teenaged narrator who is autistic. If you've ever wanted to be inside an autistic mind, this may be your ticket. And if you just love great writing, this is definitely your ticket.
1423140591|5.0|The book arrived on time and it was great.  It was well received and read quickly.  Thank you for the quick response and I would buy again from Amazon.
1439170916|5.0|This is a page-turner. About the history, sociology, treatment and impact of cancer. If that sounds impossible to do, read the book. If it sounds interesting, read the book. I haven't read a more profound, well-researched or engaging non-fiction work in ages.   I'll leave it to other reviewers to give you more details, but I cannot recommend this one strongly enough. You'll be more empathetic and far better informed on the ongoing war on cancer.
B006C45MRE|4.0|Great cast...Harrison Ford, that new James Bond guy....13 from House, David Carradine's brother, ect ect.<br />  One thing I cant get over is this Alien, they make him look all big and ugly, just a wild beast with the brains of a Tiger....yet I am to somehow believe that this Intelligent Extra Terrestrial (who has the brains of a beast mind you) Built this space ship they were flying around??  Come on! Such an advanced lifeform , builds a ship and flies across the galaxy and just blows up stuff and ropes men and women, so stupid!
0307279189|5.0|This is one of the best nonfiction books I've read this year.   Starting with the basics: McDougall's book begins as an exploration into running injuries, but is really about three interweaving themes: Ultramarathon running; the Tarahumara people; and barefoot running.   I was most impressed by *how* McDougall tells these three stories. They're all interconnected, and I had the sense that the book works like waves crashing onto the beach - each wave overlaps the ones that had come before, mixing and making the previous wave reverberate. It's a truly impressive writing job.   And it's a fascinating story, and inspiring, and very entertaining.
0977326403|5.0|Jim Collins has created a truly outstanding, and easy to read and follow, short monograph designed to help those of us who manage not for profit organizations achieve greatness. I purchased copies for my entire Board.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have been waiting for something like this since the last movie came out.  The quality of the case was good. So far all of the movies have worked. Overall great product.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I haven't had any problems with it on my Fire. I have 3 locations stored and can switch between them easily.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|I have been a long time fan of the Beatles and Sir Paul is my favorite bassist hands down. With that said this remastered CD is great. Very clean sound while retaining all its warmth and sound as on the LP. You can hear subtle sounds such as a breath drawn before a verse or fingers moving on the fret board of a guitar. As with any CD no snap, crackle, pop as with vinryl that has been played more than five times.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It works as stated. I didn't have any problems installing the application; not sure why some were having problems. i am satisfied and enjoying the apps.
B006C45CFG|4.0|This got panned in the theaters, but unjustly. Its well made, paced, well acted and it takes itself very seriously which is why it works. No campy, wink-wink tone here. It is kind of an odd mash-up of genres and the Western part works better than the sci-fi, but overall solid entertainment. Craig, Ford, and Wilde are good along with A-list supporting cast.
1402720602|5.0|Excellent book!!  An exceptional book that takes you through all the steps of building a classical guitar! The experience the author has is clearly displayed not only in his writings but also in the great photographs of his work. John Bogdanovich studied at the College of the Redwoods under James Kernove, one of the world's finest cabinet makers and craftsman and John's passion and skill are evident on every page. Of the 4 different books I bought on building a guitar this is by far the best and most understandable at all levels.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game is great! its just like spider solitaire. its fun and enjoyable for everyone. I would recommend this game for anyone trying to pass by time.
B0041T52S6|4.0|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may not be the most interesting film storyline-wise, truth be told, but it's certainly the most fascinating to watch.    Basically it takes a simple love story between Michael Cera's character and a crush he develops on this, how shall we say, solid, emotionless girl who dies her hair different colors, but... the problem is that he's already dating a cute Asian girl, so what does Michael do?   He falls in love with both, of course!  Of course he's actually more interested in the hair-dying girl because it was love at first sight the moment he spotted her.  Interestingly, the girl doesn't just dismiss him immediately- they develop a relationship of sorts.  Perhaps not how you'd think.  Sort of like a little more than a friendship but not quite boyfriend/girlfriend.  Michael's in a rock band, and his dream is to one day become a famous, legitimate band.  Throughout the film his band performs for large audiences.  However, NEITHER of these two storylines are actually the focus here.  No siree!  What's *actually* the focus is the highly unusual Matrix-like fighting segments that take place on screen between Michael Cera's character and his enemies.  In other words, every so often Michael will suddenly find myself face to face in an intense battle with these mysterious, highly advanced foes.  Why?  I have no earthly idea, haha.    Alright, there IS actually a reason why.  He's obsessed with this one tournament fighter at the arcade, and he's determined to break the highest scores.  In order to do this... he has to fight his real-life enemies Matrix-style.  It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before in an action/adventure, which makes me think the words \\"science fiction\\" should be thrown in the description somewhere.  Also, pertaining to these fights, they interact with Michael's real-life problems involving his girlfriends so he finds himself battling them for the sake of integrity I guess?  It should be noted that, despite some major butt kickings he receives, he's never seriously injured since this *is* an adventure type movie after all.    It should also be noted that I wasn't expecting this film to be so nerdy and childish, but the fact it's so different from anything I've ever seen before gives it a serious boost in my ratings scale.  Otherwise it's just another teenage romance comedy that's not particularly funny.  I like all the references and sound effects that came from the old Super Nintendo classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.  That's one of the best Zelda games of all-time for those who've never played it, and surely considered a classic on nearly every single video game list that centers around the \\"best games of all time\\".  Also worth noting is the reference to the old rock/glam band from the 70's T.Rex and their hit song \\"Teenage Dream\\".  I was truly shocked to hear this song in one segment.  Overall, intended for Matrix fans and teenagers.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Lots of action, interesting plot, actors did well, special effects were good.  Only wish it had been a little longer for more character and the \\"Viking\\" era of the environment to be more fully developed.
B004X80QNG|4.0|I read all the reviews where it will not sync with outlook.  Maybe it depends on the android version you are running, but on mine, I have my phone (Desire ROM) set to sync with my work email and calender using the Exchange ActiveSync and my corporate calender shows up in this program.  If you are trying to sync with a cable to your Outlook at home, then I cant help you there, but for those trying to sync with your corporate account, it works for me.  Note that Android is set to sync, not the program.  The program pulls in everything that the phone is set up to retrieve.<br /><br />It doesnt appear to sync tasks, but even other highly acclaimed apps such as GTasks ($5) or Google Tasks Organizer ($3) can't do it either and they dont have a calender. I think its a Google thing, not a developer thing.  All I've seen that can sync Outlook and Google is gSyncit, which is a $20 stand alone program.<br /><br />There should probably be a widget too.  Maybe in the next update?
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I really like this game because it has a lot of quick finger moving. also it has really good graphics.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I believe this is my favorite of all the Fast & Furious Movies.  A lot of action and of coarse humor with some drama.  It's definately a movie you can watch over and over again!  It's a must have for the Fast & Furious Fan!

B00000G3PA|4.0|There have been presented very clever ways to address the scientific incongruity in the film by supporters, and lists of fallacies by those driven crazy by them. I think it all boils down to just letting all that go, however. The science of the film cannot be supported. In fact it's quite absent. I shook my head and just giggled at silly inaccuracy after silly inaccuracy, but I was enjoying the film too much to care. The characters are familiar. They've all been seen before, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy them again with the right framing and casting. This is not a classic movie for the same reason Citizen Kane is a classic. It does not hold any appeal as a work of art. This film is valuable purely as entertainment for entertainment's sake. A viewer can either enjoy it as such, or they should move on and find another movie. There are plenty of art films out there to tickle our intellect. This movie tickles the adrenal gland and sense of humor. That is what the filmmakers set out to do, and they succeeded admirably.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Having never listened to Michael Buble' before I was truly curious about this man.  His style is quite creative and innovative! I definitely enjoy this presentation and look forward to listening to many more of his recordings!
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Unlike the 1994 boxset, which was short and kinda sucked, this set manages to include everything from that previous set and also, for the first time ever, includes a little bit from every band/artist to perform at Woodstock (minus a few who chose not to participate in this release, such as The Band and Ten Years After).  Each is represented by no less then 2 songs each and even more for the well known artists.  What's awesome is all the hilarious between song chatter and stage announcements.  It's nowhere near the complete 3 days of the festival but, it's so much content that you feel like you're actually there.  If you were to listen to it in a single sitting, the set runs approximately 8 hours long.  The sound quality is superior to any Woodstock recordings I've ever heard before.  Keep your 1994 boxset for the few non-inclusions to this set, but definitely check this out.  It's well worth the price!!!  While you're at it, get the 1970 concert film on Bluray.  It is stunning in both picture and sound!  If you have the DVD, seriously... Upgrade! Upgrade! Upgrade!

B001O7Y9ZU|5.0|A long time ago, my dad had a few Phil Collins and Genesis cassettes that he played religiously in the car whenever my family used to take road trips.  I would always ask him to play \\"...But Seriously.\\"  Because of my dad, I ended up taking a liking to his music and in my later years, purchased most of his albums on CD.  He is one of the greatest drummers/vocalists in the history of music.  This is the nearly flawless 1989 album packed with all the hits:  \\"Do You Remember\\", \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\", \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\", \\"Another Day In Paradise\\", etc.  The production is top notch and features guests such as: Eric Clapton on guitar and Steve Winwood on keyboards, among others.  Unfortunately, while Phil put out some decent stuff in the 1990's, this would end up being his last truly classic album.  Pick this up if you don't already have it.  5 stars!!!
B004X80QNG|1.0|I downloaded this app as the free app of the day.  Although it is offered for the Kindle Fire, I had the same experience as other users that it crashes on start up and needs a force quit.  Will be glad to try again when functional on this platform.

B004UXUX4Q|1.0|Sorry, cannot say I enjoyed this film. The good part is the acting and scenary, but the story is long and drawn out, and the plot is just silly.  A wife lies in a coma, the daughter is at private rehab and of course turns from rebellious to compliant within 1 day.  Her friend is quirky and doesn't work in the story.  The father in law only shows his soft side behind closed doors (of course). The \\"other man\\" is tracked down so he can say goodbye (huh?).  I don't know if they didn't miss the mark by simply concentrating on the immediate family dynamic and dropping the unncessary side stories including the best friends, the land trust (except Beau Bridges is part of that story and gotta love him), and the other man's family.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|I played piano as a child and I always liked the instrument...but after discovering Ludovico Einaudi about two years ago, I listen to pianists all the time now.

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I remember when Metallica first came out in the early 80's. They were so different from everything going on at that time. That whole thrash scene was all about pushing boundries in a very exciting and experimental way. Metallica's music had a profound impact on just about all the hard music to follow it. It is really hard to overestimate the importance of the impact that Metallica has had upon rock music and even music in general. I am sure that there are countless musicians out there who don't have the slightest clue about the influence Metallica has had upon them either directly or indirectly because they are so big that they are just taken for granted as being ingrained upon the subliminal mind of our culture.   Lou Reed has just as much if not more impact upon music as Metallica, but will never get the credit he deserves. He is the seminal architect of proto-punk. Anyone who has ever appreciated punk, grunge, thrash, or any other music influenced by punk owes him a debt of gratitude. While the music of Metallica is certainly more commercial, both acts have built their initial reputations upon nonconformity.  Thrash was exciting at the time because it pushed the boundries. It took chances and wasn't afraid to break the rules. Now everyone expects its musicians to conform in an ironic manner back to the very same attributes which were at one time considered to be rebellious. But what are you going to do? There is no way to convince the philistine horde of the value of a work of art. All you can do is become the lone voice of wisdom.  For the record, I am not a big fan of what Metalica has become, and haven't followed Reed's work since the Velvet Undergroud. That being said, both acts are giants who have altered the very landscape of music. I tip my hat to both acts for coming together for Lulu. This is the most relevant thing Metallica has done since Master of Puppets. Finally there is something intersting going on in music again and everyone takes a dump on it. Let's all jump on the 1980's minivan bandwagon and punish nonconformist collaboration and experimenting with music. I just hope Metallica sticks to their guns on this one and keeps experimenting. I imagine they die a little inside every time they have to play the same songs over and over again. MOP must be like Smoke on the Water to them by now. Seriously people, get a grip. Are you the same person you were twenty years ago? Broaden your tastes and allow artists the room to do the same. Take a chance. At any rate, this album is the kind of thing people will look back at with 20/20 hindsight and glorify, but for now we can just ride the Megadeth gravy train.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Even after all the great albums Rush has released, I still consider A Farewell to Kings their masterpiece.  Over the past 30+ years I have absolutely worn out a vinyl copy and the originally issued CD.  I've been working on the remaster now.  It all came together for the band on this release.  Not as commercially successful as some of their other albums, but for my money, \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" will always stand as their crowning achievment.
0307593312|2.0|I have read all but 1 of murakami's novels and his book about Running and The Tokyo Gas attack. I have enjoyed them all, some more than others, but overall I really liked reading his books. That being said, I have no idea what happened to this book. It was about 350 pages too long. I found myself skipping half of each of the final 15 chapters because the majority of each one was just a recap of what had happened up until that point. As in all his books the plot was creative and the characters somewhat interesting, but I found the writing in this book to be horrible. IT was boring and seemed to me that he was being forced to write it instead of writing it for his own enjoyment. I am baffled that it is winning all this praise because i found it to be, for lack of a better word, very boring.

B005CMSDLE|2.0|This movie, on paper had everything going for it, a great cast including 2 of the greatest Australian actors on the planet, the sublime Ms.Cate Blanchett, the magnificent Mr. Eric Bana backed up by the stunning Ms.Saoirse Ronan. It had a pulsating soundtrack provided by the Chemical Brothers,it had action,stunning fight scenes, stunning locations , what went wrong? Simply a script that was jerky,messy and bloody awful backed up by poor direction. I really wanted to love this film but was so disappointed and can only give it 2 stars! Joe Wright after the greatness of Atonement you should hang your head in shame with this sub standard effort!
B006GLQIVC|5.0|There are currently two shows I'll even watch, and this is one of them.  Super scary and shocking at times, it definitely keeps things interesting.  It's refreshing to see a show that takes place outside of the proverbial 'box'.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Korn haven't sounded this energized for a long time. Yeah, it's basically the Jonathan Davis band at this point, but it doesn't change the fact that this album is awesome. Alot of their more recent material is pretty crappy, but I respect their creativity and realize that, like all innovators, they have always felt a need to stay interested in the art; that means taking chances. Korn have always been willing to take chances, something that has always kept me in their good graces despite their sometimes horrible results.  Do you know what the weakest cliche is nowadays? It's to be a Korn hater, just for the sake of being part of the trendsters. I'm not talking about genuine dislike; I'm talking about those former fans/hipsters that have decided it's really cool to bombard every Korn article and review with shallow comments and blanket statements just to make themselves appear cooler than you and me. I'm excited once again to be one of the metalhead minorities that have the balls to be open minded enough to like what they like. This is one experiment that happened to work better than some of their recent ones. I don't know anything about \\"dubstep\\", I just know that the songwriting is excellent here and, except for the annoying \\"Sanctuary\\", I don't skip any other tracks on this one. I also haven't been this pumped to see Korn live in a long time. This stuff has to absolutely crush in a live setting.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|TV is interesting again.  I rarely watch anything from television, but this is definitely entertaining. Pretty graphic, but that makes it more believable in my opinion.

0385535139|5.0|I am a long-time John Grisham fan and was happy to get his latest installment. Having read other lawyer mystery-thrillers lately, it was once again very easy to see the superior quality of Grisham's novels. As usual, he grabs you right from the start and keeps you engaged throughout the book. Unlike the works of some other authors, this book does not run out of plot or force an ending that is neither interesting or plausible. Since I am familiar with it first hand, his insight into the less than glamorous life of a lawyer (as not seen on TV) was very accurate. Bravo, Mr. Grisham, keep up the good work.

0439023521|5.0|Twilight eat your hearts out. It is because of you that I stopped reading; wondering how books of that caliber can still get produced. But I digress...  HUNGER GAMES is a FANTASTIC read, once I started on the first page, I just simply could not put the book down. I first heard the existence of this book from watching a preview on Youtube of the upcoming move. The preview looked very intriguing, it reminded me of a Japanese movie that I watched a while ago. More about that later. I didn't want to wait for the movie and really would like to know more about the story of Hunger Games so I decided to buy this book. The moment I started reading this book, I knew I made the right choice of buying it. The storyline is fantastic, right away it captivated me into Hunger Game's world. I understood everything the main protagonist was going through, her struggles and how she prevailed. Although the decisions she made were sometimes questionable, it's totally understandable. The author made great use of every human emotions and was able to captivate me from beginning to the end. This book is highly recommended!!   On another topic, a Japanese movie called, Battle Royale had very similar premises. The basic story of this movie is that a group  of classmates were sent on an island, and only 1 can survive in 3 days. If more than 1 lives, then everyone will die. Definitely give this movie a try if you fancy this type of story line.
B004U52VPS|2.0|This game is too high priced for the value.  No one really wanted to play it as a game, they lost interest quickly.  They just wanted to set it up and try to knock over the pieces. Once they did that a couple of times, the interest was gone. They were disappointed in the number of birds and pigs included.  Everyone likes the electronic version and felt this was a waste. All thumbs down on this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Everything syncs well.  Great to keep all my face info. Things on my desktop instantly came onto my Kindle Fire, not one problem. And you can't beat free.

0439023513|1.0|What was that, Suzanne Collins???  Was this book written by the same author that penned the first 2 installments of 'The Hunger Games'?  Her name is on the cover.....I guess she must have been \\"hijacked\\"  I agree with the many comments on the lack of character develpoment.  It also seems that some of the storylines from the previous 2 books were just forgotten about in favor of some sort of demented anti-war message.  The book felt rushed and lacked in emotion and detail.  An extreme disappointment and failure.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|Great movies, no doubt!!!<br /><br />The package IT'S NOT WORTH IT, blurays come separated it by foam ... thetoy chest it's not<br />impressive, pretty expensive for what it is.<br /><br />If you can buy separately, do it guess it's cheaper

B006AN4Y2Q|5.0|One of the things that Primeval does best is encapsulated storylines. This is one of their best, with the ARC team trapped aboard a submarine with a prehistoric baby sea creature. It goes from bad to worse when the sub is sucked into the anomoly with much larger prehistoric sea creatures banging the submarine about like a toy. The British Navy raises the stakes even higher by sending a torpedo to nuke the anomoly with the submarine inside. James Lester battles the British Navy over the right to command and bring about the correct solution. And in the end, someone has a lot of explaining to do to the Prime Minister. Great episode.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I prefer Business calendar and G tasks. They both have good widgets, reminders and over all configurability. I have 5 different screens on my phone, each about a different aspect of my life. I put my different google task list on each of screen.
B005WQPDJK|5.0|When a museum curator is murdered and an art piece worth $50 million is stolen, Castle and Beckett are ordered by Captain Gates to team up with a former art thief turned insurance fraud investigator. The woman is hot and sexy and gives Beckett a run for her money during the case and with Castle who is clearly smitten with her \\"assets\\". The elevator scene with the swat team is reminiscent of the Ghostbusters in a hotel elevator and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Just a hilarious visual in an elevator with Muzak to make us laugh out loud. You might recognize the police psychiatrist (Michael Dorn - Star Trek/Worf) and Joy McHugh the wealthy socialite (Jessica Tuck/True Blood.)  Anton McHugh the wealthy husband was played by James Read (Charmed/Victor.) This episode kept me guessing until the end.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|I gave up after watching about half of the movie. Hal Jordan is nothing like he is in the comics. Who is this goofy, irresponsible person that becomes Green Lantern and eventually (I assume) learns to be responsible? It was painful to watch, and I had no investment in the characters.<br /><br />Maybe it would have been better if I'd never read the comics, so be warned if you're a geek like me.
B00671CU4U|5.0|The A story features a creature that has long been underground burrowing through the earth with a huge nest in a construction site. The B story has James Lester being interviewed about a knighthood. The interview with Lester goes extremely well, but not for the reason Lester had anticipated. The burrowing creature is from the future, and Matt's knowledge about it piques Abby's interest in Matt's background. However it is Connor's ingenuity that saves the day.
B004UO4AYE|1.0|Sprich Deutsch! is not what you might mistakenly (albeit logically) infer from its title. It is not a language-learning aid, but rather a reprinting of a WWI era treatise on the polution of the German language through the germanicizing of foreign vocabulary. It is written entirely in scholarly German and intended for a fluent German-speaking audience. Unless you are a historical linguist or Germanicist by profession or hobby, this e-book is not likely worth the download time, and certainly not worth purchasing in hard copy.
B005ZD3WUC|5.0|This episode began by showing a ghost hunter reality show and then delving into the host's murder. Using an old house that had been plagued by unnatural happenings over the years gave the story a great setting. Was it supernatural events or something else that murdered the reality show host and a previous occupant? The ending solves more than one murder and finally brings a killer to justice.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The movie was very well scripted with great acting.  Unfortunately, some of the symbolism was lost in the adaptation; for example in the book, the color of her car is white; so essentially it's a white woman, driving a white car in a white neighborhood. It doesn't feel the same when you change the color of the car.  Nevertheless, I had to buy the movie as soon as it was released.
B0064JGWYY|5.0|When an Atlantic City Casino owner is murdered, Captain Gates decides to divide and conquer the team during the investigation. Ryan, Esposito and Castle go to Atlantic City and Becket and Gates work the NYC area. In the B story, Alexis throws a girls night in party that escalates to a free for all thanks to Facebook and Twitter. The boys are kicked out of the casino in the middle of their investigation but sneak back in as - you guessed it - Elvis impersonators. I would have given anything to hear the three of them sing. Meanwhile Alexis plays beat the clock to clean up before her dad gets home. There were plenty of people who hated the casino owner, but the murderer was pretty obvious from the beginning of the episode. Still it was fun to watch the boys in Elvis costumes, and watch Alexis' world spin out of control.
B005DOKK7Q|2.0|I found other styles available locally for the same price that I feel would have been more useful. It would be nice to be able to read with the Kindle attached to the sleeve.
B00622HJ4K|5.0|While Martha tries to get a bank loan for her business, Castle calls Beckett begging for a murder (but not the paperwork that goes with it.) Castle realizes they are in the middle of a bank robbery in progress and Beckett's team rushes to the scene. Beckett soon becomes a part of the hostage negotiation team, but conducts her own investigation on the side. When it is clear it is not a straight up robbery (a safety deposit box is stolen, the owner is murdered, and C4 explosives are planted in the bank), Castle works with Beckett to discover the true crime in progress and stop a man who is willing to kill for what he loves. This is a great episode, reminding the major characters and viewers that your wonderful life can be changed in an instant when it is touched by the violence of others.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I wanted a non-bulky, sleek but easy to handle case with a screen protector. This is it. The clear case doesn't hide my white phone and will definitely protect both sides from scratches. Didn't expect a case to prevent breaking when dropped - those are cumbersome. This one is resilient and easy to remove from my pocket.
B006HPTP4O|5.0|Connor and Philip create a man made anomoly never considering the consequences. Enter super beetles from the future that can eat through concrete and wiring as they munch their way through the ARC and out into the underground parking garage. As the ARC team tries to contain the disaster, Philip demands that Connor keep sending data from his made made anomoly. Connor begins to have second thoughts about his work with Philip, but realizes he may be too late to change the man made catastrophe Matt came to stop.

B005HWUBZ0|1.0|I saw him on Letterman and enjoyed the song, so I bought the cd.  When I received it I was shocked at the foul language on the cd.  It was not the song I heard on Letterman.  Wish I could get my money back.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I'm not sure if it's the wifi-only connectivity or the lack of GPS, but this app locks up frequently on my fire or throws errors. The app looks great when it works, but if it is going to be \\"fire friendly\\" it should account for data connectivity not being a constant.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|So, I've read other reviews about the album being somewhat boring and not what they expected.  In my opinion they're missing the point of the cd. First of all, don't buy the mp3 download, you're missing the context of the cd.  2nd of all, you're missing an honest, beautiful, and sweet introduction in the album pamphlet by Mark Ronson.    It's about context not just content, and if you're a true Amy Winehouse fan you'll appreciate the cd regardless.  It may not be as \\"exciting\\" as Back to Black, but it is exactly what I expected, and I love it.  I'm confident any honest fan will feel the same. Totally worth it
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a sweet little app that will analyze available networks to the access point level. It will help the home user pick out the best channel for their wireless access point and will help the IT pro do a quick scan of their wireless infrastructure to catch dead spots or areas of overlap.
B00008973A|3.0|Had I not seen the stage version before, I would give this film four or five stars instead of three.But there is not respect here for the heart and soul of the story.    The way \\"defeated\\" Cassie and \\"lonely\\" Zach relate is OK with me.Very restrained yet powerful. And ,may be, thinking about Bennett and McKechnie [back to the future]. My favority line: \\"Cassie.... JESUS!\\" Too many shots of Cassie, though.    In my opinion the major transgression, among many, is the treatment of \\"What I did for love\\". This song is a collective statment about TEMPORARITY [\\"the gift was ours to borrow\\"],INEVITABILITY [\\"WE did what WE had to do\\"], and WORTHINESS [\\"can't regret\\"].It is not a personal love song.[ONE is the real love song ,disguised as a flashy crowd-pleasing number!]    The song is so beautiful that I would not mind Cassie singing the ending again, after Diana. Imagine.. As she stands on the catwalk, the rehearsing dancers stop, turn to her and join the singing with intense passion...  [fade & blackout?].    My dream is one day a new movie will be made, the right way. Then, we will not have to rely only on video clips and memories.WE did what WE had to do.Yes,I know...I did it myself.    Now, in defense of Attenborough:  The movie got two GOLDEN GLOBE nominations[best director,best picture]and three ACADEMY AWARD nominations[including \\"surprise surprise\\"]. At least we got  something... plus \\"Every little step\\".   I am grateful for both.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I'm not sure why this cover has so many negative ratings. The cover is functional, gets out of the way when you need it, and protects my fire nicely. The elastic band works like a moleskin cover and unopened most people think it's a journal at first look. My only gripe is a bit of a backhanded comment: The back shell is so solid, the cover is touchy as a stand. I've only had it slip once and of course the cover protected the fire, but it would have been better to have a deeper and narrower back channel to support the stand.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I have put 3 hours into playing it and I really like it. It's fun to play, the combat is good. It took a little bit to get the hang of moving your guy, and you can get caught on the background environment easily. Going into the options and reading the Help manual does help to understand somethings in the game.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Fing may not have all the features and information that's available in a product like kismet for linux, but it is very close. I can pull out my kindle fire and analyze the available networks in a new location and run some quick utilities to see how responsive the available networks are and connect to the best one. It's also great to analyze your home network to identify services running on home computers that could be a security risk.
B005P89F1C|5.0|I love this album. It is original and has a great mix of great beats and lyrics. I love the old with the new. I got this CD for my daughters 11Th birthday...what 11 Year old doesn't love Justin Bieber? It is also the first xmas cd I have purchased in several years. Was totally worth it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote works on every platform of device I own, MacOS, IOS, Windows, Blackberry, and Android. It's a great note synchronization system that lets you keep tasks, class notes, christmas lists, etc. on multiple devices.  Your imagination is the limiting factor of what evernote could do for you. You could put your DVD/Blu-Ray collection in a note to check quickly if you see an impulse buy in the store you think you may or may not already own. I own 3 copies of Terminator 2 for this very reason. The same would hold true for books, music, etc.
1451648537|5.0|I sat down and read it in four days!  Excellent coverage on the life of a weird genius.  Best book I read in a long time.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This was easily my favorite movie of 2010 and have shared it repeatedly as a gift. Clare Danes gives an amazing performance and Catherine O'Hara will melt your heart. But more importantly, this film does a brilliant job illustrating the comprehension of an autistic mind as well as the importance of the film's real star, Temple Grandin herself. My relationship with animals has been forever changed for the better thanks to this movie and to this woman. I can not recommend this film enough!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|The movie is fun but what I'm happy about is Warner Brothers paying attention and taking action so quickly.  Yes it still has an ultraviolet copy but now includes an iTunes copy as well.  I am delighted... Thanks

140053271X|3.0|A few points of introduction:<br />* I am absolutely Enamored with e-readers,<br />* I own both a Nook & a Kindle and have used both of them extensively.<br />* I have spent many hours analyzing both devices to determine whether I should commit<br />  to Kindle or Nook because I wanted the bulk of my library to be on a single device.<br /><br />And now let me mention one factor of my comparison that will not apply to everyone: I am Constantly making notations & highlights in my books, so the usability of the annotation feature is critical.<br /><br />So here is how they compare in my view:<br /><br />Advantage: NOOK<br />* Nook's Fonts are simply Gorgeous!  Nook offers SIX Professional & Distinct Fonts: Caecilia, Malabar, Amasis, Gill Sans, Helvetica, & Trebuchet -- 3 are Serif -- 3 Sans Serif, they are all excellent choices for e-readers, & 3 of the fonts are exceptionally legible.  In unfortunate contrast, Kindle offers a generic Serif, a generic Sans Serif, & something they call \\"Condensed\\".<br />Nook's screen is crystal clear & glare resistant; and their lovely fonts provide an elegant reading experience.<br />  I must confess to you, I found Nook's Font Superiority Compelling, and when combined with the fact that the device itself sports a superior, more elegant design, I truly wanted Nook to prevail in this contest.  But Alas, there was also a chink in Nook's fine suit of armor; nay, not a chink but a fatal missing piece . . .<br />--------------------<br /><br />Advantage: KINDLE<br />* Kindle's Annotations Feature is Vastly Superior over Nook's.  The Notes I make on my device instantly sync across my devices & my Laptop, and they are also backed up on Amazon's Website.  I thus have perfect access to my annotations on my PC, e.g.: to Cut & Paste into my word processor.<br />In contrast, Nook's Annotation \\"Feature\\" is Abysmal:  The Notes I make on my Nook do Not sync to my PC (or vice versa), and thus there is NO WAY to copy them into my word processor(!), Nor are the Notes backed up.  This, my friend, is both ridiculous and a FATAL Flaw.  And this is the reason that the only time I use my Nook anymore is for those very rare times when there is an ebook available in epub format that is unavailable on Amazon.<br /><br />* Amazon offers a wondrous feature that makes the highlighting of my fellow-readers visible in my books.  You can toggle this feature on & off, and there is an Amazon site that lets you view readers' highlighting for ANY book--not just the books you own.  I have Greatly benefited from this feature because: 1. It has often cued me to helpful passages that I had not fully appreciated; and 2. Perusing other readers' highlighting helps me to assess whether those books would really be a good investment of my time & money.<br /><br />* Amazon has slightly better paid ebook coverage than does B&N, and Kindle ebooks are often cheaper than Nook ebooks.<br /><br />* It is FAR more pleasant searching for books on Amazon than on B&N, and Amazon offers Many more book reviews.  Amazon's website is so much better than B&N's that, during the period that I was so hoping that Nook would win, I would still search for the ebook on Amazon before buying it on B&N.<br /><br />* When my Kindle is fully powered OFF, it starts up Instantly;  My Nook takes almost half a minute to boot up from Full Off.<br /><br />* I can read my Kindle books on my BlackBerry;  Barnes & Noble Used to support BlackBerry but recently chose to abandon us.<br /><br />* I have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with B&N's customer service.

0439023491|5.0|My, 13 year old son, read the \\"Hunger Games\\" book as assigned reading over this past summer.  He started reading it the way he reads most books, reluctantly.  He could NOT put the book down.  He actually asked me to buy the next two books in the series so he's getting both for Christmas.  Haven't read them yet but if the first book is any indication these gifts will be a winner.  As a caution, I personally read this book as I was told it had mature content and wanted to make sure I could answer any questions my son might have.  I would NOT recommend this book for younger children; I would go as far as to say it is inappropriate for younger children.
B001GSTOAM|4.0|It's a great book. Every programmer should read it. It's a pity references are not of hyper-linked. And it's specially a pity in chapters 16 and 17 where you have at least 10 references to heuristics in every page.  I would highly recommend a refactored edition with the references hyper-linked in the name of usability.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|nice work.  love the synch to other devices.  will be a while until I max out on this one. so tr simple notes and lists r easy on kindle and laptop.  Iphone seems to be slightly trickier to use.  on Iphone making a list sucks because you have to restart each line with a checkbox.  otherwise I find it all failry straight forward so far.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Album of the year. Lyrically and emotionally charged. Lots of slow and zone-out drake so if you're not into that it probably won't live up to expectation but if you are a fan, album is crazy. loved it, still on repeat
B000000XB9|3.0|The cd I got was mastered in 1994, not 1990 like Amazon says. This matters if you prefer that music not have all the dynamic range compressed out. This cd is very loud, probably one of the loudest I own. I bought it because I though I would get a cd mastered in 1990, which would have the dynamic range intact.<br /><br />It's a good collection of songs. Get it if you like CCR but don't own any of their material. Just be aware that you may find the sound quality lacking if you prefer the more natural sound of intact dynamic range in music.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|BLU RAY IS WORTH IT! i bought this with a hunch and 110% glad i did, this movie is amazing. its original, its funny, its serious, its a great movie. I am definitely a devoted fan and i knew that within minutes of watching the movie,( i watched it 4x in a row.) even the special features were amazing and hilarious. but this is def a \\"boys\\" film. cant wait to see what the director and the actors do/go next.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind by Nirvana is a true classic album. Some say it's overrated, but it's not. All the songs on this album are great.  People often talk about this album because it ended the reign of hair metal and began the grunge movement that ruled the early 90s. It's true, but even forgetting all that, this is still an excellent album, worthy of many listens.  Even if no one had ever heard of Nirvana, these songs would still stand up on their own.

B004P4S4NM|5.0|My favorite song for the year was the free Amazon giveaway of Adele's \\"Someone Like You,\\" the ACOUSTIC version. Just her and her piano. It was only in the free album section for a day or so. It's somewhat distorted (like it was recorded with the volume too high). I wish they sold it. It's really pretty.  If anyone knows where to get it, post it.
0307891372|5.0|This ultimate guide is truly ultimate! The poster that came with this is fantastic and the guide itself is very detailed and gives you insight into all the quests available so you can look through and see where you want to explore next. This is also helpful if you get stuck on a particular mission and need a little assistance, which is rare with their new system of waypoints.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Thanks you guys!  I needed this item and found it, and it was on sale!  It arrived quickly, 2 days before the estimated arrival date.  Thanks again, Amazon!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I found this app to be very useful and easy to use! Works on and syncs to many platforms like the kindle fire, iPhone, and computer.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This is a fine rretrospective. I've had Bruce in my house since the first record and he and I were both young and pretty. No one is perfect, but Springsteen is always listenable and enjoyable and sometimes wonderful and a few times transcendent. And the band is a marvel. God's sax section is up a notch since we lost CC but it will be different and still good as long as Bruce keeps writing that miraculous poetry and singing like some badass Angel.<br /><br />I feel like a troglodyte for not commenting on production values, earlier tracks that were better and on and on. I didn't know there were so many people who are better than the slugs that will begrudgingly work for Springsteen and better at choosing tracks than the guy who made the tracks, but I'm stupid and they're not. It happens a lot for me.<br /><br />BUT if you gots to git you a tub load of The Boss all in one place. This set is your huckleberry. Or so I think.
B005F3XV7Q|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE MY HUSBAND AND I. THE PACKAGING  THAT IT CAME IN VERY VERY SECURE. WHEN I PURCHASE FROM AMAZON I AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED ALWAYS TIMELY AND ACCURATE.

B000FC2KL0|4.0|The story of this young man is very intriguing.... Funny how muscians who put all their efforts into a single career path have some many trials and tribulations in their lives. It was a great read and shows how difficult it is when you choose this path... drugs in the industry iS rampent and will catch most of these trouble youths who chose this path.. its the inevetable... and how this man survived is surreal. Good for him....   Fan of RCP!

B004INNRFK|5.0|I just viewed the Blu-Ray version, and the show was fantastic! I am a huge fan of live music, and I was very impressed with both the quality of the show and the talent involved. There are some nice bonus parts of the show that was completely unexpected, but very welcome. I must admit, my favorite segment is with Earth Wind, and Fire, and they did a spectacular job! The included music CD was a welcome bonus. The sound and video is top notch. My only request is that he create another concert soon!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I been looking for a Rss reader and this does the job amazingly.  The content there and the format is great.

B005FNPIG8|4.0|Yup, the Muscles from Brussels has played a peculiarly large part in my life and in the life of my only son. I don't remember why but I started dragging my son to every Van Damme movie since JCVD's movie career began...later the roles were reversed with him dragging me and then of course everything went direct to video and \\"new releases\\" were enjoyed at one of our homes rather than at a movie house.<br />This movie is MUCH better than the vast majority of Jean Claude's early works...even those with a legitimate budget. Van Damme has aged incredibly well for a man with a known history of self abusive tendencies...it appears as if Jean Claude might remember filming this little gem of a movie.<br />The co-star, whose name I immediately forgot, tried desperately to steal this movie..it almost seemed like JCVD was used as a launch device for whatisnames career..didn't work. I only remember Van Damme's role....whatever, I am wool gathering now.<br />Good film and a joy to watch. I highly recommend the movie and ask that everyone continue to provide Jean Claude with enough vice money to make his life liveable for him. He always pays you back with interest.<br />Thank you Jean!
B004X80QNG|2.0|I like the look of this app but it does not sync with my Google calendar which is a must for me.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie....what else is there to say about a movie called \\"Stake Land\\"? DeNiro isn't in it, I don't think his gardner would agree to star in a movie like this....but I bet the DeNiro household has a twisted member that would enjoy this movie as much as I did. Good movie to watch and re-watch.<br />For a best buy, grab one used in excellent condition from a highly rated Amazon vendor. Amazing the finds one can stumble upon shopping like that.

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite new group.  She turned me on to  the  song \\"If I Die Young\\" so I ordered the cd.  It is a good country-bluegrass  work and I play it often.  Recommended for any bluegrass fan, they sound  a little like a cross between the Wreckers and Alison Krauss.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|I generally do not like posthumous albums due to greedy record labels doing a rush job and making it sound tacky and not the way the artist had intended or would approve of. But this release isn't like that, it shines with Amy's personality. It was made with love and care and it provides her fans with comfort and it compliments her eternal legacy. I love the album but my favorites are 'Between the cheats', 'Wake up alone', and 'Best friends right'. 'Halftime' is very good also. The one thing about this cd that I don't like is the final song on it 'A song for you'. Let me explain why. The reason is that it was never meant to be fully mastered, Amy sung it acoustically while playing her guitar. The overproduction and editing is very noticeable and irksome. I think Salaam, the producer, should've only added instruments such as another guitar, harmonica, some snaps. However, his intentions were good. So with that said, I'd definitely recommend a purchase of this album.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|I've been enjoying Tom Waits' newest album, Bad As Me, immensely. It's one part funk and soul, one part nostalgic melancholy, and equal parts classic rock and roll. \\"Hell Broke Luce\\" is just so much fun to listen to and upbeat and just a little bit crazy. And I swear I heard a bit of the ol' Buddy Holly twang in the bonus track \\"Tell Me\\" mixed with some bluesy tinges. The man is so versitile. I highly recommend the album '
B0000646QH|4.0|I read Remote Control when it was first published in paperback but am about to buy it again (for Kindle, if it's available).<br /><br />Ironically I first bought Remote Control in the Borders book store in Tyson's Corner which in the book was one of the suburban metropolitan DC strip malls that McNab describes in excruciating and accurate detail in his opening chapters.<br /><br />Borders is of course closed now but the strip mall where it used to exist (in 1999) is described quite vividly, right up to the dumpsters and rear store entrances. Back in 1999 or 2000, I actually went to the the various Tyson's strip malls described in the book and have no doubts whatsoever that \\"Andy McNab\\" - whoever he may be - might actually have walked those same areas.<br /><br />It's probably also relevant that Tyson's Corner area is quite packed with intelligence agency support companies.<br /><br />Then McNab moves on to hotels in Crystal City, Virginia (only a couple miles away from Tyson's), which are immediately south of the Pentagon and - perforce - packed with yet more military intelligence activities.<br /><br />So for me Remote Control may have had a slightly different effect than on other readers: it begins with a detailed local geography and phenomenon which \\"McNab\\" has portrayed quite accurately even though in fiction.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I bought this set from the amazon sales that have been going on, I couldn't be happier! You get all of the Matrix related disc in a nice compact case. The video quality looks great on my 40\\" Sony LCD TV being played from my PS3. Audio is just as great playing from my Sony surrounds sound with HK speaker set.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This includes all the \\"That's Entertainment\\" compilations that were issued throughout the 1980's and 1990's.  It's an excellent overview of the work that was done in Hollywood throughout the 40's, 50's, and 60's in musical theater.  A wonderful way to enter the world of Hollywood musicals.
B004MNVKVO|3.0|The main gripe I have about the blu-ray is it does not have a lossless hd format like some movies have. I use a Yamaha YSP 4100 sound processor to listen to audio and video and the lossless discs I have sound better. The processor has a limited sound field  and cannot reproduce a pure soundtrack.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app works as described, it lets you lock down a device with a menu of apps you select. Works great on kindle fire.  It would be nice to be able to change the background colors though.
B003OCFJ7U|5.0|Don't listen to that other reviewer.  This is the full length, uncut Italian version of Phenomena that is longer than all other versions of the movie.  There are a few brief scenes that weren't even on the Anchor Bay DVD.  Since they were never dubbed, they are presented on this Blu-ray in Italian with subtitles.  The picture quality is very good - perhaps they used a little DNR, but it looks very sharp on my TV.  The extras include an almost hour-long documentary.  It's definitely the best available edition of this film, which continues to polarize Argento fans.  Personally, it's always been a favorite of mine.  If you love Phenomena, do not hesitate to buy this great release.
B005J7K950|2.0|Having brought Metropolis Redux i thourght the picture would be as good but it is rubbish reading the back of this DVD they know of this print but did not use it i don't know why.<br />Now for the plus side the 5.1 is great so are the special features if they had put the two together i would of given this DVD 5 stars.
0312117337|5.0|These tarot cards are set up in a similar way to a tarot deck, but the focus is less on predicting the future and more on gaining insight into the present. Or the \\"now\\". I've been interested in Zen and Buddhism for years. I have books on them which have been somewhat helpful. I feel like these cards have helped me make the transition from an intellectual understanding to a deeper awareness. After I use the cards, I feel calm, centered and hopeful. The book that comes with the cards gives detailed descriptions of the ideas for the card, along with a message from Osho. Thank you to the makers of the deck. The cards have helped me through some tough times.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The detail in which this was produced rivals Charles Dickens' detailed writing. You can watch it over and over and catch somethng new each time, not unlike an annual re-read of the classic from which it is taken.  The story,retold, mixes humor for today, with commentary & satire of the era it represents to seamlessly bring the tale to a new generation who will undoubtedly believe it is a new story.   You can not be a true fan of Jim Henson and not watch this motion picture, no more than a true Dickensian scholar would skip over his most famous yarn.   Buy two give one as a gift. A geat DVD for all year.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|My 93 yr old mother is extremely hard of hearing.  She had a similar device, but it broke.  After much comparing, I bought this.  The TV can now be turned down to  a normal level.  It also works great for conversation (carry it in pocket), if you just accept the fact the headset has to be on your ears.  The price is what got me & I am very happy with this & so is my mother.
0312427565|5.0|When I talk about the \\"The Right Stuff,\\" people talk about the movie, but as usual, the book is better. This is the book I give to reluctant readers, who then gobble it up.  Twenty years after I first read \\"The Right Stuff,\\" it still holds a special thrilling place in my heart.  I'm back to buy a copy for my teenage son, who is interested in flying.  History is history, and so much better when brought into full living color (inside your head).

1400031362|3.0|I imagine these books might turn off a certain kind of reader because of their repeated moral lessons (fat people are okay, don't judge books (or people) by their covers, women aren't appreciated, man are immature etc), but I continue to find them rewarding to read. They are short, they move fairly quickly and nothing particularly horrible ever happens. What draws the reader through is M Ramotswe, the head of the lady detective agency, and her side kick (and now assistant manager) Mma MaKutsi.  While Mma Ramotswe is tolerant of other people's weaknesses, she does not let people walk all over her and she always solves the crime in a morally correct way, neatly wrapping up the problems by the end of the novel.  In this installment, M and M are moving their detective business from their original place of business to join Ramotswe's fiance in his car repair shop, to save them all money.  But, meanwhile, Ramotswe's fiance has fallen victim to a depression and Makutsi has to take over the auto shop while Ramotswe attempts to get her fiance help for his illness and to solve a \\"Government officials\\" fear that his brother is being poisoned by his wife.  As usual, Smith examines the issue of beauty and character (Makutsi has to investigate the contestants for a beauty contest), relationships and honesty.  There are no surprises in the novel, but there is some humor, great description and fun dialogue.

B004EPYZSU|2.0|Just got this today.  My Blue Ray player in my computer has been trustworthy until now.  It will not play this.  After two lengthy downloads to 'update' my device, it still does not play.  Stay away from this disk, is all I can advise.  Edit:  It's not any better with a working codex.  After much hassle, I did get a codex that works with this disk, but the content of the movie will not play.  The commercials work just fine--they loop and play and play.  The menu for the movie appeared once, and when I selected to play the movie, it looped back into the commercials.  Now, it won't even give me that menu.  Three reboots later, still the same.  Not good, folks.  Talk about a soup sandwich, the mangled mess that was put out as a finished product here is sure one.  Edit2:  Got it to run, though it dropped out and started through the advertisements after the first scene.  It did pick up about where it left off though, once I went through the gyrations of restarting it.  I upped the star count by one because I got a grin out of the movie and did sort of get it to play.  I'd still suggest that this Blu ray version not be purchased.
B005K8H8W0|5.0|I bought the new reissue of the album on vinyl and it is nice. It is a double LP. Plays well. Album is great, of course.  The LPs are in thin paper inner sleeves, but together with them included additional inner sleeves made of thicker paper. These have writings on them (names of the songs etc). I don't know why they did that and if we are supposed to get rid of the thin sleeves. The problem is that if you want to keep everything as it came, it is really hard to take out and then slide back in the LPs. Otherwise, great product.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|This film inspires lots of thoughts about your own life and redemption.  The human element was not over shadowed by the SciFi elements.  I believe it was well blended.

0786955570|5.0|I bought this game because my friends and I used to play Dungeons & Dragons casually, and I was starting to get back into the fantasy genre.  It was a great purchase, and I was not disappointed at all.  This game is all about strategy and cooperation.  Sure, you can play it on your own, but it is much more fun with a group of people.  My boyfriend and I played this game for the first time together and fell in love with it.  I immediately purchased the third game in the series, The Legend of Drizzt, a few days later.  The best part about these games is you can combine the heroes, the villains, the monsters, and the tokens together.  You might get tired of seeing a Wraith pop up, so having a big monster card stack is pretty wonderful.  I plan on buying the second game, Wrath of Ashardalon, as soon as I have enough spare money.  The only hassle is that the boxes are quite large, and carrying around all three can be a bit burdensome.  I also wish there was a tad bit more customization with your character, but really, this is meant to be a casual, action-packed adventure.  It has inspired my friends and I to go back to playing the real deal.

It's a little tall so it may not fit in smaller cases, but other than that it's the best thing out there. Pretty quiet as well. I have one in my Gaming PC and one in my Hackintosh. Both are really quiet.
1451648537|5.0|This book was captivating to me because it explored the guy that Steve was, including the good, the bad and the incredible.  From beginning to end it was an enthralling read.  I didn't want a bunch of \\"techno\\" stuff that nobody could understand.  I wanted information about Steve's life.  Sure it would have been nice to get more detail but I think the author did a masterful job of sorting out from his many many interviews with Steve, his wife, his family and his colleagues and business associates information that was stimulating, revealing and appealing in the way it was organized.  I personally have appreciated the opportunity to be allowed to snoop into his life through this book enough to get a feel for what made him tick.  Thanks to Steve and his family for allowing all of us into their lives through this book.

1594484805|5.0|If I had to pick one book from today's time to say is my favorite, Drive would be it. From Dan Pink's engaging writing style, to how he is able to relate the unrelatable, and does it all in a very mater-of-fact, common sensical, yet everyday language. Highly recommend!Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose - I live by it :-)
B000AGTPUK|4.0|Great movie! Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside about the anticipation of Christmas. Great kids movie. My kids and I all watch this movie every year.

0783219695|4.0|From the film itself to the commentaries with either th actual astronaut, Jim Lovell, or the director Ron Howard, you grow tremendously to love and appreciate this movie for its technical achievements and an era of exploration that is lost to today's society.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I watch it on my dishNetwork download and It was great the young lady playing the part was very sweet and she did good job. The surfing parts were also real good. It is a real family type movie you can watch over and over.  It gets a 4 star rating from me and to bad Hollywood cannot make more movies like this one. Buy it rent it borrow it  it is well worth it.
B006HDLEY0|5.0|This mid season finale focused mainly on Bobby Singer. I must say this season is not as exciting as others but thats ok it all works out for a reason.<br />I must of missed where Cass was killed off for good earlier in the season. I thought he was just possessed by the Leviathan. I miss Cass.<br />Bobby is incredibly important to the show he really helps keep Sam & Dean rooted. It will be interesting to see where this goes come January 2012.

0385534639|5.0|I was amazed by this book. And I don't amaze easily.   I listened to Jim Dale reading this and got completely lost in the world conjured. Angela Carter meets JK Rowlings plus a large dash of The Fair to Middling by Arthur Calder Marshall (anyone remember that?).  Every time it seems to be getting twee or cosy some twist in the writing livens everything up and nothing is predictable.  The physical descriptions of the magical places are all small tour de forces.  Like a circus or travelling show it is a kind of ragbag of cultural references the sum of which make up much more than the scraps/parts. Tsukiko is a kind of Anna May Wong for example, inscrutable, beautiful and as likely to be fiercely loyal as stab you in the back.  Bravo and thank you to Morgenstern and once again bravo to Jim Dale. I was so sad the day after I finished it. I wanted to go back to this world for the first time all over again.
0307891402|5.0|My boyfriend bought this amazing guide book for me, along with the game. The size itself is impressive (and size matters), but more impressive is how thoroughly it explains everything from questlines to where to get yourself the best horse. The index in the back of the book makes it very easy to quickly find whatever information you are looking for. It reminded me of a much larger, more detailed version of the guidebook Prima made for the game's predecessor, Oblivion. And that is a good thing.  The sole complaint I have is that the one time I tried to use the online interactive map (for which you get a code), it was so laggy and unresponsive that I abandoned my attempts to use it and haven't tried again since.

B004FQX5CK|4.0|I saw Blade Runner in the early 80's when if first came out.  This brought back a lot of memories.  Looks very good in Blue-ray.  I guess the only thing I didn't like about it was at the end in the original Deckard talks about how Rachael was special and did not have the 4 year life cycle of the other replicants.  It does not really take away from the film but I was trying to explain it to my 14 year old son who watched it with me.  He understood after I told him about it but it would have been better if he had heard it from Deckard himself.  Maybe the alternate ending leaves a little too much to the imagination.  Anyway, great movie.  Any BladeRunner fan will like it.  Quick delivery; great service as usual.

B0042FZWC0|1.0|I never thought I'd be leaving a one-star review--for any book, especially since I always try to make careful, informed decisions about the books I purchase--but this one is an exception, and a disappointing one at that.<br /><br />After previewing the first chapter of the book, I was hooked. As other reviewers have noted, the first two chapters are a breeze (save for the stories: each time a story came along, reading it felt akin to slowly disembowelling myself: unnecessary details, detours, and an overall sense of boredom is what characterises the case studies).<br /><br />By the time I got to chapter four, however, I wanted to scream. No, not because the book was necessarily bad--I still enjoyed reading most parts of it--but because it felt like a blatant rip-off Tim Ferriss' 4-Hour Workweek, down to the quotes from writers and thinkers (of the numerous quotations strewn all over the book, the strongest and the most relevant seem to have been hand-picked from Tim's book), key ideas (asking for permission vs. asking for forgiveness, anyone?), terminology and writing style, without so much as a bow to the author of said book.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with taking an excellent idea, such as the one behind the 4-Hour Workweek, and building upon it--with one's own example, case studies, and reflexion. It's a wholly different thing to use another person's words without even bothering to rephrase them.<br /><br />In the end, the only original thing about this book turned out to be not-so-original.<br /><br />I don't regret shelling out the $13.90 for the Kindle edition though, careful as I am about my book selection. It was a lesson well-learned.<br /><br />As for Chris, I hope the liberal feeding off others' ideas wasn't intentional and he did at least try to create a work of some originality. Sad to see that he (and I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt here) ran out of steam a few chapters into the book. As for the quality of writing... good writing it ain't, even for this fairly undemanding genre.
0553582038|2.0|Whereas the first three \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" books hurtle breathlessly forward, each chapter fundamentally changing the world and our understanding of it, \\"Feast for Crows\\" takes the meandering-pastiche route. Instead of nail-biting cliffhangers, chapters tend to end on notes like this one, which I just made up:  Cersei looked at the dress. Her lips curled upward in a wicked smile. \\"Fetch my seamstress. Have her take this in at the waist.\\" The girl nodded meekly, retreating from the Queen's chambers. \\"And one more thing.\\" The poor thing turned, trembling like a reed in the summer wind. \\"Have her let the hem out a little. I want it more... swooshy.\\"  Other riveting scenes include:  * Jaime taking a dump.  * Samwell removing a pickle from his sandwich.  * Brienne chancing upon her childhood idol, the Knight of Cheeses, on the King's Road, and getting his autograph.  * Sansa getting her wisdom teeth out.  * Arya trying on hats.
B004GHBQCE|5.0|Cash fan since i was a child & my grandparents played him around the house.  Appreciation just grew up with me.  Don't ever listen to any country music, myself.  The man in black isn't at all country to me, he is pure blues, rock, & soul - hard driven, with a voice that states he's been there & knows;   a somwhat dulcimer to barritone, very manly tone.  He tells moral stories on occassion, about himself; he makes me think of the concesquences I'm responsible for, and where i could end up.  Sometimes he talk-sings to you, you don't walk away unmoved.  Subjects he covers:  Good and evil, justice (some day), shame of ourselves, being poor, traveling, Death, stuggles of all types, love & how that can bring you to your knees too, & pure happiness, pride, enjoyment of life & it's pleasures.  Too many to list.  He covers tracks by various artists' (Depeche Mode, & Trent Reznor) for instance.  These take on new lives, to become their most poignant with Mr. Cash.  He covers every genre & knows no boundaries.  Welcome to the Mr. Johnny Cash Experience.  Only in America.    Bought \\"America 4:  The Man Comes Around\\" cd, because they did not have \\"Unearthed\\" and it had some of the tracks, along with \\"The Legend of CASH\\", i was set.  \\"The Legend\\" has a lot of older songs as well as, 'Dehlia's Dead', & 'Rusty Cage' (orig. by Sound Garden).  Great production also, it's like you are in his home sitting near by.

Se lée con rapidez aunque es un libro de muchas páginas. No me ha cansado leerlo pues está escrito, a mi entender, en un lenguaje muy periodístico, rozando el reportaje.  En conjunto bueno, interesante pero no FASCINANTE.

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I was happy to install this game and my kids loved it and husband too. Unfortunately I just noticed that the permissions Rovio has are unnecessary and intrusive. An app doesn't need your call records, serial number, sim card data, Internet access, and too many others to name. Rovio is bigtime and think all people are too dumb to believe their 'It's so we can customize ads'. I just saw 46,634 people uninstall. Now it's 46,635.

0060873027|1.0|Without a doubt this is the worst book I've read which was published by a major publishing house. The only place in the book where I saw Michael Crichton was in the title. After that it was all downhill. It read like a script for a Saturday night Syfy movie including the bad dialogue and painful setting descriptions.<br /><br />The idea of the book seemed like a sound one. A company develops new Nano technology which allows humans to shrink down to around a half inch in size. Of course there are several things wrong with this premise which are brought up in the story but no attempt was made to explain how it was done. This alone would not keep me from enjoying the book. I've read several science fiction books where the science was totally lost but I still relished the magical trip the author arranged for me.<br /><br />The characters in a Crichton book are usually well developed and rounded out. To put it mildly the characters in this book are flat, one dimensional. On occasion it is hard to tell them apart. Setting descriptions and dialogue are at times painful to read and almost embarrassing.<br /><br />This was a very disappointing book. Don't waste your money on this one.

1878424939|5.0|[[ASIN:1878424939 The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (Four-color Illustrated Ed.) (Toltec Wisdom)]]  Being familiar with the book, I didn't hesitate to make this purchase.  The book arrived ahead of the anticipated arrival date and I'm pleased to have it and pleased with the flawless performance of Amazon, as usual.  What the actual sales process review isn't about, is the book itself and that's what I'd like to address: anyone who is questioning, seeking, troubled, uncertain, questing, searching or even happy and contented can be uplifted by the simple message within the pages of this book.  It is a wisdom that can be adapted by every man, woman and even child, old enough to read about how to deal with the agreements of our human nature.  Consider it a guide to help traverse the path of life.  A superlative gift.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I really LOVE this mobile.  I've had it for about a year now (my daughter is now 15 months old) and it works great.  I bought it in part because there were reviews that it was too quiet (and also because I had other rainforest products my baby liked).  As far as I'm concerned, if it's on the crib and it's playing music for my baby to go to sleep to, I want quiet and soothing.  I leave it on the lower of the two sound levels and I can hear it just fine (even with a humidifier and fan running for white noise in the same room) so I'm pretty sure the baby in the crib can hear it.  The movement of the rainforest animals is very quiet too which is nice. I like the classical music selections as well as the rain forest sounds.  And the light is a low/warm light that isn't disturbing at all to a sleeping (or almost sleeping) baby.  My daughter goes to sleep to it every night and if she wakes up in the night she just hits the button to start it up again and goes back to sleep.  We even travel with it and attach it to the crib at Grandma's house to help my daughter sleep away from home.    The only negative thing I have to say about it is the remote control is pretty much useless.  It appears to only work if you've recently turned the mobile on manually (but you have to use it within about 15 min of turning the mobile on).  I'm not sure what the point of that is.    But overall this has been one of my best purchases and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quiet/soothing mobile.

B004EPYZT4|1.0|Of course Hollywood ruins another remake. The story has no development, no plot. Its made for maybe high school people. There is no relationship to Conan, the story is just surrounding \\"the time at which it all happened\\" . This is definitely one of the worst remakes i have seen.

0374531269|4.0|Poignant and compelling, but could have benefited from a good introduction to provide a little more historical context.  The timeline was helpful, but skeletal.  I also wish that the author had continued his story through his college days at Oberlin, as it would have been fascinating to hear about how he managed to make a successful transition from boy soldier to university graduate despite all the banshees wailing in his head.  A fine book worthy of an attentive read.

B0061JPYX2|4.0|I've read other reviews prior to purchasing this album and although the vast majority were positive, there were those hard-core fans who were disappointed, because they didn't consider this package to be a new third album by Amy, as well as were disappointed that a few tracks/alternative takes of her old songs were included on this.  Well, firstly I must say that I was well aware that prior to buying this album, that the producers and record company had very little vault material to work with and did their best to put together one last album in memory of Amy. And with that said, they did an excellent job producing this project. I was not disappointed. The CD is a good listen from track one until the final track, a rarity in today's music world. I didn't have to or want to skip any track.   Some of my favorites are \\"Our Day Will Come\\" Classic Amy Sound, \\"Tears Dry\\" I love this stripped down version- it highlights her beautiful voice, \\"Like Smoke,\\" this could be a big hit. Nas flows nicely on this track and they both compliment each other. I can see a Grammy Nomination next year for Best Vocal/Rap collaboration, for \\"Like Smoke.\\"  I see from reviews that some did not like Amy's version of \\"The Girl From Ipanema,\\" but I like it a lot, it really shows her jazz vocal styling, as well as it has a nice contemporary hip hop beat, which makes it more modern and approachable to younger audiences. \\"Half Time,\\" is another track that I find outstanding and can see being a hit. As someone else mentioned in their review, if you heard this on the radio, you would swear it was Eryka Badu (another excellent vocalist), they both sound alike on this track. I love the whole grove of this track and can see Neo Soul die-hard fans gravitating to this track.   The last two tracks seem appropriately placed, as \\"Body and Soul,\\" was her last recording, which is an excellent recording that showcases her jazz vocal stylings that is very comparable to Billie Holiday. And the last song, \\"A Song For You, \\" was a bitter-sweet end track, because it sums up her life and career, as she at times struggled and slurred her way through the track, but in the end she delivers her song just for you.
B001G8WXH8|4.0|I am a great follower of Vince Flynn and David Baldacci was recommended as in a similar vein.  Stone Cold is the first Baldacci book I have read.  I was hooked after only a few pages.  I really got wrapped up in the story.  It dragged a little in the second half and the believable became less believable but I will read more of his work.  The chracters were very real and the drama was high.  A quick read.
0061478784|5.0|This is very different from the Hiyao Miazaki movie, but I have to say, I love it.  The added complexity to characters I already love made this book fun and enjoyable to read.  I particularly like the fact that we actually get to see the Waste here as opposed to just hearing about it.  Also, after reading it, I found that even though I still loved the movie, there are some things, like Ms. Angorian and a genuinely young Witch of the Waste, that I missed about the book.  Definitely a good read for any fantasy or Hiyao Miazaki fan.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I am a huge Evangelion fan and have the whole series on DVD. I almost wet myself when I found out it was being remade, so I bought vol 1 on blu-ray. My God does it look amazing. I can't get enough of it. Can't wait for the others!

B004EC5IUW|4.0|The first volume was basically a remake of the first few episodes of the series, scene for scene and I loved it. But You Can [Not] Advance isn't somehow. They added and changed a lot of the story and although it still looks amazing the ending feels like it's basically the end of the series. I'm not sure how there is still 2 more volumes coming out. Still, great series and will continue to buy. Too bad it's pretty much one every year. That's just way too long of a wait for basically a television show.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|This is how remakes are supposed to be done!  It sticks VERY closely to the original, adds substantial input without straying too far outside the original concept's box, refreshes the FX and filming for a modern audience, and throws in a final loop to make it all worthwhile.  Technically, the film is not a remake; it's a prequel, but there is enough content that nearly the entire film feels like an homage.  Very pleasing to someone wanting things to be similar to the original.  And keeping the title the same adds some John Carpenter shape-shifting mystique to the entire film.  Bravo!<br /><br />For those unaware of the original, the plot is simple but insidious: An alien life-form has been found in the remote wintery wilderness of an Antarctica research site cut off from the rest of the world.  The human inhabitants must kill the alien before it reaches the rest of humanity.  The problem, the creature thrives in extreme colds, and can mimic any lifeform's appearance to perfection.<br /><br />It's clear going in that none of the stars of the show have any chance of exuding the gravitas a cast of Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Keith David, and Donald Moffat, the 2011 version does a very fine, professional job of conveying the fear and paranoia of their situation.  I particularly enjoyed Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's performance.  Where the cast lacks, however, is their inability to carry, in relation to the original, the intensity.  Making up for that minor void is a substantial upgrade in action (read: more flamethrowers).  John Carpenter's version: Suspense.  2011 version: Action/Suspense.<br /><br />Where this film scores the most is the story.  A plausible connection to the first film justifies the ample screen time the Thing receives, as well as some truly gruesome assimilations with the unfortunate cast-members.  The assimilations are explained with a bit of pseudo-science, but the exponential cell-to-cell siege is certainly an upgrade to the John Carpenter's version.  As with the first film's \\"blood test\\" reveal, the screen-writers for this film were able to insert an equally ingenious method of determining just which people were actually human.  And for those who don't realize this is a prequel, the end of this film flows so absolutely brilliantly into the original that I wanted the film to keep rolling for another 2 hours.  In true Carpenter fashion, the ending of this film is both ambiguous and fulfilling; it's not a finale in which the viewer wishes for much more.<br /><br />Overall, brilliant remake.  Now that Hollywood finally got one right they can quit trying to ruin the best movies of my child-hood (Looking at you, Will Smith's son and Adam Sandler).the first film's \\"blood test\\" reveal, the screen-writers for this film were able to insert an equally ingenious method of determining just which people were actually human.

1451648537|5.0|If you answer \\"yes\\" to any of these questions, then you ought to read the \\"Steve Jobs\\" biography  1)  Find an example of how the human spirit can change the world (or make a dent in the universe)  2)  Learn about how to stay incredibly focused in order to make one's dreams into a reality  3)  Refine one's business acumen by listening to one's heart and drown the voice of naysayers  ------------  The \\"Steve Jobs\\" biography was one of the best books I read in 2011.  Isaacson went to new depths interviewing Jobs and his acquaintances to paint a full picture of who Jobs was and what drove him.   Isaacson does deserve a great deal of credit for putting this biography together because in many years to come, this biography will not only set the standard for biographies, but also provide a legitimate account to Jobs' legacy for building the future.    To Mr. Jobs and Mr. Isaacson - Thank you for sharing this personal story of human triumph with so many of us.

I must agree with other reviewers, he did this for the money.

Use the recommended generic driver that the installer tells you to use, in under 60 seconds you will be printing.

Install the free one, print test page, and after verifying that it all works.... purchase the paid version and you can print text, phone logs, documents, email , web pages and more. Just about anything you can see can be printed.<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you own one of the newer printers out there with a built in WiFi print server.

Most of the bonus features were a waste of time. I would have preferred seeing some of the documentarys that have been produced (such as the 25 year anniversary special). The movies were great as expected but the box set could have been done better.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie; highly recommended; *****!!! The Blu-Ray edition of this movie looks and sounds great. It's very cool how the opening scenes that were shot in IMAX come accoss in their native aspec ratio and then the film switches to the Buly-Ray aspec ratio; seemlessly.
0307454541|5.0|It's actually good?<br /><br />By the way, a swifty is a \\"fast one\\" in Australian speak, something I proudly learned from reading Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />First off, I didn't have high expectations because when the critics love something, it usually tends to be something I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.<br />However, in this case, I really enjoyed the book, and I feel its praise is deserved. The mystery of what happened to Harriet Vagner is one of the key segments of the book, and that mystery kept me on edge. There's a locked room theme, (locked island here) Harriet disapears off an island on a day when the bridge was closed and her body was never found. What, in the name of french toast, happened to her??<br /><br />...But that's only part of the story. The other part deals with Blomvkist, an investigative journalist, and his battle with Wenstrom, a corrupt industry leader. If he solves Harriet's murder, he's promised a scoop that will sink the ship that is the destructive Wenstrom forever. Only probelm is, the Harriet case is not so easy to solve.<br /><br />So, part mystery, part commentary on financial systems, and part thriller, with a cast of shifty characters on an island, all under intense suspicion for murdering Harriet. (Who is, by the way, a member of their sad, disagreable family.)<br /><br />What drew me in most was the mystery of Harriet. Also, the character Salander(the girl with the dragon tattoo). Suffering from some type of Asberger's, the highly antisocial hacker is an interesting character. Blomvkist, journalist, and investigator into the Harriet affair,is a bit of a womanizer in a way, but overall he seems an honest guy. The whole set up reminds me of a strange 21st century version of Sherlock Holmes(Salander), with assistant Watson(Blomvkist)<br /><br />The book, at about 500 pages, is long, but doesn't drag. Afterall, remember that there are two plots going on here. I'm very bad at following plot twists so I was thrown a curve ball in the later section dealing with the mystery that I didn't expect.<br /><br />Some people cricize this book as being boring, but I had a hard time putting it down. The writing's pretty straightforward, unglamorous. There's no flair for descriptions that take your breath away...but I don't care. The heart of the story is good...interesting.<br /><br />For once the critics were right, and some of the critics of the critcs just can't appreciate a good mystery.I didn't expect.

B005I64U5C|5.0|The writers did their very best to stay true to the Comic book series of the Green Lantern. It was extreamly well done and the Acting was outstanding. Nothing like the \\"GREEN HORNET\\" which was sorely disappointing in both story and acting. This movie tells the story of the Green Lantern's beginnings and how he came to be and how he saved Earth & the Gallaxy from an evil mennace. The story will catch you up, and not let you go till the very end. I might also add that they left it wide open to a sequeal and if they can get all the original cast back for it, I would look forward to seeing that. I highly recommend this move.[[ASIN:1401221637 The Green Lantern Chronicles Vol. 1]].  RICK BURK

B005IZLPME|5.0|The last in a series of movies based on Marvels Comic book Heros (The Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, & Captain America) which will all be joined together next year in a new movie \\"THE AVENGERS\\". Although this was the last movie in the series, it tells the story of the very first Avenger, Captairn America, who with his intrepid group of soldiers led the fight against a secret organization led by RED SKULL durring WW2. It also tells you how Captain America survived to be transported into the future to join up with The Hulk, Iron Man, & Thor led by their leader Nick Fury, played by Samuel Jackson who was in the ending of every one of the movies (you need to watch the credits of each one to see him). Stan Lee and Marvel have been working up towards this for several years and I myself am extreamly anxious to see the new movie \\"THE AVENGERS\\" next year. They are bringing back all the original cast for each part with exception of The Hulk who this time will be played by Mark Ruflo, after Edward Norton had a spat with Marvel over the 2nd Hulk movie. Norton endorsed and encouraged Mark to do the part as they are old friends. The original part was played by Eric Bana. I highly recommend this movie, and strongly suggest that you get all of the series so that you will be ready for the new movie next year.

As a director who stages children's stories, finding the right adaptation is essential - as the good stories have many. Glynn Robbin's adaptation is fun, has great dialogue and preserves the integrity of the story. It can be simply staged and is emminently appealing to a family audience.   I thoroughly recommend it!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I adore Florence and the Machine! Much to my surprise, I am way more captivated by this albumn than I thought I would be.I love a few songs from her albumn Lungs but Ceremonials really takes it a step futher. It is so beautiful and passionate. Florence's voice is stunning and each song is so unique, yet meaningful. I truly enjoy listening to each and every song on the albumn. That's all there really is to say about Ceremonials because as the great Oscar Wilde once said \\"Beauty is a form of genius,indeed it is higher than genius as it needs no explanation\\".
0142429414|5.0|I throughly enjoy John Grisham and I have most of his works,this however was delightful to read and altho for MUCH younger readers I enjoyed it  immensley(sp)  As I read I Could not help but wonder if this was how he was as a young person.That aside, John Grisom remains my favorite author.  I do quite a bit of shopping w/Amazon as I did w/this Audio Book and will continue to do so.  If I have a complaint or problem  (few and far between)they are handled professionally ,quickly and ALWAYS w/curstesy
B00479SVBU|5.0|What others have said is true. It's the best sound you can get from a FM transmitter. It's nearly flawless. It will take about a day to find the \\"perfect\\" station to use, but once you've got it dialed in, you are set. Much cheaper than putting a whole new stereo in your car, and even then you won't be able to use digital media. The sound quality is really good and once you tweak it with the EQ it's even better. I haven't yet used my mp3 player with the unit, I've just been using SD cards and flash drives and it works great. Definitely worth the money! I researched these products for about 6 weeks before settling on this one.
B000W91RUG|5.0|It was shipped extremely fast, and sent in the condition that was posted. I would definitely buy from you again. Thank You!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I always enjoy a flood game of solitaire and therefore enjoy this version on my kindle fire.  But I did find that when I tried to use it while having my car serviced it was unable to give me any type of game except random and every random game was a losing game. Obviously it needs the Internet to do so. other then that I am pleased with this game on my kindle fire.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Got this app for my Fire and it releases the power of the Fire!! I played with it for a  bit test driving the features and after a bit of adjusting to how it works without a mouse and a keyboard; I could access pretty much everything on my computer.   I can't go five starts because of the learning curve for the mouse, but it is a have to have app if you need access to the stuff on your PC or laptop.
B0053FP1PQ|3.0|The third Kooks album is showing the signs of slippage. The debut flew in with the flock that included buzz bands like Arctic Monkeys, Kaiser Cheifs and others with a smart and punchy rock album in the classic sense of The Kinks or even Oasis. The second album, \\"Konk,\\" played up The Kinks connection even more, with punchier songs and snappy lyrics. I was really hoping for continued progression with \\"Junk of The Heart,\\" however, the songs are retracting their claws.<br /><br />\\"Junk Of The Heart\\" is a softer, sweeter Kooks. The songs are breezier and weirdly inoffensive, given song titles like \\"Eff The World Off\\" or \\"No More Mr Nice Guy.\\" Now, both the title track/lead single and the clever \\"Eskimo Kiss\\" maintain that Kinksian air about them, while the strings that saturate \\"Time Above The Earth\\" are a first for the band, just before leading into the Police-influenced \\"Runaway.\\" The rest of the songs often feel unfinished or weightless. Lead singer Luke Prichard still has appeal, and I am hoping \\"Junk of The Heart\\" is just a blip.
B004AHW8MW|5.0|Such a great story, and a refreshing relief from Hollywood-style stuff and its biggest, baddest blah blah. Has elements of mystery, thriller, and political drama. It's also great to have a protagonist like Lisbeth who's unlike anyone you've ever met and is completely compelling. I could not put it down.
082300659X|5.0|This book does extremely well in providing a thorough overview of the underlying principles of drawing.  It progresses logically, is easy to understand, and is well illustrated with examples that make the concepts clear.  You will find yourself immediately able to apply the ideas to your own drawings.  Where this book really stands out is in the area of structure- that is to say, the \\"how to\\" when it comes to laying down the foundations of good proportions, values, etc., in the beginning stages of your drawing, so that in the later stages your foundation is solid.  This is very helpful for those of us mere mortals who struggle with things like getting size and value relationships correct.  I have many drawing books in my collection, but I find this one to be arguably the best when it comes to structure.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The blu ray case comes in a cardboard slipcase, really nice, with metallic effect and some glowing parts (such as the eye).   I would recommend that you choose to package it in a box, as the slipcover came with \\"traces of travel\\". I mean that the package suffers some bump in plane (it was an international shipment).  The movie, i don't think it needs too much description, you can either view it as an incredibly original and catching movie, or as a new acted version of of Disney's Pocahontas.  Anyway, the movie is reaclly good, and if you've got a 3D compatible TV, i would totally recomment that you get the 3D version.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|As soon as I heard a song by Halestorm, i searched on amazon, and (after some previews) bought the cd. I totally recommend this band. Their music is mostly hard rock, her voice is amazing, and...well, that's pretty much what i like! The lyrics are also good, but I had no chance to pay real attention to them yet, so I can't talk about that.  I'd say: buy it!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This movie is sooooo good... I couldn't wait to get it, and I'm so happy I did!  Now I can have HP marathons whenever I want!!!!
B00008J2PG|5.0|What's really great about this movie is that it's multi-faceted.  First of all, it's based on a true story.  Msgr. Hugh O'Flaherty is a real person and yes, he did stare down the dreaded SS.  His compassion for the Italian people and his conviction that his personal danger was immaterial to the task at hand is uplifting!  A lesson in personal courage and belief in moral values, if ever I saw one.  Also, that the Msgrs. part was played by one of Hollywoods most iconic leading men didn't hurt either!  Gregory Peck is, was and will always be an actor whose pictures stand apart and above other lesser mortals.  A true measure of an actors' skill is immersion in a part so that the viewer actually believes he/she is seeing the person being portrayed, not someone acting a part!  Peck makes you believe it, every time!  Lastly, the fact that the good Msgr. was an Irishman didn't hurt either!  Dealing with the Black & Tans must have made standing up to the SS a natural and necessary obligation.  Truly good movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0525423656|2.0|If you loved Twilight with Bella's sappy, ridiculous longing for a guy, you'll like this. Kinda hoped Cassia would fall off of a cliff by the end of this book.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|I like the product. I don't like the way the discs are packaged for protection against scratching. Shipment time was great. Would recommend for the price.
1932100660|5.0|Since my early days as a nurse caring for cancer victims I have been on a quest to keep myself and family healthy to minimize our chances of suffering from such a ravaging disease. The China Study has cleared up many misconception I had on diet and nutrition, partly born from  misinformation and manipulated studies in publications and many news stations. Everyone should read this book if you care about your health or at least watch \\"Forks over Knives\\" which is an abbreviation of what's in this book.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I loved this when I was 15. I still adore the book three decades later. Timeless romance with people we still fall in love with today, as well as characters who make us want to pull our hair out. The writing style may be a bit intense for those who have grown to short, one and two sentence paragraphs and action that rushes at you, but if you enjoy savouring words and characters and moments, it is magnificent.
B004LAIU4I|2.0|Sorry gang, another poor Paul Simon album. He hasn't had a good one since Rhythm of the Saints. That's 21 years ago. Simon is my all-time favorite songwriter/musician. So it pains me to write this bad review. And I didn't even purchase the album. So how do I know? Because my wife and I saw him in Minneapolis last May, and he played all or most of his new songs off this album. The contrast in quality between these mediocre at best new songs and his great old songs was stark. I did buy his two previous albums that were so bad and below Simon's earlier works that I couldn't believe it. I didn't buy Songs From The Capeman for ethical reasons concerning Simon trying to feel sorry for the fate of a cold-blooded killer. The few songs I did hear off the Capeman were awful. So I'll save myself twelve bucks or so and remember the old Paul Simon, the best songwriter of his generation who ran out of good material twenty years ago. I give this album two stars because I can't stand the idea of giving Paul Simon the one star it deserves. I give him the extra star only because of what his music meant to me and still means to me.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I accept that it is one of the great books of all time but I find it too dark, too depressing, too bleak... I cannot rejoice in a love that is so destructive that it cares not for what happens to those around it, it merely obsesses about its own gain. Yes, beautifully written and constructed and I've had to read it a couple of times for various studies over the years, but I find life has enough problems so I turn to romance novels for a feeling of warmth and a brief feeling that somewhere love could be beautiful, not something you get from Wuthering Heights. The hopelessness of so many of the characters makes me uneasy and I'm left feeling as though those cold winds from those hills are blowing through me.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Used to be an okay app, but since the most recent update, this app is way too big. Uninstalled until this is fixed.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|great for everything, notes, clipping, web receipts...etc... it has great search tool... option for different notebooks, you can also choose to set some notebooks to sync, and others set as local notebooks.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|We just purchased a [[ASIN:B004MN79A0 Samsung PN59D7000]] and we wanted to hook it up to our [[ASIN:B000FHA7E2 Yamaha RX-497 Receiver]].  We are so happy that this product is available because it's the cheapest solution to getting sounds through the loudspeakers.  There are other products similar to this, but I don't know if they are as simple to use - they're definitely not as cheap.  We also purchased an [[ASIN:B001TH7GSW AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable]], which we plugged into the \\"Digital Audio Out (Optical)\\" port on the TV and the other end into the \\"Optical In\\" on the FiiO D3.  We have an extra red-white-yellow cable, so we're using the red and white plugs to connect from the FiiO to the receiver.  We plugged in the power, turned the receiver to the proper channel and there was only noise, so we changed the audio format on the TV from Digital Dolby to PCM, and that was it!  If you recently purchased a new TV with only an optical out, and you don't want to spend at least another $200 on a new receiver for an optical in, you can buy this and an optical audio cable; you'll be as happy as we are about this little black box.
B005SJIP2S|4.0|Along with FLY FROM HERE, it strikes me that YES is doing what it can to move forward. I have not watched the DVD of this package, so I can't comment on the visuals. What I can say is that this is the first recording in a very long time where the band seemed as though it had a point. They play with a commitment I haven't heard from them in years, and sound actually quite liberated to be free of Anderson. Squire shines and there are no longer any Unamazing Grace segments to suffer through. It's the tunes and only the tunes, and they take them on with a sense of urgency. My ears didn't hear this as plodding. Instead, they sound like they are actually playing as a band not by rote. Squire and White lock in solidly as does Oliver Wakeman, who seems less flash than his father, more involved than Tony Kaye. Howe sounds reinvigorated. It's as though he's returned from the land of the living dead with a new lease on guitar life and he plays his damn hands off. Can't say for certian, but the band here sounds like it is in the hands of Howe and White. No surprise given Howe's generally terrific solo records and trio outings and White's gobsmacking performance on White, Torn, Levin. As for David, he does sound a lot more like Anderson on this than he does on FLY, but less raspy. It was time. That the band would go back and cover Everydays and Astral Traveller underscores the decision to rewrite the history a bit with a new vocalist. David isn't the creative contributor Anderson was and with Geoff Downes now back in the fold, doesn't need to be. FLY was the least YES sounding record in a long time. No artsy fartsy lyrics and staright ahead strong instrumental performances. Not an easy task to reinvent oneself when one has a storied history, and perhaps the point of this release was to put a period on the last statement of ahighly regarded repertoire so that FLY and whatever else may follow can be possible. I should check out the video, but for the moment, this is one of my personal favourites among the YES live performances. Are there warts? Yes. But hadn't we had enough of the sonic airbrushing they'd indulged in? What mistakes they make (and I should make such mistakes) add lustre to the determined effort to be a band with a pulse, still relevant, still creative. And it does sound like they intend to fly from here.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It is true, if you want just the movies you can buy the first three, and the second three separately for cheaper (about $80). But with those you only get the movies and some audio commentaries (2 per video).  So if you just want the movies, do that, buy them separately, the come in nice boxes too.  However, for a true, avid StarWars fan, you need the three extra disks of bonus features.    I previously owned the full set DVD edition of these with all the bonus features, and I can honestly say that I watched every last one.  Time consuming? yes.  Informative? yes.  Eye opening and meaningful?  yes.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I've been a fan of the Black Keys since I got Thickfreakness and Rubber Factory off a friend ten years ago. I love the old tracks from these albums and the Big Come Up but am thoroughly enjoying this album. I get why fans aren't thrilled with this effort but it ticks all the boxes for me.
1451648537|5.0|Purchased this book as a gift. Person was well pleased with the time and condition of service and the content.
B006JIVRYA|5.0|I can't believe the twist towards the end of this episode. Amazing. This writer is great!! Finding about what happened to Larry. Violet!!! I did not see that coming. I love being able to catch up on these episodes online since I dont have FX on my cable.
