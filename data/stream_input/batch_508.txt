B000002KE2|5.0|I agree with most of what the other reviewers have stated.  There is a reason why they have rated this album so highly---it simply rocks in a major way. <br /> <br />Yes, Sabbath was starting to experiment.  The rock is more progressive, punkish, and acid than Master of Reality.  However, this works in a major way.  It was not detrimental in the least. <br /> <br />This is a different album than Master of Reality.  Sabbath decided to take their composition in a new direction---and I can't blame them.  It gets boring to do the same thing all the time.  It's just as heavy as Master of Reality, but there are some songs included that great a greater contrast to the sludging riffs.  Also, the heavy songs seem to have been mixed more along the treble range, which makes the riffs sound almost Nirvana-ish.  Seriously, Kurt Cobain listed this album as one of his influences.  (I read that in a magazine article/interview.  Look it up, I'm not making it up).  <br /> <br />\\"Wheels of Confusion\\", \\"Supernaut\\", \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Cornucopia\\", and \\"Under the Sun/Everything Comes and Goes\\" are EXCELLENT heavy metal songs.  I would buy this album just to have \\"Snowblind\\" and \\"Under the Sun\\".  They are heavy, dark, and foreboding; the pain of drug abuse and the rebellion of youth are all amply evoked. <br /> <br />For the time and era, this is one of the best.  Every rocker needs to have this album in his/her collection.
B0009353IW|2.0|I feel as though the artists who contributed on this cd meant well enough, but there's just something wrong here. Most of it seems like an instrumental cd with singing parts tacked on afterward. Maybe they went into the studio, and came up with some really great and infectous grooves. Then they hung this \\"concept\\" on it. Maybe they had the concept first. <br /> <br />Whichever came first, it slowly becomes obvious that Ry Cooder is not a conceptual creative genius on the level of say, Roger Waters of Pink Floyd. Alot of it just doesn't seem to fit togehter. <br /> <br />Take for example, El U.F.O. Cayo.... <br /> <br />Here you have probably one of the greatest ambient tracks produced in 10 or 15 years, fantastic sample loops, moody guitar, Juliette Commagere's voice reminicient of Wanda de Sah, and then in the middle of the song is this old guy doing a recitation... in Spanish! <br /> <br />What the....! <br /> <br />It's a song you really want to listen to over and over, but you keep tripping over this old guy with a raspy voice who then speaks for two minutes through a soundhorn. It's out of context with the rest. Maybe that's the \\"artistic\\" point here, I don't know. To me, it's just irritating. <br /> <br />The next track, It's Just Work For Me, again... a great groove, but Ry just rambles on and on with his character rant. I would've liked to hear Ry noodle on his guitar some more. <br /> <br />Alot of this cd gets bogged down by the \\"concept\\". Forcing you to deal with it. Again, maybe this is an bold and militant artistic maneuver, but after one or two listens, it gets annoying. <br /> <br />I honestly think that when it came to adding vocals/lyrics they just went with the first thing they came up with, as if there was no constructive criticism... really thinking through how to combine the two seamlessly, in a clever way. <br /> <br />If this is all they could creatively come up with, I think the story should have been seperated from the music and left in thebooklet, or maybe have the music be the background for a documentary film about the injustices of Chavez Ravine.
0767830555|5.0|Martin Scorsese grew up in New York. He loves the city, and knows it well. In Taxi Driver, one of his first large successes, he drew a hauntingly poetic image of its dark underbelly. The main character, Travis Bickle, is a disenfranchised Vietnam veteran that can't sleep. So he starts driving taxis. He tells that audience that every morning when he returns the cab, he has to wipe the cum off the seats. Sometimes, he also has to wipe off blood. <br /> <br />This is the setup for the movie, which is not so much about plot as Bickel's slow descent into madness. Some of the plot points that lead to the movie's violent, anarchic ending: Bickle falls for a beautiful young woman working for a politician's election campaign, he meets a twelve year old prostitue and her pimp, and he is disgusted by the city's scum, which is developed by his meeting with the pimp. <br /> <br />But more interesting than any of those things is Bickle, and his inner troubles. He hates himself for being socially inept, evidenced by his date with the beautiful woman, in which he takes her to a porno theater, and she runs away from him. Later, for reasons that are only apparent if you see the movie, Bickle buys guns and practices drawing them in front of a mirror. He then gives the famous \\"You talkin' to me?\\" speech.  <br /> <br />Now, to the ending. Many people have different theories as to whethet or not he really died. In my opinion, it is irrelevant what happens to him. The whole movie has an aura of dreaminess. And the final shot, of Bickle looking in the mirror and seeing no reflection, is less an example of proving he isn't alive than a simple, haunting shot. Scorsese should have won the Oscar for Taxi Driver.
B00031TXBI|5.0|In another review immediately following the release of Curtains, John's final album in his string of releases, I put his albums in order and listed this as second, right after Ataxia's Automatic Writing. I'd like to reverse my prior decision, and place Inside of Emptiness as my favorite.<br /><br />I've listened to this album over and over and over again since my last review, and this album blows me away from beginning to end, and from front to back.<br /><br />My favorite songs If I had to pick, my favorite songs would be:<br /><br />What I Saw: Great opening songs. John has excellent vocal range here.<br /><br />Look On: Awesome song. I love how John's voice breaks slightly at the end of each verse before singing, \\"Look on, Look on, Look on.\\" The solo is great too.<br /><br />Interior Two: Could be my favorite. This has a 50's style twang to it. John's voice gets really high, and just makes your want to sing along.<br /><br />Scratches: Words cannot explain how tremendous this song is. Absolute perfection all the way around. The first 2 minutes are rather slow with John's voice being the most predominant. Then his guitar starts doing the singing too. Of the six albums he put out, this song has to be the best.<br /><br />So in conclusion I'd recommend really sitting down and listening to this album, cause it will blow your mind.
0393035158|5.0|This is more a commentary on all the reviews. <br />THere are 280+ posted for this book. <br />They fall in three or four basic categories and a few that don't fit. <br />1. The basic Atheist that loved the book. <br />2. The religious who scorn the book (as could be predicted they attack the author not the content) <br />3. The atheist who thinks they could have done a better job or feel that Harris did a lousy job (often they point us to another \\"better\\" book on the subject. <br />4. The doubtful religious person who sees the value of the book. <br /> <br />The best review was by a pentacostal (spelling?) minister who is having serious doubts. <br /> <br />For all it's flaws, this is a truly important book.  It could save our lives (or our childrens childrens childrens lives).
B0000DD7LC|3.0|Alicia Keys became a household name after the debut of her first album, Songs in A Minor.  Her second cd, The Diary of Alicia Keys, came with much anticipation.  Unfortunatly, it didnt live up to the hype that fans had made.  This cd is a solid neo-soul album, however, when compared to her first cd, it falls short of expectations.   <br />The cd starts out with the song Karma, a solid start and radio hit.  One of the best on album.  It moves right along at a nice pace, with good, solid songs and catchy beats until song nine.  After that, the quality slips to ok songs that are very forgettable.  It often seems with longer cd's like this one that the quality of the first songs cannot carry throughout the album.  The diary of Alicia keys follows that pattern to a tee.     <br />This cd is a pretty good follow up album, very similar to the first in style.  I would have liked to hear somthing a little bit more adventurous, maybe some gospel even, but her formula still puts out nice, catchy songs and see has talent enough to carry it off.  It is definatly not a waste of money, however, I wouldn't expect it to be on the charts for long.
B00004SC3M|3.0|We are introduced early in this movie to someone whole steals a valuable Rembrandt Van Rijn painting.  We do not see this person because the person is wearing a mask.  Insurance investigator Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) tells her boss that she thinks Robert \\"Mac\\" MacDougal (Sean Connery) stole the painting.  Her boss tells her that she has blamed MacDougal for half the thefts committed for a period of time I no longer recall.  The beginning of this movie sounds very similar to \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\"  Fear not, this movie has more twists than that movie, to which is bears only a few similarities.  This movie is much more like \\"It Takes a Thief,\\" though you may not realize how much until you reach the end.<br /><br />Baker begins following Mac around, ostensibly to find some clue as to where the Rembrandt painting might be.  However, we soon learn that Baker has something much bigger in mind.  Things become even more interesting when Baker reveals to Mac that she stole the Rembrandt, and she used a clever, non-obvious way of getting the painting out of the building.  Soon we learn that there is even more to the theft of the Rembrandt.  I know I was surprised.<br /><br />What happens next is a sort of competition, where we see Baker and Mac continuing to try to outdo each other.  If you are not paying attention it is easy to get lost in who is doing what and when they are doing it; thus the advantage of DVDs where you can keep stepping back a chapter or so to try and digest the complexity of this movie.  Eventually the plot reveals that Baker has a plan to steal a huge (billions) sum of money by breaking into a computer.  The plan involves very fine timing that has to coincide with the millennium (of course, otherwise there would be no sense of urgency).<br /><br />Once things get set into motion the movie moves forward briskly.  There is getting into the building, the timing of breaking into the computer, and the nasty mistake that sends dozens of people chasing after them.  It is all good fun up until someone gets caught.<br /><br />This movie tends to get polarized reviews.  I think mostly it is about your expectations.  If you like Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and try to avoid analyzing action movies very much, then you would probably like this movie.  On the other hand, if you do not care for either actor, or you spend too much time realizing that there are a number of continuity problems and implausibilities sprinkled throughout the movie, you will likely be too focused on those and disappointed that the director was hoping you would like his cleverness in spite of the fact that much of the plot was impossible.<br /><br />In balance, I should note that Christopher Young received a BMI Film Music Award in 2000 for this movie.  Catherine Zeta-Jones won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actress - Action.  Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery won European Film Awards Audience Awards for Best Actress and Best Actor.  In addition, Ving Rhames was nominated for the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor - Action, and the Motion Picture Sound Editors of USA nominated the movie for a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing for a Foreign Feature.  To keep things in perspective, Catherine Zeta-Jones was also nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Actress and Zeta-Jones and Connery were nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Couple.<br /><br />As for me, once I realized that the movie had too many implausible situations, I just enjoyed the plot and tried to figure out what was what.  I also must point out that I have liked Connery in nearly every movie he has starred in.  He has a lot of charisma.  I also like Zeta-Jones, though she has much less talent than Connery.<br /><br />I must admit that the ending puzzles me just a little.  It seems to me that there came a point where the director made something happen, and ignored the trivial problem that what he did was impossible.  I think he was hoping that people would like the end of the movie so much that they would not notice the problem.  Unfortunately, nearly everyone noticed.  Fortunately for the director, many people did not care.the end of the movie so much that they would not notice the problem.  Unfortunately, nearly everyone noticed.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This cd is great if you are just getting into the Beatles.  It covers all of their 27 number one hits, in order.  <br /> <br /> It starts out with the early stuff, love me do, Ticket to Ride, Eight Days a week, ect.  These songs are great, upbeat songs that remind us how great it is to be young.  it moves on to the era of Paperback Writer, Elanor Rigby, and the Ballad of John and Yoko. These to are great, a little darker and more mature, but great. <br /> <br />This cd is a good rep. of Beatles music.  If you dont want to buy five cds, or you aren't really sure if you like the Beatles or not, gt this cd.  Its a great intro to the wonderful career of this legendary music icons.  And I promise that after listening to this cd a few times, you'll grow to love it as much as I do!!
B00008G9JO|4.0|I have enjoyed most Tull albums nearly from the first listening.  I have even enjoyed the albums that many other Tull fans did not appreciate; e.g., \\"Too Old to Rock `N' Roll - Too Young to Die.\\"  Thus my surprise when I initially struggled to enjoy this album.  However, after hearing this album multiple times I have come to enjoy the rather unique Tull music on this album.  There are still a couple of moments on this album that I find weird, but the earthy rural theme is enjoyable.  The words are genuinely descriptive of the changing rural life in Great Britain, but also to some extent the United States and the other countries of the world where farming continues to become more standardized, mechanized and computerized.<br /><br />The first song I enjoy all the way to the end.  The last 30 seconds I continue to find annoying, even after listening to this song more than a dozen times.  The vocals I find annoying.  The song itself is about the age-old battle between the farm cat and the legions of mice that exist on any farm.  Of course the cat has little to fear from the mice, but the mice must always be on their guard; \\"...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps.\\"  I suspect that the end vocals are meant to somehow communicate the urgency and anxiety the mice must feel everyday, never knowing when the pounce will come.<br /><br />The second song is about visiting the wild places of Scotland and her islands.  \\"Acres Wild\\" contains sensual references that indicate becoming close to nature in a very personal way.  The flute, mandolin and fiddle lend a very Celtic flavor to this folk-flavored song.  This song is an excellent song that helps to place this album in the folk-rock category.<br /><br />The next song starts as rock.  The topic is how scary it is to be a child in your bed at night, with monsters at the door and no light to comfort you.  The noises in the country at night are often fearsome because so many are unrecognizable.  The music accompanying the poetic lyrics is enjoyable and excellent.<br /><br />\\"Moths\\" is a love song disguised as moths attracted to a deadly candle flame.  This lovely song is more folk than rock and contains sufficient poetry to keep you analyzing the words longer than I have patience.  \\"Journeyman\\" follows the travel of a commuter to the country, though this song could readily apply to thousands in their suburban or rural flight in countries everywhere.<br /><br />The song \\"Rover\\" seems to be a tale of obedient love, or someone who is so head over heels in love that they are lost in the love.  I like the beginning of this song with its renaissance folk music flavor.  This song is highly original and a standout song on this CD.  The song \\"One Brown Mouse\\" keeps the style of the previous song, though this time the song seems more straightforward.  The song could be an allegory for love.  The pipe organ in this song is an unusual addition that makes this song unique and lovely.<br /><br />Finally comes the epic title track.  This nearly nine minute long song laments the change in agriculture from the use of the great horses, Suffolk, Percheron, Clydesdale and Shire, to tractors.  The lament for the loss of these great horses is heartfelt and powerful, and strongly poetic with Ian Anderson's lyrics.  The music is similarly powerful, with deep bass to describe these huge horses.  The flavor is often folk, but there is sufficient rock power to be the theme of the horses.  This song is one of the best on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Weathercock\\" was the original end of this CD.  The style begins as folk, and the words are hopeful.  About one minute before the end of the song the power kicks up as electric guitars carry the song to its conclusion.<br /><br />The remastered version adds two bonus tracks, \\"Living in These Hard Times\\" and \\"Broadford Bazaar.\\"  Even better, the cover booklet includes the lyrics for both songs.  The first song includes references to politicians and unions and how there is nothing left over.  The folk style remains consistent with the original songs.  The last song is wonderfully anachronistic.  The style sounds like a renaissance song, though the words include references to motor cars and oil rigs that no longer exist.<br /><br />The new final song is wonderful and puts a different flavor on the CD than the original ending.  This song is more melancholy and pessimistic than the original, and while in some ways the world is better now than when this album was originally released in 1978, in other ways it is worse.  Certainly there are new concerns about the environment and some concerns about the general quality of life.<br /><br />After Jethro Tull's commercial success in the mid-1970s, some of us began wondering whether Tull had lost that which made them unique.  However, the group came roaring back with the somewhat whimsical \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and this album with its earthy and significantly more pragmatic topics.  The music also returned to the unique style that made Tull enjoyable to those of us tired of cookie cutter rock.  There are a number of moments on this album that keep it just short of a five star rating, but a four star Tull album is better than most of the rock you'll find from that era, and as good as much of the rock from this one.The last song is wonderfully anachronistic.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay took a long time to get this cd just right.  Fortunatly, their idea of right is also the fans.  This cd is great, very mellow and polished, typical of a seasoned band like Coldplay.   <br />THe cd starts off strong with Square One, which helps to set the tone of the cd.  Moving right along if What If, a very slow piece, heavy on piano and tender vocals.  White Shadows is one of my favorites on the cd, a very solid, radio friendly sound.  The cd moves right along until it gets to seven, Speed of Sound.  Its a new VH1, radio and MTV staple but is still a great song, one that can be played over and over.  It is probably the fastest song on the album.  The cd closes with a melancholy, guitar driven song that is a nice finishing touch to the cd. <br />Coldplay has proven that their huge sucuess is because of their huge talent.  Their poetic lyrics and wonderful melodic songs will be a favorite in your collection, on my honor.
B000929AJQ|3.0|It's been five and a half years since the unfairly maligned 'The Fragile', which I can honestly say basically changed my direction of musical taste permanently. Reznor has been known to make ground-breaking music with honest emotion, and so now comes to his latest, 'With Teeth'. Unlike any other release it doesn't break nearly as much ground and is the simplest thing made since 'pretty hate machine' and 'broken', but even that broke new ground.  <br /> <br />The new NIN record has both its highlights and lowlights. It does have a great one-two punch on the low-key, trip-hop influenced \\"All the Love in the World\\", which shows Trent doing everything he does the best. It's got a great falsetto and piano solo to boot with that. Then comes in Dave Grohl's machine-like drum delivery in \\"You Know What You Are\\", along with a cool sound that reminds me of drum-n-bass that comes before the verses. Although this shows that Trent has kind of reverted from 'The Fragile' and is less mature that is fine enough in this case.  <br />Other highlights here include the almost Dandy Warhols-sounding \\"Sunspots\\", although that's only in the riffs becuase Reznor's voice kind of splits a difference and he hasn't gotten done saying \\"nothing can stop me now\\". \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is straight-out synth stuff from NIN, and gets stuck in your head for awhile. \\"With Teeth\\" is a great song that had to do with overcoming his battle with alcohol and heroin, with nice instrumentation. It's one of the more memorable NIN moments. It also gets real nice in its conclusion of \\"Right Where It Belongs\\", with great lines like \\"What if everything you know is just an elaborate dream?\\". It's a nice piano track and shows that Reznor is still skilled at that thing and it doesn't shy away the Bowie-type stuff he's been doing since 'The Downward Spiral'.  <br />I suppose if you want an album with the 'hits', this is a good place to start. There are catchy numbers like \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", the nice riffage of\\"Getting Smaller\\" and \\"The Collector\\" is one of the most accessible NIN tracks.  <br />This album does have its flaws. There are some real lyrical missteps. Look at \\"Only\\": \\"I just pick you up/to hurt myself/there's no f**king you/there is only me\\". This shows that Reznor's maturity seems to have reverted from the last time and the lyrics on 'The Fragile' were great. The remainder songs don't really stand out much.  <br /> <br />I actually think this is a really good record, but the more I like an artist, the more constructively critical I get with the artist. I believe NIN are best when creating ground-breaking opuses, and this doesn't sound anything like that. As much as I hate saying it, it's easily the most commerical thing NIN has ever done. I guess that's what is dissapointing is that that's not what some would wait five-and-a-half years for. At any rate though I am really interested in what he does and I hope it sounds more on-target for someone who has already approched 40. Either way I hope he has more ambition and ideas for the next release, but at least this is decent.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This is the funniest movie I have ever seen...along with Ring 2, but that's beside the point.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|First I have to apologize for my english which is not so good. I'm now obsessed with this movie.  I need to listen the sound track of this movie everyday. Gerard Butler is excellent as phantom.  I used to see the broadway several years ago (but not the one with Brightman and Crawford), however, I love both stage musical and the movie.  Both of them are fantastic.  If you watch this movie with un-bias heart, you'll love it. The first time I saw this movie in the theater, I feel unsure that I like it or not because I compare it to the stage show.  After I saw it for the second time, I start to love it very mcuh, so I have to see the third, fourth and so on. Now I addicted to the music as well as Gerard Butler.  I went to the VDO shop and rent every movie having GB starring in them.  I thank Joel and ALW very very much to produce such a great movie for us and for the world.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend introduced me to Firefly more than two years after it was cancelled.  I enjoyed the wit and comradery of the crew so much that I bought this boxed set soon thereafter.  It is a well-written series full of adventure, intrigue and believable characters you can't help but like.  At this price, you can afford to buy it sight-unseen.  I can't wait for the movie which is due out this September (2005).
6305903182|4.0|Decent plot, good characters, good directing.  The identity of the killer keeps you guessing up to the end, just like the first two movies.  Plenty of inside jokes about the movie industry, some of which I got, and many others I'm sure I missed.  Ordinarily I'm not a fan of movies about movies, but when it's a send-up, I suppose I can relax the rules a bit.  Carrie Fisher in her cameo was hysterical.  I was happy to see that they brought Jamie Kennedy back for the finale--I thought he was the most entertaining character from the first two movies.  Wes was a little enigmatic with his final closing shot, seeming to say that he's still open to making a fourth film.  That could happen, but frankly, I think Wes said what needed to be said in the trilogy.  No need to serialize it any further, and if he tried, I don't think it would make him a buck.  Worth the price of a rental, or if you are a fan of the genre, a purchase.
B00005B364|4.0|This 1971 recording opens with the explosive Hocus Pocus (6'42\\"), which features yodeling, whistling, crazed laughing, and silly vocalese parts along with the searing 200-mph guitar work of virtuoso Jan Akkerman.  In a jarring and abrupt change, the tempo shudders to a grinding halt and the mood shifts from the opening madness to the dreamy classical guitar and mellotron of the 2'01\\" Le Clochard.  This reflective mood is maintained through Janis (3'09\\"), which features some very nice flute parts, the title track Moving Waves (2\\"42\\"), and the somewhat up-tempo Focus II (4'03\\").  Of the four shorter pieces, only Moving Waves features vocal parts.  The high point of this disc however is the largely instrumental, 15-part Eruption suite, which goes on for about 23 minutes.  This lengthy suite includes brief vocalese sections, unaccompanied guitar and drum solos, very churchy sounding Hammond organ, brooding mellotron parts, and impressive ensemble work.  This is a decent bit of prog from the Netherlands that is certainly worth adding to any collection.
1416503730|5.0|I completely loved this book! I read it all in one day. The mix of romance novel and murder mystery with just the right amount of brain-numbing twists makes this a phenomanal book in this \\"professional\\" opinion.
0394873742|4.0|My child is 21 months old and just adores this book.  The size is great.  I also like that it is a board book, as they can sit on the book and point things out and I'm not worried about it being destroyed like paper pages.  I have seen a lot of improvement in word development since buying it; my child is proud to tell me what things are.  The only very minor thing I didn't like was that some of the pictures are of fictitious things, so they will have to learn later on that there is no such thing as say a \\"pencil car.\\"  But besides that, I am very glad I made this purchase.  I see it having worth for years to come, as my child progresses to actually reading the words on the pages.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Where? 50 surely doesn't know.    Here's a tip for the kids. Work out alot so you can pull your shirt up at odd moments in public, don't go anywhere without your \\"strap\\", piss alot of real rappers off enough to get shot a couple times (earning you massive street-cred) and you've got yourself a genuine 50cent style career.    Rap today is not what you see when you turn on MTV, kids. Look to the perimeter where some young people with real things to say are saying them. Get a Non-Prophets album and you'll see.    By the way, \\"Gatman and Robin\\"???? Whoa Fifty, don't hurt 'em. Inspired.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Writer/Director Kerry Conran created a really fun quasi-40s world where a mad scientist has sent out an army of robots to help advance his plot of detonating a doomsday device. The only one who can save the world is the high-flying adventurer Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), a.k.a. the Sky Captain.<br /><br />Conran seemed to be trying several things in this movie at once. In Sky Captain and his friends -- reporter Polly Perkins (Gwynneth Paltrow), fellow flier Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie) and techie Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), he seemed to be trying to create an old-fashioned combination of a pulp fiction hero and his team of operatives, like everyone from Doc Savage to Indiana Jones. I have a personal fondness for that sort of old-fashioned storytellling, and that's one of the reasons I think it appealed to me so much. The other thing he was doing with this movie was create an entire digital world - most of the acting was done against a green screen, and the backgrounds, robots and effects were all added by computer later. Frankly, there isn't anything groundbreaking about this - George Lucas has been doing the same for years, and at this point I'm willing to give bonus points to any action movie that can make it work without CGI. So while the technique itself isn't really that innovative anymore, Conran's vision was quite effective. The whole film looked like it leapt right off the pages of an old pulp magazine or comic book. It was beautifully rendered and fantastic to behold. I don't know if there are any plans for a sequel, but I'd certainly try to catch it if there were. Overall, I give the movie a B-plus.
B00005GL0S|5.0|This is one of the Beatles best albums. Theres no reason to review this album. It's been reviewed by hundreds/thousands. For those who love this album, you owe it to yourself to try to find the MONO version of it. The tracks are the same, but they sound quite diferent in mono. They are superior to the stereo version. Some like While My Guitar and Helter Skelter are either longer or shorter than the stereo versions, they also have slightly diferent lyrics. You will notice that the times listed for both versions of the same song are slightly diferent on most of all their albums. This is due to the fact that a lot songs by the Beatles are different in the mono and stereo versions. <br /> <br />The overall sound of the mono version is much rawer and powerful. Listen to the Capital box set and you will hear how dramatically different the two versions are. Actually, the mono versions of all the Beatles albums are better than in stereo. The mono mixes were actually preferred by the Beatles over the stereo versions. The stereo mixes were produced by George Martin while their mono counterparts were reportedly done by the Beatles themselves.  <br /> <br />Now that Capital has released the first four albums in mono & stereo hopefully they will release all the rest in the mono/stereo formats. Mono versions of all their albums can be found on ebay. These are LEGAL versions because all their albums (LP format) were released internationally in both formats. The (mono)CDs are bootlegs.

B0000B1OFI|3.0|Even though this movie starts out in Venice, with motorboat chases down the canals following an ultra modern heist of gold bars worth 35 million dollars, most of the action takes place out in California.  There really is not much Italian about this job; even the funky music is pure L.A. -- not easy on the ears or senses.  It is pretty weird with lots of noise but not much taste. <br /> <br />The dialogue isn't much, either.  Seth Green of WITHOUT A PADDLE fame was the best of the bunch, as the computer wiz Napster.  He looks so much like Michael Feinstein, it is a joy to watch his antics.  They use cell phones and computers which I know were not in the original 1969 version starring Michael Caine who was the original 'Alfie.' <br /> <br />The weird looking cars (mini Coopers) red, white and blue were something like the teen races in 'Rebel Without A Cause' and 'Grease.'  They maneuvered down on the Metro underground tracks and through storm drain tunnels to escape the black helicopter after a fashion. <br /> <br />We see the famous junkyard run by the Italians where the garbage men are warned by a 400-lb. Oriental or Ukranian (take your pick).  The first attempt to recover the gold which is left -- 208 bricks worth 27 million had to be aborted because of a neighbor's large party in the gated and guarded grand mansions. <br /> <br />There was nothing poetic about this bunch of international criminals.  The helicopter flew right past the Hollywood hill sign, Hotel Roosevelt, and Chinese Theatre.  The traffic jams caused by a malfunction at the Traffic Control Center showed some buses; #2636 looked like the old white borrowed vehicles KAT has from Worchester, Mass.  The mini cars are driven into a cattle car attached to the Union Pacific train and off they go into the wild blue yonder. <br /> <br />It could have been a western except for the Big Brother cameras out on the freeway.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|This is a solid album, perhaps not quite as good as Discovery and Homework. The title track has one of the most infectious guitar riffs I've ever heard, and burns itself into your brain even more than the vocals in \\"Around the World.\\" Same goes for \\"Robot Rock.\\" I will agree with the other reviewers who say that \\"Steam Machine\\" and \\"Brainwasher\\" are a bit weak, though.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Excellent cinematography, superb acting, and a story that is engrossing, believable, and touching. Incredibly moving- I laughed and cried... bittersweet and honest. A must-see. One of my all-time favorites.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is one of the best films of 03? You have GOT to be kidding me. I forced myself to watch this movie all the way to the finish in hopes that somewhere along the way, a PLOT of some sort would become discernible. No such luck though, before I knew it, the credits were rolling, and with that, another hour and a half of my life down the drain.<br /><br />What a complete waste of time. It's a little love story of two people coming together in a foreign country, but since it has nothing interesting to tell, the movie goes nowhere, and there's no payoff. It reminded me of Garden State (which is still better than this) in the way I felt like I was watching two random people dealing with their little relationship and the movie putting them through their motions. I don't consider it entertainment to sit there and watch two people go on their little dates and smile, flirt, and giggle.<br /><br />Far as I'm concerned, here's the plot summary: two strangers meet, they get to know each other, they do stuff together, then sad, the end.<br /><br />The fact this movie takes place in Tokyo is really of no consequence. Provided that we still have our two main characters in a foreign country, this movie could've easily taken place in any other country and told the exact same story. In other words, the producers didn't bother to use the unique Tokyo environment to their advantage. This movie may be considered slightly above average at best.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Whether you're newly in love, an old married couple, hopelessly single or burned out and bitter, there is a storyline in this all-star ensemble piece that will make you laugh and cry.  Beautifully done film and superior soundtrack with a cheeky commentary track and poignant director's notes.<br /><br />Sure to please, bargain priced and also a great gift idea for anyone on your list!<br /><br />Only problem (and pet peeve) is the unescapable PREVIEW TRACK included...you can't even skip 'em, you have to fast forward through them.  Really obnoxious.  OK if it were a rental, but to stick these on to something you purchase is plain WRONG!
0465011020|4.0|The story of K.Chol-Hwan isn't rare. There's several published accounts of cases such as his, mostly those be from the former Soviet Union. <br /> <br />Besides the obvious fact that this account being from extremely-isolated North Korea has intense interest, his book draws many parallels to the Soviet gulag stories. <br />K.Chol-Hwan's family was basically lured back to N.Korea from Japan where they were leading a very prosperous life, a lure made easier partly because his mother was ideologically a \\"communist\\". Despite the reservations of the rest of the family they relocated to N.Korea where they were supposed to help in the \\"revolution\\" and the \\"development\\" of the country. <br /> <br />Instead, they found themselves in a backwards isolated environment, a personal cult under Kim Jong-il, and a system that may call itself \\"communist\\" but is nothing more than a hardcore dictatorship. Hwan's account relates how slowly but steadily they were forced to give up their wealthy possessions, and how they discovered that the definition of being \\"reactionary\\" is quite open in that country, not only that, but it could land you in some seriously uncomfortable places. <br /> <br />Like for example, one of the countries numerous concentration camps, Yodok.  <br /> <br />Hwan, along with his entire immediate family (!) find themselves incarcerated in that hard-labour camp, where descriptions of appaling conditions abound. Inmates resort to eating bugs, frogs and rats. The sanitary conditions are as close to pure horror as it gets, inmates are punished for the slightest of pretenses, death looms heavy in all kinds of forms, and hope may die last but for most of the incarcerated that doesn't take long either. <br />Daily and downright hilarious but force-fed propaganda is the order of the day, and the inmates find themselves in a micro-world of incredible absurdity, brutality and darkness. <br /> <br />He and his family spent an unbearable 12 years in Yodok, and after that they were miraculously and unexpectedly released. Certainly more miraculous is the fact that they lived at all.  <br /> <br />After a short spell where Hwan tries to lead a \\"normal\\" life in the outside, he desides that wherever efforts he invests are basically pointless considering the increasingly worsening situation in the country, a situation that can at best be described as utterly hopeless for millions of N.Koreans. His plan to escape goes through some obstacles and close calls, but it eventually succeeds, and via China he finds himself in South Korea, N.Korea's \\"hated enemy\\".  <br /> <br />   After a period where he relates his story to the authorities who seek as much information as they could possibly get, he becomes an overnight celebrity of sorts, complete with countless interviews, lectures etc, all of course accompanied by a handsome income that his new-found status creates. <br /> <br />Perhaps predictably, Hwan comes short to declaring this a paradise. There in lays naturally the weakness of the book. While his account before his escape is not exactly a literary masterpiece (dry, colorless, even if intense and emphatic in all its horror and misery) , Hwan's understanding of the world is lobsided to say the least. He captures easily the obvious, dramatic and excruciating  failures of N.Korea but fails equally to capture those in the new system where he's found refuge. <br /> <br /> This in itself is also not rare. It does undermine the book as a whole in my opinion, but not his account of Yodok which must be read if only to discover to what limits humans can display bestiality.

He says, do you always get your your man..She says, oh I hope so!..Inevitably, romance ensues..The plot thickens when Crown tells Vicki, following an intimate moment, he will rob the bank again, because he's gotta know if Vicki will fink him out again, given a second swipe..Norman Jewison, the film's director, found the story of the Thomas Crown Affair in a forgotten stack of manuscripts, and went to see the author..Found the writer to be a novice screenwriter, and a restless Ivy League attorney turned daydreamer, who lived in an apartment with a 180% view of a high payroll Boston bank..Norman Jewison was the ideal director to make this F.

B00007ELEL|5.0|One of the greatest comedies of the 90's, The Big Lebowski goes down in history as one of the most offensive criticly acclaimed movies of all time.  Over the course of...forever, I have only met ONE person who did not like this movie, and she is CRAZY!!  I love the craziness and jungle-gym style of the plot, and even though it may have been dumb, it worked effectivly.  The Dude was cast perfectly, as well as his best friend.

B0002V7OI8|3.0|Whether Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones is our best black president (both have now played one) is a tossup. Freeman may have the edge. There's real gravitas behind his gravity, and his oratory in the oval office is splendid. In a crisis, either actor is preferable to the current occupant, and there's certainly a crisis looming in \\"Deep Impact.\\" A comet is on a dead reckoning to obliterate Earth and astronauts are enroute to blow it up.    If you think you've seen this movie before, you have (\\"Armageddon,\\" \\"On the Beach,\\" \\"Meteor\\"), but you haven't seen it done this badly. In addition to Robert Duvall, as an astronaut, James Cromwell, Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell appear in throwaway parts, yet their parts are the ones you don't want thrown away. Mimi Leder has no clue how to direct them. Every scene with Tea Leoni, as a TV reporter-turned-anchor, needs to be reshot with a real actress.    As the world awaits doomsday, with the attendant geopolitical run-up to it, there is compelling potential in how humanity will cope. What a picture that might make in this age of CGI, starry casts and Steven Spielberg (who, unfortunately, only produced here.) Instead, the script is interested in teenage romance, families torn apart, panic in the streets, and how MSNBC reports the news (other networks don't exist here.) If MSNBC thought \\"Deep Impact\\" was a promotional coup, it is certainly having second thoughts now.    There are three compensations. A pre-Frodo Elijah Wood gets his first grown-up screen kiss. Freeman can deliver the silliest of lines with such sincerity he really should run for office. And Duvall has a few moving moments chatting with a blinded astronaut. But the movie exudes understated self-importance. Characters face adversity or die with such nobility that to criticize \\"Deep Impact\\" at all seems nitpicky. It's not as though the fate of the world really was at stake. It's only a movie.
076780421X|5.0|This movie was one of the best I have seen in a long time and left me in tears even though the plot doesn't call for it. I would sugest this film for someone who is looking for a fun romanctic movie that has an edge of realism.
B000065V1V|5.0|Bowie has always been my hero, yet this review, I promise, is still objective. I loved Outside, Earthling had its moments, as did Hours, but not until Heathen did David Bowie truly reach the level of quality only attainable by him; a level which he reached so many times in the seventies, and so few times after that (Outside and Buddha of Suburbia being exceptions). What an incredible album this is. Sunday is his finest vocal performance in years, his cover of Cactus blows the Pixies (who I am a fan of) away, Slip Away is just awesome, Slow Burn w/ Pete Townsend rocks like something off of Scary Monsters, Afraid is well crafted and perfectly executed, I've Been Waiting For You is a fantastic Neil Young cover, I Would Be Your Slave is one of the coolest tunes he's written in years, Gemini Spaceship is a decent track, Angels Have Gone has got a killer bass line and an overall eerie feel, Everyone Says Hi is one of my alltime favorite Bowie tracks, I Demand A Better Future is another monster, and the album ends with the fabulous and seemingly prophetic title track. This one is worth every penny. Even though \\"Gemini\\" isn't real strong, it's not as weak as say the horrible title track on Earthling. There are no truly weak moments and Gemini feels like the only filler ( a word rarely used by me in reference to Bowie). Buy it and enjoy it!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is almost like a Japanese movie. It moves very slow but somehow grows on you if you manage to see it to the end. There is no playing to the gallery either as the director lets the film speak for itself without using too many words, the characteristics typical of some of the finest Japanese films. True, all those Japanese characters are depicted rather streotypically, but believe me, they do behave like that. And I found nothing chauvinistic or offensive about that at all. The Last Samurai is a lot worse in that respect. Tokyo is one of the most boring cities in Japan in my opinion but the city as shown in the film looks much more charming than it actually is. The emotional interplay between the two main characters is depicted with subtlety and fineness, showing that they are lost in themselves just as much as they are lost in translation, and that they slowly rediscover themselves while interacting with one another. A very charming film.
B000003489|5.0|Though it is so accessible, make no mistake, this album is art of the highest order and one of Coltrane's finest achievements. It's fast paced, catchy, artsy, technically brilliant, and has not a single weak moment. In fact, most of these tracks are now well-known (well to jazzers) classics, and all of them should be. The band is small but tight, the compositions (all penned by Coltrane) are among the best in Jazz, and Coltrane blows through one unforgettable solo after another. I promise, whether you listen to Jazz or not, these songs will get stuck in your head. Who knows, maybe this album could even get you into Jazz, and trust me, if you're not into Jazz, you're missing out. Some highlights (though the whole thing is practically a highlight) are the title track, Countdown, Spiral, and Mr. PC. Also check out A Love Supreme, Blue Train, Ascension, My Favorite Things, and Meditations.
B000003TA4|4.0|The people who claim Nirvana is bad are mostly people who hate the mainstream music of today, very few people who hate Nirvana have actually heard all their albums. But thats beside the point, I've come to write a review on the MUSIC, not the impact (and I dont even believe it was Nirvana who started the crap of today, I think it was Korn).  <br />   While this CD is most definitely good, it isn't as great as some people say it is. I own a copy and of the twelve songs, six of them are good/great, 4 of them decent/average, and 2 that suck. The 6 good songs are 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'In Bloom', 'Come As You Are', 'Lithium', 'Lounge Act', and 'Ona Plain'. The average songs are 'Polly', 'Territorial Pissings', 'Drain You', and 'Something In The Way'. The crap is 'Breed', and 'Stay Away'. <br />   Every r&r fan has heard Teen Spirit, and most have heard Come As You Are, Lithium, and In Bloom, the are all good songs and have great basslines and songwriting. On A Plain has some of Kurts best songwriting ever, but the chorus could have improved, and Lounge Act has one very catchy (and good) bassline. Polly and Something in the Way are both very good ballads with deep, meaningful lyrics about Kurts past and hometown. The crap songs are the only reason why this doesn't get a five star rating, but hey, nobody's perfect. <br />   Now, as a Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix fan, you would expect me to hate this because of Kurts bad guitar playing, but what he didn't do well in guitar and vocals, he made up for in songwriting and lyrics, which is why he's so great. Kris Novoselic has made a few great basslines in his time, so while he isn't great he's still good. And Dave...I think we can all agree that Dave Grohl is one of the all-time great drummers in rock. <br />   Overall this would probably score a high 3 or low 4....And oh yeah, to that guy who said that Creed and Nickelback were grunge, you should be beaten badly for writing that, joke or no joke.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is the greatest album ever recorded by the greatest band of rock and rollers that have ever lived or ever will. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards pen brilliant tracks infused with there frustration and pain to such a degree that one cannot help but feel it. The guitar work of both aces (Richards and the untouchable Mick Taylor) is raw and rockin'. Jagger's vocals are just sublime and the band has simply never sounded better (though who ever has?). It's impossible to fathom that the Stones recorded Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile consecutively! Excluding Bowie and Roxy Music, those may be the four finest albums ever released. Richards also sings on \\"Happy\\", which was the biggest hit ever to feature him on lead vocals. There are no highlights on this album, because it's all so amazing!
0767817478|3.0|As Shojo Tomiyama (the producer of the Big Guy's flicks for the past few decades) put it, the Tristar Godzilla film removed whatever spiritual power the original monster had, a turned it into a giant iguana-raptor hybrid. Instead of an allegory for the atomic bomb, or even a giant badass who plows through the military and blows up whole city blocks with his heat-ray, this becomes a completely different animal, and THAT is where 'Godzilla's problem lies...that it simply ISN'T Godzilla.<br /><br />As a DvD, this one isn't too bad. The flick is there, the extras are nice (the trailers for 2 actual Godzilla flicks included are a nice treat), but I really don't recommend this DvD for, well, ANYONE.<br /><br />I mean, it's not a 'bad' film, per-say, it simply doesn't stand out, even amoung action films, and it represents a sense of arrogance that comes from disrespect of a world-renowned franchise, and ignorance of what people truly want.<br /><br />It's safe to say that because of this film, every other remake and 'movie version' film to date, following this, have been relatively more loyal to its source material (Spiderman, etc.) So, perhaps a little good came out of it.
0316776963|5.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is the 3rd book I've read by David Sedaris in short succession, and it's the best one thus far.  Like Holidays on Ice and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, it's filled with the Sedaris trademark self-deprecating humor.  But unlike the previous two books, it has much less of a dark-side.  The 28 stories are almost divided in two.  The first part of the book is dedicated to American living.  The second half deals with his trying to survive as an American living in France.<br /><br />The stories about France are the funniest of the bunch.  The French think Sedaris represents all Americans, and they're quick to scold him that American's are prudes (during the Clinton impeachment) or that their tariffs are too high (when the price of American products goes up).  The French are sometimes seen as aloof.  \\"The French have decided to ignore our self-proclaimed superiority, and this is translated as arrogance.  To my knowledge, they've never said that they're better than us; they've just never said that we're the best.\\"  Even more confusing is trying to figure out the French language.  All nouns are assigned a sex, and it's often something that defies logic.  \\"Hysteria, psychosis, torture, depression,\\" Niagara Falls, Georgia, Florida and New England are all feminine.<br /><br />\\"Murder, toothache, and Rollerblade,\\" sandwich, corn, string beans, the Grand Canyon, Montana, and Utah are all masculine.  Sedaris gives up trying to figure them out, and just orders things in two or more.  By using the plural, one uses the plural article rather than the article that reflects gender.  This gets a bit expensive when Sedaris starts ordering two appliances, chickens, etc.  It's also hard to store everything.<br /><br />One funny story has Sedaris taking an IQ test with Mensa.  He is crushed when he receives the results and discovers that he's not even close to being classified a genius.  Still, I think that Sedaris is a keen observer of life and a brilliant writer.  In the long run, I think those things are more important than IQ any day.nt writer.  In the long run, I think those things are more important than IQ any day.   <br />
B00005JLEJ|3.0|I had Kagemusha for several years on VHS, before going exclusively DVD. I remember Kagemusha as one of Akira Kurosawa's best movies, in my opinion, second only to Throne of Blood. I was awaiting the delivery of <br />the Criterion edition of this movie with great excitement. It was a letdown.  <br />Be warned that this is the mutilated Francis Ford Coppola version, and not the original one!  <br />Almost the whole magnificient battle at the end of the movie has been cut. As it is not violent by today's standards, one can wonder why? And while the quality of the movie is OK, I had expected it to be much better. <br />One can only hope that one day Kagemusha will be issued in a complete version, so we can watch this movie in all it's splendour, and the way Kurosawa wanted it to be.
B00005JL78|2.0|This was an interesting effort;  unfortunately, the movie ran about a half hour (or more) too long. <br />It should have ended when \\"Anderton\\" was captured and  <br />and imprisoned in deep freeze -THE END - rather than using every alternate plot twist and ending they had apparently filmed, stitched together.     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNNZ|5.0|\\"Coach Carter\\" is about a private citizen who returns to his high school alma mater to coach the woeful Richmond Oilers basketball team. Believing that the primary purpose of high school is academics rather than sports, he begins to train these student athletes in the fundamentals, on and off the court. However, in the middle of a winning season, Coach Carter benches the entire team for low academic performance and the community rebels.<br /><br />At another level, this film is more about life and community values than high school basketball. This story is very similar to \\"Friday Night Lights\\" cast in an urban setting instead of small town Texas. But the principles are the same. So are the values: self-improvement, education, honor, respect, integrity, teamwork, leadership, excellence, faith.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson performs this role with charisma, grit, and determination. He soars in this role and lifts the whole film with him.
B000002G87|5.0|Though I have always had the deepest of respect for Mr. Clapton, this album was the album that really showed me what was so special about him. While mostly known for its stunning title track, each and every track on this album is more than worth the entire price. Clapton not only shines on the guitar, but he also gives the most passionate and moving vocal performance of his career. Duane Allman and Eric Clapton bring out the absolute best in each other's playing, and the rest of the band is also breathtaking. Anyone who likes blues, classic rock, or just good music should thoroughly enjoy this musical landmark. I never understood why Eric Clapton was considered among the Gods of rock until I heard this album. Anyone who has ever had any doubts about him should truly check this out.

By compiling her childhood memories, Marjane is, indeed, sharing with the world, the sufferance that Iranian adolescents went through in the poque of 1980s. Never had I dared to dream that one day, a story-teller as powerful as Marjane, would depict the seemingly insignificant anecdotes of my childhood, simultaneously embellishing them with simple yet impressive illustrations. Thank you Marjane, for engraving the memories of a nation into the pages of history, thus rendering them eternal.
1401301010|5.0|This book really surprised me.  I thought it was well written, thoroughly researched and has made Anthony Kiedes much more human to me and not some cartoonish lead singer for one of the best bands to come out of LA in 20 years.  Kudos to you!  You did a fabulous job of it.
B0002858YS|5.0|First off, let me just say that I own this album, obviously, and its by far in the top 5 of best debut albums I have ever heard.  I can't quite figure out exactly why its not getting that good of reviews from the people who have written.<br /><br />Second off, why do so many people just assume that The Killers are trying to rip off some 80's era new wave group when instead they might actually have some talent of their own and they are really just THAT good in their own right?  Sure they have their influences that incorporate into their sound, but if you like the sound of the music, why should you really care!?<br /><br />When I first heard their album, I distinctively remember thinking to myself that they were like nothing I had heard in quite some time, so to me, they are refreshing and exactly the type of music I needed to add to my collection.<br /><br />Whoever says the album is \\"garbage\\" was just having a bad day when they wrote their review.<br /><br />I could go into a play by play of why I love the album, but I personally think you should just take a leap of faith and figure it out for yourself.  If you don't like it, too bad, because I know The Killers are here to stay.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|When I heard they were making a movie out of the acclaimed musical, I was heartbroken.  Having seen the musical at St. Louis' beautiful Fox Theatre in 1993, I thought there was no way a movie could compare to it.  The music is inspiring and heartwrenching at the same time.  I couldn't imagine someone else singing those songs.  I thought Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were the end all be all.  They made the musical work.  <br /> <br />Finally a friend told me I should give it a try.  After the first five minutes, I was hooked and proven wrong.  I had never heard of Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum so I assumed they were stage stars.  When I found out they weren't, I was even more amazed.  Butler gives The Phantom something Michael Crawford couldn't and that was sexuality.  I can see why Christine yearns for him now.  Rossum does a spectacular job at bringing youth and vibrance to the role.  The singing they do does not have the polished edge to it that the stage stars have which I think is wonderful.  It brings you to a new level.  You can hear the anguish in The Phantom's voice and the heartbreak and fear in Christine's.   <br /> <br />I only gave it 4 stars because of the young man playing Raoul.  He plays it a bit too aloof and I'm not as impressed by him but it does not affect the overall movie. <br /> <br />Buy the movie and then buy the CD.  Both are worth every penny.

B00063MBU8|5.0|i am going to be prefectly honest...though now a days it isnt the \\"cool\\" thing to like simple plan, this album is very good. they matured like most musicians do, the difference is that they didnt totally change their sound. no their lyrics dont appeal to everyone and yes their lyrics are for a younger crowd but that doesnt change the fact that this band has tallent.  <br />if someone is going to influence you to not buy this album because they say simple plan isnt punk enough, then whatever. they're right. simple plan isnt punk. i would more describe their sound as pop rock. but its good pop rock. they are good at what they do and it shows on this album. there is a variety of slow and fast songs. i listen to this album all the time and im not ashamed one bit to admit it. from shut up to untitled there isnt one song on this album i dont like. ill be 18 in about a month and a half and i can still relate to their lyrics.  <br />simple plan didnt ask you to call them punk. they didnt ask to be on mtv. if you are going to have an opinion about simple plan, make it yourself. dont say what everyone else is saying. is it a bad thing that a band with good music has fans that want to see their music videos on trl? well i certainly dont think so. this cd is worth every penny. <br />the dvd that comes with it is also extremely entertaining

The Germans would routinely attack a force, out pace the attacking force and attack again!<br /><br />Get this book, you will read it twice.

1573223026|5.0|So what don't you know by now?  This fourth novel by Nick Hornby is a comedy about (and told through the personae of) four very dissimilar characters -- Martin, Maureen, Jess and JJ -- who form an unlikely gang.  They meet on New Year's Eve on a London rooftop that is a fabled jumping-off point to the next life.  These four would-be suicides give each other a rationalization, however flimsy, for not jumping, and they agree to meet periodically over the next several months to provide each other with encouragement and reinforcement and ultimately to test their resolve to try it -- or not try it -- again.<br /><br />Hornby is a witty and compassionate chronicler of the desperation of these ordinary people.  His brisk writing impells the story forward while his band of four tries to unravel the tangles of their respective miseries with both hilarious and touching results.  Each is offered new possibilities, and all come to realize, as one character puts it near the end of the book, that what drew them to the rooftop was not a disdain for life but a love of it that made the unhappiness of their previous circumstances unbearable.<br /><br />There are two ways down.  It is a grace that this gifted writer chose to tell us about the long one.
068987474X|3.0|I first heard about the book on Oprah and heard many high reviews about it from several of my friends, so when I had the chance to read this book the other week, I jumped right at the opportunity.  <br /> <br />Perhaps I went into it with high expectations, but I found myself highly disappointed. The book is split up into different chapters for different situations that women usually run into with men, but by the first few of chapters, the book's catchphrase became old and boring, maybe even annoying. I had gotten the point already, if a guy likes you, he'll do almost anything to steal your heart. <br /> <br />The high point of this book was that it shed some light onto the now clich question, \\"Why doesn't he call me?\\" and other questions that women constantly bring up with their close string of girlfriends. It was very interesting to have a guy's blunt point of view on these matters. The book did prove to be insightful in some matters, but if you're looking for a book to understanding the male mind when it comes to relationships, this probably isn't your best bet.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Really great film all a round. Easily one of my favorites of last year. Totally original, totally creepy. Saw definitely delivers on all the horror/suspense levels... Maybe a few twists too many(?), but still easy to follow and still an excellent film.
B0009X766Y|5.0|FINALLY, they are set to release a widescreen deluxe version of this classic.  You'd think they would've done it a lot sooner with a Best Picture Oscar winner, but better late than never.  Hopefully, the presentation will be as good as the film.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|I'm always skeptical when I see ads for films like \\"Coach Carter\\" because they're so often filled with melodrama.<br /><br />This film, too, has moments of clich&eacute; and sensationalism, but it fights hard to keep these to a minimum and succeeds often enough to make it entertaining. Part of the appeal comes from Samuel L. Jackson's strong persona, and the fact that the story itself is based on true events. But, the real strength of the film lies primarily with its young, unknown actors. The boys are true to their characters, even when the dialogue must have made them cringe.<br /><br />Like an inner-city \\"Hoosiers,\\" though lacking that film's depth, \\"Coach Carter\\" tells the true story of Ken Carter, a determined coach who takes over a team of problem kids and turns them into winners, both on and off the court. He teaches them discipline, respect for themselves and others, and even asks them to sign a contract stating that they will promise to keep their GPA at or above a 2.3 average, that they will be on time and that they will wear ties on game days. This causes a stir among the players, their parents and the principal of the school, but when they see the results of Carter's teachings, they come to respect his unorthodox ways, especially when the team starts winning. His extreme methods are questioned again, however, when he locks the gym, cancels practice and forfeits two games after discovering that the boys are struggling academically. Determined to raise their grades and give them a fighting chance to go to college, Carter takes them off the court and into the library for tutoring and studying. This brings him a rash of violent threats, parental lashings and even a school board hearing, forcing him to stand behind his convictions and defend his beliefs.<br /><br />I won't ruin the ending by going on, but suffice it to say that lessons are learned and the boys come out better students and better people as a result of Carter's hard-nosed military-like tactics.<br /><br />The basketball scenes are exciting and well orchestrated in this film. But, the real strengths of this film come from the boys themselves, their characters and their inner struggles off the court. Their challenges come in the forms of teen pregnancy and a shooting, along with the everyday trials of living in an area where they are 50 percent more likely to go to prison than to graduate from high school.<br /><br />Rick Gonzalez turns in a solid performance as a kid struggling to decide between basketball and working for his cousin as a drug dealer. Rob Brown also shines as a player with real promise both academically and athletically, but who has a pregnant girlfriend that forces him to make some very adult choices before he's ready.<br /><br />Overall, however, there isn't a bad portrayal among the teens. They play their roles with honesty and depth, as though they don't know any other way. It's refreshing and real, and it takes an otherwise average film to another level.s.  <br /> <br />The basketball scenes are exciting and well orchestrated in this film.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay, in terms of pop music, is doing an excellent job. I don't buy the claims that they are a hybrid of Radiohead and U2; I think Coldplay has their own style and they are a still growing into it. This is their third album and I think they have grown quite a bit. The drums, bass and guitars are definitely more audible this time, aiding the singer's/pianist's weak points. I think this is their first album where I feel that they are truly a band rather than a solo project (Chris, I think his name is) with a backup. I honestly wouldn't buy something solo from Chris, and I would love to see them grow as a band.     The first three songs ('Square One', 'What If', and 'White Shadows') are excellent on the X (esp. 'What If', my personal fave). Y isn't quite as strong, 'Speed of Sound', 'A Message', and 'Low' are pretty nice. They could have kept the rest... especially the bonus track (which really isn't a bonus). But all in all, I think this album screams Pop, and that's not a bad thing altogether. I don't pretend like I'm an important music critic who cannot bare to listen to pop as if it were below me.  Coldplay has to make money, and they have to make music that defines them as artists in some way-- X&Y is the happy medium. I like the album quite a bit. I realize it is pop; I have no extremely high expectations, I don't compare them with others unjustly, and I'm very interested to see what they do next.
0006755232|5.0|You may be reading this because you've recently watched the Miyazaki interpretation of Howl's Moving Castle. If you're wondering whether or not you should bother to read the book, the answer is YES!! This is an excellent book, one of my favourites. Miyazaki only skimmed the surface of its depths. He also altered the story and some of the characters so read with an open mind and prepare to fall in love with Sophie, Howl, Calcifer (who, by the way is blue not orange), Michael (not Markl and actually a teenager), and all the magic that goes with them. <br />Diana Wynne Jones is much more subtle with her lessons in the book than Miyazaki is in the movie so don't expect the &quot;war is bad&quot; and &quot;love is good&quot; lessons to be thrown in your face. In fact, there isn't even a war in the book! That was something that was added in the jump from page to screen. <br />Quick, go read the book! (The sequel is Castle in the Air... also very good and ironically the title of another very different Miyazaki film.)
0440241413|4.0|I had the book for a long time before I actually sat down on Friday to read it... and I couldn't let go (except for a quick shopping trip on Saturday ;) I was finished by Sunday right before dinner time! It had me laughing out loud, smiling and cringing at the thought that I can be so like Becky sometimes... many times... It is an enjoyable book. Great summer reading, fun and relaxing with the fairy tale parts very well inter-twined with the rest of the story. I could not stop laughing when I read about the job interview with the Bank of Helsinki! but the entire book is entertaining and cute. I love its fashion sense too!
B0006L16N8|3.0|If this were the first album by an unknown band we would consider it a great first effort and hope for better in the future. As it stands Coldplay has released two great albums and this one is a let down. I'm not saying it is terrible, it is good, but it deffinitely is not great. I gave it a long time to grow on me and have come to the realiziation that it just doesn't stand up to the quality of their first two album and even some of the B-sides for that matter.  <br /> <br />10 years from now this wont be considered their best album and despite all the hype it isn't their best album today. Infatuation doesn't make something great.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|This is one of my favorites despite all the critism it receives. This movie had changed the scene of the underground car world. Great story, good cast of actors, pretty good acting, great ensemble of cars(except for the Maxima & Jetta) and appropriate soundtrack. Its a view of the street scene on the Westcoast where it all started. Being a car enthusiast/import tuner, i knew the movie wasnt entirely accurate - especially with the technical lingo used. The movie was shot in places that i was familiar with (LA area) so it was something i could relate to. Paul Walker(Brian)  and Jordana Brewster(Mia) had a great onscreen chemistry. Vin Diesel's character was a great addition to the story. I believe this movie put Diesel on the showbusiness map and made him much more popular following his debut in Pitch Black in 1999. The scene in the movie that really got my attention was when the Supra and faced the Ferrari on Pacific Coast Hwy goin to Malibu. Being a MKIV Supra owner myself, i knew what Supras are capable of. So that much i knew was accurate. In a sense this movie immortalized the Supra. It also shows a bit of the old vs. the new school of street race cars. Overall, a good movie.
B000679N96|4.0|The Cure is easily one of my all time favorite bands, especially from the new wave/punk era. I recently acquired their 1979 debut album \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" (the deluxe edition). I have to admit that the bonus disc of demo, live, and bonus tracks are an acquired taste. I love \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" (the bonus track, not the studio demo). I personally found the bonus disc a hit or miss. Some of the songs worked for me and some were misses. As for the album itself, I love \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\". Over 20 years later, the music still sounds fresh and not dated. I haven't heard the original album so I can't compare the producation quality. The songs are more harder edged and does not have the lush sounds of the band's eponymous classic \\"Disintegration\\". All the songs are great. They are short but that's fine with me. Diehard fans of The Cure might appreciate the bonus disc but I am simply happy with the remastered version of their albums.
B000244EMO|5.0|I knew this movie was going to rock right when it started when I saw this movie at the theater back in 1987 - the cast of bad hombres (including Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers) as they stepped out of the helicopter, that great music, the creature created by Stan Winston and then directed by John MacTiernan...    The action is fairly non-stop as Arnold's rescue team is assigned to retrieve some diplomats (or so they think) from straying across a border. They end up finding the remains of a previous team that went in but didn't come out. The team ends up taking out a small army of revolutionaries (sound effects are top-notch but after several viewings, the editing and quick-cuts are exposed as needing some improvement) all the while being monitored by the Predator who eventually starts hunting Arnie's team for sport. The action is intense and well-choreographed.    The Predator himself was just too cool - loved that Rastafarian hair... one of my favorite scenes is when the Predator comes out of the water after chasing Arnold... oh yeah..    As an aside, Kevin Peter Hall who played the Predator does have a cameo at the very end of the film as the African-American crewmember on the helicopter.    Language and crude jokes aside (if such is offensive to you, you may want to catch the movie on cable TV where it's fairly sanitized), this is one movie you want to have a large, widescreen TV with surround sound and crank it!!
B0007P3582|1.0|This album is proof that 50 was never hiphop. Me personally I never liked him for the simple fact that he has to beef with somebody and whine about getting shot 9 times to sell records. Look at the record label that signed him: shady records. How are you gonna believe somebody whose signed to a record label appropriately called shady records? This is how people get pimped because they dont listen to reason they listen to the media as if that wasnt the biggest part of their problem anyway! Fiddy's last album was dope beat-wise but lyrically he got murdered by everybody he collaborated with. This album sucked beat-wise and lyric-wise! His tired beef with jarule got stale so who does he diss now? Fat joe, Jadakiss and Nas. All three have destroyed him on different mixtapes plus he was never mc material to begin with! When jarule finally dissed him in Loose Change what was fiddy and white rupaul's comeback response? Frail mary with busta rhymes the worst diss record of all time. Busta's decent and original verse couldnt save this record from being lame! After all this how can people still ride 50's d**k knowing when he gets dissed he's gonna start biting 2pac's rhymes word for word again? People need to quit falling for the hype especially when the same people that are being hyped up cant live up to the hype!
B0000C1733|5.0|I love the Red Hot chilli peppers. Their an original band that many bands today can only try to imitate. They've been around and the hits on this album are all classics. I went to Best Buy and bought several cd's and this happens to get the most rotation. Im not new to the band but i gotta say for the newcomers, Every song on this album is a great hit!
B000002BE9|5.0|One of the best CD's of  the 90s, and one of the most underated. If your expecting to hear a lot of upbeat, angry songs like her big hit \\"Criminal,\\" think again. Most of the music on here is soft, and delicate, but at the same time it is very angry and filled with levels of such emotional depth, you will love it. As soon as \\"Sleep To Dream\\" hits the speakers, I was drawn into the sensational piano intro the minute I opened my ears. Next comes the track \\"Sullen Girl,\\" which surely fit's its name. A sad, desolate, kind of tune. Fiona's voice is just beautiful and I love the lyrics. \\"You took my pearl, and left an empty shell of me.\\" Track 3, \\"Shadow Boxer\\" is definetly a favorite of mine. Piano players will definetly want to learn to play the awesome beat of this one. (I do.) As for the song on lyrics and vocals, it has a simaler angry effect much like the 4th track, I imagine you've all heard by now, \\"Criminal.\\" Towards track 5. \\"Slow Like Honey,\\" things do tend to actually slow down, but this isn't a bad thing! The songs are sweet, mellow, and very relaxing just as they are. Track 5 is very dreamy, smooth, and mysterious. Much like the ones that continue from the undeniable swaying catchiness of \\"The First Taste,\\" to the melancholy, haunting, \\"The Child Is Gone.\\" And the cd doesn't stop there. \\"Never is a promise,\\" is a very beautiful song. Her vocals couldn't be more soft and light as a feather than on \\"Pale September,\\" and the cd ends off nicely with the gentle, yet slightly upbeat \\"Carrion.\\" This is one of my favorite softy music cds, and if your looking for some music that is mellow, pretty, light, yet, with some energy in it that won't bore you to death, then I reccommend you give this one a listen. (the booklet includes the lyrics too!)
0312323859|5.0|First of all, if you're considering reading this book, be sure to read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first. I decided to read Emily Giffin's debut novel last year because I was looking for something light and fun (and I also happened to be newly engaged and liked the sparkly diamond on the pretty pink cover!). I was pleasantly surprised to discover that GOOD chick lit actually does exist!<br /><br />To summarize the plot, \\"Something Borrowed\\" is about two girls who have been best friends their entire lives. Rachel is a smart girl with average looks who has always played second-fiddle to her glamourous, selfish friend Darcy. On the eve of Rachel's 30th birthday party, she gets drunk and ends up in bed with Darcy's fiance, Dexter. Even though Rachel tries to extinguish her feelings for Dex, she ends up falling in love with him. It turns out that Darcy had been cheating on Dex with one of his best friends, so at the end of \\"Something Borrowed,\\" Darcy and Dex break off their engagement after they learn of each other's indiscretions, leaving Dex free to be with Rachel.<br /><br />\\"Something Blue\\" picks up right where \\"Something Borrowed\\" left off, only this time the narrator switches from Rachel to Darcy. Giffin actually walks us back through the climax of \\"Something Borrowed,\\" so we get to see all the drama unfold from Darcy's point of view. As things stand, Dex and Rachel are together and Darcy is furious with both of them. However, she's pregnant by her new boyfriend, Marcus, and is excited about starting a new life with him. Unfortunately, Marcus is less than thrilled with the arrangement, and it doesn't take Darcy long to realize that her new beau isn't the fabulous catch she thought he would be. Being the conniving little witch that she is, Darcy tries every dirty trick in the book to get her life back in order again, but no one sees through her desperate charades and the only so-called \\"friends\\" she has left betray her. Poor Darcy finds herself pregnant and alone with no one to turn to. The only thing she can think of to do is flee New York and head to London to stay with her childhood friend, Ethan, in hopes of building a fresh start for herself far away from everyone that hurt her.<br /><br />At first I didn't think \\"Something Borrowed\\" would live up to its predecessor. Eventually I realized that was because Giffin does such a good job portraying Darcy as the selfish little witch that she is! However, Darcy's nastiness is what makes the book so good. We get to see how, with the help of Ethan, Darcy decides to better herself for her own sake and for the sake of her unborn baby. She hits some major bumps along the way, but by the end of the book Darcy has become even more endearing than Rachel...I never thought that would be possible, but it is!<br /><br />\\"Something Blue\\" does a great job of connecting the readers with Darcy's character and also tying up all the loose ends between Darcy, Rachel, and Dexter. I read this book in one night because I just couldn't put it down. The only thing that disappoints me is that there's really no way Giffin can write another installment of the Rachel/Darcy saga...I'm sad that it's all over! But this book is one of the rare sequels that might actually be better than the original book. I highly suggest reading \\"Something Blue\\" (and \\"Something Borrowed,\\" if you haven't already done so!).no one to turn to.

0062502182|5.0|Usually I can't stand \\"inspirational\\" fiction.  I found \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" to be one of the worst crimes committed against the English language in the 90's.  I need insulin shots after even touching a volume of Chicken Soup for the Soul or any of Richard Bach's pablum. <br /> <br />Yet I enjoyed The Alchemist from beginning to end.  What gives? <br /> <br />The Alchemist is simply a joy to read, a Brazillian \\"Siddhartha\\".  The tale is spare but gripping, as any good fable should be.  While some of the messages of the story may be of dubious merit, one can't help but be pulled in by Santiago's journey, and even notice paralells in one's own life.  Unlike many \\"inspirational\\" novels, you aren't bombed with \\"profound cosmic insights\\"- in fact, the author seems to go out of his way to avoid presenting a lesson that is anything more than metaphorical. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for an afternoon's reading.  Might make a good gift as well...

B000056PWV|4.0|In the movie REAR WINDOW the audience watches the hero watch his neighbors. Freelance photographer L. B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is in a wheelchair and housebound while waiting for his broken leg to heal. His only visitors are his girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly)and his unsympathetic, wisecracking nurse Stella played by wonderful Thelma Ritter. With nothing to do and limited visitors Jeffries spends his time looking out of his apartment rear window and into the windows of his neighbors. As he looks, he finds himself drawn into their lives. The woman who nags her traveling salesman husband, the newlyweds who keep their window shade down at all times except when they occasionally come up for air; the beautiful young ballet dancer who practices everyday, the unsuccessful composer, the older couple with the little dog who does nothing but bark and middle-aged woman Jeffries has dubbed \\"Miss Lonelyhearts.\\" Miss Lonelyhearts lives alone but sets her dinner table for two and holds conversations with her make imaginary lover.<br /><br />When Jeffries relates the daily goings on to his girlfriend Lisa, she chastises him for being a voyeur and invading his neighbors privacy. Jeffries nurse Stella notes that \\"We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change.\\" Nevertheless Jeffries continues watch. He now uses his binoculars and his always by his side camera. Then he notices that the salesman's nagging wife is not only quiet but absent from the scene. What happened to her? Jeffries watches the salesman as he appears to cautiously leave his apartment in the middle of the night. Why is he sneaking out of his own home? Why is the salesman cleaning knives and a saw, what where they used for? What was in the trunk that he had shipped? Jeffries is convinced that the salesman has killed his wife. He sets out to prove it. He enlists the help of a friend, Thomas Doyle (Wendall Corey) who is a lieutenant in the police department. Jeffries also believes that the salesman, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) has killed his neighbors small dog because the dog was digging in the garden for something that the salesman had buried. He wants Doyle to investigate even there is no evidence that this is true.<br /><br />As with all Alfred Hitchcock movies, you can always find humor just below the surface.

B0009HLDFU|3.0|Dave Grohl, the best of you seems to have definitively come out on your self-titled Foo Fighters release, way back when in 1995. Ah, the Dave of those days was so concerned with the shadow of Nirvana that he attempted to release the album on the hush-hush, without making prominent the fact that he once drummed for the greatest rock band of our generation... not that this worked, ultimately. But the ethos here was instilled with pride in making music for the sake of it; you can still hear it on songs like \\"I'll Stick Around\\" and \\"Exhausted.\\"  <br /> <br />Moving from underground indie-flavored rock on their self-titled to making one of the best records of the '90s with \\"The Colour and the Shape,\\" to recording a grunge-pop gem with \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose,\\" to the more synthetic but still catchy, Grammy-winning \\"One By One,\\" the Foo Fighters have finally arrived here, at what Grohl wants us to believe is his magnum opus. Hate to say it, but he's showing his age.  <br /> <br />\\"In Your Honor\\" is by no means a bad record. Feed me songs like \\"Everlong,\\" \\"Stacked Actors,\\" and \\"Times Like These,\\" though, and it's no surprise that \\"Best of You\\" doesn't stack up. The first time I heard it, I took it to mean that the Foos were releasing a double b-sides album. Now that I've heard it ten thousand times, I find myself pining for the days of \\"Pokey the Little Puppy\\" (a song from Dave Grohl's Nirvana-era 'Pocketwatch' demo which included an early version of \\"Friend of a Friend,\\" seen realized here on disc 2 of \\"In Your Honor\\").  <br /> <br />As cliched as it is to say, the thrill is gone, and that is primarily what I find to dislike in these records. Nothing here smashes you up against the wall like the high octane \\"Monkey Wrench\\" and nothing can come close to matching up with \\"Everlong\\"'s delicate thunder. Grohl actually sounds tired as he's delivering the throaty yelps on \\"In Your Honor\\"'s first disc. Whether through cause of poor production, lack of inspiration or simple greed, this rock 'n' roll is, sonically, just another day at the office, sounding so pedestrian that you almost think the Queens of the Stone Age will ride up from nowhere and smash into the Foos at a crosswalk in a monster truck of riffage... until you hear THEIR latest album.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the acoustic half of \\"In Your Honor\\" is where the Foo Fighters are ultimately headed. Before his suicide in 1994, Kurt Cobain alluded in various settings that this is the direction he was wanting to go himself with Nirvana. Maybe it makes sense, and maybe it's time. \\"Friend of a Friend\\" is an obvious standout here... but it's played essentially the exact same way as on its debut on a Grohl demo from a decade earlier. The twinkle of \\"Over and Out\\" is more gripping than anything from the opposing disc of rock, with a nice mix of strings combining with acoustic guitar and bass to cook up a gentle pop song. \\"Razor\\" closes the second disc fabulously, beginning with a repeating figure that reminds this listener of a spider or some such. Such delicacy simply isn't found on disc 1, where Grohl's attempted guitar histrionics mostly fall flat into the mud. As such, the other side of the Foo Fighters coin that the public doesn't get to see much takes the show on this release.  <br /> <br />In short, nothing is wrong with this record beyond the predictable lack of 100% quality which some still blindly expect from double albums even in a post-\\"Mellon Collie\\" and \\"The Fragile\\" world. It's not where I wish the Foo Fighters would still be, but seeing as how they've been a radio staple for long enough to distance themselves from their roots (*cough* Nirvana *cough*), it's easy to understand that musical evolution exists, and may not always leave a band where listeners would have liked. Frankly, however, anyone who thinks this is a better record than either of the Foo Fighters' two early releases is either a.) in their early teens and ignorant of the very existence of Nirvana, let aloneDave Grohl's role as their drummer, or b.) Dave Grohl.  <br /> <br />On the issue of copy protection, I will chime in with: yes, recording conglomerates molesting consumer rights with ridiculous copyright schemes is indeed a sign of impending apocalypse, but in all fairness, it's nothing the Foo Fighters have done. In the music business, a band either jumps through flaming hoops into giant piles of dung for money or they're told to hit the road. More to the point, even, \\"[COPY PROTECTED CD]\\" is written as prominently as possible WITH THE TITLE OF THE RECORD on Amazon, so it's not as if the consumer is being stabbed in the back. The apparently selectively tech savvy iPod community apparently didn't talk to the same little birdie I did, who tells me that any copy protection scheme ever devised by man is almost immediately undone by a 13-year old boy from Norway. If it's truly imperative that you listen to this album on your bold new status symbol of the Information Era, I'm quite sure someone can tell you how to do so.  <br /> <br />Until then, please cease using Amazon.com as a soapbox/message board and review the content like the guidelines suggest. It would make the birdie and I quite happy.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|As far as remakes go, this one isn't too bad.  It's hard to translate the cultural aspects, which play a major role in the original Japanese version, but they managed to recreate that part of the conflict quite nicely. <br /> <br />As a ballroom dancer, I was somewhat torn with this movie.  There were some very obvious glaring errors in it, for anyone who knows ANYTHING about ballroom dancing.  However, the story was enjoyable enough and the characters likable enough that it generally made up for it. <br /> <br />Richard Gere truly shines in this film.  After the hit film \\"Chicago,\\" it became obvious that Gere has quite a talent for dancing, and it was wonderful that he was able to further improve that particular gift in this show.  Gere has an undeniable presence on the screen, which added so much to his role in \\"Shall We Dance.\\"  His character was charming and real, and I found myself really cheering for him.  And heck, I wouldn't mind seeing him do more ballroom dancing, he really has a great feel for it!  If I didn't know better, I'd say he'd been doing ballroom for much longer than it took to make this film. <br /> <br />Susan Sarandon was completely believable as his wife, and I liked her as much as I liked Gere.  I wanted to see even more of her.  I think my favorite scene with her was when she was trying to learn a little about ballroom dancing herself, secretly trying to gain understanding from a book and dancing in the bedroom just as her husband had done so covertly. <br /> <br />Stanley Tucci was, as always, brilliantly hilarious in his role as Gere's coworker.  Playing a Latin dancer trying to hide his passion for the sport, Tucci provides a good amount of the comedy in this show.  I wasn't quite expecting his role to be what it was, and he isn't the dancer that Gere is, but it's obvious he had fun with it, and that was great to watch.  I thought he was perfect for that role. <br /> <br />While I did enjoy Jennifer Lopez's dancing, I must confess that Ifound her character a little too two-dimensional for my taste.  She was actually one of my LEAST favorite characters in the piece, and I didn't quite buy her as a professional dancer in the flashbacks --- especially since she was dancing with one of the best standard ballroom dancers in the world, Gary McDonald.  However, I did thoroughly enjoy the scene in which she taught Gere how to feel the music, using an incredible tango I had never heard before. <br /> <br />The music in this show is quite good.  You really need good music in a dance movie, and this has an excellent soundtrack, which I dance to all the time.  The tango especially is quite unique --- sort of a cross between a tango and a rumba. <br /> <br />The costumes are also quite impressive.  Designs by Randall contributed the ballroom costumes, and in fact, I have seen a couple of those costumes in action before, at real competitions!  That was a neat connection I was able to make. <br /> <br />The complaints I had about the movie were few, actually.  My biggest problem was during the Latin competition.  They spent all this time talking about the rumba --- and Gere even MENTIONS that the Novice dances are rumba and cha-cha --- and then at the actual competition, suddenly they're doing a paso doble?!?  That was incredibly annoying, especially with all the build-up they had beforehand.  And frankly, you will never EVER see a paso doble done at the Novice level at competition, it's always rumba and either cha-cha or samba.  I was at a complete loss as to why they did that. <br /> <br />Other than that, there were just little things that a ballroom dancer would easily catch, and Tucci drops a competely unnecessary f-bomb. <br /> <br />But on the whole, this is a fun movie, and one I would recommend to most people.  I would like to see Richard Gere do MORE dancing movies in future!
B00005QFE5|4.0|Nice movie--excellent scenery! <br />Luo Yushengs father has died--and he returns home for the first time in years to attend the funeral--which his mother wants to be traditional.  The meeting of his parents then becomes the focal point of the story, as it is recounted!  Romantic, without hollywoods prerequisite make out scenes--this is a fine story for all ages. From a broken bowl to a lost hairpin to Luo's young mother waiting in the snow for his fathers return--this is a very moving story--of simpler lives and simpler times. <br />Interesting variation-the current scenes are in black and white--but the recollections of days gone by are in color! <br />Audio is mandarin with a choice of dubbed French--and English subtitles.

0805066691|5.0|I had an auto mechanic the other day tell me we need to move on and FORGET what happened in the past! That is an ignorant statement. If you watch \\"Incident at Oglala- The Leonard Peltier Story\\" (an activist for the AIM- American Indian Movement who was wrongly accused of killing 2 FBI agents during the 1973 siege at Wounded Knee,South Dakota and is still inmprisoned in Leavenworth - speak out for his release) , and read \\"Trail of Tears\\" by Gloria Jahoda, how can anyone deny the continual blatant, evil, treatment of Native Americans to this very day.  If you have read this book buy copies for your friends birthdays and give it to them.  At Christmas time give a copy to your friends, relatives, and enemies and tell them to read this book. Anyone with a conscience cannot deny the truth. The history of American Native's blood spilled on their own land is screaming that the U.S. Government should stop the Nazi treatment of our brothers and sisters. But to this day they have not.  We need to raise our voices until they are heard and let politicians and the world know we are not going to stand for the way our brothers and sisters are still being robbed, cheated, and lied to. Read this book and if you don't share it with others you are as guilty as the soldiers (I am ashamed to call them Americans) of our government who were told during the genocidal removal during the \\"Trail of Tears\\" \\"... if they give you any trouble use your boothils to get rid of them, because we don't want you to waste our bullets on them.\\" My great, great grandmother was murdered on the \\"Trail of Tears\\" and I will never, as long as I breathe, forget that time or my other brothers and sisters that have been imprisoned, deceived, mistreated, and murdered without cause or reason to this day. To the negative, ridiculous people who have given this book a low rating, ignore them and read this book. You cannot be the same if you still have a heart and soul. This book should receive 100 stars.

B0001KZM3O|4.0|An album with a perhaps somewhat-undeserved reputation, Pink Floyd's \\"The Final Cut\\" is listed on the back cover as \\"A Requiem for the Post-War Dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd\\".  This is probably the most accurate way to look at the record, it is a Roger Waters album, with David Gilmour and Nick Mason part of the backing band (keyboardist Richard Wright had been ejected from the band and even Mason's contributions were limited, with a percussionist added and another drummer on the closing track). <br /> <br />The album, like all the Floyd records prior, follows a concept-- intermingling reflections on the then-current world political climate (notably Thatcher's attack on the Falkland Islands) with the story of a soldier coming back from war to find the world quite changed (evidentally parts of this were originally written for \\"The Wall\\" to provide backstory for the teacher, who was also a veteran like the protagonist's father).  Several themes are reprised a couple times throughout the album, most notably the \\"what have we done\\" vocal, which reappears sung or hummed (per suggestion of Nick Mason) throughout the record. <br /> <br />The result is a dense, lyrically-driven album that, like \\"The Wall\\" before it, largely abandons the open structures found on previous Floyd records.  With Waters firmly in control and pushing his lyrical message, Gilmour's guitar is largely restrained and there's little of the openness and expansive structures of the previous albums.  But this isn't necessarily a criticism-- Waters delivers his lyrics with a passion and intensity he rarely reached in the past, and a number of the pieces are superb, particularly when the backgrounds are at their sparsest, letting the lyrics breathe-- \\"Paranoid Eyes\\", \\"Southampton Dock\\", \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" are all quite notable.  The latter in particular is one of the best lyrics Waters has ever composed. <br /> <br />A couple notes about the remaster-- they've finally corrected the track split between \\"Southampton Dock\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" (the last note of the former ended up on the latter) and added to the album is \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\".  Originally recorded for \\"The Wall\\" movie, it matches the mood and intensity of the record well, Waters is filled with venom, but the orchestration sounds out of place. <br /> <br />Ths is really a record that needs to be listened to for opinions-- I find it to be very rewarding in its own way.  If you enjoyed \\"The Wall\\" and Waters' solo material (particularly \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchiking\\", which is very similar to this), you should definitely check out this record.

B000006TRV|5.0|Some music has filtered its way into our consciousness and has recceived so much exposure that we often forget just how good it is.  Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" is one of these-- after spending most of high school listening to it endlessly and hearing material from it on the radio through college, I found myself burnt out on it.  Several years later, having pretty much abandoned commercial radio, I'm listening to \\"The Wall\\" today for the first time in at least a couple years. <br /> <br />What I'm amazed about is just how good it is.  All the criticisms about it are largely true-- Roger Waters went off the deep end, took the reins of the band totally and restructured their sound, its self-indulgent, the vocals are whiny, you can go on.  But one other thing is certainly true-- this is without a doubt the best work Waters did as a composer, and with the musical sensibilities of guitarist David Gilmour to keep him somewhat in check, its nothing short of brilliant. <br /> <br />The albums story is pretty well known, but for any new to it, I'll provide a brief summary.  Waters grew disgusted during a performance with a fan in the front row, focused a performance filled with anger on that fan, and eventually spat on him.  After the show, he declared the next time the band performed, it'd be behind a wall, and this story of isolation madness somehow came to him.  A boy (named \\"Pink\\") is born to a woman whose husband is away at war.  The father dies (\\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 1\\"), the boy ends up being raised by an overprotective mother (\\"Mother\\") and finds his creativity mocked and stifled in school (\\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\", \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\\").  This early section is somewhat autobiographical of Waters' childhood.  The boy becomes a rock star but finds no happiness and indulges in the rock star life (\\"Empty Spaces\\"), fueled primarily by copious amounts of drugs and women (\\"Young Lust\\"), and has a nervous breakdown (also biographical, this time of band founder Syd Barrett).  After a bit of time meditating on his life (\\"Goodbye Cruel World\\"), loneliness (\\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\"), an old pop singer (\\"Vera\\") and war (\\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\"), he gets drugged back to consciousness (\\"Comfortably Numb\\"), decides to inspire a riot (\\"In the Flesh\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\") and completely loses his mind (\\"The Trial\\"). <br /> <br />Ok, so its not exactly cheerly material, but its powerful-- from delicate beauty (\\"The Thin Ice\\", \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\", \\"The Show Must Go On\\") to slabs of raw rage (\\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 3\\", \\"In the Flesh\\") to passionate (\\"Hey You\\"), delicate and sad (\\"Goodbye Cruel World\\", \\"Nobody Home\\") and totally indescribable (\\"The Trial\\").  My suggestion-- don't start at the beginning, start on the second disc-- the first six songs are absolutely magical. <br /> <br />Is this for everyone?  Probably not, but its a stunningly universal album, given how bizarre its story is.  We've all felt isolated at times, we've all felt numb to the world, we've all thought we were losing our minds at one point, and we all wanted to lash out.  This expresses those feelings as perfectly as aything I've ever heard.  Highly recommended.
0140367357|1.0|CRITICISM: I doubt that I have ever met any girls sillier than Jane, or more cloying than Anthea. Indeed, I have never met any more cowardly than the two of them put together. They fulfill the worst stereotypes of silly little girls, and I balk at having them be heroines in this story. They cry and worry at their brothers for trying to fight. If they want to stop the boys in the long run, they should learn to speak sensibly, or let the boys go to it and be beaten up a few times, instead of snivelling for mercy to the enemy. Nesbit's narrator has some humorous moments, but is too much of a prude to run with them, retreating instead into sneakily-injected lectures on child behavior.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Five children meet a sand-fairy (called a Psammead), who is by far the most sensible of the characters in this book. From there, the book devolves into a series of events in the \\"and then this happened, and then that happened\\" style.<br /><br />COUNTER RECOMMENDATIONS: For elementary age fantasy, try any Roald Dahl (\\"James and the Giant Peach\\" is quite marvelous, as are \\"Witches\\" and \\"BFG\\"). Also try Cornelia Funke's \\"Inkheart\\" or, if lengthy books are still a bit daunting, \\"Thief Lord.\\"
B000002C1W|3.0|Perhaps an appropriately titled album, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" is obstinately listed as a Pink Floyd album, but with Roger Waters departed, the band is deprived of its primary songwriter, and the rest of the band (David Gilmour and Nick Mason, with Rick Wright not yet considered a member of the band but contributing) certainly is diminished without him.  Many people say that it isn't really Pink Floyd without Waters, that just as \\"The Final Cut\\" was really a Waters solo record, this is really a Gilmour solo record. <br /> <br />That may be true, Mason contributes no music, only performance, and given that the band's evolution took an abrupt about face from the previous album, this case can be made. <br /> <br />Consider this though-- its easy to forget, given the success and accolades of the '70s Pink Floyd material, that once upon a time, Roger Waters was in a similar position to Gilmour, contributing a song here and there, but not the driving or creative force, rather part of the mouthpiece for another genius in the form of original guitarist Syd Barrett.  And just as people say that Pink Floyd ceased to exist and that this album is a sham, they said that about \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\". <br /> <br />But more to the point, even if this is \\"really\\" a Gilmour solo record, its a pretty good album.  Yeah, it's no Dark Side or \\"Wish You Were Here\\" or \\"The Wall\\", and there's a bit of filler, but its a good record.  And it has at least one truly classic piece in \\"On the Turning Away\\".  Capturing a message Waters never tried for (as does much of the album), Gilmour's heartfelt delivery prevents it from falling into insincerity.  Also of note is instrumental \\"Terminal Frost\\" (in the classic Floydian vein) and the dark \\"Sorrow\\".  And yeah, \\"The Dogs of War\\" is the worst thing on a Floyd record in well over a decade and \\"One Slip\\" is a bit goofy, but it gets past that. <br /> <br />Not quite a classic, but not really to be overlooked either.  Check this one out when youstart to burn out on the classic Floyd material.
B0002OERI0|1.0|How this tripe ever won a Grammy, I'll never understand. It just goes further to prove how much of a farce the Grammys really are. I imagine that the majority of the Grammy voters never even listened to the CD. They just heard it was \\"against Bush\\" and decided to vote for it on that account.    Forget the political \\"statement\\" for a moment... the music itself is just re-hashed \\"pop-punk.\\" It's about as real punk as Avril Lavigne. There are no suprises or originality here.    The lyrics themselves are just prepubescent rants. They've decided to jump on the \\"Bush is bad\\" bandwagon and, in turn, have churned out some of the most pathetic lyrics ever put to music (if you can even call this music). At least some of the anti-Bush artists have been able to seem somewhat intelligent in their arguments. Green Day fails miserably in this respect.    I  liked some of Green Day's older material. However, they've strayed a long way from that. With American Idiot, they've proved that they themselves are the true idiots.
B000002A3T|2.0|Seven years after \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\", Pink Floyd released what appears to be their last album, 1994's \\"The Division Bell\\".  With David Gilmour and Nick Mason carrying on the name in the absence of principle songwriter Roger Waters on the last album, they appear to be bolstering their claim by adding keyboardist Richard Wright, removed from the band during \\"The Wall\\", to the fold.  His presence is more than propped up, he receives his first songwriting credit since 1975's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and his first lead vocal since 1973's \\"Time\\". <br /> <br />In addition to the return of Wright, this album thematically hearkens back to the past in its reliance on band history-- while \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" seemed relatively themeless and 1983's \\"The Final Cut\\" was about the failure of modern world politics, this one is about relationships, successful, broken and otherwise.  The lyrics mine not only Syd Barrett's place in the band's history, as did many of the truly great pieces the band wrote, but also Roger Waters' place as well.  Sadly, the songs that don't use this particular line of inspiration are lacking. <br /> <br />But we'll talk about the good first-- \\"Poles Apart\\" is superb, full of Barrettesque guitars and arrangement while exploring what appears to be the loss of both past band members.  Ditto for Roger Waters reflection \\"Lost For Words\\".  But the gem is the album closer \\"High Hopes\\", one of the best pieces in the Floyd catalog, regardless of songwriter.  Dark and haunting, with a brilliant gutiar solo and a great evocative mood, this song along makes the record worth seeking. <br /> <br />But the rest of it bounces between mediocre (the two instrumentals, \\"Cluster One\\" and \\"Marooned\\", \\"Coming Back to Life\\"), oddly out of place (pop song \\"Take It Back\\", bizarre loungy \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\"), derivative (\\"What Do You Want From Me\\") or gimmicky (\\"Keep Talking\\"). <br /> <br />Still, worth getting for the good pieces alone for a fan.  Anyone curious should check out \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", or \\"The Wall\\" first.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Okay. Hollywood-movies are to entertain and not to give an detailed account of what happened in the past. But the plot of this movie is simply ridiculous. Same style as in the war-movies of the 50s and 60s. The Nazis let themselves be slaughtered like cattle by the valiant Americans. <br />Also, the SF are far off the standards  which were already achieved by \\"das boot\\" 20 years ago. <br />This movie does not transport anything like e.g. claustrophobia; of the fear being trapped in a cigar made of iron in the middle of the Atlantic. It is simply about American heroism, not about the cruelties of war.  <br />In this movie the Americans achieve, what in reality was achieved by the Royal Navy. <br />This is not just another war-movie like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" with a fictional story in a historical setting, just another \\"change of reality\\"-style-movie. <br />I do not want to know how many people run around now, truelly believing that the Americans cracked \\"Enigma\\". <br />The whole Movie is not about action, u-boats, a part of the liberation of Europe or valiant deeds in war, it's just about \\"good guy\\" against \\"bad guy\\", in a manner that is called American \\"hurra patriotism\\" in Europe. Nothing against patriotism, especially the Americans often paid the folly of others in blood, and they have a right to be proud of what they achieved. But do the Americans have to be reminded of this right in such a crude (cineastic) manner? I hope, they don't.  <br />Shame on You, Hollywood!

0141439688|5.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.<br /><br />Gillian Beer writes a fascinating Introduction in this Penguin Classic Edition, in which she discusses Miss Austen's portrayal of the double-edged nature of persuasion. This complete and unabridged edition also contains a biography of the author, an Afterword, a new chronology and full textual notes.<br /><br />Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.<br /><br />The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.<br /><br />This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.<br /><br />JANAtackles, is just as germane today as it was when written.

0380807343|5.0|This book is very good.  It's creepy enough to make me want to keep the lights on and I'm an adult.  This book would make great reading material for a classroom reading time (even to those students who don't like to read).  It's never boring and gets right into things.  It's scary without being too much for school and could provoke great book discussions.  I would recommend this book for schools and individual readers alike.
B0009H1CK6|5.0|I bought this 'on spec' and was very pleasantly surprised. Some brilliant moments on this DVD, a real party where everybody is having a great time. Great video quality, fantastic playing amazing sound. It's great to hear a black r&b/funk band playing music without mention of 'hoes, bitches etc.'and no rap and scratch. <br /> <br />Special mention must be given to 'Sylver' for her fanrtastic voice also Omar Hakim on Drums. <br /> <br />Even if you do not like disco' buy this! Party, Party, Party!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard Rules, Rocks & Rolls. Get this Album! If you're a fan you'll love it! If your not you will fall in love I grantee. This CD Displays their hottest songs. Love Ballads, Heart Pounding & Foot Stomping material..You get it all!! We just saw them \\"LIVE\\" in concert again on July 3, 2005. Those boys haven't missed a step. They are in tip-top shape physically & musically. Their vocals are absolutely superb. LOUD Heart-pounding drumming & unbelieveable guitars. These British Boys are even better than 20 years ago. GET THIS CD. If it doesn't get you moving, you might as well be dead!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm not exactly sure what everyone's talking about. For the people who are giving this album one star because it was \\"dull,\\" what were you thinking? I would have characterized Coldplay as a mellow band, so I'm shocked that so many people were surprised by the slow pace in the album. Do you not remember \\"Yellow\\" or \\"The Scientist\\"?  I love all the songs on this ablum. Track #4, \\"Fix You\\", is amazing. It's the first song that all four members of the band have ever sung in unison. And, yes, that is a slow song but it picks up at the end. Some of the lyrics on this album are simplistic but that's kinda Coldplay's M.O. It's the music and (however cliche this sounds) the sincerity when Martin sings that makes Coldplay so appealing to so many of its die hard fans!
B000957O7S|3.0|Being a fan of both Wil Smith and Kevin James, I came into watching this one with a positive attitude, but was still pleasantly surprised at how (comparatively) good this thing was.  I say comparatively as most contemporary comedies, from the almost unwatchably bad \\"Meet the Fockers\\" to the banal \\"My Big Fat Greek Weeding\\" could have been written (and probably were) by monkeys at a xerox machine.  This one is a surprise, with a lot of good dialogue, mostly well-rounded characters and capable direction.  The plot is pretty contrived, and the ending is predictable, but the laughs are there.
B0002J51EY|5.0|this is sum 41's best cd and the three bonus tracks are very good and any sum 41 or non sum 41 fac should buy. and you should also join their fan clup at [...]. so buy this awsome cd
055357342X|3.0|I've read through some of the other reviews of the first three books of this series and I think it time to address a few of the most commonly cited complaints. <br /> <br />First: the sex. Yes, there is a lot of graphic sexuality in these novels. But, you know, there's a lot more warfare, fighting, murder and mutilation. These books are about warfare and political intrigue. If you're bound to be offended by anything graphically described, then these are not the novels for you as the pages are rife with blood and gore. Sex, in comparison, is kind of a friendly diversion even if it is described in terms devoid of romance and rose petals. If, on the other hand, you are offended by sexuality but not by graphic violence, then there are more pressing questions for you to consider than which fantasy novel to read. <br /> <br />Second: character deaths. Yes, there are a lot of character deaths. Too many? Not enough? Hmm... I'd say just about right. It keeps things healthy, to have cared-for characters die every so often: it keeps you on your toes. Also, given the aforementioned subject matter, war and intrigue, it simply wouldn't make sense not to have death now and again. Finally, there are so many characters and so many plots running around that death is a nice way of keeping things rather more in hand. I do have a complaint regarding the character deaths, however, which I will come to soon. <br /> <br />Third: the gray morality. Yes, the characters are round and multi-faceted. Everyone has virtues, everyone has flaws. (Well, okay, I'd be hard-pressed to find the virtues in some of them, like Gregor or Joff, but still...) But, you know, that doesn't mean that the characters can't be seen as heroic or villainous. Just because Hitler loved animals and was a vegetarian (which is true) doesn't mean he didn't have some rather defining characteristics. C'mon-you know who the heroes and who the villains are. And, while our opinions do sometimes change (Jaime's character, for instance, starts to change over the course of this book), the reason that they do so is not because there is no morality present, but precisely because there is. But here, I again have my own complaint, which I shall deal with presently. <br /> <br />Having dealt with the gripes of others, it's now time for me to develop my own. My problem with Martin's morality is that he makes it appear that, roughly, good = stupid. If there were a hard and fast rule in his world, it would seem to be that being an honorable person will certainly lead to pain, humiliation and death. Often, the problems that the more heroic characters encounter are of their own devise, and it usually comes from blindly trusting and acting honorably to the more villainous characters. And so, Ned warns Cersei of his discovery instead of immediately taking action. Robb releases Theon to his home. Rodik refuses to attack on Winterfell until too late, trusting in his enemy's honor (despite knowing his enemy to have none). Catelyn releases Jaime. Renly and Stannis refuse to attack King's Landing, again until too late. Loras pledges himself to Joffrey instead of striking him down. Cate and company trust Frey. Sansa trusts, well, everyone she shouldn't. Time after time, the heroes have the ability and the opportunity to win the day, and time after time they drop the ball and allow villainy to succeed. It has been said that all it takes for evil to win is for good men to do nothing. In this series, good men often surpass doing nothing by doing extremely stupid things to the advantage of the evil. And this is not to mention Tyrion, who is a heroic character completely enthralled to his villainous family and keeping them alive and kicking more than any other. The villains in this series would have no hope of winning at all if it were not for the active interference (sometimes unwitting), in their favor, of the heroes. It's like reading a big, adult Series of Unfortunate Events populated by several Mr. Poes who continually place orphans in Olaf's hands and refuse to hear their warnings (much like Ned dismissed Arya's warnings, just prior to his being arrested/decapitated). And that is a little frustrating, the difference being that this frustration is primarily what Snicket intends-I am less sure as to Martin's intention. <br /> <br />My second gripe, concerning characters deaths, as promised, is that: the deaths don't always seem to be part of some master plan. Sometimes, the deaths just feel kind of tacked on, either for shock or for \\"realism.\\" And, actually, this is part of a greater concern, the apparent lack of a master plan. As a for instance, way back in book one, you remember how Sansa's wolf, Lady was killed, and how that felt significant? As though, eventually, it would somehow matter that Sansa didn't have her wolf with her? Well... Sansa hasn't really gone through anything better or worse than any of the other Starks, and she's much more alive than some, including one who kept his wolf all the way to the end. It rather seems that Lady's death wasn't particularly significant. And that's the way a lot of the events feel including, sadly, character deaths. Again, this could be viewed as \\"realistic.\\" But I prefer it when realism is subordinated to drama-when fictional events seem to have form and shape and direction as opposed to the chaos and borderline randomness of the real world. When a character dies, I want there to be a compelling reason for the death, being as it is such an inherently compelling event. Martin sometimes seems to kill his characters out of a sort of whimsy. <br /> <br />My third and final gripe remains roughly the same as it was with the first two books and is, in a nutshell, this: too damned long. Forget the page count; Martin's writing is good enough to read for ten thousand pages, I mean that he's taking too long to get to the point. This third installment of the series ends in a quick succession of highpoints. It's meant to build interest and steam going into the fourth, which it does (frustratingly so, given the time between releases). But most of the third book, like most of the second and the first before it, are build up. Three thousand pages of build up are simply not welcome, and certainly not in the face of a projected three thousand to come. There was even a point, somewhere near page 600 of this book, where I started to question my investment. After all, do I have any assurance that the next book, or the book after, will offer any satisfaction? How long will I have to wait, exactly, for any sort of a sense of closure on anything? How good is Martin's heart? His cholesterol count? Blood sugar? I suppose, on the bright side, that this series helps a person develop their patience and endurance. But, I'll tell you, couple this with my doubts of Martin's having a master plan, and you have a potential nightmare in the making. Is it still possible that he does have a direction in mind, and that book six will end up with all of the strings neatly tied in a satisfactory bow? Yes-that's still possible. But the hope dwindles with every passing page. <br /> <br />In the end, I will continue. Onwards to book four, I say, and quick about it. Frankly, I may have invested too much to turn back, now, no matter what happens. But I'm punishing Martin with one star less on this novel than I'd awarded the previous two. The book has the same quality as the others in the series, and the last fifty pages or so are rather exhilarating (and the scene with Sansa building the castle in the snow is just awesome-the kind of thing Martin must have had planned for a long time), but the slight problems become large over time, sort of like Malcolm's explanation of fractals and chaos theory in Jurassic Park, or something. Unabated, these problems will choke him all the way down to a single star by series end. I only pray it doesn't come to that.  <br />

B000002U82|5.0|Let me start off first by saying that Dark side of the moon has been around since 1973. DSOTM delt with the topics of life such as time, money, war, mental illness, and death. Those very topics are still around in the current time we live in. I am 16 yrs old and this album has really changed the way i feel about music. What ever B.S people say about this album being a stoners cd is not true. I haven't done a single drug in my life and this album gets me into natural high, a natural high that no other album can match. I can come home from having a bad day and pop this cd in and after that 42 minutes and 57 seconds experience I will feel on top of the world. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to any music lover out there that hasn't experienced this wonderful album. All you parents out there should share this album with your children because they will be thankfull of it in the future. We must keep DSOTM alive forever. <br /> <br />

0671027387|2.0|This is the only Dan Brown book I have ever read and I was extremely dissappointed. My cousin who is a big fan of Brown suggested him to me and I picked this book up for a quick read. After having read this book I feel it would be hard to take his more prominent work seriously. This book suggests to me that Brown is little more than another fervent conspiratorialist. Even though it is a work of fiction I was hoping for some realism instead I was faced with decent writing style about a completely implausible plot. Brown continually forces action into a dry story not by a logically connected series of events but by the repeated irrational decisions of characters. Characters in the book repeatedly rely on and are blessed with extreme luck. Even when one character gets the upper hand they take inconceivable risks. I gave this book a two only because my opinions on this book are probably somewhat based on my overly high expectations.<br /><br />Yet another problem with this book I feel to be worth mentioning is the lack of original characters. Brown fills the story with cliched (not sure how to make the accent) and stereotypical characters. Take for instance: A strong willed independent and intelligent woman with a take control attitude but a discordant family life, an egotistical power hungry politician with substandard ethics, a quirky yet genius scientist, a handsome debonaire, smart, and charming TV personality, and a chain smoking secretive and crass political advisor with questionable yet extremely effective methods of advancement for her particular candidate. The list goes on but I realize that I already just made a horrible run-on sentence with a flagrant use of commas so I'll stop there
B00000JPYD|5.0|robin trower may be the most overlooked great guitarist in rock and roll history. he was cursed to be the \\"new hendrix\\" and yet he gave so much more. <br /> <br />this album is a must-have, harkening back to the days when you only released an album when you had enough great songs to fill it. i find the guitar work on \\"lady love\\" to be right there with SRV's \\"texas flood\\" as my all-time favotire riffs. every time i play that cut i wish he had let it run on. this album is so tight he would have none of that. <br /> <br />and, i'd like to offer my condolences to everyone who loved this music on the passing of james dewar. what a beautiful voice he was!
B000002KHH|5.0|the cd is awsome! planet caravan is one of the darkest sounding songs especialy with ozzy's voice its awsome!
B00005JKG5|3.0|I came across this  interesting tidbit about \\"Flashdance\\":<br /><br />\\"Not all of the dance scenes for Jennifer Beals (I) were performed by Marine Jahan. The scene where she auditions and does the spin on the floor was actually performed by a male breakdancer from New York.\\"<br /><br /> A male bodydouble for a female dancer? In a *nationwide* search, you couldn't find at least one pretty young woman who could act  *and* dance?  Anyway, the movie is enjoyable due mainly to the dancing. Other than the that, it's kind of cheesy and  there are too many gaps in it. It's not as cheesy as \\"Honey,\\" though, and I do have to give Jessica Alba props for doing her own dance numbers. And in case you're wondering, yes, Pittsburgh was really that dirty in 1983 and it's still dirty in 2005. Avoid this dirty, boring place like the plague.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and haven't seen it in several years.  I recently bought dvd and couldn't be more pleased.  Not only was I able to enjoy the movie again but it included the making of the dark crystal which was extremely entertaining.   <br /> <br />I have two daughters who both also love this movie.  I do not see anything wrong with letting children watch this.  Yes, it is darker than Sesame Street but it is a great adventure story.  <br /> <br />I would like to add my commment about the supossed \\"rape scene\\" comment that was left.  This person obviously doesn't know the meaning of the word rape or they did not pay attention to the movie.  The \\"rape\\" the person is talking about is the banishment of one of the skesis.  The skesis has lost a battle and is stripped of his clothes and banished by the other skesis.  Calling this \\"rape\\" is a gross misrepresentation of the word and I feel makes one think the movie would be unsuitable for children. <br /> <br />Overall this is a great adventure movie with an exciting plot that is great for the whole family.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I didn't waste my money seeing \\"Hulk\\"  at the cinema, but I sure did waste my money renting it! \\"Hulk\\" has to be the most boring film ever made. I mean, the movie was so boring, that my brother and I couldn't even crack jacks at it. My brother eventually fell asleep, but I forced myself to stay awake until the end. Why the heck did I torture myself like that? Anyway, \\"Hulk\\" sucks big time. Hardly no action and just a bunch of jumping over mountains and deserts. Family Movie Night was ruined!
0141439475|5.0|One of the most popular novels ever written, \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" is one hell of an engrossing read. I read this novel in preparation for the 1994 movie of the same name, starring, produced and directed by renowned Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh (\\"Henry V,\\" \\"Dead Again,\\" [a murder mystery]<br />\\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" \\"Othello,\\" \\"Hamlet\\"; see my reviews on all of them). The part where the monster was describing his travels made me sympathetic towards him, while making me feel repulsive towards Frankenstein, but I found that I could sympathize with both characters, though on different levels.  I LOVED IT!! I look forward to seeing the movie. Rated PG for thematic elements.
B000051VWW|2.0|I'll never forget the day that \\"Lovers Rock\\" came out. I had finished all of my finals and it was time to sit back and chill. So I go to the CD store to get \\"Lovers Rock\\" and then I went to Subway to get a meatball sub. So I go back home, put the CD in the stereo, and, let me tell you, I lost my appetite. I love all of Sade's music, but \\"Lovers Rock\\" is her most awful work ever and wasn't worth the wait. Out of the 11 songs on the CD, I only like 2: \\"All About Our Love\\" and \\"Lovers Rock.\\" Everything else is slow, dull, and pretty much sucks. I mean, you can't even  jam or get into a groovy mood. It's pretty much something  the Geezer Boomers would listen to. Anyway, I sold \\"Lovers Rock\\" and I don't miss it one bit. To all of you Sade fanatics, \\"Lovers Rock\\" is one CD that you wouldn't even want to add to the collection. TRUST ME.
B00000637V|5.0|There are some artists/albums/songs that are way ahed of they time. Those artists/albums/songs don't get much atention and respect when they were relised, but with time their influence and impact became to obvious to be ignored. Lou Reed is one of those artists and Berlin is one of those albums. Lou Reed began his career with the legendery NY band Velvet Underground, wich also didn't had great success thanks to the band's much darker and unpleasant style compared with popular bands of that time. After four albums with V.U. ( now considerd timelles classics) Lou Reed left the group to start the solo career. He found more sucsses then ever with his seckond solo efort \\"Transformer\\". Produced by die hard Velvet's fan David Bowie, album was a giant seller thanks to the classic single \\"Walk On The Wild Side\\". Unlike most artists in his situation, Reed decided to make a completelly different follow-up, risking his newly gained popularity. On this new album, Reed got back to his dark \\"Velvet's\\" roots, only this time he got even deeper in the absolute bottom of human's psyche. <br />Album failed to sell, thank's to not relising any singles ( wich is easy to understand). Already on the begging of the first (and title) track it becomes obvious that Lou wasen't thinking about record sales while making \\"Berlin\\". On first six tracks Lou Reed is more in the angry mood and frustrated on the situation then on the later numbers when he becomes more of a viewer of tragic events that he describes. This gives album more concept than most pepole realise. During the album, Reed covers themes like: poverty (Lady Day a tribute to Billie Holiday), social differences (Man Of Good Fortune), desperation (How Do You Think It Feels),woman abuse (Carolline Sais II), single mothers (The Kids) and suicide (The Bed). <br />Album slowly goes to the finale with \\"Sad Song\\". Sad Song is probably the happiest song on the album, it begins after the scary ending of \\"The Bed\\" with the beautiful flute part wich leaves the impression of light at the end of the tunel. Sad Song leave us with the conclusion that life is a sad song but that we shoud stop wasting our time with trying to figure that up. <br />Truly a glorious ending for a glorious album. Lyrically, \\"Berlin\\" is Lou Reed's peak and it's just as good and meaningfull as you can get. Steve Hunter and Dick Hunter play the guitar on the album, and will both be Reed's playmates on future relises. Legendary Jack Bruce plays bass on most of the songs, and equally legendary Steve Winwood plays organ and harmonica. This all gives \\"Berlin\\" great musical aragments. All in all, \\"Berlin\\" is an underrated gem of rock music that deserves a place in any music collection. <br /> <br />
B00092ZL80|5.0|I was at this concert last night, in Atlantic City N.J.  What a concert! These groups still sound great, after 30+  years of performing! Most impressive to me, was Philip Bailey  of EWF! His voice is still incredible! I got to meet him, and  Verdine White after the show, and got pictures with them, and  autographs! (YEAH!) Just buy this concert, it's very good, and  the sound quality is tops! (Thanks, Brenda and Evan!)
B00081U7HC|3.0|I was terribly disappointed with the other version (10th) as it had scenes in the actual movie that weren't & made it a disappointment to me & friends.... DVDs can offer choices of adding deleted scenes...... a couple scenes ruined the whole movie for me.  If this version can guarantee the theatre release version - I'm for it...
B00005U8EM|5.0|I don't have any particular comment regarding the special edition because I have the original DVD release, I am just logging in this review because I want to jump in the band wagon.  You can mention this movie or make allegorical references to it  during family get togethers,  in the breakroom or when things are kinda slow at work and you will always get a favorable response and then everyone starts mentioning their favorites scene or what they would do if they get stuck in a time warp.  Until now, I haven't found anyone that has anything bad to say about this movie, so it is safe to say that it has achieved a cult status, I think we can all agree on this one.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Okay, for all of you who are whining and moaning that this movie was too violent or that the women in it were all whores (they may have been prostitutes but look how freakin' strong they are, they don't take crap from anyone as is obviously shown in the alleyway scene!) I have one question for you: What did you expect when you went and saw it?! All you have to do is look at the title of this movie, it's called SIN City, it's not gonna be some stupid G rated Disney movie! I obviously Loved this movie, it was so different (and as we all know sometimes that's a Bad thing!) but it really worked, I've never read the comic books but I loved it all the same, the acting is good, the stories are interesting and exciting and it's just beautiful to look at. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I saw this movie 3 times.  It's an incredible movie and is worthy of all the praise it can get.  The acting and directing is top notch.  Also the story is great.  Can't wait to see Bale and Nolan again in a few years.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Alright guys, here's the deal. Liking something because it's underground and no-one has ever heard of it is all good and well, and I have nothing against the people who really don't want this band going mainstream, I'm one of them. My reasoning behind this seems to have not been explained, so I will state them. I've been with Gerard and the boys since early 2004, right after the release of the new album. Before I'm Not Okay, before Helena. I loved the music because it was emotionally drawing and I felt I could really identify with it. Plus it sounds great. I have NO PROBLEM with people getting into this band because of the Helena video, or the I'm Not Okay video, all the better for the band. I do however, have a problem with all the people who tell me how god awful this band is then they get popular on MTV and everyone starts liking them. If you're going to like a band, do it because you enjoy the music and because it connects with you and makes you feel whatever it is you're trying to feel at the time, not because it's what everyone else is doing and you want to act like you know what you're talking about. Anyways, on to the review. <br /> <br />Helena - 9.5/10 - Great track, beautifully done, introduces the album very well. <br /> <br />Give 'Em Hell, Kid - 10/10 - Excellent track, if you know what he's saying it's actually very interesting. Great sound, wonderful song all together. <br /> <br />To The End - 9/10 - Not as good as the previous two tracks, but still a great song. <br /> <br />You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison - 10/10 - Wonderful addition to the CD, one of my favorite tracks. Kinda weird sounding, interesting lyrics..but that giggle at the end gets me every time. <br /> <br />I'm Not Okay - 8.5/10 - It's really not a bad track, just overplayed. Good song though, nothing like the rest of the CD. <br /> <br />Ghost of You - 8/10 - I don't really know why, I just don't click with this track. It's not bad, I'm just not a fan of the way Gerard sings on this song. <br /> <br />The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You - 8.5/10 - Not a big fan of this one either. Not much to say about it. <br /> <br />Interlude - No rating here, just a filler, doesn't count. <br /> <br />Thank You For The Venom - 10/10 - Excellent song, very fast paced and great guitars at the beginning and throughout the song. Drumming is nice too, and the vocals are fantastic. <br /> <br />Hang 'Em High - 9/10 - Didn't really like this song the first few times I heard it, but it definately grew on me. Great track <br /> <br />It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish - 9/10 - Another great song, well done. <br /> <br />Cemetery Drive - 10/10 - A very haunting song with great vocals. A personal favorite. <br /> <br />I Never Told You What I Do For A Living - 9.5/10 - Great song with a very interesting verse late into the song.
1400034779|5.0|The writing style is simple, yet there is great depth within the stories.  Alexander McCall Smith is an excellent story teller, with the capability to make one fall in love with his characters.  If you are looking for some light reading, this is a find.  If you are looking for something which will make you introspective, again, this is a find.  One of the best reads I've had in a long time and I'd consider it a modern day classic.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  I was told it's a classic and I loved it!
B000002ITM|5.0|This album, in my opinion, is Testament's best one.  It came out when I was 10 years old (yes, i was into this stuff at that tender age).  And now, 13 years later, i can still put this cd on and love every second of it.  The tracks are very original, and Alex Skolnick really shines on his guitar leads. <br /> <br />Highlight tracks are \\"As the Seasons Grey\\", \\"The Ritual\\", \\"Deadline\\", and \\"So Many Lies\\". <br /> <br />This album is, without a doubt, Testament's most dynamic album.  It captures the heavy side and the melodic side perfectly.  Testament is an awesome band across the board, but they shine the greatest on this album. I highly recommend it.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Not sure how I missed Nightwish (this is their 5th album in 10 years), but having heard \\"Once\\", I'm a fan of theirs now. Tarja is perhaps a Sarah Brightman (\\"Phantom Of The Opera\\") wanna-be in disguise. Tremendous pipes that can go up and down at the raise of a hand. Trained in opera - how did this girl hook up with heavy metal? No matter - it's happened and we're better off for it. The backing vocals are equally impressive - and haunting in a Damien \\"Omen\\" kind of way. Emppu's guitar absolutely shreds - heavy, raw - riffs that just won't die. Solid drums, steady bass work and glorious production. Finland must be proud - Nightwish is now hailed as their best rock act in recent years (might I go out on a limb and say \\"ever\\"?). Who do they sound like... style falls into the gothic, majestic, power, classic metal. Bands that come to mind in the same category might be Symphony X, Stratovarius, Hammerfall, Kamelot or even some old Golden Earing (\\"Twilight Zone\\"). Vast orchestral movments, operatic voice, and crunchy rock guitars with heavy drums. Some of these beats sound familiar - remember that macho German outfit Rammstein - downright catchy industrial tunes that you could probably march the troops to. After listening to all of \\"Once\\", it left me wanting more. The first half of the disc is rocking in-your-face metal. The 2nd half Nightwish hits the brakes a tad. As good as track 2 is (their biggest hit \\"Nemo\\"), there are some slower tunes that are simply beautiful (\\"Siren\\", \\"Ghost Love Score\\", and \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\") - showing the band's range and versatility. This album took me by surprise and now I find myself looking in all the stores for their other releases. ** I bought \\"Once\\" when it was first released (11 tracks). Look for the re-issue with 2 bonus tracks - 13 total tracks including \\"White Night Fantasy\\" and \\"Live To Tell The Tale\\" - definitely worth the extra price!
B00068CVJ4|5.0|Don't bother getting that new &quot;System Is Non-Operational&quot; cash grab.Buy this album instead.Every song is true ATDI style and the whole CD is amazing.This CD will change the way you listen to prog-rock.
B00003CXXP|4.0|This film is very very good, regardless of what some people have said. <br /> <br />Speilberg has been criticised for scmalzing up everything he touches, but I don't think that is the case here.  This film has depth and imagination on a grand scale.  The last forty five minutes or so are amazing and the ending is fitting and satisfactory. <br /> <br />
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Definitely one of the best cd's i've heard in a long time.&quot;Burnin Streets&quot; is my favorite track.What a great album all around.
B000025XKM|5.0|Nick Drake has become the darling of the soundtrack set. His songs have been used in the films \\"Serendipity,\\" \\"Garden State,\\" \\"Dream With the Fishes,\\" and \\"The Royal Tenenbaums,\\" as well as in a Volkswagen commercial. Pretty amazing for a guy who achieved no real commercial success while he was active and has now been dead for over 30 years.    \\"Pink Moon\\" was the last album Drake recorded. It's a haunting experience to listen to it now with the benefit of hindsight, knowing that the artist was only a couple years from taking his own life (though many will argue whether his death was a suicide or just an accidental overdose). According to Drake's producer/engineer John Wood, \\"Pink Moon\\" was laid down late at night over two evenings in early 1972 and featured almost no overdubs. The tracks average roughly two minutes in length, and the whole thing clocks in under half an hour, but the brevity and immediacy only add to the emotional impact.    The more complex arrangements that marked Drake's first two albums, \\"Five Leaves Left\\" and \\"Bryter Layter,\\" are gone. What remains are Nick's soft, wistful voice, his guitar, and a little piano piece on the title track. The album is drenched in loneliness, disconnection, and the hard-earned advice of someone who was learning the difficult lessons of a world with which he could not cope. It is also dotted with signs of Drake's desire to depart this life; the four-line lyric to \\"Know\\" sounds an awful lot like a goodbye note. At the same time, tracks such as \\"From the Morning\\" reveal someone still able to find beauty and hope around him, even if he was only finding it for others and not for himself.    I'd single out other songs, but \\"Pink Moon\\" is a collective experience; the perfect essence of folk music and a sorrowful portrait of a young man in the grips of an emotional state that he could not master as he mastered his art. I think few would argue that the best music is honest and offers us a look inside the performer. \\"Pink Moon\\" certainly meets that description, providing a window into an injured soul. At times it's almost painful to listen, but at the same time it's too magically beautiful to turn off.
B00008NG5V|4.0|You will love it, as you will love his new album In Between Dreams.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I love SAW! It had a micro-budget and just over two weeks shooting time! How many recent \\"horror\\" movies have come and gone, costing zillions of dollars and taking months to complete, only to stink up our theaters? I like it when unknown directors come along and give us movies that ignore the hollywood formula of $$$ + HYPE - ORIGINALITY = $$$$$$. SAW -like Night Of The Living Dead, Dementia 13, Carnival Of Souls, Spider Baby, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Donnie Darko, May, etc.- beats the incredible odds against it, set by a mindless industry. SAW actually held my interest throughout, and genuinely shocked me at the end. Remember how the ending in SE7EN made you feel? I sure do, and SAW made me feel that same wonderful mix of dread and amazement! The creators of this film have taken the usual killer / multiple victims scenario, and added mystery, actual suspense, and a monumental twist unlike any in recent memory. Any flaws -questionable acting / dialogue, etc.- can be easily excused considering the aforementioned budget and time constraints. Just watch it and enjoy it...
0385503954|5.0|This will be a short review, as I will leave a description of the plot and characters of the novel to others.  What I want to focus on is the writing on display here.  Ian McEwan is able to get inside the head of several characters expertly.  He lays out their wants and desires like a master.  He enables us to see how their bias allows them to view events and other characters so differently.<br /><br />The fulcrum of the novel rests on a unknowing false accusation of sexual assualt.  Once the character learns of their mistake, then we see the theme of the novel come into focus.  Is it possible to atone? To seek forgiveness? Shall it be granted?<br /><br />The final section of the book, taking place after most of the characters are dead nearly fifty years in the future, heartbreakingly offers few answers.<br /><br />I read this more than a month ago, and it still haunts my thoughts now and then.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00008O0WN|2.0|A lot like a simple episode of ST-TNG, only sillier... here are just a few examples:<br /><br />At the start of the film, we have a ridiculous wedding scene between Riker and Troi, and then a bunch of dumb jokes about a followup nude wedding on Betazed.<br /><br />Fairly early on, Picard, Data and Worf come across a disassembled early version of Data - and he just happens to have aged exactly as Data has aged... this makes absolutely zero sense - except, of course, that they don't have the special effects to be able to have B4 be like a young Data, which would have made sense.<br /><br />Then, for some reason, the Reman Viceroy can penetrate Troi's thoughts... and when all appears lost in the battle sequence, Troi FINALLY figures out she can penetrate his thoughts to pinpoint the cloaked ship, and guides Riker's hand at the controls (CORNY!) - why doesn't she just do it herself.<br /><br />Near the end of the film, Picard (but ONLY Picard mind you), beams over to the Reman Scimitar - and then sparks fly out of LaForge's control panel, and he declares that the transporter is down.  This scene is worse than anything from an actual episode on TV.<br /><br />The stupidest part of all has to be the exceedingly lengthy time that the Scimitar's \\"secret weapon\\" needs to charge up - but, of course, the universe is saved at the last second... ho hum.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|So, I've been with these guys since being a teenager in the 1980s.  Through the years they remain a hallmark of their style and have really transcended trends along the way.  This is a great review of them as it has easily been 10 years since I've seen them live myself.  Slane is a great backdrop for a live concert and the band and crowd vibed well together.  John F. became a critical part of their sound from Mother's Milk onwards and it is nice to see him taking his place and hitting his stride.     I don't think any one player shines above the rest in this performance.  John F. is great, but he is well-placed against the fine talents of Flea and Chad.  Recall that John was a fan who got a shot at being in the band 15 years ago.  Look how far they've come.    I heard snippets of Black Sabbath and the Clash in their interludes, but I didn't hear any Fugazi as one other viewer suggested.  At this price, I think this DVD is totally worth the effort and represents a band with just as much energy and drive as ever.  I reckon the RHCPs are coming up on 20 years.  I can see them at 30 years easily.  Its nice to see that Rock and Roll can sustain us even as we age.
6305327041|4.0|\\"Four Rooms\\" is far more entertaining than you would expect from its generally negative reviews. Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed \\"Love American Style\\" on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. It was made between the time Tarantino made \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and worked on \\"Dusk Till Dawn\\" with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four stories:    \\"The Missing Ingredient\\" - Madona has simply never looked better and her \\"come get me\\" dress will burn your eyeballs. Alicia Witt plays her stock alienated teen and delivers sarcasm as only she can.    \\"The Wrong Man\\" - Alexander Rockwell directed this segment shortly after directing \\"In the Soup\\" so he already knew how to get the most out of Jennifer Beals. Her diatribe about Ted's sex organ is a cinema classic.    \\"The Misbehavers\\" - Rodriquez directs his favorite actor Antonio Banderas in something that is a throwback to classic Laurel and Hardy. Not only do his two kids misbehave when left alone in their hotel room, but their misbehavior is so comprehensive that the closing shot reveals a room of total anarchy. It is wonderful slapstick on a huge scale, with comic timing worthy of the Laural and Hardy and the Marx Brothers.    \\"The Man From Hollywood\\" - This has the best script with Tarantino reserving the best stuff for his own character. He even reprises the \\"tasty beverage\\" line from \\"Pulp Fiction. Beals has already found her way to this room by the time bellboy Roth arrives and she delivers more good lines. I was impressed that Tarantino built up his suspense \\"before\\" the contest began and then did not try to extend the suspense but ended things on the first attempt.    The best bit in the whole film might be Roth's phone call to his boss. Marisa Tomei answers the phone in a room full of comatose post-New Years Eve partygoers. She then does a version of her \\"My Cousin Vinnie\\" expert witness routine, this time concerning types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious (but totally stoned) inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen, holding the controller but not using it, as the other player maniacally manipulates the other controller throughout the entire phone conversation.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000002MY3|5.0|I first really became infatuated with Alanis when I heard her 2002 song -Hands Clean-. I then forgot about her for a while and then picked up this album.<br /><br />Jagged Little Pill was a huge success for Morissette selling about 30 million copies worldwide. Basically the only albums that have sold to this magnatude are -Thriller- by Michael Jackson & -Come On Over- by Shania Twain. Jagged Little Pill was portrayed as a very angsty album when a radio DJ stumbled upon \\"You Oughta Know\\" and discovered the f-word in the song. Originally before that the album had debuted at only #118 on the Billboard 200, but then the rest is history.<br /><br />The album has the perfect blend of dynamics and the timbre in her voice is phenomenal. The album has some softer tracks that are incredibly different to the trademark Alanis tracks.<br /><br />\\"All I Really Want\\" is the opening track and Alanis at her loudest, this track is so cool that no words can really describe it. It has really nice guitars courtesy of Glen Ballard and Alanis blows damn hard on that harmonica. \\"You Oughta Know\\" is the track that made this album famous. At first I didn't recognise the verses, however the chorus seemed instantly familiar, like an old friend, I don't know why.<br /><br />\\"Perfect\\" is a real tear-jerker and the first time I heard it I seriously nearly cried and I'm not really that emotional. Her voice is raw and naked on this track and simply outstanding.<br /><br />\\"Hand In My Pocket\\" is really awesome and I love the vibrant tempo and how she uses her superb vocal range to her advantage.<br /><br />\\"Right Through You\\" is Alanis getting angsty at record company executives. The lyrics are so good as it describes a person very vividly and fully. \\"Forgiven\\" is full of raw emotion and energy that I can feel Alanis channeling. I don't know what the topic is about though.<br /><br />\\"You Learn\\" is another track where you feel like you are in heaven and Alanis is serenading sweetly to you. I like the chorus the most because it is extremely well structured.<br /><br />\\"Head Over Feet\\" is a really nice love song which could be a perfect anthem for couples.<br /><br />\\"Mary Jane\\" has that trademark Alanis emotion infused in it and I do really wonder who Mary Jane is. \\"Ironic\\" is Morissette's most comercially successfull single to date and the lyrics are really ironic and witty and I like them.<br /><br />\\"Not The Doctor\\" is another classic from Alanis and has a fresh sound, how can she make songs so good? \\"Wake Up\\" is the song where Alanis tells us exactly what to do, to wake up. This song is good because it is empowering and has a moral.<br /><br />Overall Jagged Little Pill makes for one of the best albums in the history of man and the universe. It's exciting, fresh and varied. Morissette has a knack for words and writes her lyrics incredibly well. So I highly recommend this album to any music fan.<br /><br />NOTE: Track #13 is just an alternate take on \\"You Oughta Know\\".like the chorus the most because it is extremely well structured. <br />\\"Head Over Feet\\" is a really nice love song which could be a perfect anthem for couples. <br /> <br />\\"Mary Jane\\" has that trademark Alanis emotion infused in it and I do really wonder who Mary Jane is. \\"Ironic\\" is Morissette's most comercially successfull single to date and the lyrics are really ironic and witty and I like them. <br /> <br />\\"Not The Doctor\\" is another classic from Alanis and has a fresh sound, how can she make songs so good? \\"Wake Up\\" is the song where Alanis tells us exactly what to do, to wake up.

B00018HULS|4.0|Are you kidding? Sia is totally her own thing, and that thing isn't pop.    \\"Breathe Me\\" was Six Feet Under's swan song.  Also,  if you like Zero 7, this album is a slam dunk. Click on Buy Now, right now.     If you're not quite sure what this Zero 7 thing is, then don't despair. Sia is a sweet, wispy voiced woman who sings songs like she ACTUALLY understands the meaning behind them. The songs are simple, not over produced and hooky. And this is one of the albums you put on and let it play, rather than single laden. Beautiful morning music.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I have no idea why people keep trashing this movie.  <br />No, of course it doesn't stick to the comic book. This might be because this is a movie BASED on a comic book, and it is obviously not meant to be a faithful translation.   <br />I thought the opening scene was awesome, as well as the mythologies put forth in the film. This film makes great use of the character in the HellBlazer comic, and flips him to make him more accessible without taking any of his edge.  <br />As someone who has read the comic book, I can say that this movie is Original and exiting in it's own right. <br /> <br />It really annoys me when people complain and say the same  \\"It doesn't stick to the comic book/novel/video game/play/whatever this movie is based on\\" thing, no matter how interesting the movie is regardless.  <br />These people should just be banned from all theaters and flayed to death.  <br />For those people who actually like movies, and have some semblance of an open mind, you will enjoy this film. <br /> <br />Peace! <br /> <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|I won't lie; I bought this CD for the single \\"Somewhere Only We Know.\\"  However, I ended up loving every track.  My two favorites are \\"Bend and Break\\" and \\"Bedshaped.\\"  Every track has amazing lyrics, and of course the vocals, piano, and drums are excellent together.  What is really wonderful is that you can understand every word without having to look at the lyrics, which I credit to their lack of guitars.  If you like the album, SEE THEM LIVE.  It's even better, and because there aren't any pesky guitars, you can still understand every word.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|A true depiction of high-school life in 1990s midwest America, Napoleon Dynamite is the closest thing to a real-life hero I've ever seen. Highly recommended for anyone tired of hackneyed heroes and cliche drama.
B000089RVR|5.0|I originally heard of Dido from the sound track of \\"love actually\\".<br /><br />One day when I wanted someting new to listen to, something fresh and a good value for the dollar I went into the back of K-mart to the discount CD rack to look for a (one new) CD.<br /><br />As I browsed the rack, I came across this album (not the enhanced version mind you) and took a chance hoping that some of the songs were as good as the track on \\"love actually\\".<br /><br />I purchased it, took it to the car and put it in the cd player. Some of my friends have asked me if I own any other CD's (which I do) but I just can't eject this one from the player - It is that good. I got the value I was looking for and you will to if you purchase this CD. Every song is great.<br /><br />Get her \\"No Angel\\" CD as well. I often trade one for the other, rarely does another band get playing time now that I have Dido in my collection.<br /><br />She and this CD has rocketed to the top of my favorites list.
1591396190|4.0|For a real treat, couple up your reading.  Flip between Seth Godin's \\"All Marketers Are Liars\\" and this book, \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\".  Overlay both with \\"Don't Think of An Elephant\\" by George Lakoff.  Different styles and similar messages make all three books better reads  --  and can begin to explain why Seth Godin isn't the only one out here calling for marketing and innovation that has authenticity and integrity, no matter how \\"edgy.\\"
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Very Funny Movie, but not the funniest.  Puppets are made very well and facial expressions are great.  People that don't like this movie either have no sense of humor or a fan of Alec Balwin.  They were probably trying to find Dirka Dirkastan on a map.  Great movie to watch many times even if you're ronery.
B00000272N|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen,this is the debut of the influential band, Alice In Chains, and is quite possibly one of the greatest debuts by a band ever. The music on this disc is incredible, and undisputedly METAL.(Despite what many grunge losers say...)In 91', when this disc was released, the alternative/grunge scene was in its infant stages and so Alice In Chains was lumped in with the likes of Nirvana, Soundgarden, etc.However Alice predated these bands and bears no resemblence to any of them. ALL of their music is dark and dreary and Layne Staley's voice is powerful and very distinctive. On this album their  musical focus is  blatantly Metallic-i.e. the distortion is razor-sharp and the drums and grooves are tight. These songs rock with a bleeding vengence. The lyrics (like all of Alice's lyrics) deal with death, drugs, depression,isolation and failed, twisted relationships. So a definite 180 from the \\"hair\\" metal era of the mid to late eighties,  but interpret the lyrics what you will. <br /> <br />Perhaps the greatest facet of Alice in Chains is their mastery of \\"mood metal\\". These songs are heavy as all, but evoke very dark and brooding atmospheres.That being said,  it's better to listen to it on head phones to get the full effect. <br /> <br />The most noticeble songs off this disc are the grooving and dark \\"Man in the Box\\" which some say deals with censorship and the media, and the brief but powerful,\\"We Die Young\\", which is about the debauchary and self destructive behavior of 80's youth-particulary rock stars. However all the songs are highlights. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt Alice In Chains' MAGNUM OPUS, and sadly, a prelude to dissapointment, as their music would get steadly more mediocre with each succesive release. Get it, it truly is a powerful piece of  work.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This is a very good movie. The story is good, the characters are solid, the fighting and effects are good and I liked it. They have a lot of talking in this movie as well. It isn't just some all out action movie with no words at al, which is common in superhero movies. I think this is the best superhero series there is. Overall, I'd say its even better than X-Men, which was another solid superhero series that I personally enjoyed. But enough of the good and in with the bad. The action sometimes looked fake, and they made it too obvious that the scenes where he is swinging on the webs are fake. Also, the Green Goblin costume wasn't very well designed, and looked like something more from Zoolander. But it was still a good movie. So if you like superheroes, or if you just want to see an unsually good action movie that has more to it than just plain action (such as love, friendships, and struggles for power) than this is the movie for you. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested. It is good.
068987474X|5.0|I became intrigued by the title of this book since I first heard the phrase on SATC. When I learned it was turned into a book, I became even more interested, and I'm really glad I read it. <br /> <br />Do not expect to find serious research or a \\"how to\\" on finding the right guy. What you WILL find in this book is honesty, reality, and a good sense of humor. The authors are really onto something here. Their bottom-line is to get women to stop sitting by the phone, stop tolerating not being #1 in their guy's life, and to stop making excuses for the simple fact that he is not the dreamy man they want to make him out to be. That can be hard to accept, but I think it is totally liberating. Both authors do a great job: Greg lays out the painful truth, and Liz offers a very sincere and heartfelt female take on that truth, which ALL women can relate to. <br /> <br />I am a very recent newlywed, but my single days are still very fresh in my memory. So I know what it's like when you actually meet the right person. The difference is like night and day. No mixed signals, no waiting by the phone, no ambiguous BS, no \\"trying to figure him out.\\" <br /> <br />It's infuriating that a man (some men, not all) will make a woman go through so much stuff simply because he's just not that into her, but also doesn't have the guts to let her go and move on. And it's also infuriating that we can't change that. But, if women are quicker to catch on to this behavior, imagine how much freer they will be! <br /> <br />So single ladies (or even if you're off the market), do yourselves a favor, read this book with an open mind and good humor. You won't regret it.
B00005JMEW|3.0|This a pretty good movie and it had A LOT of blood. However, it did not have enough depth. They could have added some more to the movie but it was alright anyway and it makes you want to watch the sequel. The movie did have some good fight scenes though. Overall it was pretty interesting to watch so if you are looking for a good action movie, this is a good one to see. However, warning, this is not for the faint of heart. There is much blood and gore.  But if you don't mind watching someone getting their head chopped off and then seeing the blood spill out of their lifeless body then by all means this is the movie for you. By the way all of the blood looks extremely fake and seems to be made the same way the blood was made for the comic book scenes. What a pity.
6305212112|1.0|This movie was entertaining up until the end, which I felt was totally unbelievable. It ruined the whole thing. I hate movies that let you down at the conclusion. It makes for a rotten feeling, like you've been betrayed. This, and another movie I can think of, \\"Two Mules for Sister Sara\\", left me with the same bad vibe. Lousy.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix Revolutions is a tough movie to score. First you have the greatness of the first two films to take into acount. If you judge the movie as an individual film, it is by all means great. The acting was great, visuals were awesome, and the direction was at its best. I do not consider myself a stupid person, and am not stupid. I have legitimate reasons to dislike this movie. While it is supposedly great because of it symbolism, that is not what the Matrix trilogy is trying to achieve. It is not a religion, it is a set of three films. Taking the first two films into acount, the third is pretty bad. While Revolutions answers many questions, it does not answer those from the previous films. Revolutions is more of a Matrix supplement than a real ending. Sure Zion is save, Smith is destroyed, and peace is achieved, but all the build up from the first two movies is lost. It is as if they made this movie to some two prequels that I've never seen. This film departs from the Matrix roots, and stumbles because of it. While in the first two films most of the dialogue was in riddles, this film makes up totally new riddles to answer. Take the general idea of this movie and separate it from the trilogy to get a great movie, but stick it into the Matrix, and it becomes strangely out of place. They should have done better to conclude the trilogy, but since I have no power to change this I shall have to be satisfied with it. To bad we shall never know how deep the rabbit hole truly goes...
0393317552|1.0|Jared Diamond writes in a flowery, redundant style that makes the book about three times as long as it should be. Besides that, and more importantly so, Diamond glosses over major holes in his theory that require an astute eye to catch. Though Diamond's presentation of geographic determinism contains interesting information, it ultimately caves under itself as Diamond consistently brushes away the idea that culture had anything to do with regional success, choosing instead to embrace the notion of continental diffusion axes, and at a point, the shape of coastlines (the latter of which indicates some of the outrageous claims in this book). \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" sounds reasonable at times but as a whole is remarkably far-fetched. This book is a prime example of how one should be taught to examine everything with a skeptical eye, otherwise the reader will convert to Diamond's skewed view without ever realizing the fallacies he presents.
B00005JN0T|4.0|his was a great movie. Take a murder mystery and put thirty-one years into the future and you will get I, Robot. From the very beginning this movie is fast-paced and it never slows down. Most would think that this means a poor plot. However, this movie has an execellent story line and is very much like a mystery. Also, the robots were very well made and their lack of humanity was shown well. Of course, there was an exception. One robot, named Sunny, had dreams and behaved almost like a human. This made the movie even more interesting. Detective Spooner (Will Smith), had a tough time convincing the people that the robots could not be trusted. This added to all of the good things. Simply put, this was a great movie. The only negative side was that it was a bit short. It sort of seemed squished together. They could have added a little bit more running time to elaborate just a touch more. Aside from that, this movie is excellent. Definitely a must-see.  <br /> <br />4.5 stars but Amazon doesn't have halves. :(
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|2 1/2 stars <br />Overall, this is a decent album. For the genre, it is definitely one of the better, most diverse cds around. Either the guys from SOAD are musical geniuses, or just good at making things work. Most of the songs are incredibly interesting musically, particularly Radio/Video, which features screaming metal, polka, and hints of Jamaican influence, all one after the other. Somehow, the transitions are fluent and interesting to listen to, which hides the fact that it's a terrible song. I love it. I'm not sure why, but SOAD is very good at writing terrible music and performing it incredibly well, so we fall in love with bad music. People I've talked to agree, it's pointless music that is impossible to stop listening to. Simple, repetive, catchy melodies make SOAD's music very interesting to listen to, not to mention incredibly hard to get out of your head. <br />musicfishreviews.blogspot.com
B00005JMAH|3.0|This was a  good movie. However, it would be a little difficult to understand for those that don't know much about Harry Potter. Mr. Cuaron did an excellent job in this movie and he really captured the dark feeling of the movie. Many scenes had a scary touch to it, but the best scenes like this where when the dementors come in. You can tell that happiness is being taken out of the scene. Unfortunately for big Harry Potter fans there may be some disappointing parts in this movie. Some rather important scenes are omitted and Quidditch is pretty much ignored. It seems that they have forgotten that it was in this book that Gryffindor finally won the Quidditch Cup. The finals are not in the movie at all, and the fateful Hufflepuff match is just a scene where Harry falls off his broom. The result is also ignored. Also, Harry receives the Firebolt at the end of the movie rather than for Christmas. There were also some other minor things like these missing as well. The movie start off good but it gets to Professor Trewlaney's prediction is just an hour and twenty minutes. From there you have to watch another hour of the last few chapters of the book. The conclusion was far too streched. Overall, it was a good movie, but it may be a bit disappointing for huge fans or people looking to learn more about the Harry Potter world.  <br /> <br />3.5 stars but Amazon doesn't have halves. :(
B00005JMYI|3.0|I caught this one on HBO over the weekend and I laughed hard at least a dozen times, which is exactly about a dozen more times than I thought I would. Will Ferrell is getting a little annoying to me the more I see him in films (loved him on SNL), but he gave me a few chuckles in this one. I loved all the cameos and some of the dirty humor, but this is one you won't want to see more than once or twice.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This movie had potential. Unfortunately, it didn't use it. The beginning of the movie was great. It had a fast-paced storyline and it had some interesting things in it. The story was very good at first. They had several twists and shocking discoveries which made things interesting. I was really into the movie up to the part where Celine (Kate Beckinsale) runs in to save Michael (Scott Speedman). At that point the movie adds extra twists which are totally unnecessary and becomes very confusing. Also, the story gets totally lost among the twists and becomes just a movie where two people are uselessly fighting. The character Craven just disappears even though he seemed like a rather important character. The werewolf leader, Lucien, just dies without any fight and the connection between him and Craven remains unexplored. To make things worse the movie just cuts off rather than concluding. Point is, it is a good movie until the conclusion. This movie would have been better off being a cliffhanger.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I'll keep this brief.  Musically, the record is great.  If you like the Foo Fighters, go and buy this but the whole copyright protection thing kills it for me.  Didn't they say that when you \\"legally\\" bought music, you owned it?  Why is it then that in order for me to rip this to my PC \\"legally\\" I now have to go to itunes (or a similar online music store) and, purchase it again.  I know there are work arounds for this issue but after I already own the CD, why should I have to go through the trouble?  Acts like this will just push people further to illegally download music in the end.  I can see what the Foo Fighters were trying to accomplish here but the execution is poor and the only people they are hurting is their fans.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Alright. Some part were worth it, some weren't. The beginning was very slow paced and boring. If had something else to do, I would have abandoned watching the movie after the first 20 minutes. Luckily, as time went on, it got better. The transformation of Max's character was very well done and the plot actually wasn't bad, it just provided some boring scenes. The conclusion was easily the films best part. It became a fast breath-taking chase in a skyscraper as Max raced to rescue a woman that he had driven in has cab earlier from Vincent. Had the whole movie been as well done as the last thirty minutes it would have been spectacular. Overall not bad but it could have been much better. And by the way, after the club scene, how did all the cops just forget about them and disappear?
B0009I7NNA|1.0|A7x used to be one of my favourite bands and now with this new release, they have gone all metal influenced and no more core. Theyre metal core shown in Waking the Fallen was by far one fo the best cd's that i have ever heard. I was so dissapointed with this new release that i might even sell it back to the wherehouse. I know that M.Shadows will go mute in 6 years if he does not stop screaming, but they could have at least made one final good cd, i doubt that tim lambesis would ever stop screaming.
B00005JNJT|5.0|After several disappointing Batman films, this one truly begins the good Batman films. It had a great and entertaining story line, good acting, and very good visuals. Sure it took a darker approach to Batman, but it paid off and created a very exciting, edge-of-your-seat Batman. It does the Black Knight justice. <br /> <br />The start of the film explores who Bruce Wayne was before he became Batman and even shows his parents' death. The beginning is great, but the movie takes off in the batmobile when Wayne returns to Gotham. That's when the fun starts. Great scenes of Batman busting bad guys and driving around in his \\"tumbler\\" keep you entertained. There are nice twists, a great ending, and even some remotely scary scenes. Add that with well placed humor and good acting from Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, and Morgan Freeman and you have one great movie.  <br /> <br />Nothing is as cool as seeing the Batman logo projected in the air over Gotham, except Gotham itself, and Batman in action, and Scarecrow in action, and and and I could keep on going, but it will take to long and I don't want to spoil anything. Point is, after summer flops like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Fantastic Four, Batman Begins is easily the best movie of Summer 2005.
1563894696|5.0|When I heard Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb were going to be involved in a 13 episode Halloween story, I couldn't picture how they were going to make it work. They worked together on the `Halloween specials' for Batman with awesome results, Halloween stories with the Mad Hatter and one of my all time favorites `Ghosts' based on Dicken's `A Christmas Carol' had shown to be suitable for them to work on.<br /><br />I never had the chance to read any of the 13 numbers until I bought this edition. Since the moment I got it, I have re-read so many times and never get tired of doing so. This is for me one of the best Batman stories ever, worth of being together with the `Killing joke' and \\"Arkham asylum'<br /><br />The most important villains are present over the entire story, each role is well defined and the characters are well treated. This is basically the beginnings of Harvey Dent as `Two Face' (we get to see his origin here) and the `Holiday' killer.<br /><br />The story is so compelling and all the characters motifs are well defined but not shown until the shocking ending of the story.  The `Holiday' killer always leaves a holiday present at the crime scene; those are the most unbelievable pages I've ever seen! Tim Sale's style has always been one of my favorites, the killing scenes are so well drawn and told that they could pass for a movie sequence; they are told and shown in a very cinematic style.<br /><br />Throughout all the chapters the mystery of who the `Holiday' killer is remains, all the characters involved want to know who he is and all are suspects at the same time, you will not know where to look at until you get to see on the last chapter the shocking identity of the killer.<br /><br />A mob story with Batman's most popular villains, a mysterious killer, one of the best teams in the comic industry... what else can we ask for?
B0001HLVS2|1.0|This was a very unclear movie. There was very little information from the communication of the characters and I could not understand why they needed to chase that ship. Also, it's all very stretched out. Only about half the scenes needed to be in the movie. It was also very boring and had very little excitement. In the end it seemed that the captain was fooled and started to chase the ship again and then it just ended. They should have deleted the useless scenes earlier and made the end a bit better. A waste of time, don't watch it unless you really, really want or if you're a Russel Crowe fan.
B00009Y3L4|4.0|\\"Cabaret\\" is about a young lady named Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) who performs at the Kit Kat Club every night, but dreams of becoming a famous actress. She meets a British tutor named Brian Roberts (Michael York), and they instantly become friends, then lovers. It takes place in 1931 Berlin, just when the Nazis are gaining political power. The performances in this movie are all incredible; Liza was perfectly cast as Sally, and Michael York is wonderful in his role of Brian. Joel Grey is just disturbing and brilliant in his portrayal of the Master of Ceremonies, the role he originated in the Broadway production of \\"Cabaret\\". Most musicals have the characters all break out into unified song and dance, but not this movie; all musical numbers are (cleverly) performed in the Kit Kat Club, making it very realistic indeed. The only song not performed in the club is \\"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\\", a chilling song sung by a group of Nazis and patriotic Germans. It starts off with a young man singing, and he eventually leads the surrounding Germans into singing the song with violent nationalism. All the musical numbers are excellent, and are all different in their own ways. Bob Fosse's choreography is also excellent. The only problem I have with the movie is that, upon first viewing, I didn't really like it much. But some of the songs grew on me, and I watched it again; now, it's one of my favorite films of all time. I highly reccommend this movie, although it may take two or three viewings to truly appreciate it.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|Overall this was a good movie. The special effects were great, the action was intense, and the plot had potential. Unfortunately this movie is hurt by a rushed ending and some unfinished parts. Van Helsing apparently has forgotten about his past, and this a great addition to the movie and adds some suspense. However, the movie never got into at all and completely ignored it at the end. This would have added some more excitement. Also, the conclusion of the movie is so brief you dont notice it. Characters die (won't spoil it for those that haven't seen it), and its over. After 2 hours of preparation they should have made the end worthwhile. Still, overall this is a good movie and seeing it isn't a bad idea.  <br /> <br />
B000055Y0X|5.0|Black comedy and satire this film has it all.  There are just to many really funny lines to write about from this film.  All the acting is over the top and some of it hits disturbingly close to home.  Watch for Peter Sellers in several different rolls. All in all a very enjoyable film.
B0007Y08I8|4.0|This movie was surprisingly good. First of all it was very funny, and filled with bad language. But what else can you expect from the creators of South Park? The most amazing thing about the movie was that it actually had a storyline which was quite complete and didn't leave any blanks which some movies tend to do. Second, it had some twists that kept you hooked. It was a great idea to make the Film Actors Guild (FAG) act on the side of the bad guys. And it was impossible to stop laughing at a bumbling puppet of Matt Damon who couldn't say anything but his own name.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This is the Greatest Album EVER!!!! Better than anything the beatles ever released...YEAH!!!!

6305897786|5.0|Wow.  What a ride.  The ending will only be disappointing to you if you don't pay close enough attention.  It was a brilliant chiller of an ending.  All the signs are there, although individually quite subtle.  I almost missed it.  Watch the movie again and look at the engraved plates with an open mind, every time they show them! <br /> <br />This film left me with tons of food for thought, and oh yes, it's beautiful eye candy.  Gorgeous actors, luxurious sets, and if antique books turn you on... oh, baby.
0385510438|3.0|I love Grisham. I've read every one of his legal novels. I'm not sure what this was. Of course, he always writes well. But this was a meandering discourse on life in the old south as it meets the New South. The crime and trial were a mechanism to muse on the old south and its colorful characters and folkways. OK if that's what you want.  Great descriptions of southern cooking and answers the question as to why there is more obesity in the south.
0156027321|5.0|There are books and then there are masterpieces. Life of Pi falls under the second category. It is a story about Pi, a sole survivor, who manages to survive 270 days at sea with a Bengal tiger by the name of Richard Parker. Yann Martel has managed to create a story that is unparalleled and one that transcends all possible limitations of human imagination. It is an outstanding story of courage and endurance in the face of extraordinarily difficult and tragic circumstances. The underlying theme of the book is that `if you have the will to survive, you will'. Those who believe that the art of allegory is moribund are in for a big surprise.
B000002UJQ|1.0|I bought this CD because everyone told me.  This was the biggest waste of my money ever.  Try as I might, I couldn't even make it past track three.  After some futile skipping, I resigned myself to being a sucker to \\"popular opinion.\\"
B00005JLTN|4.0|Non-demanding fans of the original The Matrix will likely be enthralled by the second installment in the series. More demanding aficionados will likely have a few reservations, some of which will not be addressed until the release of the third feature, Matrix Revolutions. I fall into the latter category. Although there are things about The Matrix Reloaded that I like, the movie is so open-ended and riddled with gaping holes that it's virtually impossible to view this as a finished project. Writing this review makes me feel like I'm putting pen to paper after seeing only half of a motion picture. At this time, I recommend the movie for what it is, but I reserve the right to revise that opinion in six months. It is possible - perhaps even likely - that the shadow of Matrix Revolutions will be so long that it will fundamentally impact the effectiveness of The Matrix Reloaded.<br /><br />The biggest problem with The Matrix Reloaded is that it is not a complete film. Moreso than other, recent multi-segment movie sagas (The Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future 2 & 3), this picture has a truncated, incomplete feel - as if the ending is intended as nothing more than an intermission for a five-hour spectacle. That will be fine when the entire trilogy is available for viewing, but, in the summer of 2003, it represents an impediment to full enjoyment of what the Wachowski Brothers have offered.<br /><br />It has been four years since The Matrix reached screens, but, in the machine-dominated universe, only six months have elapsed. During that time, in large part due to the efforts of the messianic figure Neo (Keanu Reeves), the small human population inhabiting the hidden city of Zion has grown. The machines, taking notice of that growth, have decided to put an end to humanity. While the leaders of Zion prepare for war, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) takes Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) back into the Matrix to confer with the Oracle (the late Gloria Foster), hoping to learn how to fulfill the prophesy that will save mankind. While there, Neo encounters some new adversaries - such as the deadly-but-suave Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his seductive wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci) - and an old one - the indefatigable Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is literally beside himself.<br /><br />The Matrix Reloaded delivers what a segment of the viewing audience expects - visually dynamic action sequences separated by interludes of wordy, often pretentious exposition. The only real intellectual titillation comes at the end, when the storyline lurches forward in a moderately unexpected direction. One of the best things about The Matrix is that it was smart as well as visceral. While it's not fair to call The Matrix Reloaded dumb, it's not on the same level as its predecessor, at least as far as intelligence goes. The movie's characters often pontificate about choice, fate, and causality, but, once you delve beneath the sheath of cryptic language, you discover that they're not saying much that's new or interesting.<br /><br />There isn't much in the way of character development. The three protagonists are pretty much as we left them four years ago, although Neo has grown into his powers to the point where he's virtually indestructible within the Matrix. He's Superman in black, with no Kryptonite in sight. That limits the adrenaline level of his action sequences, since there's never any sense that he could lose a battle. When the fight involves Trinity and Morpheus, however, that's a different matter. These two are decidedly vulnerable, and therefore represent Neo's Achilles heel.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves looks so good in Neo's gothic costume that it almost doesn't matter that he's not much of an actor. He's a great icon around which to design a bunch of special effects and he doesn't trip over his dialogue. (Not that he has much...) On the other hand, if you're looking for a hero to bond with, Neo's not the best choice. Reeves' underplaying, whether calculated or not, distances him from the audience. On the other hand, both Moss and Fishburne hold their own, with the latter repeatedly commanding the camera's attention. Hugo Weaving, taking a break from playing Elrond the Elf, brings his wonderfully dry wit to the part of Agent Smith. Lambert Wilson oozes false charm, and has the film's best one-liner (I won't repeat it here, but it has something to do with French cursing). Monica Bellucci is wasted, but she still looks great. Jada Pinkett Smith has a small role as Niobe, an ex-flame of Morphius' who now captains another ship.<br /><br />While some viewers will be disappointed with the movie's inability to constantly engage the intellect, few will be anything less than awed by its eye candy. If there's one area in which The Matrix Reloaded tops The Matrix, it's in the visual effects department (not a surprise, considering the budgets of the movies). This is a great looking motion picture. Darkness abounds, and the Wachowskis take full advantage of its atmospheric possibilities, with nearly every scene transpiring in locales where man-made lights fight a losing battle to hold back the shadows. There are some amazing shots in and around Zion (including an Engineering room more elaborate than anything in Scotty's wet dreams), and some Terminator-like views of the machines as they go to work. And the climax to the film's centerpiece action sequence - a lengthy, convoluted car chase - is breathtaking to behold.<br /><br />There are, of course, a large number of fight scenes. These include some relatively \\"simple\\" (and not terribly energetic) ones - Neo fighting a few agents, Trinity trying to survive a vicious onslaught, Neo \\"proving\\" that he's \\"The One\\" to a skeptical guardian, etc. But there are also three big ones. The first involves an elaborate confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith that ends with the Superman in black tangling with a small army while performing all sorts of gravity-defying stunts and using an iron pole as a baseball bat. (All that's missing is Vin Scully or Harry Kalas doing play-by-play.) The second has Neo stopping a lot of bullets in the \\"usual\\" way, then fending off a dozen or so bad guys. Then there's the car chase, which comes close to re-inventing the worn-out action staple. This isn't the usual, boring one-guy-chases-the-other-until-someone-crashes sequence. It goes on for a very long time, through various permutations, until it concludes with a literal bang. Good stuff, and worth the price of admission, even for those who are normally lulled to sleep by car chases. (Count me in that category.)<br /><br />When The Matrix was released in 1999, it was not expected to be a big hit. Its stunning success surprised nearly everyone, including Warner Brothers. It cost about $60 million and grossed nearly three times that domestically. The video release widened its audience and increased its popularity. Production delays have meant a longer wait for the sequel than anyone intended, resulting in a Matrix feeding frenzy. As always when expectations are this high, there's bound to be a level of disappointment. Whether it becomes the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time or the biggest movie of the summer is of interest only to those who view box-office results like sports scores. On balance, The Matrix Reloaded does an admirable job of filling the niche it's supposed to - that of an action-oriented science fiction adventure. Only time and Matrix Revolutions will determine if the material contained here is just a noisy, visually lively distraction or whether there are deeper currents we're not yet aware of.playing, whether calculated or not, distances him from the audience.

0375701427|5.0|Sometimes a book comes along that I just seem to sink into.  It is rich with detail and subtleties.  It is a story of an individual as well as a story of human nature. Its prose is beautiful and intellectual.  And the theme enriches a place and a time with which I am familiar.  Philip Roth's 22nd novel is such a book.  It won a Pulitzer Prize.  And I can well understand why.<br /><br />This is a story about the American dream and the turning point in the late 1960s when protests against the Vietnam War were escalating.  And it is the story of the effect on one family when their 16-year old daughter commits a violent act of terrorism. But this book is more, much more than this seemingly simple story.<br /><br />The very structure of the book broke a lot of rules.  There are more than 80 pages from an aging narrator who sets the stage.  He's in his 60s and attends a 45th reunion of his high school class of 1949.  The depth of detail here introduces Newark, New Jersey, which was a Jewish neighborhood in those days. It was these children's grandparents who immigrated to America, fleeing the pogroms in Russia.  Their children grew up working hard and prospering.  And their children seemed to be living the American dream.  Then things changed.  Especially for the family of Merry Levov.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a bunch of recollections.  Their order seems haphazard.  They explore the father's thought processes.  It gets deeply inside his mind and we see how he thinks.  There are long passages in which no actual action happens other that the character's thoughts.  Usually I don't like passages like that.  But in this book I got so into them that I felt real emotion and found myself feeling little gasps of recognition for certain human emotions that were exposed by the careful crafting of the author's words.<br /><br />The family relationships are complex. And each character became real to me with all his or her flaws and inconsistencies.  I felt I knew these people, and I literally not only understood, but sensed instinctively, just who these people were.<br /><br />Mostly, it is the father's story.  His nickname is \\"the Swede\\".  He's Jewish, but never looked it and excelled in sports in high school. He did a short stint in the marines in WW2 and then came home to marry Miss New Jersey, a young working-class Catholic woman.  He works with his father in the glove business and I found myself completely fascinated with the actual details of this business - from animal skins, to tanning to cutting to stretching to sewing to marketing to just plain running a business.  The young interfaith couple buys an old stone house in an upscale area where there is enough land for the wife to raise cattle.  They have a daughter named Merry who seems to be happy.  Then Merry becomes an adolescent. And soon their lives are filled with sorrow.<br /><br />Some of the themes seem straight out of Greek tragedy.  And yet the characters are completely modern.  They are deeply etched and troubled.  And I related to them all.<br /><br />There are no easy answers and there is a melancholy feeling throughout.  The ending is inconclusive.  But instead of being disappointed in this open ended conclusion, I found it ultimately satisfying.  This book is a masterpiece.  That's why I give it my highest recommendation, especially for deep-thinking book lovers.ew these people, and I literally not only understood, but sensed instinctively, just who these people were.  <br /> <br />Mostly, it is the father's story.

B00000K19E|5.0|There's no sophomore jinx for the Wachowski Brothers. Andy and Larry, a pair of obviously talented film makers, have returned to theaters with The Matrix, a science fiction thriller that is every bit the match of their debut effort, Bound, for tension, excitement, and intelligence. In an era when movie scripts (especially those pigeonholed into the science fiction genre) are becoming increasingly more stupid and special effects reliant, the Wachowskis prove that style and substance do not have to be mutually exclusive.<br /><br />I loved The Matrix. The movie is kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind-bending. It toys with the boundaries between reality and fantasy in unique and interesting ways. In its approach and content, it reminded me of last year's vastly underrated Dark City. There's also a synergy with two movies due to be released within the next month: David Cronenberg's eXistenZ and Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes. The Matrix is undeniably science fiction, but, unlike most pictures claiming that association, it never falls into the boring, expected patterns of space battles and laser gun shoot-outs. Instead, it ventures into territory that, while not virgin, is sufficiently interesting to provide an involving, invigorating backdrop.<br /><br />Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is leading a double life. To most people, he's a hard-working computer programmer who holds down a nine-to-five job for a major software corporation. But, in the privacy of his home, he's a hacker named Neo who is \\"guilty of virtually every computer crime [there's] a law for.\\" Neo is dissatisfied with his existence, and, while he's groping for a meaning to it, he is contacted by a mysterious computer presence known as Morpheus. \\"Wake up Neo,\\" a printout on his monitor screen reads. \\"The Matrix has you. Follow the white rabbit.\\" And so begins an amazing odyssey for both Neo and the audience.<br /><br />It turns out that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is the captain of a small space ship, and he believes that Neo is a messianic figure. When the two finally meet, Morpheus explains to Neo that all is not as it seems. The reality he is used to is a fabrication, the product of a sinister race of intelligent machines that use human beings as power supplies, to be discarded at will. Neo is dubious, and Morpheus sets out to show him the truth. Soon, he is learning how to manipulate the Matrix: a computer-generated dreamworld built by the machines to control human minds. But danger lurks ahead for Morpheus and his small band of followers. The goal of the machines is to eliminate all free humans, and their most powerful weapons, the Sentient Agents (who look like Men in Black), are closing in. Led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), their goal is to capture Morpheus and pry the secrets from his brain.<br /><br />There's much more to The Matrix than this, but to explain further would be to reveal plot twists better discovered through viewing. Although the film frequently toys with the blurred line between grim reality and computer-generated fantasy, it rarely leaves the viewer completely confused (except, perhaps, at the very beginning). The Wachowskis have carefully structured the story in such a way that the audience is capable of following the action and understanding what's going on even when all of the secrets have not been revealed. Nevertheless, because The Matrix is intelligent, it will defeat those unwilling to invest some intellectual participation. The payoff is worth the effort.<br /><br />Stylistically, The Matrix is much like Bound. Both films are visually stunning, with images painstakingly constructed and action sequences choreographed to excite the eye and quicken the pulse. The Wachowskis use a varied pallette that includes shadows, slow motion, quick cuts, and offbeat humor to paint a unique portrait. Like in Dark City, theirs is a grim world, where darkness and gloom seemingly always hold sway. Everything from the set design to the costumes (lots of black, lots of sunglasses) is intended to contribute to an overall look. When it comes to shoot-outs, the Wachowskis show that John Woo isn't the only director capable of doing interesting things with familiar devices. The shots of Keanu Reeves streaking down a hall with guns blazing all around him and the air thick with shattered bits of concrete is only one of many snapshots that lingers in the mind's eye long after they have vanished from the screen. The special effects, which are not as numerous as those in many science fiction pieces, are flawless.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is not generally regarded as a strong actor, but, given the right part - one that doesn't demand much subtlety or emoting - he can be effective. His role as Neo fits the criteria. The Matrix needs a leading man who can look good, act cool, and not stumble over his dialogue, and Reeves is three for three.

When it comes to shoot-outs, the Wachowskis show that John Woo isn't the only director capable of doing interesting things with familiar devices. The shots of Keanu Reeves streaking down a hall with guns blazing all around him and the air thick with shattered bits of concrete is only one of many snapshots that lingers in the mind's eye long after they have vanished from the screen. The special effects, which are not as numerous as those in many science fiction pieces, are flawless.    Keanu Reeves is not generally regarded as a strong actor, but, given the right part - one that doesn't demand much subtlety or emoting - he can be effective. His role as Neo fits the criteria. The Matrix needs a leading man who can look good, act cool, and not stumble over his dialogue, and Reeves is three for three.

B00080ZG10|2.0|I was disappointed with this film.  I expected more.  After all, it won a lot of academy awards.  It was directed by Martin Scorcese and had lots of star power.  It also was the life story of Howard Hughes, the eccentric millionaire who built airplanes and made movies.  The trappings for a great film were all there.<br /><br />I just wish I could have felt some sympathy for the emotionally tortured Hughes.  As played by Leonardo Di Caprio, the character seemed a caricature. Whenever he tried to show emotion, he just crinkled his forehead.  As the film went on character aged the makeup people made that forehead crease deeper and deeper.  This just is not substitute for good acting.  Cate Blanchard did her best to act like Katherine Hepburn.  But, alas, there are too many real Katherine Hepburn movies around and we've all seen the genuine article.  Blanchard  tried hard. But there was no doubt she was only playing a role.  I have the same comment about Kate Beckensale, who tried to play the role of Ava Gardner.  Her performance just didn't work.<br /><br />I found the story interesting but very predictable because of course I've heard of Howard Hughes.  No money was spared for the cinematography or the sets.  And even though the film was almost three hours long, I was never bored.  I might have even liked it if it wasn't for all the hype about it. And I think it would have been a better film if it were totally fictionalized and not try so hard to be about a real person.  This is the most overrated film of the year.  And, in spite of it's reputation, I can't really recommend it.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix Revolutions represents a disappointing way for the science fiction trilogy to bow out. Overlong and underwhelming, The Matrix Revolutions reinforces the thinking that it's a rare movie series in which the final chapter is the strongest. In this installment, the intelligence and ideas that formed one of the cornerstones of the original The Matrix, and were still in evidence in The Matrix Reloaded, have been shunted aside in favor of computer-generated action that makes about 1/3 of this movie look like a video game on the big screen.<br /><br />The problems with the film are easy enough to pinpoint. It's pretentious (this was true, at least to a degree, of its predecessors) - we're expected to approach this film with the same solemnity that the Wachowski Brothers do. The action is hackneyed - the slo-mo martial arts stuff was neat the first time, but it was already getting old by the time it was re-used in The Matrix Reloaded. Now, it's past the expiration date, and the Wachowskis fail to come up with anything genuinely new or innovative to enhance or improve upon it. The pacing is uneven - the first hour is bogged down with talking and unnecessary exposition; not until the half-way point does the energy level shoot up. And the payoff is weak. Had this been a stand-alone popcorn science fiction adventure, it might have been enjoyable, but this is a poor way to end a trilogy. Expectations built up by the first two films are not fulfilled. One could be forgiven for anticipating something more momentous than a long shoot-'em-up followed by a glorified fistfight. And the \\"twist,\\" if it can be called that, is hardly earthshaking.<br /><br />The Matrix Revolutions begins where The Matrix Reloaded ended - with Neo (Keanu Reeves) in a coma after defeating a few sentinels. Actually, his mind is stuck in a sort of limbo (that looks like a train station) between the Matrix and the Real World. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) go in after him, and are forced to make a deal with the annoyingly cultured Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) to retrieve him. Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), has found a way to escape from the Matrix in his unending quest to eliminate Neo. The machines are about to finish off Zion, and Lock (Harry J. Lennix) is running out of options. Morpheus, Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.), and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) decide to return to the human city, but Neo and Trinity believe their destiny lies elsewhere. So, with the fate of mankind riding on their shoulders, they head in an unexpected direction.<br /><br />In recent years, the line between special effects-focused blockbusters and computer games has been shrinking, and The Matrix Revolutions further narrows the gap. All that's missing is a joystick on the theater seat arm rest. The battle for Zion should be tense and suspenseful, but the obviousness of the computer generated animation during these sequences damages the ability to suspend disbelief. I didn't ever believe that I was watching humanity's last stand. Instead, I felt like I was watching a non-playable demo for a Matrix Revolutions videogame - shoot down as many sentinels as possible before being overwhelmed. The human element is limited to a few familiar faces rather than legitimate characters we actually care about.<br /><br />After playing Superman for the last movie, Neo is back to being merely mortal this time around. That makes for some degree of uncertainty about his fate, but, unfortunately, it also requires that Keanu Reeves attempt to do more than stand around looking bemused and cool in black. The Matrix Revolutions expects Reeves to act a little, but the moment he tries to show emotion, we have to fight back giggles. Sadly, Reeves isn't the only one to display acting deficiencies. His co-stars, Carrie-Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne, are on auto-pilot. Moss tries (and fails) to make us believe that Trinty truly, madly, deeply loves Neo. Fishburne had little to do except look stern. The only ones with any real energy are Harold Perrineau Jr. and Jada Pinkett Smith, neither of whom has a lot of screen time. The gorgeous Monica Bellucci (as Persephone) is so underused that it's inappropriate to label her appearance as anything more than a cameo, with her cleavage getting most of the attention. There has been one casting change: the enigmatic Oracle is now played by Mary Alice, replacing Gloria Foster, who died during production of The Matrix Reloaded.<br /><br />When The Matrix Revolutions works, it does so as eye candy. Although the first hour drags because of the pontificating about choice and fate (none of the speeches offer anything new), the second hour zips by. The battle sequences may not be as involving as those in, say, Star Wars, but they are done with enough technical savvy to retain the attention of most viewers. And those who are on hand just to see a big-budget special effects extravaganza will be satisfied. Anyone hoping to experience the blend of science fiction, philosophy, and edgy action that characterized the previous two movies will be disappointed. Nevertheless, for completists who need to find out how it ends, The Matrix Revolutions provides answers (although not necessarily to all questions) and doesn't cop out when it comes to the final resolution.to do except look stern.

B00011D1RC|4.0|This is a very memorable movie that you can feel and even touch it. imagine that you are going to a vacation. 1 week to a hotel. you may probably find some friends there. a week of peace or adventure. and after it's over, all people go their ways. but the memories remain. for example after 2 or 3 years you come back to the same place, you'll not enjoy again. memories bothering you! and that's exactly what happened to me when I whatch 1945 remake! it was in no way could be compare with magnificent 1932 original movie! grand hotel had one of the best cast selection I've ever seen. Actings were awsome! and the atmosphere of the movie was magnificent. hope the story was more sophisticated and the if movie could last one more hour! this movie really needs a good remake. not only a remake! a good one! with accurate cast selection and more sophisticated story. anyway I admire it and love it! Quality of the DVD was magnifecent too! very bright sound and picture quality for a 73 years old movie! I loved it! Really loved it!
B000002UAU|5.0|Often when an album is highly celebrated and exalted as this album is, the music can find it hard to live up to the hype. Not so with Sgt Peppers; this is an album that deserves the praise it has been given <br /> <br />IT is impossible to underestimate the impact this album had. Those of us that weren't alive in 1967 when this was released (and that is probably most of us), can find it hard to appreciate what Sgt Peppers would have sounded like in the context of mid/late 60's rock music. A lot of people that were alive though, if you ask them, will tell you how Sgt Peppers was so different from what had come before. Rock music before Sergeant Peppers was 2 dimensional; capable of excellence and brilliance, but it wasn't 'epic' and it wasn't 'art'. Sgt Peppers opened the door to music being just that. Its production and arrangement was incredibly innovative. It sounded so new and original then, and it still does now <br /> <br />My dad tells a story of speaking to a 'DJ' (possibly when such a title did not imply unintelligence) when Sgt Peppers had just come. This person told him in no uncertain terms that the album was the best thing he'd ever heard by anybody. The effect of this album on music as a whole, then, has been incredible <br /> <br />The songs themselves are very worthy of this. While it is probably the album as a whole, its production, effects etc that people were most impressed with, the individual songs are also brilliant. You probably already know them. The title track is a wonderful upbeat song, Ringo sings wonderfully on the Lennon/McCartney 'with a little help from my friends', which IMHO is MUCH better than the pretentious version released later by Joe Cocker. <br /> <br />The psychadelic and juvenile 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' is another great song, very 'trippy' and spacey. Getting Better and Fixing a Hole are delightful songs; there is nothing to fault with them. She's leaving home is a beautiful orchestral piece sung by Paul. Mr Kite isan interesting track, not my favourite, but well produced <br /> <br />George's 'Within You Without You' is indian-inspired, but great to mellow out to, if a little drawn out. When I'm 64 is a very famous, jaunty, older style song. I wonder how much that song will be played when paul McCartney really does turn 64.. (that will be next year I think - he was born in '42) <br /> <br />Lovely Rita is a great piano-tune about Paul's love for a parking inspector. (?) John's 'Good Morning Good Morning' is about his dissatisfaction with life in the suburbs; it has a lot of bustling noises and some wonderful vocal melodies. <br /> <br />Then the reprise of Sgt Peppers rounds the album nicely in a slightly different tempo from the first version of the title track. But the real star is 'Day in the Life'; a beautiful song that I find impossible to describe. It features a total tempo change in the middle, written by Paul, apart from the main Lennon-bit. It is interspersed at times with swirling orchestral and piano work which is meant to simulate (I'm told) the effects of 'tripping out'. A great end to a classic album in history <br /> <br />I won't say Sgt Peppers is the Beatles' best; that is incapable of definition. BUT you absolutely have to buy it; it is perhaps the most influential album in rock history and well worthy of that statistic. <br /> <br />
B000002UCQ|5.0|I've read some less-than-favorable reviews about this Magnum Opus, and I wonder what planet they're from. Of course, I have the the three-disc vinyl LP. Didn't get the CD until much later.The LP came in a big box, lyric sheet, poster, all the perks most CD's don't have. I couldn't say this about \\"All Things...\\" as a CD, at first, I didn't have it, so for a long time, I didn't know. I'll just tell you about the music, instead.<br /><br />The first thing that jumps out at you upon hearing this, is that SOUND. I use capitals here, because the sound is HUGE. It completely envelopes you. Although different players are on different selections, it has a unified sound, from what were the most in-demand players of the day. And it sounds SO SOLID.<br /><br />Harrison's songs about spirituality are done with such conviction, that if TV evangelists had that same mixture of granduer and humility, the scandals probably would have never happened. On these, he really is singing to God, i.e. \\"Hear Me Lord.\\"<br /><br />The other songs are a good showcase of how eclectic his tastes and influences were. He hadn't divorced himself completely from The Beatles yet, listen to the lyrics to \\"Wah-Wah.\\" And the words to \\"Apple Scruffs\\" are about the girls who used to camp outside the studio when they were recording. Things like this.<br /><br />Sure, he didn't write Pop Ditties like Paul McCartney, and he didn't purge his demons in the extreme fashion that John Lennon did, you can see he was closest to Ringo Starr, professionally, and Ringo's early work has Harrison all over it.<br /><br />The \\"Jam Session\\" selections were just that, all the same key, and two of them sound suspiciously like each other, but they show great musicianship, by some guys who were having a great time in the studio, and I'm glad he included them.<br /><br />This is vintage contemporary music, and I hope the Compact Disc version holds up the way the vinyl LP set did.
B000002UAR|5.0|The year is 1966; the Beatles were at the top of their game. They were about to dispense with touring, which was bringing them all more frustration and agony than touring should. They apparently had so much trouble with fans that they found it almost impossible to do any sightseeing in all the places they went; they were locked in their hotel rooms. At concerts they had trouble competing musically with the screams of thousands of fans. On some concerts apparently they didn't even turn their amps on; nobody could hear the music anyway. <br /> <br />Why all this fuss? What could have been so good about 4 boys from Liverpool, England? I wasn't born until 20 years after Revolver was released, yet I can understand perfectly why. The Beatles were like nothing before or after; they took Rock music and transformed it from upbeat but often formulaic 12 bar blues stuff into something fresh and exciting. Revolver still sounds like this, almost 40 years after it was released. <br /> <br />I wish I had this album on vinyl. But as it is, the cd will have to do. I absolutely love this CD; no song is worth even thinking about skipping. There's something here for everybody; from wistful, relaxed songs like 'I'm only sleeping', which makes me want to lie down and doze off (not from boredom, just relaxation). Indian inspired tracks like 'Love You To'. The upbeat and delightfully witty 'Taxman' (by George). There are also sweeter songs, like 'Here there and everywhere', 'for no one', jaunty ones, like 'good day sunshine'. Somewhat silly but still enjoyable ones like Yellow Submarine.  <br /> <br />There are also some wonderful, bright and warm guitar sounds. Almost 'psychadelic' in tone, on songs like 'She Said She Said', 'And Your Bird Can Sing' and 'Dr Robert'. These are fantastic songs, for me the highlights of the album. That being said, it is hard to look past the subtle baroque brilliance of Eleanor Rigby, Paul's honest sole performance backed by a quartet. There was definitely something special about the Beatles <br /> <br />George's 'I want to Tell You' is another great song by the often overlooked Beatle. The album finishes with two very different, but both 'drug inspired' songs. Got to Get you Into My Life has great use of brass instruments in a more upbeat tune. The final song' Tomorrow Never Knows', is a psychadelic symphony. With swirling sounds, backwards guitars, it would clearly be very interesting to the drug taker. Not being one, I can still enjoy it as somewhat of a 'journey' <br /> <br />In short, you have to get this album. Why do I say this in all my reviews of beatles albums? Because they are all so great; call it overkill, but they were the greatest band ever and with good reason. Buy this record and see what all the fuss is about.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I've recently read the H.G. Wells novel, and have also seen the George Pal film adaptation of the \\"Time Machine\\", which, from what I remember at least, was very true to the book in most aspects. However, when I first saw the latest version of \\"The Time Machine\\" in 2002, I was completely unfamiliar with the story, as I had not yet read the book, and it was only after I had watched it that, being somewhat displeased by the film's ending (at the time) I was moved to read the book and find out exactly what the film adaptation had altered and changed, for better or for worse. And, I must say that, after finishing the book, I was dissapointed by the somewhat anticlimatic ending, and of course the sad fate of humanity in the distant future that the story portrayed.  <br />   Now don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the book and think it is both well-written and a mark of creative genius. My preferences, however, lie more in the area of heroics and happy endings where the guy ends up with the girl and they live happily ever after, which is hardly - in my opponion - what Wells was going for when he wrote \\"The Time Machine,\\" which is what gives the book its originality.   <br />   And so, after reading the book, I was compelled yet again to watch the movie that is currently in discussion, to determine for sure whether or not I truly liked the story, or if it was simply something that could never appeal to me no matter how much I would have liked it to. And, I found, after watching it for the fourth time, that it was my favorite version to date. And, although I must admit I haven't figured out yet what exactly occurs toward the end of the film when Guy Pierce says, \\"I'm changing the future,\\" (You'd have to see the movie to understand) I still enjoyed the film for its wonderful acting performances, appealing story, and most of all, the fantastic score that, in my opponion, \\"makes\\" the movie. <br />   And, as it states in my title, this film is in many ways very different from the book, and therefore, will be, more than likely, a dissapointment to anyone who is a fan of H.G. Wells' novel. However, I, being dissapointed with the book's unredeeming portrayal of humanity's downfall and the complete deterioration of the universe in the far off and distant future, found the movie to be a much \\"happier\\" story, and one that suits me better. So, simply, it all boils down to what you like. If anything, it's ninety minutes of pure entertainment. And, If you don't like the movie, I would advise at least in getting the soundtrack.  <br />    <br />   P.S. \\"I give the George Pal film five stars as well.\\"         <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|I've always wondered why this album is still variously called 'The Beatles' rather than just always 'the White Album'. Nobody ever refers to it as 'The Beatles', though that may 'technically' be its name. <br /> <br />OF all the Beatles records, this is perhaps the most intrinsically diverse. The boys were innovators from the get-go and never shied from trying new sounds and concepts on any of their albums. But on the White Album we see perhaps the greatest combination of different styles that any artist ever attempted. <br /> <br />I'm not an expert on music 'style', so I can't tell you what songs are in what style. There are some faster songs, some slower, some sweet and acoustic, some harder and more 'rock' oriented. This album contains possibly the first hard rock song ever recorded, Helter Skelter (featuring the infamous line 'I got blisters on my fingers!). There are jaunty 30's era songs (think Honey Pie), as well as ballads (I Will; Julia; Mother Nature's Son) etc etc. I can't possibly try to classify these songs properly so don't bother correcting me if I've oversimplified. You need to buy this album and see for yourself <br /> <br />This album often gets mixed reviews. Most people love it and give it 5 stars unquestioningly. Others point to some weird songs like Revolution 9 (which contains lots of strangely mixed sounds and voices for some 8 minutes), and Wild Honey Pie, and say that because of these the album is 'weaker' and deserves less than 5 stars. I can't argue that those songs are VERY WEIRD. I personally always skip revolution 9 because it isn't really 'music'. Perhaps if you were very high it would be quite an experience but otherwise its not really worth listening to. <br /> <br />Yet it is impossible not to love this album. It is so diverse and musically strong, more 'stripped down' after Sgt Peppers. Sure there are a few 'okay' songs (think 'Why dont we do it in the road'  - but good fun nonetheless), and a few 'WEIRD' ones. Others might be too 'silly' for some people (eg Ob La Di Ob La Da, Everybody's got something to hide except me and my monkey - though I love them) But the album as a whole is so strong and varied that it isn't hard to love. I personally LOVE this album; I have it on VINYL and I screamed like a schoolgirl when I discovered that my uncle was 'giving' his VINYL version away. <br /> <br />Ignore any stigmas about this album. Ignore Charles Manson and his retardedness/stupidity/ in interpreting some songs as 'messages' to commit violent acts. Helter Skelter for example, as far as I can tell, is about a slide. WOW that's a violent concept if I ever saw one There's no hidden satanic message. Charles Manson is just a &*%^&*(. Don't feel guilty listening to this album; it isn't the music's fault that he's insane. <br /> <br />In SUM, BUY THIS ALBUM. It took place amid feuds and conflict within the band (Paul actually plays drums on Back in the USSR because Ringo 'quit' for a few days). Yet despite this they compiled this fantastic album, not a single upon it, which has managed to become the Beatles' top selling record, even though it is a double album and more expensive than all their others. 50 million frenchmen can't be wrong; you need to buy this album.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I thought this was such a cute movie because of Reese Witherspoon. She is very attractive and adorable and no wonder Ryan Philipe married her. This is a comedy about a blonde sorority girl who is dumped by her man who is about to attend harvard law, and she is baxsically forced to show what she's made of so she goes to harvard law school to prove she can be smart, and serious enouh to impress his family, but ends up finding out who she is in the process. The message is never judge a book by it's cover, and the stereotype blondes are airheads is obviously not true. And the other message is basically the song at the end by samantha mumba and it goes I DONT NEED YOU TO TELL ME I'M BEAUTIFUL. The whole time her boyfriend would not accept her for who she was, and no guy is worth that. If he can't see all your qualities and love you for who you are he isn't worth it. It's mainly because of our brainwashed stereotypical narrowminded judgmental society that forces people to prove themselves to others. When the fact of the matter is, you know who you are and that's all that matters. Forget everyone else. I myself dont give a dam what others think. Kinda like the saying YOUR PERSONALITY IS WHO YOU ARE, AND YOUR REPUTATION IS MERELY WHAT OTHERS THINK YOU ARE.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is another brilliant record from the Fab Four, it appears as somewhat of a pivotal work between the earlier, more two dimensional (but nonetheless excellent) early beatles, as typified on songs like 'I want to hold your hand', '8 days a week', 'love me do' etc. These were all wonderful songs, but they were largely in the same early 60's pop vein. With Rubber Soul the Beatles showed their desire to move into more uncharted territory <br /> <br />My personal favourite is the wonderfully wistful, soothing 'Norwegian Wood'. Everybody knows this song; with George's great sitar work adding an extra element and foreshadowing the Beatles' emerging fascination with eastern music. I also really love 'You Won't see me', the vocal melody is just incredible. <br /> <br />That being said, there's nothing on this album that doesn't deserve high praise.  The thoughtful, warm sounding 'Nowhere Man'. George's excellent, but often overlooked (i have no idea why) 'If I needed someone'. There is also the acoustic 'Michelle', with its great minor chords. John's soulful 'Girl', apparently composed in a single day, is also delightful <br /> <br />I've always liked 'Drive My Car' for its lightheartedness, but its great melody is hard to get by also. In My life is a wonderfully thoughtful, almost existentialist Lennon piece. I wont describe the rest of the album because I'll be here all day. All I need say is that, just because I haven't mentioned a particular song, doesn't mean that song isn't equally breathtaking. You need to buy all Beatles records, ergo you should definitely buy this. If you're looking for somewhere to start, Rubber Soul is a good place to begin. It can provide a springboard to the Beatles' more experimental stuff that followed Rubber Soul, or back to the earlier material. <br /> <br />
B00004YA66|5.0|This is a true story about..just kidding. Yes it's science fiction, but definately intelligent, alot of fun, and finally an original idea. I saw it in theatre's with my friend and it's very entertaining and it actually has a plot, great acting, and great actors. I've seen it many times since then, and it still is a great flick even though i know what happens. I like Dennis Quaid, he made the movie great. It doesn't come off as being cheesy at all because of the creativty and acting you enjoy it even though this could never happen in real life, even thouigh alot of us wish it could. It's a suspense/thriller/sci-fi, and there are a few funny parts like when he talked to himself on the radio when he was a kid, hehe. Great film.. what else can i say
B00011RPB0|5.0|This film is about the paradoxical loneliness and emptiness in a world that is burgeoning with people.  <br /> <br />And amidst this, the strange and unexpected connections between people. It shows that the human soul never ceases to be lonely, even when one is married with children. It never ceases seeking connections, other souls to travel this journey with. <br /> <br />To me, Lost in Translation is also about the magic of travel. When you are alone in a foreign land, you never know when you will fall in love with a stranger, whom you might spend a few hours or a few days with, and quite probably never meet again -- but the memory lingers in your mind forever. <br /> <br />Very little actually happens in this film in terms of events, so if you need lots of events to enjoy a film, this is not for you. but if you are sensitive to body language, ambience, and subtle expressions, you'll love the volumes that Murray and Johansson speak without saying much - or sometimes, without saying anything at all. People around them may be continuously speaking Japanese, and they barely understand a word. but between them, they understand each other perfectly even when they say nothing... a glance, a smile... and there's magic. The magic of being Lost in Translation, together. <br /> <br />E-mail: elias_stars @ yahoo.com
B0006L0LOS|1.0|I honestly mean it when I say that \\"Catwoman\\" is the worst movie I have seen in my life.  It is the lowest of the low.  The absolute bottom of the bucket.  I have seen \\"Hypercube: Cube 2\\" and \\"Battlefield: Earth\\" and \\"Alone in the Dark\\" and \\"Plan 9\\" (who hasn't?) and even \\"Future War.\\"  Twice.  That's right, I saw \\"Future War\\" two times the WHOLE way through, and I would still rather do that than watch \\"Catwoman\\" again. <br /> <br />Often when I say a movie is horrible, it's just hyperbole for the purpose of humor.  But I really mean it when I say this.  If I was to count how many horrible tragedies I would rather suffer than to watch \\"Catwoman\\" a second time, my head would explode once I realized that the list contained more entries than the number of atoms in the universe. <br /> <br />This movie is sh**.  Utter sh**.  It is the only movie I have ever seen where NOTHING is done right. <br /> <br />I know a lot of people who would probably say that this movie is good if you don't take it too seriously.  But there's a problem with that assumption.  In order for a movie to be good, light-hearted fun, the director has to think of his movie as a popcorn flick.  Not a serious movie.  Popcorn flicks are all about action and quick-paced fun.  \\"National Treasure\\" is a popcorn flick.  It's illogical and silly, but it's fun because it's breezy and has snappy one-liners and there's a lot of great action scenes.  It's a fun movie because not even the director believes that he is making a realistic or serious movie.  Nobody honestly thinks there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, so you can lean back and enjoy the show. <br /> <br />\\"Catwoman\\" is much different.  Everything about it is made as if it is meant to be a serious movie.  This isn't meant to be a pocorn flick, it's meant to be an exploration of serious themes like freedom and the conflict between good and evil.  There aren't winks to the audience to let us know that the filmmakers are just playing around---it's just a dead, straightforward movie that is horribly put together. <br /> <br />Let's start with the basic concept:  A superhero with the powers of a cat.  When I think of cats, here are the special \\"talents\\" that they have/are said to have which a catperson might possess: 1) Exceptional balance.  2) Great jumping abilities.  3) Speed.  4) Quick reflexes.  5) Nine lives.  6) Retractable claws.  7) Mild toxins within the claws.  8) Sharp fangs.  9) Great night vision.  10) Always lands on their feet. <br /> <br />A good cat-based superhero would have most or all of these abilities and be pretty cool for it.  Wolverine has retractable claws and he's pretty awesome, right?  Super-speed, ability to jump---kind of like Spider-man, right?  Night vision, reflexes, these are all great things you could use to have a good Cat Hero. <br /> <br />In \\"Catwoman,\\" though, we have a superhero who has \\"far-sight\\" (which I'm not even sure cats actually have, but let's pretend they do) and she uses a whip.  She can also stick onto walls and climb on them like a lizard.  Occasionally she jumps, too, but mainly she climbs on the wall like a lizard.  And she uses a whip.  A whip?!  What the f*** do whips have to do with cats?!  Theoretically she has night-vision, but she uses it only when it's convenient and never at any times when it would make sense.  She has claws, but they're actually fake fingernails that she has glued on to her gloves.  She lands on her feet but only when it's at a time for comic relief.  She has good balance, but only when she's talking on the phone with her friend.  None of her abilities are all that good, and only a couple of them are even remotely cat-like.  Halle Berry isn't the Catwoman that hunts and pounces and strikes when you least suspect it.  She's the Catwoman that eats canned tuna and then sits in the corner licking her crotch. <br /> <br />So, she's not even a Catwoman.  She's a weird-lizard-Furry-woman.  And I haven't even gotten around to describing the movie yet! <br /> <br />Halle Berry.  How you won an Oscar, I'll never know.  You clearly looked to Dustin Hoffman for inspiration and watched \\"Rain Man\\" many times as research.  And then Pitof told you that all you had to do was shake your booty a bunch and the illusion would be complete.  Seriously, this is the worst performance in any movie I've ever seen.  Berry manages to get every single emotion wrong.  Even when she's playing a corpse, she doesn't look like she's doing a good job.  It's embarassing to watch her.  It's like watching a grown man running around in public wearing only a diaper. <br /> <br />The characters are all irritating, stupid, and wooden.  Cliches all around, from the obese best friend who tells bad jokes to the evil boss who's cheating on his wife and tells bad jokes about her age.  Patience Philips is the only character in the movie with any depth, but unfortunately she doesn't have length and width and must still suffer the shame of being uni-dimensional. <br /> <br />The story is about cosmetics that cause an irreparable skin condition.  You know how the Joker did that in \\"Batman,\\" and it was actually pretty cool because Jack Nicholson played the role with a lot of flair and the movie was stylistic and fun and didn't take itself completely seriously?  Well, the trouble in Catwoman is that it DOES take itself seriously.  It's one thing to have a plot about killer cosmetics and then throw in some other funny bits to show that the movie acknowledges its own absurdity.  It's another thing altogether to have characters try delivering lines with straight faces that all hinge on KILLER COSMETICS. <br /> <br />The dialogue in this movie?  My god.  Jeff Foxworthy has more sophistication than the scriptwriter of this travesty.  There is not a single good piece of dialogue in the whole movie.  Even simple lines, like, \\"How are you?\\" are difficult. <br /> <br />It's probably expected that there would be at least one line in the movie where Catwoman says that something is \\"purrfect,\\" but a good---or even an average---screenwriter would at least try to work it into the story subtly.  In this movie, they don't bother.  Catwoman actually breaks a scene and goes OUT OF HER WAY to say \\"Purr-fect\\" to remind us that she is, in fact, a CATwoman.  Just in case we forgot.  That's how all of the dialogue is in this movie---it's blunt and obvious and written as if you are a total idiot and can't figure anything out unless the script points it out for you. <br /> <br />There's a scene toward the end of this movie that really symbolizes my outrage at watching \\"Catwoman.\\"  The police are pursuing our lizard-crap-hero through a theater, and she leads them on a chase throughout a network of catwalks above the stage.  There's some sort of odd play going on below, with a bunch of dancers doing stylish things in pink outfits.  The audience looks bored.  Suddenly, Catwoman jumps on the stage and climbs up the curtain to get away from her adversaries, disrupting the play.  The audience cheers and breaks out in applause, really enjoying the show. <br /> <br />This is a stupid audience, easily amused by random crap with no context and a bad actress wearing an unflattering and ugly leather suit.  They are monkeys.  The director thinks of us like that audience. <br /> <br />Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to watch this movie.  I give it zero stars.
B0006L16N8|1.0|A little known fact - This CD was actually reproduced. It was remade because coldplay thought the original CD \\"didn't sound like coldplay\\". I'm sure the original tapes were Solid Gold material but it probably scared the record company to death.  shame for having a soul. <br /> <br />I was a huge fan of coldplays first two records. But trust me, there is no song on this cd you'll want to listen to more than 5 times.  <br /> <br />I promise you, one year from today, you'll have forgotten you've ever bought this cd. This is not good material. Trust me and save your money, or don't trust me and find out after about 3 listens through.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|I know I should focus only on \\"Cube Zero\\" in this review, but it's tough because I watched it (and most others will watch it) with some familiarity with \\"Cube\\" and \\"Cube 2.\\"  So, let's get this out of the way now: \\"Cube 2\\" was awful.  One of the worst movies ever made.  Horrible acting, a pathetic excuse for a plot, cheap effects, and a lot of unnecessary scenes.  The Cube itself looked like the next in line of Apple products (iTorture)instead of something grisly and frightening, and the people trapped inside were paper-thin caricatures that never really amounted to anything before they died. <br /> <br />When you watch \\"Cube,\\" you wonder why anybody would think a movie like that needs a sequel.  It was a wonderfully existentialist horror movie---creepy, suspenseful, and inexplicable.  It was a wonderful puzzle; you watched it for an hour and a half and then you spent weeks trying to think of your own explanations for why it happened.  The acting was (mostly) excellent and the set design was wonderful: terrifying and gritty.  The violence was kept to a minimum.  There was gore, but not a whole lot of it, which means that the focus of the movie was on the suspense, not on the gore.  (When a movie has over-the-top death scenes, it's not easy to really pay attention to the plot or characters anymore.) <br /> <br />So now we have \\"Cube Zero.\\"  When I began watching this, I was very worried about what kind of movie it would be.  I didn't think there should be another Cube movie, and from the cover of the DVD (and the pictures on the back), it looked like this would just be another hack 'n' slash gorefest. <br /> <br />And for the first twenty minutes that's pretty much all it is.  Needlessly gory death scenes and a whole pile of awful, awful acting.  I was certain I would hate this movie. <br /> <br />And then something marvelous happened---the movie began to focus on the character of Eric, the technician operating the Cube from the outside.  Suddenly, the movie became interesting because it had a plot and suspense and---best of all---GOOD acting.  The gore is toned down and doesn't become a problem, and then the story kicks into full gear and becomes a tale of repression and rebellion. <br /> <br />This is why \\"Cube Zero\\" gets four stars instead of one.  Despite the fact that the leading actress does a bad job and even though there are needlessly cruel death scenes early on in the movie, Eric's story redeems the movie and makes it worth watching---whether you've seen \\"Cube\\" or not.  I would even say that Eric is the best character out of all of the Cube movies, and I really love the way he is tied in to the first one.  The scriptwriter does an excellent job by simply pretending that \\"Cube 2\\" was never made, which is a good thing. <br /> <br />\\"Cube Zero\\" works because it is like talking to another person about \\"Cube\\" and seeing his interpretation of the story instead of just hearing it.  It should be watched as a separate entity from \\"Cube.\\"  It's not a sequel or a prequel; it's just one guy's explanation for how \\"Cube\\" MAY have come about.  And it's a fine story. <br /> <br />And the ending in this one is perfect.  It gives you just the right amount of information to extrapolate and come up with your own happy ending or your own depressing ending---just like the first \\"Cube.\\"  I thought there was no way to make a good sequel/prequel to \\"Cube,\\" but this movie changed my mind. <br /> <br />One last comment---the music video on the DVD is awful.  Not only is it a bad song, it also has no place in the movie and really ruins whatever atmosphere the film creates.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|This CD sounds like a blast of old rock from 70s. One review whined that the band ripped off every indie band of the 90s, and was thus unoriginal. Haha! If you put interpol, death cab, modest mouse, the shins, elliot smith, futureheads (whatever \\"indie bands\\" you want to insert here)in a blender, I cant think of ANYTHING more original.  <br />Neighborhood 1 is my favorite, it sounds classic enough that even my dad likes it. <br />Neighborhood 2 is just a fun song, and reminds me of Modest Mouse, my favorite band <br />Other standout songs include Neighborhood 3, Crown of Love, and my favorite, Rebellion (lies). This incredibly catchy song gains momentum as it goes on, and is great to pick up the slow atmosphere that develops near the end of the album.  <br /> <br />This rock album has cool packaging and is worth buying.
0972169504|5.0|Grad students! Are you working too hard? This comic strip collection can help.<br /><br />\\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" (\\"PhD\\") is the first collection of strips of the legendary webcomic of the same name, written (and published) by Jorge Cham of Stanford University. This volume contains comics from roughly 1997 - 2002, including classics such as<br /><br />--The Grad Student Documentary (\\"Having feasted, the grad student enters a lethargic state called \\"researching\\", in anticipation of the next free meal.\\")<br /><br />--What is... the Thesis (\\"Is it so hard to believe?

I... I'm still in school...\\")<br /><br />and many others. From the first crudely drawn sketches of cramped classrooms and quals to the later, well-drawn strips of research and conferences, \\"PhD\\" never fails to entertain. Some of the humor may be dark and depressing, but that just makes it more realistic, and all the more potent.<br /><br />If you don't believe that a grad student comic strip could possibly be so good, feel free to check out the strip's website, [...], where all of these strips are available for free. (But be warned - reading the entire archive could be hazardous to your research, and once you start, it's hard to stop...) Why buy the book when all its content is available free online? For one thing, to thank Jorge for all the hours of procrastination that he has so kindly provided. For another, to have access to the comics even when you're away from your compu... ok, never mind. The first reason is more than good enough by itself.<br /><br />Even though \\"PhD\\" focuses on engineering, grad students in all fields should find it equally entertaining. And of course, grad students are not the only people who can appreciate this volume - former grad students and future grad students will almost certainly enjoy it as well. All grad students past, present and future should purchase this first \\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" collection (or better yet, have it purchased for them) without delay., present and future should purchase this first \\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" collection (or better yet, have it purchased for them) without delay.

B0006B2A2E|3.0|If Philip K. Dick had written a romantic comedy, the result might have turned out like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. In this seriocomic SF love story, Jim Carrey proves again that he's not just another mugging face, and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman proves that he's the master of surreal dramedy. Director Michel Gondry, however, proves that Spike Jonze is really the most suitable director for Kaufman's particular brand of daffiness.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are stunningly believable as dysfunctional couple Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Clem initially seems like a sexy free spirit with a roguish streak, but as their romance continues, Joel sees the dark side of Clem's impulsive nature: on her bad days, hard-drinking Clem is needy and temperamental. What's worse, she sees Joel's relentlessly low-key, emotionally walled-off nature as a rebuke to her recklessness. Mutual misery ensues.<br /><br />No wonder Clem finally consults Lacuna, a Manhattan company run by avuncular Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) that erases your memories of a bad relationship. Lacuna even sends postcards to clients' intimates telling them not to mention the erased ex again, as Joel discovers when he sees one in their mutual friend's mail. Heartbroken, he also opts for the Lacuna treatment. While the erasing process takes him through memories of life with Clem, we discover that, when Joel wasn't being passive and Clem wasn't drunkenly cracking up Joel's car at 3 AM, the couple also enjoyed many good times together. Joel's reluctant to forget these happy moments, and that's where the film gets phantasmagorical as reality, fantasy, and memory collide. Within the maze of Joel's mind, he and Clem (who's been panicking and feeling like she's \\"disappearing\\" as she's slowly wiped from Joel's brain, despite having already forgotten him) team up and try to hide in all kinds of memories she has no part of. The funniest of these is the scene in Joel's childhood home, as a shrunken-to-child-size Joel faces Clem as his mom's miniskirt-clad, go-go-booted neighbor.<br /><br />The details of Lacuna's workings are ...SUNSHINE's most consistently witty, entertaining bits. Lacuna looks like a typical busy doctor's office, with receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst at her most winsome and dimply) constantly scheduling appointments: \\"Valentine's Day is our busiest time.\\" Funny yet poignant details abound, such as the teary-eyed client loaded down with her dog's belongings, a crucial part of wiping away memories of a loved one. The actual procedure is performed by young computer techies Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood, leaving Frodo Baggins far behind) who erase the subjects' memories in their homes while they sleep. The techs act like a bunch of fun-loving but irresponsible babysitters, swilling the unsuspecting Joel's whiskey, smoking pot and having sex (with Mary, not each other :-) as he sleeps. But Patrick goes beyond mischievousness into unethicality: usually a strikeout with women, he's begun dating Clementine, having fallen in love with her while erasing her Joel memories. Patrick tries to take the expressway to her heart by wooing her with her discarded Joel mementos. Of course, he doesn't consider that since Joel's relationship with Clem went sour despite all those nice gifties, history just might repeat itself. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bigger payoff to the Patrick subplot; he just kind of disappears from the film as if *he* were erased. Hmm, maybe that's the point.<br /><br />Director Gondry, who also directed Kaufman's HUMAN NATURE (2001), spends so much time cross-cutting, juggling the movie's timeline, and inexplicably staging certain scenes in darkness with only a flashlight rendering the characters' faces visible (for a film with \\"SUNSHINE\\" in the title, it often looks dull and dingy; maybe that's part of the joke?) that instead of enhancing the storytelling, it's merely distracting. You get the feeling Gondry doesn't trust the story itself to keep moviegoers' attention -- ironic, since he shares story credit with Kaufman and artist Pierre Bismuth. Having said that, when the visuals work, they work wonderfully, like when our hero and heroine dash through Grand Central Station while commuters wink out of existence left and right.<br /><br />Refreshingly, the New York locations aren't the usual hip or glamorous places. Joel and Clementine live in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and their apartments look just like homes of college students or artistic types trying to inject Soho style into suburbia. The filmmakers also make splendid use of the stark beauty of Montauk beaches in winter.<br /><br />For Carrey fans seeking slapstick and belly laughs, ...SUNSHINE... may seem to drag on eternally; its humor is more in the rueful TRUMAN SHOW vein, shot through with Kaufman's trademark surrealism. If you want a love story that will make you laugh knowingly and think about the way people approach relationships, ...SUNSHINE... is worth seeing. Hopefully it will convince you that counseling is a better approach to your relationship problems than science-fiction gadgetry!eling Gondry doesn't trust the story itself to keep moviegoers' attention -- ironic, since he shares story credit with Kaufman and artist Pierre Bismuth.

B00005Q66T|4.0|A good compilation of Madonna's greatest songs. If you don't own any of her previous records--then this is a good find for you. A lot of M's earlier tracks like 'Holiday' or 'Get Into the Groove' can be found on her first greatest hits album 'The Immaculate Collection'. The tracks featured on GH2 were released a little later in her career. However, there were a few songs on here that I wouldn't really classify as \\"hits\\", therefore they shouldn't have made her GH album. There were also quite a few songs missing that probably should've been on here. Any who, if you don't own any Madonna records like myself, GH2 and The Immaculate Collection are must haves. I would recommend both.
B00005S88E|5.0|Time and time again we are confronted with artists who put out a great debut album and never climb that high ever again. When it comes to talking about the paradigmatic example of such a phenomenon my choice would be King Crimson and their debut album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\" Released in 1969 with its distinctive cover art, this was the album that set the standard for progressive/psychedelic rock for the next decade. Except for the title track the songs are ensemble efforts by guitarist Robert Fripp, drummer Michael Giles, bass player and lead vocalist Greg Lake, keyboard player Ian McDonald, and lyricist Peter Sinfield.<br /><br />The best track on the album is the first, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" with its big main riff and jazz-rock middle section (\\"Mirrors\\"). The music is somewhat distorted at times, but that does not stop the group's musical virtuosity from coming through. As you would expect from the title, the song paints a picture of dystopian future that embodies the worst tendencies of the late 1960s, and remains the standard by which other progressive rock epics are judged. In terms of political sensibilities nothing comes close. The song also stands out because the following track, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" is more folk-rock and constitutes a sort of cleansing of the palate before proceeding to the rest of the album (it is actually a song members of the group had played on earlier efforts).<br /><br />The title track is not the best King Crimson song, but it is probably their best known one (and the one song that was written just by McDonald and Sinfeld). The conceit is of a medieval court afflicted by a black queen, fire witch, and other equally dark images heading for total destruction. It is a daring finality, teetering on the brink of the sort of bombastic pomposity that often afflicted progressive rock (Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" with its synthesizer excess is the example that springs to mind). Musically on this album as a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent. When I was growing up the singing voice I most wanted to have was Greg Lake's, and this is the album when he sounds the best. The result is that \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is one of the albums that has to be considered when you are making a list of top albums from the Sixites or in the history of progressive rock music. It does not matter that King Crimson had a revolving door lineup and that it would take them years to come up with anything close to this classic album.a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent.

B00006CXXU|4.0|I'd forgotten what a great record this was. It meshes together some of my favorite genres of music--r&b, pop, and rock. It's very personal and very captivating. Every artist comes to a point in their career where they want to tell their life story or give a little insight into their past. This album is it. It's basically X-tina's take on love, life, and relationships. I was a little upset though, because most of the tracks I like were not released as singles even though they should have been. Some of my favorite songs are--    Walk Away--This is one of the most powerful tracks on the album. X-tina talks about the rise and fall of a very intense relationship. You can really hear the passion in her voice.     Get Mine,Get Yours--The most sensual song she's made to date. I love this song.    Loving Me for Me--A very lighthearted, romantic track. Definitely a feel good song.    I love this album and would recommend it to any and everyone.
B00008EPMA|4.0|The British Progressive (nee Classical) Rock group Emerson, Lake & Palmer followed up their self-titled debut album with this second effort in 1971. That first album was a balance between the synthesizer overkill of Keith Emerson's keyboard work on tracks like \\"Knife-Edge\\" and the soaring melodic songs like Greg Lake's classic \\"Lucky Man.\\" However, \\"Tarkus\\" is most decidedly in the camp of the former. As such, the first seven tracks on this album, considered collectively as the \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" represents the best ELP effort in that vein, although \\"Aquatarkus\\" suggests the lads did not really have a way of ending the whole thing.<br /><br />\\"Tarkus\\" is made of seven parts, alternating four instrumental sections (\\"Eruption,\\" \\"Iconoclast,\\" \\"Manticore,\\" \\"Aquatarkus\\") with three songs (\\"Stones of Years,\\" \\"Mass,\\" and \\"Battlefield\\"). The suite does not really have a plot, although the cover artwork hints that Tarkus was some sort of hybrid armadillo tank that was born during a volcanic eruption. After a battle with a Manticore, Tarkus became Aquatarkus and apparently went swimming away to live happily ever after. However, if the story does not really hang together at least the music does, flowing from one section to the next and providing much more of a unified whole than we usually see in ELP's most ambitious efforts.<br /><br />For me \\"Tarkus\\" is just too much at the extreme of synthesizer excess in terms of ELP's music career, although the album did make it to #9 on the Billboard charts. I really like the later synthesis between the two styles the boys attained with \\"Karn Evil 9\\" on \\"Brain Salad Surgery,\\" although I suppose it comes down to a preference for the piano over the organ, which applies as much to the works of Beethoven and Back as it does to that of Keith Emerson. The rest of this album really comes across as leftovers from their first recording sessions that should have remained on the cutting room floor (\\"Jeremy Bender\\") with some really inane lyrics (\\"The Only Way (Hymn)\\"). After the thematic unity of the \\"first side,\\" the remaining hodge-podge is pretty lame. If you like the heavy synthesizer use the Tarkus Suite is a great example of Emerson on the organ. But if you prefer him on the keyboard and songs that better feature Greg Lake's vocals (best represented by the \\"Battlefield\\" movement of the suite), \\"Tarkus\\" will have a lower place in your ELP rotation.(\\"The Only Way (Hymn)\\").

B0006L16N8|4.0|As a music lover with (I'd like to think) discerning tastes, it sometimes pains me to admit that a band as commercially successful as Coldplay are actually any good. However, I can't get away from the fact that X&Y, the new Coldplay album, is excellent. <br /> <br />Certainly the band operate within defined parameters - the record is built on a solid foundation of classic song writing, with familiarity (of melody, of structure, of lyrical theme) a key ingredient. The instrumentation is fairly simple - the guitar tends to either contribute to the overall ambience of the songs, or else provide a simple hook to complement Chris Martin's vocals; organ and piano suffuse the whole with an air of melancholy; drums are more inventive than on previous material, but not to the point of distraction. What dominates this, as with other Coldplay albums, is Martin's lovely, plaintiff voice, as well as  his innate ability to craft heartfelt melodies that seem to tap into the vulnerable side in each of us. Heavy reverb and big choruses on most tracks give them an anthemic, stadium feel that will always appeal to the mainstream. <br /> <br />Coldplay seem to have made a conscious decision not to alienate their fans with anything too extreme and X&Y probably won't challenge most people's preconceptions. However, this does not make blandness the next logical step, as some reviewers will have you believe - this record is, for me, infinitely more listenable than the undeniably innovative, yet emotionally remote new White Stripes album. There are some beautiful songs on X&Y - Square One, Swallowed in the Sea and the gorgeous Fix You are currently my favourites, yet in truth there are no weak tracks. This makes it better in my mind than the mega selling Rush of Blood to the Head which, though it boasted In My Place and The Scientist in the credit column, compensated with Green Eyes, God Put a Smile on Your Face and Clocks in the debit column. <br /> <br />Coldplay seem destined to cement their place in the music pantheon with a hat trick of great albums, something very few bands have ever achieved. Don't be embarassed to give them your money - if anyone deserves it, they do. <br /> <br />
0552152927|3.0|Terry Pratchett is now a publishing superstar, thanks to his witty, wonky Discworld series. But the Discworld series didn't start off on such good ground. In first Discworld novel \\"The Colour of Magic,\\" Pratchett lets his plot get away from him and meander over the edge of the Disc.<br /><br /> Discworld is a flat planet, balanced atop four elephants that stand on a giant turtle's back. And somewhere on that vast Disc is Rincewind the wizard -- cowardly, greedy, unlucky, a dropout and not very good at what he does. Enter Twoflower, a rather clueless tourist, and the Luggage, a piece of walking, um, luggage which walks around on hundreds of tiny legs.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that he doesn't want to, Rincewind is required to help the Discworld's first tourist ever (it's Twoflower, in case you're wondering). They're attacked by thieves, have to gamble with gods, encounter Death (who speaks ALL IN CAPITALS), and bumble through magical spells that can cause some major problems. But that isn't the biggest problem, when they encounter the very edge of the Disc...<br /><br /> \\"Colour of Magic\\" doesn't have much of a plot -- it basically has a long string of confusing, unhappy incidents that plague the cowardly Rincewind, and it ends on an unsatisfying note. But at least the ride is fairly fun -- Pratchett spoofs the fantasy cliches with wink-nudge fervor.<br /><br />Pratchett peppers his satirical little novel with lots of fun ideas, such as the quirky gods of Discworld and the dragon that vanishes if you stop believing in it. Unfortunately, the dialogue and writing aren't quite up to par. At times it's the delicious tone of British comedy, and sometimes it's so serious that it seems like Pratchett is writing an entirely different novel.<br /><br /> Rincewind isn't a very engaging character in this volume -- we laugh at him, not with him. His constant efforts to keep himself alive are especially funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it). Twoflower is an amusing character, but the Luggage steals the show despite not being able to speak.<br /><br />Terry Pratchett's first Disc-book was moderately amusing. but it's by far the weakest of Pratchett's many Discworld books.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD. I dont think Ill ever find another CD like it. The only word I can think of to even describe it is epic. The piano parts are one of my favorite things about this CD. Its one of the many things that makes Absolution so incredible. Matt Bellamy's vocals are another thing. Yes, he has his times where he sounds like Thom Yorke (or should I say, Thom Yorke sounds like him), but I would never compare the two. You cant compare anything or anyone to Muse. Its impossible! Go out and buy this CD, even if youve only heard one song. Chances are, youll love it.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This film is like watching the Super Bowl and havng it end in a tie. That's exactly what happens at the end--the entire war between the machines and the people ends in a draw.  <br /> <br />Imagine if Jaws ended that way. Roy and the shark getting cozy on a couch and saying, \\"No hard feelings bud!\\" <br /> <br />Pathetic!
B00018D3RI|5.0|I loved the show back in the 70's and never missed an episode. I'm grateful to be able to watch them all over again. I especially love to see how the characters developed over time. Dial phones, no computers, no cell phones, crimes solved in an hour, and no commercials. Hallelujah! Starsky and Hutch were certainly \\"eye candy,\\" back then. I only wish they would have been on the air for many more years. The quality of the CDs is remarkable. I recommend them to anyone who enjoys action without gore and profanity.
B0006L16N8|1.0|All the flap over this overrated band demonstrates the sad sorry state of music today. This extremely derivative band throws in a dash of this and a dollop of that and everyone goes gah gah.  Geez.  I found this lp extremely pedestrian and homogenized.  If you like your music cream puff then you will dig this. Music for cream puffs. yep. that about sums it up.
0393317552|2.0|Mediocre attempt - does not seem to fulfill authors stated intent or that of the title. Wanders into apologetic ramblings about race and creed, largely without advancing any evidence for his reasoning - only statistically unsupported ideas. Prologue of book instantly made me suspicious of possible scholarly dishonesty and the following chapters did nothing to allieve me of this concern. I finished the book, I feel, about as knowledgeable as I began it - the information may as well not have been read because I cannot consider it as trustworthy, and must discard most of it outright.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I love Shakira. Ever since her appearance almost ten years ago, I have been interested on everything she does musically. Her first big album \\"Pies Descalzos\\" is nothing short of brilliant; with it's reggae infused rock and first taste at the magic of her voice. Then came \\"&iquest;D&oacute;nde Est&aacute;n los Ladrones?\\" which is one of the defining records of recent Latin American music, every song works, every song tugs at you, a masterpiece!<br /><br />When she crossed over to the English market we got \\"Laundry Service\\". Some have complained she lost her essence, I personally think she could've done much worst. Americans said she sounded like Alanis, when actually Shakira debuted almost half a decade before her.<br /><br />And the album itself is not so bad, it's funky pop to dance to, but well truth is most of her songs don't work their urban poetry the way they do in Spanish.<br /><br />Now comes the anticipated \\"Fijaci&oacute;n Oral Vol. 1\\", which is by far the best album I've heard this year. Combining lots of musical styles, instruments, taking her voice to a place worthy of praise, using her newfound international, commercial succes to the best she brings music that feels fresh and nostalgic, it will leave you in a trance.<br /><br />From the killer opening \\"En tus Pupilas\\" in which a dreamlike, French, background chorus accompanies us on a trip in which she tells us how miraculous it feels to see the process of creation emulated in someone we love.<br /><br />Then comes \\"La Pared\\", a throwback to 80's Latin rock that sounds so heartbreakingly good it will really hurt. A swift guitar joins her as we go down a spiral of pure emotion. Worthy of a listen is the piano, which works in ways only Coldplay has done it recently. This song has perhaps the best lyrics in the album, because what Shakira has always done best is talk about love, the one that hurts so much that it feels it will rip your heart out, her next song isn't the exception; in \\"La Tortura\\" joined by Alejandro Sanz she delivers one of the best singles of the year. With a spicy flavor she makes us move our hips without us even knowing why we're doing it, be careful though since the song is talking about cheating, lying and how love as a weapon is the worst assassin.<br /><br />In \\"Obtener un S&iacute;\\" French New Wave pop had never sounded this fresh...oh wait a minute it's Colombian! With a delicious bossa nova beat and supreme flute arrangements this song will have you going with a flow of seemingly pink, summer breeze.<br /><br />The album's first masterpiece comes in \\"D&iacute;a Especial\\" where joined by Argentinean master Gustavo Cerati she delivers a fascinating piece of electronic rock.<br /><br />The lyrics are uplifting (the chorus is perfect poetry) and there's a synth wave near the end that makes this sound like what Shakira was born to do!<br /><br />The song's effect is which makes it so powerful to me though, it makes you wanna belt your lungs out, it made me deeply nostalgic, hopeful and scared in a way...\\"dimos un salto mortal y hoy vuelvo a ver un faro en la oscuridad\\".<br /><br />Thank G-d her next piece is the riveting, fun \\"Escondite Ingl&eacute;s\\". Punk, tango and a little bit of psychodelic touches.<br /><br />In \\"No\\", Cerati's magic hand comes once more to bring Shakira new depth. The chorus made me almost bawl my eyes out, with it's seemingly violent urgency. \\"No se puede vivir con tanto veneno, la esperanza que me dio tu amor, no me la dio m&aacute;s nadie, te juro, no miento...\\"<br /><br />The empowering \\"Las de la Intuici&oacute;n\\" (my favorite song in the whole album and another masterpiece) begins as a synth pop song, with Shakira's voice slowly rising, until the disco powered chorus makes you move your head up and down, while singing what, in a just world, would be iconic. It's both an instant throwback to her \\"Estoy Aqu&iacute;\\" era and a gaze into what her future will bring musically.<br /><br />\\"D&iacute;a de Enero\\" is a piece of light breezy pop. Not that it's a bad thing, but it doesn't really fit with the majesty of what preceded it.<br /><br />Sexy whispers begin \\"Lo Imprescindible\\" as it gives way to a Depeche Mode sounding verse, that goes all hard on us with her perfect diction and a pulsating, head banging chorus. Then ends suddenly with a line that will leave you going \\"huh?\\".<br /><br />The album wrappers are an acoustic version of \\"La Pared\\", every bit as emotional as the original version, but the stripped down piano makes it simply raw...<br /><br />And a reggaeton version of \\"La Tortura\\", which has been my loyal companion for the last couple of weekends. I dare you not to thrust your whole body once it kicks off.<br /><br />This is more than worth a listen, it deserves to put this woman back to her original artistic integrity, I had neglected her for so long, that now it's a shame I wasn't anticipating this more.mprescindible\\" as it gives way to a Depeche Mode sounding verse, that goes all hard on us with her perfect diction and a pulsating, head banging chorus.

B00003CXB4|3.0|The lion king, in my opinion, is one of the best films ever made. The story is beautiful and the characters are realistic. It is a visually stunning masterpiece which I feel is on a totally different level, apart from the animated fairy tales disney generally churns out (which are good, but just can't compete).  <br /> <br />This DVD is impressive. The sound and animation have been remastered and are much more beautiful than the old VHS copies are. But I turned away from this for one reason: \\"The morning report\\" It is a shameless mockery of every level of seriousness in the movie. When I first saw it, I was disgusted with the way it pops up suddenly and destroyed the continuity in the film. I think it's the absolute worst disney song I've ever seen.  <br /> <br />However, if you can ignore the song, then buy it. I believe it's being \\"put back into the disney vault\\" at the end of the year, so decide for yourself.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium isn't perfect by far, but it definetly will entertain you at times. <br /> <br />Certain parts of the movie are wonderful. The fight scenes are awesome. The gun parts are cool, but there are also sword scenes. Although there aren't as much of those as guns, they are awesome. Christian Bale does a good job, as usual. Taye Diggs is perfect. <br /> <br />Now for the bad. Certain parts of the movie are real slow. It seems like the beginning of the movie isn't that inspired. As the movie progresses it gets better, but the beginning just doesn't have that much substance. Certain parts throughout the movie are slow as well, such as the scenes with Emily Watson. I think most would agree that although many of the characters don't show emotion(that's part of the plot), only certain people can pull it off and still seem captivating. Emily Watson just seems too lifeless, and she formed a bond with Christian Bale that feels uninspired every time I watch the film. I think they could of made a reason for their love, but instead she just seems like a way to tack on a romance to a film that doesnn't need one. <br /> <br />This film is really good at times, but it could have been done better. Still, I would reccomend any fan of the Matrix or the book 1984 to watch it.
B00005JMAH|2.0|<br />I, for one, was extremely disappointed with this film. I think that the third book was my favorite and, personally, this movie seemed to slaughter it.  <br /> <br />First off, why did the cast the actor who is the definitely of sleasy and villanous as Lupin? I think that was maybe the most horribly cast character in the history of film.  <br /> <br />Sirius is cast alright, a little fatter than I expected but still better than Lupin.  <br /> <br />The computer graphics are good, except for that final scene by the lake with sirius, which I won't discuss much further.  <br /> <br />The scene where Hermoine punches Draco is cool but it kinda came off as a desperate attempt to save a crippled film.  <br /> <br />Harry feints almost every other scene. I'm not sure where that came from. <br /> <br />The were-wolf is a shameful animation, he looks far too gangly and slim to by a horrifying monster.  <br /> <br />Overall, the plot line is skewered as well and I would never dream of suggesting this movie for harry potter fans.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Wolfgang Peterson`s \\"Troy\\" is an attempt to recapture the look and feel of those sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950's and 1960's - those multi-million dollar, wide screen extravaganzas that helped lure audiences away from their television sets at home and back into the movie houses they had so recently abandoned.  As is to be expected, \\"Troy\\" shares many of the strengths as well as many of the weaknesses of those earlier films.<br /><br />On the positive side, \\"Troy\\" provides us with the pleasure of watching history (or pseudo-history in this case) unfolding on a grand scale with events greater than ourselves being enacted on the screen.  It also boasts spectacular battle sequences with thousands of extras (or the computerized equivalent thereof) stretching back as far as the eye can see.  On the negative side, the movie suffers from over length, corny dialogue and banal characters who frequently get lost on the vast canvas of the film.  The good news is that, for the most part, \\"Troy\\" manages to triumph over most of its weaknesses.<br /><br />\\"Troy\\" is based very loosely on \\"The Iliad,\\" the epic poem by the Greek writer, Homer.  So loose is it, in fact, that the screenplay dispenses completely with the gods and goddesses who play so crucial a role in the original tale and, instead, concentrates exclusively on the humans who are left on their own to act out the drama.  Those characters read like a Who's Who of great mythological figures.  On the Greek side, we have Achilles, the pouty warrior who sits out most of the fighting because he feels personally slighted by the king who doesn`t appreciate him the way he should; Agamemnon, the arrogant chieftain who is more concerned with personal glory than with doing what is right; Menelaus, the impulsive cuckold who has no compunction about taking his nation to war over a personal humiliation; Odysseus, the pragmatic fighter who tries his hardest to get Achilles to see the error of his ways; and Patroclus, the impetuous youth eager to prove his mettle and his devotion to Achilles on the field of battle.  Lined up on the Trojan side are Hector, the sensitive tactician; Priam, the wise king and loving father of Hector and Paris; Paris, the callow youth; and Helen, the world`s most beautiful woman, for whose sake the epic battle is ultimately fought.  In fact, it is Paris` \\"abduction\\" of Helen from her Greek husband, Menelaus, that inspires that nation to launch a thousand ships, cross the sea to the fortified city of Troy, and do battle with the Trojans.<br /><br />Because of the quality of the source material, \\"Troy\\" boasts a slightly more complex and conflicted hero than we are used to finding in action/adventure films.  For even though he is reputed to be the world's most invincible warrior, Achilles is also petulant and spoiled, quick to anger and often more concerned with amending personal injuries than with safeguarding the welfare of his own countrymen.  The squaring off between the two bitter rivals, Achilles and Hector - two men who, under different circumstances, might have been the best of friends - is excitingly well done and suspenseful.  Ditto for the scene in which a mourning King Priam slips into the tent of his enemy to beg for the body of his son.  On the other hand, Achille's love affair with the Trojan \\"war prize\\" Breseis emerges as pure Hollywood hokum.  And poor Agamemnon has become far more of a conventional villain in this version than he is in \\"The Iliad.\\"<br /><br />Although the screenplay stays relatively faithful to the broad outlines of \\"The Iliad\\"'s storyline and characters, it can't duplicate the beauty and soul of Homer's poetic verse.  The closest the writers seem to be able to come is having the characters repeat over and over again to one another that men for thousands of years will still be speaking of Achilles, Hector, Troy, et. al. and the events in which they are engaged.  All this pretentious, self-reverential speechifying merely succeeds in throwing us out of the drama every time someone utters one of those \\"prophetic\\" lines.<br /><br />Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean round out the cast, but it is the veteran actor Peter O'Toole who, as Priam, delivers the one truly compelling performance.  It's also nice to see Julie Christie in a movie again, although her role as the sea nymph, Thetis, Achilles' mother, is too inconsequential for her to have much of an impact.<br /><br />\\"Troy\\" is little more than an Illustrated Highlights version of \\"The Iliad,\\" but for those unfamiliar with the work, it serves as a decent enough introduction for those willing to take on the real thing.every time someone utters one of those \\"prophetic\\" lines.

B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie has worn many different skins in his day, but the Ziggy Stardust persona represents the man at the peak of his creative genius.  A perfect musical mid-ground of the styles he had flirted with in the past, Ziggy represents a decidely glamorous and flamboyant version of sassy rock and roll that borders on the theatrical.  If it wasn't the first incarnation of glam rock, it certainly came to define how that genre was perceived and clinically executed.  Musically, the album flows seamlessly, travelling through the far out mind of the fictional alien figurehead who represents the album's namesake.  Chalk full of pianos, saxaphones, and searing guitar work courtesty of the vastly unappreciated Mick Ronson, it's undeniably charismatic,transcendent, and simply visionary.  All the while, Bowie managed to completely redefine the possibilites of what a front man could be; mysterious, hypnotic, and skillfully androgynous.  The whole concept has often been judged over time as a publicity stunt, but the songs themselves provide the album with an impeccable resume. You cannot argue with the swagger of \\"Suffragette City,\\" the sneer of \\"Hang On To Your Self,\\" the grandiosity of \\"Moonage Daydream,\\" and the sonic majesty of \\"Ziggy Stardust.\\"  No one did it quite like Bowie and although he has continued to transform himself, he never quite nailed it like he did on this one.  Ziggy may have fallen in the end, but this album will never fade from that bright, starlit sky of rock n'roll history.
B000002J2B|4.0|Balancing a rough and gentle set, Genesis's \\"Wind and Wuthering\\", is a prog rock melancholy celebration, and love, like for a bad child, of staunch European lone star England, with nods to it's aristocratic past, (Eleventh Earl Of Mar), it's Protestant 'work 'till you die' ethics, (One For The Vine), and it's current aggressive and perfunctory political state, (Blood On The Rooftops). With Phil Collins at the helm, the lyrics are just shy of Peter Gabriel's (gone solo), metaphoric wizardry, but Collins does paint a haunting imagery of merry old England, like comparing the writings of very British but layman, Arthur Conan Doyle with the more literary Charles Dickens, they both excel in their given genres.  The music is almost all Tony Banks controlling most of the album, delivering waves and washes of synthisized keyboards, giving it a low-key Baroque-like flavor, and the album breaks, in a very satisfying relief in the final track, \\"Afterglow\\", with Collins' ode to love seeming the last testement and property of his beloved England. It's all a more minor, but absolute Genesis music, and although you can't dance to it, thankfully, it can send you soaring. The album contains the dead-beat, mass appeal hit single, \\"Your Own Special Way\\", which should have been sold to Peter Frampton.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|The original Let It Be album was a mess: the silly and irrelevant dialogues, the fragments of songs (\\"Dig It\\", \\"Maggie Mae\\") and the overproduction of songs (\\"Across the Universe\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\").  That's why it worked, you see.  The various jokes and sniping (John's mocking of poor Linda, the auditions comment) gave the album a unique personality.  Phil Spector's production, while a bit much, gave the album a surprisingly cohesive feel.  And the songs themselves, from Dig It (credited to all the Beatles) to my two favorites, Two of Us and I've Got a Feeling, speak of the closeness these guys had, had lost, and couldn't regain.  Let It Be isn't the greatest Beatles album, but it's a unique album in the rock canon and certainly a very special album.<br /><br />This \\"reimagining\\" takes away all that personality and uniqueness and gives us, instead, a re-tracklisted and amateurish compilation.  To be fair, it contains possibly the definitive version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" -- much better than the Anthology version -- and a much better-sounding 1969 \\"One After 909.\\"  However, everything else is at best bland.  Many others have detailed how deceptive the \\"Naked\\" and \\"as nature intended\\" stuff is, so I'll skip it.<br /><br />- Get Back is my least favorite version to date.  It offers nothing to anyone who's ever heard the song in the superior album, single, or rooftop concert versions.<br /><br />- Dig a Pony offers nothing new.<br /><br />- For You Blue sounds nearly exactly the same.<br /><br />- Two of Us is hurt by the tinny, compressed remastering.  It's depressingly unmoving.<br /><br />- I've Got A Feeling is a new version that offers nothing over the old and is messier and less likeable to boot.<br /><br />- Don't Let Me Down doesn't belong here and is much better on Past Masters.<br /><br />- I Me Mine's best version is on Anthology 3 (because of the heartbreaking chatter at the beginning), but the original version is very similar to this one.<br /><br />- Across the Universe is nice, but any other version is as good or better.<br /><br />- Let It Be -- again, both the album and single versions are excellent compared to this.<br /><br />As others have noted, Apple passed up a great opportunity to make the complete rooftop concert, or at least a representative sample of it, available as the bonus disc.  I appreciate the bonus disc, but I doubt I'll listen to it again anytime soon.  To end on a tangent, the public would have been much better served with a rerelease of the film.

I liked how he outsmarted the other kids and I loved the way his sister and brother created secret identites. I'll defintiely tell my friends.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I was a bit aprehensive of seeing this movie. I didn't go see it at the movie theatre. nonetheless, I got the DVD to see it. Well to my surprise I really enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I recommend it to all the kids and the kids at heart. I will be watching this movie now every time the christmas season comes around. It should definitely be in your christmas collection. This one is sure to become classic.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Pros: <br />- I remember listening to this album before word got out that it was going to be remastered thinking to my self that it badly needed to be. \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" is Megadeth's answer to Metallica's \\"Black Album\\". Word for word, punch for punch, it contends. The remastered version blows the \\"Black Album\\" away. I can't wait for Metallica to remaster their catalog, but for now this is all I need. <br />- \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" was really the only album that Dave Mustaine remastered that sounded right. When listening to it, it seems to be timeless, but Dave seemed to have gotten a little to carried with the others. <br />- Bonus Tracks are included. <br />- Great cover art. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />- What the heck was Mr. Mustaine thinking when he decided not to include Trent Reznor's(AKA Nine Inch Nails) remixed rendition of Symphony Of Destruction[\\"The Gristle Mix\\"]. As I recall Megadeth even released a video for this song. Personally, Dave could have removed all the bonus tracks that were demo recordings and replaced them with this song and on top of that charged me five more dollars. Then, I would have still thought this album was a bargain. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />Great. <br />By the way, Trent Reznor's remix is available on the Breadline[Import] Ep. That is if your willing to dish out $25 for it. Plus shipping. :) <br />
B0009HLDFU|4.0|as soon as i heard 'best of you' i had to go out and buy this cd-unfortunately i've only listened to it about a couple times and i definitely think that the music is good, but i would have just bought it off itunes if i knew that it's copy-protected and i can't rip it onto my itunes. anyways, In Your Honor comes with 2 cds and i thought that was a cool idea- one is loud and the other one shows the quieter and softer side of foo fighters. i didn't enjoy the quiet CD as much as the loud one because i'm more of a loud, rock-n-roll type of person, but the quiet one is not that bad either. the loud CD alone deserves at least 4 stars and is worth the money
B000669GAI|3.0|Pros: <br />- It's a two cd set instead of just the one, which is usually the case for bands that have only been around as long as Pearl Jam. <br />- Includes all of Pearl Jam's RADIO hit songs. <br />- Great track mixing. There are the faster songs on one cd, and the slower songs on the other. <br />- Cool packaging and art. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />- The music is severely CLIPPED. It hurts my ears to listen. Just imagine for yourself the song \\"Daughter\\" on STEROIDS. Ouch. This is becoming a incredibly bad habit for the music industry and its probably only going to get worse. The clipping would have been acceptable if the music was remastered. Instead, it just sounds like it was. <br />- The songs \\"ONCE\\" and \\"BREATHE\\" could have easily been replaced with \\"OCEANS\\" and \\"LOVE BOAT CAPTAIN\\". Both songs were released as SINGLES and are far better and are also known for being fan favorites. <br />- NO NEW SONGS. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />Good, but the clipping is just unacceptable, maybe it's acceptable for bands like Megadeth and Metallica, but not Pearl Jam.
B0000028RR|1.0|Since my days as a young boy, I have diispised and loathed Liberals because they are thought-provoking and always question authority. I myself am a good conservative, I blindly follow the government officials and keep my family in line with daily Mormon Prayers and traditional values. A good American citizen follows these laws and does not question authority.  <br /> <br />These people in this band known as \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" are nothing more than Liberal Wackos, following the likes to that of Ted Kennedy and John Kerry. They all criticize George Bush, but I think that George Bush is a great American President, he is a good moral man with lots of wisdom and strength. <br /> <br />To listen to the words on this album make me think of Liberals taking over the world, my absolute worst nightmare. Questioning Authority and giving proven criminals freedom is a dangerous idea and must be condemned and never listened to ever again!!!! <br /> <br />Heathen Satanic-Worshipping ideas (aka The Liberal Agenda) are a power that must never be fueled. Jesse Jackson (aka Lucifer) is the craziest person that ever walked the planet and anyone else who calls themselves Liberals are crazy insane people who have their own thoughts and ideas. This is a one way path to hell!!!!! <br /> <br />Follow the President, but do not question his authority. That way, America can go to be free of Liberals and make the world a better place.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|It is obvious that A7X have changed their style of music in this album, which seems has disappointed quite a few people. Saying that I was disappointed at first, but soon came to love the album just as much as Waking the Fallen.  <br /> <br />Beast and the Harlot: Energetic opening of the album. Does drag on a bit long though. 8/10 <br /> <br />Burn it Down: Excellent song! One of the best off the album. Love the opening guitar riff. 9/10 <br /> <br />Blinded In Chains: Another song with a great opening guitar riff and a powerful chorus. 9/10 <br /> <br />Bat Country: Probably my favourite song on the album. Awesome solo! :D 10/10 <br /> <br />Trashed and Scattered: Another energetic and powerful song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Seize the Day: This song really breaks up the album well. Softer yet musically brilliant. 10/10 <br /> <br />Sidewinder: The only song I don't listen to often. Will probably grow on me as I listen to it more. 7/10 <br /> <br />The Wicked End: A song that's growing on me, doesn't grab me like the others though. 7/10 <br /> <br />Strength of the World: Starts off with a heroic feel, leading to a great combination of heavy and soft music. Awesome bridge/solo to the song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Betrayed: Excellent vocals once you get used to them, very catchy chorus. 9/10 <br /> <br />M.I.A: Great finish to the album. 9/10 <br /> <br />Overall City of Evil is a great piece of music that really shouldn't be judged based on A7X's previous material, though it still has the energy, harmonising vocals and power that A7X always had. A7X succeeded in finding a very original sound with City of Evil.
0307120007|3.0|This book is a powerful introduction to enjoying books if presented by a loving reader who emphasizes its strong points and demonstrates care in handling a book.  It is seriously flawed for any other than an Aryan child by the bright yellow hair and pink skin, though a good reader will avoid the child's noticing.  I say this as one who presented it to a brown-skinned child as part of a prescribed program.  The child absolutely loved all of it and wanted her mother to read it over and over- the ring, Daddy's scratchy face, the soft bunny, the mirror to see in.  The choice and flow of events is charming, which is why the book has endured.     Wish there were a less Caucasian version.
0769273602|3.0|This is a Fakebook of the vocals, not the music so much.  So no musical bridges, and it's aimed at solo instruments rather than piano or guitar.  It does have all (or at least a very large amount of) his songs, but it's the vocal part it has, with a few areas of instrumental notes called out. <br /> <br />The biggest problems with this book are that it has a glued binding, so it won't lie flat easily without loosening the pages, and that the songs most often begin on the right-page and require a page flip even when only two pages long.  The music is good, and it has a lot of great stuff he wrote but wasn't famous for such as \\"Because the Night\\" (made famous by 10,000 Maniacs) and \\"Blinded By The Light\\".  But be prepared for some annoyances due to the binding and layout.
B0002IQJUK|4.0|This album is a real blessing when you`re melting on a hot summer day. I bought it one day before my mothers birthday, and it was a great excuse to not sit outside in the burning sun, but on my room being swepted away by Gavins raw voice. Even my stereo seemded to enjoy this cd.  <br />  It`s so great to see that there are still really talented artists out there, not just Britney`s that sing whatever there maneger tells them to, but artists that can write sing (and do spilts wile at it).  <br />  When you buy the cd you get two for the price of one, one of the two is a live recorded version of the origanel songs. When you listen to this one, you can really hear that this boy can sing. I was really pleased whit his version of the song A change is gona come. The only thing I can say is: Whaow.  <br />  It`s a must buy for everyfan out there, and the only reason I didn`t give it five stras is because I thought that it was a bit soft and friendly. I heard a stage recording once and \\"gosh\\" that boy can scream.
0141439475|4.0|Who knew the monster could read, speak different languages, philosophize and had feelings?  I count myself in with the legions of dumb Americans who thought they knew the Frankenstein story.  Hollywood dumbs us down again, but even Young Frankenstein is a classic.<br /><br />This is a horror story mixed into an extensive travelogue from Geneva to Scottland.<br /><br />In my mind, there is a chicken versus the egg question about who created who weaved in and out of the story.  It also made me think that the monster was the Dr.'s punishment for self-absorbtion and the desire to play god (maybe I shouldn't clone myself).  Towards the end, I had a hard time deciding which character was more wretched - the monster for being given life or the doctor who was having his life taken away.<br /><br />Mary Shelly did an excellent job conveying the humanism of despair between all of the characters that I think is missing in a lot of horror books.  Her prose make it a nice time piece as well as nice overall canvas.  One aspect missing, although I suppose it was either because of the lack of medical knowledge or to keep in the avoidance of gore with the rest of the book, was how the parts of the monster were gathered and how they were put together.<br /><br />It is always better to read the book than see the movie, but in this case, since they are so different, you should do yourself a favor and know what the author really wrote.
B000002JSZ|5.0|Like Powerage, this is a great AC/DC album that hasn't gotten all the priase it deserves. It's the last album in which Brian Johnson has the full power of his voice and it shows the band making a definite shift from the bombast of \\"For Those About To Rock...\\", to a stripped down, straight-up, no nonsense affair. One could say all the songs sound alike (even by AC/DC standards) but that's THE POINT. Look at the simple black & white sketch cover and the running time of the songs/album. It's supposed to just hit you hard and get out of dodge...very punk rock aesthetic actually....although even the best punk never had a nasty groove like these cuts. Imagine if the song \\"Back In Black\\" just kept hitting you and hitting you, until you stuck up your hands and screamed, \\"I give up! You guys are the gods of rock.\\" That's Flick of the Switch. <br /> <br />The last GREAT AC/DC album and easily the second best (right after Back In Black) of the Brian Johnson era. Buy it, crank it up and rock out!
0316172324|3.0|Mr. Gladwell's subject is important, and he explores a number of thought provoking issues. However, like so many pop \\"science lite\\" tomes, Blink works awfully hard (and without much success) to provide a unifying theme for a scattershot collection of admittedly interesting examples. His bottomline observation: humans often make snap judgements; sometimes, that's good.  Sometimes, that's bad.  Got it.  I'll make a snap judgment and say that Malcolm's bank account is in pretty good shape.
B00000K0YC|5.0|Here we have what is probably Sonny Rollins' most popular album, although I do believe he has much better music on other records, such as G-MAN and THE BRIDGE.  However, SAXOPHONE COLOSSUS still measures up to all the hype it receives.  This limited edition remaster sounds great and up-to-date, even though it was recorded in 1956! <br /> <br />The group is a quartet made up of Rollins (tenor sax), Tommy Flanagan (piano), Doug Watkins (bass), and the genius that is Max Roach (drums).  Roach is undoubtedly one of, if not the greatest jazz drummer of all time.  Name a musician, and he's probably played with them at some point in time.  The presence of Roach is a defining element that brings the quality of the performance up a few notches. <br /> <br />'St. Thomas,' named after the island Rollins is from, is probably the most popular track.  It's a simple song that shapes the whole album with the smooth flowing tenor playing of Mr. Rollins and the syncopated, carribean influenced percussion and drums from Max Roach.  I actually listened to this track when I was visiting St. Thomas last summer, and the mood of the song fits with the beauty of the island <br /> <br />My favorite track here is 'Strode Rode,' because I'm a sucker for hard swinging be-bop.  It reminds me of the Rollins tune, 'Airegin,' which can be found on COOKIN' WITH THE MILES DAVIS QUINTET and BAGS GROOVE.  This track includes a masterful solo by Flanagan - his shining moment on the record. <br /> <br />We also have two standards in 'You Don't Know What Love Is' and 'Moritat,' which is the popular 'Mac The Knife' without the words.  I prefer this much better than 'Mac the Knife' because of the outstanding performance by this quartet.   <br /> <br />If you are new to the world of jazz, this is a great place to start, and I would recommend it alongside records like KIND OF BLUE and GIANT STEPS.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Hype!  The movie did not live up to the hype.  Well one thing that is good from this movie is the visual, maybe for a game or something.  Overall not that bad yet not that good disaster movie, maybe it is good the first time, but not to buy it though.
B000001FRY|5.0|I has all the other U2 CDs - except for this one. It was great to go back and hear the U2 \\"old sound\\" - very good CD.
B00004TRD8|5.0|What can I say about this DVD and movie in particular.  First off this is the best action film that I could think of.  This is truly an action classic.  Then they added the digital and audio quality to the DVD version, and it kicks up the experience another notch.  I put this DVD in and let the action come out of my home theater and it pounds my heart, just like it came out back in the early 90's on the movie screen.<br /><br />There are tons of features on the DVD from commentaries to trailers and interviews.  I really enjoy the extended and deleted scenes that were cut from the theatrical version.  It makes the movie more complete.  Overall, buy this movie and put it in your DVD collection.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Dark Chest of Wonders - The song starts out great, good music as usual from Nightwish. But then there's the choir, which is nice, but can get a little irritating. There's a good story to the song, which is one of my favorite things about Nightwish. Like I said, it has great music with full deep and dark power. Other Than the choir being a little weird, it's a good song. <br /> <br />Wish I Had an Angel - I like the beat of this song, really catchy! All around good song, strong music and lyrics. <br /> <br />Nemo - Very beautiful mix of piano and guitar at beginning (even if it is only for a little while, but it returns later!). This is definitely one of my favorites. Also, a small guitar solo! I know it's small, but it's nice to see good bands such as Nightwish putting in little things to keep from becoming to repetitive.  <br /> <br />Planet Hell - This time the choir goes better with the song! Fast paced drums and guitar is impressive. I really enjoy the theme and story to the song.  <br /> <br />Creek Mary's Blood - The Native American theme is nice. I really do like the lyrics and story of the struggle of the Native Americans. The song starts out good, nice and soft. Tarja's voice is great as always. Two and a half minutes gone by and it's still good. Another good guitar section here. But the chanting is sort of annoying, and when he starts speaking in the Native American language (I don't know the name for it) it starts to get sort of boring. Overall it's a good song. <br /> <br />Siren - Ooooh! I love the Indian theme! I don't know what it is about it, but it's very appealing to me. Except for the oohs and aahs, it's sort of annoying, even though it sounds nice. I love the music; it's got the perfect blend of violin and other orchestra instruments.  <br /> <br />Dead Gardens - Classic Nightwish good. <br /> <br />Romanticide - Dark romance and broken hearts is a theme Nightwish always does well. The music is again wonderful, with a powerful guitar solo. This is a good angry post - break - up song if you're into having angry songs. The song takes an interesting twist towards the end, which I really enjoyed. <br /> <br />Ghost Love Score - Another hauntingly beautiful love song from Nightwish, and well done I might say. No surprise though! The choir truly shines in this song, and supports Tarja's voice with out over powering her. Once again, a good guitar solo. Beautifully illustrated by the orchestra, lyrics, guitar, bass, drums, choir, and Tarja's voice, this song it another favorite of mine.  <br /> <br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan - Although this song is in a foreign language (which one I don't know), it's still very beautiful. It accentuates the softer side of Nightwish that is just as good as their heavier stuff.  <br /> <br />Higher Than Hope - Another dramatic song great music and lyrics. It's reminds me of \\"End of all Hope\\" from the Century Child CD, theme wise any way. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd say this is another awesome album by Nightwish. I'm so glad they could include a full orchestra, because I know now the band can have the music sound good to it's fullest extent.
0471702188|5.0|Have used the book for years and this may be the best update yet.  The case studies alone are simply fascinating.  The global nature make it invaluable for everyone in business anywhere.  New discussions on return on capital and growth are must-read.
B00004S8Q9|1.0|This is an absolutely terrible CD. The band struggles to stay together, with the drummer missing his beat often, and Jake, well, I think he must have been medicated. The guitar sound is definitely Jake of old, but the chops are sub-par and baroque at best. He's all over the place, with no rhyme or reason. What a mess. If you do get this CD, you'll listen to it once, shake your head in disbelief, and put it on the shelf.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I bought the original 1975 LP when it was released...and also grabbed the first series of the CD when it came out....but if you REALLY want the experience.....you need the remastered version....this truly Jeff at his best.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Of course if you look at history and then watch Troy of course you'll see errors.  But that's Hollywood for you, they tweek history in every movie.   <br /> <br />It's a good movie, lots of action and great fight scenes.  Brad Pitt & Eric Bana look exceptionally good.  Just take it for what is is, good entertainment.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|He lacks a little bit of depth and resonance, perhaps, especially on the lower notes, but Scottish actor Gerard Butler really doesn't sing \\"like a meatloaf stuffed with garlic\\", as one mean-spirited critic wrote. And when you consider the fact that he is not a trained singer, Butler fares very well as the Phantom. His vocals on the title song are a bit odd, and betray his normally heavy Scottish accent, but almost everything else is excellent.    Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted a Phantom with \\"some rock n' roll\\" in him, not an opera singer or anything along those lines, and while Gerry Butler (as he prefers to be known) does fall short of Michael Crawford's definitive vocal performance as the title character, his acting is very, very good, and he imbues the masked Phantom with plenty of genuine passion.    The script stays relatively close to the original stage show, with a few minor changes in dialogue and for the sake of pace. And the movie is visually stunning, from the Phantom's underground lair to the mascarade. Terrific orchestrations, too, and Minnie Driver, whose voice is overdubbed for the operatic parts, is irresistable as leading lady Carlotta Giudicelli.  This particular character has all the makings of a one-dimensional cliché, but Driver's performance is charming and just suitably over-the-top.   And Emmanuelle Rossum...! Director Joel Schumacher wanted a young cast, and the casting of then-16-year-old soprano Emmy Rossum is a stroke of genius. Mature beyond her years, she possesses a natural beauty and a fabulous singing voice, genuine \\"bel canto\\" with a sweet, lyrical timbre. Some sopranos come off sounding more like a musical instrument than an actual human being, but Rossum's is a young girl's voice, smooth and lovely. I can't even think of anyone to compare her with...soubrette Reri Grist, perhaps, who sang opposite Fischer-Dieskau in \\"Don Giovanni\\", and performed the soprano part in the final movement of Mahler's Fourth Symphony in Bernstein's classic Columbia recording.    \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece...the score is filled with lovely melodies, well-wrought opera pastiches and grand arias. Emmy Rossum's performance of \\"Think Of Me\\" is breathtaking, and hers and Gerry Butler's rendition of \\"The Point Of No Return\\" is a highlight in, well, the history of musicals. I know that a lot of people had hoped to see Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and while the combination of Crawford's and Rossum's voices would have been incredible, Crawford was 61 when shooting began, and a 61-year-old Phantom opposite a 16-year-old Christine would probably have been a bit much, even as youthful and charming a 61-year-old as the great Mr Crawford is.   And while Gerry Butler may not be the greatest singer ever to take on the rôle of the Phantom of the Opera, he is actually pretty high on my list, and his abilities as an actor make up for everything that may be missing vocal-wise. Really, they do. There are some genuinely touching moments along the way, and all of them involve Butler.     I know there'll be plenty of people who will dislike this movie because it's not excactly like the show, and Gerry Butler isn't Michael Crawford. And there will be plenty of pet peeves aired as well, but honestly...if you want the stage production, go see the stage production. This is a movie, and it's a pretty great one.    Don't cheat yourself out of this experience. There is a reason why the \\"original\\" has been seen by over 80,000,000 people, and it has translated very well onto the big screen.
B0007P3582|2.0|I bought this album back in March, and for the first couple of days, I loved it. Then, after hearing about him removing The Game from his label, plus learning more about his songs, I started to dislike the album. But since then, I still don't know what to say about it. There is only a handful of songs I like on the album, which are \\"GatMan & Robbin,\\" \\"GunZ Come Out,\\" \\"Hate it or Love it,\\" and \\"Piggy Bank.\\" The rest I feel were just filler. Also, 50 Cent thinks way too much of himself, thinking he is this big #1 rapper, and trying to start something with all these other rappers... it's just stupid. So, I guess I now know what to say about this album, \\"Bootleg it.\\"
B000819PKC|5.0|Jamiroquai's musical journey over the past twelve years and now half that many albums is complex and intricate.It started in the British acid jazz vein then went on the embrace 70's disco-funk and electronics-all with Jay K's great singing voice and strong gift for melodic songwriting.On this brand new studio album the single \\"Feels Just Like It Should\\" is more a more modern hip-hop inflected (and rather typical) song.Not exactly typical Jamiroquai.Neither is the modern pop of \\"Hot Tequila Brown\\" or the hard rock of \\"Black Devil Car\\".<br /><br />  But Jay K's always got his classic sound up his sleeve and especially on \\"Don't Give Hate A Chance\\" he whears it proud.Same goes for the title song and the pulsing \\"Electric Mistress\\".\\"Seven Days In Sunny June\\" takes on a pretty trubadour soul turn with a nice acoustic guitar.But everything on 'Dynamite' is pretty far removed from Jamiroquai's frantic 70's jazz-funk-soul-pop sound of yore.Well at least on the jazz end.This music is basically 70's/early 80's electro-styled dance-funk music with a few modern touches.Not typical in some ways but at least there are signs of artistic growth.
B0006L16N8|3.0|After liking the debut \\"Parachutes\\" and really loving the last album \\"Rush,\\" I was expecting an album that this band could take over the world with.  Even though it is going to be near impossible for them to do that.  Face it, they play soft rock music with love songs and pianos in basically all of them.   <br /> <br />But honestly, it's not there.  Dont get me wrong, very strong showing and definetly worth picking up.  But there are a lot of good songs here that just don't have that extra something to make them \\"special.\\" <br /> <br />Examples are \\"Square One,\\" \\"What If\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" are all very good, but they aren't that memorable and aren't single material.  \\"Speed of Sound\\" will never be played again on the radio after 2005. <br /> <br />The one truly great song here is \\"Fix You.\\"  It's basically perfect, from beginning to end.  The guitar riff that comes in at the end of the second verse, although hijacked, is amazing. <br /> <br />Coldplay are a great band and this is a good album, but people are saying this album is the best album of the year.  It's not that, in my opinion.  But like I said before, definetly worth checking out. <br /> <br />They are a band that wants to become the biggest band in the world, as Chris Martin freely admits.  But new bands like the Killers and Interpol are coming out swinging, and they still have a way to go before they can touch the real two biggest bands in the world: Green Day and U2.   <br /> <br />
B000A59PMO|5.0|there's not much to say, except that veronica mars is the best show ever in the entire world! i miss it so much!! and the shows are so well written..i just cant get enough BUY THIS DVD its WAY worth it!!! :)
B00005R1N3|2.0|I really don't understand why so many people like this movie so much.  I consider myself a pretty big horror buff, but this fell way below my standards.  I thought it was boring, had weak murder scenes and had an absolutley horrible ending.  There was more shots of the house mother taking nips of Mad Dog 20/20 than killing scenes.  I liked the killer's dialogue though, haha, but that's about it.<br /><br />I can see people enjoying it somewhat, but to call it the best slasher of all time and think it's the scariest movie they ever saw is just plain upsurd.

0800141660|5.0|Ten years later, this is still my all-time favorite movie.  The landscapes are breathtaking and the characters are so real I have a difficult time seeing the actors in other roles.  I wept uncontrollably the first 20 times I watched the final scenes, which tells me what fantastic characterization was accomplished.  I loved every minute of the entire movie and I never tire of watching it. I watched it almost daily for over a year.  It only left me wanting more!  So many movies today are marred by overacting that's so obvious I turn to my spouse and grimace.  There's no need to be embarrassed for the actors in this movie.  Perfect!!  I need the DVD version!
B00005U2LM|5.0|Ok, I've had enough with all you wack cats dissing this album. Yall need to quit. You don't know nothin but Wu. Anyways, a year later after \\"The W\\" release, this album comes out. It was very hyped up, people thought it was going to be better than \\"The W\\" but people said it sucked more. I disagree. The tracks seem more full on this album. But then again the production is ehh, alright, but could have been better. Not many members spit alot on this album. Maybe they needed more tracks? There wasn't no Kung-Fu samples or no fighting samples in this album which was kind of dissapointing, but the tracks were still decent. Im still giving this album 5 stars because it was still decent effort which I still listen to this album now, so its good enough for me.  <br /> <br />#1.In The Hood - 10/10 <br />#2.Rules - 10/10 <br />#3.Chrome Wheels - 9/10 <br />#4.Soul Power - 9.5/10 <br />#5.Uzi (Pinky Ring) - 10/10 (Youll like this one) <br />#6.One Of These Days - 9.5/10 <br />#7.Yall Been Warned - 10/10 <br />#8.Babies - 9.5/10 <br />#9.Radioactive - 10/10 <br />#10.Back In The Game - 9.5/10 <br />#11.Iron Flag - 9.5/10 <br />#12.Dashing (Reasons) - 9.5./10 <br /> <br />This album is good, but definately could have been WAY better. Its definately not true Wu-Tang potential. No worries, there next album will be PERFECT! <br /> <br />BUY!
B000021YQV|5.0|In a decade where Metal evolved into it's lesser form, \\"Nu-Metal\\", it has been hard to find artists that break the mold of the conventional. Most rock today is either excessively hard or excessively bland, and most of the time the lyrics concern how much life sucks, how much so and so hates the world, or how the band is rebellious and hates everything. Out of this seething mass of \\"Nu-Metal\\", comes System of a Down, completely their own and not afraid to have lyrics with meaning. After their self titled release, many were anxious to see how it could be topped. Lead singer Serj Tankian's crazy vocals and the fact that their songs didn't follow the traditional mold were what made SOAD special.  <br /> <br />But on Toxicity, better production quality and even better songs topped the original by far. Every song on this album is good. That is not said lightly, or cliched. Literally every song on here is it's own monster, from the wildly popular (\\"Chop Suey\\") to the downright political (\\"Prison Song\\"). Each is hard rock without being a screamfest, with crunching guitars and crazy vocals by Serj Tankian and singer/guitarist Daron Malakian, both of which are completely unique in music today. Both are truly voices that are similar to none other, and SOAD's style is immediately recognizable. A blend of thrash and heavy metal, Armenian influences are felt throughout, by use of foreign instruments and even a chant at the very end to the beat of drums marks it as invariably unique and special. <br /> <br />The best songs, out of the many good ones are \\"Prison Song\\", \\"Deer Dance\\", \\"Forest\\", \\"Science\\", \\"Toxicity\\", and \\"Aerials\\", with \\"Science\\" being my personal favorite. It does echo left wing sentiments, especially on \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\", but it does not let itself become a political album by any means. The fact that they do not sing about themselves, a plague of modern music today, and focus on issues and events make the lyrics of this album very good and provocative.When coupled with the heavy guitars and amazing vocals, the meaning is really not the only thing carrying the album, and does not become too overbearing. Overall, this is one of the best albums this decade so far, and will probably be five years from now too.

B00097DX3U|4.0|The first Audioslave album was probably one if not the best album of 2002.  The way I see it, Audioslave is Rage without the weight of Zack de la Rocha bringing them down.  It's the best part of Rage (the band), and the most directly notable thing about Soundgarden (not the best, the most notable--Matt Cameron could totally kick Brad Wilk's ass at drums...). <br /> <br />This album, however, falls a little short of the standard and expectation that the first put out there.  Don't get me wrong: it's a great album, but it is not like the first.

B0009A1B7C|1.0|I listen to the radio (or I used to, at least), and most of what I hear now is just absolute crap.  No one seems to have a concept of rythm, harmony, or key anymore.  I've seen many new bands that just suck get wide recognition for talentless crap. <br /> <br />Though, very rare is it that a band that had a few good albums turn into something that is just awful and get praised for it!  SOAD used to be able to write songs that were composed fairly well, but their new album isn't even composed!  It sounds like they had a bunch of parts of songs and then smashed them together at random.  That's not composision, that's lazyness. <br /> <br />This is coming from someone who used to love SOAD.  I have every album, I have an unauthorized DVD of their bio, I saw them at Ozzfest.  I LOVED this band. <br /> <br />But, now they have lost whatever they had going for them.  Too bad.

B00001IVOR|5.0|Wu-Tang Clan, years later comes back strong and in control with this album. The beats are still Wu, the lyrics are still Wu. You hear more lyrics spitten from everyone in the Wu-Tang, unlike the first album, where some of them didnt rap much. This one they do for sure.

0778321606|1.0|I bought this book based on the Amazon.com reviews -- but it's a good lesson in \\"what's good for the goose....\\"  I found this book insipid and uninspiring.  I can't even give the book 3 stars as a \\"light read,\\" it was NOT even entertaining.  The sex scenes in the book seemed wooden and superfluous -- as if they were added in after the fact, to \\"spice it up.\\"  The characters are underdeveloped and the plot is silly and a bit fantastical (I mean, c'mon, how many gorgeous UPS drivers actually fall in love with a cancer survivor they meet on their routes?)  I understand this book is somewhat autobiographical, but a good story needs to be written by a good writer.  If you crave meaty literature, like \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" or want a light-read \\"chick lit\\" such as \\"The Other Side of the Story,\\" DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!

B00006JDVV|4.0|A London construction project uncovers a horrible secret and a young boy loses his mother at the same time.  A tunnel project has awakened a dragon.  Soon they breed like rats and proceed to burn civilization and all life into oblivion.  They have been here before but we did not recognize the signs.  Their attack is so quick that years later humanity is all but completely wiped out. <br /> <br />The young boy is now a young man and in charge of a group of refugees trying to reestablish themselves.  Dragons are getting desperate as their food supply is almost completely gone.  But internal and external forces combine to bring great change.  Some residents are losing faith and want to go against the community's plan.  A group of American military arrive and they specialize in killing dragons.  They also have a crazy plan for getting rid of the dragons for good but they need more men. <br /> <br />This tale of survivors facing impossible odds with an iron will to survive is well crafted and easily rewatchable.  The acting is good while the effects are excellent.  but this is not a movie about dragons, it is a movie about people and how they deal with adversity.  Although the movie is really about people, the dragons are wonderful and full of menace.  Definitely worth watching.
6305508550|5.0|Anyone who has ever worked in an office environment with at least a medium-sixed company can relate to this fantastic film.  One wonders why Mike Judge does not direct more.  He's an enormous talent and this movie is dead on target.  Virtually anyone who has work in an office can identify with out of control birthday celebrations, the joy of working in a cubicle, the big bosses creeping around, and the unGodly threat of consultants.<br /><br />I remember my own meeting with a consultant.  Talk about bubble-brained.  I'd love to get paid for a job like that.  And oh..the timesheet thing and multiple job codes.  I swear Judge must have visited the place where I USED to work!  Anyway we've got Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) working to update Y2K software for the company he works for.  He hates it...he's bored with it...and his bosses keep hounding him for TPS reports.  One day he just decides to not show up for work.  He's not quitting..he just isn't going to go anymore.  He comes in finally to pickup his address book and has his meetings with the consultants played marvelously by John C. McGinley and Paul Stewart as the \\"Bobs\\".<br /><br />Peter explains how he comes in late and only does about 15 minutes of real work in a week.  The Consultants immediately see him as management material and want to promote him!  Classic!  Richard Riehle as Tom Smykowski has a classic meltdown when he meets with the consultants screaming, \\"I HAVE PEOPLE SKILLS...I'M GOOD WITH PEOPLE!!!  WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE!\\"  Gary Cole steals the show as smarmy, do-nothing boss Bill Lumbergh whose shallow politeness makes you just want to poke his eyes out.  When Peter finds out two of his buddies are going to be laid off they hatch a plot to infect the accounting software with a virus and move money into an account they've opened.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston is Joanna who has her own work problems working for one of those generic bar & grill type restaurants and Steven Root is tremendous as the sheepish, squirrely Milton who was supposed to have been laid off five years earlier but was never told.<br /><br />Judge obviously has a great grasp of the office environment and his biting satire of dealing with the firing of employees ought to serve as a swift kick in the butt for all greedy corporate upper management.  Tremendous film that only gets funnier everytime you see it.oot is tremendous as the sheepish, squirrely Milton who was supposed to have been laid off five years earlier but was never told. <br /> <br />Judge obviously has a great grasp of the office environment and his biting satire of dealing with the firing of employees ought to serve as a swift kick in the butt for all greedy corporate upper management.

B0001CNRS4|4.0|Meet Honey Daniels. A attractive and hard working young lady who burns the candle at all angles, she is a club bartender/retail worker/dance techer; she's also a choreographer who aspires to be a lot more. Guided by the hands of fate(and a video camera) her impromptu dancing catches the eye of a big time and decidely horny video director who would like Honey to \\"audition\\" for him in private. I would like to give Jessica Alba HUGE props for not pulling a \\"Flashdance\\" on us and doing all her dancing. My only real reservation is that Jessica seems not comfortable speaking the hip hop venacular; but with Joy Bryant at her side , it's not that noticeable. This movie continues the string of hip hop influenced movies that have ome out as of late. Very enjoyable.
B000002JPA|5.0|Quite simply, this is THE progressive metal album by which ALL others are measured.  I don't know what else there is to say.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|this is what movies are all about, to Be enjoy...a great movie, of suspence based on a greata comic book, for the ones who said the movie sucked,STAY HOME AND READ A BOOK!! dont go out Its bad for you.<br /><br />Peace.
1401301010|5.0|First let me start off by saying that I don't generally read very much.  My desire to pick up something and read it for enjoyment pretty much ends at the Rolling Stone, Spin, and the sports page.  But I'm a huge Chili Pepper fan so I decided to give it a shot.  I'm happy I did.  For not enjoying reading much, I've already read this book twice, so I decided it was about time to review it. <br /> <br />Now I know Larry Sloman pretty much wrote the entire thing with Anthony's help, but it is a very easy read.  Its very enjoyable, quite disturbing, and I hate to say it, but it makes Anthony look quite despicable at some points.   <br /> <br />My favorite aspect of the book is that it goes WAY beyond Behind The Music.  I love the beginning that describes Anthony's childhood growing up in Michigan, visiting his father in California, and how his relationship with his father is as strong as possible.   <br /> <br />This biography also chronicles in more details the slew of different musicians that have been in the band, including Duane \\"Blackbyrd\\" McKnight, Jack Sherman, Cliff Martinez, and even a small portion on Jesse Tobias, their guitarist for 18 seconds.  Other personal favorite moments in this book were the band's initial thoughts on Chad Smith, everything Bob Forrest related (except for the fact that half the time it is spelled Forrest and the other half Forest), the John Frusciante(God) stories, and his relationship with Dave Navarro.  From interviews and everything else, it always seems like Navarro is an a-hole, so I was glad to see just how important he was in Anthony's recoveries and in his life in general.  Anthony should have died like 6 times in this book.  From jumping off apartment buildings to getting hit by motorcycles, it is insane.  It just shows how lucky he is.  Oh yeah there is a reference or two in there about drugs too.   <br /> <br />Many other reviews criticize the amount of drug references, and his escapades with multiple women.  Yes, there is agood amount of that in the book, but guess what he's a rock star!  What do you expect a tale of tea, crumpets, rainbows, and fairies?  Personally I was not offended, and I actually enjoyed reading about Cher, Ione Skye, and Sinead O'Connor.   <br /> <br />So if you don't like numerous drug and sex references, stick to VH1's Behind the Music, but if you want the raw details of the life that is Anthony Kiedis, buy this book.  You won't be disappointed.  Yeah as a side note the captions he writes for the pictures are all pretty funny.
B000005J56|5.0|This is a brilliant work, crafted around fantastically gifted musicians and great production. It's soul-moving music. Please buy it.
B00002EPMF|3.0|When you start listening to this album, it has a lot of promise in the beginning then it goes...where does it go? Since the album has a lot of ex-Death members in it, you'd expect it to sound a little bit like a Death album, which it does, but the main problem with this album is \\"connection\\".  <br /> <br />This album is basically a collection of really cool riffs that somehow were not worked into song format very well. For example, in the song \\"Expect the Unexpected\\" it starts out with a cool intro and then a great verse which right as you're getting into BOOM, they change to another riffs. As you're finally getting into the chorus yet AGAIN, another change-up. These guys must have forgot that part of the art of music is finding a cool riff (which they have done well) and knowing how long you can use it for (another important detail) before it becomes old. <br /> <br />All the instruments are cool, especially the guitars and bass (DiGiorgio is THE MAN when it comes to bass). The vocals are incredibly annoyning in that kind of old-school Power Metal variety. They actually found someone worse than Chuck to replace Chuck -Wow, that just makes a ton of sense guys. Because of the cryptic/weird nature of the lyrics I'm going to assume Schuldiner wrote the lyrics. <br /> <br />Still worth checking out especially if you can find this one the cheap. Rather ironic title for the album too, huh? <br /> <br />(Goes without saying: R.I.P. Chuck)
B0007GAERG|1.0|i used to be a mariah fan. i still am in fact. i like all her old stuff.  <br /> <br />but this??...this? u've got to be kiddin me. this is just like any other crap that u hear on the radios these days. i am VERY <br />disappointed
B000000H66|4.0|Death was one of those bands that you couldn't help but admire, they were always \\"becoming\\" and never \\"were\\". The mastermind behind it all Chuck Schuldiner had his songwriting skills went light years forward between the first album and this one. <br /> <br />Having said all of that, looking back now 'Symbolic' certainly isn't the best Death effort. There are just far too many five star reviews here -and these must come from the most unquestioning fans. 'Individual Thought Patterns' was instantly born a classic, but what a difference two years can make. 'Symbolic' ain't bad, and in quite a few instances it really shines, but Chuck had formed another band the year before (read: Control Denied) and was maybe getting sick of the whole Death thing. <br /> <br />The year was also 1995 and what was there to listen to then? Lame washed up Seattle bands. What was there to watch? Ace Ventura...So you can see it was great that one band kept coming out with good music during this troubled period. <br /> <br />The guitars riffs are the highlight as always on Death albums. Some of the riffs are starting to get old but there is just enough change-up and new ones to keep things going fast. The solos have never sounded better from Schuldiner and Co. The bass is a huge step down from 'Individual' which featured THE MAN Steve DiGiorgio. Okay, but Chuck wisely kept skins man Gene Hoglan who delivers another fine performance here (still not as good as 'Individual'.) <br /> <br />The lyrics are weird (and insanely cryptic) as hell, but then again Chuck liked some weird stuff. Not really any bad songs on here, but of course some are better than others, i.e. \\"Symbolic\\", \\"Sacred Serenity\\", \\"1,000 Eyes\\", and \\"Misanthrope\\". Do yourself a favor though and just get the entire Death catalogue because they don't a bad album in there. <br /> <br />(R.I.P. Chuck)
B00000JZC4|2.0|I purchased the CD before the days of iTunes and other places where you could hear snippets of the tracks before buying the album.  I had heard and enjoyed \\"Take a Picture\\" and \\"Best Things\\" before buying the CD.  After a couple go-rounds of listening to it, and then, revisiting it, the CD was not what I had expected--not that bad, but, not my type of music.  Too screamy and dull at times.<br /><br />So, I wouldn't say this is a bad record, just make sure you test it out before buying.
B00005JNJT|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?  I can say \\"WOW\\", but does it carry the same emotion that everyone else speaks about?  I don't know, but for me, this was the best summer blockbuster that I have seen in 2005.  Christopher Nolan has done his homework, stayed true to dark, graphic stories that follow this hero, and set in place a cast that equally carry the weight of this film on their shoulders.  I remember saying to a friend that the reason this film worked was because of the cast.  In previous Batman films, we struggled between the over-acting of some, the celebrity status of others, and some that were just plain goofy, but now Nolan has given us a cast that carries this film into a whole new ballgame.  They want to be there, they want to embody their characters, they want to give birth to this Dark Knight, and they do.  When I first heard about this film being in the pipeline, I was concerned about Christian Bale taking on such a role that has been demolished by the heavy-hitters of Hollywood.  Could he do it?  I had faith in him, but did everyone else?  Apparently they did, because he is the most powerful representation of this tortured figure ever to come out of comic book Hollywood.  I applaud his work, appreciated his toned down approach, and cannot wait for him to come back and prove that he is this winged freak.<br /><br />Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, Tom Wilkinson, the AMAZING Cillian Murphy, Linus Roache, and Ken Watanabe.  With names like this you know that you are walking into greatness.  I was worried at first about Caine as Alfred, but with the greatest of ease he turned what could have been the comic character of the film into this powerful voice of Wayne's conscious.  It was incredible.<br /><br />While I give so much credit to the actors, I need to equally pay respect to Christopher Nolan.  Not since Sin City did I feel like I was watching a graphic novel, a comic, come alive on screen.  His ability to frame each shot like a moment in the books, create these breathing characters that you can actually believe exist, as well as tell a story that has been corrupted by the Hollywood recycling machine takes talent and Nolan did it.  I have been a huge fan of everything that Nolan has touched.  I used to give Memento out for free at the video store just so people could experience the magic that he has.  I was a fan of Insomnia and even Followers.  I get excited to see his work because it changes with each picture.  You never know what you are going to get when you watch a Nolan film, but you can guess that it will be dark and come from his heart.  I saw it in his earlier films and it shined brightly in Batman Begins.<br /><br />If I had to say anything negative about the film (which is hard to do) there would be two aspects that I would mention.  The first is Katie Holmes.  I just didn't like her character.  She was underdefined and basically eye-candy for the younger Dawson's Creek audience members.  She was worthless, perhaps it was the Tom Cruise media mud-bath that seems to have ruined our newspapers these days, but she just felt plain to me.  She didn't make the cut.  Then, there were times where you could tell that Bale was really forcing a grumbly American accent.  Nothing too wrong with this, but it just felt forced.  These were minor insecurities that I had with this overall brilliant film.<br /><br />Outstanding.  Perhaps that is a better word for it.  I could see this film again and again.  From the opening frame to the final moments of battle I was pulled from my theater seat directly into the film.  No other Batman film has done that for me.  I remember falling in love with Keaton as the Dark Knight, but I think Bale even gave him a run for his money.  Nolan created the perfect tone and story for our disturbed hero.  He took the goofy elements from Burton, erased Kilmer/Clooney, and brought us back to our roots.  This film was perfection on a stick.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****n a stick. <br /> <br />Grade: ***** out of *****
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon, creator of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" did it again, but unfortunately on a network that didn't appreciate his storytelling.  Dismissed by Fox and casual viewers as a \\"space western,\\" this thoughtful look at humanity 500 years in the future was presented out of order and incomplete by the network that commissioned and then cancelled it. <br /> <br />500 years from now, humanity has terraformed and spread to other planets in our galaxy.  Unfortunately for the colonists, they are given the bare necessities to survive.  Thus is born the framework of a \\"western\\" 500 years in the future.  Throw in a recent battle between those who wish to stay free and those who want a centralized, overpowering government, and you have the makings of a truly compelling saga. <br /> <br />Thankfully, we can see \\"Firefly\\" -- all of its episodes and in order before the release of \\"Serenity\\" in September 2005, on this wonderful DVD set.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest dramatic films I've ever seen- it is masterful in every way: cinematography, soundtrack, storyline.. a real masterpiece.<br /><br />That being said, I'd like to address some of the critics on here and offer my thoughts. I'll admit you do have to be in the right mood for this movie, or it can drag on a bit. However, if you're willing to be patient, you'll find a beautiful collage of scenery, music, and truly fine acting especially by Ralph Fiennes and William Dafoe.<br /><br />To those who say this movie is demented or silly because it glorifies adultery and the selfish whims of two morally debase people, I say you're missing the point. I think the story of the English Patient is a tragedy in the truest since of the word. Here is a guy who, like so many of us, indulged in a folly that cost him dearly. What's so sad to me is that he's so burned and mangled, all he's left with are these memories, with no way to fix it, no way to truly repent, except by confiding in his nurse. I think the main message of this film is the pain of regret. Fiennes character falls for his friend and colleagues wife, and ultimately wrecks his own life.<br /><br />For those viewers that can relate to their own regrettable actions in the past, when they were maybe younger or more foolish, I think this movie really hits close to home.
B00005JKG5|5.0|Except for Jacques, I disagree with most of the reviewers, especially the professional reviewer.  <br />Classical dance is a \\"dead art\\" anchored in the 19th century. It has no real connection to the culture of late 20th century USA. The steel industry in America - a dying industry in a dying industrialized town (Pittsburg). What is neeeded is  genius to revitalize what is now dying or irrelevant. Enter Alex. Scenes shot in the flashdance bar clearly show she is not the best dancer, her strength is somewhere else. During the course of the movie the camera dwells on the street breakdancers, the cop directing traffic, the efforts of her friend, the failed figure skater. Until the climax we never see the full dance routine for her rehearsal at the classical dance school. When we see it it's clear Alex has borrowed from everybody - the dancers at the bar, the cop, the breakdancers, her friend the skater. It's all there in the rehearsal routine. New art is born, art relevant to Americans of the late 20th century. This is what genius is. <br />When the film ends it helps some of us believe that there is hope too for Pittsburg, the steel industry, all of us.
B000002L7J|5.0|Released in mid 1985, Meat is Murder was the bands 2nd official release although in-between this and their first album the B-side collection Hatful of Hollow is often reffered to by fans as the bands second album.    It also marked the first time that the band solely produced their own album. This is perhaps why it took some fans time to adjust to the album, even alienating some. Whilst the first two releases had a raw feel to them Meat is Murder was the first time that The Smiths sounded like a studio band. In a sense Meat is Murder was a sign of things to come on their next release The Queen is Dead.    It was also the bands most controversal release not only because of the title but the front cover seemed to depict an anti war stance, which at that the time of its release was deemed very controversal and to some made The Smiths that little bit too hot to handle!!!!    The album starts of with the rumptious The Headmasters Ritual, which includes a great Johnny Marr riff incorperated with Morrisey's tale of Manchester's bording schools. Rusholme Ruffians is a song that is about something that covers most Smiths material, unrequited love, and has some humerous Smithsesque lyrics \\"What would happen if I jumped on top of a parachute?\\"    I want the one I can't have, and What she said follow in the same veign, then comes the only offical UK single release from the album That Joke isn't funny anymore, it's a beautiful track but hardly something I think would prove to be a typical track you'd hear on the radio, this perhaps explains why the song only peaked at a dissapointing 47.     And then oddly comes How soon is Now. I say oddly because it was originally on their b-side collection Hatful of Hollow and it certainly is odd on Meat is Murder it certainly doesn't belong their, and I have also discovered that after The Smiths broke up Warner brought the rights to The Smiths songs and decided when releasing The Smiths catelogue in 1992, to include How soon is Now on the Meat is Murder re-issue. I'd suggest that everyone programs their CD players to skip How soon is Now so they get a good feel of Meat is Murder as this song completly ruins the album nearly.    Nowhere Fast turns out to be the nearest Punk orientated song on the album as it's a rebellious song about how Mozza wants to drop his trousers to the Queen of England, whilst the mellow Well I wonder turns out to be one of the best especially in the excellent climatic moment when you hear rain just before the song fades out.    Barbarism begins at Home is perhaps the weirdest Smiths song ever, this is because of its obvious disco influence, it is also the first time we hear Mozza illistrate his opinions of people who eat meat, this is further metioned in the brilliant cliamx Meat is Murder, it's chilling but brilliant, supposedly this song alone changed thousands into becoming vegetarians!!!!    Overall Meat is Murder though at first weird turns out to be a great listen, it was also despite never having a UK top 40 hit their first and only number one studio album, so it should be worth buying just for that you'd think!!!!
B0009PVZWI|5.0|This 2 disc Set is AWESOME!! Some of the best stuff from Foo Fighters since \\"The Color and The Shape\\", with surefire hits such as The Last Song, Best of You and End over End. THe 2nd Disc features a really cool remake of \\"Friend of a Friend\\", which will make seasoned Foobies nostalgic... Another ballad, \\"Miracle\\" absolutely blew my socks off!! Hats off to Dave Grohl and the Foo for another great album!     (...)
B000002MIF|5.0|Released late in 1984, Hatful of Hollow was a compilation of songs left of their first album.    Only released in the UK and several other European countries, and not released in the States till 1996, the album also included the British Radio 2 Peel sessions, of songs originally released on the first Smiths album. The songs included were UK top thirty hits What difference does it make and This Charming Man, also included was Hand in Glove, Still Ill, You've got everything now, and Reel around the fountain.    The album includes the bands first UK top ten hit Heaven Knows I'm miserable now, and the UK top twenty hit William it was really nothing. It also includes the bands most famous song How soon is Now, originally a b-side to Heaven knows I'm miserable now, the song was released as a flip side in 1985 peaking in the UK at 25, it was later re-released as a single in 1992 this time charting at 16.    Though not officially an album release more a compilation, Hatful of Hollow is often refered to as the bands second album release because of top quality tracks such as Handsome Devil, These things take time, Back to the old house and a gem timed at only 1 minute 50, Please, please, please let me get what I want.    The album holds more of a Pop/Indie concept than the first album, most of the songs (except How Soon is Now, and Accept Yourself and some of the BBC outtakes) are between 2-3 minutes, e.g. Girl Afraid, These things take time. Indeed it probably works out to be the easiest Smiths album to get into (though I'd always recomend The Queen is Dead as a starting point to The Smiths)    Hatful of Hollow would peak in the UK album charts at number 7, and if anything proves that even throwaway Smiths tracks were better than most bands classics. Overall a definite must have to your Smiths and Morrisey collection.
B0006L16N8|4.0|The music over all is good but not the rockin beats I expected. If you want love songs this is the album for you :).
B00005221M|5.0|I saw this on the big screen when it came out and was I ever happy that it came out in DVD! I use this film when I have to cover the French & Indian War in my class. It really helps in visualizing what it must of been like \\"Back in the days\\" and what people look like who live in the field. My students have always had a positive view of this film.
B000002N2P|4.0|I won't say that \\"Insomniac\\" is their best album, but I will say that it's easily my favorite. It rocks all the way through, all 32 minutes of it. I also have to admit, that of all the songs on here, I really do like the hits the most. \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" is completely addictive, and \\"Walking Contradiction\\" is pop-punk perfection. Of course the rest is killer as well, like \\"Stuck With Me\\", \\"Panic Song\\", and \\"Bab's Uvula Who?\\". These guys may have been knocked for becoming too popular, but there's no doubt they are talented, and almost solely responsible for bringing punk into the 90's and beyond. Let them make your (green) day.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Given their Beatles/Stones-like aspirations to immortality, it's amazing that Oasis dried up so quickly.  But this disjointed, repetitive album reveals a band completely scorched of life.  The only sadder 'comeback' attempt out there now is that of the Backstreet Boys.  Stick with the band's first two releases.  Or better yet, stick with the Beatles and the Stones.
B000002J1M|5.0|Foxtrot(1972) is a mixed bag. 5 out of the 6 songs are great but there is a filler between Can-Utility and the Coastliners and Super's Ready Called Horizon's. This song is a guitar instrumental that sounds like a practise session. Anyway, the album starts out with WATCHER OF THE SKIES, which is one of the better songs on the album except for the dated intro that sounds like Phantom of the Opera. It is a fast song with some great keys by Tony Banks. Next comes the suttle TIME TABLE that starts with a piano and the Phil comes in with a quiet jazz beat. As the song reaches the chorus, it starts to sound like a the early Seven Stones. GET EM' OUT BY FRIDAY is one of the worst songs on the album. It's a Hogweed-type song but drags. CAN-UTILITY AND THE COASTLINERS is a peaceful song with great keyboards and great 12-string guitar. I already talked about HORIZON'S so I'll move on the the grand finale, the magnum opus, the 23-minute long SUPPER'S READY. Best Genesis song yet. All seven parts of it are great, but my favourites are LOVER'S LEAP, WILLOW FARM, and AS SURE AS EGGS IS EGGS(ACHING MEN'S FEET). ALL in all, great album.
B00078XGRO|5.0|Star Trek the Next Generation has always been my favorite series of all the Star Trek spinoffs.  All the episodes with the Borg were so exciting, scary, and thrilling.  The fights between the crew of the Enterprise and the Borgs during this movie was so thrilling, exciting, and scary.  Besides battling the awful Borg, having to protect the past so that the Vulcans can make first contact with the human race is not an easy feat.   <br /> <br />In other words, this movie has it all: action, adventure, some comedy (when Data puts the doctor Beverly overboard, that was priceless how funny it was), and drama.   <br /> <br />This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|For Windows users, go to the start menu, then click \\"Run.\\" Type: REGEDIT. Or, for 2000/NT users (or even XP!) type, \\"REGEDT32.EXE\\", which brings up even more advanced options. <br /> <br />From here, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then CURRENT SETTINGS, then SERVICE, then CDROM. Click on CDROM and it will open a menu on the right side of the page. Double click on AUTORUN and set the function to 0 (it should be set at 1). Exit, then restart your system. <br /> <br />This disables autorun permanently, and prevents the annoying MediaMax software from launching when you insert the CDs into your drive. <br /> <br />If this is too complicated for you, an alternative is to hold down the shift key after inserting the disc - but this is a less proven method and if timed incorrectly will do nothing. <br /> <br />It's wise to disable autorun because some CDs can contain viruses or hidden spyware that automatically install onto your PC. Many CDs and videogames have disclaimers (the kind you never read), once you sign it, it gives them permission to install software on your machine -- MediaMax (included on the \\"In Your Honor\\" and \\"Velvet Revolver: Contraband\\" CDs) has a similar user agreement. It pops up via autorun, and asks you to sign an agreement. It then installs a file under Windows that prevents you from ripping tracks off the CD into your iPod and, for Windows Media Player users, doesn't let you rip tracks through the program. <br /> <br />It's a pain, and also a shame that the CD companies are resorting to silly tactics like this - it's not right. In my opinion if you're paying fifteen bucks for a CD you shouldn't have to be tricked into installing a nasty file onto your PC, then be restricted from copying tracks you rightfully purchased to your portable media device. <br /> <br />If you disagree to the autorun disclaimer, the MediaMax software ejects the CD from your drive and doesn't allow you to play the songs until you click \\"yes.\\" I think that's scary - they're practically forcing you to install stuff on your computer. <br /> <br />A college student posted a how-to guide similar to my own here and was sued for millions by MediaMax. It's not right. Users who purchase computers and music CDs have every right to do what they wish with their drive options; just because MediaMax wants you to sign an agreement doesn't mean they should be allowed to sue a helpless student because he's pointing out a basic function of Windows XP that all users should understand to begin with. <br /> <br />And then they complain when people illegally download music? They can't have their cake and eat it, too. <br /> <br />As for my review of the CD \\"In Your Honor,\\" I really like it. The first disc (electric) is better than the second disc. There are other more comprehensive reviews here on Amazon written by helpful commentators, which explain more in-depth about the songs. <br /> <br />I hope this helps you burn tracks to your iPod!
B0002ZEYYQ|2.0|What happened to the band I love?  This album marks a true low point in Jamiroquai's history as well as possibly the declared date of the death of \\"Acid Jazz\\".  The downfall, which started with Stu Zenders (bass) departure, ends with the departure of Toby Smith (keys). The band known as Jamiroquai today is a faint reminder of the power-house they used to be with the only original member,Jay Kay, being left driving this out-of-control coked-up train to lord knows where.  <br /> <br />The album: Fans have seen it coming since Synkronized.  Jay has traded in soul for disco, funk for techno, ecology for fast cars, weed for coke, digeredoos for synthesizers, complexity for simplicity, musicians for performers.  With the exception of no more than three tracks on this album (that give me hope incidentally), as a whole the album feels like an over produced underwritten attempt at capturing pop success.  Where's that \\"Inter-planetary\\" good times vibe that made Jay and his band such a draw in the nineties?  I don't want to hear a single that will make it on a dancefloor remix.  I want to hear that soulful boogie with fat bass lines and driving keyboards that made the first three albums extraordinary. On a positive note, Talulah comes close to recreating that early vibe that needs to be revived.  <br /> <br />My apologies to any die-hard fans I might offend.  I wish Jay the best in his physical, mental, and musical rehabilitation.  I would like nothing more than to see Jay, Toby, Stu, Wallace, and Nick join forces and play on the same stage again.  Being a realist, I will settle for the first three albums cut by the band and try to tuck this one in the back of the CD catalog.
B000268QB2|5.0|The first time I've heard of Keane is one morning on VH1 with their video \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and I thought, \\"Wow! I like this!\\" but after doing what VH1 & MTV does best to great songs they overplayed it. But that also sparked my curiosity about this band. So, I did some research and ended up on Amazon reading reviews and listening to 30-second clips of their songs but they didn't do anything special to me. I first thought they were a bit bland and them being compared to the likes of Coldplay (who can also sometimes be bland) didn't convince me at all. But Keane would not leave me alone. When \\"Everybody's Changing\\" was released, I thought it was a good single, catchy but not good enough to be released. Nevertheless, having heard the infectious \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" multiple times followed by an OK second single, I urged myself to borrow \\"Hopes and Fears\\" from the local library 'cause I was hesistant of buying it and hating myself for doing so. I wasn't even that thrilled once I checked it out because I honestly was just expecting some sleepy Euro-pop after \\"Somewhere Only We Know.\\" But I was completely beyond wrong. They are nothing like Coldplay. At one time, I sort of forced myself to like Coldplay and I still never got to like them; I didn't have to with Keane. The 30-second samples on Amazon don't do them justice and should never ever be the basis when deciding. The following tracks are as infectious and melodic as the first single. \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is one of those albums that really takes no time growing on you for the first listen is enough to get you hooked. And though some of the songs may sound the same on the first listen, you'll eventually find out that each song has a unique distinction that makes them stand out and recognizable. I didn't have a problem with it, sometimes it's better an album to be that way to have a continuous flow.     To end this review, I leave you with the album highlights: \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" \\"This Is The Last Time,\\"\\"We Might As Well Be Strangers,\\" \\"She Has No Time,\\" \\"Can't Stop Now,\\" and \\"Bedshaped\\" are the gems of this album. They define the music of Keane. Eventually, you will like most of the songs, if not, all. I am and will be expecting a lot of great things from this band and I hope that their next album will be as good and strong or even better than \\"Hopes and Fears.\\"    8.5/10
B000683VI4|5.0|I had zero desire to see this last summer in the theater but ended up going w/my parents on a trip home.  It's not perfect but it packs a wallop, mainly because of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.  They commit themselves fully and their performances are incredibly moving.  Yes, Gena Rowlands and James Garner are reliable and deliver good work, but it's Gosling and McAdams who make you believe in the story.  I don't care how tough or macho you think you may be; if you even have one shred of romantic sensibility, you'll be swept up by The Notebook.  And you'll bite your lip, call yourself a sucker, and clench your fists during some of the less subtle moments because you'll know, deep down, that this is one of the finest love stories you've ever seen.
B0000020C4|5.0|\\"Les Miserables\\" is a marvelous musical; a stunningly faithful interpretation of Victor Hugo's masterpiece, with an inspiring storyline and unforgettable characters.  There are 2 reasons for buying a Les Mis CD - (1) you've seen a performance and want ONE CD to remind you of it or (2) you've become a les Mis junkie (like me) and want multiple versions so you too can hold forth on the rival merits of Andy Warlow vs Michael Maguire, Patty LuPone vs Ruthie Henshaw, Frances Ruffelle vs Kaho Shimada vs Lea Solonga.  Whichever category you are in, you really, REALLY want the Tenth Anniversary Concert.  The TAC has the complete storyline (albeit slightly abridged), it was recorded live (so there's an unique intensity and chemistry between performers), and from top to bottom it has BY FAR the best cast.  I have all 4 full-length, English-language versions (Original London Cast, Original Broadway Cast and Complete Symphonic Recording in addition), but this is the one I listen to over and over.     Colm Wilkinson (OLC, OBC and TAC) is and will always be THE definitive Jean Valjean.  OK, he has a unique singing style, but such heart.  Not always perfect, but so powerful and emotional.  All his solos just stop me dead in my tracks.  The sweetness and purity of his \\"Bring Him Home\\" and \\"Epilogue\\" move me to tears.  Remember that Jean Valjean is in his 50's and 60's for most of the action. Wilkinson still has the voice, but manages to convey the authority, experiences and suffering of a lifetime.  Gary Morris (CSR) sounds too young (and petulant).    Finally, a Javert (Philip Quast) who can hold his own with Wilkinson in \\"Confrontation\\". Quast`s Javert is the implacable Angel of Justice -the evil of self-righteousness, but yet more complex under the surface. \\"Stars\\" and \\"Javert's suicide\\" soar.  Roger Allam (OLC) has a fine voice, but is not nearly as powerful (or sinister).   Terrance Mann (OBC) is overmatched by Wilkinson in \\"Confrontation\\" (as Morris is by Quast on the CSR) and struggles with his solos.    Michael Ball (also on the OLC and CSR) is an outstanding Marius. Emotional without melodrama, he makes that nave, lovelorn man believable, passionate and sympathetic.  \\"Empty Chairs At Empty Tables\\" is powerful and moving.  The less said about Davis Bryant (OBC) the better.    Each of the 4 versions of Les Mis has its own Fantine, leaving lots of room for debate.  Personally, I love Ruthie Henshall's portrayal.  Her voice is rich and beautiful.  Her Fantine is a woman who has suffered a great deal, but is still undefeated.  A case can definitely be made for Patty LuPone (OLC) who created the role and sings it with great sadness and power.  Debra Bryne's (CSR) Fantine is fragile and poignant, but not the sort of woman who could fight back when Bamatabois abused her or spit in the face of the Mayor.  Randy Graff (OBC) just wails.     A lively debate also rages about the character of Eponine.  Frances Ruffelle created the role and did a credible job with the OLC, but for some reason decided to whine and shriek on the OBC.   I know that Eponine is described as having a harsh (not shrill) voice by Hugo, but that doesn't mean concert goers should be tortured.  I find Kaho Shimada (CSR) uneven and unremarkable.  Lea Solonga towers over both of them; her voice is lovely, pure and soaring, with an edge of anger and bitterness.  This is an Eponine capable of facing down an entire band of cutthroats, and of tricking the man she loves to his death at the barricade because she can't have him.  I don't understand why she has to be shot by accident instead of being allowed to die saving Marius's life.    Andy Warlow (CSR) is widely acclaimed as the best Enjorlas, with a fine, powerful, deep voice. (Indeed, I bought the CSR to hear him.) However, Michael Maguire (TAC and OBC) also turns in an outstanding performance, Even Warlow doesn't match the intensity of Maguire's entrance in \\"One Day More\\" or \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\".  He is totally believable as a leader who could inspire his followers to follow him to their deaths.    Judy Kuhn is a lovely Cossette (truly a `soulful songbird').  Jenny Galloway and Alum Armstrong (the Trenardiers) are sly and humorous. Hannah Chick (Young Cosette) and Adam Searles (Gavroche, who is SUPPOSED to be 12 in 1832) are both delightful.    Another true joy of the TAC is the quality of the voices in the minor roles, leading constantly to little moments of delight where the commonplace unexpectedly becomes magical.  Two of the convicts (Phil Cavill and Jeff Layton) are actually there for the International Parade of Jean Valjeans.  Paul Monaghan as the Bishop is truly powerful and moving, capable of turning Jean Valjean's life around.  Gareth Snook (Bamatabois) is delightfully sinister.  Christopher Howard (as the Lancer at the barricade) is martial and dramatic.  All of the students, led by Anthony Crivello as Grantaire, are outstanding.  \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" and \\"\\"Drink With Me\\" are extremely moving.  And accompanying it all, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  The aching clarinet in \\"The Sewers\\" is worth the price of admission by itself.    The TAC clocks in at 40 minutes longer than either the OLC or the OBC and contains almost all of the scenes necessary so the action does flow. How could you really follow the story line without Valjean's confrontations with Javert when the cart overturns, at the barricade or in the sewers?  It is about 30 minutes shorter than the CSR, accomplished mainly by trimming lines throughout (Fantine only sells her hair, not her hair and locket). One advantage is that the entire silliness about a brand on Jean Valjean's chest is eliminated.  Would I prefer that it had the complete score? Of course!  I'd prefer it to go on as long as possible.  But the bottom line for me is that the performances are so much superior, that there is no contest about which CD you should get first.  (Plus you get the amazing sight of 17 international actorswho've portrayed Jean Valjean singing \\"Do You Hear the People sing?\\" each in their native language.)
B0007KTAU4|4.0|Every review says the same: she is hot and she sings. Ok, thats right, and thats great. but there are more things. she has a beautiful voice and its great listening to her. i know there are better things in life and she isnt the best singer in human history. but shes great, and i guess thats enough.
B00008G9JN|5.0|I give Ian Anderson credit for daring and imagination.  In 1975 Ian Anderson moved to the country.  A former PR man, Jo Lustig, buys Ian a book on British folklore and legends.  Suddenly Ian Anderson creates an album inspired by his surroundings and the book, and \\"Songs from the Wood\\" is born.  Even better, Jethro Tull returns to experimenting with musical themes and styles, turning their backs on the heady commercial success of \\"Agualung\\" and \\"Warchild.\\"  The result is interesting and fun.  For those of us who enjoy an eclectic collection of uncommon music, it is a must for our collection.<br /><br />The opening track is the title song.  The lilting opening sets the tone of the album and provides an intriguing entry into the fanciful worlds sung by Jethro Tull.  The words are initially sung without musical accompaniment.  Then the song kicks into folk style.  The folk style then transitions into progressive-sounding rock during the extended bridge.  After the bridge the style changes back to a folk style that is powered by rock instruments.  This song promises the CD will be interesting.<br /><br />The second song has its roots in Pagan mythology.  \\"Jack-in-the-Green\\" is referred to by many names, including The Hidden One, the Cylenchar, Green Jack and Green George.  Jack-in-the-Green was protector and nurturer of the woods.  This song has a style that is based in folk, and asks the musical question whether Jack still exists in this modern world of cars and power lines.<br /><br />The following song ties in the previous song and a later song.  \\"Cup of Wonder\\" refers to a variety of Pagan rituals, including \\"Beltane,\\" which evolved into May Day.  There are a couple of ways to interpret this folk-rock song.  One way has dark overtones.  The other, which I think is in line with the tone of the album, is to interpret the references as being celebratory and fun.  Thus the \\"cup of crimson wonder\\" is probably a cup of wine.  This song is interesting and unusual.<br /><br />The song \\"Hunting Girl\\" is incredibly sexual, with barely concealed imagery.  Indeed much of the imagery is not concealed at all.  Once again the style is folk-rock.  The song has a high-born woman taking advantage of a low-born peasant; a peasant who would likely find himself in serious trouble if someone else were to happen upon the pair as they lay in the field.<br /><br />In \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells\\" Ian Anderson tells of the celebration of the winter solstice.  This song is interesting because it makes references to Druids, who were Celtic priests, and yet the Celts did not celebrate the winter solstice (at least, my brief research appears to indicated they did not).  The song is still fun and enjoyable in the context of this album, but it may be historically inaccurate.<br /><br />If the song \\"Velvet Green\\" were written a few hundred years ago it would be funny, because part of the song is an attempt by a young man to convince a young woman to make love to him.  This song would thus imply that guys have changed little in hundreds of years, which is likely in any case.  The heart of the song is being close to nature, literally and figuratively, and the discussion of the tryst seems to emphasize how intimate the relationship with nature should be.<br /><br />The next song is an interesting song and difficult for me to interpret.  The folk style of \\"The Whistler\\" seems to me to describe the character of the singer, who is a minstrel of some type.  Jethro Tull has a similar song in \\"Minstrel in the Gallery,\\" though that song was less folk and more rock.  The only words that are confusing are those of the first stanza, which make the song sound like a love song.  Perhaps the first stanza is a warning that if you submit to his whiles you will not get him to stay.<br /><br />\\"Pibroch (Hat in Hand)\\" is a sad song.  A man has traveled to his true love's house, perhaps to ask her for marriage.  However, when he gets there another has arrived ahead of him.  A \\"pibroch\\"is a dirge, and this rock-flavored folk music is very dirge-like, with deep organ and bass.  Even when the music changes to a lighter tone, the sound is like a scolding.  This song is one of the most creative and imaginative on this CD.<br /><br />The original ending to the CD was \\"Fire at Midnight,\\" which celebrates relaxing by the fire with his love at the end of a long hard, day.  This song is sung minstrel-like, which is often how I see Ian Anderson.  Perhaps he styles himself as a minstrel as well.<br /><br />This re-mastered CD contains two additional songs.  The first is \\"Beltane,\\" a song about celebration of the Celtic festival Beltane.  Beltane was either the biggest Celt festival, or one of the biggest, and was celebrated on May Day.  The song uses the festival to promote closeness to nature.  The song also makes reference to the \\"green man,\\" the subject of the second song.<br /><br />The last track is a live version of \\"Velvet Green.\\"  From the viewpoint that this additional track helps fill the time available on the CD it is a positive addition.  The small variations from the studio version are interesting, but the song feels a little bit out of place.<br /><br />There are other groups that have attempted folk-rock with a Celtic theme.  However, Jethro Tull did it with unique combinations of instruments, vocals and styles, and every time I hear Ian Anderson, I am always reminded of a medieval bard or minstrel.  \\"Songs from the Wood\\" keeps the promise of rock music to be sufficiently flexible to encompass any style.  I wish there were more groups in the world who would attempt to create music that is new and refreshing while being somewhat melodic.  More than 25 years after this album was recorded it still sounds new and original.  There are few albums that can claim that.im.

B0007P3582|1.0|There is quite a bit of lackluster things happening right now in hip-hop and it seems like an artist like 50 Cent is ready to capitalize on it because he can. I enjoyed his previous album, his producers are a lot more talented than he is here, and this album DEFINES \\"style over substance\\". Where lines on his first album were clever and catchy they are afterthought at best on 'The Massacre'. Instead of making an artistic statement, 50 would rather make a meaningless album with songs that are either cheesy in the vein of \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" or generic sex garbage in the vein of \\"Candy Shop\\", which is a re-write of \\"Magic Stick\\" which he made with Lil' Kim a couple years ago. Oh, but it's not the exact same song, so no one will notice. Then there's crap like materialism, which never really impressed me. Or vile, or name-dropping other artists so that we'll care. The fact that he made 22 of these songs is near inexcusible. I mean, the beats are great, but there is more than beats. The songs I like are only songs I like because of their beats and not much from 50's uninteresting flow and lyrics. I say that you could skip this one. He does have backlash but it's for a very good reason. <br /> <br />Even though I say that there's a lot of flaws, there is also more than a handful of current hip-hop that I would say is a better choice. The Game's album is better than either of his and look at the other albums Dre produced.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|From the first scene onwards you can't help but notice the dynamic resemblance between the perennial voluptuous, erotic & tantalizing cyber chic & Angelina Jolie; she was born to play that part. Lara Croft has for many years lived in the fantasy of many gamers but now with her embodiment as Angelina they have someone to relate to.<br /><br />Most of the movie stayed true to the game unlike many game-to-movies flicks nothing was jeopardized maybe because the game was so perfect in its fictitious depiction of a fantasy world, not to mention no shortage of exotic locations as well as conspiracies, urban legends, myths & human paranoia.<br /><br />This movie is the quintessential pop-corn flick, complete with dim-witted yet attitudinal villains, tense & exciting action scenes, futuristic gadgets & an inconsequential romantic interlude.<br /><br />Verdict: thoroughly enjoyable. A great movie for Tomb Raider fans or moviegoers alike. Angelina Jolie is a virtual incarnation of the Cyber goddess. A Pop-corn flick galore.<br /><br />Rating: 3 & ½ stars.
B0008ISM40|5.0|He really does, when you look at the previous lp's (note: I do not mean ep/ remix cds such as broken, fixed etc etc) such as the complicated \\"noise\\" ( I mean this in a positive way not negative) that is The Fragile, the thought provoking/ hate fueled album that is The Downward Spiral and the oldest of them all \\" Pretty Hate Machine\\" which seems pretty much like a young guy still trying to find out what he thinks of the world he lives in. All have different sounds, different ideas, yet share one common factor. They're all brilliant, for different reasons but brilliant all the same. That brings us to the newest offering given to us from Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor. WHen I bought this cd on May 3rd 2005, I made one error, that was going into the listening looking for something I had already heard. I wanted a more angry version of Pretty Hate Machine. Something along the Lines of Pretty Hate Machine meets Broken, obviously when I heard this I was dissapointed. So I put it down for a little while and after giving it a few more listens it all of a sudden didn't stand in the shadows of its 3 older siblings. While different it is still Nine Inch Nails just not repeating themselves over and over. ( which is where numerous bands run into trouble) Love this album for what it is not what it isn't.<br /><br />All the Love in the World - 4/5 While I exspected this album to start out with a knockout punch to the face, this song felt more like a wet sponge to the face. A pretty slow song I didn't like at all at first, I warmed up to it later.<br /><br />You Know What you are? - 10/5 Now this is what i'm talking about, one of the best songs here, has everything you could ask for, has some really haunting keyboards in the chorus, definetly a song I could see being a favorite for concerts<br /><br />The Collector - 4.5/5 Starts out slow, the drum intro is a little long, lyrics aren't perfect but the vocals in the chorus make up for it all. The guitar is also impressive.<br /><br />The Hand That Feeds - 5/5 Just what a bunch of foolish angst fueled \\"gothic\\" kids want, sadly this gets played alot on mtv2 and alot of stereotypes got into nin through this. Not bad at all though, I can easily see why it is a single.<br /><br />Love is not Enough - 4/5 I exspected this song to be a little more happier and such but it starts out with a dense drum intro and Trent speaking the lyrics and not singing i nthe first 30 seconds or so. The synth works quite well here. Alot darkier than the four previous songs.<br /><br />Every day is Exactly the Same - 10/5 another favorite, just Trent Reznor's voice in this song is hypnotizing, the drums work really well for this song, lyrics are quite touching. Definetly one of the best.<br /><br />With Teeth - 4.5/5 A.K.A. [AWITHA_ATEETHA] (if you read the Meathead section of the nin hotline.com you will know what i'm talking about) One of the heaviest tracks on this album, its all about atmosphere and that is just what the music does.<br /><br />Only - 6/5 second single, has a pretty funky drum intro that I enjoy, with great keyboards as well mixed with Trent's thought provoking lyrics/ good vocals make this song one of the most importan here. Do not skip this one.<br /><br />Getting Smaller - 4.5/5 starts out with some pretty distorted guitar and some what fast drumming, definetly a good song but Mr. Reznot couldn't we all have done without the lyrics \\"flip flop, flip flop\\"?<br /><br />Sunspots - 4.5/5 pretty mellow intro and an odd name for a song, or so I believe so, Trent has some great singing here, makes this song worth it.<br /><br />The Line Begins to Blur - 4.5/5 Trent's vocals seem like they're being shouted atleast 20 feet from the mic in parts of the song, I truly love the guitar in this one, some of the best on this album. Has a bit of an \\"epic\\" feeling near the end.<br /><br />Beside you in time - 4/5 starts out with some odd drum sound you would probably here on The Fragile, a some what of a mellow song, Trent sings this one in almsot a whisper.<br /><br />Right Where it Belongs - 20/5 Could be the best on here, the perfect Nin ballad, while not quite up there with the incredible \\"Hurt\\" the keyboards are just incredible  and I enjoy playing them, definetly a song nin would close a concert with. This song is reason enough to buy this album.<br /><br />So, to end this. Does it sound like previous nin albums? No but does it stand on its own? Yes it does and is worthy of a spot in your Nine Inch Nails collection. Enjoy.Fragile, a some what of a mellow song, Trent sings this one in almsot a whisper. <br /> <br />Right Where it Belongs - 20/5 Could be the best on here, the perfect Nin ballad, while not quite up there with the incredible \\"Hurt\\" the keyboards are just incredible  and I enjoy playing them, definetly a song nin would close a concert with.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm not going to write a long review, I just thought i'd help put the album back at the top where it deserves to be.  Here's something fun; I just tried this the other day...If you have any type of a surround sound stereo system in your house you MUST listen to Ok Computer on it.  Me and a friend sat in the center of the living room surrounded by lush guitars, muliple Thom York's, and lots of other things you just can't hear as well on the regular left and right channel stereos.  Anyways, yes!! Ok Computer for president!!!!
B000007O9L|5.0|The album title says it all - The Stones in \\"stripped down\\" mode ... and, boy, is it excellent! <br /> <br />This has got to be their most intimate album ever recorded.  Listening to it honestly makes me feel like I've got a front row seat in the nightclub where it was recorded .... and loving every moment of the sounds coming out of my speakers. <br /> <br />Good job, fellas ... 7th live album or 1-6, this one's a keeper! <br /> <br />
B00006AW2F|1.0|As a die hard Stones fan (I even like Dirty Work) I am positively STUNNED at how many reviewers actually LIKE this album. None of these throwaways sound as good ANYTHING on Steel Wheels, Voodoo Lounge or Bridges (just check out the Soundscan numbers, kids- all the aforementioned albums sold WAAAYYY more copies than Metamorphacrap, so clearly I am NOT alone). The only tracks worth anything are Jivin Sister Fanny (but a better version exists on the bootlegs with a far more enthused band) and I'm Going Down, which has the misfortune to have been written and performed by Mick Taylor and Steven Stills, so we will never ever hear this performed live (yes that is NOT Keith on guitar) and that's a SHAME.<br /><br /> Say what you want about the Stones' recent material, but it still sells more copies and sounds far better than this excuse for an album. Metamorphosis is what it is- a cash-in on REJECTED material that belongs in a coffin, not a cd player.<br /><br />Gotta go find Voodoo Lounge and crank You Got Me Rockin.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Allegedly this is the last Foo album we may ever see...true or not, this is an amazing album.  When I'd first heard the single, it reeked of power and struck a chord with me I'd never felt in my life.  The video evoked nothing but the same emotion and I listened to nothing but the foo fighters for a few days.  Now that the cd is mine (bought it the day it came out), dissapointed I am NOT.  I love this album to death and have told all my friends to buy it. <br />Track 1 is a powerful, great intro track. (In Your Honor) <br />No Way Back, DOA, The Last Song, The Deepest Blues are Black- all absolutely amazing and will be stuck in your head and consistently warranting a replay.  The whole first disc is quite an experience. <br />The second cd is incredible...but at the same time a let down.  Some of the songs sound the same...and the lyrics are...meh.  But Tracks 2, 3, & 8 are absolutely insane and incredible.  There are more tracks I love, but those three are the ones I have been able to completely fall in love with. <br />You'd be hard pressed to find a better rock album this year in this genre.  The first disc alone is worth your money...and while the second disc lacks, it's still great to turn on and just relax to while you're online...out in a hammock...or just chillin out.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Michael Mann has proved to be a consistently impressive source of film-making over the last quarter century. Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider show him at his most versatile and entertaining and are modern classics in their own right. Despite his efforts, he has not enjoyed the amount of box-office success and recognition he deserves. Collateral, his latest project, made great strides in finally brining Mann to the forefront of modern cinematic directors. Not only is it his most accessible film to date, it strongly showcases his greatest strength of creating an engaging storyline with engaging characters. The two leads are perfectly cast, with Cruise going drastically against type as the remorseless Vincent and Foxx matching him stride for stride as the helpless Max.<br /><br />The two share a unique, strained bond that makes their final showdown both inevitable and gripping. Above it all, Mann's unmistakable flair for his craft shines through. In the hands of a less experienced director, Collateral would have been another run-of-the-mill clich&eacute;d action vehicle. Thanks to the careful hand of Mann and the pitch perfect performances from Cruise and Foxx, it rises above the normal expectations of the genre and comes through as a fresh and original thrill ride. It's truly one of the year's best.
B00000ILGL|5.0|During the late seventies, disco was becoming more experimental. Artist and/or producers were incorporating various sounds/elements to the pulsating beat. From rock to nostalgic 40's style music, disco was taking on different forms. But there were very few artist who best exemplfied this type of experimentation. Point in case, In regards to electronic disco, Giorgio Moroder was at the top of his game, creating this melodic electronic masterpiece in 1977, and in the process, setting the blue print for electronic dance music. FROM HERE TO ETERNITY contains some of the most hypnotic, infecious disco music ever conceived. From the title track to the albums concluding track &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;, this is synthized disco at it's best! FROM HERE TO ETERNITY has retained its freshness after so many years! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0316172324|5.0|Malcom Gladwell has done an outstanding job examining a little understood process.  While we all realize that we make many snap decisions, Gladwell looks beneath this simple fact to uncover how we make these decisions and when we make them poorly.<br /><br />He discusses four primary mechanisms:<br /><br />1.  Our ability to recognize a signature that pervades a person's behavior or an object's coherence.<br /><br />2.  Our ability to strip away unimportant information to make snap decisions -- or conversely to be confused by too much information.<br /><br />3.  Our inability to make clear decisions when confronted with our built in prejudices.<br /><br />4.  Our inability to make clear decisions when forced to make decisions too quickly in unfamiliar situations.<br /><br />Gladwell uses stories about real people to illustrate all these behaviors and thus gives us the ability to recognize new situations where our ability to make \\"Blink\\" decisions may be helpful or compromised.<br /><br />The stories themselves are also fascinating, for example there is a professor who can analyze 15 minutes of conversation between a couple and predict, with 90% accuracy, whether they will be divorced in 15 years.  Blink explains how he does this in clear and entertaining language.  A great read.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I really can't do much but repeat what a lot of other people have already said.  So for anyone who hasn't bought this album or doesn't feel like sifting through some 700-odd reviews, here's all you need to know: <br /> <br />\\"Coldplay released a new album.  It's by U2 and Radiohead.\\" <br /> <br />This can either be a good, bad, or incredibly irritating depending on whether or not you're already a fan of any of these bands.  With the exception of \\"Fix You\\" (which seems to be an incredibly hit-or-miss track among reviewers on this site), there is nothing on this album that hasn't been done before (and better) by U2 and Radiohead.  There are times during certain songs where you have to do a double take to make sure you didn't shuffle in \\"OK Computer.\\"  In the opening track, \\"Square One\\", there is more or less an exact rip of U2's \\"New Years Day.\\"  The similarities are uncanny.   <br /> <br />If you don't already have these records, buy Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\", and Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  If you're familiar with all of these albums, feel free to drop $15 on \\"X&Y\\", give it a couple of listens, and sell it while the resale value is high.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album was often hailed as the pinnacle of modern rock, and I can't definitively disagree. I haven't heard an album more complete and diverse. More soul-crushing and redemptive at once. This is Radiohead's crowning work, in my opinion, and it really does get me that at present it has less than four stars as a rating. <br /> <br />The recording is the voice of a universe on the edge of the future. In my opinion, the music depicts the modern world staring at the monsters it has created -- the danger of everything that the world has come to be. But it is also an immensely personal record, venturing into the fear and joy of trying to deal with a future so foreign and inexplicable that it defies everything you have ever known. The journey can't be nailed down -- but it works on many different layers. <br /> <br />OK Computer starts out with Airbag, a hardline musical bomb about the moment right after one has avoided a car accident. The buzzing guitar, soaring in and out of dissonance, matches an expertly-sampled drumtrack and Thom Yorke's beautiful wail. \\"I am born again,\\" Yorke calls repeatedly, a resurrection from a kink in the system. The scream of an individual. The second track is Paranoid Android, possibly the band's most revered song. An epic that pairs absolute rock chops with stunning harmonic stretches. The lyrics, again, are daggers at the hearts of many things -- Radiohead are open to interpretation. Paranoid Android has been touted as an epic about Rome, a story about Yorke's encounter with cokehead yuppie boors, and a parable about modern values. Which one is it? It doesn't really matter. However you read it, it hits you just as hard when an achingly beautiful vocal section is cut down by an immensely striking line: \\"God loves His children, God loves His children, yeah\\" spat out with such utter irony and contempt that you can't help but be affected. The lasershot guitar punch that follows seems very fitting. <br /> <br />The next section of the album involves a nice little piece on considering the unknown -- and the unknown considering you (Subterranean Homesick Alien). The atmosphere really is great here, even though this isn't necessarily the strongest song on the album. Exit Music (For A Film) is the next song, and it is another stunner. Beginning with just acoustic guitar and haunting vocals, it progresses into an infinitely creepy and gorgeous ode to what seems to be a desperate love in souring times. Let Down, the fifth track, is one of the most upbeat songs on the album, marked by a wonderful vocal line (especially in a third verse harmonic overdubbing) and remarkable lyrics. The ache is there, shrouded in disappointment and the dullness of life, but in that ache is this amazing howl of human will -- that \\"one day / I am gonna grow wings.\\" It sounds trite until you hear it. <br /> <br />The middle of the album contains Karma Police, a popular piano piece with an interesting chord sequence and matching lyrics (though I personally don't listen to it as much as other songs on the record). Also featured is the atmospheric Fitter Happier, with a robotic voice that echoes the world's repression of humanity into a predictable little package. <br /> <br />Next are two of the darker songs on OKC: Electioneering and Climbing Up The Walls. Electioneering, perhaps the track I turn to least on the record, is a loud stab of a song, whereas Climbing Up The Walls is a scary number on paranoia and insanity. An inescapable horror at every stop. <br /> <br />After this venture into darkness, the final three tracks tie OKC to a close with gleams of humanity through the hull of oppressive spirits. No Surprises is an ironically placid number which sparkles and asks sardonically for \\"the quiet life / with no alarms and no surprises please.\\" Lucky is about the closest that OKC gets to producing a love song -- it's a great call for love from someone who is trying to hold onto his optimism. \\"I feel my luck could change,\\" Yorke explains, before crying for help. The wonderful chorus line of \\"Pull me out of the aircrash / pull me out of the lake / cause I'm your superhero\\" is a look at how love operates -- the idea of a helpless superhero is a potent one. And the final track, The Tourist, ebbs with a wandering need to go somewhere in life -- even if you're not sure where it is you're headed. <br /> <br />This album is philosophical, beautiful, challenging music. Prog rock? Maybe. But definitions are petty. With all of the sweeping majesty of Wall-era Floyd and all of the lyrical prowess of modern rock heroes like U2 or Beck, Radiohead have really made a masterpiece with OK Computer. And that is no exaggeration. <br />

B00005JNTX|5.0|Of all the comic-book movies that have been made, from Flash Gordon to The Fantastic Four in 2005, this is liable to score a premier spot in the `fan satisfaction' division. No niggling here along the lines of \\"Spider-Man shouldn't have organic web-shooters\\" or \\"Batman's parents shouldn't be shot by the Joker\\". This collaboration between two one-man bands, comic-book writer-artist Frank Miller and director-writer producer Robert Rodriguez, is as authentic to the source material as those cheapo '60s Marvel cartoons that panned over panels from the caricatures while narrative artists read out the word balloons.<br /><br />Like most flourishing comics, Sin City created a decipherable concrete-but-unreal humanity. Miller mixed a stew of thugs in trench coats out of Chandler or Spillane, a spice of the `bad girl art' that made paperback covers of the 1950s stand out from newsracks and a splatter of the manga-ish stylized goriness which encouraged movies buffs like Quentin Tarantino (who guest-directs one scene) have only recently discovered. The movie candidly matches the look of the comic: stark black-and-white images, with the occasional shocking or beautiful splash of rich color. Most modern noirs incline to the blacker side of monochrome, but Miller's scratchboard techniques, custom-made superbly by Rodriguez, often get the most impact out of white - the blank round reflections of a killer's sunglasses, crosses of sticking-plaster on a much-wounded face, arterial gushes of opaque blood.<br /><br />The movie script also matches the original stories virtually word for word. The original mini-series was about Marv (perfectly incarnated here by comeback kid Mickey Rourke) a relentless but sympathetic freak who avenges the murder of his love by taking on a grisly cannibal (a blank-faced, far-from-Frodo Elijah Wood). The film adapts this (later retitled The Hard Goodbye) and two of its follow-ups including The Big Fat Kill, seemingly blas&eacute; about the similarities among the plots and characters, convinced that the seductive imagery and picturesque citizens would grasp the attention.<br /><br />Be warned, though - this is not a movie for the faint of heart. The extreme violence does get a bit obtrusive, but you can say the same for Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO and others. But to point out its graphic nature is a moot point. It is classic cinema that should be seen and appreciated for what it is-pure entertainment.ts and characters, convinced that the seductive imagery and picturesque citizens would grasp the attention. <br />Be warned, though - this is not a movie for the faint of heart.

B0007OCG56|5.0|This is a journey to hope, in search of  a better future and new dreams. These two women will gather a very original family: he is a successful chef, his wife is an unpredictable, hyper kinetic and selfish woman. She has reached a social status, but nothing is enough for her. Her mother Cloris Lechman (who stole the show) is simply an assertive woman, who was in her golden years a jazz singer, she is somehow the embodiment of the maturity in the house and that's why she controls the natural order. She is suspicious, clever and very funny, trying to keep the fragile equilibrium in that home.<br /><br />The frontier is far beyond from being a simple set of dots and lines. The idiom's barrier works out as a very original device to arouse laughs, but also make us think about the far from envy situation.<br /><br />Sympathy's Paz Vega is overwhelming her fresh image and spontaneity makes so credible her role that allowed us to engage and make a sincere rapport with her and her circumstance.<br /><br />This very original script enriches itself due the bonhomie of this lovely child who will establish the natural link between all the members of the family and her mother, who lives according nonnegotiable rules; her honesty is bulletproof, so well her affections and wishes.<br /><br />I liked the smart final, there are not easy concessions, it proposes you a deep revision about your way of living, the value of those little details that establish the difference and allows to dictate the red alarm to save a boring marriage.<br /><br />This a very touching movie, plenty of  human warmth, a funny portrait that faces two clear different lifestyles without restrictions or preconceived stereotypes.<br /><br />Absolutely marvelous, one film that rejoins us with the savoir vivre.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|First off i dont care what people say about this band about how o the singer sucks and the lyrics are terrible....bulls*** <br />If you think about it system of a down is not trying to be like other bands or sound like anyone...there system of a down there one of a kind. Now when i hear people say o the singer sucks he really doesnt because every band sounds different and has different ways of singing and expressing the lyrics. unlike most bands today who just sing...this stuff is different..its wacky crazy and sometimes even funny to listen to. <br /> <br />Now about the album. <br />As you know SOAD has been very sucessful with there other albums such as Toxicity and there self-titled and now this one. <br />This album isnt much different from the others the only differences is that the album is shorter and the backup singer sings more but thats not a bad thing because this is the first part of there double cd and the backup singer singing more fits the songs on this cd i think if the lead singer just sang all of it then it wouldnt be right and im gettin tired of people saying Darron (backup singer) sings too much...bulls*** he does not ok imagine serj(lead) singing darrons parts...it wouldnt fit because serj and darron have different voices and tones when they sing so i think they did a great job with the vocals and letting darron sing a little more because he is a good singer and i didnt realize that he had a good voice until i heard this cd cause in the previous cds u just basically hear him as backup. <br /> <br />Songs on the cd <br /> <br />1 Soldier Side (Intro)  <br />2 B.Y.O.B 5/5 <br />3 Revenga 4/5 <br />4 Cigaro 5/5 <br />5 Radio/Video 4/5 <br />6 This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like Im On This Song 4/5 <br />7 Violent Pornography 5/5 <br />8 Question! 4/5 <br />9 Sad Statue 5/5 <br />10 Old School Hollywood 3/5 <br />11 Lost In Hollywood 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Overall this album is there latest and greatest and is worth buying and i would recommend listening to there older albums such as there Self Titled and Toxicity <br />
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends was basically the beginning of Radiohead's genius (Pablo Honey was pretty good though).  That being said, I enjoy it the most out of all Radiohead albums, which means a lot.  To me, there are absolutely no weak tracks, and the albums flows very well.  As opposed to OK Computer, there are times when the guys rock out, but there are still the quiet, impressive growers.  If you're looking for an introduction to Radiohead, this is not it (OK Computer is the best album for starting out).  However, this is a brilliant piece of music that should not be overlooked.  My favourites include: Nice Dream, My Iron Lung, Just, Bullet Proof, and Planet Telex. <br /> <br />Also recommended is the My Iron Lung EP, which holds 6 precious Bends-era b-sides.  It helps to bridge the huge musical gap between Pablo Honey and The Bends.
B00004Z400|5.0|The Deftones formed in the late 1980's, but didn't release their first real C.D. until 1995. This album, \\"Adrenaline,\\" was very heavy, raw, and energetic. In 1997, they released \\"Around the Fur,\\" another heavy album, and one that helped the Deftones step out of Korn's shadow. \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"Around the Fur\\" were two of the first ever nu-metal albums, and many modern nu-metal bands have cited the Deftones as an influence, but these albums' sales did not compare with the good reviews they got from critics.<br /><br />This C.D., the group's only to go platinum, is when the Deftones really came into their own, because with their third album, the Deftones seemed like they wanted to slay the horse they rode in on. It's about 10 times less heavy than \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"ATF,\\" and the hip-hop influence is all but eliminated. The Deftones despise the \\"nu-metal\\" label, and have tried hard to get rid of it. I believe \\"The White Pony\\" isn't rap/nu-metal; I'd call it more of an alternative or progressive or melodic metal album. Some of the Deftones' past seeps through into some of these songs (as you'll see below), but, for the most part, this sounds like a completely new band. The new sound alienated some old-school headbangers, but, since this is the Deftones' most accessible and easy-to-listen to album, it also attracted many new fans. I'm not sure if Chino and Co. would have made this album if their two predecessors, the heavier albums, were more popular, but \\"The White Pony\\" is very smooth, melodic, atmospheric, and often pretty.<br /><br />When writing this album, there was some commotion amongst the band members (particularly guitarist Steph Carpenter and singer Chino Moreno), but the result was an album that's probably the second best C.D. to be released since the year 2000 (second only to Tool's \\"Lateralus\\").<br /><br />1. \\"Back to School\\": One of the disc's three singles. \\"The White Pony\\" was originally released without this song, but the Deftones re-released it a few months later, and \\"Back to School\\" was included. Even though there is some proper singing, this song mostly consists of \\"Adrenaline\\"-esque riffs and rapping. It's the second heaviest song on here, but that makes it not a very good representation of the album as a whole. It's funny that \\"Around the Far\\" had a song about summer, and this album has a song about returning to school.<br />2. \\"Feiticeira\\": Even though it has a fairly fast opening riff and fast pace throughout, Chino's clean singing makes this song not very heavy. (That is often the case with this album, actually; the music is sort of hard, but Chino makes it keeps it melodic.) This song is lyrically interesting; it's about a kidnaping scenario.<br />3. \\"Mechanical Bath\\": This song, especially the beginning, is among the most pretty, soothing, and atmospheric that the Deftones have ever written. It has very spacey sounding guitars, but this song is mainly vocals and a slow drum beat. The choruses are still hard, and the song gains momentum and ends with some guitar riffs. Lyrically, this song is about a sexual fantasy Chino has, which involves a woman taking a bath; thus, a few seconds of this song sounds like water dripping from a faucet.<br />4. \\"Elite\\": The Deftones throw us a curve ball for track four, by writing their heaviest song ever. This song's relentless guitars and energy, and raging, robotic vocals should make for a great mosh pit. \\"Elite\\" is definitely a personal favorite, even if it is a little bit out of place.<br />5. \\"RX Queen\\": The verses of this song have some guitar strings that make a \\"ner ner\\" sound, but this is mainly a melodic and very spacey song. This song has more hard choruses, which create a good friction between the verses and the choruses. Pretty much just one drum beat runs throughout this song, and it ends with some whispering.<br />6. \\"Street Carp\\": Another example of a song which has a few riffs and is fairly fast paced, but it is ultimately only semi-heavy.<br />7. \\"Teenager\\": An absolutely breathtaking song with great singing. It was originally a song by Team Sleep (Chino's side project), but the Deftones adopted it. There are some light, repetitive guitar strings, and what sounds like a distant drum beat, but \\"Teenager\\" is mainly music made from turntables. If I could describe this song in one word it would be \\"b-e-a-utiful.\\"<br />8. \\"Knife Party\\": This song begins with light guitar strumming, but then the riffs become heavy, and briefly create a crunch. Chino sings \\"I could float here forever/we can't touch the floor;\\" lyrics which might refer to being high off of drugs. And those lyrics are very fitting because this song makes you feel like you're among the clouds.

You don't have to like the rest of the Deftones material to like this, because this is not only very mature, unique, and breathtaking, it is also one of the best C.D.'s of the new millennium. I recommend it to anybody who loves music.with great singing. It was originally a song by Team Sleep (Chino's side project), but the Deftones adopted it. There are some light, repetitive guitar strings, and what sounds like a distant drum beat, but \\"Teenager\\" is mainly music made from turntables. If I could describe this song in one word it would be \\"b-e-a-utiful.\\"   8. \\"Knife Party\\": This song begins with light guitar strumming, but then the riffs become heavy, and briefly create a crunch. Chino sings \\"I could float here forever/we can't touch the floor;\\" lyrics which might refer to being high off of drugs.

B0000TLA9G|4.0|Guns N' Roses is probably the best band that ever lived. However, I think the greatest hits should have better songs of them on it. I would most recommend \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" their first album. But don't get me wrong; this is a great cd. <br /> <br />Welcome to the Jungle- 5/5 Most original from GN'R. Great song! <br /> <br />Sweet Child O' mine- 5/5 Another one from appetite for destruction. I love the solo from Slash. <br /> <br />Patience- 5/5 A slower song of Guns, but I like it. Great Guitar! <br /> <br />Paradise City- 5/5 Everybody's favorite. Great song! <br /> <br />Knockin' on Heaven's Door- 4/5 Good song, but gets old quick. <br /> <br />Civil War- 5/5 Great song and has a good moral to it; that war is bad <br /> <br />You could be mine- 4/5 Good song, but could have been replaced with another hit from GN'R. <br /> <br />Don't Cry- 4.5/5 Good song, kinda slow but Axl's voice is really good in this song. <br /> <br />November Rain- 5/5 Great song with a good moral story to it. <br /> <br />Live and Let Die- 4/5 Good song but not originally from GN'R. <br /> <br />Yesterdays- 4/5 Good song but they made better. <br /> <br />Ain't it fun- 3.5/5 okay song, it shows a side of Guns that I don't care for that's kind of punk rock. <br /> <br />Since I don't have you- 3/5 okay, but I don't think they should have redone this song. <br /> <br />Sympathy for the Devil- 3/5 okay, but still don't think it should be on greatest hits album. <br /> <br />This is a good cd, but I wish songs like Nightrain and Mr. Brownstone were on it. I would still buy this cd if you want to get an overall summary of what Guns N' Roses is about. Hope this review was helpful to you.
B000088E6D|5.0|I grew up listening to Frank, Bobby, Dino, Tony and Sammy and all the great's.  Mike hits it with class and cool control.  To all of those Frank whiners remember Frank was great, good and pretty bad depending on the time.  Same can be said for all of them.  No he is not Sanatra, thank God!  This kid records these songs with courage, snap and a maturity that belies his years.  There has not been a CD I have enjoyed this much in years.  I checked on his concert coming up.  SOLD OUT!  That's all you have to know.  Mike is the real deal, plain and simple.  He has a great future.  And he seems like a nice guy to boot.  Lay it on me Mike!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's not like Firelfy needs another good review, but I've been watching my DVDs that I just got last week, and am compelled to add my recommendation to all those that have gone before. I never heard of this show till a friend lent me one of the four DVDs a few weeks back (summer '05), It's a very smart show; very creative, with believeable and sympathetic able characters set in a galaxy of humans who seem to speak either English or Chinese. A mix of humor and drama, sci fi and western themes, and is true to both. Too bad the nitwits at Fox pulled the plug.  <br />
B000002N2P|5.0|Sounds like a very solid album. It's pretty simple, sure, and a quick listen, but it's fun. A lot of fun. The songs are all good, from the opening of \\"Armitage Shanks\\" to the end of \\"Walking Contradiction.\\" For an album made in reaction to old fans who claimed that Green Day had already \\"sold out\\" (which they certainly have now), it's very good. The fact that it stays strictly to simple punk elements is a bit of a weak point, but it's strong nonetheless.    Highlights:  \\"Walking Contradiction\\"  \\"Panic Song\\"  \\"Geek Stink Breath\\"  \\"86\\"  \\"Brat\\"    And the album booklet (or poster or whatever) is cool.    Oh and now I see why Letterbomb from American Idiot was a good song, they got it from the song \\"86\\" on this album. They're very similar, and the chorus is almost identical.    I'm sorry, it's almost midnight as I write this review and I'm tired, so it's not very good.    No, for the reviewer 2 slots down, Green Day's first full-length LP was 39/smooth released in 1990 (and then was re-released in 1991 and 2004 with \\"1000 Hours\\" and \\"Slappy\\" as \\"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\"). Edit: I know what an LP is. EP's don't usually have 10 tracks.
0743455967|4.0|I would recommend this more for King fans than for aspiring writers, but nonetheless I enjoyed it. This book was a revelation into Stephen King's personality and proves that he is much more than a mere master of horror. He takes his craft seriously as does he things like family, nature and baseball. Read this and you'll look at his other fiction in a whole new light!
B000007491|5.0|Reminds me alot of the band Rare Bird. Complex and varied arrangements. Well worth the price. If you like the sound of early YES, Camel, Armageddon or FLASH, this CD is for you. I find the songs to be far more intricate and interesting than later Supertramp releases.
B0006L16N8|5.0|as always, great CD, chris martin has an amazing voice, and the music talent is phenomenal...
1573229725|3.0|&#65279;During a trip, I was in my favorite bookstore, Books and Company in Dayton, Ohio browsing the fiction shelves from Z backwards rather from A forwards when I came across \\"Fingersmith.\\"  The blurbs on the covers mentioned some good comments/awards by recognizable reviewers and I like to read good historical era fiction to supplement my readings in non-fiction history; so, I bought it on impulse as I did not have access to the net to check for more lengthy reviews.  Thus my introduction to \\"lesbian soft \\" literature; otherwise, I might not have read it which would have been a shame because it is a good read and is not focused on or excessively graphical about female-female sex.  After I finished it, I said to yself, \\"Self\\" wasn't it strange that no man had sex with a female (or any sex at all) and the males were either eunuchs or villains or both?<br /><br />The story is, however, well constructed and ultimately compels one to read it through with as few stops as possible - for me the compulsion was the solution of the mysteries presented in the middle part of the novel.  It is set in the time of Charles Dickens - a play based on his novel \\"Oliver Twist\\" is discussed on the first page of this novel.  His novels were hot items for turning into live theater during his life time.<br /><br />The two young female protagonists are of quite different backgrounds and the writer switches between the two in moving through the telling of the tale.  The first is Susan Trinder who was adopted as an infant by a common law \\"couple\\" Mrs Sucksby and Mr Ibbs, who have separate bedrooms even in a very crowded household in the slums of London.  Between them, the couple run criminal enterprises of several sorts, including Mrs Sucksby's baby-selling business. She takes in unwanted or stolen babies and finds buyers for them.  Susan, however, she has retained, ostensibly due to a promise to Susan's mother who was hanged on the gallows.  The couple have trained her in various criminalarts.<br /><br />Then comes in a gentry-turned-to-trash by the name of Richard Rivers whom the family calls \\"Gentleman.\\"  He has a scheme to swindle a young woman of Susan's age who will become rich if she marries but not if she remains single or dies.  This woman is named Maud Lilly, living with her uncle, Christopher Lilly.  Gentleman tells Susan of plans to marry Maud and then force her into an insane asylum so that he can control her whole fortune; he says he wants Susan to help in guiding Lilly into the marriage.  It seems that Miss Lilly's maid has resigned and she is to be convinced to take Susan as a replacement.  Rather improbable that Susan's slum-trained tongue could be retrained in a few weeks but apparently the author is also a fan of GBS's \\"Pygmalion.\\"  There are a number of improbabilities in the novel but they probably won't spoil the story to the point where<br /><br />you might be tempted to stop reading.<br /><br />Now to Miss Lilly.  For some reason which is never explained, her uncle has had the nurses in an insane asylum raise her until she was ten years old.  They live in a gruesome old mansion in a rural area beyond the outskirts of London.  He retrieves her from her caretakers and then begins to train her in reading, diction and deportment so as to take a place in his compulsive hobby and business - the erotic literature known at the time.  We are treated to this picture of a girl in her tender teen-age years helping to care for his beloved collection and reading choice bits to a collection of fans and booksellers who dote on such stuff.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that Susan is indeed accepted by Miss Lilly as her maid and the marriage takes place.  It is at this time that the real mysteries begin to arise and we find that things are not what they seem to be.  From here on the compulsion to read to the end begins.  If you are a reader of murder mysteries and Gothic tales, you may solve the mystery before the end but I was left with many questions and had a number of surprises right up to the end.<br /><br />In summary, not great literature but a good read; kind of a soap opera set in Dickensian times.
0141439807|5.0|Out of all Jane Austen's wonderful novels \\"Mansfield Park\\" is perhaps her most widely-debated. With a heroine who triumphs through her utter passivity, uncomfortable themes of familial power and corruption, and sub-text on slavery, it is rightfully described as \\"Austen's most complex and profound *and* her least likeable novel.\\" As well as this is Austen's own declaration that \\"Mansfield Park\\" was her favourite work. To say it is unique is an understatement.<br /><br />Fanny Price is only a child when she is sent from her impoverished home to live with her aunt at the grand Mansfield Park. A quiet child, Fanny is overwhelmed by her wealthy and privileged family and is painfully homesick - a condition that the Bertrams cannot possibly understand. Hasn't she been removed from a life of near-squalor and no prospects? But the noble-yet-cold Sir Thomas Bertram, his child-like wife Lady Bertram, his self-centred eldest son Tom and his daughters Maria and Julia are not cruel to Fanny in the way that the evil step-family was cruel to Cinderella - simply misguided and so removed from her situation as to not understand the first thing about her. But from her second aunt, the loathsome Mrs Norris, Fanny receives only criticism and thinly-veiled scorn. Only the youngest son Edmund, with ambitions to become a quiet country clergyman, shows genuine compassion and sympathy to her, and soon the cousins are as close as siblings.<br /><br />Fanny grows into a young woman, but keeps her timidity - which hides a bright mind and a clear sense of right and wrong. From London come the glamorous Crawford siblings - the rakish Henry Crawford who shamelessly flirts with Maria, even though she is engaged to one Mr Rushmore, and the witty Mary Crawford, who soon captivates Edmund. This is much to Fanny's heartbreak since she has been secretly in love with Edmund for years, and she cannot help but distrust the dazzling Crawfords.<br /><br />It is not an understatement to say disaster strikes when Mr Crawford proposes to Fanny, as for her the attentions of such a man are utterly unwelcome. Unwelcome suitors are standard fare in Austen's previous novels, such as Mr Collins to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Elton to Emma Woodhouse, but here the situation takes on a darker tone. Firstly, because Austen's previous uses of this plot-turn are usually played for laughs with the suitor as a comical buffoon, and second because her heroines are well able enough to reject such men. For Fanny however, the experience terrifies her and one can feel her distress and conflict as her family pressure her into marriage against the utter conviction of her heart. Like a bird in a cage, Fanny is completely helpless.<br /><br />Austen is renowned for poking fun at contemporary issues with her ingenious wit, and \\"Mansfield Park\\" is concerned with the disillusions of the upper-class: the belief that superior educations, convenient marriages, good manners and breeding and sparkling wit automatically make a morally good person. As such, whilst the Bertram family live their lives with the complete assumption that they are decent people, Fanny's modesty and self-discipline ensures that her character is superior to each and every one of them. The saying \\"the moment you believe you are a worthy person is the moment you cease to be one\\" caters nicely to Austen's ideal, and her general themes of conservatism, modesty and quiet reflection.<br /><br />All of Austen's heroines are diverse in a central, particular way. For instance, Emma of \\"Emma\\" is the only one removed from the pressure of making a financially secure marriage, whilst Anne of \\"Persuasion\\" is the only one who is at a more mature age than the others. In this way, all of Austen's novels have a unique individual young woman as its protagonist. And so what is Fanny Price's particular trait? You may think that it is her timidity, but more surprising is the fact that Fanny is completely infallible. Throughout the course of the story Fanny's judgement never falters, nor is she ever once proved incorrect. She is a positive angel, and as Edmund says at one point: \\"We have all been more or less to blame... every one of us, excepting Fanny.\\"<br /><br />As well as this, Austen turns her eye onto the topic of family and home-life, in a particularly bittersweet way. Fanny continually suffers from displacement - first at Mansfield Park, and later in the novel when she returns to her family home in Portsmouth to find it is not the idealistic family home she half-remembers. It is a poignant, but too-often true sensation that many contemporary readers may relate to: the return to your childhood home only to find that it isn't really \\"home\\" anymore.<br /><br />In this Penguin Classics edition, Kathyrn Sutherland and Tony Tanner provide excellent Introductions/Appendixes to the work. Even if you usually skip over these sorts of things, I highly recommend taking the time to read them, as Tanner in particular sheds new light over several episodes in the novel: for example the metaphorical connotations in the family's walk through Rushmore's gardens, and the foreshadowing prevalent in what appears to be a simple game of cards.<br /><br />Despite its controversy, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is perhaps my favourite Austen novel (I still haven't read \\"Northanger Abbey\\", so I can't truthfully make that claim yet) and though Fanny is not as spunky or spirited as many readers would like or are used to, it is actually quite refreshing to have a shy and introverted protagonist who wins the game of life; who advocates the real importance of morals and goodness. You don't need to be a strong feminine role-model to be a good person.y's judgement never falters, nor is she ever once proved incorrect.

B000002BSG|5.0|I'm not going to write an in-depth review or anything. All I want to say is that if you haven't yet, you have to get your hands on this album any way you can.  <br /> <br />This is the perfect album for chilling, driving, getting it on, whatever. The vocals, the music, the beats are all amazing. Definitely the best Jamiroquai album. <br /> <br />Just get it already you lazy bum.
B000002JOH|4.0|dont get me wrong here. this is a very good cd. but is it a classic thrash cd? thats what i wonder. it does include some great songs like walk, this love, a new level, and by demons be driven. but this doesnt strike me as 1 of the greatest thrash cds.  <br /> <br />i think the main reason i dont like it is because all they do is scream. it takes no talent to scream. as a matter of fact the only song they sing 1 note in is this love. it is still a good cd though but if you want pantera at their best get cowboys from hell. if you like the screaming there is some but they do actually sing in that 1.  <br /> <br />if your looking for a classic thrash cd try metallicas master of puppets or megadeths rust in peace.
0143034901|5.0|This is a great book, regardless of whose work it reminds you.  It's a full-fledged mystery, several intricate love stories, and a series of tradgedies that in the end leave you feeling good about life and literature.  Zafon does a fantastic job of illustrating the idea of history repeating itself.  His Barcelona of the 1940's and 50's seems magical and mystical, a certain specific quality you only seem to get from writers without a native English tongue.
B000002H33|5.0|As it has been pointed out by countless other reviews, this is a metal mildstone, and a mildstone in general for albums. What I think seperates it from the others is everything was at the top of it's game. Playing, production, song writing, never on any of there other albums was it at the level it is on this one. <br />   Before they became the sellouts there known to be, they had 8 or more minute songs like master of puppets, orion, and disposible heroes. They were not aiming to be mainstream, but rather be musical and creative. <br />   Alas, this would be the last album Cliff Burton, the bassist, would be on before he was killed in a bus wreck. <br />   Other classic metal songs like Leper Messiah, Battery, and Damage Inc are on here. More than any other album this album made thrash go into the mainstream of other metal bands, making it a respectable genre. <br />    The lyric content is incredible, of darkness and insanity and other hot topics, James delivers what was inspired by Black Sabbath. It makes St Anger's lyrics seem like from a 6th grader. <br />
B0009MWEMG|5.0|This technology is progressively improving.  I bought this title before the long flight back to Japan from the U.S. and it lost none of its potency from the awesome original.<br /><br />Highly recommeded.  Hostage is a great UMD title also.
0385510454|3.0|John Grisham's readers have come to expect fast-paced action, a riveting plot and decent characters in his works.  Unfortunately, in The Broker, he fails on all three counts.  Grisham's last six books or so have been hot and cold, and The Broker can best be described as tepid.<br /><br />Former powerbroker and hotshot DC attorney, Joel Backman, is serving a 20 year jail sentence for selling military secrets.  He found himself in possession of a sophisticated satellite software program, and tried to sell it to various countries.  As an inept and unpopular president gets ready to leave office, corrupt CIA director, Teddy Maynard, bribes the president to pardon Joel Backman (only 6 years into his jail term).  He plans to plop Backman down into a foreign country under CIA watch, and then leak his whereabouts to those countries wishing Backman dead.<br /><br />It is here that The Broker becomes the Italian travelogue and coffee diary.  Backman is relocated to Bologna.  With the help of a private tutor, he starts learning the language. He learns nouns...he learns adjectives...he learns adverbs...he learns verbs...he learns verb tenses, etc.  You get the picture.  Then he goes out for sumptuous meals, which are described in great detail (all at government expense, of course).  Then he starts seeing the sites.  He tours churches, cathedrals, towers, etc. and we get the history and description of each.  And finally, he stops for a cup of coffee, cappuccino or espresso at least 5-6 times a day.  Without all this \\"stuffing,\\" the book could have been 50% shorter.<br /><br />The climax to The Broker is very unsatisfying and the ending rather weak.  Grisham leaves things a bit open-ended and we can only hope that it's not because we'll be seeing these characters again.  There weren't many that were very likable.  Hopefully Grisham will let them rest in peace.<br /><br />So read The Broker if you're a Grisham fan, but don't expect one of his better works.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|First off i'd like to say this movie was great and i got plenty of laughs out of it. For those of you who said this movie was hard to understand because of the accents, how stupid are you? If you cant understand people in this movie then you must have a pretty hard time in america. Besides thats just another excuse people wanna use to put this movie down. Also if you didnt like 28 Days Later what would make you think you would like this?? It'll be interesting to read some more reviews and see if anyone has a GOOD reason to dislike this movie such as you just didnt think it was funny. Simple enough

B000001FKY|5.0|I'm 29 years old and I grew up with Def Leppard in the 80's.  I always thought they were a top-notch metal band.  Their songs were, and still are, catchy and, indeed, never sound dated.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to catch Def Lep in concert in the late-80's and even luckier to get an almost front row view of them at the Live 8 sound-check here in Philly a few weeks back and they sound better than ever.  They performed \\"Rock of Ages,\\" covered \\"No Matter What\\" (Badfinger staple) and \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me.\\"  After hearing that and the actual performance the next day (thank goodness I chose to see it in person as MTV and sister station VH1 chose to neglect Def Lep in their \\"wonderful\\" coverage of Live 8), a wave of nostalgia hit me and I went home and jammed to Hysteria for the entire holiday weekend.<br /><br />I find that I like and appreciate it more than ever.  I remember MTV's heavy airplay of the video for \\"Love Bites\\" in 1988 and even as a 12 year-old (at that age hardly anyone wants to hear and/or see anything more than once), I never tired of it.  To this day, I can watch that video or just listen to the song time and again and enjoy it just as much as the last time.

B00007ELEL|5.0|The Big Lebowski is quite an odd journey into the mind of a character called \\"the Dude\\", a kidnapping, pot, his crazy best friend, the Coen Brothers and Bowling.  I watch movies frequently and I have yet to see more then a few that are as odd as this film.  Basically the plot is that there are two Lebowski's, the Rich, Old, Millionaire and the Dude who is a Grateful Dead kind of person who doesn't work, writes a check for a carton of milk and likes to go bowling with his two friends.  There is a case of mistaken identity and the Dude is visited by some thugs who want the other Lebowski's money.  Shortly afterwards, the Kidnapping begins and we are led on one crazy adventure that is truly rewarding with laughs and artistic originality.  Also, knowing that this was released around the time of the Gulf War is helpful because then you are able to get one of the jokes in one of The Dude's many \\"trips\\".  Well, I could say more, but I would end up repeating what other reviewers have already said.  If you like weird movies, the Coen Brothers, comedy or anything in-between, then by all means see this movie as quickly as possible, it's worth it.  I may have lost my original copy, but I plan to get a new one on my next trip to the store, it's just that good.
B0007GADZO|5.0|When I first got this, I didn't really know what to think because I was so overwhelmed with sounds I didn't know what to do.  It blasts off with this crazy guitar riff on \\"Building the Church\\" and then you have the slow drone of \\"Dying for Your Love\\" which has a nice pedal bass throughout.  Then there is \\"Glorious\\" which picks the tempo back up and is rather flashy.  \\"K'm-pee-du-wee\\" is a really cool ballad in which Steve's guitar seems to actually say \\"K'm pee du wee\\".  \\"Firewall\\" is where Steve really shows of his vocals.  He's got a good voice.  It doesn't cover up the flashy guitar stuff either and the horns are awesome.  \\"Freak Show Excess\\" is the most blazing guitar stuff on here with crazy sweeps and everything.  \\"Lotus Feet\\" (track 7 of course) is the most beautiful piece I've heard in a long time, maybe ever.  The orchestra behind him is great and the sustain is unreal.  \\"Yai-Yai\\" is a song I used to hate.  It made me want to almost throw up because of the tone but now I'll pop in the cd just to listen to it.  The melody is so catching and I start to \\"Yai\\" along with it. \\"Midway Creatures\\" is a cool little piece that picks the tempo of the album back up and then there's \\"I'm Your Secrets\\" which is a great phrase in it's self and is really cool.  The last track, \\"Under It All\\" is the best ending I can think of.  It is sooo good and is possiably my favorite song on here.  The whole idea of a multilayered concept album is genious.  I spend a long time reading the little pieces of the story and putting things together.  This is one of my favorite albums ever.  I recommend it for the listener who is listening to be more than entertained.

B0007OASII|5.0|I've always loved Kamelot's sound, but now they've made an awesome CD minus the Middle Ages backdrop. Well, at least most of it. <br /> <br />Most of the songs on this CD are great, but there's still fillers in between some of them. I wish Kamelot would drop the 15-30 second sound bits. Anyway, there's so many different elements that appeal to different types of rock music fans. <br /> <br />There are plenty of well done solos to appeal to the power metal fans. There's a certain degree of catchiness to alot of the songs (ex. The Haunting, Moonlight) to appeal to radio rock worshippers. There's grim overtones coupled with some gravel-throated growls (March of Mephisto) to appeal to the death metal fans. And there's a wonderful vocal talent coupled with great drumming and precise guitar work for all progressive metal fans. <br /> <br />It's all of this and more. Kamelot is very underrated. Please tell someone about them so that they can get the praise and attention they deserve.
1400095913|4.0|This is a terrific first novel.  There were patchy parts that could use a bit of smoothing.  The plot got a bit bumpy.  However, the plot is an ingenious twist on the old serial killer theme. <br /> <br />Dexter, the main character, is a police employee who also happens to be a serial killer.  However, he does it for good and to fight the forces of evil....or does he?  A serial killer is knocking off prostitutes in a surgically perfect manner. Dexter has an innate ability to find serial killers, which his cop sister hopes to use to her advantage.  He admires the work of his counterpart and assists his sisters and her superiors. <br /> <br />The view from the serial killer's eyes is terrific.  The initial plot twists just looks too predictable to be true.  Thankfully, it is too predictable to be true and the turn and the twist that occurs works well. <br /> <br />This is a goos mystery and, if like me, you have tired of the serial killer routine, this is a very welcome break. <br /> <br />A fun read.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Updated: January 7, 2006<br /><br />I have now owned the product for six months.  I have nothing to change in my review.  I am surprised that people are having so many problems with this product.  My unit still works fine; the battery holds a charge; the pole has not broken; the handle has not broken.  Maybe my unit is not typical.  However, you do need to have realistic expectations for this product.  The Swivel Sweeper is not a new revolutionary cleaning apparatus worthy of a patent (as the info commercial implies).  It is just an electric sweeper for quick clean ups.  If you want the thorough results that a vacuum provides--use a vacuum.<br /><br />Original Review<br />I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for two weeks.  If you are looking for something better than your dust pan, this is the product for you.  If you are looking for something to replace your vacuum cleaner, you are going to be disappointed.  The pros: light weight, high quality, cordless, rechargeable, easy to use, maneuverable.  The cons: overpriced, can't ever replace a vacuum, time-consuming periodic cleaning.  The product is just what I was looking for: a cordless, rechargeable, electric dust pan that I could keep in the kitchen next to the refrigerator and pull out twice a week and sweep the kitchen floor.  I have a light colored tile floor and it shows every little particle of dirt.  In addition, my cat spreads Friskies on the floor and the sweeper picks up those nicely.  The Swivel Sweep is a fairly high quality product.  All the parts look well designed, fairly durable (they are just plastic), and fit together well.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweep is oversold on the info commercial (as to be expected).  It will never take the place of a vacuum cleaner.  It is not a vacuum cleaner.  It creates no suction.  It is simply a sweeper.  I would summarize it as an electric dust pan.  The product has four rotating brushes that sweep items into a small centralized dust pan with openings on all four sides.  The Swivel Sweeper is much quieter than a traditional vacuum cleaner; however, one would not use it in a room with a sleeping baby as advertised--it is not that quiet.  It makes a tone with medium-high pitched whine.  The picture on the box shows the product being used to sweep dirt from a carpet after a house plant has been toppled--forget it!  That is not a good use of this product.  Use a real vacuum cleaner for that job.  This product is really only effective on hard surfaces.  A dust pan is not what I would use on a carpet.  Yes, you could pick up small items sitting on the surface of a carpet like paper clips, but realistically, to clean a carpet adequately, one should use a vacuum cleaner with strong suction and a powerful beater brush to separate the carpet strands.  The Swivel Sweeper has neither of these.  The Swivel Sweep is not comparable to a real vacuum cleaner.  The Swivel Sweeper has problems picking up some very small items even on hard surfaces.  Sometimes an item will shoot across the floor instead of going into the dust pan.  I find myself going over the same area multiple times to pick up some items (but no big deal).<br /><br />Because the product is fairly new, it is a bit overpriced.  I think $29 would be more appropriate.  I would expect to see it at Target in a year or two for $19.95.  Emptying the dust pan is easy.  Cleaning the sweeper is not.  The Swivel Sweeper comes with a \\"cleaning tool\\" which is nothing more than a thread cutter/seam ripper (if you know what that is).  Hair (human hair) gets wound around all four brushes and needs to be periodically cut and vacuumed out.  The manual says \\"on occasion\\" this cleaning need to be done.  The manual indicates the battery will last 45 minutes on one charge.  That seems reasonable since I am still on the original charge and have used the sweeper about 10 times.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product.ch quieter than a traditional vacuum cleaner; however, one would not use it in a room with a sleeping baby as advertised--it is not that quiet.

B0000027RL|4.0|Ten might not have been as good as its successor, Versus, and not been as experimental and original as 1994's Vitalogy, but one thing that Ten offered more than any of Pearl Jam's other efforts is the ability to completely and totally rock out to it. If you want to get energized, 8 out of the 11 tracks are hard rock pieces of material, the other three (\\"Black\\", \\"Release\\", \\"Oceans\\") are milder but, excluding \\"Oceans\\", are probably better than most of the rockers. <br /> <br />Personal tragedies such as \\"Alive\\" and \\"Black\\" coincide with sociological commentary like \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Why Go\\". Ten isn't all that musically diverse, but it makes up for that in lyrical variety. The only weak spot on the album is \\"Oceans\\", and that only takes two and a half minutes out of the rest of this excellent piece of alternative music.  <br /> <br />The two best tracks on Pearl Jam's debut are \\"Black\\" and \\"Release\\". The former being a harrowing ballad about suffering and relationships, and the latter being a gradually-building tension-fest of emotions sung excellently by a very deep-voiced Eddie Vedder. <br /> <br />I couldn't quite give Ten a five out of five just because Oceans really isn't very good at all, and there are a few spots in certain songs that just don't amount to what they could have been, but overall Pearl Jam delivered an excellent 90s rock symphony.
B0009IW88A|5.0|When I first heard that both Zimmer and Howard were composin the score for Batman Begins, I couldn't wrap my head around the idea and drove my wife nuts with my constant questioning, \\"How?\\" <br />But when I got my copy I was astounded. <br /> <br />This was not one of Danny Elfman's interchangable scores. This was Zimmer. This was Howard. Together And, yet neither. Something all together new. Granted Zimmer borrowed some from \\"King Arthur\\" and possibly \\"Gladiator\\" and Howard took a bit from \\"Unbreakable\\". But, the end product was a new moody sound appropriate for the new moody Batman, understated without a monotonous charge everytime the Batmobile appears or Batman zips up his outfit. <br /> <br />I highly recommend to lovers of film scores. Just remember, this isn't your Danny Elfman's Batman.

B000002H97|3.0|I don't agree with most Metallica fans or rock music critics on this one. Most of the critics hail The Black Album as being a metal masterpiece, and the hardcore fans all dislike it for being too mainstream. I disagree with both. Metallica's self-titled fifth album, called by many (including me) The Black Album, is neither a masterwork nor a complete piece of trash. It falls somewhere in between the two. <br /> <br />The lyrics in many cases is more impressive than Black's predocessors, but it's the songs themselves that aren't as good as Metallica's earlier efforts. I don't love the songwriting on Ride the Lightning's \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\", in many cases it isn't that good. But, I love the song structure and therefore it is a better song than say \\"Through the Never\\", which has excellent lyrical structure but the song itself is rather bland and boring. <br /> <br />The Black Album's best songs are the ones where James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Lars Ulrich, and Jason Newstead dare to stretch their musical capabilities and confirm originality still runs deep within their metalhead veins. \\"The Unforgiven\\", \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", and \\"Enter Sandman\\" all bend old Metallica traditions to become the best songs on the album, especially the first two I mentioned. \\"The Unforgiven\\" is part ballad, part western epic, and part heavy metal rocker, while \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is their first full-fledged melodic ballad (\\"Fade to Black\\" was pretty damn close to being a full-on ballad though), and what's more, it's a love song! <br /> <br />Metallica's fifth certainly has its moments of greatness, but it's just not a masterpiece. Songs like \\"Holier than Thou\\", \\"Through the Never\\", \\"The Struggle Within\\", and \\"The God that Failed\\" all bring the album down like a ship with a hole in it. And yet, it shines it places also, and so The Black Album doesn't quite sink.

B000957O82|3.0|This movie was great and had some great messages to send BUT the ending was horrible.  It was nice to see Albert and Allegra get back together, but the ending with Hitch going to her apartment was cheesy and bland.  It was rid with cheesy metaphors and bland, non-creative dialogue.  Its an allright movie to add to your romantic comedy collection.
B00000GAIW|4.0|When I say \\"organic\\" I don't mean heavy use of the keyboard instrument. What I mean is that actual instruments were used and are very obvious. Sometime in the mid to late 70's bands began extensive use of synthesisers, drum machines, and studio trickery. <br />Even Jethro Tull did this. A couple of their albums were heavily criticized for this use of \\"non organic\\" instrumentation.  <br />But not Aqualung. Aqualung is actually very heavy on acoustic guitar, piano, and real drums. In that sense, Aqualung is a very REAL album.It was actually more down to earth than Benefit. Aqualung isn't a perfect album, but it's very simply, a great piece of work. I appreciate the fact that Ian Anderson didn't direct his venom to God, but to those who \\"use His name in death\\". In the liner notes to the recent Jethro Tull Christmas Album, Anderson states that he isn't exactly a \\"paid up Christian\\" and I can also appreciate his sentiments. You don't have to be a \\"paid up Christian, or Jew, or Muslum, or (drop in a religion) to believe in and marvel at God.  <br />Listen to Aqualung, and forget the fact that it's 34 years old. It still speaks volumes about God and organized religion to anyone willing to listen. And in 1971, a lot of people bought this album and did listen. It's organic (real), and it's very, very good.
0765348780|5.0|\\"Gardens of the Moon\\" is the first book in a proposed ten volume series titled \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\".  To call this an epic fantasy would not do justice to the potential scope of this book and series.  Steven Erikson has most often been compared to George R.R. Martin (\\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\") and for good reason.  Erikson is writing a long running series set in a medieval styled realm with a good deal of political talk mixed heavily with battle.  The tone of the book is very dark and gritty, despite characters displaying good humor.  This first volume is a bit daunting to begin because Erikson dumps the reader into the intrigue of his world with very little warning or exposition.  What we know from the start is that there is a woman seeking to overthrow the Emperor of the Malazan Empire, many underhanded dealings regarding the missions given the mage soldiers, a young boy named Ganoes Paran who wants to be a soldier, and a hardened veteran who is angering this woman who is already claiming to be Empress.  But this is just the exposition given in a short prologue.  The meat of the novel begins several years later.<br /><br />Several years later Paran is a captain in the Malazan Army.  He is assigned to lead the legendary Bridgeburners.  The Bridgeburners are being sent on every nasty mission the Empress Laseen can come up with, mostly in the hopes of the Bridgeburners being destroyed by attrition.  Her problem with the Bridgeburners is that they are a reminder of the deposed Emperor and of the old battlefield glories of Malazan.  They are a beacon to any who may consider revolt against the Empress.  But Laseen's reach and ambition is far beyond getting rid of the Bridgeburners.  She has turned her eyes to the city of Darujhistan.  Darujhistan is one of the largest cities in the world, but while Laseen has turned her eyes to that city Malazan also faces a threat from a non-human race called the Tiste Andii and their magic.  There is also another sub-plot regarding a young girl who has her soul taken and been turned into a ruthless killer, and another storyline featuring several different characters in Darujhistan.<br /><br />Confused yet?  This is only the tip of the iceberg, but to go into greater detail may spoil some of the surprises found in \\"Gardens of the Moon\\". It is also a book that is very difficult to adequately describe in a relatively short space.  The viewpoint that Erikson gives the reader is that of the common soldiers and mages and peasants.  We seldom get to see things through the eyes of those who hold real power.  Laseen is never given a viewpoint, nor are the nobles or many commanding officers of any real rank.  But this is where the sense of discovery comes in.  As far as I can tell, Steven Erikson has built up a very rich world but he only gives us bits and pieces of what is really going on.  With each character and with each chapter we get a little bit more of the overall story and more often than not what we think is going on is only a small piece of the whole, and since this is Book One, what we learn by the end is still only a small piece of an even greater whole.<br /><br />While some time is spent trying to figure out who these characters are and how they relate to each other and the world, this is fascinating fantasy novel and one of the best opening novels to a series in some time.  It compares well to \\"A Game of Thrones\\" except that it is a bit more confusing from the start.  I understand that this series starts to come together a bit more in the next two books, and that may be a high price to pay for some readers who want to fully understand what is going on early, but I feel that the time invested in reading this book (and ultimately the series) is going to be worth it.  Because the US publishing of this series is behind that of the UK, we are only just getting Book 4 where the UK is already on 6 and waiting for 7 (maybe 8), which means that we can expect to see each subsequent volumein a reasonable amount of time (unlike George Martin).<br /><br />The bottom line for this book is that it is well worth the time spent reading it and it marks the beginning of what may be one of the best fantasy series ever written.  I have read elsewhere that each subsequent book is better than the one before it.  If that is the case, and this book is already quite good, it bodes well for the future of this series.  While a 10 Book series may seem daunting, know that Erikson is almost done and he has a specific plan on how to finish it and seems to be churning out high quality books at a fairly good clip.  If you like the fantasy of George Martin then this is certainly one to check out.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryquent volume in a reasonable amount of time (unlike George Martin).   <br /> <br />The bottom line for this book is that it is well worth the time spent reading it and it marks the beginning of what may be one of the best fantasy series ever written.

B000002KLG|5.0|George Benson's \\"Give Me The Night\\" album, released in July of 1980, was produced by Quincy Jones, & the result is a masterpiece. It really makes you wonder why it's the only album that Quincy ever produced for George, because the two were clearly a great pairing, & Quincy's liner notes indicate he was a huge Benson fan & was truly delighted to work with him. Plus, the album was a strong commercial success as well--it peaked at #3 on the Billboard album chart & went platinum in less than 4 months after its release. Earlier in his musical career, Benson had been an instrumental performer who rarely sang on record--considering what a massively accomplished guitar player he was, it's understandable. On the other hand, he was an incredible vocalist, which he again proved with this album, so you certainly can't argue with the decision for him to do more singing on his albums. If you want to hear some truly great R&B/ soul music, you simply cannot go wrong with this album. Quincy did a heck of job producing this--with its heavy use of strings, backing vocals, & the reverb-heavy sound, the album has a seductive 'late night' atmosphere that works wonders time and time again. Five of the 10 tracks, including the hits \\"Love X Love\\" & the title track, were written by Rod Temperton who was formerly a member of Heatwave, & also wrote songs performed by Michael Jackson in this era including the hits \\"Rock With You\\" and \\"Off the Wall\\" (which were also produced by Quincy Jones). I've seen Temperton referred to as a `hack', but you know what, the guy sure could write great tunes. The album opening \\"Love X Love\\" is a catchy, arresting ballad-ish song, but it's taken at a brisk tempo as if to give it some disco dance floor appeal, & it interestingly matches the feel good romance lyrics with contemplative music. There are a couple of irresistible instrumental-plus-scat vocal tracks with \\"Dinorah, Dinorah\\" and Temperton's funky \\"Off Broadway\\" which, with its great synth bass riff & guitar licks, is simply packed with hooks. Likewise, the title track is an infectiously catchy hook-fest. There are a couple of catchy-yet-haunting gems with \\"What's On Your Mind\\" and the supremely moody, addictive \\"Midnight Love Affair\\" (with an infectious, ominous bass line). Temperton provided the super mellow romantic ballad that closes the album, \\"Turn Out the Lamplight\\", which is supremely dreamy; & there's also his \\"Star Of A Story (X)\\" (a Heatwave cover) which is great as well--it has an undeniably catchy chorus. A couple ballads do mar the album a little--\\"Love Dance\\" (with acoustic guitar from Lee Ritenour) is dull & tiring, & the very jazzy \\"Moody's Mood\\" is decent but has grating vocals from Patti Austin, & Benson's super fast reciting is also annoying--but, these 2 tracks are both under 3 &  minutes each, & they are far outweighed by all of the excellence that the album offers. There are naturally bound to be jazz purists who will accuse this album of being a `sell-out', but seriously, with consistently excellent material, performances, & production, this is a must have album for any serious listener.
1402555989|5.0|I think that what determines if a person likes a thing or not is if they see a reflection of themselves in it.  Thoughtful or autistic people would probably enjoy this book very much, because they can identify with Christopher and learn something about their own life from the things that happen in his.   <br /> <br />But people who have difficulty or impatience understanding autism might not enjoy this book very much.  Probably would keep being frustrated. <br /> <br />This is a very good and rich story that I'm grateful for having read.  I even bought the audiobook to listen to on trips - it's also wonderfully done.  Pick yourself up a copy and enjoy.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm horrified I never watched this series when it was on television. In my defense it was on a bad night and I never got off work in time to see it. A friend told me it was awesome and I should set my VCR to record it but it was cancelled that week.     A few months ago a friend showed me a preview of \\"Serenity\\", a feature length movie that will be released later this year based on the TV show with all the original cast back, that he had downloaded and he then loaned me his DVD set so I wouldn't be lost when we went to see the movie.    Wow. I was blown away. The precept was awesome, the characters were brilliant, the special effects innovative and beautiful, and the cast was brilliant (they worked extremely well together and had unreal chemistry).     The story is about an ex-rebel and his friend from the war who own and operate a spaceship called Serenity. The rest of the crew is a varied set of drifters, refugees, and searchers. The show has a feel that is a combination old west and Sci-Fi. It sounds strange but it works beautifully.    There are three episodes included in the set that were never aired and the commentaries and other bonus material is great. After watching my friend's copy I ran out the next day and bought my own copy, mostly because I loved the show but also to show my support in the form of money to the new movie and the possibility of reviving the series.    There is hope. The DVD sales have been massive and massive DVD sales caused the pinheads at Fox to realize what they had had with \\"Family Guy\\", maybe the same thing will happen here. Also, we have a feature film to look forward to and if it does well this might be a further push for fox to resurrect the series.
B0000541AM|5.0|This movie is a surreal urban nightmare; a great film to sweep you up and carry you along with the action. Also, the early performances of some very familar actors. A total Kick! And, the great tagline; \\"Warriors, come out to pla-a-y!\\"
B00006RCNW|5.0|This is in my opinion the best show on television right now. I started watching this show when FX did a reshowing in preparatin for season two and have been hopelessly addicted since. Rawer and gittier than \\"The Sopranos\\" better acting and more realistic than \\"Law & Order\\" (since Orbach and Noth left at least). This show has everything.  <br /> <br />The show takes place in LA in an experimental satellite station in the crime infested Farmington district. The show revolves around Vic Mackie, played by Michael Chikliss, the leader of a strike team that continuously crosses the line into crime. I had people tell mr they couldn't imagine Chikliss as anything but the Commish. This show will blow that image clean out of your mind. Along with the main storyline around the strike team are several periphreal story lines about other cops in the station. Rather than detract from the story they enrich it and add an additional level of reality. <br /> <br />The extra features on this are great. If you thought the show crossed the line you will not believe some of the stuff they left out. The commentaries are also interesting and informative. I really liked a set they did on sound. I never realized how much sound was added after a scene was shot. <br /> <br />Hands down this is the best, most realistic cop drama ever done.

The title track is their usual, if there ever was such a thing. \\"Mein Teil\\" is Ministry-esque and very creepy if you know the story behind it. \\"Dalai Lama\\" is decent, but slow. \\"Keine Lust\\" is very odd, even for them. \\"Los\\" is my favorite song on the disc. it is very creative and nearly cafe style with it's acoustics. \\"Amerika\\" and \\"Moskau\\" are patriotic or anti-patriotic songs with a weird feel to them. \\"Morgenstern\\" is a choir-ish song with a special twist. \\"Stein um Stein\\" is their power anthem about stones. \\"Ohne Dich\\" and \\"Amour\\" are both love songs that are still very strong. this disc has been in my cd player since i got it 2 months ago.

B00005JNTX|4.0|For anyone seeking realistic sets, characters, or action... <br />For anyone hoping for toned-down nudity or sexuality... <br />For anyone feeling sickened by the relentless violence of today's most murderous movies... <br />For anyone looking for a calm movie night with the PTA... <br />This film is NOT for you - but it sure is cool. <br /> <br />If gratutious gore (albeit virtually all black and white and highly stylized) isn't your thing and you have a hang-up about on-screen nakedness, please don't watch this.  You'll hate it.  I don't know why anyone would seek out Frank Miller's seedy world of make-believe for character and plot realism, but apparently some people did, and those people hated the movie.  But on with a review... <br /> <br />I went to see this movie out of sheer curiosity (and a strong desire to see Elijah Wood as a bad guy - wacky, huh?) and found it to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while.  I'd never heard of Frank Miller, which I suppose means I live under a rock, but I had seen some fairly mediocre attempts at making comic-book worlds translate adequately to film (Joel Shumaker does \\"Batman,\\" for example - ok, mediocre is HIGHLY generous here).  \\"Sin City,\\" however, does absolutely no apologizing for the fictional Basin City's other-worldliness.  It takes the illustrator's vision head-on and makes it a moving picture, which is a new and fantastic idea, but maybe that's the real difference between a comic book and a graphic novel (well, that and 15 bucks). <br /> <br />Alright, the acting is stylized.  Big hairy deal.  It should be for this movie.  Clive Owen's American accent cracks me up, by the way.  Some of the actors pull off being evil characters a lot better than I thought they would, and some lend themselves to scummy parts naturally (ok, that was harsher than I meant it, Benicio).  As I said, Elijah Wood as Kevin was a big reason I saw it in the first place, and the creepiest thing about him is that, for crying out loud, it's the kid from \\"Radio Flyer\\" gone all Hannibal Lecter (except crazier & silent).  The women in the film aren't exactly the feminist ideal, but I doubt anyone would deny \\"deadly little Miho's\\" ability to make her point, or Rosario Dawson's ability to command respect.  Nick Stahl, um, looked better in \\"Terminator 3,\\" but in \\"Sin City\\" gives one of the most sickeningly twisted performances I'm sure he'll ever do.  I'm not a Bruce Willis fan, but he's good.  Mickey Rourke is incredible as Marv - just stinking incredible. <br /> <br />Overall, I really liked this movie, but I'm not sure I could like, watch it every day or anything, just because I think it would warp my fragile little mind.  The R rating is there for a reason - or 70 - so watch out.
B00000295Y|3.0|I think that this album was clearly misunderstood, and as this review unfolds, I am going to make it as clear as possible because for me, the way i feel about this album, is a touchy issue.Now,the reason I say this is because, their previous album before this one(cypress hill) it had more of a underground, gitty sound. Not to say that black sunday didn't have a gritty sound as well, but it was misunderstood because, a lot of heavy metalers, and 90's hippies, had started to listen ,and felt part of this sound.Like take for instance, I was about 13 1/2 when this album came out, and in the summer/fall of 1993 ,it was a big seller.When I first heard insane in the membrane, I was thinking damn ,dats a dope track but as a underground hip hoppin black kid ,from a suburb close to Toronto(west of) amongst a great amount of hip hop (east,west,north and south coast) I was listening to at the time, this was still a good album. But what I found is that people who never knew how to spell hip hop, nevermind listen to it were starting to and I quote \\"relate\\" to this album.I just couldn t comprehend how \\"skids\\", and \\"hippies\\" felt they could relate to it. I know that it has come to pass that this album is  an album for losers like the ones I described in my previous sentence to relate to, but I still think that this album is for hip hoppers to get bulnted to not \\"skids\\" or \\"hippies\\" LOL!.In fact, I got in a lot of fights with those wannabes for listening and claiming it as their own(and won most of them LOL!).If you are a hip hopper that  hasn' t listened to this album before it is a good album to get\\" blasted\\" to. songs like insane, and little puytos and A to the K, are a clear description of who they were not john lennon- beatle lovin, or metallica rockin nerds.but B real's voice is kind of a turn off ,but overall it's a deacent album(satisfactory).They kind of soldout by doin shows at lollapalloza, but they wanted to be stars and that 's why they're not respected in the hip hop world anymore.But that is just my opinion.But it is worh 10-15 bucks if you haven't heard it. THAT IS MY OPINION.

0783225202|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times, but can't resist seeing it even more. What other movie combines seat grabbing action, comedy, some of the best musical talent around, and suspense? The Blues Brothers, of course! The chemistry between Belushi and Akroyd had in this film is still unmatched, IMO, to this day. While there was the Blues Brothers 2000, I can't even bear to look at that re-make without Belushi in it.
6304698682|5.0|The Gold Rush in nineteenth-century California attracted all types of people seeking their fortunes.  Some would settle in small mining encampments where each had their claims to search for the precious ore, but greed could encourage some to try and drive people away from their claims.  Such was the setting for the 1985 film \\"Pale Rider\\", which was directed by Clint Eastwood.  Located a few miles from a small town, a mining encampment includes the hard-working Hull Barrett (Michael Moriarty), a woman that he's been living with named Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgrass) and her teenaged daughter Megan Wheeler (Sydney Penny).  Frustrated with rising bills at the nearby country store and a greedy & wealthy man named Coy LaHood (Richard A. Dysart) who is trying to drive away the miners, Hull and Sarah's relationship is somewhat strained.  After Megan prays for assistance and is reading a verse in the Book of Revelation that states \\"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death\\" (Rev. 6:8), she sees a man riding a pale horse approaching.  The rider comes to be known only as \\"The Preacher\\" (Clint Eastwood) and after helping Hull out of a skirmish with some of LaHood's men, Hull invites the Preacher to stay with him, Sarah and Megan. It isn't before long that the Preacher begins to give the miners at Hull's encampment courage to stand up to LaHood and to work together.  LaHood, of course, is furious that a preacher is helping them because he wants their land so that he can use his very destructive hydraulic mining technology to strip the land of whatever gold may be there.  When LaHood can't buy the Preacher out of the encampment, he resorts to hiring a \\"marshal\\" of sorts named Stockburn (John Russell, 1921-1991) and his \\"deputies\\" to get rid of the Preacher.  LaHood, however, doesn't know what the Preacher is capable of doing. <br /> <br />With excellent cinematography, interesting characters, an engaging story and good acting, \\"Pale Rider\\" isan excellent film.  Other memorable characters include LaHood's son Josh (Chris Penn), Club (Richard Kiel, who is better known for his portrayal of the character \\"Jaws\\" from the James Bond films \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" & \\"Moonraker\\" in 1977 & 1979 respectively), McGill (Charles Hallahan), Ma Blankenship (Fran Ryan, 1916-2000) and Jed Blankenship (Richard Hamilton, 1920-2004).  Memorable scenes include the Preacher's arrival, the boulder, visiting LaHood's hydraulic mine, the arrival of Stockburn and the final scenes.  Overall, I rate \\"Pale Rider\\" with 5 stars.
0156027321|4.0|As an agnostic/hopeful skeptic (something that Pi calls \\"missing the better story,\\")I found Pi's youthful optimism about God and religion to be refreshing in a way. Part one is definitely where the story shines. Martel has a gift when it comes to dialogue. The book's few conversations were probably the most enjoyable part of the book for me. If only authors didn't feel compelled to add thickness to their books and break that 300+ page mark. Part 2 needlessly goes on for too long. I would still highly recommend this book even though the middle is tedious at times. I think I'll give it four and a half stars; the other half star went down the drain when I had to read 50 pages about Pi repeatedly killing various ocean creatures and then hacking them to bits.

B000244FDW|5.0|This 1979 BBC production of  \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" based on a classic novel by Jane Austen, about the morals, mores, marriages and the class system in Georgian England, is superb! The casting is perfect, with one exception. Although David Rintoul delivers a good performance as the proud Fitzwilliam Darcy, I am one of those Colin Firth fans who can imagine no other in the role. Please don't hold it against me. I admit to my own prejudice! Directed by Cyril Coke (known for his other Masterpiece Theater work including \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\"), the script was written by novelist Fay Weldon, who perfectly translates the novel's witty dialogue to the screen. This adaptation includes some original scenes, as does the A&E version. Here, Lizzy converses with her Aunt Gardiner on the subject of Mr. Wickham. She admits there's a possibility he is a scoundrel and promises not to be taken in by him. There's also the scene concerning Mr. Collin's \\"Aquatic Life Hat\\". And Malcolm Rennie's portrayal of Mr. Collins is terrific. It is obvious that this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" had a more limited budget than did the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. While the latter film is set in England's luxurious estates and country homes, this one uses television settings. Shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater in 1980, the movie was released in DVD format in an uninterrupted 225 minute 2 disc set, which has been digitally remastered.<br /><br />The film clearly reflects Ms. Austin's theories on the importance of marriage for women of the period. Most women were not educated, except for the social graces; acquiring, at least, some proficiency in music, needlework and \\"acceptable\\" literature, and learning skills essential to running a household. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry well, to obtain financial security and social position, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare.<br /><br />The film opens in a small community in Hertfordshire, England. Word is out that the empty Netherfield estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage, and, of course, gossiping. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well and settled, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also. Marriage is a serious business in this period.<br /><br />There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, (Osmond Bullock), the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, (Sabina Franklyn), the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett (Ms. Garvie), the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy, (Rintoul). Darcy, is much wealthier than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene and looks down his nose at the local gentry. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She has a strong intellect and her father had encouraged her to become literate, and to enjoy fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, spirited, with a sharp wit, more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.<br /><br />Elizabeth and Darcy's strong mutual attraction, and the conflict between them, which prevents them from forming a potentially rich relationship, provide an interesting tension throughout the film. Darcy's proud arrogance in his social class and position, and Elizabeth's prejudice against such haughtiness, seem to inhibit all promise of romance.<br /><br />Ms. Austin's delightful characters, are brilliantly cast here, including: George Wickham, (Peter Settelen), a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, (Rennie), a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennetts, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, (Irene RIchard), a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, (A superb Judy Parfitt), the quintessential aristocrat. Elizabeth Garvie is a superb Lizzy Bennett. She sparkles with wit and intelligence, and is just beautiful enough to be believable. As I mentioned above, David Rintoul is a believable Darcy, but my personal preference is clear.<br /><br />The settings and costumes are accurate to the period. The dialogue is faithful to the novel. Watching the film, it is almost impossible not to feel transported back in time, and become very involved with the loves, foibles, problems, and adventures of the wonderful Austin characters, brought so realistically to life, in this amazing production.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I think both A&E and BBC productions are excellent and find many aspects that I like in both. I own both DVDs and watch them frequently. I'm a fan!! A 5 Star BRAVO!<br /><br />JANAt than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly.

6303542352|4.0|No question about Richardson's bravura performance as the man we love to hate -- or is it the man we hate to love? However, what is NOT made clear on the package is that this edition is abridged from the original broadcasts to fit some \\"ideal\\" length. The editors may have considered the cuts \\"insignificant\\", but they account for abrupt transitions and other annoyances. At least they had the sense to leave Seed's leitmotif shots of rats in.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|Coach Carter tells a great story and provokes a lot of thought about why some cultures consistently fail.  The film itself was good, but given the subject matter, it could have been a 5 star film.    Samuel Jackson is very convincing in his role, and the young men who act as his players are well cast.  This film had a lot in common with Hoosiers, which is the best basketball film ever made.  Like Hoosiers, you have an inspiring story with twists and turns.  How you feel about the movie beyond that depends on what your personal preferences are.  If you like basketball (unlike the Amazon.com official review shown above), you will enjoy the well-choreographed basketball sequences.  If you are in to rap music, you may like the soundtrack.  My problem with the film is that I'm not a big rap music fan.  Also, I don't feel the need to hear profane ghetto talk thoughout some of the movie.  The movie seemed to be aimed at young rapsters, which is fine. Since I'm not a young rapster, I didn't enjoy some aspects of the movie.  Nonetheless, this was a good movie over all.    This was not a movie for those under 13, as the rating indicates.  The language is poor, there are some sexual scenes, and the abortion issue (a distraction to the film) is present.    The movie does bring up the question of why some cultures fail.  I liked the fact that this film made it a cultural issue instead of a race issue by having various races on the team and at the school.  We see that some cultures simply don't understand that academics are required to get ahead in the modern world.  This total lack of an educational emphasis keeps some groups behind, even if there is no racism.  The ray of hope is Coach Carter.  He refuses to believe that his kids can't do it.  He chooses to believe that the kids can do it and that he, one man, can make a major difference.  This segment of the story is so inspiring that I wish this film could be shown to all ages.  However, maybe the message will reach young menand women who can still make a difference in their own lives.  History has shown that individuals from poor cultures can make choices that lead them to become successful, regardless of the obstacles.    The DVD has a story on the real Coach Carter that is worth a look.
1573223026|5.0|Although Nick Hornby is forever remembered for what has been stamped \\"lad lit\\"--books about male obsessions like football (soccer) and rock music and maturation--his latest output by far has been about broader themes.  Without sacrificing wit, slapstick comedy, pulsing rhythm, intimate voice or ability to nail the piercingly significant moments in life, he's moved out into the world.  His last novel, HOW TO BE GOOD, was written from a woman's perspective and explored morality, though with his usual comic voice intact.  His new fiction, A LONG WAY DOWN, takes on suicide and is written in four very different voices.  It is one of Hornby's best to date, if not the best. <br /> <br />Essentially, the four characters are Martin, an urbane television celebrity who brought on his own fall from grace after coupling with a 15-year-old; JJ, an American in a rock band, who has lost his band and his girl; Maureen, a woman who has been paying for her single, youthful sexual encounter by raising its product, a now adult son who has never exited his severely disabled, vegetative state; and the teenager from hell, Jess.  The heretofore strangers have all gone to throw themselves off a London rooftop on New Year's Eve and end up bonding uneasily because of it, trying to make sense of their lives, why they had gone up there and how they might go on living afterward.  A lot happens as they try and muddle on, but it would ruin all the surprises to speak further of them.  <br /> <br />The book has a fast current, never bogs down.  There are a lot of jokes hidden like Easter Eggs.  A character from HOW TO BE GOOD is reprised very briefly and ironically, and Hornby channels a lot of his literary allusions through JJ, the high school drop-out from America, named for a distinguished British historian.  What I find ultimately attractive about Hornby's novel is his searing sense of decency, of the fragile wall between being and nothingness, and the keen awareness of what should and doesn't always constitute the differentiated states of childhood, adolescence and maturity. <br />
1573223026|4.0|Hornby has once again come up big with A Long Way Down. Though darker than his usual themes, though About a Boy was rough too, this book adds the appropriate amount of levity, without seeming like it isn't taking the subject matter seriously. I'd say this is his 3rd best novel, though in overall scope it may be behind Fever Pitch if you include all his writings. Money well spent.

Unless you are into stupid movies like Bio-Dome..don't waste your time on this hideous comedy. You'll be thanking me later.

0380977788|3.0|The best way to describe this book is: numb. Neil Gaiman centers the story around a stick figure. The little girl seems to only be there to tell you about this alternate world. That world is creepy and created well by Gaiman. Unfortunately, the jaded personality of the main character works against Gaiman because she's just to shallow to really care about. During the climax and other parts of the story you tend to be fascinated by the creepy world and fairly indifferent to the plight of the little girl. That keeps the story from having any true suspense. Can you really enjoy a book when you don't care about it's main character?

B0002PUHF6|4.0|Every once in a while a horror film deliberately sets out to be a tongue in cheek lampoon of its genre.  One such was Alligator, which took the 'man eating monster in a cave' film to its illogical conclusion.  Another is Re-Animator, which set out to define a genre (films based on Lovecraft) at the very same time it lampooned the style.  For H. P. Lovecraft's work has eluded all efforts to transfer the stories to film (the closest are In The Mouth of Madness and The Dunwich Horror), and Director Stuart Gordon may very well have figured out why.<br /><br />The film is based on H.P. Lovecraft's Re-Animator, a short story series written in the early 1920's about a pair of medical students who were obsessed with bringing the dead back to life - with inevitably unpleasant results.  Screenwriters Dennis Paoli, William Norris and Stuart Gordon have updates the story to the 1980's, throwing in a love interest and even some gratuitous nudity.  Medical student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) has moved into a house that is a bit beyond his means, and his quest for a roommate introduces him to Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs).  West (as the viewer know from an introductory snippet) has returned from Switzerland where he studied (and re-animated) Dr. Gruber.  West is the classic mad scientist type, willing to do just about anything to get fresh bodies for his experiments.<br /><br />West's experiments quickly get Cain in trouble with the medical school and estranged from his girl friend Megan Halsey (Barbara Crampton).  Her father, Dean Alan Halsey (Robert Sampson) is an early West subject who is then lobotomized by Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) who is motivated by a desire to steal West's ideas and a weird yen for Megan.  The film climaxes in a frantic laboratory scene which is the primary reason for me deciding to re-title the film 'Parts.''<br /><br />All of this is done with a straight face, but the acting is so bad it really is funny.  Lovecraft's greatest skill is his ability to craft purple prose, but that never translates well to the screen.  As a result, West's declamations are overdone and Cain can't help but play a bumbler unable to resist the clarion calls of his housemate.  By the time Dr. Hill's head (carried about by his body) starts seducing poor Megan, all is hopeless.  Without Lovecraft's writing ability to keep the atmospherics working, the action dissolves into pure parody.  If you hunger after perfect schlock horror, look no further.  As is sometimes the case, bad is good.er translates well to the screen.

B0009I7NNA|1.0|[...]    I was very excited when I learned that Avenged Sevenfold was coming out with their new album, City of Evil. Waking the Fallen just blew me away the first time I heard it. I much expected the same with CoE. The plan was to go purchase the cd the first day it came out. Sadly, or at least at the time so, I had to work. I wasn't quite happy. My roommate, who is a \\"MTV teeny-bopper\\" who has no knowledge of any \\"good\\" music besides of what MTV says is good, went out on the first day and got the cd. I was jealous to say the least. I told him about Avenged Sevenfold and he has the audacity to buy it first. So I listened to it...    At first I was in shock. This couldn't be Avenged Sevenfold. But, it was. Have they changed? So it seems. All metal. It really seems like some haggard attempt to sound like old Metallica. Old Metallica is not good. New Metallica is not good. I'm not exactly into the whole \\"metal\\" scene. It really seems like someone was hanging the \\"carrot in front of the donkey\\" on this cd. The carrot symbolizing a rather \\"idealistic\\" promise of radio airplay. And the donkey... I'm sure you get the picture. \\"Let's go radio!\\" is what I can hear the producer saying...    I plan on receiving much criticism on this review but it is the truth. They are no longer good. I'll stay and listen to Waking the Fallen over and over. CoE needs to stay away and be thrown away. I'd rather work on a farm the rest of my life than hear this cd again. Truthfully. [...]

B0001KL3SW|4.0|Amy Winehouse is featured on many British compilation CD's and so I decided to finally pick up the CD and I am so glad that I did!!  Amy Winehouse delivers the perfect blend of jazz and r&amp;b.  Her unique vocals are definitely refreshing.  It is a well produced CD and I would highly recommend it.  Think Billie Holiday mixed with the soul of Mary J!!

B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer takes the beautiful lyrics and melodic guitar sound of The Bends and adds an experimental taste to it to make an extraordinary album.All songs are strong and have lovely twists. No wonder it got compared with the Pink Floyd,some of the instrumental parts echoes the sound of the progressive rock masters very clearly. <br /> <br />Airbag: Strong opener with strange dreamy guitar sounds. <br />Paranoid Android: multi layered epic that owes a lot of it's sound to Pink Floyd. <br />Subterranean Homesick Alien: borrowed title from Bob Dylan,but that's where the comparisement ends.Stunning sound that stays in your head and haunts you for days to come.One of the absolute highlights of the album.Even more so,only the closing track is better,if you ask me. <br />Exit Music(for a film): Fragile lyrics sung by Yorke as if it were his last words.We hope that you choke,I listened to this song on the night of Live 8 and it gave me the chills. <br />Let Down: Instantly appealing opening riff that keeps strong during the entire song. <br />Karma Police: Good first section,brilliant second section. I lost myself in this song... <br />Fitter Happier: reminds me in a way of Providence from the masterpiece Daydream Nation by Sonic Youth.Same strange voice and a eerie background.Also just like Providence an interlude in the record. <br />Electioneering: The only real rocker on the album.It really rocks though. <br />Climbing up the Walls: Great drum sound and a Sonic Youth like closing bit with the guitars noising up in a quiet way. <br />No Surprises: Probably the most recognisable melody of Radiohead.Stuff to listen to at the end of a party when you're chilling on a couch. <br />Lucky: Wonderfully sung ballad with great musical sound.One of the greatest songs on the album. <br />The Tourist: Save the best for last! This song takes your breath away,at least that did it for me.Never heard Yorke sing so beautiful and the chorus is so pretty and heart wrenching that you can listen to it 10 times in a row. <br /> <br />It is said that OK Computer is a depressive album,that the music is for moments when you feel down.But the opposite is true! Yes,I let it hear to friends of mine and they all said that it was depressive,but don't believe them!!! OK Computer is one of the most positive albums I've ever heard.Songs like Subterranean... and The Tourist bring a smile to my face and make me think of all the great things in life.It is a peaceful record that should give pleasure to everyone who enjoys alternative and dreamy rock.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Once in a while, you stumble upon a show that hooks you in at the beginning, then slowly it begins to lose your interest for a while then maybe near the end leave you perhaps intrigued enough to tune in next season. <br />Well, once in a blue moon do you stumble upon a show that hooks you in at the beginning only to build intensity and quality as the show progresses, leaving your heart to race on many ocassions, building momentum as it comes to a spectacular final three episodes evoking emotions such as joy, shock, rage, and sadness all at the same time. Ladies, gentlemen, young adults, teenagers Veronica Mars IS this type of show! <br />This little UPN show proved itself as the next craze...even though it had to go up against some tough competition in the form of Law and Order:SUV, House, Amazing Race, and One Tree Hill. Nonetheless, a devoted fan base emerged creating much talk and debate among show plot lines, characters and couples.<br />Veronica Mars is a show centered by a young, sassy, intelligent, spy woman (often referred to the Nancy Drew of the 21st century) who has a few issues that all stem from one event, her best friends murder: <br />First the obvious, Who killed Lilly Kane?<BR>Also, after her father wrongfully accuses Lillys father for her murder, Veronica is torn to chose who she will stand by, her father now an outcast, fired as detective , or the popular circle of friends who think shes now crazy. Needless to say she loses her friends and her boyfriend (Lillys brother ) but gains a chip on the shoulder and a heck of a lot of determination in order to re-gain her fathers respect and put Lillys ghost to rest by making it her mission to solve her murder.<BR>And if thats not enough, she was also drug raped at a party, and has no idea what happened that night. <br />These mysteries and questions are the major plot arcs of the season...they are all raised at the beginning of the season and finally answered in the finale two episodes. Howwe get from the beginning to the grand finale is pure, poetic television! Sure there are the minor plot lines in-between, and the episodic mysteries much like Smallville was first season...but there is no rock left unturned...the writers and producers thought of everything, and leave their audience feeling excited and satisfied at the end...as well as a little crazy because there is another cliff hanger that leaves you wanting more! <br />Now the actors headed by Kristen Bell (Veronica), her father played by Enrico Colontoni and Perry Daggs III as the best friend Wallace give outstanding performances. They are supported by Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls) who makes you want to love and hate his character, Francis Capra as Weevil our lovable bad-boy, and Teddy Dunn who is Veronica's ex Duncan Kane. Many diss Dunns performance but I believe he really came into his own near the second half of the season and surpassed all my expectations during the final two episodes. In all, I guess what I'm getting at is that the show is well-casted, and this is hard to do considering that the supporting cast (there are many more I have not mentioned) is a large number of characters important to the progression and suspense of the major plot lines, because they make their characters believable the audience in turn can be taken in so easily by this story and truly care about these characters.<br />I'm glad they're coming out with this season before season two begins because it only means that more people are going to be taken by this series. There are 22 episodes plus extras included are:<br />&quot;a Director's Cut of the Pilot episode, plus 25 minutes of unaired scenes and bloopers&quot; (tvshowsondvd.com)<br />I know the extras are few but the producers and the network wanted to get this out as soon as possible, so hopefully they will make up for extras on the season two set!<br />Just know, that you will not be able to stop watching once you've started...my cousin and I got to the point where we couldn't have anybody else making noise in the room when we were watching mars and by the finale we were going crazy jumping up and down and screaming at the screen! This show is a can't miss for any mystery lover...and well, for anyone who appreciates strong willed protagonist like Veronica Mars, you'll be cheering her on the whole way through.
B000003TAL|5.0|Daydream Nation is my favorite album at the moment.It is a divine excursion into indie rock.Combining the usual noise with breathtaking melodic guitar solo's this is the ultimate art rock album.All songs are great,no superb! The album starts of with an unforgettable 1,2,3,4 knock out that goes from sublime to indie rock heaven. <br /> <br />1: Teen Age Riot> probably the most famous track on the album.A true anthem for every rock fan.Combining fierce guitar work and the attacking drums of Steve Shelley with the revolutionary message of Thurston Moore. <br />2: Silver Rocket> pure punk rock with an unbelievable noise explosion in the middle of the track. Again combining the instrumental genius of the band with strong lyrics sung by Thurston Moore. <br />3: The Sprawl: Like the title says,this is a sprawling track.Starting of as seemingly a regular rock song,it then changes after about 3 minutes into a hauntingly beautiful feedback of guitars with Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore playing superb here.Brings tears to your eyes,but it has to be heard a couple of times to really appreciate it. <br />4: 'Cross the Breeze: welds into the prior song so easily that both songs can be seen as one. this track though is Sonic Youth at their very best.Combining perfect guitar work (just before Kim Gordon starts singing there is one of the most brilliant guitar riffs in music history) with the screaming voice of Gordon (I wanna know!!!).Absolute great lyrics also: Let's go walkin' on the water, now you think I'm Satan's daughter... has got three sections really,an opening instrumental part,the singing mid section and a vicous instrumental finale.It ends just like it starts.7 minutes of rock perfection! <br />5: Eric's Trip: Sounds less great to me than it is,since you've just been blown away by the first 4 songs.Still,it is a great rock song with the usual speaking voice of Lee Ranaldo.Very noisy and very trippy. <br />6: Total Trash: Just like all the other songs on this album,it has surprises.Starting of as a \\"standard\\" rock song it goes down into an unbelievable noise jam in the mid section.Pure improvised trash by the masters of noise rock. <br />7: Hey Joni: Raunching rock song with strong and attacking guitar work.Again great lyrics sung by Ranaldo. <br />8: Providence: Seen by a lot of people as the lesser song of the album.Not correct! It is very dreamy and very experimental with beautiful piano sound and a stormy background combined with hallucinating words. <br />9: Candle: Starts off beautifully calm and stays that way for quitte a while,but it isn't calm at all.Yet,in comparison with the other tracks it looks that way. <br />10: Rain King: Brilliant exploding start and it doesn't back down one bit.Superb floating voice by Lee Ranaldo and guitars. <br />11: Kissability: If there was ever one slightly lesser song on the album then I think it's this one.Maybe a little bit to commercial in comparison with the other tracks.Looks in that way a bit like Bubblegum on the EVOL album.Still, a great song. <br />12: Trilogy: The perfect closer.Like all masterpieces in music this album ends with a masterpiece of it's own.A long epic track that lasts 14 minutes and contains 3 levels.A hard rocking opening (The Wonder),a post rock like mid section (Hyperstation) and a vicious and raw finale (Eliminator Jr.). <br /> <br />Daydream Nation is seen as one of the musical milestones of the eighties and quite rightly so.It combines different styles of rock music although always concentrating on underground indie rock.Therefore,it is not as famous as commercial albums of that time.Even worse,not a lot of people know of this album which is a shame.Sonic Youth were not just innovators,they were top of the bill.Together with Velvet Underground (and maybe Pink Floyd) they are the most important rock band in history,no doubt about that for me.They laid the path for bands like Nirvana and paid the price for it,since they remained pretty unknown in mainstream music world.If you listen to this album though,you can hear the importance of the band on all future rock bands as did The VU in the late sixties.Sonic Youth is my favorite band and Daydream Nation is their absolute masterpiece.Listen to it a couple of times to discover the secrets and become captivated by it's brilliance. <br />For everyone who loves rock music!!!
B0006L16N8|2.0|I enjoyed Coldplay's first 2 albums.  This however is crap.  There is nothing innovative at all on the disc.  It is as if they found a formula for what sells their music and stuck within that framework alone.  The annoying elements of earlier work were used at every turn and it ammounts to recycled, manufactured, trash.  To whatever critic compared them to radiohead:  HOW DARE YOU!
B000002TQV|4.0|I borrowed the album from my roommate who always told me that the music of Radiohead was brilliant,I never really tohught that it was that great,until I listened to this album.It has several unforgettable songs like Fake Plastic Trees,Nice Dream and of course Street Spirit.Great guitar sound and pretty accessible songs if you compare it to the (better if you ask me) follow up OK Computer. <br /> <br />There are no real weak spots or it has to be Iron Lung which I don't like much. <br /> <br />A must listen record!
B00004WLXZ|3.0|There is a lot of hype around Triumph of the Will, and the way you hear about it, you expect some kind of horror. Sure, Hitler's up to his usual screaming fits, but it's all relatively tame. The Nazi esthetic - like the shots of people from below and at an angle, to make them look brave and tall, or the abundant flags - really comes to the fore in this movie, but the content is relatively banal. If you've seen one parade of tens of thousands of bureaucrats or soldiers (in the Nazi party, the distinction was somewhat blurred), you've seen them all. There is a particularly bizarre part where fanatic-looking agricultural workers do a little theater for Hitler, which brings much levity, at least to the modern viewer. I imagine a German from the thirties would have found it stirring. AS for me, I amused myself every time Hess came to the screen by saying \\"what, you're not gone yet ?\\".
B00004XQ83|1.0|Potential buyers beware! This is not an audio CD. It has no audio tracks. It can only be listened to on the computer. I don't know why they call this enhanced. It should be called decapacitated. Songs are OK, that why the single star is there.
0613325419|4.0|This was a charming book, but I wish there had been more to it.  Given the lenths of the Harry Potter books themselves, I would have thought this would be more in depth!
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies yet. I was honestly not expecting much and just expecting to see just another Batman film with yet another actor playing Batman. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was, and what a great job Christian Bale (American Psycho) did. I had no desire to even see this film and I was really glad I did. This movie is dark but not as dark as some of the earlier films. What makes this Batman stand out is that like the Spider-Man movies this has just the right amount of action and drama. I will not give any details about the movie as not to spoil it for people who have not seen it, but I will say Batman Begins is in the tradition of Spider-Man and it is truly worth checking out.
6305433909|5.0|This sequel to \\"Sister Act 1\\" is as good as the first movie.  Whoopie does a fabulous job.  A great family movie.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|One thing must be said about Avenged Sevenfold, and that is they are among the few metal bands that can be listened to over and over again. <br />Avenged Sevenfold's cds each have their own distinct sound and City of Evil is one of their best.  With the catchy, driving, and overall technical guitar lines from Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance, this cd definately sets them apart from the rest.  <br />If you've listened to A7X before this cd, you'll definately notice one thing, and that is M. Shadows' voice is much different and it takes some getting used to, but it is very good and he has definately improved as a singer.  His voice really adds a lot of the older feel to this cd and that was a good choice on their part (to go for the old feel). <br />The Rev's drumming in this cd is absolutely incredible, a little repetitive in some parts (all the double kicking), but either way, he's a great drummer.  Also, something new is heard in this cd and that is Johnny Christ's bass line (ha). <br />Anyway, away from all of my rambling, I'd say this cd still isn't as good as Waking the Fallen, but it is better than Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. <br />Amazing Band...pick it up.
B000001GBJ|4.0|The 2nd?  Well you may differ. <br /> <br />Here are my picks (don't get me wrong, they are all great!): <br /> <br />#1 Earthsongs (2005) <br />Just the best. <br /> <br />#2 Songs From A Secret Garden (1996)   <br />Pure magic. <br /> <br />#3 Dawn Of A New Century (1999)  <br />Very spiritual. <br /> <br />#4 Once In A Red Moon (2001)    <br />Touches very deep chords. <br /> <br />#5 Dreamcatcher (2001)    <br />Enchanting and lush. <br /> <br />#6 White Stones (1997)    <br />Early sounds that still move me. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000024D4R|5.0|To read a shockingly bad, poorly-written review of this classic, see the lowest rated reviews listed here; there are quite a few. I say this because low intellect seems to go hand-in-hand with disdain for something so well-made.<br /><br />\\"Animals\\" is book-ended with \\"Pigs on the Wing,\\" parts 1 and 2, a simple, one-voice song, Roger Waters singing, and strumming only an acoustic guitar as accompaniment. It seems to ease the listener into the body of \\"Animals,\\" and gives a soft landing at the end.<br /><br />\\"Dogs\\" is is a magnum opus that clocks in at over seventeen minutes, and if you think it's literally a song about dogs, you are quite mistaken. The life of a dog figures in, of course, but it's a person, fighting to get ahead, learning \\"to strike when the moment is right, without thinking.\\"<br />The middle section, where the tempo slows down, takes the listener to the last moments of someone's life, the fear and despondency of dying alone, abandoned, \\"Dragged down by the stone.\\" This could be a person, or the old dog that someone callously gets rid of, because he, or she, isn't useful anymore. The surrealistic passage that follows, is the end of life, swirling to the bottom, waiting for death to ease the sense of aloneness, abandonment, and dejection, the sounds of whistles and muted barks being all that's left of this soon-to- end life.<br /><br />The music then returns to the opening theme, Waters singing this time, instead of Gilmour, a different life, someone else rushing to get ahead now, a different stray dog roaming the streets, fighting the paranoia of knowing persecution, the sense that you \\"believe at heart everyone's a killer.\\"<br /><br />The final verse chronicles the cycle of life, from being \\"born in a house full of pain,\\"  going to school for indoctrination, being \\"broken by trained personnel,\\" finding your own way in life, \\"breaking away from the pack,\\" and dying, being \\"dragged down by the stone.\\"<br />In all, pretty heavy, and we're only halfway through it.<br /><br />\\"Pigs(three different ones) opens the second half, and I remember reading that Roger Waters played rhythym guitar on this song, with David Gilmour overdubbing the bass, as well as his lead guitar duties; if you listen, that is not Water's bass style. On stage, Snowy White played guitar and bass to suppliment the band on the '77 \\"Animals\\" tour. I also think that's Waters playing acoustic on \\"Dogs,\\" as well.<br />Each verse of \\"Pigs\\" is dedicated to a different person,the first, the often gluttonous sloth who who keeps looking, and pretending to be important. The fat-cat businessman, the snuffling polititian.<br />Pig number two, is self-explanatory, bus stop rat bag, the degenerate you'd do best to just stay away from.<br /><br />I love the instrumental to this song, the repetition of the same two parts, getting more intense each time, vocoder imitating pig grunts, turning into hair-raising squeals, then long sustained notes, the ugliness of a pig sty, and the granduer of vintage Pink Floyd-style progressive rock.<br /><br />The third pig is obviously Mary Whitehouse, Waters turning his disdain and legendary sarcasm at her, with her \\"tight lips and cold feet,\\" telling her she's \\"nearly a treat, but really a cry.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sheep\\" is the third part of this behemoth, a quiet, mellow, jazzy beginning, sheep noises in the background, and suddenly, the hardest rock the Floyd has ever done. I've often criticized the singing style of Roger Waters, but he is in top form here, railing full throttle at society's persistent followers, \\"dimly aware of a certain unease in the air,\\" that the aforementioned dogs are coming for them. Possibly the most gruesome depictions of life's unpleasant moments are told of here; \\"Meek and obedient, you follow the leader down well-trodden corridors, into the valley of steel,\\" plainly, the slaughterhouse. I think of Agent Starling's account of the lamb she tried to save when she was young, and how she felt in her failure to do so, from Thomas Harris' \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\" The screams as they are being slaughtered, and her helplessness to do anything about it, echo Waters' warning to people not to blindly follow, it will cost you, and dearly, you poor, harmless, helpless sheep.<br />The adaptation of the 23rd Psalm, is worth the price of the whole disc, \\"...he maketh me to hang on hooks, in high places, he converteth me to lamb cutlets...\\"<br /><br />By the time it fades into the sounds of sheep in the meadow, you have about forty-five minutes of really heavy, not so pleasant music about life, and the not-so-pleasant people you meet in life, unflinchingly told through the metaphors of animals, all of which are, ironically, usually pleasant animals. Gotta say, though, I've heard pigs squeal, and it's a sound you don't soon forget.<br /><br />And, of course, \\"Pigs on the Wing, part 2\\" closes this, a gentle farewell that closes the book. So, ignore the bad reviews; this is a masterpiece.are being slaughtered, and her helplessness to do anything about it, echo Waters' warning to people not to blindly follow, it will cost you, and dearly, you poor, harmless, helpless sheep.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|<br />Days after listening to this CD I can hear their voices in my mind.  They have a rare gift for song.  Not just the simple emoting of words but that rare conjunction of harmony and spirit. <br /> <br />Each could stand alone as a master of her craft, but together they synergize into something more.  A fusion of styles centered around the Celtic tradition.  Though the word \\"Celtic\\" fails to do their genre justice because they expand far beyond that boundary. <br /> <br />While those looking for traditional Celtic music may not find what they are looking for here, anyone who enjoys classically performed music should find something to love. <br /> <br />And if you have an eclectic love of many styles then at least try out the samples.  There is a good chance they have something to offer you. <br /> <br />All I truly know is that I love listening to the music, and I love the way their voices stay with me.  I hope you enjoy this music as much as I do. <br /> <br />
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Because Vincent is my friend, you'll think my opinion is biased, but now that that is out of the way, here goes...  <br /> <br />Vincent said to me one day, \\"Bunny, I'd like to make a movie about you.\\", and I said \\"Sure. As long as it has absolutely nothing to do with me, and so long as it has lots of aliens, a carnival scene, killer special effects using monster trucks, and a few people eating cereal.\\"  <br /> <br />But it didn't turn out that way, such is life. The only suggestion of mine that I demanded be included in the film was the monster truck stuff. But instead, Vincent had motorcycles. But that was OK because he can ride em' pretty well. <br /> <br />Anyways, now that I have established my credibility, on to the movie review. I never actually saw the film. I just know a lot about it, because Vincent and I spoke about it all the time over tea in the afternoons.  <br /> <br />He assured my it was a great film but had his doubts. I believed him because he was so sincere and he also spent hours and hours designing the posters and all. Besides, why would someone go through all the trouble picking out the perfect colour for a poster for a film that was like, not great in the first place? <br /> <br />Between filming, we watched a few episodes of Twilight Zone, and we liked some of the songs in one of them, so he included it in the film. I'm not sure, but I think the character in The Brown Bunny had some similar struggles with the particular character in the Twilight Zone episode. <br /> <br />So if you like Twilight Zone episodes, I have no idea whether or not you'd like The Brown Bunny or not, because people can be so wishy-washy all the time. This guy likes Planet of the Apes and Seinfeld, while that gal likes The King and I and Soilent Green.  <br /> <br />You never know. You pigeon-hole something one day, and you end up pulling out a rabbit the next.

Though I enjoy his new albums, I always find myself ranging back to this time. <br /> <br />I also suggest these Yanni CDs: <br />If I Could Tell You <br />Love Songs <br />Dare To Dream <br />In Celebration Of Life <br />Out Of Silence <br />Port Of Mystery <br />Winter Light <br />In The Mirror <br /> <br />Well I could go on but this is a good start. <br /> <br />You should also check out Enya, John Tesh, Kitaro, California Guitar Trio, and Alistair Fraiser (each in my mind represents a side of Yanni music, though Yanni is the fusion of the best of all of these). <br /> <br />If you are new to Yanni this is easily the best place to start. <br /> <br />
0553802534|4.0|I really enjoyed this easy to read and very intriguing mystery!  I was hooked from the first chapter and I didn't want to put down the book.  There were plenty of twists and turns to keep me guessing...even into the last pages.  The story centers around Bobby, a police sniper, who gets caught up in a murder, a lot of dead bodies, and a very mysterious woman...is she the victim or the mastermind behind it all?

B000022TSW|5.0|I absolutely love South Park. What these two Colorado guys have done is nothing short of political genious. They can disguise political points in profanity and humor and yet still slam them home better than anybody else in Hollywood (Michael Moore would be wise to watch a little South Park and learn how to really present politics). This movie follows the trend of nearly every other SP episode, albeit they throw in an ungodly amount of profanity since they can. I am amazed at the number of people who say that religious conservatives (i.e. \\"those Christian bastards\\") should stay away, that they would be offended. NO WAY! WATCH THIS MOVIE AND EVERY OTHER SP EPISODE! Find out what our moderate libertarian friends are doing to show the absolute stupidity of our liberal anti-American friends. Granted, they do a good job of making fun of both sides, us Christians too, but we would be foolish to get all up in arms over it. I understand that we deserve to be poked fun at. I think Matt said it best when he said, \\"I hate Conservatives, but I f*cking hate Liberals\\". South Park has no love for Michael Moore, Sean Penn, Matt Damon, Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, Barbara Streisand, Jesse Jackson, Nazis, vegetarians, hippies, Mormons, and the like (in all fairness, the Christians get a pounding here and there, but I must admit, we can be crazy and it's pretty freaking hysterical). They actually support America, and this movie shows it. And we get a bonus, they make the Canadians and French out to be good-for-nothing, cept maybe a little fart humor. So, for other neo-cons, don't get all up in arms about this movie, they are on the side of the Right. Let it run its course because it is stealing the minds of Liberals across this nation, and the greatest thing is, the Liberals don't have a clue. They are on our side, and the amazing thing is, South Park will be defended by liberals till our political juggernaut of American politics finally shifts toward the right. Amazing.
6305922756|5.0|it's really quite alright to love,be obsessed with, and endlessly quote a classic like Spinal Tap if you have one or two like minded individuals around who can tolerate it. so to all those out there who know all the lyrics to \\"Sex Farm\\" \\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Gimme Some Money\\" i salute you. it's just a movie, but it could it be more funny? the answer is none,none more funny......
0812550706|5.0|This is my favorite book hands down.  Picked it up and read it in one day.  Then, went out and bought the next one.  Read that in one day.  Read the third one in the series in one day too.
0517543052|5.0|While the hippie movement was a disparate phenomenon, if there were to be one book that stood out as the hippie bible, it would be this book.  I read it as originally printed, when it was in a larger, all brown paper format.  I'd love to have one of those.  After that, I got the regular edition for myself...still have it over 3 decades later.    I think this is a unique and very beautiful book, as well as reflecting something worthwhile from those times, something that had a lasting value for many of us.    Update (2/9/2006):  I found a copy of the 11x11\\" original edition of Be Here Now, which was entitled \\"From Bindu to Ojas.\\"   This was the core book, in brown craft paper 3-hole punched and bound simply with twine, one of the four parts of what was to become Be Here Now.  I want to pass it down to my son and grandchildren.   Priceless.    Berry Ives
0767817478|2.0|This is NOT a Godzilla film!  Having Godzilla in the title is why I give it two stars.  Take out the Godzilla title, and it goes to three stars.  But no more than that.  A bad cast (Matthew Broderick is the biggest star they could get!?), average acting, and a plot \\"borrowed\\" from several other successful films, especially the King Kong ending.  Sure, the effects were great, because 95% of the budget went to them.  The plot is clearly secondary.  Even some of the worst Godzilla films (Godzilla'a Revenge, Godzilla vs. Megalon) have a more substantial plot than the Tristar Godzilla. The creature's build is biologically impossible: it is not nearly massive enough for its size and length.  However, there were a few saving graces.  The scene were \\"Godzilla\\" jumps into the Hudson river was cool, and the initial scenes remind me of the original Godzilla: King of the Monsters.  And Hank Azaria is actually not bad in the film.  The only good thing about the Tristar \\"Godzilla\\" film was that it was turned into a decent Saturday morning cartoon series.  Actually, many of those episodes were better than the big budget film.  All in all, an okay film, as long as you drop the title.
B0007O38F8|1.0|there was a time when even radio hip hop had a decent message and the artists had talent.  those days appear to be dead with a few exceptions.  unfortunately 50 cent is not one of these exceptions.  he is just another example of a rapper made famous by mtv and clear channel, tv and radio corporations run almost entirely by rich white people who know very little about actual music, which this is not.  If you are looking for REAL hip hop, the first thing you should do is turn off your radio and your tv.  Get your hands on some of the great old school and underground music that still exists and free your mind from this senseless BS and propaganda.  you won't be sorry and then you will realize how foolish you were to ever listen to this stuff.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Billy Wilder's the Apartment is a dark comedy about sex and ethics in the business world. In this Oscar-winning offbeat tale we find out that stepping up isn't so much fun when it's someone you care about that you're stepping on.<br /><br />In the apartment, the late Jack Lemmon plays C.C.Baxter, a guy trying to move up at his job. His trick is that he lets his managers use his Manhattan apartment to entertain their mistresses. He's the man to go to; a lot of executives want to use his place to. Even though Baxter would like to get some sleep, things are going smoothly so smoothly that he decided to make a copy of the key to his apartment so J.D. Sheldrake the director of HR can have exclusive use of his apartment. On the same day, C.C. tries to make a move on Fran Kublelick, an elevator operator. The same woman J.D Sheldrake the Director of Human Resources. is cheating with. C.C. enjoys his big promotion on the day of the Christmas party. However, on the night of the party he finds out how hollow his victory is when Fran tries to take her life because Sheldrake dumped her in his apartment. Realizing what he did to someone he cared about, C.C. Baxter really has to think about his arrangement over the course of a long weekend. I won't give away any more, the movie is too good to spoil. You have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />The late Billy Wilder knows how to write a story, even though the movie is almost 45 years old, the comments he makes about business and ethics are still relevant to 2005. Anyone coming out of college and going into the workworld needs to see this movie at least twice.<br /><br />The late Jack Lemmon is great here as C.C the employee struggling with his ethics and identity in the working world. He's one of the all time great actors; Every time I watch one of his movies I see a character telling a story and not him. It's a pleasure to watch him act. Shirley Maclaine gives one of her best performances here as Fran Kubelick. I really felt sorry for the character of Fran Kubelick because Maclaine made her so real. The late Fred McMurray and Ray Walston (the dad on My Three Sons and My Favorite Martian for you people who remember that far back) are amazing in this movie playing the exact polar opposites of the nice characters they play on TV. These two especially McMurray are so unethical you can feel the smarminess coming off them.<br /><br />The Apartment is an all around great movie and a Shawn James Five Star essential Video. You must buy this movie up and Wilder's equally hilarious Some Like it Hot. While you're at it pick up Office space and Clockwatchers. Compare and Contrast those two films to the Apartment. You'll find some interesting similarities in those three different workplace films.er of Fran Kubelick because Maclaine made her so real.

1559409010|5.0|Another great flick from the Pythons decked out with features. <br />The boys take a trip back to JC's era and look around to see things were as they are now, crazy! The movies says it all about organized anything, and how somthing so simple can get so misunderstood and basterdized until the reality of the situation bears no resemblance to the point that got it going in the first place. Like this Review, but seriously all the Guys deliver knock out performances and the themes add light and perspective to our current shape of having come so far and learned not so much.  Extra dual commentarys - documentary seal the deal a must see for anyone anywhere.
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely adored this movie, I am a huge Jane Austen fan and have read the book over and over.  This movie was true to the book while giving it new life with additional undercurrents and witty dialouge.  It helps that there are a few scenes showing off Colin Firth's hotness, but the actors' ability to portray their characters makes this movie awesome.  My roommate and I watched it at least four times in seven months.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|It's sad that Cher is at the end of her career. When you'll see her on this DVD, you'll see Cher as a sparkling and multi-talented diva. Her voice is so powerful and still beautiful. She starts her show with \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\". It's a U2 cover, she really sings it better than U2. And she talks between the songs. \\"Follow this you b*tches\\" is one of her famoust verdicts. Between all the costumechanges, there's always something on. I just love her costumes of \\"Take me Home\\" and \\"Strong enough\\". She looks so good in those outfits. The show ends with \\"Believe\\", her biggest hit. The extra's are really good. 3 extra performances and a behind-the-scene and a lot more. What can I say more than this: Cher rocks!! She's still one of the best. I hope she makes another CD or that she plans another tour. But this is \\"The Farewell Tour\\", this is really farewell I guess. It's worth your money, I promise.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Everybody's preaching about the REAL starwars and how it was ruined, but it's the same fuss that was made when it was retouched many years ago and those versions are still good. From what I saw, all that was changed was that one scene with Han and Greedo, which, I admit, used to be one of my favorite scenes, but it's nothing to hate these great movies over. These extremist reviewer types need to first, get a life, and second, get over it! I love the originals as much as the next guy--I grew up watching and loving these films, but now I say quit whining. My advice is to get these DVD's and appreciate them for there stories and don't get so worked up over one scene like the other nutter reviewers. Don't let them ruin your rightful cinematic experience because they can't get over a small change.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If the scale went from 1-10, I would give it an 11!  Simply the best WWII experience ever, period.  If you have any affliction to history, the military, or WWII, buy this now!!!  I read all the great reviews and had high expectations.  Once I got it, it surpassed all.
0790729628|4.0|This is of course an all-time classic film, but when you think about it, the plot is fundamentally flawed. The story concerns a policeman whose job is to identify and retire fugitive androids. These androids -- \\"replicants\\" -- are so like real humans that the only way to identify them is, basically, by asking them questions that would make most humans blush and measuring their physiological reactions with sophisticated electronic equipment. This is the so-called \\"Voight-Kampf test\\". This much Ridley Scott took from the original novel by Philip K. Dick. But then Scott made his replicants superhuman: they are much stronger than humans, and capable of withstanding extremes of heat and cold. When one of them is shot, she jerks spastically like a malfunctioning machine.<br /><br />Now, it stands to reason that a replicant who can casually plunge her hand into a flask of boiling water without being burned must be physiologically much different than a real human. Therefore, there must surely be easier and surer ways of identifying replicants than the complex 'Voight-Kampf' test.<br /><br />I've always assumed that Scott intended to make his audiences think about the similarities between the humans and the replicants, and the (im)morality of the former arbitrarily terminating the existences of the latter. But this story would have been much, much more powerful if the replicants were not superhuman but rather were indistinguishable from 'real' humans, so that when one of them is shot down in cold blood, we had only the results of the cop's dubious Voight-Kampf test to assure us that an escaped android has just been retired rather than a innocent woman been murdered. Instead, Scott has spared our consciences by providing the reassuring spectacle of Pris' robotic, mechanical, decidely inhuman death throes. We never have any doubt that these are artificially constructed robots and therefore we don't need to trouble ourselves much about the morality of killing them.
B00005JNEI|1.0|If the goal of a \\"documentary\\" is to convey a rational message, then this film fails.  If it is to convince others and bring them around to your own way of thought, then this film fails.  If the goal of such a film is to intelligently contribute to the debate/discussion at hand, then this film fails miserably. <br /> <br />It took me four tries to sit through this entire movie.  The first time, I left when Moore not only implied, but flat out stated that all Republicans and Conservitives (by which he means anybody who does not think exactly like he does) are racist and malicious.  It became abundantly clear that Moore was in no way interested in saying anything worth hearing.  Eventualy, however, through pure force of will, I managed to sit through the entire thing, much to my chargin.  The rest of the movie was, in my opinion, no better than the first few minutes. <br /> <br />To say that Moore plays fast and loose with the facts (as we have already seen him do with his many other films and books including his Academy Award Winning \\"Bowling for Columbine\\") is obvious and, most likely, besides the point: all documentaries do fudge the facts, if only a little bit.  They all of them present selected and carefully culled facts to emphasize the point they are trying to make and minimize legitimate criticism.  Moore, though, turns what is often a fine tool into a blunt instrument, clubbing viciously at opposing viewpoints and even more viciously at those that hold those viewpoints.  In fact, it seems that the target of Moore's ire is not the view, but the person, which is a major blow against his credibility as we can hear very distinctly the sound of Moore's very large axe being ground. <br /> <br />The hostile atmosphere and vague, often incorrect, \\"facts\\" of this film create the overal impression that Moore is doing nothing but preaching to an already shrill quire and, perhaps, attempting to affect national politics in his own, blunt and obvious way. <br /> <br />If you're looking for reinforcement of preconceived notions and a hearty pat on the back, this is a film for you.  If you're looking for intelligent debate, discussion, or contribution with subtle and interesting points, then you'd best look somewhere else.
B00000F169|4.0|My husband, his siblings, and a few friends and I all trooped down to the local theater to see this on opening day (which, as it turned out, was about the ONLY day it was shown in release).  We laughed till we made ourselves sick.<br /><br />OK, it was 1974.  Star Wars had not even been made yet.  And yes, the movie is now dated.  But the entire concept is still funny.  Seriously, how would you feel if you lost your ENTIRE supply of TP, had a crazed beach ball alien loose on your ship and one of your smart bombs decides to go into existential mode???<br /><br />See.  Over 30 years and I still remember the plot.  :-)  And hey, I'm buyin' the dvd to add to my collection.  It's worth the bucks, STILL.
B00004U8JV|4.0|Sequels as most anyone can tell you are tricky businesses. Either filmmakers try to repeat the success of the first one by just giving the same thing but on that \\"bigger and better\\" scale but it just doesn't have the magic as the first. Or you get into rare sequels like Terminator 2 and my favorite Aliens which surpass the original. Here, it's likable but then you find reasons to hate it. <br /> <br />Ian Malcolm has spent the last 4 years telling people who will listen the horrors that happened at Isla Nublar but no one will believe him, including when some big conglomerate bigwigs step in. He meets with Jurassic Park founder and former Ingen boss John Hammond who informs him of Site B, a kind of pre-breeding ground before being shipped to the park. But in order to not have Ingen take the dinosaurs away from the island, he sends a reluctant-but-then-determined Malcolm to the island, especially when news that his girlfriend Sarah is on the island alone. <br /> <br />So coming along with Malcolm is Nick, a photographer and Eddie, a field equipment expert and Malcolm's stowaway adopted daughter Kelly. Only they run into Ingen's team who wants to take the dinosaurs away back to the States. After a rather harrowing(and suspenseful) incident, they team up to try to escape the island, which then leads to dinosaur vs. city at the end. <br /> <br />Steven Spielberg when he does blockbuster films is best when it gets your heart pounding and gets the suspense going. The raptor in the kitchen scene or when T-Rex escapes are some of the better suspenseful moments from the first one. Oddly enough, there's 2 here. Inside a trailer that's being tipped over a cliff, Sarah falls but hits a sheet of glass which is steadily cracking. The other is when T-Rex pokes its head through a tent cause it smelled dried blood. But oddly enough they're just not that suspenseful as the first. <br /> <br />Another thing is that you start to question certain actions. Like when the trailer tips over,all of Ingen's men are there despite the fact 2 T-Rex's were just there. T-Rex's can't hear apparently? There's many others in the film but then you just forget about them afterwards. <br /> <br />In terms of CG it's still impressive. Unlike CG \\"father\\" George Lucas, Spielberg knows how to blend CG with live action unlike Lucas who goes really overboard with CG. Many of the dinosaur shots are actually big ass puppets. But then the next cut will be a CG and you wouldn't even notice the difference. It's more complex then the first but it doesn't have that \\"wow\\" factor. <br /> <br />One of Steven's lesser titles like Amistad or the Terminal but it's still entertaining in certain respects.
0805211063|5.0|We enter a world which is not the one we are in. We stand before the gates of the City ,and as we are about to enter, new walls intervene and remind us that all the distance we have traveled has taken us farther away from our goal. We look around us for familiar faces and when we see a smile, the smile suddenly turns to be the grotesque laughing of an enemy stranger.We think we are where we are but we are not anywhere where we can tell what this is.<br /><br />And through it all there is a haunting lure of darkness and distress, an atmosphere of Evil about to be done to us.<br /><br />No one can enter Kafka's world unless they read of the long chains of prison within himself , and which give themselves names as his world.<br /><br />The 'Castle ' is not a 'Castle' and the book is not a book.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie is probably one of the most popular movies of the year. I mean, I hadn't seen it and everyone else had seen it and was talking about it. Some loved, some hated it. But, most of the people I knew seemed to enjoy it. So, when I was over at a friend's house and saw a copy of it, I decided to watch it. He had really enjoyed it and I... <br />Well, first off, let me say that Jon Heder did a great job as Napoleon. I mean, this was the biggest nerd in the world. With his red hair, big glasses, big boots and stupid remarks.  <br />He's Napoleon, a nerd in Idaho who lives with his crazy grandma, old and pathethic brother and then his insane oncle Rico. Napoleon gets bullied around, isn't popular at all and only has 2 friends: Deb and Pedro. They are both also neat characters. The movie is often very interesting to watch and really fun. At other times, it seems really stupid and pointless. But, in the end, it was great fun and quite funny actually. Napoleon delivers laughs but I thought that ucle Rico was by far the funniest. He delivered loads of laughs. He is a pathethic man obssessed with eating steaks who thinks that he is the best football player in the world. Even though he isn't at all. Pedro is also very funny as are his mean and tough cousins. The movie has some quite hilarious moments that you'll remember forever. From uncle Rico's behavior, to Napoleon's boots and glasses, to everything else. It's just great. Also, Napoleon's brother is quite funny as is his girlfriend La Phonda. It's a really hilarious movie and I don't want to give away any of the jokes so that you can discover them on your own. I strongly recommend renting this stupid but really funny and interesting movie.
B000003B6J|5.0|This might not have been the very first Gangsta Rap album, but with the rage in Ice Cube's voice and the premium production of Dr. Dre this is the album that set the stage for mainstream Gangsta Rap even without the help of radio or MTV.  An acronym for Niggaz With Attitude these guys packed all of the attitude of Compton into this disc.  With MC Ren and Ice Cube spitting in your face street lyrics like a p***ed off Chuck D anyone who heard this couldn't dodge the impact of the subject matter.  \\"F*** The Police\\", which of course warranted the imfamous letter from the F.B.I., was a dose of shocking realism at the time as was the rest of the album.  Eazy E adds the Flavor Flav quasi-comic relief making this an all around entertaining album.  DJ Yella assists Dre with the beats coming together with Bomb Squad's hardcore sonic influences and adding some West Coast flavor to them.  As noted at the beginning of this review N.W.A. were not the first Gangsta Rappers, but as is often the case in music it's the ones who perfect the genre that get the recognition rather than the innovators.  And perfect Gangsta Rap is exactly what N.W.A. does with STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON.
0767817664|4.0|I agree with other people when they say \\"The best vampire movie.\\" It was well done, even though it's just a movie it seems so convincing. I liked all the actors in Fright Night, I think all of them played there parts really good. I recommend this movie to anyone who's into scary, but not gorry movies. It would be a perfect movie to watch around Halloween with some friends.
B0000UJL96|5.0|There's an inside \\"Trek\\" joke that claims that all the even numbered original crew movies are great and all the odd numbered ones are bad.  Very True.  The Undiscovered Country is number 6 and fabulous.  What a way to end the original crew's career together.  Great, Great, Great.  The dialog is wonderful, acting is wonderful ... another outstanding original from the original cast!  Worth every penny.
B0000942LT|5.0|Right after created a great cd like \\"Break the Cycle\\" they go and make another awesome cd called \\"14 Shades of Grey.\\"  I thought this cd kicked a**. The lyrics and beat are incredible. Some of the songs I would reccomend are PRICE TO PLAY, HOW ABOUT YOU, and SO FAR AWAY. If you don't believe me, I believe you can listen to some of the tracks on the main page for 14 shades of grey. Check out some of the tracks I listed and I'M SURE YOU\\"LL LOVE STAIND'S MUSIC!!!!
055357342X|4.0|I havereally enjoyed the book and am not so patiently waiting for the next.My only real complaint is the deaths.Yes I know there to keep the story \\"realistic\\" but not many of the characters who deserve it the most have died yet (The Freys for example). And three books into the series every time I think I know whats going on I find some other lord is or might be plotting to do this or the other. Prayerfully someone will finally whack Bolton and Cersie in book for. I'm also not sure who to cheer for any more the starks or daenareys, though she seems to be doing fine on her own. If you haven't read books one and two wait or you'll be really lost. If you have read book one and two then you need to hurry up and buy three. This is one of the best series i have read in a while and I can't wait for the next installments.
0765310015|2.0|This book has more plot threads than a Tom Clancy novel.  Every one of them is difficult to understand.  It's hard to relate to the characters because every time you think you are getting to know the setting and characters, the book switches to something completely different. <br /> <br />I knew when I started that there were going to be a lot of characters, and based on all the positive reviews here, I really tried to keep going.  When I had almost gotten used to what was going on, yet another change of scene and a whole new set of characters was thrown at me.  Talk about alienating your readers!  I finally had to give up.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|OK, I don't usually take time to respond to other reviews, but I think this is an instance where it warrants it.  For the people that have given this album 1.5 stars, 2 stars or anything less than 4 stars, lets try to determine how you actaully rate the music you listen to!  You have to think about DT and all of the great albums that they have put out in the 15+ years of their existence.  Then you have to compare these albums with the music that was (is) out at the current time.  For example, Images & Words could come out in 1992, 2005 or 2025 and it will stand as one the great all time albums.  Let's shift forward to Octavarium.  Sure, there are some commercial elements to this album and perhaps they have borrowed some sounds from other bands.  But, what are you rating this album against?  To give it 1.5 stars is ludicrous!  If you are rating this album agains other DT albums then that is one thing. But, if you are giving it 1.5 stars agaings other releases from other bands, then  you obvioulsy do not appreciate music.  By the way, to the reviewer who said that \\"DT has been going downhill since TOT\\", this makes no sense as Octavarium is the only other release since TOT!  How can you make such an uninformed, uneducated judgement of a band's performance from one album to the next?   <br /> <br />My 2 cents.  Listen to the album and don't write a review until you have listened to the album at least 10 times cover to cover.  Trust me, there is alot of stuff here as with all DT releases.  I'll be the first to admit, when I heard \\"I walk beside you\\" I was a little frightened.  But, it has not left my CD player and am liking it more each day.  Sure it may bot be on par with Awake, at least for me, but compared to most everything else on the planet, it is superior.
B000000WA4|1.0|Pretentious title for an album, but at least \\"1979\\" was a decent radio tune, even if one still had to endure Billy Pumpkin's whiny, nasal voice. There does exist an instrumental version of it. I haven't heard it, but would like to. I read somewhere that Billy Pumpkinhead and his pumpkin patch didn't even perform this song in concert at the time. What kind of pumpkinhead is he, not doing the current hit? If I were a fan I would have thrown pumpkin shells at him for that insult.
B00003CXXP|2.0|Global warming for breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnite snacks enough already!  People shouldn't be brainwashed into thinking what the director/actors think that's called being a nazi.  Just because you have the money and resources to manipulate people dosen't make it right. Everyone should have a basic right to be able to think for themselves (free will) remember? Anyway, the one star is for Jude and the other is for Haley. This was a very good idea but Steven turned it into a sap-fest as usual
0609610570|4.0|Based on the backgrounds of the author's and the fact that they have brought promising results and accomplishments to their companies makes this a good book to read to gain insight on successful execution. The author's define 3 building blocks of successful execution and 3 core processes for proper execution.  The common themes are the leader's involvement, the right people, and the proper use of communication.  They demonstrate these through a series of examples from big name companies such as Xerox, Ford, Chrysler, and Lucent.  There is a lot that can be learned from this book as many people take the act of execution within a company for granted and focus too much on the numbers, rather than linking actions with strategy.  The book is written in very general terms in which one can mold the process to fit their needs.  Overall, it was an interesting book and is highly recommended to anyone wishing to better understand the discipline of execution. <br /> <br /> <br />

This kind of movie (like the most recent so called blockbuster movies including Star War movies) the special effects or CGI generated effects are the real stars.  I just wonder why the movie stars keep getting  bigger and bigger paychecks when the special effects do all the work for them? It's either the movie really has no plot so lets make it as confusing as possible or throw in so much CGI so it \\"looks\\" really spectacular and really noisy.  Hollywood is dead.
0783226888|4.0|Michael Caton-Jones is one of those directors who never makes a really good movie, but usually there's something interesting about them.  Actors must love him because he's certainly lured a lot of the best into his productions.  Maybe that's his weakness, a penchant for big names and not really being able to offer them proper vehicles for their talents.  They wind up overacting, out of control.  DOC HOLLYWOOD is a good example.  Cute premise, appealing stars, and what happens?  Caton-Jones fails to lift it out of routine romantic comedy.  He had an attractive cast, and a fantastic soundtrack, in SCANDAL, the 1989 film of the Profumo/Christine Keeler affair, but it just sat there and failed to give off sparks.  MEMPHIS BELLE was more of the same, a war picture that did not revive the war picture as it was meant to.  ROB ROY was an aimitation of BRAVEHEART and CITY BY THE SEA--well, what the devil was that anyhow?  Caton-Jones had a real success with THIS BOY'S LIFE, in which he uncovered layers of talent in the young Leo DiCaprio, but one is not surprised he is now directing the BASIC INSTINCT sequel RISK ADDICTION.  I bet it's a pip.<br /><br />However, THE JACKAL isn't half bad and in some ways it might be the best of the bunch.  Again the enormous cast of talented actors, among them the amazing Diane Venora (of Michael Mann fame) here going all Russian and Ninotchka is some wonderful outfits and the frosty, wet look of one torn between allegiances.  Sidney Poitier is in it too, sort of a waste of Poitier's once great talent.  Really anybody could have played the part.  Richard Gere strikes all the right notes and plays an IRA terrorist, Declan, with a heart of gold and smart as all get out, who helps the USA solve the problem of who will the Mafia send to kill the first lady.  (I know, what a ridiculous story, and in such bad taste in our age of terror.)  Still Gere is terrific and makes all the right deductions and eventually we begin to realize that none other than Bruce Willis is really evil Carlos, the original Jackal, the hit man beyond compare.<br /><br />When one compares this film to the original, Apollonian classic made by Fred Zinnemann in the 1970s, one realizes that perhaps they changed De Gaulle to the First Lady because focus groups were employed to find out that nowadays no one knows who De Gaulle was, and presumably everyone knows the First Lady.  How stupid!  For \\"First Lady\\" Tess Harper, once an important actress in US cinema, this was her last movie of the 1990s, and in fact her final studio picture (since then she has appeared in one obscure indie after another.  And yet THE JACKAL is an appealing mess of a film, everything but the kitchen sink makes an appearance, and then, around reel eight, there's a kitchen sink!  You've got to love it.than Bruce Willis is really evil Carlos, the original Jackal, the hit man beyond compare. <br /> <br />When one compares this film to the original, Apollonian classic made by Fred Zinnemann in the 1970s, one realizes that perhaps they changed De Gaulle to the First Lady because focus groups were employed to find out that nowadays no one knows who De Gaulle was, and presumably everyone knows the First Lady.

6304712499|2.0|John is such a versatile actor you'd he would be doing more movies.  He has the same range of talent that Johnny Depp has,but where Depp has delicate and androgonus features, John is rougher around the edges but their talent is so obvious. John stole this movie, the CGI wasen't up to snuff, but I think most of these types of movie rely to much on that and don't let the characters do the acting or tell the story. I enjoyed it.
0312323859|5.0|I only say \\"surprisingly\\" because I was initially wary of reading a novel based soley on a character you quickly learn to dislike in \\"Something Borrowed.\\" A whole book about Darcy didn't initially grab my attention, but like others...I felt obligated to read her side of the story after spending so much time with the characters in the first novel. Plus I love Emily Giffin's writing style, so this book was hard to resist. I absolutely loved the sequel and I found myself really taking a liking to Darcy, especially in the second half of the book. Everything was wrapped up so perfectly at the end (it even made me cry!) that I don't know if I would want a continuation of the story. It was perfect! Read it. :)
B000667FN8|5.0|I really like this cd, I think this one is way better than their first cd. They just sound more older in this one.
B000002OX3|2.0|I really can't understand how a person can't include the title track. Well not exactly the title track, but when it was first released the album in the U.S. they changed the album title from A Quick One to Happy Jack. But anyways, it's outrageous not to include the original recording of Happy Jack. It's like not including Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water on the album Bridge Over Troubled Water. It's like not including Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' on the album The Times They Are A-Changin'. It's like not including the Beatle's Magical Mystery Tour on the album Magical Mystery Tour. I think I made my point. It's a shame. I suggest downloading the tracks that were on the original album from iTunes to make your own A Quick One/Happy Jack.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is an unbelievable CD. From beginning to end, it is loaded with great songs (we won't count Cure for the Itch.)The music on the CD is great, Linkin Park has some great guitar segments. The songs themselves are spectacular in every aspect. The lyrics are great to listen to, the vocals are perfect, and the music has already been covered. The vocals including switches between singing and rapping, which keep the album fresh and make it impossible to be repetitive. Overall, it is a great album, so I recommened to buy it.  <br /> <br />1. Papercut - The best opening track I've heard in a long time. Great lyrics, guitars, pace. Just draws you in and makes you want to listen to more of the CD. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. One Step Closer - A short, fast-paced song that is one of Linkin Park's finest. The lyrics are a bit thin, but the way that they are performed makes up for it. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. With You - A unique track on the CD. A slower song, but still has rap. Sound pretty good, but some parts are out of place. 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Points of Authority - Title makes no sense, but it's still a great song. Love the chorus, with multiple layered vocals. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Crawling - Another slow one, but almost all singing (except a line or two.) Silent and creepy, yet great. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Runaway - Fast-paced, loud song that has my favorite Linkin Park melody (the opening 30 seconds rock) and the best lyrics. Perfect. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. By Myself - A loud to quiet contrast that is great. Chester's screaming chorus is awesome. Once again, a great melody. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. In the End - For most, this is the only Linkin Park song they know. There's a reason for that. It's the best song on the album. Best performed song in terms of vocals and it just sounds perfect. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. A Place for My Head - Another great song. My second favorite melody, and once again, the opening 30 seconds rock. The rap verses are also Linkin Park's finest, and the chorus is just great. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Forgotten - A very fast-paced song with a lot of Mike Shinoda and a little Chester. Chester's pieces are the best, but are few and far. Lyrics are good though. 8/10 <br /> <br />11. Cure for the Itch - Usless and strange. Not needed at all. Ruins the album's perfect score. Downloaders, skip this one.  <br /> <br />12. Pushing Me Away - Another slower song with mostly singing. Great lyrics, well sung. 10/10 <br /> <br />Overall score: 9/10 Cure for the Itch is just that awful that it drops it a whole point.
B00004SA86|5.0|OK, you're just perhaps getting into Mahler or exploring a bit and you want some good recommendations. What you encounter on any given recording is rave reviews and trash reviews, all over the map, as they say.    Well, here's the terrible truth--and the Mahler fans'll be all over me on this one; punching furiously at \\"not helpful\\" in hopes of racking up a high score.    a) Although Mahler lived and composed around the turn of the last century his music didn't really catch on until the LP era. Yup, he's largely a stereo and music collector phenomenon. What happened is that with few exceptions there really wasn't even the beginnings of a solid critical assessment or performing tradition until--jeepers--the 1960s--50 years after the guy dropped dead. That's when people started to get an idea of what he was about, and plenty of conductors, like Bernstein, laid on their own very personal interpretations, tried to \\"own him\\" in sense. Not so oddly, everyone's Mahler came out sounding differently. Bernstein's Mahler sounded like Bernstein wrote it, Karajan's Mahler sounded like Richard Strauss wrote it, and Solti's Mahler sounded like Beethoven wrote it. Honestly, I don't think anyone was really all that sure about what it was supposed to sound like. Bruno Walter may have been the only conductor to truly own him, as he was Mahler's assistant, so his recordings are a good place to start and possibly a good standard to use. Unfortunately, I don't believe he recorded them all.    b)Responses to various performances seem to reflect different individual's personal relationships with various conductors more than anything. If you don't like George Solti you aren't going to like his Mahler no matter what and boyo that's for sure.    c)Mahler gave too detailed perfomance instructions on his scores which seem to confuse people more than anything. Gilbert Kaplan--some banker or something--is an amateur who took conducting lessons and became an expert on every tiny facet of Mahler's Second Symphony. Some find his recordings of it stunning. Maybe they are, but they sound too stunning for me, like the gal too beautiful to ask out. I like my Mahler down closer to me thanks very much which means I like performances that don't shine to Mahler's OCD. I seriously doubt even Mahler conducted the same piece precisely the same way twice, giving lie to his own presumptions on this matter. If I'm wrong that was quite an achievement on Mahler's part. Anyway, all that instruction makes for a confusing experience for a conductor who may \\"feel\\" the piece slightly differently and that creates a sort of performance cognitive disssonance--a tug of war of intentions--that often shows in many recordings.    d) Mahler was great, but inconsistent, and even today there's little consensus on when he was great or not so great. None of his music, interpreted by anyone, seems to leave a listener with the sense of wholeness and completion than one gets from, say, a mature work by Bach, Beethoven, or, above all, Mozart. You'll see endless rave reviews about how this or that conductor and orchestra finally makes this or that work hang together as a whole--not a good sign. What this tells me is that there may be no \\"perfect\\" Mahler performance (That's \\"NOT HELPFUL\\" over there on the right, just use the mouse and click) because there is no perfect Mahler symphony. (No, my email address is not included in my profile so don't bother checking, and I live in Greenland anyway, so put down the rope). My sense has always been that with the really big works, the ones describing the totality of the universe, the sum of all fears, infinity, nebular clusters, God, and so on, meaning nearly all of them, the man was just possibly overreaching a hair. His stuff's absolutely worth listening to but, at times, if you leave it feeling like you've just been lectured about your immortal soul by some wild-eyed guy with crazy hair don't be too concerned. If Mozart had ever met Mahler after hearing his music he would have shot him and gone to the electric chair believing he'd killed the Anti-Christ.    e) Because so much of Mahler is about death and resurrection or almost, his ardent fans tend to share the same, shall we say, metaphysical zeal, and frequently express it in periodic cat fights over the mystical significance and portentiousness of this or that work and other trivialities. Ardent Mahler fans are the last people to listen to (Forget it, no detective agency in the world can track me down!) for Mahler recommendations. It would be like walking into a cult and religion fair, walking up to the first booth (Mormons or Rastafarians maybe?) and politely asking the booth attendants which of these many fine religions represented here at the fair would they recommend? Before you know it you'd be sucked into a raging maelstrom, a black hole, never to be heard from again. You'll be listening to Boulez's Mahler with a pistol in hand and an eye on the door, or Bernstein, on a Walkman, in agony at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Life will never again contain a moment of happiness. You are trapped in Mahlerland, where every moment is pure Hell.    I recommend this set of Mahler's symphonies because Kubelik, more than anyone perhaps, plays the music well and wth feeling and atmosphere and makes Mahler's alternately hysterical and demanding ghost go cool his heels in the Green Room. His interpretations are less about Mahler and more about the music on the page. That's certainly why some don't like these recordings. When I want to rant, rave and then go foetal, I listen to Bernstein's Mahler because Lennie feels my pain; when I want my angst with elegance it's Karajan all the way, if I'm in Beatnik hep-cat mode I go with Boulez--\\"Ah, yes, emotion. Cool Daddy-o!\\" If I want a taste of old Vienna circa 1905 it's Bruno Walter. Basically go out and have fun with this often amazing music, meaning don't be a typical Mahler fan and don't be like Mahler--the un-fun-est composerwho ever lived. Hopefully you'll end up with good entertaining handfuls of each major work and you'll be blissfully ignorant of which ones are the \\"right\\" ones.
B00003CXCT|3.0|For the release of this trilogy, George Lucas kept saying the movies were his and that he could whatever he wanted to them if he liked to. Well, he was not just saying it!<br /><br />Long before the release of this set, rumor had it that while filming the new episodes he was also shooting new scenes for the classic trilogy, someone even wrote that he asked John Williams to re-score episode IV so the `Imperial March' would be present in the whole saga.<br /><br />It's not that I don't agree with directors altering their films (look at the extended editions of `The lord of the rings') the problem here I believe is that these movies are classics, and for generations people have fallen in love with them, so watching a movie that reminds you of your childhood when puppets were the best thing special effects could offer and suddenly seeing a digital version of Jabba the Hutt talking to Han Solo can be shocking. The whole issue these changes represented could have been avoided with a very simple thing: an option. Something similar to what many directors have done for their DVD's: if you want to see the original theatrical release click here, for an extended edition click over there, that simple!<br /><br />The truth is Lucas film didn't think that way and they just went ahead and changed everything Lucas asked (some of the changes are hilarious really, wait to see Hayden Christensen in episode VI), below you'll find some of the changes made to this `Special edition' of the `Theatrical special edition' from 1997, it is up to you to decide if you buy it, I rather borrow them from someone and wait for the release of the original cut (I don't doubt they will release it, Lucas will never have enough money):<br /><br />* A new digital Jabba the Hutt in Episode IV. No, this is not the digital Jabba from 1997, the scene might be the same but yeah, this is a new Jabba (for Christ sake, wasn't Lucas happy with the one he added before?)<br /><br />* A new Emperor in Episode V. Remember the old emperor from the `Empire strikes back'? forget about him, Ian Mc Diarmind is here now! Not only was he added to an existing scene but the dialogue was modified as well, now Palpatine is kind enough to explain to us that ` the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker'<br /><br />* Boba Fett's voice changed! I know, it sounds ridiculous but it's true. Following the twisted logic in Lucas' mind, he thought `Well, if Bobba is a clone from Jango Fett, they must have the same voice!' Genious! Now we have the classic dialogues from the bounty hunter we love, with an accent (wasn't it enough to make of a legendary bounty hunter a spoiled boy?)<br /><br />* Darth Vader has no eyebrows anymore in Episode VI. I'm not teasing, check it out when Luke takes off Vader's mask near the end of the movie, the excuse is `now he looks more resembling of Hayden Christiansen'<br /><br />* Jedi Temple and Naboo in Episode VI. In the final celebration of the film, among the planets that were added in 1997 now we have Naboo (and Jar Jar Binks in the middle of the screen screaming: `Wesa free') and in Coruscant now we get to see the Jedi Temple in the distance.<br /><br />* Anakin Skywalker in Episode VI. Yes, we still have old Anakin's spectre next to Yoda and Ben Kenobi, the only difference is that the old Anakin is gone and now we have Hayden Christensen! Why? Because according to Lucas' commentary, when Anakin transformed into Darth Vader he died, so the old guy we see dying is not Anakin but Vader (what?) it makes sense according to him that we see the younger version when he died as Anakin.<br /><br />A very important thing to note would be that the sound mixing is awful, this can be specially noticed in Episode IV, the dialogues sometimes sound clear and some other times don't, they switch from stereo to mono and it is just too difficult to let it pass unnoticed if you have a home theater sound.<br /><br />The extras are good enough to spend some time watching them, being `Empire of dreams' the highlight of the DVD. The documentaries are more of an `everybody admires Lucas' thing; funny fact is that Peter Jackson is present in most of the documentaries and in all his appearances he says how much he admires Lucas' work. No matter how disappointing this can result, even the ones who hated it like me will end up buying it if they haven't already, after all, that's what makes us fans, isn't it?e watching them, being `Empire of dreams' the highlight of the DVD.

B00003RQNJ|4.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of those critic-proof movies.  Every critic hated it at the time it was released - Pauline Kael wrote an especially nasty one.  Yet it was a tremendous hit at the box office and has since gone on to become a sort of classic.  (Obviously, Robert Redford names his film festival after it). <br /> <br />It tells the partly true story of two outlaws in the Old West.  They are pretty successful until the owner of the railroad they keep robbing hires a \\"superposse\\" to hunt them down.  They decide to flee to Bolivia and take up robbery there. <br /> <br />I think that, if the movie had been released now, it would have received favorable reviews.  Paul Newman and Robert Redford are a great pair for buddy movies.  There is lots of clever dialogue.  The problem is that the film derails half-way through with a 27-minute long chase sequence that tends to drag on the re-viewing.  Still, it's entertaining enough. <br /> <br />I don't know if there are enough extras on this DVD to be considered a \\"Special Edition.\\"  They mainly consist of interviews with the cast and crew from 1994. <br />
0688156819|5.0|`The melancholy death of oyster boy & other stories' is a compilatory book of 23 poems written by director Tim Burton (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow)<br /><br />All the poems are beautifully accompanied by original illustrations drawn by Burton, the perfect complement for the stories he tells throughout the book. The book is also presented in a Postscript version of Scripps College Oldstyle, a very interesting notation on the last pages.<br /><br />The peculiarity of all the characters in this book is what makes them so compelling, the poems are filled with a very dark humor, irony and beautiful metaphors (there is the story of `Voodoo girl', a girl with pins around her heart, so no one can get close to her or she will be hurt) All the characters are outcasts, characters so unique that it is very difficult for them to fit in and be loved, but even though they're different, the situations can somehow relate to real life. Once you read this book it is very easy to understand the origins of `Edward Scissorhands', a guy with scissors instead of hands who couldn't possible hug or have physical contact with anyone. The last poem of the book is the perfect ending for this incredible compilation of bizarre tales on the lives of even more bizarre but lovable characters.<br /><br />An excellent book for all ages, the poems are quite rhythmic and simple, I have bought a couple of copies to give to some of my friends and I haven't met a single person who has read it and didn't like it. The poem that gives title to the book is just unbelievable and the best poem of the book; how love can lead to cruelty and the melancholic fate of poor oyster boy will leave you with a sensation of sadness.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the works of Burton in the movies and specially liked `Edward Scissorhands' you are going to fall in love with this book.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This film is truly a masterpiece. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were great and delivered perfect performances. Andy is sent to prison for life, and thus begins his journey which is an uphill struggle all the way. It's a very moving film, told from the perspective of Red, another convicted murderer and Andy's best friend, whose first impression of Andy is that a stiff breeze would blow him over. As time progresses though, Andy's values of hope have an impact on Red who develops a better understanding and different perspective on things. When I first saw it, I was overwhelmed. It should have done way better in the oscars. This is one of the best films I have ever seen and would strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. I've seen it at least 400 bajillion times (much thanks to TNT) but wouldn't hesitate to pop in the DVD and watch it again if prompted. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) are great. They play truly believable parts. Andy, Red, and the rest of the prison crew are people that you grow to like at an early point in the movie and you really hope that things turn out okay for them. When a filmmaker makes you really feel for the characters he's done his job. It appeals to every type of movie, it's suspenseful, it's funny, it's even romantic (in a friendship sort of way), it's just a great drama. The poor guy goes through so much just to get his freedom and to be right. You have to see it to believe it.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|First of all and as it is announced on the cover of the DVD, this movie comes directly from the creators of `South Park'. So you can expect to see in this movie the same humor and irreverent jokes that gave fame to the show. The idea for this movie came up as a way to make fun of the Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which everything is action and we get to see things exploding all the time, and in the most crucial moments of the film, action is interrupted with a sentimental thing; well, all those things are here and believe me, you'll never see a Jerry Bruckheimer film the same ever again (if you get Parker and Stone's sense of humor) The idea of using puppets came from the creator's hate to actors, something they explain in the additional documentaries on this DVD.<br /><br />The story opens with Team America saving France from a terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction, one the members dies and it is time for them to find a replacement: an actor (wait till you listen to the reason, hilarious)<br /><br />From the very beginning the movie surprises with the level of detail of the scenarios and the characters, the production is unbelievable. Also we get to see that behind all the fart jokes and the simplest humor, there is always a sharp critique to the so called `American way'. Team America decides what's best for the world, even if that implies destroying every place they visit. Also the `Film Actors Guild' takes its share of critique, actors trying to pose as figures of influence are not an invention of these guys (Matt Damon is simply one of the funniest characters in this film); Michael Moore is also present in a fatal moment for the team. But the most interesting thing is to see Kim Jong Il portrayed as the villain (the song he sings is one of the most memorable moments of the movie); it is told that he is an avid movie collector, it would be interesting to know if he owns this movie and his opinion about it, but hey, these are the same guys that gave Jesus Christ a TV show! Can we expect them to respect someone? I don't think so.<br /><br />The musicals are present (even Broadway appears on the movie), the way the use the dramatic music is amazing (check it out when Gary vomits) and makes these moments even funnier, the dialogues are crazy (the foreign characters don't talk a thing and instead say things like `Ping pong' or `Derka derka muhamed ali') and the voices are as funny as the ones in South Park (most of them performed by Trey and Matt)<br /><br />The awkwardness of the puppets is the best humor resource used in this film, the way the puppets walk is way too funny (and this is done intentionally), the characters pointing at things and then missing, the `help signal' Gary has to make when he is in danger, all of those are quite simple things that will make you laugh it up.<br /><br />The movie is presented with English 5.1 surround, English and French 2.0, subtitles in English and Spanish. The documentaries included in relation with the making of the movie complement perfectly and explain the reasons behind the making of this movie and the whole creative process. The uncensored edition has a couple of scenes added to the sex sequence between the puppets, somehow resembling of the video of Cartman's mom in `South Park the movie'<br /><br />Bottom-line, a very interesting film in the way in which it was produced and a hilarious piece of comedy.Jesus Christ a TV show!

6305311463|1.0|I really did not like this film. Something supernatural like this happening is not totally un-likely, but the chances are quite slim. Most of this movie was situated tightly on the romance Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck had. The two \\"love-birds\\" turned this movie into a semi-chick flick movement, when in reality an enormous comet was supposed to wipe out the earth. Michael Bay truly disappoints with this film. His directing style is poor, as he literally believes that an edit every second is the best way to make a film. I don't think it's possible to physically count the number of cuts and explosions in his films within one human lifetime. The guy can't even make a decent movie with the insane budget he gets to work with. Honestly guys, stick to what's worth seeing, which isn't this movie.
0765309408|5.0|A reviewer could reasonably debate whether this book is too derivative of Heinlein, but not whether it is an entertaining SF novel in the Heinlein tradition.  If you dislike Heinlein's style, do not read this book.  If you enjoy Heinlein, and particularly Starship Troopers and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, you will enjoy this book--which is Heinlein brought to 2005 more thoughtful and balanced sensibilities.  I thought it was an enjoyable and action-filled but also quite thoughtful novel (about the nature of both aging and warfare), and an SF fan to whom I loaned it enjoyed it as well. (I'm a conservative Republican and he's a liberal Democrat, by the way...) <br /> <br />Samuel Baylus provides absolutely no support for his damning review, which negates any scintilla of credibility it may otherwise have had.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is one of the rare films I could watch over and over. It's definitely one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Russell Crowe is captivating. The acting was excellent, the scenes were superb, and the history of the times enlightening. The story was compelling. The action as well as the dynamics of the characters were beautifully combined to make this a classic. I enjoyed everything about this movie.
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's 1983 album Pyromania sent Def Leppard on the road to much success in the United States but not so much success in the U.K. However, it would take the band almost 4 1/2 years to get back on their feet after being struck with such a disaster that would bring any band to their knees. Rick Allen on New Year's Eve was caught in an automobile accident that completely totaled his 1984 Chevy Corvette Sting Ray and sent him flying through the windshield as it completely severed his left arm. Now, before I get into the rest of this accident, Rick Allen joined Def Leppard when he was only 15 in 1978 and before the accident was a very accomplished, skilled, and determined drummer with no fear in his eyes. However, after losing his left arm after doctors tried to reattached it but it got infected and had to be removed for good, he either had to leave the band or find a way to suck it up with no idea of how to continue. And thats what he did and he did it even better than ever before as lead singer Joe Elliot would say that Rick is a better drummer now then he ever was before. In my eyes Rick Allen is THE greatest drummer in the world! You can take Neil Peart, John Bonham, Ginger Baker, Keith Moon, Alex Van Halen, and who ever else and they dont compare in my eyes to the one- armed bandit of Rick Allen. I mean how many drummers do you know can lose their arm and come back to be a better then they were before. Just hearing from that concert video when Rick Allen returned as Joe Elliot said 'I want to you to meet my mate Rick Allen' and the crowd went absolutely nuts. As the crowd was cheering on louder and louder Rick Allen just sat behind his custom made drum set bursting in tears. Rick Allen's recovery was a brutal year long struggle that left him with five fingers, ten toes, and the passion and determination to move on from one of the most disasterous events in any drummer's life as Rick found his place in my book as being the greatest drummer in the world.  <br /> <br />P.S: Do I have to get into the songs? (There all GREAT minus Dont Shoot Shotgun and Excitable.)  <br /> <br />Def Leppard kicks major @$$!!!
B00000F1D3|3.0|Cher-Believe<br /><br />Year: 1998<br /><br />Record Label: Warner Bros<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />01. believe<br /><br />02. the power<br /><br />03. runaway<br /><br />04. al or nothing<br /><br />05. strong enough<br /><br />06. Dov `E L'Amore<br /><br />07. Takin back my heart<br /><br />08. Taxi taxi<br /><br />09. Love is the groove<br /><br />10. We all sleep alone<br /><br />It's been a long time since Cher released an album, and this comeback album works beautifully for her. Well aware of the changing times, and the different genres of music that are popular today, Cher has released an album filled with throbbing dance beats.<br /><br />Most people may ask dance music and Cher? But this actually works. In a sense it actually seems like Cher has gone back into a time of the seventies, and her songs evoke the image of disco balls, sequined miniskirts, and writhing bodies.<br /><br />Like all Cher's albums the lyrics are strong, the beat is catchy and well suited for this time.<br /><br />Believe is the first song off the album, and was a hit when it first came out with its hypnotic dance beats.<br /><br />Not only is there a dance theme to this album but latin music has been infringed into the whole album with songs like \\"The Power\\" and \\"Dov'e L'Amore\\" both interlaced with latin beats.<br /><br />There are some weak tracks on this album, such as \\"taxi, taxi\\", which, just basically gets on someone's nerves. It also takes a little while to get used to the remix of we all sleep alone.<br /><br />The outstanding tracks though are Believe, The Power, strong enough, and all or nothing.<br /><br />Cher's attempt to position herself in the dance genre has worked beautifully, and it is definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />Her vocals are as strong as ever, and while the genre of music has changed from pop to dance, her songs are still as well written, and it is still the same Cher only updated for our times.<br /><br />I give this 3/5
B000066F6H|5.0|I thought this album was better then there most recent album and there last if your just looking into the Hives buy this CD first then there most recent Tyrannosaurus Hives if you love em but this a great CD for any rock lover.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I have watched many great movies in my time(and a good deal more bad ones) but not even the greatest of them celebrates the human spirit in such a simple and powerful way as Shawshank Redemption does. And it is also based one the novella (which can be found in different seasons) by one of the all-time great authors Stephen King.  It tells the story of a man named Andy Dufresne who is sent to prison for the murder of his wife, (which at that time you are not sure if he did it or not)  When he first arrives at Shawshank Prison, he meets a man named \\"Red\\" Redding who can \\"locate certain things from time to time\\" They hit it off, and over time become close friends. Over time, different amusing and sad things happen, and you learn just how deep Andy's reservoir of willpower and courage is. (Not to mention extremely smart). Perhaps its best to let the viewer find out about everything that goes on in the film, but in the end, the movies message-fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free--is so simply brilliant that it somehow put s it one up over every other movie out there.  It didn't do too well in theatres, but it did pretty good with dvd sales and such.  I have a feeling that this is one movie that will remain in peoples hearts for a very long time.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This CD if the White Stripes 4th CD and one there best CD's next to White Blood Cells in my opinion. Buy this CD if your just looking into the White Stripes then look  into White Blood Cells a great CD to add to any collection. The White Stripes are just good and for me the duo thing just makes them better. We need more bands like this.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I believe that this is one of my favorite Disney movies. Maybe what I like so much is that Mulan is not waiting for her prince to come or any damsel in distress deal, but she is an intelligent woman held down by her society. The story: Mulan's father is old but he is called to war. He will probably die. Mulan decides to take his place. This is remarkably unselfish because if she's discovered she will be killed. This shows how much she loves her dear old dad. You just have to see the movie to appreciate it. The songs are amazing (\\"I'll make a man out of you\\" Donny Osmond's voice is fantastic). The extra features were also pretty good. I found \\"I'll make a man out of you\\" in all different languages very interesting. The animation is great as it shows a lot of the natural beauty of China. So make sure you don't miss one of Disney's greatest(and probably last judging by the way Disney is going down the drain) animated movies.
B000000W5H|3.0|One of Mick Taylor's finest musical moments is TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE. But it's also the occasion for Mick Jagger's worst vocal moment. First he sings: \\"Time can tear down a building.\\" Then he switches into his cockney-redneck bonehead accent and sings: \\"Or destroy a woman's face.\\" With that doofus-dipthong on the word \\"face\\". It sounds so retarded and it's so unforgivable. It's arguably misogynistic in its insensitivity. It manages to be self-deprecating and misogynistic at the same time. It's the worst case of musical self-sabotage since John Lennon & George Harrison filtered the horn sections in GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING & SAVOY TRUFFLE to the point where they sound like kazoo sections.
B00000DFRS|2.0|This album is definitely not the big success that Whitney's diehard fanbase would like to believe. It failed to make the top 10 of Billboard and while it did manage to gain many moderately successful singles, nothing here can hide the fact that Whitney Houston's glory days are over.<br />Much of that is caused by a poor choice of material. Whitney selected a bunch of midtempo songs that neither entice nor excite the listener. Her attempt at tackling a big ballad, &quot;I learned from the best&quot;, fails because of poor production values (whoever picked that dated keyboard sound really needs to be fired). Houston's vocals are also desperately below par; she is no longer the expressive vocalist that she once was.<br />Still, the album's biggest fault lies in its pretention that Whitney Houston is a contemporary R&amp;B artist. Houston was an exceptionnally gifted, soulful pop vocalist who could infuse the most generic songs with palpable emotion, and invest them as if her life depended on it. It wasn't just a question of belting notes or holding them forever - she had feeling just as much as she mastered the singing techniques. Nowadays, she's just a lazy vocalist relying on special guests, background singers and production tricks. She has been losing steadily her audience by pretending that she's an R&amp;B artist, but the scary truth is that she's not convincing at all in that area.<br />&quot;My love is your love&quot; does have a few bright spot - the title track is one of these songs that slowly grow on you, and &quot;Until you come back to me&quot; is one of her most convincing ballads in ages. The rest is just forgettable and mildly enjoyable filler. Buy her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package instead - you'll get the singles from this album, but you will spare yourself the rest of this pathetic attempt at sucking up to the R&amp;B community.
0375501851|3.0|I applaud Smith's writing syle, as it is original, raw, witty, and fresh. However,simpler words could have been used in place of bigger ones to fit in with its respective context. The first half of the book was quite boring, whereas the second half picked up, then went down again. The characters in their teenage and early adult lives were interesting and funny.If Smith had kept to this detail more than going back into Archie and Samad's old days, the book would have probably been better. I also did not find the end of the story very strong. Some parts were just going on and on forever, hence becoming too predictable the next time around. For example, Samad's character was very real, but one knows he is never going to change his fixed mind, how he cannot fathom the concept of his children growing up in North London, being uber religious to the point that he turns to hypocracy by cheating on his wife, drinking, etc. Furthermore, Alsana's character, again very real, does not change. On balance though, this is what Smith most likely observed in her youth and decided to write about it in a journal (this is the impression I get)but there is a distinction between writing journals and novels. I think this needed a bit more work in the editing department. As someone mentioned in these reviews (\\"Did Smith have an eraser\\"?- are my sentiments exactly). Given the fact that she was only 23 when she wrote this novel, as stated above, I do applaud her, since this is her first novel. She wrote very well, but some of the basic stuff like whatever+ whichever= answer( I cannot remember the example) was unnecessary, it did not fit the context in order to make the paragraph/chapter fresh. Ironically, when Smith wrote in simple prose, it was fresh in its execution. She has wit and humour and I hope her new books are more consistent. I just found myself getting bored and putting the book down from time to time.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Look down the list of reviews.  This band is great. I just listened to this album for the 4th time and this time it really hit me.  Great lyrics, great rhythms, creative, alien sounding, symphonic, rocking, innovative, loud, I don't know- more words. I've gotten away from melodic alternative music in the last several years, It's a tough game.  If you write a couple of nice songs but maybe aren't as melodic as some of the others people don't like you anymore, or they think you've lost it.  But no kidding - Almost every song on this album is great.  Trust me, trust everyone who reviewed this CD.
B000040OBS|5.0|I want to say this is Throbbing Gristle mates with Soft Cell; certainly a bloody, unpleasant and painful experience for Soft Cell, no doubt. But, Suicide predates them both. Wow, this is tremendous music.<br /><br />I can't believe that I've never heard of these two musicians before. A 1978 release that boldly bludgeons the music world, then and now. It's 2005 and this stuff still kicks the living crap out of any counter culture music; whatever that may be, that's what they've done to \\"it.\\"<br /><br />If you like Throbbing Gristle, you'll love these guys; at least you should, because I thought Throbbing Gristle was so damn original until I heard Suicide. If you love Soft Cell, you may appreciate Suicide. It's an amazing auditory journey that perverts any notion of what music should be.<br /><br />I'm purchasing their other album.<br /><br />This is a must for those who've heard of, and like, Throbbing Gristle. Even if you haven't, this is a powerful experience that will not so subtley tear your soul apart and spit it out with putrid bile.<br /><br />Is it Punk? Hell yeah/Sort of/Not really...<br /><br />Is it industrial? Not really but...<br /><br />It's tremendous....
B00004U8JV|4.0|<br />Having read both Jurassic Park books, I can honestly tell you the film is very different. This movie is based mainly on Ian Malcolm, whose main objective at the beginning is to rescue his girlfriend, who has traveled alone to the long hidden Site B, an island where the dinosaurs for Jurassic Park had been born and raised. After being abandonned for decades, the island has been somehow thriving. The research team goes over to investigate, with Malcolm coming along only to save his girlfriend Sarah, when all of them, including his daughter who stowed away in the trailers, get more than they bargained for. It ends with the foolishly ambitious new head of InGen importing a live T-Rex and it's child into San Diego and the chaos and terror that results. Although it is not quite as good as the first movie, there is something about it that you can like.  <br /> <br />Plus it's better than the horrible thrid movie. Hopefully you'll enjoy it not from the perspective of the book, but as a film in general.
0060920084|1.0|Just because a writer can turna phrase doesn't make what he says funny.  Apparently Bryson needed to make a car payment so he cranked out this book.  There clearly is not a town or a person in America that Bill Bryson cares for, so it's a good thing he lives in England.  This is not a gentle joshing of small town quirks or traditions - it's outright trashing of everything he sees right down to calling the waitresses ugly and wishing he could bash an old lady's head because she talked too much.  I didn't finish it, and frankly, I'm not turning it back to the used bookstore - I'm throwing it away.  You want a travelogue through small-town America?  Go read Steinbeck or Charles Kuralt, or plenty of others.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|<br />Zoolander is the hilarious story about a male model played by Ben Stiller, trying to find his way in \\"the business\\" with his manager, played by Jerry Stiller. He ends up becoming friends with a woman reporter and his opposing model Hansel, played by Owen Wilson in order to combat the quickly realized evil corporation under Jacobin Magatu, played by Will Ferril. <br /> <br />A wacky and hilarious \\"look\\" into the world of male modeling which is crazy from beginning to end. Well worth seeing.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I heard \\"I don't Wanna be\\"  months ago, and have been trying to find out who it is.  Love the music, but the voice is what caught my ear.  A little Stevie Wonder flavor, but still very original.  Not many singers give me goose bumps.  Hope he makes lots more music.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|<br />The first thing I noticed here were the gross inaccuracies. I can overlook those, almost every historical piece has them.  <br /> <br />But the poor acting, bad writing, and poorly cast heros I cannot ignore. Paris is a shameful character and I believe I have disliked him the instant he was on that silver screen. I love Orlando, don't get me wrong. He was great in Pirates and LOTR. But why did he have to be such a weakling, overly-dramatic, coward in this film?!  <br /> <br />The entire movie has a melancholy feel to it and the characters are hard to connect to. I know it's supposed to be mostly from the side of Achilles, but you end up feeling bad for the trojans in the end. And Achilles himself is the most heartless creature I've ever seen, except for his affair with the priestess. All the Greeks come off as the bad guys automatically.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong though, it's still a pretty good movie. It's got no plot twists, especially if you know the details of the story, but it's alright. My only real grief with it is the portrayal of Paris, who should be a romatic lover and not a frightened weakling. 3/5 stars because I still partly enjoyed it.
B0007OCG56|5.0|This was a great movie. It was deep, and interesting, and left you thinking about it for a day or so after watching.
B00005AR3G|5.0|<br />You will laugh from beginning to end. The jokes are timeless and my friends and I are still throwing quotes from this film back and forth all the time and just laughing about them. Kronk is by far the funniest character, especially during the scene where he talks with his shoulder angel and devil and when he is chasing after Kuzco (David Spade) with Yzma (spelling?). The lovable Paca, played by Jon Goodman, adds a heartwarming element of redemtion for the selfish, vain Kuzco and in the end you just want to say 'awwwwwwww'. By far, one of the most hilarious movies, animated or realistic, and worth every penny.
B00003CXA2|3.0|Give me a break, this is nothing special. The only reason this movie has the kind of reputation is does is because of the proven fact that it is impossible for someone to play a leading role in which a character is mentally handicapped and *NOT get a nomination, let alone have the movie received well. Think about that for a second and you'll see that's true. There are no movies that weren't received well where an actor played a *main character with a *mental handicap. (keep in mind the asterisked words, that's what qualifies my statement)<br /><br />There are movies like this I do like, this is simply not one of them. This was boring because the film had no direction, it simply feels like you're watching the biography of a person from some historical text played out on the big screen. It's just one episode after the next depicting the heroic acts of Forrest and showing the relationships between him and the people he meets, but all these events don't build into any storyline you can care about. Each individual episode presents its own challenges to Forrest, but these feel isolated and doesn't build to any kind of payoff.<br /><br />If you like stories like this, go watch [[ASIN:B0007RT9LC Sling Blade]], it's a much better movie that doesn't put on a facade of being some grand spectacle of our time.
B000059TEP|5.0|<br />Justabout everyone I know has seen, and loves, Ghost. Starring Patrick Swayze, the story is a romatic, comedic, and supernatural adventure. It is about the tragic death of a man who is very much in love with his girlfriend. As a ghost, he returns to his world to observe and realize the scheme behind his murder. As an attempt to be able to speak to his old girlfriend and warn her about his corrupt ex-friend, he teams up with the charlatan pyschic played by Whoopie Goldberg. It is a hilarious, romatic, and beautiful story that is definitely worth seeing.
B000002C1W|4.0|A Momentary Lapse of Reason is very different pink floyd album. Gilmour writes all the songs roger waters is isn't in the band and mason and wright do not play that much and write nothing. but songs like learning to fly, one slip, on the turning away and sorrow are amazing. but songs like a new a machine part 1 and 2 and yet another movie just suck. buy this cd but don't expect a animals or The Wall kind of good.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album is perfection.  It's hard to see how Stevens can surpass it on his next go, but for now, let's just sit back and savor this one.  What all folk albums ought to sound like.  If you're new to the folk genre, this is a great place to start--it's pretty much impossible to dislike \\"Illinois.\\"  Each song is carefully crafted and genuinely beautiful. <br /> <br />Five stars, for sure.
B000000OQF|5.0|Perhaps the greatest rock album of all-time.  It's debatable, but certainly in the Top 5.  GN'R burst onto the scene with \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", which was a fitting song to make a splash with.  Also happened to be one of the most successful rock songs of the 1980's.  Next was \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" which is arguably the greatest rock song of all-time.  It's not even debatable that the song has THE best guitar solo ever written.  Slash was on fire on that track, and I know professional guitarists, who play guitar for a living who can't even come close to handling that song.<br /><br />\\"Paradise City\\" was the next release, and at the time, it broke MTV records for the most days at #1 on Dial MTV, which was the early version of TRL.  At the time, you could get away with having a 6 minute video, but these days, it would most certainly be cut down to 4.<br /><br />Almost every song on this album is great.  Every album has a few weak songs, and yeah, a few of these songs weren't all-time faves of mine, such as \\"Anything Goes\\", but overall, Appetite for Destruction solidified itself as one of rock's finest albums.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Here is my review for \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" <br />It's Like That: 8/10: Great song, but you get tired of it after a few plays. <br />We Belong Together: 10/10: One of the best songs on the album, no wonder it's a #1 single!!!!! <br />Shake It Off: 10/10: Great song! This is the 3rd single and what a great choice A Surefire hit!! <br />Mine Again: 10/10: Nice song, great lyrics <br />Say Somethin'(feat. Snoop Dogg): 10/10: I actually liked it!!! <br />Stay The Night: 7/10: To me ,it's a filler, and I always skip this one, I DONT KNOW WHY!! <br />Get Your Number(feat. JD): 7/10: Good song, but JD& Mariah could do better than that!!! <br />One and Only(feat. Twista): +++++++10/10: BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!!!! WOW!!! LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!! <br />Circles: 10/10: Beautiful song! <br />Your Girl: 8/10: Again, another filler!, but pretty good! <br />I Wish You Knew: 10/10: Love this one, I always sing along to it! <br />To the Floor(feat. Nelly): 9/10: Good Song, fits Nelly perfectly! <br />Joy Ride: 10/10: This song almost didnt make this album, but Im glad it did!!! <br />FLY LIKE A BIRD: 10/10: Great ending to a Great album!!!! <br />Overall: A+++: One of Mariah's BEST!
B00000JS1M|2.0|Once I finally discovered Saxon, I started searching for their back catalogue of albums. With each album I found, I started liking the band more and more. I was certain this 1983 release would continue this trend. It appeared, at first, that it would live up to my expectations. The title track is amazing! The 5:53 anthem has excellent warrior lyrics and, musically, is up there with the best of power metal. \\"Redline,\\" with its squeaky guitar opening, is a typical Saxon motorcycle song. It is not stellar but good . So far, things seem right on track towards another excellent Saxon album. <br /> <br />Things begin to taper off some with \\"Suzi Hold On.\\" It is sappy and pop-sounding, though not as sickening as \\"Waiting for the Night\\" off Rock the Nations. Still, it is not a high point.  This version offers a track entitled \\"Midas Touch\\" instead of \\"Suzi\\" and, from the audio clip above, it seems like a much better song, but I am basing my review and grade on the tracks I have on my version. \\"Nightmare,\\" musically, is good but the lyrics really detract from the song. A grown man singing \\"I'm afraid of the night\\" is just silly plus the \\"Where were you\\" part is syrupy. Hopefully, things will improve with the second half of the album. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the second half begins with \\"This Town Rocks\\" which is a new low. Usually Saxon writes excellent odes to rock and roll (\\"Denim and Leather,\\" \\"Rock the Nations,\\" \\"We Came Here to Rock\\"), but this one is not one of them. The chorus \\"This town knows how to rock\\" is embarrassing. I rush to the player to skip this track. The next number, \\"Warrior,\\" is my favorite on side two and, next to the title track, is the only other real stand-out. It is fast and furious track with solid vocals and lyrics. \\"Watching the Sky\\" is OK at best. It has a memorable, catchy chorus although it is a bit sappy. The 7:00 epic \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" seemed like it would end the album on a stellar note. With a title like that, how could you miss?Well, it surprisingly falls flat. It starts with a long instrumental opening that drags. The meat of the song is excellent with a celestial guitar riff and vocals that launch into some power chords. Unfortunately, it doesn't last. The guitar solo seems unoriginal and just fades. It is a let-down. It is an interesting track in places, but is drawn-out with no real climax. <br /> <br />I really like Saxon but Power and the Glory, as a whole, is only average and, for this band, way below average. It offers two killer tracks, but that is far less than I have expected from a Saxon album.
0312979479|5.0|This is the type of mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end! I'm also in love with the old-fashioned English style of the writing and the characters. Everyone is always so polite! Well worth reading if you are intersted in a quick and entertaining read!
B00000DGUY|1.0|this sucks.  I was just listening to one of my favorite songs, Money for Nothing, I mean this is one of my favorite songs of anybody I listen to, and the song got sensored, the lyrics about the little faggot...that's his real hair... <br />WELL THEY TOOK THAT OUT.  Why does the world have to be so damn PC?!  If it offened someone in the first place they would never buy the album.  If it doesn't offened you, then you DO buy the album.  Let the buyer make up his/her own mind on what they want to listen to. <br /> <br />this is like when a radio station only plays part of a song because they think it's too long.  ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE THE SONG IS BECAUSE IT'S LONG!  gimme a break!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just saw a Serenity trailer before WOtW and that trailer was better than the whole movie. I LOVE JOSS WHEDON! His stuff is so good! Buffy, Angel, and Firefly. This series is so different that wakens you up to the sci-fi shows of past.  Definitely get this series. But now dont watch till after you see the movie!
0312995423|2.0|This is the third Dan Brown novel I've read and frankly, I'm unimpressed. The others (Angels and Demons & The DaVinci Code) were at least somewhat believable and enticing. I decoded one of the key revelations of this book by the 10th chapter (within the first 8th of the book). Likewise, the pass key needed at the end is shockingly obvious long before the brilliant team of mathematicians sorts it out. Once an English major can decode such obvious answers it's hard to buy that the characters you're reading about are the most intelligent men & women in the United States.  <br /> <br />This book is full of unlikely situations, transparent characters and pathetic cliff hanger chapter endings. It feels like an amateur's work, not the brilliance of an internationally acclaimed author. In true Dan Brown style, however, he does throw in a sharp jab at the Catholic Church (which, while amusing noting its source comes off as a cheap shot that undermines his entire crusade).  <br /> <br />Dan Brown knows how to draw in readers and keep you flicking to the next page even when you aren't sure why you're bothering. If you're a fan of his other works, read this for the sake of comparison (and hope for all you aspiring novelists that the one you're writing is probably better than you thought). But don't waste your money on it...make friends with your local librarian.
0515127485|4.0|I have already read Fatherland and Pompeii by Robert Harris.  Both of these books are some of the best reading I have ever done in my entire life.  Archangel can now be added to that list of favorite novels.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and when you pick it up and start reading, it keeps you interested from front cover to the back cover.  It is just plain intense.  I would suggest this book as well as Fatherland and Pompeii to anyone who is interested in anything historical.  I love detailed and how much research Harris does on historical facts... it shows.
1573223026|5.0|A Long Way Down is the fifth novel by my favorite author, Nick Hornby. While it doesn't rank with the greatness of his first three; Fever Pitch, High Fidelity, and About A Boy, it has a charm all its' own. The premise is somewhat morbid: What happens when four sucidial strangers bump into each other at the exact moment they most need one another - on the roof of one of London's most infamous suicide spots? While that's obviously a bit of a contrievience in and of itself, Hornby takes some additional literary license throughout the novel to put the characters in a series of highly comic scenarios. The thing is, I didn't mind one bit. It all works, and I laughed constantly while reading.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These movies are phenomenal. We are here to review the movies and the quality of the DVDs, not complain about the changes. If you are going to post a review, you shouldn't be biased about the changes, just review the films for what they are... movies. I grew up with the originals, and even still pop in my old VHS tapes but the DVDs are really superior. The only complaints I have are that sometimes in IV the sound is not up to par and that in a couple of scenes Luke's lightsaber is green instead of blue, while Vader's sometimes appears pinkish. Overall, these movies are still some of the best with a story that really is timeless.
B000002UJQ|5.0|\\"Ok Computer\\" is Radiohead's first album after what many people consider Radiohead's finest album, \\"The Bends\\". I happen to think that OK Computer is just a notch above the Bends. The Bends was a little bit more focused on the music, whereas OK Computer is more intimate with the listener. Every song on this album is memorable, with amazing, creative guitar parts and Thom Yorke's voice which cannot be copied. If you are interested in Radiohead but have never seriously listened to them, I recommend this album before you buy The Bends.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis released (What's The Story) Morning Glory in 1995. At the time, the band was gaining tremendous momentum as their previous release Definitely Maybe was a huge seller in their native Britain and was a moderate success in the U.S. with the tracks \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Rock N' Roll Star\\" receiving moderate airplay. Although the songs on their debut were a tad more consistent, (What's The Glory) Morning Glory showed a maturity in Noel Gallagher's songwriting and a diversity in their sound which opened them to a bigger audience. And like all great albums, Morning Glory grows on you with repeated listens.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Hello\\" and \\"Roll With It\\", two great rockers that combines the noisy production of their debut with catchy choruses and melodies. The tracks \\"Some Might Say\\" and \\"Hey Now!\\" are solid mid-tempo songs with great vocals from Liam Gallagher while the excellent \\"Morning Glory\\" is the most furious track. Which leads us to the more mature tracks which are the album's calling card. \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is an awesome dose of psychedelia while \\"She's Electric\\" is a great pop song with its Beatlesque harmonies. \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" both contain huge hooks and just as on their debut have melodies that stay in your head long after you hear them. How these songs didn't become Top 10 hits in the U.S. remains a mystery. Finally, \\"Wonderwall\\", their only huge hit in America, is one of the best songs of the '90s. A fantastic album from one of the great rock n'roll bands of the last 15 years. Highly recommended.
0316776963|5.0|Where other Sedaris books fell short, was the fact that each of the essays stood on their own, but altogether the book seemed to have a bit of randomness to it. Although I loved that aspect as well, when I read Me Talk Pretty One Day, where the stories were all relevent and flowed together nicely, I saw another side to the book. Ultimately I feel it's that very side that has kept it near my bedside, or in my bag for a read every now and again, it's jaw-ache funny, but at the same time shows a vulnerability in Sedaris.
B00005JNEI|3.0|OK So I finally saw this film last night on a movie channel.  I watch Moore's films strictly for entertainment value, they are different than other films, like, say, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" or \\"The Mighty Ducks,\\" these are real films with real people.  I don't worry too much about the political issues involved, because of course, there are two sides to every story, so I wouldn't want to make any judgments until I have listened to Mr. Moores opposition, which I do intend to do by viewing some of the anti-Moore material out there (Michael Moore Hates America etc.).<br /><br /> Anyway, I really enjoyed Bowling for Columbine b/c it had a lot of interviews with kids that were about my age at the time, and it was interesting hearing from those whose lives were affecting by the Columbine tragedy.  Therefore, I was intrigued to see \\"more from Moore\\" in hopes that Fahrenheit would be just as interesting and entertaining as Bowling for.  I was kind of disappointed.  It was a lot about politicians and foreign policy that I didn't really know about or care to try and understand without hearing both sides of the stories.  One segment where American soldiers in Iraq were interviewed was very interesting, but frankly I couldn't care less who Bush had over for dinner one night.<br /><br /> So I guess what I am trying to tell you, the reader of this review, is not to order this movie thinking, \\"I loooooved Bowling for Columbine, I can't wait to get more (similar) stuff!\\"  No, this movie is lacking that certain spark that Bowling had for me.  If you aren't really that interested in politics I wouldn't recommend this movie to you.  I still give it 3 stars cause its not bad at all, I just found it disappointing after Bowling.
B0000024IE|5.0|I can't vote this as the Best Rap Album ever Made. However I can vote this as One of the best - see you gotta include KRS-One (Criminal Minded), EPMD (Strictly Business), Run DMC (Raising Hell), Eric B. & Rakim (1st two albums), etc.... or better yet I can call this the best crossover/mainstream rap album of all time that didnt sell out.
B00097A5HW|2.0|<br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Shakira is one of the most praised Latina artists in the world. Her simple yet, unsuperficial lyrics, good stage presence, sweet rough voice and overall talent have been evident since her debut in the mid 90's.  <br /> Her ''crossover'' to  english in 2001 with the album ''Laundry Service'', proved to be a fructifurous endeavor and huge step in her career by gaining her a new audience, fans , and well deserved respect as a female singer/songwriter.  <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this new album '' Fijacion Oral'' (Oral Fixation)is very distant from the her previous discographic material. This time, the artist experiments with the tone and timbre of her voice using new rythms and somewhat experimental sounds and tunes, that do little justice to her quality of voice.  <br /> <br />The hit single '' La Tortura'' along with Alejandro Sanz, is the only song in the album that resembles to her previous work, cathcy rythms and sexy lyrics. The other 11 songs, one which is the reggeaton version of the '' La tortura'', are a completely different scene for Shakira. Her collaboration with legendary Argentinean producer/singer/songwriter and ex Soda Stereo front man, Gustavo Cerati, places the album at a good level of  productional creativity, that might not please the taste of the average Shakira fan. This album is Shakira's most introspective, deep, and experimental work to date.Although, it is a good intent at something new, it is a fast and radical change from her usual style.  <br /> <br />My advice to anyone who wishes to buy the album: listen first and then decide.  <br />
0064407667|5.0|I'll admit this is a very unfortunate, evil, sinister story, but as you read along you begin wondering about Count Olaf.  And as the story progresses, thing get worse and the plot unravels.  After this is over you move on to \\"The Reptile Room\\", which I also recommend.  But, I'll go into that when I review that book. <br /> <br />The story begins with the introduction of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, 3 very intelligant children who know that there's always something.  Something to invent, something to read, and something to bite.  Violet, the oldest, is one of the world's greatest 14-Year-Old inventors.  She can take almost anything and build almost anything with it in almost any circumstance.  Klaus, the middle child, is a 12-Year-Old reader.  Nothing pleases him more then spending an afternoon filling up his head with a book's contents (and he never forgets anything he reads either).  Sunny, age unknown, loves bites things.  Sunny speaks in a series of unintelligible shrieks.  But, these 3 children over go something huge when they find out their parents have died in a fire that's destroyed their entire home.  This makes for a lovely beginning, doesn't it?  Ha ha ha... WRONG!  Gets worse. <br /> <br />Next up, spending time with Mr. Poe (the banker in charge of the Baudelaire orphans affairs) and his family.  There's nothing interesting about this part.  So, we'll skip ahead to Count Olaf.  This son-of-a-***** is so sinister, it makes me angry to read about him.  He makes them do chores that an adult should be doing, he calls them \\"Orphans\\", his associates are also ******* beyond all reason, and he does so many bad things to them.  This all builds up through a series of unfortunate events to a play at the end, \\"The Marvelous Marriage\\" by Al Funcoot, in which Count Olaf disguises his real marriage to Violet as a marriage in a play in order to gain control of the Baudelaire fortune.  Of course, she outwits him by signing the marriage documanet with her left hand instead of her right, as the marriage law states.  The law is that the bride must sign the document in her OWN hand.  And Violet's right-handed, so signing it with her left hand saves the children and their fortune.  He escapes and so ends the story.  However... it gets better (but not for the Baudelaire children). <br /> <br />The 2nd is called \\"The Reptile Room\\".  Pick it up off the shelf if you want to read the next chapter of the series.  I, personally, am reading them 1-By-1 from my library.  I'm up to book # 7.  Read the series, it gets so much better.  A mystery becomes involved, and more people... oh, it's the work of a true genius.  I recommend the entire series.  Read 'em all.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Pay no mind to those who bag this album.  There are 7 reasons to buy this album: SQUARE ONE, WHAT IF, WHITE SHADOWS, FIX YOU, TALK, A MESSAGE, LOW, and TWISTED LOGIC.  This is Coldplay in their element.
B00005A46T|4.0|Iowa is awesome and underrated but i dont know why, cuz this album is awesome. I cant see why its 3.5 stars at all. Iowa is better than vol 3 by far. I would reccomend this to any slipknot fan.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril, surprised me pleasantly unlike many of her compatriots with a highly listenable, tuneful and sufficiently Rocking second Album. <br /> <br />When I ordered the Album I was predicting it to be a bust as so often these are. <br /> <br />Keep it coming. So young and so talented.
0767817729|5.0|This is probably the best movie Costner ever made, with \\"Robin Hood\\" a close second. Costner is superb,coming across as a kind and good man as well as extremely sexy. \\"Revenge\\" is also beautifully filmed and gives us a romance to sigh over!!!! You will remember this movie!!
B000066NW0|5.0|After all the crap from the unmentionable heroines of todays Pop/Rock, here is genuine talent. The album is unconventional enough to not have been some idiots vision of what the public want. <br /> <br />Avril is a welcome relief and amazingly talented and confident for someone so young. A must -hear
B00003CXDD|5.0|I had this movie as a kid, and like Goonies and Monster Squad, I couldn't get enough of it. Simply put, this movie is timeless. For those who have problems letting go of reality and suspending your disbelief, this movie is NOT for you. If you like to watch movies to relax, to laugh and to fall in love with the plot and the characters, then you will love this film. I would recommend this to anyone, especially kids, because it has a good moral lesson at it's heart and allows the imagination to stretch and breathe. The characters are lovable and the plot complete. I'd give this 10 stars if I could.
B00004DTLI|5.0|Excellent sound quality.  I just received this in the mail from France.  A classic CD that has never sounded better.  Buy this French Remaster, it is excellent.  This version is much better than any of the other versions currently available.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Ok well I was bored so after all my exams were finished I went with a friend of mine to go and see \\"Batman Begins\\" I thought it would be just an okay movie but it turned out to be an absolutely extrodinary film that I have seen in years. The acting was very good Christian Bale showed his best performance as the Caped Hero it was better than his acting in \\"American Psycho\\" he showed a GREAT performance but the one that did really good was Katie Holmes although her role was not that major(she was casted 4th on the credit list) she showed a great performance as a district attorney named Rachel Dawes who is the childhood friend of bruce wayne. She and Bruce have a bond and a intimate connection but in the end they decide to go separate ways instead of staying together. Batman Decides to fight the law while she decides to protect it. She dumps him in the end. The Action was good some parts only one the part where Bruce lost his parents and went to a place to train was very boring that was like 25 mins of the movie. I thought it was also quite scary when the scarecrow would inject hallucinageons into people to frighten them its scary. Although this movie was SPECTACULAR!!!!!!
0399241515|5.0|Wow, this was an awsome book (I finished it in six and a half hours, it's that good), but I can't believe the ending! I had to read it (the ending) three or four times because one wasn't enough. Of course, I'd been expecting this to happen thanks to a couple reviews I'd read, but still! Ughh! It was a great book, though. I advise that you read it, but start taking deep breaths near the ending if you're like me because it totally changes in the last chapter. This book was so good, I'll be counting the days until Ark Angel comes out.
B0009QTS1M|1.0|IT REALLY STINKS!!!    FIRST IT WAS SINGLE DISC, THEN THERE WAS A 2 DISC RELEASE AND NOW AN EXTENDED 3-DISC EDITION IS UP FOR PRE-ORDER.     CAN SOMEONE AT DREAMWORKS CLARIFY HOW MANY MORE EDITIONS WILL WE HAVE??    PUBLISHING HOUSES LIKE DREAMWORKS ARE TOO BUSY CASHING IN ON GREAT MOVIES LIKE GLADIATOR AND ARE JUST NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THE HARD EARNED MONEY PEOPLE SPEND ON BUYING EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE MOVIE.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|Thankfully, Oasis makes a fine return to form with \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\", here in it's DualDisc incarnation. <br /> <br />The DualDisc DVD side has some neat stuff, a mini-doc and a video (\\"Lyla\\") but the music is not DVD-A 5.1, merely enhanced stereo, which to me means nothing. <br /> <br />The CD side is where the money is, as the boys have come up an album worthy to follow their first two impressive efforts.  <br /> <br />This is their best album since \\"What The Story, Morning Glory?\\" It's the same Oasis sound we've all grown to love, but they manage to expand their parameters without sounding too arch, too weird or too boring. <br /> <br />I liked the foot-stomping \\"Lyla\\"...it's deceptively simple and maddeningly catchy. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\"...the whole brothers thing, the plaintive vocals...it works. <br /> <br />\\"Keep The Dream Alive\\" has \\"classic Oasis anthem\\" written all over it, as does \\"Let There Be Love.\\" Not too fast, not too slow, epic build-up, sweeping vocals... <br /> <br />The other stuff is pretty good too. \\"The Meaning of Soul\\" sounds like an MTV Unplugged wicked rave-up, and \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" is an example of a terrific song that has a definite \\"Oasis\\" sound, even though that very sound has it's derivation in British (uh...Beatle...) pop music of the late 60's/early 70's. <br /> <br />To those who complain over the obvious Beatle influence I say this: who better to model yourself after? All bands use their influences in certain ways, and nobody uses their Beatle influence better. <br /> <br />Stating it in another way, for Oasis music, the Beatles (and their songs, production, instrumentation, etc.) are their alphabet. They just creates words and phrases that also happen to be pretty freakin' great.
B0000640VO|5.0|I must say, that after seeing this movie, I have never felt so good in my whole life!!! This is an excellent comedy story as well as a sweet and poingant romance! I live for subtitles, so this didnt bother me the least bit, for after a few minutes, you are so into the story that you forget about them until the very end. Audrey Taotou and Mathieu Kassovitz both gave EXCELLENT performances, and are totally believable as their characters of Amelie and Nino. The cinematography and use of color is AMAZING, and the film is worth watching for that alone, but besides that, its such a sweet story about a very shy waitress in Paris (shot on location)who discovers a little secret behind a bathroom tile in her house. And from then on, she devotes herself to doing good to others... but will Amelie ever do to herself what she has done so graciously for others, by seizing the man she loves? Or will she be too shy and let the oppurtunity of a lifetime pass right by her? Well, I guess you'll have to watch this WONDERFUL movie and find out!!!

B00000K0E5|5.0|James Bond changed for a fifth time with this, the 17th official Bond film, emulating the venerable Dr. Who once again.  Fans welcomed the change from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan, and they vaulted this movie to the highest grossing Bond movie at that time.  Brosnan made Bond more suave and sophisticated than Dalton's Bond, with a dash more humor, though less humor than Roger Moore's Bond.  It helped that this movie featured non-stop action and a foe with malice toward England in his heart, and the ability to execute a nefarious plot.<br /><br />In the opening scenes of this movie we see a breath-taking stunt, as Bond, well his double actually, leaps off the side of a dam on a bungee cord.  Bond is penetrating a secret Soviet chemical weapons facility.  We learn that Bond is on this mission with Alec Trevelyan, Agent 006 (Sean Bean).  Unfortunately it appears that Alec does not survive an encounter with General Arkady Ourumov (Gottfried John).  After a daring escape involving multiple close calls, the movie forwards into the present to the Mediterranean.<br /><br />Bond encounters Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and she is behaving in a most unusual fashion.  Of course, Bond may have been attracted to her because of her incredible beauty, but regardless of the reason, she has gained Bond's interest.  We soon observe that Xenia is a most cruel person, and she is ruthless in stealing a super secret helicopter that is resistance to electromagnetic pulses, such as a nuclear weapon might cause.<br /><br />We now move to Severnaya, Russia, where the helicopter has been spotted by satellite.  We have the benefit of going into Severnaya as General Ourumov and sadistic sidekick Onatopp enter the facility and demand an inspection of the Goldeneye system.  It seems that during the cold war the Soviet Union had developed an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, Goldeneye, which was capable of wreaking all sorts of havoc on any electronic equipment in the weapon's aim.  Unfortunately for the personnel of Severnaya, once General Ourumov obtains the control module he has Xenia eliminate the staff of Severnaya.  However, one member of the staff, Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), has survived Xenia and the activation of the first of two Goldeneye satellites.<br /><br />M (Judi Dench) sends Bond to Russia to find out what is going on.  Bond soon meets with former foe Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), who gives him some clues that might lead Bond to the information he seeks.  As a side note, Minnie Driver has a brief role as Irina, Zukovsky's tone deaf mistress.<br /><br />While Bond has been tracking down Ourumov, Natalya has been tracking former Severnaya associate Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming).  After a surprised Bond encounters Alec, he awakes to the yells of Natalya, and quickly learns that they are in the cockpit of super secret helicopter, and missiles have been programmed to fire and destroy the helicopter.  After a typically close call, Bond and Natalya soon end up in the hands of Ourumov and Alec once again.  The ever-resourceful Bond escapes, of course, in one of the best chase scenes of all time.<br /><br />The action speeds onward to a hidden satellite dish, which looks remarkably like the observatory at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.  Okay, I am kidding, it really is Arecibo, except when it is a model.  The action intensifies toward the exciting conclusion that takes place under, around and on the huge radio telescope facility.<br /><br />This Bond movie is as good as you might think it is.  We hungered for a new Bond film in the six years between the release of \\"License to Kill\\" in 1989, and the release of this film in 1995.  The world had changed a lot in that time.  The Soviet Union was gone, and the nature of Bond villains changed as well.  As a point of trivia, this Bond marked the first time a Bond movie actually filmed in the former Soviet Union.<br /><br />You can tell the style of this movie a little by the nomination forSaturn Awards this movie received for Best Action/Adventure Film  and Best Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films (USA).  The movie was nominated for a couple of other awards, and won a BMI award for music and a Golden Screen award (Germany).<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan occasionally looks slightly uncomfortable as Bond, but he quickly makes Bond his own.  By the end of the movie I was comfortable that Brosnan made a suitable James Bond, and was already looking forward to the next Bond film.  I recommend this movie highly to fans of the James Bond series and for fans of action-adventure movies.  This movie is a winner and a keeper.nomination for Saturn Awards this movie received for Best Action/Adventure Film  and Best Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films (USA).

B0000074FG|5.0|I remember buying this in the summer of 1976 after hearing \\"The Boys Are back in Town\\" on the radio a few times. That song is one of the top 10 songs ever!  When I bought it as an LP (remember those?), I was so excited and distracted that I put the wrong side on the turntable.  Instead of that song, out of the speakers came the title track JAILBREAK.  Another timeless classic.  Needles to say, the entire record of 9 songs was fantastic and there truly isn't a dud on here.  Since then I have bought these songs on cassette, CD, and now the remastered version.  Great story in the liner notes too. Buy it and read it for yourself.  It is almost hard to believe the recorded output Lizzy put out in the years of 1975 through 1977.  Quality too.  Hell, \\"Johnny the Fox\\" also came out later that year in '76 and is every bit as good as this, unfortunately overlooked because of the lack of a hit.  Personal favorites on here are \\"Romeo and the Lonely Girl\\", \\"Emerald\\", and \\"Warriors\\".  I love them all.  If you want some great rock songs with excellent twin guitar breaks, this is for you.  See where Maiden, Leppard, and The Darkness got it from in the first place!  My only question on this reissue is why has Scott Gorham been eliminated on the Overlaord's video screen on the cover?  He is the only member from this group performing in the current Thin Lizzy lineup and for some reason, he is missing.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is in the top 5 of my favorite movies of all time.  It started a movement in film that has spawned many other great movies and unfortunately a lot of rip offs.  This is the original horror/thriller movie.  The roles are so well casted that you don't see Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman but rather Dectives Somerset and Mills.  The detailed plot with no holes is such a breath of fresh air.  The mystery and complexity of this movie is almost indescribable.  I can not say enough good things about this movie.
0394800192|5.0|We must tip our hats to the good doctor and his collaborators for a magnificent plot (complete with building tension, climax, and resolution), a fine range of emotions (pride, annoyance, fear, and unbridled joy), and absurdist fantasy (Just how do all those apples stay balanced? How could a lion, tiger, and dog be the same size?)--all accomplished in only 75 words, most of merely one syllable. Let us also praise the clear and clever illustrations, which while a departure from the Seuss style, serve this story just fine as far as this reviewer is concerned. <br /> <br />The best page is the tiger, all by himself, holding his tail suggestively, gleefully orating on the merits of apple-accumulating. <br /> <br />Five, six, seven <br />Fun, fun, fun! <br />Seven, six, five, <br />four, three, two one!
B000067J1H|4.0|Most of you will never read this review because it is going to be burried under countless other reviews.  About 1200 or so to be exacting.  This is a very underrated movie that can only be challenged by the book itself.  Although the book is 800 times better than the film the film had to be adapted to a screenplay that good be accepted, enjoyed, and still maintain some of the mystery.  This movie is a great example of good acting in action, an incredibly humanistic message, and also a type of movie that should reach everyone.  Nevermind what people say that the fights seens and the \\"eye candy\\" of Pitt and Norton are its one saving grace.  The film in and of itself holds itself up for anyone who is open to a great message and a great story.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|This is one of the true and eternal masterpieces of progressive rock. Intense playing, and the remastered version gives an edge to the sound that had not been there before. This is no easy listening though, and obviously the one reviewer who gave it a bad rating did not get into it. Peter Hammill's voice, though in my opinion the best in rock music, is certainly an acquired taste. What I love about this voice (and about the music of Van der Graaf Generator as a whole) is that it gets the emotions through, even if one does not understand a word of English. <br />This record, as wild and experimental as it may be, made it to the very top of the charts (yes, the number one spot!) in France and Italy when it came out, though this is definitely not chart music. Highly recommended.
0805076476|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I have seen the movie and read the book and both are extremely well done.  I ahve to say however that I loved the book more.  The book has so much more to it substance wise and plot wise.  Chuck Palahniuk is either a genius or a psycho either way it makes for great reading.  Once you pick this up you won't want to put it down.  Even if you have seen the movie before reading the book it is still a relatively new story because of the differences in conversation, build up, character roles, and the ending.  This is a must read as well as a must own book.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|Let me just start off by saying what the hell is wrong with movie studios nowadayz? It took Warner Bros. this long to release the greatest movie of all time... Give me a break! Warner Bros. will re-release movies in 5 different editions but we Over the top fans can't get a single bare bones release?  Anyway I'll stop my complaining because its Finally here. This has to be one of Stallone's most underated movies of all time. Stallone is probably the only person who can make a movie about arm wrestling and make it just as exciting as a Rocky or Rambo flick. This movie has it all, pressure, failure, love, and trust. This is deff. a good father and son bondage movie too. Stallone basically  arm wrestles at local bars to make some sweet dough, he finally realizes he has a talent and should take his arm wrestling career alot further than anyone could imagine. So what does he do? He enters an arm wrestling competition to win a new truck and his son goes along with him too. He inspires Stallone to become the baddest, roughest, pugnacious monster alive. Great action great acting....Even though we did get a dvd release, the extras are pretty poor, a decent trailer is all you get, I was deff. expecting a Stallone commentary or possible a behind the scenes would of been nice. Well at least its in a nice anamorphic widescreen!
B000000WCX|3.0|Earthling was a grammy nominee.  When you equate the album with the deivel that usually gets respect at the grammys, it helps my argument that the album really isn't really among Bowie's best work.  To me, Earthling hearkens back to the electonica-infused songs like \\"Loving the Alien\\" more than it looks foward to the reinvigorated songwriting excellence of an album like Heathen.  <br />Earthling's biggest problem is that it seems like more of a showcase for software like Cubase and Soundforge than it does for Bowie's genius.  It's really not too much more than a point and click album even when it works well.    When you DO get to hear guitar, it is often the gratuitous tasteless solo work that I feel Reeves Gabrels excels at.  He is a phenominal guitarist, but he's better off on his own making guitar showcase albums like Satriani and Steve Vai put out.   <br />In case you don't know, David Bowie has a uniquely perfected vibratto and a range that no other rock singer has had since Freddie Mercury.  Where freddie could reach a higher plateau, bowie can sink octaves below while still being able to climb to a silky smooth high register.   You don't get the sense for any of this while listening to Earthling.   I'm not saying that the songs aren't adequately sung.  They are.  They just aren't great showcases for Bowie's talent.    <br />Please don't think that I don't like Earthling.  If I sound harsh, it is not because I think earthling is a bad album.  It really is one of the best of its year.  It just isn't the kind of album I like to see bowie doing.   <br />Personally, I would recommend the live recording from the BBC theater in 2000.  It spans his career and perfectly shows off the greatest voice, and IMO greatest living talent in rock and roll history.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|This ranks to be the best heavy metal album yet next behind Love <br />over Gold by Dire Straits. 5 stars for this music!! Also, in my <br />opinion, this is GNR's only good album! You get nothing but the <br />hit songs! Still also goes great with Appetite for Destruction <br />too. I know it needs 1 more track like Mr. Brownstone from AFD. <br />Still this is good stuff. Anyway, the best songs on this CD would <br />prefer to be Sweet Child of Mine, Civil War, and November Rain. <br />No bad words also included. But there's also one problem, the closer track, Sympathy for the Devil needs to be removed from <br />the CD. Rank number 1.
B0007MVXQG|3.0|I give this album a 3 star.I think the band was in too big a hurry to release this cd.I do like some of the songs.the grind of the guitars could be a little more heavy.I think they can do better.DO NOT MISS THE LIVE SHOW!!! Hopefully they will release another CD in the near future.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I'll give this CD 1 star because Boulevard of Broken Dreams is <br />a good song. Other than that, I've heard Holiday and it is what <br />makes Greenday suck! Here's what to get.
B00078XGRO|3.0|Co-writer Brannon Braga tells a story during the commentary and in one of the documentaries here about attending a showing of this film and witnessing some guy telling his girlfriend \\"See, I TOLD you it would be good\\" after the film.  Brannon then goes on to say that the guy probably had to \\"drag her sorry butt\\" to see the film.  I had a similar, though decidedly opposite experience: when this film came out, I had to beg my wife to go see it with me.  I was SURE the film would be great, the ads looked fantastic!  At the end, we were BOTH disappointed.  Only through repeated viewings have I found it to be somewhat enjoyable. <br /> <br />So what don't I like about this film?  Mostly, I dislike it's total disregard for any sort of continuity with established Trek lore.  Along with that, I have some other unrelated gripes.  Here's a partial list: <br /> <br />1. Picard now somehow has a telepathic bond with the Borg which didn't exist previously to this film. <br /> <br />2. Picard also has an obsession with destroying the Borg, which, again, he did not have previously in the series.  In fact, in the episode \\"I, Borg\\" (oh help me I'm entering geekdom here), he had the opportunity to destroy them all, and REFUSED. <br /> <br />3. If the Borg can go back in time at will, why not just GO BACK IN TIME BEFORE REACHING EARTH?  This way, they avoid the battle. <br /> <br />4. Speaking of the battle at the beginning of the film, Picard and crew are sent to the Romulan Neutral Zone because Starfleet doesn't trust Picard to deal with the Borg since he was once assimilated.  How does THIS make sense, considering he successfully dealt with them AFTER his assimilation in the series? <br /> <br />5. The Enterprise makes it from the Neutral Zone to Earth in enough time to join the battle.  Now, I'm not enough of a Trek fan to know how far from Earth the Neutral Zone is, but I do know that it is very far -- communications alone take a long time to reach Earth from there.  Yet somehow,the Enterprise makes it back to Earth in...oh, about a minute. <br /> <br />6. Data's \\"To hell with our orders\\" line.  I liked it better when it was SPOCK'S LINE (paraphrased) in Star Trek 6.  And speaking of a lack of originality... <br /> <br />7. ...the way the Borg \\"assimilate\\" the Enterprise and take it over, making the environment their own.  I liked it better the first time I saw it, when it was called ALIENS and written by James Cameron.  Continuing on this theme... <br /> <br />8. ...The Borg \\"Queen\\", and the referring to other Borg as \\"Drones\\".  Forgetting for a minute that this totally destroys the whole unified species premise established in the show, I ALSO liked this better when it was ALIENS by James Cameron (see above). <br /> <br />9. The original series states that Zephram Cochrane is from Alpha Centauri, not Earth (though the Star Trek Encyclopedia states that he was probably from Earth and then MOVED to Alpha Centauri.  O-kay...).  Brannon Braga has said in the past that you don't center a film around a character who appeared just once in an episode of the TV series.  That's funny Brannon, since the most popular Trek film is still WRATH OF KHAN, centered around...a character who appeared only once in an episode of the original series.  And how many times, when a new Trek film is released, has someone from Paramount said \\"The new movie has a great villian, he's a lot like Khan!\\"? <br /> <br />10. Not only does the crew reveal who they are to Cochrane, and what he is destined to do, they tell him DAMN NEAR EVERYTHING ELSE they can about the future.  So much for not corrupting the timeline. <br /> <br />11. The continued reduction of Worf to comic relief.  Ha!  He's afraid of zero-g!  It's funny!  Oh, my sides! <br /> <br />12. It sets the stage for the series ENTERPRISE, and the continued destruction of the Trek franchise. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but the main problem here is the total lack of any continuity.  In fact, the film can't even keep continuity with ITSELF!  Example: Picard tells Lily that the ship has 24 decks, but elsewhere in the film, one of the crew states that the Borg control deck 26!  Braga and Moore even address the continuity issue in their commentary track.  Braga admits that \\"sometimes\\" breaking continuity \\"a little bit\\" is neccessary (though he seems to have done it quite often), while Ron Moore recommends eventually just starting over -- taking existing characters and just re-writing the series and its continuity (much like what he did with Battlestar Galactica -- I guess in Moore's re-vamped Star Trek, Spock would be a woman, and any characters who were originally played by black actors would be portrayed by white men or asian women). <br /> <br />Though the film is popular amongst fans, there are those of us who feel that the total disregard for continuity ruins it.  At the time of its release, Sci-Fi Universe ran a two-page spread detailing all of the things they found wrong with the film (going on much longer than I did above).  But if you look past the discrepancies in continuity, the lack of originality and blatant derivation, and some truly dumb humor (not to mention the lack of any real theme -- as Gene Roddenberry or Michael Piller would say, \\"What's it ABOUT?\\"), it's not a bad film.
0060012234|5.0|I just joined the Brent Hartinger fan club! This book is not about being gay, or being straight, or being bi. It's about kids who feel alone, and who reach out to each other and find other kindred spirits. THE GEOGRAPHY CLUB is a great read, no matter who you are!
B00003003R|5.0|If you're a rabid GNR fan like i am and you've heard every song 100 times, its great to get a chance to listen to them live. Unfortunately I've never been to one of their concerts, which I am sure are better than this cd, but this is definitely a great addition to my GNR collection. The performances on Pretty Tied Up, I Used to Love Her, and Rocket Queen are great, especially Axl's little speech before I used to love her. The Sabbath song It's Alright is a welcome addition too, and i thought Axl did an amazing job on it. The cd is packed with energy and makes me wish I could go to at least one of their concerts....but o well. GNR rocks.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|I'm so glad this version of Tess has come out!!!  This is my all time favorite movie...love the story, the acting, the cinematography!  Just hope in the future they'll make a better DVD of it.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Usually it's the other way around. To say that the movie is better than the book isn't saying much. Although its gruesome murders drew feminist fire and made headlines and best-seller lists, \\"American Psycho\\" isn't literature and isn't read today. But this film version is assured DVD shelf life because it largely replaces the gore with the satire that might have improved the book. It may have surprised author Bret Easton Ellis more than audiences that the movie emerged from all the controversy as a chilling, amusing examination of urban alienation. It's not the bloodbath that fans of Quentin Tarentino or George Romero might have expected.    The movie does pay its thriller dues (and paid dearly for its NC-17 rating.) But the filmmakers have more than thrills in mind. They tip their hand with a credit sequence that draws us into a high rise world of sleek bodies and correct addresses. We see drops of blood splashing onto a white surface, then streams of blood, then - - - but wait, it's not blood at all but red syrup and rasberries garnishing plates in a Manhattan restaurant. They're being served to jaded young Wall Streeters who like to trade business cards, wisecracks and insider gossip.     Suddenly, \\"American Psycho\\" is off and running in another direction, away from our expectations.    Stay with it, even after I tell you that our young financier takes an axe to a colleague, has a fridge full of heads and a closet full of bodies, tapes his sexual threesomes, and that at one point he chases a blonde through his apartment building brandishing a chainsaw, naked and covered in blood. Repellent? Yes, but this is a serious movie with serious themes and a serious actor, Christian Bale, wielding the weapons. Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe make appearances but Bale is the whole show. His telephone confession near the end is a sensational piece of film acting.     Nonetheless, you may want to deprive your children and elderly parents of this cinematic experience at this particular time in their lives.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie takes you away to another world. Who know rock and pop music could have such a strong effect on the viewer of a movie. I just got so into the music I was spellbound. It didn't hurt that Ewan is so wonderful and charming or that he and Satine have such strong chemistry in this movie. This was a powerhouse film about Truth, Freedom, Beauty and most of all LOVE.
B0000AOV85|4.0|It is a fascinating look at the making of one the most complex and beautiful pieces of musical art of the last 50 years, if not of the 20th century. However, you will probably get more information if you read online interviews about the making of the album, and less of Roger Waters, god bless him, playing guitar. A lot of the stuff I already knew, but it was still interesting to see them describing it. I wish Mason would have had more screen time, his contributions were just as important, they didn't mention how he had to retune his ro-to toms after each chord change at the beginning of \\"Time\\". Also, all of the long delays were done with tape machines, before digital delays, and it was extremely painstaking (as all the tape looping etc.). I also have the classic albums \\"Who's Next\\" and it amazing how both bands foresaw the time of looping, but the technology had not caught up with them yet. Of course what you gain with digital in ease, you lose in warmth, and it take much less skill to create a computer loop than a tape loop. <br /> <br />Anyway, I enjoyed some of the interviews, but some of it seemed either incorrect or overblown, Gilmour claims that \\"Money\\" is int 7/8 when it's actually in 7/4. Waters claims that the entire album can be summarized by \\"Us and Them\\" and talks about it's greater themese of human capabilities (interestingly similar to Pete Townsends themes in Lifehouse, which became \\"Who's Next\\"). The only thing is, Waters is either talking out his *ss or has really forgotten what the album is about. There is only one song about \\"Us and Them\\", hence the title, the rest is quite individual, about an individual's fears or death, and insanity and making money. This is not really hopeful at all, and the one hopeful thing in the entire album gets squashed by that depressing quote from the doorman \\"there is no dark side of the moon really, matter of fact it's all dark\\" (there is actually more the quote, but they cut it off). I always found this a much too gloomy ending to a album who's last sung message harkens back to the fall from divine grace, that humans are essentially good (as opposed to Locke and Hobbes who view our essential natures are nasty) but that society's pressures forces the dark side out of us, forces us to kill, forces us to become greedy, fearful etc. This is somewhat uplifting, but then to hear that final bit ... Waters probably regrets putting that in (and you know it was him that did it) although he doesn't say it, I bet he does. <br /> <br />Anyway, as you can see, I've been thinking a lot about this album lately! :) It's a good DVD, a good follow up is \\"Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii\\" which has more footage of them actually recording DSOTM, it's a must have for any Floyd fan.
B000002G8J|3.0|It's hard to praise \\"Backless\\" as a great record, but it is equally hard to fault it as a bad one. It's somewhere in between, actually...a number of very good songs and some utterly forgettable filler.    Eric Clapton's seventh solo album is a mixture of rock, pop, blues light and country...the same rather pleasant and certainly unoffensive amalgam of styles that Clapton employed on almost all of his 70s releases, in other words.  He has written or co-written four of the ten songs himself, a nice little rocking pop song, \\"Lucy\\", and, well, some filler. Sure, \\"Tell Me That You Love Me\\" is good filler with some fine slide guitar playing, but it's filler nonetheless.    The covers are generally well chosen, though, from a slightly too low-key performance of Jean-Jacques Cale's \\"I'll Make Love To You Anytime\\" to a swinging, piano-driven rendition of Danny Flowers' charming country-boogie \\"Tulsa Time\\".   And living icon Bob Dylan has co-authored the two best songs on the album, \\"Walk Out In The Rain\\" and \\"If I Don't Be There By Morning\\", both written with Helena Springs. Clapton's take on \\"Walk Out In The Rain\\" is less powerful than Kenny Neal's, but it's good enough.    There is only one blues tune here, but it's a pretty good one...a slow but rather muscular \\"Early In The Morning\\" with some terrific blues guitar playing by the former God himself and nice harmonica fills by an uncredited player (hm!). Clapton could've let loose a bit more on the vocals, though - he showed on \\"From The Cradle\\" that he can do it.    The understated shuffle, \\"Promises\\", the album's single, is not a major song by any means, but it's not bad, and nothing on this album is, actually. It's just that too many of these ten songs aren't all that great either.   But still...Eric Clapton's filler is usually pretty decent, so \\"Backless\\" is worth about three stars, I suppose. It is not an essential purchase, especially since most of the good stuff can be found in equally good or better versions on oneor more of Clapton's live albums, but it is certainly not one to be avoided, either.
B0000009S3|5.0|`Hot Rats' was Frank Zappa's first solo album, not under the name of `The Mothers of Invention' and one of his most purely instrumental fusion works. It may not be his most original because, like Pete Townsend of The Who, Zappa was constantly copying phrasings from one album to the next. The very first track, `Peaches en Regalia' has riffs in it which appear in songs on many of his early albums.<br /><br />While this is not done by `The Mothers of Invention', some `Mothers' musicians perform on the album, including Zappa's main man on saxes, Ian Underwood. Zappa also has some fairly heavy duty guest artists such as Captain Beefheart on the only vocals on the album, Sugar Cane Harris and Jean Luc Ponty on violins on two different tracks, and the very young Shuggy Otis on base on the first track, `Peaches En Regalia'.<br /><br />What is most distinctive about this album aside from the fact that it is almost purely instrumental is that it is the purest sample of Zappa's fusion of Rock, Jazz, and modern classical, as done by one of his musical inspirations, Edgar Varese.<br /><br />When this album was first released in 1969, I thought it was the apotheosis of Zappa's music and it was hard to imagine his getting any better. I still think it is one of his tightest albums compared to some of his later sprawling efforts such as `200 Motels', but it may not be as entertaining as `The Mothers, Fillmore East, 1971' which was the inaguration of the collaboration of Zappa with the two remaining members of `The Turtles', Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan.<br /><br />This, plus the very first album, `Freak Out' may be the two albums you most want to have if you need a good sample of what Frank Zappa was all about.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I think the DVD is great. It is an amazing once in a lifetime event. It is great to watch with a child who just got his first guitar. He will see all of the legends at work. I think that it was more a public jam session than a concert and more or less just the names attracted the crowd. They were jamming and having a good time. Not playing to impress. They've already done that.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This show is absolutely stellar. This recording does it great justice however Idina Menzel is not my favorite in the role of Elpheba. If the recording were to consist of Shoshana Bean as elpheba then the recording would be 5 stars. I truly think Shoshana brings something strong to the role. When she becomes wicked its something truly remarkable. Idina is amazing in the role however shoshana is perfection. Kristin Chenoweth is flawless in her comedic timing and everything. Joel Grey is forgettable.His songs are even more forgettable. Defying Gravity with Idina is very good however with Shoshana singing it It is truly AMAZING. She says forget all u people im gonna do what i wanna do. Wicked all together is an amazing show. GO SEE IT. LISTEN TO THE RECORDING AND GO SEE THIS SHOW
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot isn't usually a band I'd buy a CD from... But I enjoy their music but don't really intend to buy much of their CD's other than that. Anyway, I did though enjoy this album a lot though. I mostly enjoyed the accoustic guitar which mellowed things down a bit. (unlike their other albums.) Also the lyrics to most of the songs were very good. I think this is a good album to let soemone listen to if you're interested in learning more about Slipknot. This currently is their present album but I'm sure it won't be their last. Other than that...all that can be said is that this album was very well done.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This well-crafted thriller by director Michael Mann offers not only edge-of-the-seat suspense but also solid characterization and cinematic mood.  Jamie Foxx, in an exceptional performance, plays taxi driver Max who still dreams of starting his own business while trapped in his night job of driving fares around LA.  When he inadvertently picks up hit man Vincent (Tom Cruise), everything comes down to survival as his life depends on Vincent's slaughter of others.  Detective Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) is the only one who sees the connectivity of the murders and who may be Max's only chance of rescue.<br /><br />The surprise of this movie is the acting and chemistry between the two stars, Foxx and Cruise.  Both give their characters depth - and the viewer perversely understands both Vincent's affection for Max and his willingness to kill him.  But Foxx is the man we identify with, not only because his life is in jeopardy, but because of his dreams, his principals, and his mix of fear and astounding bravery.  The viewer is with him every step of the harrowing way.<br /><br />The soundtrack is good, and the mood created by Mann of a late-night, underbelly LA is exceptional.  The movie has a classiness that many thrillers do not.  Its major flaw is the relative predictability of its final scenes.  While Jada Pinkett Smith turns in a fine supporting performance, she stands in for the typical Hollywood gotta-have woman who motivates the male protagonist.  Her role is all too clear early in the film; however, Mann adeptly diverts the viewer by his suspenseful handling of plot and character.<br /><br />Recommended viewing for thriller fans.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I think Audioslave's self-titled album is great. The beginning songs of the album start you off with loud rock. (Which by the way is amazing.) Then as you sink in, you start to see more creativity. Especially in ''What You Are'' and ''Shadow On The Sun''. Toward the end, the songs are good but I prefer the first couple of tracks. Overall though, the album is good for a first record from the guys of RATM and 1/4 of SG.
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt's TRAGIC KINGDOM is a classic album from the mid 90s. It has a unique sound that no one else was making at the time. There is a unique mix of reggae, punk, and pop found on this album. I remember how huge it was at the time. It has really aged well...10 years on and it's still a very listenable album. Singles included \\"Just A Girl\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", \\"Sunday Morning\\", \\"Don't Speak\\", and \\"Excuse Me Mister\\". The album has a whole is great and there is no filler! Classic!
B0000TLA9G|4.0|G&R's Greatest Hits album was great. I enjoyed it for many reasons....first off because I heard some songs that I never gave a chance to before and then I ended up liking them. Not only that but the album has an okay collection of G&R's hits. I'm sure not many G&R fans would like this (mostly because they mainly list songs that were played on the radio and such) but this album wasn't horrible or anything. I wish there were a few more songs added to it but it was well put together overall.
B00004XQ8E|5.0|For a performance more than 50 years old, it sounds really good. Kudos to the engineers; I never knew the early 50s recording can be that good. Kudos too to Bruno Walter, a close friend and great interpreter of Mahler, and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, certainly one of the world's finest orchestras.<br /><br />  Personally, I didn't really like Julius Patzak on the tenor. He sounded to mellow, less dramatic compared to James Kings on a rivalling performance done by Bernstein with the same orchestra (and the same label) 14 years later.<br /><br />  Kathleeen Ferrier, on the other hand, is an absolute winner. There's something really special about her performance that really makes me want to cry, particularily in the \\"Farewell\\" movement. She sounded very rich and warm when she was singing in moderate registers, but very sweet and delicate - fragile even as if she know she was going to live no longer - whenever she took the higher notes. By the time she sings \\"Everywhere the lovely earth blossoms\\" I was in tears, knowing that this would be one of her glorious moments in her career before dying of cancer. Fischer-Dieskau's performance (with Lenny) was touching in one thing, but Ferrier's performance was an excrutiating experience...<br /><br />  May her performance touch others... for ever... and ever.
B0000027RL|4.0|This album (which was my first PJ album btw) was indeed awesome. The songs were great and I love PJ's sound. I can't wait to get their other albums because I already know that they're all good. Pearl Jam is one of the best grunge bands from Seattle! *other than Soundgarden =D* Pearl Jam's other albums feature more songs that I like but this album was a good first choice. I reccommend this album to anyone who wants to get a good listen from 90's grunge. :) *thumbs up*
B0001KZM3O|4.0|This is possibly the most underrated album Floyd ever released next to \\"Animals\\" and \\"Atom Heart Mother\\". Many fans criticize harshly on this album, but there is nothing wrong with it. The lyrics are amazing, the melodies are catching, and the atmosphere is dark and gloomy. It's one of Floyd's most somber, low-key albums as well. It is true that it is more of a Waters' solo album, but just look at what one of the reviewers in the spotlight section said, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\", the next album, is sort of a Gilmour solo album.  <br /> <br />Gilmour was a great musician and singer, but Waters carried the foundation. With the exception of \\"The Division Bell\\", Floyd wasn't all that great with just Gilmour at the helm...
B0000844I8|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I thought this is a great scifi movie. Then I recently this past year got Stargate Sg1 Season 1 for christmas. After I started watching it. I thought this show pretty good. After that I was hooked. I was watching 2-3 episodes a night. I am already on season 6. Thats how good this show is. It takes place only 1 year after the movie, and continues, now 9 years later.I recommend buying the movie and all 7 seasons that are currently out. You don't want to miss this series. Its too good to pass up.
6305079811|5.0|I remember purist fans of the original Flash Gordon being disappointed with this work, but it's an absolute treasure for devotees of the late lamented musical group, Queen, as well as for those who consider Ornella Muti the most beautiful woman of the 70's.

B00082IJ08|1.0|The 1st album was great due to Dan the Automator's quirky beat making skills, which matched the Gorillaz style.  Now there is a different producer doing the production, and the group no longer has the cartoony feel, which made it famous.  I think the songs are dreadfully boring and lame.  The 1st cd showed that you could be different musically and make it interesting.  This album fails miserably in that regard.

B0009IW88A|4.0|Okay, for all of you out there expecting to have a Danny Elfmanesque soundtrack of the 1989 version of Batman - don't get your hopes up.  For those of you who thought the soundtrack should be reminiscent of the original score to the 1989 original should rethink the approach that Christopher Nolan took when he did this film.  The Batman movie saga has been dragged through the dirt since Tim Burton's first entry into the Batman saga was made 16 years ago.  When asked to add another addition to the saga, Nolan had to do take a very drastic and different approach to this film in order for it to be successful.  In my opinion, by leaving every notion of the previous Batman films behind and bringing a newer, alternative approach to the saga, Nolan accomplished what every Batman film director after Burton should have been striving for but didn't.  This film was well-done and created a style completely separate from its predecessors, which has made it successful.   <br /> <br />As I finished watching the movie last weekend with my wife, I turned to her and said \\"good movie, great soundtrack.\\"  A great soundtrack can make a good movie great or make a bad movie look better than it actually is.  It has the ability to increase emotion and to create suspense where the film may not.  I thought Batman Begins was a great addition to a saga that had become a joke since the first one was made, and adding a soundtrack created by two marque composers made it that much better.  Zimmer and Newton each added their own personal, yet subtle themes to the soundtrack while also creating a sound completely unique to this film, yet different from their own personal styles.  Anyone who has heard Zimmer and Newton each know that they carry the style of one film over from the next.  You can hear very distinct similarities from one film to the next.  The only other composer who does this more than Newton and Zimmer is James Horner.  However, despite their personal styles, they both managed to createa unique and distinct sound that complemented this new addition to the Batman saga.  Too many people focus on the movie's composers and how their style should match the movie but it should be the other way around - they should create a unique style to suit the movie.  Zimmer and Newton did this and still were able to add their subtle, yet individual touches to this score.
0143034901|2.0|With so many rave reviews out there, Zafon doesn't stand a chance. This book was an enjoyable distraction, but I read most of it the way I read articles in People Magazine, with my ears tuned more to the outside world than the inner world of the novel. Full of predictable surprises and the creaking door of a \\"scary\\" plot, Zafon's novel is drizzled lightly with metafictional hocus pocus about forgotten books and labyrinthine libraries. While the nods to Borges, Eco, Marquez, and Dickens made me buy and read the book, they ultimately made me long for the originals. They are unforgettable: this book, alas, will disappear in the recesses of my memory almost as quickly as my second (and every other) novel by Steven King.

B00002E23E|3.0|When 'The Song Remains the Same' came out in cinemas way back in 1976 Led Zeppelin were really giving fans an experience of them 'Live' but on the big screen.  <br />Unfortunally fast forward to the year 2003 & much anticipated \\"DVD\\" is the complete picture of the career from 1969 to Knebworth 1979.  <br /> <br />Granted it was released several years ago, but it really needs 5.1 sound mixed. Still good to watch but showing it's age in production / camerawork & lack of any editing.  <br /> <br />A Robert Plant DVD would be a worthy edition to my collection if one does finally get released.  <br />
0385513755|3.0|This book is a 456 page long history and symbology lesson. You can just stop reading now-that's about all this book has to offer, along with a little intrigue on the side to keep the reader entertained.<br /><br />Before I get into this review, I should point out that this Special Illustrated Edition is a godsend-I cannot imagine visualizing the settings or symbols properly from the text alone. I simply cannot realize how anyone could derive a shred of enjoyment from reading the normal version.<br /><br />Firstly, the sheer amount of research involved in the writing of this novel is quite frankly insane. Dan Brown is clearly an incredibly dedicated man with an eye for detail. The use of setting and symbolism is flawless, beautiful, perfect.<br /><br />That said, the other aspect-the intrigue-falls somewhat flat. The whole novel is started by an elaborate puzzle created by a man with fifteen minutes to live. I cannot bring myself to believe that a man with a bullet lodged in his stomach could create such an ELABORATE puzzle(Including the creation of several complex anagrams) in the brief time he had left, especially with a wound distracting him. The heroes of this story stumble through the novel, being saved by one odd coincidence after another.<br /><br />Furthermore, this novel loses a star because of the sheer mass of idiots who do not comprehend why it is placed in the 'fiction' section.<br /><br />Although I would hesitate to call this a truly bad book, I can safely say I won't be picking it up and rereading it again any time soon.
0333710932|5.0|Oh no!  THE GRUFFALO is special order only?  What a shame.  This excellent, rhyming book is lacking in only one thing...marketing!   <br />This silly-scary book is a joy to read aloud to your little one.  If you are a parent who is bored with reading so-so children's books, get THE GRUFFALO.  I promise, you will enjoy reading it as much as your child will love listening to it.  In my opinion, this is one of the best read-aloud books since Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat.   <br />So, even if you have to special order the book, take a walk with a little mouse as he out-smarts all the animals in the \\"deep dark wood\\", including...THE GRUFFALO! <br />
B00005OWEG|3.0|The original of this move is by far superior to the redux version. <br /> <br />Some of the additions are as follows: Captain Willard steals a surf board from Robert Duval's helicopter battalion. Captain Willard is a character that is psychologically destroyed and alienated from society. He states \\"I hardly said a word to my wife until I agreed to a divorce\\", \\"when I was home all I could think about was getting back into the jungle\\", and \\"I'm waiting for a mission\\". He is a serious professional assassin whose inner life consists of missions. He has no other reason to live. He's lost and dissipated without a mission as can be seen in the opening sequence of the movie. It is totally out of character for him, in the middle of combat, to steal a surf board. <br /> <br />Another addition that detracts from the movie is that on the journey up river they stop and find play boy bunnies. Captain Willard trades 2 barrels of fuel so that his boat crew can have sex with them. This again is totally out of character. Willard was not partying in Saigon. He would not jeopardize the mission by trading fuel for sex. <br /> <br />The worse addition is the French Plantation that Willard stops at shortly before meeting Kurtz. The whole mission is a journey deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness, deeper into chaos, deeper into the jungle.  The river gets narrower, the banks get higher, it's as if they are being swallowed up by the jungle. Then suddenly they are at a very beautiful and comfortable French Plantation with excellent French food, wine, and cognac. The French debate the politics of the war and compare the French and American experiences. Then a beautiful French lady, who smokes a huge thick cigar, takes Willard up to a beautiful bed room and lights an opium pipe for him and then closes a mosquito net around him while he relaxes in a comfortable bed. It's take the audience totally out of the journey into the `heart of darkness\\". <br /> <br />Another additional scene is where Marlon Brando reads a magazine article about the war to a semiconscious Willard. <br /> <br />The editor saved this film the first time. This is a useful study of how bad a great film might have been. <br />
0312995423|3.0|To call Dan Brown's \\"Digital Fortress\\" a great work of fiction would be laughable. However, it was very entertaining so I have to say it was worth a read.  This is the first Dan Brown novel I've read and I'm going to start on \\"Angels & Demons\\" later today.   <br /> <br />It's a fast read.  I'm a sloowwwww reader and it only took me a few hours in total.  The action is fast and the cloak and dagger shenanigans made for page-turning material.  It could be classified as in-flight reading material at best, which make for wonder guilty pleasures. <br /> <br />[MINOR SPOILER WARNING] <br /> <br />The major GLARING ERROR Dan Brown makes (although if I was tech-saavy I'm sure there would be more) was that if Strathmore designed a backdoor and didn't care if the pass-key got out in the open after he put the backdoor into place then common sense seems to be abandoned.  Most people intersted already had the encrypted version of the code. Why in the hell would the redownload this new copy?  Strathmore was a bit desperate and even says \\"hopefully they'll download our version\\" or something to that effect.  So, it seems like that plot hole was merely glossed over by an idiotic line of dialogue.  It was so annoying in fact that it took me out of the book a bit. <br /> <br />[END SPOILER] <br /> <br />Despite that, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is a midly impressive first novel and I look forward to see how he improves as a writer as I read through the rest of his works.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Robert Plant still has it! His outing with Strange Sensation is nothing short of SENSATION-AL! He's managed to fuse elements of contemporary rock with his proclivity for Indo-Arabic-folk influenced music, especially in the tracks \\"Another Tribe\\", \\"Takamba\\", \\"All The King's Horses\\", \\"The Enchanter\\", \\"Dancing  in Heaven\\" and \\"Somebody's Knocking\\". The blues inspired \\"Let The Four Winds Blow\\" and \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" will have you toe tapping and booging like you did in the days of Led Zep. Thematically, Plant gives the listener a commentary on his life, music and beliefs. All in all, the album in some respect is similar to the  [[ASIN:B000024FP2 No Quarter: Jimmy Page & Robert Plant Unledded]] collaboration.
B0002S94OS|4.0|This is a really good Cd for about anybody that likes metal. The music is brutal and the production is crystal clear. At first it sounds like the vocals was somebody playing with a voice over machine and then by the third song finally learned how to use it. But even the vocals get better as the Cd goes on. This is just brutal American metal that out plays the other offerings by this band. They finally put it together on this one. A really good Cd for any fan of metal.
B00079ZACM|1.0|MGM, the DVD distributor for The Four Feathers, should be ashamed of the shoddy treatment they have given to this magnificent film.  Known for its rich early Technicolor photography, many shots in The Four Feathers are out of register and of inferior color quality. The print is also scratched and worn. The only money invested seems to be in the glossy new packaging, without a penny to the movie inside. If a film this great wasn't worthy of restoring you have to wonder what is. If this is your first time watching this wonderful film, stay away from this DVD; if you've seen and loved it before you'll shriek in horror.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I originally tried this video back in college and it worked well for me. I actually broke it into three sections (abs 1,chest and abs2 on one day, abs 3, back and arms on another day and the cardio/leg on another day) due to my time schedule. It worked well both this way and as a whole workout. I like the non-intimidating nature of it. There is no \\"bouncy fitness bimbo\\" telling you in an annoying voice \\"Your doing great -oh can't you feel that burn... blah blah blah\\". The instructions are simple, and there is a glossary of moves to help you be sure your posture is correct. I feel althletic with this workout, not clumsy and annoyed as with other videos by popular workout experts. I love to walk and swim but this gave me a great workout indoors. The varied backdrops and music keep you going but are not overwhleming. Also there are water breaks throughout the program. Now that I am reaching 30 and have gained a fair amount of weight I am again returning to this video and am actually purchasing it on DVD since my VHS version is wearing out.I would reccommend this workout to all others who are not \\"Gym\\" people and wish to get a good workout at home.
0743487478|5.0|I would like to offer different interpretations to a couple of the criticisms in the other reviews here: <br />-On the topic of praise (i.e. saying , \\"Good job!\\") being negative, the point Kohn is making is that children who are praised are likely to lose intrinsic motivation for doing whatever is earning them praise which has a long term negative impact.   <br />-On the notion that referring to yourself as \\"Mommy\\" to your child when the child is old enough to understand pronouns creates distance between you, he is making the point that you are more likely to consider yourself on a higher level than your child by giving yourself that label.  Doing *that* distances you from your child as you are then relating to them less as a fellow human being and potentially more as someone under you and your control. <br />This book is phenomenal; it offers a different way of looking at our relationship with our kids.  Parenting is a hard task, and he doesn't claim to be perfect.  I am grateful to all parents who are willing to read this and rethink the programming they have been subjected to all their lives.
B0006213H6|1.0|Let me start by saying that I absolutely adore Sigur Ros, but this album is just horrible. Sigur Ros is a band that can be quite inconsistent. One minute they can have one of the most beautiful pieces of music you will ever hear (Vaka off of ( ) is probably the best example that comes to mind) and then they can drone on into mediocrity the next. This album is a large collection of the latter unfortunately. It was nothing but a random collection of noises and nothing else. I cannot imagine anyone being able to listen to this and come away with anything meaningful to remember. I can only redeem myself in buying it from a collecting standpoint, otherwise, this is probably the most excruciating album to listen to that I own...
0385336810|4.0|Like many others have said this is a fun book.  It doesn't requite deep thought or a list of notes to follow along, (which is exactly what I want in a book that I am taking to the beach) I laughed out loud and I cheered for our heroine when she landed her man. <br /> <br />The book follows the standard chick-lit plot.  Boy and Girl meet, fall for one another, someone does something wrong, then they find their way back to one another.  I must say this book offered a new transgression, one that I found myself hurting alongside our heroine as she suffered the indignities of her partner. <br /> <br />This was my first book by Kinsella, but it certainly won't be my last.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Review by Cory Rennison: <br /> <br />Since the beginning of Foo Fighters' career, it's probably safe the say that even the most diehard fans have waited for an album that truly showcases the band's catchy sound. The problem with older albums was that there was always a few \\"radio hits\\", and the rest of the CD was filled with mediocre tracks. Well, finally Foo Fighters have released In Your Honor, a double disc set, featuring some of the bands catchiest and most solid work to date. <br /> <br />With In Your Honor, Foo Fighters have separated their electric side and their acoustic side. The first disc is filled with straight out rock songs, nothing more, and nothing less. Instead of making just a few hit singles, it seems like Foo Fighters were much more focused going into making this record because every song could potentially make it on the radio, however, it's not watered down as so many other \\"rock bands\\" on the radio. <br /> <br />The second disc of this double-disc set is the acoustic portion. Some people might be afraid to even pop this disc in because they fear acoustic music on any Foo Fighters album and might not want to hear a whole disc of it. Anyone that feels this way should still give the disc a spin. Surprisingly enough there's more than acoustic guitars on this disc. Dave Grohl plays harmonica and drums on two of the tracks, and there's a slew of guest appearances, the most notable being Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age, and even Norah Jones, whom offers up her piano and vocalist skills. While some parts of this disc seem to drag on, it's actually a lot better than you might expect. <br /> <br />Overall, I would go as far as saying this is Foo Fighters best work to date. It's very clear that they actually put some time into this record because the end result is impressive to say the least. If you've ever been a fan of the Foo Fighters, or even if you're just a fan of the dangerously catchy hit single \\"Best of You\\" from this album, pick it up!
B000957O7S|5.0|When I had purchased this movie, it was with the hope it'd be full of humour, fun to watch (no matter how many times), and possess a romantic flavour.  Not only did the movie meet all my expectations, but exceeded them.  Will Smith does an incredible job in playing Hitch and I've found myself laughing over and over at the antics both he, and the other characters, present.  This movie immediately went straight to my list of favourites and it's a tough list to get onto.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Where only one of the best tv shows revolves around!!! I LOoOoOoOOve Veronica Mars, she was a fresh & welcome delight amoungst all the reality tv and bull crap! Veronica is the updated hipper version of Nancy Drew (who I adored growing up) and it's just such a great dramedy....it's got the drama (can anyone say- mama drama? perhaps \\"did I sleep with my brother??\\") it's got the comedy, it's got the mystery, danger, so forth...It's just a wonderfully delightful show and I can't wait for season 2!!

0385513755|5.0|I orginally was scepticle of buying the book \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" because of all the publicity it had been receiving.  I've learned that most books (or anything else for that matter) that receives that much publicity, is usually a boring and not that interesting book (more me anyway).<br /><br />I saw this edition of the book, and felt it would be a better edition with its extra content of pictures to help visualize where the characters are and where their going and what they are talking about.  I've never seen the Louvre, so the pictures and diagrams helped tremendously!  The pages were also of a greater quality than the paperback edition, or the standard heavy weight paper used for hardback books.  The pages were a heavy glossy base that helped to make the book special and unique.<br /><br />As for the story line... I found Mr. Brown did take some literary license, but hey... it's fiction!  Besides, it was a terrific and awesome book!  I am glad I bought this book and took the time to read it (which didn't take me long since I couldn't put it down).  The intrigue and thrill of following Langdon and Sophie kept me going and wanting more!  I look forward to reading Angels and Demons.<br /><br />Too bad so many other authors feel they have the right or need to attach their names and books to this one in critizing it for not being accurate.  I just don't get it... it's fiction people!  Get a life!
B000002HMH|5.0|Metallica showed the world that they can actually write melodic tunes instead of thrashing out the same stupid boring guitar riffs over and over. <br /> <br />One of the best albums of all time.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is that rare gem of a movie that takes its audience seriously.  So many of the movies out of Hollywood are geared towards the 16 to 25 year old male perspective.  Action, dumb plot, stupid characters, etc.  \\"Neverland\\" is a movie that doesn't pander to emotion.  It doesn't show us yet another unnecessary action scene.  And it doesn't make every relationship obsessed with sex.<br /><br />What you get with \\"Neverland\\" is a movie that takes you to another time and gives you insight into the mind of a great writer and the experiences which influenced him.  It is a patient movie, more interested in creating a tone and place to help us understand the concepts of Neverland, imagination, and reality.<br /><br />While perhaps not the focus of the director (and probably unnoticed by most viewers), \\"Neverland\\" is also a refreshing depiction of a male character dealing with children.  While Barrie is depicted as being child-like, he is still a grown man with an adult's ability in relating to children.  Far too often we're inundated with media images of the stupid father figure, the doofus, who doesn't have a clue.  With Depp's characterization of Barrie we see a man who can play with children and yet still be an adult.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, almost as matter of course, once again delivers a performance that is all the more amazing given his body of work as a whole.  This the same man who did \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\\" and a dozen other movies in widely divergent character roles.  And Kate Winslet seems to be only getting better with age, both in ability and beauty.<br /><br />There seems to be a number of reviewers claiming that \\"Neverland\\" is slow or that it's pretentious.  If you enjoy well made movies you can ignore these comments.  Of course, don't fall prey to the hype, either.  \\"Finding Neverland\\" might not become your most favorite film, but it is worth both viewing and owning as a DVD.  I can't say that about too manyfilms these days.
0060764899|5.0|Many `key' events in my life retain only hazy places in my memory, but I can tell you exactly where I was, when I was first introduced to \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". My first grade teacher Ms. Enderlin read the book aloud to my class. Each day she had a reading time after the noon recess. Ms. Enderlin opened the book, Lucy opened the wardrobe, and I opened my eyes to a whole new type of story. That was over twenty years ago. <br /> <br />A young girl named Lucy attempts to hide in an old wardrobe and inadvertently discovers  a portal to an entirely different world -- the land of Narnia. After her initial visit to this land of speaking beasts and a tyrannical witch, Lucy decides to return with her three siblings Edmund, Susan, and Peter. In Narnia, Edmund falls to the seductive beauty of evil. Lucy, Susan, and Peter strive to save their corrupted brother and defeat the White Witch who has enslaved the talking beasts. <br /> <br />\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" offers a fantastic opportunity to expose young readers to fantasy literature. Parents who are looking for something to read with their children will especially enjoy this book and the others in the series. Lewis writes with a distinctly conversational tone that lends itself to being read aloud. Though geared primarily for children (grade school age), the Narnia books will be equally appreciated by adult readers. <br />
B000002H97|4.0|I actually became a fan of Metallica on this album after seeing a few music videos on TV, \\"Enter Sandman,\\" and \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" and hearing a few songs on the radio. I was not a fan of Rock & Roll or Heavy Metal at the time, but I did like the tunes that I saw and heard, so after receiving my weekley allowance (I was 14 at the time) I went to the local music store and picked it up. Sure the songs are less complex then say \\"Master of Puppets,\\" or \\"...And Justice for All,\\" but that doesn't mean they are bad, I don't understand all the ney-sayers. This is a full on Rockin' Metal album, so if you love bands like AC/DC, Guns & Roses, Whitesnake, or Skid Row, then you're gonna LOVE this. After hearing this album, I was compelled to get all their older stuff and thus...the birth of a 'metalhead.' Metallica has gotten me into all kinds of Metal...Iced Earth, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Pantera, Venom, Anthax, Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society, Hammerfall, Testament, Blind Guardian, Running Wild...the list f_cking goes on. I don't bash Metallica at all for their direction of music and I will always have full respect and a place in my Metal heart for them. <br /> <br />Proud Metallica/Metal fan since 1991.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I really wanted to see this in theatres and never got the chance, so I finally have seen the movie and am not sure what to think.  I was expecting something that was maybe a little Romeo & Juliet with the Vampire vs. Werewolf thing going on, but I don't know.  This movie really didn't pay any homage to old Vampire/Werewolf mythology, it didn't really have much action, and the Romeo & Juliet thing is not really expressed and there's only one kiss between the two main people.  Kate Beckinsale is alright as the main Vampire, but Scott Speedman (you may have seen him in Dark Blue, an excellent movie) really doesn't have much to add to the film, and was sort of a waste.  I thought the Vampire Werewolf hypbrid would be kind of cool, but the transformation was alot cooler than the end result which looked like a guy painted gray with sharp teeth and claws, very creative.  The end result of this movie was a boring anticlimactic piece that is something like The Matrix was, starting its own trilogy, which is what I think they're doing.  It really has nothing new to offer now that Blade has shown us another view of Vampires, and it sure as heck isn't funny.  I can't really say you won't like it, but I can't say you will either.
B000001DTM|4.0|This album is the most ridiculously overated U2 album ever. <br />While it has some of the best songs ever record \\"Even Better Than the real thing\\" \\"Zoo Station\\" \\"One \\"Until the end of the world\\" \\"The Fly\\", the rest are beyond awful. <br /> <br />\\"Trying to throw your arms around the world\\" and \\"Whos gonna run your wild horse\\" are  terrible, if you want U2s best album, you'll find that its \\"Pop\\". <br />

B000088E6D|1.0|If I had the choice, I would have given this album a rating of zero. But because Amazon insists on a rating of at least one, I have to give it that.  <br /> <br />I must agree with my fellow reviewer Kurt, and also put myself in the minority, when I say that this young man shows an incredible lack of respect for the original artists when he tries to gain recognition and fame by redoing songs that were made popular by the originals and are thus, clearly identified with them. However, not only does his style show a lack of respect, but it also displays an obvious lack of creativity when 3/4 of the songs on the album are covers, and original compositions are in the minority. Another problem that I have with Bubl, is that he attempts to take songs that are not at all related to his style of singing, songs by artists like \\"Queen\\" and the Gibb brothers, and shape them into swing/jazz pieces to serve his purposes and utter lack of creativity. The least that you can do when you remake a song, if one chooses this regrettable route, is remain faithful to the original style and intent of the song.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately Bubl only succeeds in showing the world that he is simply another Sinatra impersonator, no more, no less. He only adds insult to injury when he attempts to capitalize off of signature Sinatra songs. He doesn't stick simply to the standards that all singers of Sinatra's time recorded at one point or another, but has the audacity to cover \\"Come Fly With Me\\", \\"Try A Little Tenderness,\\" and \\"Nice and Easy\\". Any individual familiar with Sinatra and his repertoire recognizes the ridiculous ploy that is being engaged here. If I want to listen to Sinatra songs, I will listen to Sinatra, and not some grasping, copy-cat. Perhaps the most regrettable aspect of Bubl's career so far is the fact that he can carry a tune, and yet he chooses to use whatever talent he has to continue to gain popularity by singing songs that were done perfectly well the first time around. Therefore, not only is he not creative, but also selling himself short. Do everyone a favor young man, make your own classic songs and stop stealing everyone else's.      <br />
B00005NP04|5.0|This album has so many great songs.  Martina has a beautiful voice and her songs have great lyrics that each seem to tell a story.  If you like female vocalist type of easy-going country music, then you will love Martina McBride's music.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I read some pretty bad reviews of this new DVD on the site, but I have to disagree.  I am a hard-core American Psycho fan and think it's one of the best, least known cult classic films around.  It's getting more exposure now with Bale's \\"Batman\\" fame, but start-to-finish, this movie has always been one of the funniest and entertaining films in a long time. <br /> <br />The reason this DVD is important (\\"crucial, really\\") to own is because of the five deleted scenes.  All five are very original and not just different takes or segments of scenes already in the film.  You won't believe the one of Bateman and Courtney in bed, and the Bale-Witherspoon exchange in another scene is priceless.  I was dying (pardon the pun) laughing all night after I bought this. <br /> <br />I do agree, however, that while the makers of this DVD have all the characteristics of human beings - flesh, blood, skin, hair - they don't possess a single, clear, identifiable emotion except for greed, and disgust.
B000002KXV|5.0|This is the 5th time I have bought this product, albeit in different formats-I wore two vinyl LPs out, my tape snapped and my last CD version was borrowed and never returned. Without going into a track-by-track review (there is one in the reviews that more than does the job), let me say that this HAS to be one of the finest musical collections in the last few decades. There simply isn't a bad track here.  <br />If you want the ultimate music for doing anything at all, driving, relaxing, it doesn't matter-this will fit the bill. <br />The highlight for me is the version of 'Ruby Baby' which has transformed the 'doo-wop' version into a slick track with Manhattan Transfer-like harmonies, complete with a piano solo that sounds as if it's going to be 'You really got me', but just goes onwards and upwards. <br />If ever an album was 'required listening'-this is it. I wish I had an extra star to give...it's THAT good.
0064471837|5.0|I am a Nix fan; I came upon this book while shopping and have no regrets at all with this buy. The story takes place in a kingdom where the dead can be brought back and there are evil demons and ghouls all over. It's the Abhorsen's job to send them back to the Ninth gate and there final rest with there seven bells.  But there is a safe place, in the city of Anelstierre, where they a protected from the dead. But a evil monster that was banished years ago to the Seventh gate has crawled its way back and plans to take over, this is unknown to Sabriel until she gets a bag from her father from the old kingdom. So Sabriel go to the Kingdom in hopes of finding and freeing him, along the way she meets Mogget, a powerful spirit servant that has been forced into the form of a cat by a powerful ring that forms a collar that ever taken off can lead to untold disaster and death. She also meets, or more like finds Touchstone who can't remember, or doesn't want to remember his name, who is a basterd prince, but is the only one left of the royal family, trapped in wood on a ship, she frees him and takes him along. They make it to where her father is but it is too late, her father is dead, and not dead, he lives but only for a certain amount of heart beats, so they must escape and hurry back to Anelstierre to warn them about the coming doom, but the question is, will they be able to defeat a creature that has survived hundreds of years, and generations of Abhorsens?
B00004TH6O|5.0|This CD was my first taste of Queens of the Stone Age.  I liked it.  So I went back for more.  And more, and more, and more still.  For me, this CD never keeps me bored because it is so diverse in the types of music it goes after, but the absolute high point for me in 'R' has to be song number nine, titled 'Tension Head'.  This song has 'pissed off' written all over it, with the grinding guitar and Oliveri absolutely shredding his throat like he put it to a cheese grater.  Very good to work out to. Other standouts for me are Lightning Song, I Think I Lost My Headache, Better Living Through Chemistry, Quick and To The Pointless, and Feel Good Hit of the Summer.
0833567357|5.0|This is truly one of my favorite books from my childhood. I first experienced Ed Emberley when visiting a friend who had the book.  We would spend hours building \\"worlds\\" of our own on paper using 4 simple colored markers (red, green, blue and black).  I purchased this book for my 4-year old daughter in hopes she would take to it the same way I did as a child.  She now spends hours drawing imaginary worlds using Ed's simple shapes to make everyday things you see in our world. Browsing through it today I find it virually unchanged from the original 1972 printing. Suggestion to parents: Pay the extra $$ to purchase the library hardback version. The book stays open easier using a paper clip and will last long enough to pass to your grandkids ;-).
B00074CBMY|2.0|Let me preface this by saying I am an expatriate Yorkshireman who loved to go to the 'Black Swan' in Sheffield in my late teens to listen to Joe and his Blues band.  Listening to this effort makes me shake my head in disbelief. The opening song-U2's'One', was never a strong piece of material and Joe does nothing for it, in my opinion. The blandness continues with 'I who have nothing' and a dirge-like version of 'What's going on?' which has had every piece of emotion taken out of it. You almost get the feeling he was reading the lyrics while recording it. Perhaps the worst track is McCartney's 'Maybe I'm Amazed' and I had to smile when he sings the lyrics \\"maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something that he doesn't really understand\\", because it seems to me that musically in this mish-mash that he really doesn't.  The production is clinical to the extreme, to the point of being sterile, and I got the feeling that this album was put together just to highlight the talents of the guest guitarists. To me the most noteworthy is the solo by Jeff 'Skunk' Baxter who rescues 'Chain of Fools'. Jeff Beck excels in 'I who have nothing', and Steve Lukather rises above the murk of track 3, the Marvin Gaye song that once meant something. The best track is 'I put a spell on you', which is more 'Joe' than the other stuff, and an adequate solo by 'Slowhand' makes this song listenable. After that, to paraphrase Neil Young \\"it starts off slow and fizzles out altogether\\". The 2 stars were for the guitar solos.  The 'bonus' track is a live rendition of 'One' in Belgium. Some bonus.  I was given this CD as a Birthday gift. I'm trying to figure out what I have done wrong to the person who gave it to me.  I had to chuckle when one reviewer said that Joe is at the peak of his career...I would say you are 20 years late on that one, having seen him 16 times since 1969, that last time with Tina Turner in Ft Lauderdale, this latest offering is one that will probably make a 'swap-shop'pretty soon-for a 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen' CD to replace the one that's almost worn out.     Addendum: In the two years since I reviewed this CD, I went to see him live. He didn't do anything from this collection in the show and the fact that you can buy it now for 89 cents.....well....it's now a bargain.

No cause for these blank spots in his life was ever found in spite of extensive tests. His father suffered a similar problem and was institutionalised, Evan is afraid this will be his fate too. To try and make sense of what was going on he was encouraged to keep a daily journal. Although Evan had no memory of what happened during these episodes it was obvious from the behaviour of those around him that some horrific and traumatising events had happened.<br /><br />When his mother decides to move the family to a different town the blackouts stop. Evan grows up and moves away to university. This is where the film takes a twist. Evan finds that reading his journals propels him into the past, to the events that scarred him and those he cared for, particularly his childhood sweetheart, Kayleigh. He realises that he can control this and even change the events. But like the saying `when a butterfly flaps its wings a hurricane is felt on the other side of the world', Evan finds that for everything he changes, there is a knock on effect and it isn't necessarily good.<br /><br />This is a dark and at times very disturbing film. The situations Evan faces are, at times, nightmarish. Ashton Kutcher, better known for lightweight comedic roles, shows he is capable of taking on more serious roles. His performance as the troubled young man is outstanding. The end, when it comes, is quite shocking yet somehow fitting. This is not a comfortable film to watch but is well worth seeing if you want something a little different.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica's third full length offering, 1986's \\"Master of Puppets,\\" is a landmark album if I've ever heard one. At the time it was the most influential album since vintage Black Sabbath and it is, to this date, one of the most important and best albums of any genre of all time. Many, many people consider \\"Master of Puppets\\" the best metal album of all time and even though I, personally, prefer Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power,\\" this album is definitely a bigger, more original, and more important album (important to the history of heavy metal). Plus, \\"M.o.P.\\" is arguably better just because it came before \\"Vulgar\\" (it's up for debate whether Pantera would exist if it weren't for Metallica).<br /><br />Black Sabbath came before Metallica and they influenced more bands (including this one), so I consider them the epitome of heavy metal; but Metallica are definitely next in line.<br /><br />Compared to this album's two predecessors, particularly 1983's \\"Kill `Em All,\\" this album is equally as heavy, but quite a bit slower and more complex. \\"Master of Puppets\\" is still speedy, and possibly the last true thrash album the band ever made, but it is also made heavy metal commercially accessible (partially because it sold several million copies and spawned several hit singles).<br /><br />But, influentialness aside, there's another reason why \\"Master of Puppets\\" is doubtlessly one of the three best C.D.'s I own: it's simply as good as heavy metal gets. All eight tracks display excellent musicianship, and every track is a flawless, very catchy, very exciting, and memorable hit. This is truly a standard setting, legend creating, genre defining album. \\"Master of Puppets\\" has some of the best musicianship I have ever heard. All band members are at the top of their game, and it's because of albums like this one that Kirk, Lars, and Cliff will go down in history as some the best musicians of all time.<br /><br />1. \\"Battery\\": This song is partially famous because it has an acoustic, almost Spanish sounding guitar intro. Bands like Sepultura and Shadows Fall would later adopt this, but on \\"Battery,\\" it sounds like something you'd hear in a Zorro movie. The heavy guitar chords make a sudden appearance, and the song then turns to a running beat with fast guitar riffs. With a fast, thumping beat and a great guitar solo, this song is (like all of the tracks on here) very catchy.<br />2. \\"Master of Puppets\\": I don't know where to begin describing how great this song is, so I'll just say it's the best and maybe the catchiest heavy metal song ever.<br />3. \\"Thing that Should not Be\\": This track begins sort of like track one, \\"Battery,\\" with light strumming. But then it, out-of-nowhere, becomes a pounding rhythm with heavy, churning riffs.<br />4. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\": The album slows down a little bit, with this song. It has good lyrics (about being in a mental asylum) and singing by James, and the verses of this song lead well into the heavy choruses. But this song only really speeds up after the second chorus. Another classic Kirk Hammett solo is also included.<br />5. \\"Disposable Heroes\\": This song has fast, chugging riffs, and there are six beat changes, when the song and guitar work become even faster.<br />6. \\"Leper Messiah\\": The beginning has stop-start riffs, as well as an almost slowly galloping beat. It gradually becomes faster and, near the end, there's a killer give-and-take between Kirk, James, and Lars.<br />7. \\"Orion\\": This is possibly the best instrumental song in history (even though \\"Call of the Ktulu\\" is pretty damn great, too.) This song fades in and becomes increasingly fast and heavy with staccato riffs. The song abruptly stops, about halfway through, but it's not over yet; an entirely new beat (a stop-start rhythm) begins and this song goes on for a few more minutes. The musicianship on \\"Orion\\" is superb, by every band member.<br />8. \\"Damage, Inc.\\": This song begins with bobbing riffs, before it becomes another awesome give and take, with machine gun guitar riffs and drumming. The beat pauses for the choruses, James whispers \\"damage incorporated,\\" then the verses pick up where the last one left off, making this song very fast paced, blood-pumping and exciting. I also enjoy the part of this song when, near the end, James shouts \\"Go!\\" and Kirk lays down one last great (and very fast) guitar solo.<br /><br />So, \\"Master of Puppets\\" is masterful. Many think Metallica went downhill after this album, mostly because this was their last with bassist Cliff Burton. I don't care what you think of Metallica now-a-days, there is no disputing that \\"Master of Puppets\\" is the best hard rock album of the 1980's and, to this day, is one of the best albums-of any genre-that you will find. Even almost 20 years later, it is one of the best and most important albums of any genre of all time. This album is so wonderful, it is the landmark by which all heavy metal albums are judged. The bottom line is, the words \\"great\\" and \\"classic\\" don't even begin to describe this opus. You NEED to buy this album, or you will forever be un-metal.rumming.

B00006LLNU|4.0|This album, along with Bjork's \\"Vespertine\\", is probably the epitome of \\"wintry music\\". After the aquatic soundscapes of 1999's \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\", Sigur Ros decided to take their new-age-meets-indie-rock sound in a completely different direction. They made \\"( )\\", an album sung in a made-up language, with no song titles, and next-to-no credits. And it worked pretty friggin' well, too!<br /><br />For an album with lyrics that no one will understand, (Isaro?) the vocals sure have variety. Jonsi can sing in a high pitched, alien falsetto, then suddenly change into a calm, understanding whisper, and yet again into Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke? (see \\"Untitled 7\\")<br /><br />The first half of the CD, \\"(\\" is definitely the superior half (although maybe that's just because I prefer Sigur Ros' softer side). \\"Untitled 2\\" conjures up slow, twinkling guitar riffs that sound like Hawaii during an ice-age, while \\"Untitled 3\\" repeats a lovely piano figure for over 5 minutes while slowly buliding tension, and releasing it in a slow, soft outro.<br /><br />The second half of the CD \\")\\" is alot more rock oriented than the rather ballad-y first half. \\"Untitled 5\\" is the epitome of a sad, lonely, beautiful night on the North Pole (or some other cold, remote place), and \\"Untitled 8\\" is 10+ minutes of slow, climatic rock with drumming that could blast your body apart. Unfortunately, there are some parts on the second half where the songs just don't evolve as much as they do on the first half, and \\"( )\\" occaisonally becomes boring because of it.<br /><br />This CD will definitely take some time to work it's magic. The songs on here all have extremely slow tempos, and an extensive focus on minimalism that will turn off most impatient listeners. But for tracks 1,2,3, and 5 make it worth the effort.<br /><br />Now...where the hell is Album 4? >.&lt;
B00009V8Z9|5.0|WOW!!! Gavin DeGraw is the best artist in the whole wide world.  You may not think  so yet because you might not have listened to the CD yet.  Well you have no idea what you're in for.  This is easily the best CD I have ever listened to.   <br />    Before I went to one of Gavin DeGraw's concerts I barely even knew who he was, but now he is one of my favorite singers of all time.  Once you listen to the CD you will defenitely be hooked.  Besides being such a great artist, he is a really down-to-earth person.  He is sooo nice and appreciates each and every one of his fans out there in the world.  He is a truly magnetic artist and I'm positive you won't be sorry if you buy this CD.   He has an amazing voice and also plays the piano and guitar.  He is a truly great musician.  So buy the CD now!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is again another example of why Fox sucks.  Great show that never had a chance.  Somehow, it still managed to get a huge fan base.  It's easy to see why.  Great show.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Just when Limp Bizkit started to actually seem like a good band with some potential and credible songwriting skills (after albums like 1999's \\"Significant Other\\"), they release \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" in 2000. I do not think this album, itself, was a sell-out, because a lot of bands make two albums and release them only one year apart from each other (does anyone remember Korn's \\"Issues\\" or \\"Take a Look in the Mirror?\\"), and some bands (like System of a Down) even release two albums in the same year! However, I do think releasing five singles (songs which are played on the radio) was a sell-out. Plus, I believe making one music video is OK- I don't think that's selling out- but Fred Durst made music videos for five songs, and he even made several videos for the same song (i.e. \\"Rollin'\\"). This was also a greedy move. So, Limp Bizkit did not sell-out just because they released this album (it was what they did after this album that deserves being called \\"selling-out\\").<br /><br />\\"Chocolate Starfish\\" has its high and low points, but it is ultimately not as terrible as everyone else is saying. Let me point out that nobody thought this album was bad until Wes Borland said they were a sell-out band (when he left the group in 2001). Now, I'm not an idiot, I know this isn't the smartest written piece of music you can find; but most of the songs are undeniably catchy and flat-out fun to listen to! And, generally, there is enough good guitar work to make up for the songs with stupid lyrics. So, this is a very uneven album with several hits and several misses. The best way the prove this to you is to give a rundown of every track...so here it is:<br /><br />1. Intro-This opening track has a weird robotic voice, which says things like \\"This is not a dream...this is reality.\\" This can be kind of trippy to listen to it, but it's just an short, pointless intro and it goes on too long. I always skip this track. Rating: 2/10.<br />2. Hot Dog- The first real song on this album sure makes an impression. Even though yelling the F word over 50 times on one song did what it was supposed to (draw a \\"buzz\\" around this album, and make it famous), everyone knows that this song's lyrics are pretty terrible. At one point, Fred even goes as far to boast that he's said the f word 46 times. Anybody who makes a boast like that can't be taken seriously and should probably be thought of as a self parody. Plus, it's hard to believe Fred's anger on \\"Hot Dog,\\" because it was written by the same guy who wrote such peaceful tracks as \\"Rearranged.\\" Fortunately, Wes Borland's guitars and DJ Lethal's turntables come through, making this track less than a complete disaster. Rating: 6/10.<br />3. My Generation- This is one of the two lead singles (Fred released two singles at the same time). This track has a great excitement and energy, and it is also quite catchy and fun to listen to. I enjoy the end, when DJ Lethal makes an appearance and does some fast scratching. Lyrically, this song is about blaming everything that's bad in this world on kids. These lyrics should appeal and be relatable to most teenagers. Rating: 8/10.<br />4. Full Nelson- A dark vibe runs throughout this one. The very violent and angry lyrics ultimately come across sounding repetitive and simple. This song is centered around the chorus: \\"You'll get knocked the f- out!,\\" and this is also the third track in a row to be completely focused on profanity. Nice, loud, lumbering guitar riffs, though. Rating: 5/10.<br />5. My Way- If you listen to the radio...you've heard this song. It's the first semi-ballad of the album, with OK lyrics (which are very depressing), an OK melody, and some OK guitar riffs. Rating: 8/10.<br />6. Rollin'- The second lead single. In the opening, Fred lamely addresses the listener as both \\"partner\\" and \\"baby.\\" Even I will admit this song is dumb, embarrassing, and pointless...but it's one of those tracks that gets by because it is just fun to listento. I'm not in love with this song, and it, even still, couldn't help but get stuck in my head. If there are any Limp Bizkit fans left, \\"Rollin'\\" should be a concert favorite and it should get the mosh pits swirling. It's a great song to get pumped up to. Rating: 6/10.<br />7. Livin' It Up- A throwaway track. Fred tries to make this a rap song, but its absolutely horrible lyrics, which don't even rhyme half the time, really drag it down. It also has another really lame boast (\\"I'm just a crazy motherf-er!\\") In all seriousness, this might be the worst rap-rock song ever! Rating: 0/10.<br />8. One- Another throwaway. It's an OK ballad with some OK melody, but this song is very out of place and Fred's singing is weak. Rating: 3/10.<br />9-Getcha Groove On- Features a cameo by Xzibit. Some OK rapping on this one, but this is also, ultimately, a rather unimpressive song. Rating: 6/10.<br />10. Take a Look Around- The theme to \\"Mission Impossible: 2\\" is also one of this album's best tracks. Even some Limp Bizkit haters will admit that this song has some of Fred's best and most mature lyrics (such as \\"Life is a lesson/you learn it when you're through\\"), and this song also has some great guitar and bass riffs. The end is calm and restrained, while Fred almost whispers, but then it explodes. I also enjoy the bobbing guitar riffs and drum beat near the end. Rating: 10/10.<br />11. It'll Be OK- An OK and very depressing track. I listened to it and was depressed for the rest of the night. This song's beginning and verses are ballad-esque, but the guitars eventually kick in and make it heavier. You should steer clear of this song if a) you are a suicidal, or b) you couldn't care less about Fred or his feelings. Rating: 7/10.<br />12. Boiler- A song which was probably written so Fred could rant and rage and get some things off his chest. The music and all around sound are OK on this one, but I just wish Fred would shut up. I like the ending, though, when an instrument that sounds like a piano makes an appearance. Rating: 6/10.<br />13. Hold On- Maybe the most mature, melodic, and best song on the album. It was produced -and features some guest vocals- by Scott Weiland. You may hate me for saying this, but there is actually some very good singing and lyrics on here. Rating: 10/10.<br />14. Rollin'- Features some guest rapping by DMX, Redman and Method Man. This dance club hit has some more OK rapping, with some new lyrics, but this remix of \\"Rollin'\\" isn't as catchy as track 6 (it's more annoying, too). Rating: 5/10.<br />15. Outro- An interview with Ben Stiller about what he likes about Limp Bizkit. The beginning of this skit is very pointless, but the end (which is Ben Stiller laughing maniacally and endlessly) is where it turns to one of the most annoying things I have ever heard! Rating: 0/10.<br /><br />Overall rating: 82/150.<br />Overall rating without the intro and outro: 80/130.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" has its moments, but is ultimately just a mediocre album. It is NOT a terrible album, but I CAN understand why some people would think that. Personally, this album kept me entertained for a few months, but I've more-or-less grown out of it. \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" should appeal to some people (i.e. angry teenagers) more than others, and if you're looking for a C.D. to get pumped up to, or if you want a C.D. to listen to when you're depressed, angry, or in a bad mood...this is for you.

0790730960|5.0|Batman Returns is a very dark and entertaining film. Danny Devito and Michael Keaton make good adversaries as the penguin and Batman.  This movie takes the darkness that was present in the first movie and turns it on turbo with even the music being so dark.  It was a great shame that this was to be the last great batman movie until Begins but it doesnt dissappoint.  The movie opens with a disturbing sequence of the penguins parents dumping their child into the sewer.  Then the credits roll with the entertaining Elman score and the movie picks up 33 years later.  And it is an action packed ride, with a major attack by penguins circus,  and a nice catwoman sequence as she destroys christopher walkens store,  battles between batman and catwoman create sexual tension between the two baddies and it is wierd to see them out of their costumes becoming a couple while they are trying to kill each other without knowing.  And a destructive sequence with the batmobile is a highlight but the major highlight is the finale as the penguin releases his penguins with missiles on their back and sends them to destroy gotham city.  All of this makes Batman Returns feel like a good sequel because it is bigger and better than the original. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good action flick.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Errol Morris is a GOD. No, I didn't say he's THE god, just A god. The man simply makes brilliant films. I think anyone who lived as an adult during the 1960s should flock to see this film. I didn't enjoy this movie as well as some of Mr. Morris' others (\\"Vernon, Florida\\" is, in my mind, one of the best documentaries ever), but it still rates 4 stars.  <br />
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is a brilliantly written, tightly paced show with dark, intricate storytelling and lots of humor. It gets a lot of comparisons to Buffy because its lead character is a tiny blonde teen who takes no prisoners and is always quick with a clever comeback, but in many ways VM is a more complex and intriguing show, and there are almost no \\"fight scenes\\" and no fantasy elements. Unlike Buffy, Veronica has no superpowers and knows she can't \\"kick butt\\" when she is trying to bring down the bad guys. She has only her intelligence and her wits to keep her ahead of the game. Plus, when the going gets rough, she has her trusty dog Backup to scare off the evildoers.  <br /> <br />Veronica is frequently described as a \\"modern day Nancy Drew,\\" but she is also much more than that. Yes, she does work for her private investigator dad tracking down missing persons and solving other mysteries both large and small, and her weapons of choice are modern-day tools like the internet, cell phones, and Lojack. But Veronica is not your typical peppy teenage girl. She is the anti-cheerleader, a very angry girl who is more likely to taunt her classmates with clever insults than to provide any cheer. While she does have her softer side, it's well hidden and she doesn't reveal it very often. She didn't always used to be this way, and the series takes it time exploring, via flashbacks, how Veronica used to be in the past and why she became so angry and isolated from her peers.  <br /> <br />If you have wanted to watch the show but have been put off by the \\"teen\\" angle, rest assured that there truly is something for everyone here, of any age. The writing is sophisticated and adult. These teens do things like quote Hamlet and make pop-culture references as widely varied as Heathers to Brigadoon, so the dialogue is frequently quippy and never boring. But the humor never takes over the entire show to make it too light, and the tone is pretty dark overall, considering that the underlying mystery driving Veronica for the entire season is finding the person who murdered her best friend Lilly Kane. Add to that some story lines involving rape, incest, and child abuse, and it's clear that this is no comedy. It's also not for children and sometimes tests the bounds of what you might see on network television in terms of the darkness of the subject matter. Drugs, alcohol, and sex are portrayed as a fact of life among teenagers and the show is not moralizing or preachy in any way, although it frequently portrays the sometimes tragic consequences of all of the above.  <br /> <br />Kristen Bell is astonishingly good as Veronica, but the entire cast is for the most part pretty first-rate, especially Enrico Colantoni (as her dad Keith Mars) and Jason Dohring (as her arch-nemesis Logan Echolls). If you are a fan of twisty ongoing mysteries like Lost or Twin Peaks, or you enjoy the quippy humor of the Gilmore Girls or the O.C., or even if you like old-fashioned detective stories like Columbo or the Rockford Files, give Veronica Mars a try because it truly combines the best of all of the above. And if you are a guy, Kristen Bell is pretty darn cute, to boot. So there's that, too.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I always find it amusing how a lot of christians will listen to non-christian music and still gain an appreciation for it but quite a few non-christian folk fail to approach christian music in the same way. <br /> <br />I'm Australian so I didn't grow up with the popular American \\"christianity\\" (if you want to call right wing authoritative government with high endorsement of executions, despite the fact that it's said in the bible 'thou shalt not kill' on several occassions, \\"christians\\"). <br /> <br />Being a converted christian myself (exploring things a lot and shifting from my agnostic views in high school) I've since noticed a total lack in good christian music and I'm so tired of the hillsong-like happy dappy lame meaningless carbon copy crap that's manufactured by apathetic followers. <br /> <br />So many christian bands not only sound the same but their lyrics are about as thoughtful as \\"Jesus is alright.\\" Apart from \\"jars of clay\\" and \\"five iron frenzy\\" I've found it hard to find appealing christian bands that provoke thought and stir emotion.  <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of music and always I'll listen for good song writing before good lyric writing. Hence I'm into a lot of nonchristian bands (way a lot more than christian music). I'm cool with that because I can usually relate to the lyrics regardless of whatever differences there are between the artist and myself. However being a christian I also feel a need for fellowship and solidarity. I want to relate on a spiritual level because of the importance God has in my life. <br /> <br />So I was pretty stoked to hear Sufjan on radio station JJJ along with all my fav. nonchristian bands. I didn't originally know he was a christian and went and bought \\"seven swans\\" finding out later on who he was. <br /> <br />The difference I think between stevens and a lot of other christian music is that it appeals to nonchristians too. Apart from awesome music I don't think the lyrics exclude those that aren't christians from appreciating the songs on another level. <br /> <br />I get that after years of bible bashing you might be feeling a bit sore about christians (and who can blame you; I don't think I'd have responded to a forceful approach). But if you hear a lot of other christian music you'll find stevens is really quite unique and rather than saying \\"turn to Christ\\" in every line he spends more time reflecting on the importance of God in his own life; which I reckon is more humble and more inteligent. <br /> <br />That said I'm excited about the new album. It's quite a musical masterpiece and it sucks that he's so underrated. I hope people will listen to more of this and shut off the crap we keep hearing from \\"destiny's child\\", \\"50 cent\\" and other rubbish bands that sooner exploit their own bodies than throughtfully compose deep lyrics. <br /> <br />It's hard to explain what style stevens uses. It's folkly but he doesn't fall into the 'lull' sound a lot of folk music comes up with. <br /> <br />Have a listen, buy the album and enjoy the thought provoking lyrics (despite whether or not you're a christian). <br /> <br />
B0007OCG56|5.0|The first thing you need to know about Spanglish is that it is not a comedy; it is a drama with bits of humor spread throughout its two plus hours' running time.  Adam Sandler is not the main focus of the film, nor is he the kind of boisterous character we are so used to seeing; he is, in fact, exceedingly mellow and serious here.  Spanglish is really all about the boundaries of culture, economic standing, and social circles, centering on a Mexican mother who brings her daughter to America and spends several life-changing months working for a rich restaurant chef and his increasingly insane wife.  This film has heart, and it has it in spades.<br /><br />Paz Vega (who is, I have to say, absolutely gorgeous) plays Flor Moreno, a young mother who comes to America to give her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) the best life possible.  Not knowing a word of English, she works two jobs to make ends meet - until she accepts a housekeeping job with the Clasky family.  The Claskys are not exactly normal.  The husband, John (Adam Sandler), is a wildly successful chef who always seems to be in sort of a fog, while the wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a narcissistic woman with an ever-growing number of neuroses and an almost infinite capacity to annoy.  Their daughter needs the kind of support that Deborah seems incapable of providing, while their son must have been put in the film as a favor to someone important because he serves no purpose whatsoever in the story.  Cloris Leachman shines as Deborah's wise mother who has plenty of advice to give based on her own mistakes.<br /><br />Things are going OK until the family rents a summer cottage on the beach, and Flor and Cristina move in.  Suddenly, Cristina is given access to a world she has never known, and Deborah is particularly brazen about giving things to Cristina that Flor could never afford - even a scholarship to a swanky private school.  John makes his own mistakes with Cristina and her mother, but he and Flor eventually develop what he might call a simpatico relationship.  Deborah eventually becomes quite out of control, basically treating Cristina as her own daughter.  Even as she is being isolated and alienated by Deborah, Flor begins drawing closer to John.  Through it all, though, she makes all of her decisions based on her daughter's best interests.<br /><br />I thought Spanglish was just an outstanding film.  It may have gone a little far in terms of turning the audience completely against Deborah (Tea Leoni, I might add, seems to age about thirty years over the course of this film), but the central message of the film comes through loud and clear.  You don't exactly close the book on these characters when the movie ends, as there is some ambiguity involved with the conclusion, but that seems quite fitting here.  I thought Adam Sandler was terrific, but his casting for the role of John Clasky is a bit of a two-edged sword.  Some Sandler fans will come to Spanglish expecting another extreme comedy and be surprised if not disappointed, while other viewers may turn away from the film because they assume it is another typical Sandler vehicle.  I hope this movie continues to get the attention it deserves from all audiences, though, as it really is a wonderfully made film that tells an emotionally poignant story.ally develop what he might call a simpatico relationship.

B00005JN2Z|3.0|I'm not so much a fan of Tom Cruise. Mainly because I haven't seen him in anything that was impressive since \\"Born on the 4th of July.\\" Still, his performance in this film was very good. Tom plays the killer-for-hire, Vincent, who kidnaps Jamie Foxx's taxi driver character, Max, and gets him to drive him to all 5 of the hits he must do in one night. The main problem critics had with it was that they were unable to suspend their disbelief. I disagree to a point. I could believe the taxi driver kidnap point, and the attempts Max makes to escape point, and the blood thirstiness of Vincent point. It was the end, when Max rescues Jada Pinkett Smith that I think the movie lost its edge.
B000957O82|4.0|From the Scene One in which Will Smith with his easygoing charms directly talks to us viewers, we know where the film is going.  Will Smith is Alex Hitchens, \\"date doctor\\" who gives tips for males to arrange the dates with the opposite sex.  And believe it or not, every \\"client\\" is satisfied with his job.   <br /> <br />The film has two stories, both of which are not particularly original, but told with a delightful touch and considerable energy.  In one, Alex himself falls in love with a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes), who strictly guards herself against unwelcome males coming to her.  But of course, Alex is an exception -- his persistent wooing (even using walkie-talkie)is so irreisitible.  <br /> <br />In the other, we find more unique story and talents -- Alex is given a hard task, as hard as Mission Impossible.  That is, to guide one accountant Albert (Kevin James) successfully to his goal -- a date with a celebrity, beautiful and (very) rich female Allegra (Amber Valletta).  The big problem is, Albert, so smitten, so good-natured, so timid, cannot do one single right thing even while having a lunch, kind of a guy who drops fried potatoes onto the floor, and kicks a can of coke while picking up them.  It seems Albert (and a terrible dancer too) is totally a hopeless case, but Alex Hitchens knows what to do.   <br /> <br />The direction of Andy Tennant ('Ever After') is a strange mixture of slapsticks, witty dialogues, and romantic mood.  The tone is inconsistent, but that doesn't bother us.  The story is predictable, and the ending is very weak, but still the characters, or the actors, are all charming.  And very funny and likable Kevin James as Albert steals almost every scene in the film. <br /> <br />Probably, however, the best part of the film is the location itself, well-chosen spots in New York City.  A bit familiar as romantic comedy perhaps, but very cute 'Hitch' with equally cute characters reminds us that this city is and will be a beloved place for every film lover.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This is my ultimate favorite movie-story.It's just beautiful. Starting with the characters, they are such likable people,people one might wish to know in real life. <br />The cinamatography is wonderful! Each scene is a piece of artwork in motion. The dance scenes are enchanting . <br /> I've probably watched this film 20+ times. Because it  impresses the importance of honest friendship.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I was very excited about the release of X&Y , hoping it'll be a classic like U2's 'Where the Streets Have No Name' or Radiohead's 'Ok Computer' but unfortunately it's doesn't come no where near those albums. The lyrics written on the are the worst of the 3 albums they've released so far. Most of the songs seem stagnant,bland,and very very whiny basically to the point where it becomes irritating. Musically in some songs ('Square One','White Shadow',and maybe 'Fix You') Coldplay's has made some progression from their last album. Hopefully Chris Martin&Co. can make a better album, because they do have the potential. Don't get me wrong this album is decent when compared to the Popular music of today, but when comparing to the first two albums \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", \\"X&Y\\" disappoints.
B000148KK2|4.0|Man-o-man, Ms. Krall's voice is sooooooooo smooth. I honestly can't think of a better Jazz vocalist around today than her. This new collection draws very little on the jazz standards of previous collections. Instead, many of the songs are written by the artist and her husband, Elvis Costello (didn't know he had it in him!). They SOUND jazz standard-y, but they're not. And, oh, they're good. I especially like the first tune \\"Stop This World.\\" She's also great on her jazz interpretation of the blues song \\"Love Me Like a Man.\\"  <br />
6305736650|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Each scene is fascinatingly complex and elegant.  The stoic Humphrey Bogart is unforgettable.  I love the middle eastern influence throughout.  I see this movie at least four times a year and it always transports me to another era.
0679745203|3.0|I pretty much liked this book - it was better than some I've read - and, as we all know, the dude has his style down pat, all poetry and dreaminess, a sense of the story floating around and through you, like some mist, or a fog.  But it doesn't really grab you; it meanders here and there, exploring different characters, different back stories, different tangents, but without following any one of them to a satisfying conclusion.  The one meaty, suspenseful issue - the matter of the English patient's identity - is built up to for some time, but then brushed off with hardly a passing thought.  It would have been nice to have been hooked, to have had something hit home, rather than have it always swooning about you, looking pretty but not really meaning anything.  Still, it did earn the dude a chunk of money and fame; he won't be wanting for work again!    Now tell me - does he have sex with her after she's dead?  I rather think he might...
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I don't understand. Most of the negative reviews this album has here present this release as something so non-Dream Theater that it's bad. Some of the critics dare to compare each song to other group's styles. They've mentioned Korn, U2, even Journey...WHAT ABOUT DREAM THEATER?. Why is it that, for me, all the songs reminded me of a part of the history of Dream Theater?. I mean, if the songs should sound so much like they could have been performed by somebody else (meaning, lack of originality), why those who critize now didn't notice before?.  Well, I think it's because they don't know Dream Theater well. Maybe they liked their 2 last studio albums a lot, that they find the new product to be \\"light\\". But the true DT fan know better.  I wouldn't say that this is a \\"back to the roots\\" project, but it's more coming back over the group's own footsteps:  The first 4 songs could have been placed in the \\"Falling into infinity\\" CD, with \\"Walk beside you\\" being the commercial \\"black sheep\\" in this record (but don't all the DT's CDs have at least one radio friendly song???). \\"Panic Attack\\" and \\"Never enough\\" preserve the sound that we heard in the latest releases, \\"Six degrees\\" and \\"Train of thought\\". \\"Sacrificed sons\\" reminded me of the \\"Scenes from a memory\\" CD. And \\"Octavarium\\" is a combination of 4 parts that resembles \\"Change of seasons\\", and has clear influences of Pink Floyd and Genesis (nothing bad about it).  Overall, the quality of the lyrics is what you'd expect from a DT cd, nothing less. The sound quality is the usual DT production.  The chorus of the 3rd part of Octavarium, for me, says a lot about this album: \\"leaning over, crawling up, stumblin' all around, losing my place, only to find I've come full circle\\". Yes, my friends, with this release DT show that maybe they have gone as far as they can, and from now on, they will sound just like Dream Theater, no evolution, no surprises. They have evolved, then try to find their sound, only to come full circle. Ormaybe it's just a temporary stop to look behind for a while. For those, like me, who find they were losing their way (stumblin' all around) after the excellent \\"Scenes from a memory\\", Octavarium is a good sign.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|At first I didn't know what to think about this band since there was so much hype around them.  But once I actually sat down and listened to the album, I truly started to see their beauty.   <br /> <br />There is a sense of urgency and honesty in the music.  Something that I haven't heard in a long time.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album to everyone.  I was very pleasantly surprised (for once) from a band with a lot of hype.
B00009P1O2|5.0|this DVD isn't bad for four aging queens, freddie is in fine form, even though he had a bit more trouble with his voice than usual, but still put on a tremendous show, brian was equally brilliant, it's amazing how loved this band was in their home town. my fav bits are 'who wants to live forever,' 'impromtu' and 'a kind of magic,' actually the whole show is great. also check out a slightly younger queen on 'live at the bowl' and 'we will rock you' dvds, you will find freddie in even a stronger voice.
074322454X|5.0|Band of Brothers is a wonderful book full of great information and real life experiences from WWII. I loved this book and if are intrigued by war like i am you will love the book too. I have found 2 books written by David Webster, a main character from the book, if you want to see them search \\"David Webster\\" on Amazon. Two big thumbs up for Band of Brothers.
B00006RCSR|5.0|No one, but no one can play a Cinderella-like character quite like Drew Barrymore. She absolutely shines in this role, in this movie. Previous fairy tale princesses have always had to wait for teir prince to rescue them, yet the tale of a would-be princess who saves herself is made in such belivable fashion that the innovation is readily forgivable. One question: why wasn't Ms. Barrymore nominated for the Academy Award as best actress in that year??<br /><br />That aside, the other actors and actresses did a great job, particularly Anjelica Houston, who plays a particularly villanous stepmother. The music is also very good (hint, hint).
B00070Q7VO|2.0|When you do songs that are associated with classic artists such as Frank Sinatra, you should at least try to surpass and transcend what came before.  Mr. Buble really does not succeed. There are too many uncomfortable sequences within songs, where I felt he was \\"walking through it\\", rather than selling it.  The album does have a shining moment.  \\"You and I\\", known only to me as sung by Barbra Streisand, is a masterpiece of phrasing and restraint; what a cut!
0393317552|4.0|Certainly, there needs to be more books like Guns, Germs, and Steel.  The meta-history perspective of the book is refreshing.  However, I can see how many historians and social scientists may have problems with Jared Diamond's approach.  While Diamond accurately depicts the cogs of the mechanisms of history, he is less convincing that the big cogs will outweigh the smaller ones given enough time.  History has shown that accidents and unintended consequences have changed its course many a time.  Furthermore, as a small peeve, I did not like how he didn't attribute some of his most celebrated theses to its proper authors.  He takes a lot of very well known geographical concepts, like the contintental axes, and fails to cite them.  However, this is minor because it is supposed to be well known, at least to geographers.  I could see how many people might think he thought of it himself, given that geography (not just capitals and countries, but the political, environmental, and cultural elements of human activity in spatial dimensions) is rarely taught in colleges nowadays. <br />Overall, this is a good book, and there needs to be more books with the same ambition, but perhaps more originality.
080019683X|5.0|This one is to be shared by kids and grown-ups alike. One thing: if buying in VHS format, get the English-language version, not the Spanish-dubbed one. If you hear both soundtracks, the reason will become obvious.
B00082IJ08|5.0|<br /> <br />Damon Albarn went to great pains to explain that the first Gorillaz album was a collaboration between him, cartoonist Jamie Hewlett, and producer Dan the Automator, but any sort of pretense to having the virtual pop group seem like a genuine collaborative band was thrown out the window for the group's long-awaited 2005 sequel, Demon Days. Hewlett still provides new animation for Gorillaz -- although the proposed feature-length film has long disappeared -- but Dan the Automator is gone, leaving Albarn as the unquestioned leader of the group. This isn't quite similar to Blur, a genuine band that faltered after Graham Coxon decided he had enough, leaving Damon behind to construct the muddled Think Tank largely on his own. No, Gorillaz were always designed as a collective, featuring many contributors and producers, all shepherded by Albarn, the songwriter, mastermind, and ringleader.  <br /> <br />Hiding behind Hewlett's excellent cartoons gave Albarn the freedom to indulge himself, but it also gave him focus since it tied him to a specific concept. Throughout his career, Albarn always was at his best when writing in character -- to the extent that anytime he wrote confessionals in Blur, they sounded stagy -- and Gorillaz not only gave him an ideal platform, it liberated him, giving him the opportunity to try things he couldn't within the increasingly dour confines of Blur. It wasn't just that the cartoon concept made for light music -- on the first Gorillaz album, Damon sounded as if he were having fun for the first time since Parklife.  <br /> <br />But 2005 is a much different year than 2001, and if Gorillaz exuded the heady, optimistic, future-forward vibes of the turn of the millennium, Demon Days is as theatrically foreboding as its title, one of the few pop records made since 9/11 that captures the eerie unease of living in the 21st century. Not really a cartoony feel, in other words, but Gorillaz indulged in doom and gloom from their very first single, \\"Clint Eastwood,\\" so this is not unfamiliar territory, nor is it all that dissimilar from the turgid moodiness of Blur's 2003 Think Tank. But where Albarn seemed simultaneously constrained and adrift on that last Blur album -- attempting to create indie rock, yet unsure how since messiness contradicts his tightly wound artistic impulses -- he's assured and masterful on Demon Days, regaining his flair for grand gestures that served him so well at the height of Britpop, yet tempering his tendency to overreach by keeping the music lean and evocative through his enlistment of electronica maverick Danger Mouse as producer.  <br /> <br />Demon Days is unified and purposeful in a way Albarn's music hasn't been since The Great Escape, possessing a cinematic scope and a narrative flow, as the curtain unveils to the ominous, morose \\"Last Living Souls\\" and then twists and winds through valleys, detours, and wrong paths -- some light, some teeming with dread -- before ending up at the haltingly hopeful title track. Along the way, cameos float in and out of the slipstream and Albarn relies on several familiar tricks: the Specials are a touchstone, brooding minor key melodies haunt the album, there are some singalong refrains, while a celebrity recites a lyric (this time, it's Dennis Hopper). Instead of sounding like musical crutches, this sounds like an artist who knows his strengths and uses them as an anchor so he can go off and explore new worlds.  <br /> <br />Chief among the strengths that Albarn relies upon is his ability to find collaborators who can articulate his ideas clearly and vividly. Danger Mouse, whose Grey Album mash-up of the Beatles and Jay-Z was an underground sensation in 2004, gives this music an elasticity and creeping darkness than infects even such purportedly lighthearted moments as \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" It's a sense of menace that's reminiscent of prime Happy Mondays, so it shouldn't be a surprise that one of the highlights of Demon Days is Shaun Ryder's cameo on the tight, deceptively catchy \\"Dare.\\" Over a tightly wound four minutes, \\"Dare\\" exploits Ryder's iconic Mancunian thug persona within territory that belongs to the Gorillaz -- its percolating beat not too far removed from \\"19/2000\\" -- and that's what makes it a perfect distillation of Demon Days: by letting other musicians take center stage and by sharing credit with Danger Mouse, Damon Albarn has created an allegedly anonymous platform whose genius ultimately and quite clearly belongs to him alone.  <br /> <br />All the themes and ideas on this album have antecedents in his previous work, but surrounded by new collaborators, he's able to present them in a fresh, exciting way. And he has created a monster album here -- not just in its size, but in its Frankenstein construction. It not only eclipses the first Gorillaz album, which in itself was a terrific record, but stands alongside the best Blur albums, providing a tonal touchstone for this decade the way Parklife did for the '90s. While it won't launch a phenomenon the way that 1994 classic did -- Albarn is too much a veteran artist for that and the music is too dark and weird -- Demon Days is still one hell of a comeback for Damon Albarn, who seemed perilously close to forever disappearing into his own ego.
B00014NE62|5.0|I really love all of the Merchant Ivory production's, and Maurice is them at their peak!  It is a sweeping drama, with all of the prerequisite E.M. Forster touches, so beautifully captured by Merchant Ivory.  The actors are first rate, the music amazing, and the atmosphere just draws you completely into the story. Unforgettable!
B00005LMBK|5.0|<br />It's tempting to judge Gorillaz -- Damon Albarn, Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, and Dan \\"The Automator\\" Nakamura's virtual band -- just by their brilliantly animated videos and write the project off as another triumph of style over substance. Admittedly, Hewlett's edgy-cute characterizations of 2-D, Gorillaz' pretty boy singer (who looks a cross between the Charlatans' Tim Burgess and Sonic the Hedgehog), sinister bassist Murdoc, whiz-kid guitarist Noodle, and b-boy drummer Russel are so arresting that they almost detract from Gorillaz' music.  <br /> <br />The amazing \\"Thriller\\"-meets-Planet of the Apes clip for \\"Clint Eastwood\\" is so visually clever that it's easy to take the song's equally clever, hip-hop-tinged update of the Specials' \\"Ghost Town\\" for granted. And initially, Gorillaz' self-titled debut feels incomplete when Hewlett's imagery is removed; the concept of Gorillaz as a virtual band doesn't hold up as well when you can't see the virtual bandmembers. It's too bad that there isn't a DVD version of Gorillaz, with videos for every song,  la the DVD version of Super Furry Animals' Rings Around the World.  <br /> <br />Musically, however, Gorillaz is a cutely caricatured blend of Albarn's eclectic Brit-pop and Nakamura's equally wide-ranging hip-hop, and it sounds almost as good as the band looks. Albarn has fun sending up Blur's cheeky pop on songs like \\"5/4\\" and \\"Re-Hash,\\" their trip-hop experiments on \\"New Genious\\" and \\"Sound Check,\\" and \\"Song 2\\"-like thrash-pop on \\"Punk\\" and \\"M1 A1.\\"  <br /> <br />Despite the similarities between Albarn's main gig and his contributions here, Gorillaz isn't an Albarn solo album in disguise; Nakamura's bass- and beat-oriented production gives the album an authentically dub and hip-hop-inspired feel, particularly on \\"Rock the House\\" and \\"Tomorrow Comes Today.\\" Likewise, Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Miho Hatori, and Ibrahim Ferrer's vocals ensure that it sounds like a diverse collaboration rather than an insular side project. Instead, it feels like a musical vacation for all parties involved -- a little self-indulgent, but filled with enough fun ideas and good songs to make this virtual band's debut a genuinely enjoyable album.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Luc Besson' is as much an artist as a director.  The Big Blue is one of the most visually stunning films that I have ever seen!  From the brilliant black & white opening sequence, to the amazing underwater scenes, and the homage to the beauty of the mediteranean sea, every image was a perfect picture.  The story was simple but moving, the lead actors did a great job, the locations where stunning, but without a doubt the real star of this film was it's director, Luc Besson. I have recommended this film to everyone I know in the visual arts, it is not to be missed.
B00004BZ16|5.0|This album is the ultimate treasure hunt and with today's technology you can create your own treasure.  The CD I created makes a great double album and not a single like everyone else gets.  This is because I spent time with this album and have discovered great tracks I missed years later like \\"Version City\\" the opener from side 6.  I don't even like \\"Magnifecent Seven\\" like everyone else does.  To me this has tons of incredible classic songs that I could not live without.  They are as follows: \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\", \\"Sound Of Sinners\\", \\"Something About England\\", \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\", \\"Up In Heaven\\", \\"The Leader\\", \\"Kingston's Advice\\", \\"Police On My Back\\", \\"Washington Bullets\\", \\"The Call Up\\", \\"Ivan Meets GI Joe\\", \\"Lose This Skin\\", \\"Hitsville UK\\", \\"One More Time\\" and \\"Let's Go Crazy\\". These are all A+ tracks.  Just below this are a lot of entertaining tracks like, \\" <br />\\"Street Parade\\", \\"Version City\\", \\"Midnight Log\\", \\"Corner Soul\\", \\"Broadway\\", \\"If Music Could Talk\\", and the kiddie version of \\"Career Oppurtunities\\".  I do agree the dubs and instrumentals are crap, but even the rest like \\"Rebel Waltz\\" isn't terrible.  This is an album I love more each day. It has given me the best treasure hunt ever with the resulting CD being one of the best albums I have ever made. I'm sure your results will vary, but anyone looking for music that will reward them time after time should pick this embarrassment of riches up right away.

I laughed and felt embarrassed for the character.  It is about a girl who is going back home on an air plane and thinks its going to crash, so she tells all her secrets to a man sitting next to her who she doesn't know.  He turns out to be her boss the next time she appears at work. If you want a light hearted comedy, definitely pick this book up.   <br /> <br />

B000000993|5.0|Well maybe reading the heading you would see that Tool is my favorite band and good reason why, they came out with Sober and I was hooked.  <br /> <br />Well many people might label Tool nu-metal simply because Tool came out near the start of nu-metal but Tool came out 2 years before. Another thing is, it doesn't sound a thing like nu-metal. no rapping, no downtuned guitars, and no self pity lyrics(read the music first). These songs are very psychedelic and hypnotising, the type of music you can get lost to. Maynard James Keenan has a voice that Vilo Varnis(whatever his name is from HIM) wishrd he had his style, voice, ability to freak out people, and his popularity in and respect in the metal community. Adam jones has some killer riffs,
B000957O82|4.0|Will Smith stars in this movie as Alex Hitchens, a suave, smooth- talking fellow who knows his business and performs it well.

He helps shy, awkward men find dates by coaching them on the right things to say and the right gestures to make. He is convinced that a man can get any woman if he follows the rules.<br /><br />Smith is the star of this movie, and he fits the part very well. It doesn't hurt that he has a fine supporting cast to back him up, including the likes of Kevin James, Eva Mendes, and Amber Valletta. I felt they all played their respective roles quite nicely, although I did find Eva Mendes character a little annoying after a while. On the other hand, Mendes is the one person who provides some suspense. She is a gossip columnist and the love interest of Will Smith. She isn't completely stable and she has erected an emotional fence when it comes to men. You don't really know what she is going to do from one scene to the next, and this makes her character a little more entertaining.<br /><br />What I like best about Hitch is that it gets you thinking about certain issues about dating, attraction, and ethics. Smith's character is convinced that a man can get the woman of his dreams, even if he isn't very good looking in comparison. There is some truth to this. I don't think any man can get any woman, but it is generally easier for a man with average or below average looks to get a girl who looks better than the other way around. Also, as Smith's character points out near the end, he only provides a catalyst for his clients to get the woman they want. What he is doing is ethical because it is the client himself that is really doing the work. If a relationship isn't meant to be, then no amount of coaching will help.<br /><br />One thing that I didn't like about this movie occurred near the beginning when Smith talked directly to the camera. Unless a film is a documentary, I don't think it's a good idea to have the actors and actresses talk to the camera, like they know a film is being made. Besides that, I think the pacing could have been picked up a little bit in places, too. But overall, \\"Hitch\\" still ranks as a good, entertaining motion picture. The performances and the messages it sends about dating make it worth a look.when Smith talked directly to the camera.

B000002H97|5.0|This album is a classic, Idon't know what are people's negative views on this album.The songs are still heavy and great.Enter Sandman was honestly the first song i heard from Metallica almost 13 or 14 years ago and it still sounds good as the first time I heard it.This album is a classic metal album even though people thought they sold out just because it is the most successful metal album of all time.
1565847032|5.0|When I brought this book I assumed that the term 'indespensable' would mean that it would be a collection of excerpts of his writing - rather it is a collection of transcripts of public forum discussion. The results were unputdownable for me as they have the air of having Noam Chomsky over for a chat over the dinner table and serve as an immensely accessible and unpretentious introduction to his thinking - by that virtue alone this definitely deserves to be called truly indespensible.  <br /> <br />The chosen transcripts are all so carefully chosen and thoughtfully editorialised as to represent his views on the widest possible range of issues. There will be something in this for everyone as a consequence, with everything here having as much or even more immediate relevancy to our post-9/11 times as it did when first published. The rise and fall of the Soviet Union, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the real meaning of the Watergate incident, the Middle East conflict, the need for enviromental reform - these and so many things are covered in a dazzling tour de force of thought. Chomsky bravely says things with aplomb that nobody else would dare to say - in case you too ended up knowing too much.  <br /> <br />This is a book that makes so much in our age seem so much more transparent, when the media has become a tool of the political propaganda machinery linked as it is to the moguls of their industry. It is scarcely possible to see any event in the last 80+ years of world history in the same light, such is the revelatory nature of the thought presented here that literally makes the scales fall from your eyes. <br /> <br />Subsequently this book has encouraged me to read other of his writings but I am immensely pleased that I started here. I have also lent this book to others - and judging by the postive responses I have had I doubt I am going to see it back for a very long time. I unconditionally recommend this book with whole-hearted enthusiasm and think anyone wouldfind something personally affecting here. This is a book that truly everyone should read just to empower themselves with the ability to see through so much politically driven mass media distortion (my euphemism for propaganda) that we are all so thoroughly saturated in.
B000002N2Z|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite bands>The guitar work is great, good bass lines and Abe C. is an awesome drummer.Chino's vocal skills are great.This album starts with Bored which is on my top 5 songs of alltime.one weak, minus blindfold and engine number 9 are other great tracks.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|now, granted this is a really short album, it has good songs and it shows a lil more maturity with some punk influence in it, evident in some songs, maybe i'm the only one that picked up on the punk influence, i dunno but i like the cd...it has its down moments in radio/video and old school hollywood bu.... upsides far outweight the downs.  like Question!  is a better song, simple yet elegant.  B.Y.O.B is a great anti-war song that is one of the harder ones on the cd.  Cigaro, which many people don't realize and i didn't until i read the lyrics, is talking about the armenian genocide which is a part of their heritage...just read the lyrics, ya'all will know what i'm talking about. and sad statue is one of the better songs also with a catchy chorus and catchy riffs leaving this cd not as good as toxicity or their selftitled, but still great in it's respects...just hope hypnotize will be longer....
B00001ZULV|2.0|Oh My God. If I want to listen to this kind of crap, I'll buy a Phil Collins album. This has got to be the worst collection of Genesis music I have ever seen. Firstly, There is only one original Genesis on here (I Know What I like [In Your Wardrobe] ) from back in the day. The only other song from real Genesis is the remake of \\"Carpet Crawlers.\\" Secondly, all of this stuff on this album is pop. Genesis was Progressive Rock. There are only two songs from the Peter Gabriel era on there. The rest are all Phil Collins trash; poppy, irritating, and bland. Each song from the Collins time is predictable and distasteful. It's for stupid people who do not have the time to analyze songs. I suppose if you want to listen to Genesis' mainstream attempt at fame, this is the album for you. However, if you want THE REAL GENESIS, consider buying \\"Foxtrot,\\" \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,\\" \\"Selling England by the Pound,\\" and others BEFORE THE PHIL  COLLINS ERA!!
B00003CXCD|5.0|William Wyler's (\\"Wuthering Heights,\\" \\"The Best Years Of Our Lives,\\" \\"Mrs. Miniver,\\" \\"Ben-Hur,\\" etc) adaptation of a magnificent screenplay by the then-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo (\\"Spartacus\\") is masterful in every way. With star performances by an inexperienced, but beautiful, actress named Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck (\\"Gentleman's Agreement\\") and Eddie Albert, the film went on to win Ms. Hepburn the Oscar for Best Actress (and well deserved, too!!) I won't rehash the plot, except to say that it provides plenty of opportunity for comic relief from Ms. Hepburn (best-known as \\"My Fair Lady\\"), Gregory Peck (who would win his own Oscar several years later for a compelling performance as Atticus Finch in the big-screen adaptation of Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" [see my review of the BOOK]) and Eddie Albert (who would go on to acheive lasting fame in a comedy show that I can't remember the name of). THIS is what movies were made of: great stories, good actors (where NO ONE HAD TO GET NAKED) and beautiful music. Mind, I like the movies they make nowadays, but I prefer the classics (\\"Gone With The Wind,\\" Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh's versions of \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"Henry V,\\" Sir Laurence Olivier's masterful \\"Richard III,\\" \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" \\"Casablanca,\\" \\"Gentleman's Agreement,\\" \\"To Have And Have Not,\\" \\"Dial 'M' For Murder,\\" \\"To Catch A Thief,\\" \\"Ben-Hur,\\" \\"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner,\\" \\"The Wizard Of Oz,\\" \\"The Music Man,\\" \\"The King And I,\\" \\"The Sound Of Music,\\" etc). This film is Not Rated.
B0009353IW|5.0|Now this is more like it... Several of the tunes are very different from Cooder's non-soundtrack music and we get a chance to hear his producer/arranger's mind in a new context. I especially liked the structure and harmonies of the first tune. The chords in the final section are reminiscent of the very sweet and funky East LA music from the late 60's and early 70's that I remember hearing on the radio as a kid.  Some of the voicings are identical to some of Bill Evans' harmonies too, believe or not. The reference to the common refrain in Cuban music, \\"vamos pa'l monte\\" is kinda cool, too. <br /> <br />The tunes in Spanish shouldn't present any problem for any gringos who can read the English translations. Maybe the folks who have complained about the Spanish lyrics have don't want to bother reading the songs in English. I don't agree with the other reviewer who complained about the text and vocals on \\"El UFO Cayo\\". This piece I find very moving both musically and lyrically. As a 3rd generation native southern Californian I can easily identify with the import of this song and I support the remarks of the other reviewers who share my background. Maybe a person must experience the type of \\"development\\" that completely destroys a way of life to understand this song properly. <br /> <br />Lalo Guerrero was wonderful on this disc. A huge personality and a great expressive and rambunctious singer. The lyrics and performance on \\"Viejo Barrio\\" are heartbreaking in this context. \\"Pachuco Suaves\\" rocks. It was also exciting to hear the Commagere sisters again after their contributions to \\"Mambo Sinuendo\\". They are super effective on \\"Chinito\\" and on the background vocals. I can't get enough of 'em. The vocals on \\"El UFO Cayo\\" are gorgeous; beautiful technique and expression, and the lyrics, again, are sad, dry, resigned and very hip. If people don't get it, I feel sorry for them. <br /> <br />The arrangement on \\"3 Cool Cats\\" is funky and airtight. These are some really good performances by these musicians. Willie G does his thing to perfection here. The lovely melody on \\"In my room\\" and Cooder's cranky singing work really well with the restrained guitar and the lyrical and atmospheric piano. It is an effective shift in the programming, too.  <br /> <br />It is very good to hear Ry and Flaco Jimenez playing conjunto again. What rich and beautiful accordian playing. In fact, all the Chicano music is excellent, unsurprising since this disc features such important and historic musicians. <br />  <br />There are many other high points in this disc. I think many people react to music that is slightly unfamiliar or new by immediately rejecting it. This is kinda dumb. If you take the time to actually listen to what the record tries to achieve (rather than just immediately react) maybe you'll find something good in it. In any case, this is an excellent effort, with very imaginative and effective lyrics, interesting and superb music and great performances.

034537410X|5.0|This is the definitive book on teaching yourself how to lucid dreaming... hands down. Very informative book on the nature of sleep and dreaming. <br />After reading the first chapter and letting your imagination flow, you'll get so pumped to start seriously practicing LaBerge's exercises and techniques. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, learning how to lucid dream is demanding for most. It takes hard work and motivation, you really need the urge to learn. <br /> <br />After approximately 2 weeks of solid effort I had my first true lucid dream, not only that but it lasted around 3-4 minutes which is actually really long for a beginner. It was an indescribable experience I'll never forget.. I woke up from that nap completely overwhelmed by excitement of what I had just done. <br /> <br />GET THIS BOOK
B000054OTY|5.0|UNTIL the release of a restored version S.E  from PLATINUM DISC CORP.!!!  It is digitally mastered -- mostly good+ resolution -- and is WIDESCREEN, even though it doesn't say so on the cover of its package! (At least mine is, as was that of whichever other reviewer who recommended this editon and whose advice I followed.  I, however, had to spend ~15 minutes clicking until I found the right version, so...!?)     This IS a great western!!  The moment, where he calls Ben Johnson \\"out\\" (so to speak), at the end of his recuperation ~mid-film is one of the most electrifying moments on film. (imho)  I have no idea what are the rights issues re: this film, nor what was his vision vs the studio cut, nor whether Brando even liked it, ftm; he apparently didn't like directing (and/or being under a studio thumb) all that much!?  Anyway, it's truly unfortunate that an S.E. and/or a Dir. Cut (w/ commentary) was never done (for whatever reasons) while Brando was still alive!  Perhaps, and/or hopefully, Criterion will put a good package together someday!?
0553212540|5.0|In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines.  Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.<br /><br />He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.<br /><br />In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!<br /><br />I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy.  You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can.

While most authors usually mess up a book's ending this ending left me satisfied and happy. It ends with a quote from the religion made for this book. As soon as i opened the first page and read the line : \\"Nothing in this book is true\\" i knew it was going to be amazing. However, not all people would enjoy this book. If you like plain, simple, books that don't make you think or use imagination this is not the book for you.

B00000DQSS|5.0|Released in September of 1980, Kate Bush's 3rd album \\"Never for Ever\\" is, as the saying goes, \\"through the roof\\"--this is a phenomenal piece of work.  It's very all over the map, yet it flows stunningly well as an album--in other words, \\"Never for Ever\\" takes you on an exhilirating journey.  Kate is absolutely one of the most amazing vocalists ever--incredibly expressive, versatile, making great use of her extraordinary range, and a master of nuance.  And of course, there's also Kate's astonishing songwriting abilities and her magical piano playing.  The creepy album-opener \\"Babooshka\\" is, for lack of better term, a twisted pop-rocker, and it's incredibly tuneful with great tension and an explosive chorus; its tells a tale of a woman secretly playing tricks on her husband, making it rather reminiscent of \\"The Pina Colada Song\\" by Rupert Holmes in a lyrical sense, though it's a totally different ball of wax from a musical perspective.  The drum machine-based \\"Delius (Song of Summer)\\" is gorgeous with its melodically rich piano and masterfully textured sound--with the music and Kate's soaring vocals, it evokes the feeling of a wonderful starry night.  \\"Blow Away (For Bill)\\" is a remarkably intriguing tribute to pop/ rock stars who died young--the chorus features bizarre pronunciation (done this way intentionally, no doubt) and makes reference to Minnie Riperton, Keith Moon, Sid Vicious, Buddy Holly, and Sandy Denny, with Marc Bolan also referenced in the last verse; the song achieves an incredibly bittersweet quality, thanks to the wonderful sighing chord changes, soaring melodicism, and the heart-tuggingly emotional lyrics.  She moves into Celtic-flavored territory on the enchanting \\"All We Ever Look For\\"--it's about relationships between children and their parents, and the lyrics ring very true indeed.  \\"The Wedding List\\" features incredibly twisted lyrics sung from the point of view of a possessed, jealous woman--quite disturbing subject matter, but the drama and Kate's devilish vocals are captivating.  Kate serves up a really fun rocker with the cartoonishly erotic \\"Violin\\" which fittingly features quasi-atonal violin work--she gets a little carried away with her orgasmic yelps, but the hilariously obsessive, manic chorus is a blast.  The musically gentle, mandolin-laden \\"Army Dreamers\\" is another sumptuously melodic song and has extremely poignant lyrics.  She ends the album with the chilling \\"Breathing\\"--sung from the point of view of an unborn child, it takes a brilliant look at problems of nuclear power which had become of great concern in the late '70s, and it also makes reference to mothers who smoke during pregnancy (one of the saddest things a woman can do); the song does suffer a bit from the melodramatic chant at the end, but it's a pretty minor complaint on an album that really blows you away.  I really want to point out that the production values on this album are really amazing--pristinely recorded, sublime sound quality, cool use of sound effects, truly a timeless piece of work; ironically, no producer's credit is listed, though it's an easy guess that Kate was definitely calling the shots.  You definitely have to give credit though to the numerous ace musicians she has on here helping her out.  The fact that this album still sounds like such a startlingly original breakthrough after nearly 25 years after its original release is a testament to Kate's one-of-a-kind nature.  \\"Never for Ever\\" is a definite must-have recording.
1400031354|4.0|I heard the title of this book mentioned several times, so I got it from my library and read it. It took me a while to catch on to the different kind of writing (the author is Scottish from South Africa?) I liked it very much after I got into it. I really like Mme Precious Ramotswe. I do wish the author would come up with nicknames for people like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Good story. I'll probably read more.
B00006IUL7|4.0|A simple situation in cop country, L.A. California. An oldtimer did something irregular to prove the guilt of a criminal who otherwise would have gone through unscathed. His younger partner is put under pressure by some investigation in the service and he is going to yield, i.e. speak. In a difficult investigation in Alaska the senior cop is confronted with the possible accident of shooting at some outline that could be the criminal or any other cop on the ground, because of the poor visibility due to fog. He shoots, and it is his partner. The criminal witnessed this event and, as a detective story writer, manipulates the cop into some impossible situation that is aiming at making someone else be found and proved guilty. Unluckily things are moving slightly differently. And the result will be a whole slate of dead bodies. There definitely is some suspense in all that. We are constantly wondering what the criminal or the cop are going to do to trap each other and we are in for quite a few surprises. Good entertainment even if it is not a masterpiece. No psychological depth, no social dimension, no symbolical power, just a cat and a mouse playing together and we of course never know who the cat is, not to speak of the mouse. A perfect situation for a third little animal to come into the picture and play his own game.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Mind numbingly bad Keanu Reeves film that makes you want to tear your hair out with Keanu giving his career worse performance and most of the actors giving theirs as well. The story is a clear rip off of horror movies from the past and it makes even the viewer feel stupid after it's all over. Only Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare are able to transcend their badly written characters and that's because they are too good of actors to be even in this mess. <br /> <br />Hopefully Weisz, Housou and Stormare will learn to read their scripts better after this debacle.  <br />
0307120007|5.0|While I agree the perfume smelling flowers are not the best smelling ever... who cares? This book is great for being interactive with young babies. I bought it for my 7 month old niece. She loves it! She caught on right away to patting the bunny, peekaboo with Paul and Daddy's scratchy face. In particular, I was impressed that the peekaboo cloth stays tight and she grabs onto it and pulls hard to get the peekaboo going.  <br /> <br />Is it a slightly older book? yes. But I have not seen other books that are better for the stimulating the senses of a baby. She has books that I ask her where is the cat? where is the bunny? and she doesn't quite get thqat yet, but the touching and playing she does.

B0009IOR6Q|4.0|So the glorious day arrived yesterday.  Cry-Baby the Director's Cut on DVD!  Woo!  And the movie is as nifty and cool as I remember.  Johnny Depp and the amazing supporting cast continue to delight in their performances, and the silliness with the great songs is as fun as ever. <br /> <br />BUT...man, I'm not usually one of those people who get hung up on picture/sound quality, but there were some egregious sound problems that made me wince.  Several of the songs were \\"miked\\" strangely causing problems created with the mix of the back-up vocals.  \\"Doin' Time for Being Young\\" especially loses its punch with the strangely loud back-up singers overpowering the instruments and the lead vocals.  In fact, it sounds like ONE guy is just not blending in with the rest but for some reason was given the mike.  This is a problem I've never encountered on the VHS copy, the soundtrack, or the cable version.  Similar sound problems plague \\"Please, Mr. Jailer\\" causing some of the back-ups to be lost this time, and the lead so overly amped that the lip-synching is completely obvious, whereas previous versions upheld the illusion very well that both Amy Locane and Johnny Depp were actually singing. <br /> <br />It's probably a minor thing to most people, but it was sad to have an otherwise enjoyable trip down Memory Lane marred by some questionable choices in sound transfer and remixing.  The movie itself -- five stars all the way.  The production -- 2.5-3 stars depending on how disappointed I'm feeling.
B00004T9UF|5.0|\\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" is undoubtably Eminem's best effort. While \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" and \\"The Eminem Show\\" are great albums, they cannot match up to the dark humor and catchy songs of \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\" I sincerely believe that there is not one bad song on the album. \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" is not, however, for the faint of heart, as every song contains multiple F-bombs, drug references, gun violence, etc. For those that can handle that, it only adds to the greatness of the album, because it offers a startling glimpse inside the artist's head that you don't get with all the other tired \\"gangsta rap\\" crap that is out there. <br /> <br />Song reviews: <br />1. Public Service Announcement 2000 - It's a skit. <br />2. Kill You - Funny, but the raps in the middle are not quite as catchy as many of the other songs on the album. The hook is great. If you don't agree with me, I \\"will f!%#ing kill you!\\" (Rating: 8.5/10) <br />3. Stan - It can drag on slightly, but the story is great. I think its one of the most creative and well written songs that Em has ever done. (Rating: 9/10) <br />4. Paul (Skit) - Another skit. <br />5. Who Knew - The lyrics are very creative, and the first verse is especially cathcy. (Rating: 9.5/10) <br />6. Steve Berman (Skit) - Another skit, showcasing the fact that Steve Berman is a dumb@$$ who does not want to make money. <br />7. The Way I Am - It can get a little tiring, but the rant against everybody is a solid song. Not as good as some of the others though. (Rating 8/10) <br />8. The Real Slim Shady - This is one of the weaker songs on the album. The lyrics are not as offensive as the rest of the album, which makes me not like it as much. Lol (it's true though). (Rating: 6/10) <br />9. Remember Me? - The first two verses are crap, but Em's verse is very good. Hmm... maybe I should try not saying \\"f!#%ing\\" for six minutes... NAH! (Rating: 6/10) <br />10. I'm Back - Great SONG!! I love it. It's catchy and the lyrics are great. I especially love the Columbine part, although part of it is censored!! [The censored part is: \\"I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line\\") Well, I will take seven kids from Columbine and bash their freakin' heads out! Censor that, Interscope! (Rating: 10/10) <br />11. Marshall Mathers - Apparently Em doesn't like homosexuals. Kind of a sucky song.. but he does like to kill gays. (Rating: 4/10) <br />12. Ken Kaniff (Skit) - This is the most F'ed up song (skit actually) that I've ever heard. Unless you like gay porn... you should skip it. (Rating: -895/10) <br />13. Drug Ballad - Another mediocre song, I don't like the dance song beat. (Rating: 5/10) <br />14. Amityville - I like the angry murder fantasies, but the song's sound can be abrasive at times. (Rating: 7/10) <br />15. B!#@h Please II - Great beat. Great raps, although the end of Em's falls a bit flat. Overall, a very good song with a very cathcy hook. (Rating: 9.5/10) <br />16. Kim - The hook is good, but the so-called verses suck. Yeah, I'd like to violently murder some people too, but I'd make a better rap about it. The violence is cool though. P.S.: Interscope needs the stop censoring stuff.. so what if a six-year-old got his throat cut. (Rating: 4/10) <br />17. Under the Influence: A very good song, everyone's raps are good. (Rating: 10/10) <br />18. Criminal: The last verse of this song is the best part of any Eminem song ever. I dare you to listen to this song without rewinding that part like six times. (Rating: 10/10) <br /> <br />GREAT ALBUM!

1565847032|3.0|Before reading Understanding Power, I knew of Noam Chomsky only by his (formidable) reputation as a linguist and author of Manufacturing Consent, which I had not, at the time, read. In truth, I was prompted to buy Understanding Power - said to be a good collection of his works, having read, and been perplexed by, Chomsky's effusive praise of a less-than-convincing book about the nastiness of corporations (\\"The Corporation\\", by Joel Bakan.) I was curious as to how such a respected, academic, intelligent commentator could come to be praising such a bone-headed book.<br /><br />Well, I am curious no more.<br /><br />This is a nicely edited, packaged edition, which benefits from the fact that it seems to contain mostly transcripts of Socratic-style \\"teach-ins\\" (love-ins, more like) that Chomsky has conducted over the last few years. It's conversational and very easy to read: far from being weighed down by the carefully premeditated prose of a stuffy academic, Understanding Power positively zings with invective, humour, and oratory. Parts of it are funny (not always intentionally so), parts fascinating, Chomsky's command of the \\"received\\" facts of recent political history (and his self-declared \\"true\\" ones) is consistently impressive.<br /><br />Not only does this book give you a very clear exposition of Chomsky's perspective, it is very entertaining as it does it. Credit, therefore, to the editors who have presumably sifted through weeks of audio tape, and have cleaned up and contextualised to add to the reading pleasure. They've also compiled footnotes of greater length than the text, which are available for spods online.<br /><br />While his facts maybe impeccably marshalled, many of the conclusions at which Chomsky arrives - particular in the field of economics - are obviously baloney (it is basically conspiracy and paranoia writ on a scale even James Ellroy would baulk at) but it's maddeningly difficult to nail down exactly why. But this evening, in a taxi on the way home from my wage-slavery (ahem), on page 216, I nailed it: Chomsky's richest polemic is almost all unfalsifiable. There are no conceivable facts you could present to Chomsky that would lead him to say, \\"You know what? You're right! I've got this all completely wrong!\\" Arguing against Noam Chomsky would be like arguing against a born-again Christian. Facts are construed to fit the theory, and not the other way around.<br /><br />That quality - falsifiability - is what distinguishes valid argument from dogma. The fact that something is capable of being proven false is what gives it explanatory traction in the world. If a statement is true for all possible circumstances, it's either circular, tautological or it bears no relation to the world we live in.<br /><br />So when the stooges in his audience meekly suggest that his proposal for how to really manage an economy (namely: everyone pulls together and works towards the common good, no-one fights, no-one wants more than their fair share, everyone co-operates - utterly brilliant, isn't it?) has been tried in a few places, and it fell apart pretty quickly, Chomsky's retort is 'but that wasn't REALLY socialism! That was actually disguised CAPITALISM!' hence - objection is defined away, as opposed to being defended.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are still some glaring facts which Chomsky can't explain away: The most obvious is that if the media and corporate elites are so indoctrinated, so suppressive of \\"dissident\\" views like Chomsky's, then how can Chomsky himself have been such a roaring success? A search within Amazon on \\"Noam Chomsky\\" lists 536 books (ten times as many as for \\"Rush Limbaugh\\", five times as many as for \\"P J O'Rourke\\", and only 8 fewer than for \\"George Bush\\"!). Chomsky is a global superstar, an arch propagandist, a fantastic brand, and though he commends his disciples not to take his word for it, legions of them (most notably the slurpers who sit cross-legged at his feet in the pages of this book) simply do. No-one subjects his patter to sustained criticism - possibly because it is no more fun than arguing with a born-again Christian. I suspect what sticks in Chomsky's craw more than anything else isn't that he's suppressed by his political opponents - he simply isn't - it's that he's happily tolerated and, for the most part, ignored.<br /><br />And it's not really hard to see why. On one hand, Chomsky has little enough faith in the intellectual integrity of his common man to blame the prevalence of consumerism and capitalism on his brainwashing by the media and the corporate elite, but enough faith in it to suppose that some sort of anarcho-syndicalist communal form of existence for humankind is even remotely viable. He may well be right in his first assessment (but if they're happy, so what, actually?); the second is ludicrous. But it's the only solution he can come up with - such is the poverty of his constructive analysis. It is one thing to criticise, quite another to propose a constructive alternative - and I'm afraid consensual, non coercive, state-free social planning (if by that you don't mean naked capitalism, and trust me, Chomsky doesn't) just ain't it.<br /><br />Lest you think I'm exaggerating about Chomsky's skills as a propagandist, check out this little piece of disinformation: The dust jacket of Understanding Power quotes the New York Times as describing Chomsky as \\"arguably the most important intellectual alive\\". Well, if you read the book, you'll know that Chomsky is no fan of the New York Times, so I was surprised by this quote - surprised enough to Google on it to see if I could find the original. And I did: properly contextualised, it reads \\"...Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive today. He is also a disturbingly divided intellectual. On the one hand there is a large body of revolutionary and highly technical linguistic scholarship, much of it too difficult for anyone but the professional linguist or philosopher; on the other, an equally substantial body of political writings, accessible to any literate person but often maddeningly simple-minded\\".<br /><br />Haha, Professor Chomsky: Caught red-handed! *Now* who is \\"manufacturing consent\\"?<br /><br />At the end of the day, the most withering criticism of Noam Chomsky's political outlook comes not from the New York Times, but from the much-beloved satire on the anarcho-syndicalist peasant in Monty Python and the Holy Grail quoted in the title of this review.<br /><br />I must say, I tend to side with King Arthur's ultimate view, as he trudges away, bored and frustrated with totally pointless conversation.<br /><br />Python Afficionados will know what I mean.<br /><br />Olly Buxton<br /><br />*******<br />Clarification: When reading the book I had assumed that Chomsky was some sort of cognitive relativist. I've since spent quite a lot of time reading around Chomsky, and it turns out that he's anything but: The linguistic \\"nativism\\" championed by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker is perhaps the last bastion of intellectual support for moral and cognitive objectivism, and this world view is apparent (ironically) in Chomsky's political writing. My fault: I guess I just couldn't credit that anyone still seriously advanced this perspective, especially from the Left.<br /><br />For when Chomsky says \\"seemingly unobjectionable state of affairs X is actually a malicious conspiracy Y\\", his criticism relies on the *falsehood* of explanation X and the *truth* of explanation Y. Cognitive relativism is no friend of Chomsky's at all: On the contrary, it undermines his position by saying that explanations X and Y are alternative descriptions of the same state of affairs, and *in the absence of data which are inconsistent with one or other explanation* ones subscription to one or the other is almost certainly a matter of historical contingency, and (*in the absence of contrary data*) there is no means of adjudicating between those explanations.<br /><br />Chomsky's explanations tend to rely on \\"hidden hands\\" (conspiracies between capitalists, government agencies and so forth) which are characterised by nothing so much as their lack of evidence - indeed, this very lack of evidence of conspiracy is often the \\"clincher\\" by which Chomsky claims the conspiracy must exist.<br /><br />Olly Buxtoncessible to any literate person but often maddeningly simple-minded\\".

B00004XONN|5.0|There are only 2 bands to ever write perfect music: Radiohead and the Beatles. Kid A was a blow to the system; it is completely different to Pablo Honey, the Bends or OK Computer, but it still blows my mind. <br /> <br />Everything In Its Right Place has got the best opening to any song ever written, National Anthem the best bass line on any radiohead album and Motion Picture Soundtrack is a quality and apt ending for the album. Hail to the Thief is my favorite album, but Kid A and Amnesiac provided the background (as did the Bends and OKC, but not as much) for Thief.  <br /> <br />Everyone from a moody teenager to a classical music connoisseur should buy, listen to and love this album.
B00000IL26|4.0|This is a fairly happy date - not a lot of \\"blue notes\\" for a classic Blue Note release. But that's cool. It's nice to hear Lee Morgan sound so playful, kinda like Brownie. And especially interesting to hear a young Joe Henderson in this context. IMHO, if the rhythm section played just a little less generically, this would be a 5 star session. This RVG edition has excellent sound.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This is without a doubt, one of the very best dramatic series I have ever seen.  Why on earth hasn't Masterpeice Theater replayed it?  Given what PBS has recently gone through with its governing board and accusations of \\"liberal bias\\", perhaps it's understandable that they don't want to be seen to be criticizing our political masters, but the point has already been made.  Why leave it up to mealy-mouthed special-effects fests like \\"Retread of the Sith\\", when works like this do so with so much more poise and precision?<br /><br />The House of Cards series combines superlative acting skills with pointed commentary on power, ambition and politics.  Three great scripts (I disagree with those who say Part 3 was weaker than the others, but more on this below), and superb directing and acting make this the highlight of my summer viewing for sure.  For US viewers, this series is as excellent as the Sopranos, and Homicide and for similar reasons (interesting characters, wonderful actors and compelling plot lines).<br /><br />*General spoiler alert*<br /><br />This series is many things to many people, but it is to my mind, first and foremost a Shakespearean drama.  Screenwriter Andrew Davies makes this quite clear in his discussions of the series.  To that end, the most important thing in the series is our villain and his arc from charming, ruthless monster to cornered animal.<br /><br />How sad that Ian Richardson hasn't been given the chance to display his incredible acting talents to a wider audience.  His portrayl of the caiman-like Conservative politician Francis Urquhart  captured the simultaneously mesmerizing and sheer evil quality of Urquhart beautifully (Richardson won a BAFTA in 1991 for House of Cards and was nominated again in 1993 for To Play the King, and again in 1996 for The Final Cut). Richardson's training in theater (he was with the Royal Shakespeare Company for 15 years) stand him in excellent stead here, but the most compelling pieces of acting he does are often expressed with no more than a glance at the camera, or a lifted eyebrow or corner of the mouth.  The man's a genius in my humble opinion.<br /><br />House of Cards has had an interesting effect on political behavior in the UK in particular. The non-denial denial \\"You might say that... I couldn't possibly comment\\" that was one of Urquhart's favorite catchphrases has become established usage among British public figures, including then-Prime Minister John Major.  It's also been acronymized for use in cyberspace as YMSTICPC.<br /><br />As a number of other people have pointed out, this series strongly evokes specific Shakespearean works, notably MacBeth, and Richard III.  There are however, echoes of other tragedies as well, particularly King Lear (Urquhart's soliloquy on being \\"a father of daughters\\" for one, and the use of the \\"sharper than a serpent's tooth\\" quotation) and Titus Andronicus (F.U.'s ease with violence, and the black humor throughout the series) particularly in Part 3 (The Final Cut).  I suppose if one wanted to play the \\"match the series with the play\\" game, Part 1 would be analogous to the first half of MacBeth, Part 2 to Richard  (up to the Battle of Bosworth), and Part 3 would be Lear with Act V of Richard thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Thus the supposed \\"weaknesses\\" in F.U.'s behavior in Part 3: his tendency to surround himself with weaklings, his descent into open violence, and his inability to \\"smell the mood\\" of his colleagues can in fact be better understood as classic Shakespearean indicators of the ruler who has finally lost his edge through age, hubris or paranoia (or some combination of all 3).<br /><br />Much has been made of Mrs. Urquhart's similarity to Lady MacBeth, but she's really more like the homicidal Goneril in \\"Lear\\": None of Lady M's weak-kneed descent into madness for her.  In fact, the Tragedy of Francis Urquhart (apart from the mayhem he inflicts -indirectly depicted by the director for the most part, on the well-being of ordinary British people) might well be most clearly expressed in the treacherousness or self-servingness of those who surround him at the end.<br /><br />Some people believe that this series does not translate well for American audiences, my sense is that this is far from the case. Certainly some of the more subtle satire and the British cultural references might be lost, (such as the reference to the children's hand-puppet character Sooty - think Lamb Chop or Elmo as a stuffed bear) and it certainly helps to have a passing familiarity with British Parliamentary procedure (in particular the wonderful institution of \\"Prime Minister's Question Time\\").<br /><br />Nevertheless these are minor details in the overall scheme of things.  British politics has no monopoly on stupidity, manipulation or naked ambition.  Viewers in other countries will have no trouble recognizing their own domestic versions of F.U.,  some perhaps in their own workplaces.  Can we recognize this same behavior (admittedly with much less wit and sophistication) in some people in the current US administration? You might think that, you might very well think that, ...

0451163516|4.0|The best part about this book is that halfway through the story, I couldn't figure out what ending to hope for.  Follett does an excellent job of creating sympathy for each character, even the evil ones, a characteristic found in some of his other novels as well.  All of them are in very precarious situations and each possible outcome spells disaster for some other character in the book.  On the one hand, I wanted the assassin to carry out the murder for his own sake and for the prevention of WWI(even though it did happen), but I also wanted the Russian prince to survive because he is a good character and it would be disastrous for the entire Walden family.  Rarely does an author present such a conflict, most resort to the hope of a happy ending which the reader knows is inevitable but this one is definitely unique.  There is no true happy ending.  <br /> <br />This is an all-around solid book.  You really do feel for the characters and their dilemmas.  The story never drags, each chapter has some kind of contribution to the overall quality and the high stakes involved ensure the reader's attention for the duration of the book.  Worth the $8.
B00000JZI9|5.0|This is one of my favorite Westerns.  Besides Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid most westerns before the mid-eighties had a tendency to be stoic and way too serious for my taste. (With the exception of  \\"The Cheyenne Social Club\\" with Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda, it's a MUST SEE!!!) The entire star filled cast paints a rousing cinematic picture that is different from the earlier westerns.  The little corrupt town of Silverado is shaken to it's weak foundation when people who are minding their own business are shoved too often and too hard.  Our heroes rain down on Silverado like the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  <br /> <br />   Silverado has a light, exciting touch to it, mostly because of the 2 Kevins.   Kevin Costner is not one of my favorite actors but his character is so hyper, unpredictable and barely under control in this movie you'd swear he was about to wet his pants.  He was such a riot!  Since he began acting this is in my opinion his most animated performance ever  (Except when he played the corpse of the guy who killed himself in \\"The Big Chill\\" ) He and his antics light up the screen whenever he shows up.  So he DOES have more than one dimension when it comes to acting....he just picks one-dimensional characters.   Kevin Kline is always a treat to watch.  The twinkle in his eye no matter what role he plays leaves a light touch in your heart.  His character is endearing, witty and then serious when he needs to me.    <br /> <br />The cast is huge with the Lawrence Kasden standbys of Danny Glover, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner and Jeff Goldblum.  There is also Scott Glenn, Brian Dennehy, John Cleese, Lynn Whitfield, Rosanna Arquette, Linda Hunt and Joe Seneca. With every scenario in a western you can think of paid tribute to, this movie single-handedly jumpstarted the return of the Western to the big screen and small screen for that matter.  The formula was fresh and new and not stale at all like most of the predictable westerns before it.  So pop some popcorn, get a huge soda crank up the surround sound and see it.   <br />
B00008DDRX|5.0|If you don't have the seven digit coin laying around to own a Porsche 917, this is definitely the next best thing.  This movie has amazing cinematography of some of the most classic race cars in the world.  The movie is really for racing buffs, and sports car buffs in particular.  Yes, there is a contrived love story thrown in to keep the Hollywood brass happy, but this one is all about the cars, and that's what makes it great.  I love just throwing in the DVD, skipping to the start of the race and watch the first lap sequence on a large widescreen set with the sound up loud.  Set in 1971, it is a way to enjoy the last breed of cars before the days of turbos, fuel consumption rules, and ground effects.  You really get to see and hear the power of the 5 liter air cooled flat 12 Porsche engine.  Two years later a 5.4 liter twin turbo version was made producing 1100 bhp.  The coolest racing story for me was talking to Michael and Mario Andretti and a Porsche engineer at 3 AM in the paddock of the 1984 Daytona 24 Hours.  The Porsche 962 they were driving (the first one to race in the US derived from the European rules 956) had just retired due to a blown turbo and the engineer showed me the engine and what broke and the Andrettis gave me their impressions of a car that went on to dominate sports car racing for a decade.
B00005JKG5|5.0|I remember when this came out and I saw it. One of the many great films of the early to mid eighties, esp in this genre. As one reviewer said, it made Jennifer Beals an overnight sensation, but sadly, she did not get the best movie roles after that. Yes, It is disappointing that big-screen success eluded her after this film, but you can't take Flashdance from her. But GOD, she was GEORGEOUS in this film, and like another reviewer said, she still looks good today.  Dynamite soundtrack as well. I'm definitely going to get a copy for sure.
B00006M183|4.0|I loved ten when it came out, and was a bit sceptical about Vs. when it came out, but loved it as well later. Hated Vitalogy when it came out, never really got to appreciate it. No Code, Yield, Binaural gave up on all of those on first listens. Then I hear the song called love boat captain and decide to check out Riot Act. Now THIS is a lot better than I've heard from PJ in the last few years.  <br />Starts off really catchy with \\"Can't keep\\", \\"Save you\\" is a nice rocker, and then comes the great \\"Love boat captain\\". the next songs are all okay, but then the album collapses with the terrible \\"you are\\" - a stupid industrial sounding song. \\"Get right\\" is terrible too. so are the next songs. Luckily. the end of the album is saved by the excellent 1/2 full and great closer All or None (i purposely skipped the filler track \\"arc\\"). <br />This album isnt exactly worth 4 stars, but a bit more than 3, so i wish i could give it 3,5 stars...
0805211063|5.0|This unfinished chef-d'oeuvre begins with the hero (a man named \\"K.\\") entering an unknown village where a castle looms overhead from a far off hilltop.  Later the reader is told that K. was summoned by The Castle to be employed as a land-surveyor, though there is always the nagging suspicion that this is not true, as he is never admitted entrance to The Castle.  From this point on, the book concerns itself with K.'s obsession with reaching The Castle.  Why, and for what benefit, the reader does not know.  Still, whether or not we feel sympathy for the hero or interest for his goal, is of little importance compared to the interest we take in the events that seem to just lurk around the corner at any moment.  The reader constantly has the impression that everything is just about to explode.  `The Caste' is one of the few books I have read more than once, which I have enjoyed every time.  Having just finished the book for the third time, I felt as though it were the first, and it was sad to come to the end (though remember, there is no real end as the work was never finished).  Kafka's genius lies in setting a mood to a place and creating a timeless and eerie setting.  Like the strange version of Paris in the great masterpiece by Roman Payne, 'Crepuscule'; or the fortress in Nabokov's brilliant book, 'Invitation to a Beheading', the unknown village in 'The Castle' is a bizarre world that seems to live independently of the rest of the world and independently of all time.  Even Kafka's mention of telephones and other modern objects seems not to detract from the timeless world he has invented.  For writers and those who study literature, `The Caste' is an illuminating guide to great literary style.  For readers and lovers of literature, `The Caste' is the perfect book to get lost in.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album is already classic. I still love it, and listen to it a lot. Everything about this album is just great. The songs, the order of the tracklisting is perfect. The Radio parts tie them together, it works so well. Josh Homme and Nick Oliviery play top notch. Dave Grohl OWNS the drums. Mark Lanegan's vocals rule. \\"No one KNOWS\\" is the classic song here, so is \\"First it Giveth\\".  <br />Too bad that 3 of the 4 members left QOTSA (altough Oliviery was the only official member to leave), the follow up is very weak.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Just a quick couple thoughts.  I originally heard this CD from a copy that I got from a friend.  I've listened to it almost every day to and from work for about a week...I'm definitely hooked.<br /><br />It's just a good combination of hard drives with enough space in between to catch your breath (and rest your vocal chords if you've been singing along).<br /><br />The final word I have to say may be obvious but I just feel it needs mentioning.  Someone who bothers to write a review like \\"I've always hated this kind of music and especially this band\\", and gives it one star is probably not a review you want to base your purchase choice off of.<br /><br />Find someone who has the CD, listen to it.  If you like it, buy it like I just did.

0393324818|5.0|I have read all the current business books, but Moneyball was definitely among the best.      For one thing, I thought that the book was going to be about baseball.  It is more like an MBA project study ... \\" Your assignment is to build a major league baseball team with a payroll of $40M that will compete with, and defeat, the New York Yankees with a payroll more than three times higher.\\"      Only, it is a real case.    And the results are in the paper every morning.    For another, I thought that it was a book about Billy Beane. Frankly, it is more of a book about the repudiation of all the past, present and future Billy Beanes - the talented \\"5 tool\\" teenagers, most failures - as they become a lesser part of the overall strategy to building a successful, and sustainable, business model.    And finally, Moneyball is a book from which you can learn - and use in your daily business, even if it is not baseball.    For those of us who must put together strategies, this book is a must-read primer.  Beane relies on different sets of data to make decisions,  identifies new metrics on which to evaluate talent, eliminates \\"old school\\" thinking from cigar chomping talent scouts who previously had made the recommendations that resulted in more misses than hits over the years, and develops a methodology for determining the relative value of players before cashing them in for developmental (e.g., lower cost) opportunities.    Not only does his strategy work (as evidenced by copy cat GMs in recent years), his Oakland team makes money - and lots of it.  And, he did it by allowing two MVPs and other \\"name\\" players to move to other teams because their cost-to-value no longer fit within the Oakland value proposition.    What this book has given me is the curiosity to seek different data to investigate and evaluate facts in order to find new answers to old questions.  Actually, when it is read with Freakonomics as part of a day-night double-header, Moneyball will get your brain working with every turn of the page.

0060763280|5.0|This book will appeal to those who got something out of \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\". It is designed to help people identify thinking patterns that do not serve them. Eker provides a simple, witty way of helping us take a look at what we've been socialized to think when handling money. Someone's got to help the  middle class and poor see what our parents were not able to teach us. America is still a young country, and many of us come from immigrants and slaves, so the mentality that is passed on from generation to generation may be primarily what we're taught in public school: get good grades, get a good job and work hard. We all know that one does not get rich doing the \\"right thing\\". The extra stuff that we don't learn in school, or the courses most of us avoid taking since we want to pass our classes and get out of school, is about numbers, fractions, percentages, compounded interest and so on. These concepts are foreign to us and frankly, the average person is socialized to avoid the unknown.  I personally found the book to be extremely helpful in redirecting my thoughts about myself, and my spending and keeping money.  There is a secret to being rich in this country. It's about attitude.
B0002U0UKS|5.0|I'm not sure why the Amazon listing omits the clearly labeled English translations, but this is a gorgeous soundtrack with a lot more depth than anything with the exception of Spirited Away. Look for a lot of more subtle moments, particulary the stunningly beautiful \\"The Boy Who Accepted The Star\\" with its stately, almost sad flow of a single horn and strings swelling to soft moments of sheer beauty.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
0913866156|5.0|This deck is the deck to end all decks. It was my 3rd set of card when I first began studying long ago. 1st was Rider-Waite, 2nd IJJ Swiss. This set the standard even in todays mass market of Tarot production. <br /> <br />I already had a strong foundation in astrology,(the Thoth deck specializes in this) and Egyptian Myth. This was all too easy to understand the occult depth. Then the ultimate assistant in reading is the minors have the meanings written out for you. How convenient for beginners and those bad with memorization!LOL! <br /> <br />The majors all hold deep meaning with many of life's lessons! The Chariot is colored so vibrantly and the Death card means business! The Universe is my personal favorite. <br /> <br />There has been much written about this deck. Most of which goes over my head.I am not a Thelemite or Golden Dawn practitioner. The philosophy goes over my head. Crowleys work in general is far out there! <br /> <br />It is my humble opinion that he left behind something that will last for years, maybe centuries to come. That is his wonderful Tarot deck. I simply refer to it as the Thoth. It shines, frightens and guides many around the world on a daily basis. What more could a reader ask for?

So this review is from a second generation fan. <br />   Like John's openning chord to \\"A Hard Days Night\\", McCartney hooks you in with his great bass line from one of John's coolest songs \\"Come Together\\" and we are off and running.  <br />     Paul would boast to how tight a band the Beatles were and  this album is his proof, playing with incredible crispness, and enthusiasum, despite thier personnal differences. <br />  Side one is mix of Rock, love and even silly, ending brilliantly by John's editting finesse. Side two is legend, starting off with Harrisons \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", a songwritters dream. But it is \\"the medley\\" that anchors Abbey Road to your artistis soul. I tell people, when \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" starts strumming, sit down, do nothing, and listen. When \\"Her Majesty\\" perks you out of the quiet at the end. It is because you are sitting in awe of what is the Beatles Genius. This album is flawless. Buy It!
B000002LOE|4.0|This album isn't too bad.  It has one of the most famous and most played REM downbeat singles \\"Losing My Religion\\" which is a good song.  \\"Low\\" the other kind of downbeat song goes well with the single.  It has cool congas, organ, and dreary vocals from Stipe.  These are two good downbeat gems from REM...ONe of the best parts of this album. <br /> <br />\\"Near Wild Heaven\\" and \\"Shiny Happy People\\" are my two other favorite songs.  \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" features some great contributions on extra high vocals from Mike and Bill backing up Stipe which really give the song great pop edge.  It almost seems like a 50's pop song or just maybe a Big Star song...both I guess.  Shiny Happy People has strings and just is ultra catchy.  With female backing vocals to add to Stipes and Buck still does the jangly thing on this track...it's great. <br /> <br />Other Highlights=Radio Song, Me in Honey, Half a World Away.
B000050HTO|4.0|If this were, as it claims to be, the Essential Bob Dylan, it would have Tombstone Blues, From a Buick 6, Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues, Highway Sixty-One Revisited, Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again, Visions of Johanna, Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat, I Want You, Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You, Watching the River Flow, It's a Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall, My Back Pages, Tomorrow is a Long Time, When I Paint My Masterpiece, Down in the Flood, You're a Big Girl Now, Idiot Wind and Buckets of Rain. Thankfully, we still get old standards like Blowin' in the Wind, the Times They are a-Changin', Like a Rolling Stone and Positively 4th Street, as well as latter-day gems like Hurricane and Tangled Up in Blue. However, the Essential Bob Dylan is sort of unnessacary. For one, you could just buy Highway Sixty-One, Blonde on Blonde and Blood on the Tracks. For another, you could also get Greatest Hits Volumes I, II and III. Perfect for those on a budget, but if you've got enough cash to spend, buy the originals or the Greatest Hits albums.
B000002J1B|5.0|Relayer is one my favourite Yes progressive albums of the 70's.  Rick Wakeman doesn't play here, but he was replaced by a great Keyboardist:  Patrick Moraz. He does good solos too. Here are the songs and comments:    The gates of dellirium:   It was the longest track that Yes ever recorded  (side long in a vinyl, 22 minutes). Instead of being scared with the lenghth,  maybe you'll think this song shouldn't end. It's simply marvellous.  Chris Squire's bass is one of the highlights, it gives a special touch.    The part before John Anderson sings \\"Stand and fight, we do consider...\\" contains one of  the best instrumentations I've ever heard in a progressive album.The lyrics   are an epic that talk about people doing a revolution against opression and corruptive leaders.  The sung pieces have no comment: all catchy.  After a great Moraz solo , the band does the battle noises. Alan White's  percussion imitate swords colliding.  And then, after some more Keyboards and guitar, John sings \\"Soon, oh soon  the light...Our song will lead us , our reason to be here\\" followed by a calm and pretty melody.    Sound Chaser: This song has a weird intro. Steve Howe's solo in the middle is boring,but it has a good use of his abilities.  However, Patrick's sweet keyboards(before the lines cha-cha-cha-cha-cha) breaks the rigmarole.  This is the worst track.    To be over: This song is perfect from start to end.The voices fit very well with the melody.  Steve Howe uses something original: a slide guitar that sounds like hula hula in Hawaii.  Patrick's work before the lines \\"After all,your soul still surrenders\\" will make your mind travel.  This is one my favourite Yes songs.Extremely beautiful and memorable.      Besides the weaker Sound Chaser, the others provide all of these stars.  Remember:Play it with the basses increased in your sound equipment to feel the music effects completely.  The sleeve is a portrait of Gates of dellirium, with some dream castles.  The back sleeve of the vinyl(which I own) has two snakes on stones. I don't know if they appear in the cd's booklet.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Well, i started my COB collection with Follow the reaper, I loved it and knew that I had to get the rest of their cds. Next i got Hate crew deathroll, then something wild and after that the Thrashed EP. I loved every cd and for some reason i didnt think that Hatebreeder would be as good as the others. Well i ordered it and I was shocked, Not only is this album an amazing album from start to finish but In my opinion it is COB's best. The HIgh points are definatly Warheart, Silent night, bodom night, Children of bodom, and the best IMO Downfall. If your a metalhead and some harsh vocals dont bug you you must get this. Also even if you dont really care for harsh vocals you might still like COB. They were the band that got me past harsh vocals and have converted many others. This album is filled with super intense vocals and amazing guitar and keyboard shred, there is nothing not to like about it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the best album ever created by mankind.  After listening to it, I wouldn't be surprised that the Billie, Mike, and Tre are super-natural, because only gods could create something so purely perfect.  It is the definition of perfection, and for over an entire month I could not put anything else into my cd player and I listened to it constantly.  Green Day has come out with some awesome stuff before, but American Idiot just beats anything anybody has ever done before.  Nothing else can compare to its excellence.  They've truley outdone themselves here, proven that they're more than 3 immature punk kids singing about masturbation, sex, and drugs.  American Idiot is a punk opera, an entire story about a guy named Jesus who meets people like St. Jimmy and Whatsername along the way, people who change his life in very significant ways.  American Idiot is more than just a cd, if you listen to it you're listening to a story.  And if you listen closely, you will find many different political, societal, and psychological themes.  In that way it's just like reading a book or watching a movie, but it's music, which makes it one of the most original cd's ever created.  In an age of very crappy pop singers who don't even sing, it's great to see a band who sings, writes, plays, and even produces their own stuff.  The drumming and the guitars are too great to put into words, and the the singing is also phenomenal.  Every single aspect has been perfected; Green Day has covered every single detail.  They truley deserve to be paid millions of dollars, because American Idiot has changed not only my life, but so many other people's.  There'es so much variety on this cd.  You hear pure punk songs like American Idiot, St. Jimmy, and Holiday with very catchy melodies.  You hear very personal, slower paced songs like When September Ends where Billie describes the death of his father.  You hear 5 part, 9-minute songs like Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming where every one of those 5 parts os distincely different form each other.  In Extraordinary Girl you hear Indian flutes and drumming, and in other songs u hear styles that are reminiscent of classic rock.  Despite such differences in the songs, they're all magnificently bonded together with wonderful transitions.  Each song is its own chapter in this novel, but all of them blend together very nicely.    Anybody who says that this cd is anything short of amazing is just too stupid, too ignorant, or too lazy to actually listen closely to the music and interpret the underlying meanings of every single line.  If you carefully go through the entire cd, you will be dumbfounded.  If you think this cd is just a bunch of catchy radio tunes, or that it's just a bunch of stuff bashing Bush, well you're SEVERELY WRONG.  If you actually listen to it you will see the very many different aspects of it all.  Green Day has proven themselves musical geniuses for putting out this album.  The only way you cannot like this cd is if you either haven't listened to it, or if you misunderstood it due to your own ignorance to interpret it. (...) American Idiot is by far the biggest and best accomplishment of any rockers out there, so thank you Green Day for your hard work and dedication that created this masterpiece!
0060934719|5.0|I need to just take for granted that almost everything Neil Gaiman writes I will love.  I have stayed away from two of his books, Coraline and Stardust, for awhile because they have been often described as a young adult or children stories.  Having read both Neverwhere and American Gods and loving them, it took me awhile to finally swallow \\"my pride\\" and read books I thought were meant for little children not for everyone.  A silly and arrogant move, I know now.<br /><br />I read Stardust in one sitting.  It almost reads itself.  The pages fly by so quickly and easily that before you know it you're half way through the novel and that doesn't stop you from reading the other half.  It is a fairytale in one aspect, but something else entirely also.  It begins in the town of Wall where a wall has been placed keeping people of the UK from the otherside.  One day every nine years, the guards leave their posts and the people can mingle with those from the otherside, the Faerie side.  That's all I will really say about the plot.  Like every other Gaiman novel I have read, the story is best when you know little or nothing about it.<br /><br />Like most faerie tales, the story begins with love.  But, unlike stories like the Little Mermaid or Cinderella or countless other Grim stories, it goes a little further.  What begins as a \\"simple\\" quest to win someone's affection grows into a coming of age story where the protagonist learns more about himself and about life.  It's a grand story filled with vivid images and great characters.  Every character, from those who are given a paragraph to those who are the main protagonists or antagonists are filled with character.  Much like every other Gaiman novel, it's easy to fall in love with the characters as real breathing things.<br /><br />I'm not sure what else to say.  I wanted to write this review mainly to persuade those on the fence to read it and give it a chance.  It's filled with dark images, images of love both true and fake, and a great story.  If you enjoy Gaiman's other works, don't pass this one over.  Leave your preconceived notions at the door and I think you'll find it's a terrific read just as engaging as Neverwhere or American Gods..  If you enjoy Gaiman's other works, don't pass this one over.  Leave your preconceived notions at the door and I think you'll find it's a terrific read just as engaging as Neverwhere or American Gods.
B00005221M|5.0|Set in 1757 during the French and Indian War, \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is based (but does not strictly adhere to) the novel by James Fenimore Cooper. It is a lavish, exquisite production, with Daniel Day-Lewis fantastic as Hawkeye, showing a screen magnetism that is more intense than in any other part he has played. His chemistry with beautiful Cora, wonderfully portrayed by Madeleine Stowe is palpable, and they manage to have one of the most erotic love scenes ever filmed, without shedding a single garment. The film has many battles scenes, and could be categorized as \\"action/adventure,\\" but I always think of it as being primarily a romance, and it is also an excellent depiction of the early days of the settlers, and their many struggles.<br /><br />The setting is western New York, with much of the action taking place at Fort William Henry, but it was actually filmed in the lush and scenic wilderness of North Carolina, with superb cinematography by Dante Spinotti, and a lovely score by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman. Michael Mann's direction keeps a terrific pace, and the cast is wonderful, and includes Russell Means, marvelous in his film debut as Chingachgook, Eric Schweig as Uncas, Wes Studi as the revengeful Magua, Johdi May as Cora's sister Alice, and Steven Waddington impressive as Major Duncan Heyward.<br /><br />VHS vs. DVD: The Director's Expanded Edition, though still a brilliant film, is a disappointment, and I will be keeping my old letterbox VHS, which though worn, actually has a brighter picture than the DVD. The \\"expanded\\" portions add little to the enjoyment of the film, and the deletions hurt it. The incomplete conversation between Hawkeye and Cora in the burial ground is left hanging in the air, and the absence of Clannad's song, \\"I Will Find You\\", takes much of the magic from the scene where Hawkeye follows the captured Cora.<br />Total running time for the VHS, 114 minutes, DVD 117 minutes.
0380789035|4.0|This was the second Neil Gaiman novel I read.  Coming off of the high that was the magnificient Neverwhere, I hungrily started reading American Gods.<br /><br />The concept is definitely interesting, that the gods from history dating back to Odin are still alive and well.  Having fallen from public eye and mind, they are reduced to almost nothing.  Meanwhile, the new things we worship, TV internet etc have become more powerful gods and there is a war brewing.<br /><br />The novel, however, is slowly plodding as it builds a very large web of characters.  It's part road trip, part fantasy and at times partly boring.  Mostly it's because there is a very slow build up of tension as Gaiman introduces characters, ploys and plots.  It isn't until the midpoint where something huge happens that the novel truly takes off.  But even when it takes off, it does it at its own pace.  The payoff at the end, however, is spectacular and ties up the story really well.<br /><br />Fans of Gaiman will enjoy this novel.  I think, for me, the problem was coming off such a high given by Neverwhere that whatever I read next couldn't possibly live up to it.  It's still a really good novel.  It's not his best but it's an enjoyable read and has some great commentary about out culture and religion.
B00009W0WM|5.0|This is the best love story ever filmed. this is the story about love. story about honor, friendship. all of the precious manners in the world are toghether in this movie and in Rick's phenomenon! Ive watch this movie more than 50 times!

I didn't know that she had husband. our relationship was a complex of mystery and love. I was in love with her, she was in love with me. that was the best time in my life. leader of our relation was love, not sex! best time of my life! about 4 months. and then she dissapeared! she had her own reasons. after two years I met her again. this time with her husband. I met her alone and found out she was in love with me all the time. I didn't saw her again. It's about 5 years now and I'm still in love with her. I had many girlfriends after her, but no one could take her place in my heart. it was a strange story. when I watched Casablanca for first time, I Already watched the best story of my life. my feelings, my thoughts! If this movie had infulence on many people, it had double or even triple on me! and i recommand it to every kid, every teenager, to watch this movie. try to be like Rick! this movie has many lessons. this movie teechs you how to encounter with love of your life! how to tolorate failure and how to satisfy yourself!<br /><br />Satisfy! that's the most important part. after the failure everyone seek a way to be satisfy! some seek revenge, some can only cry. reactions can be various. but this movie teechs how to really satisfy. no one will regret of being a real man, even with an unfaithful whore!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|DT is one of the few bands that I go out and purchase their material without any advance knowledge of what is on the disc.  It has been that way since 1992 when I&W was given to me as a gift by a true friend. Since then I don't bother reading reviews of DT until after I make the purchase and only then it is to find out what other fans are thinking and saying.  Needless to say Train of Thought, with its darker sound and more intense edge is as good as any of the best metal albums out without the harsh \\"death-strangle-mumble\\" of much of the \\"heavy-metal\\" being broadcast and played on headbangers ball and similar.  I guess I am showing my age when I complain about the state of todays rock and metal music when I say that much of what comes out is either way to \\"lite\\" or else way to hard.  DT is the perfect blend of virtuosity and hard driven rock with a melodic core that I can listen to in the car with the wife and not have her tell me to turn it down.  Anyway, enough said, go buy it.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Honestly I've never liked George Lucas but in this case, I've been Totally Dissapointed! We grown ups have much memories of original Star Wars series. the Answer is, for whom they've released this DVD set? For kids and teenagers or original fans? Original Fans I guess cause Star Wars original movies are not that intresting for today kids and todays standards. If we bought this DVD set, first expectation of ours was too meet our memories again! <br />in first movie, they added more than 15 minutes of deleted scenes. 15 minutes of boring and even ridiculous additional Scenes that made Episode IV a boring movie. the original movie was approx 100 minutes and it was Dynamic and pure action! but in these new release, Action scenes have lost in that additional boring scenes. at least they could make them play at will, but there is no such an option. you condemn to watch them cause George want too! No need to say that they've manipulate old timer controllers and 70s costumes in the original movie with modern ones! and at last, they've remade some scenes with computer, Although that was not a bad Idea but they had no right to sell us a manipulated movie in the name of original! <br />Second movie was better. a least there is nothing that bothers you so much! <br />and the Third movie! OH MY GOD! They've sticked their rudness to heavens in this sequel! Instead of adapting newer sequels with old ones, they've manipulate the originals to adapt with newers! and what a brilliant manipulation! They've added some desperate Unsophisticated CGs based on The Cities Created in Episode I & 2 that show people celebrating for Rebels victory! CGs they've added are not even qulify to use in Copmputer games and they've added them to the end of such an Important movie. Episode IV Dissapointed me, on that base I tolorated Episode V, but this one was really a Repulsive Complex! They've changed the ghost of Anakin Skywalker with a Young guy to adapt with new sequel too! <br />I've sold my DVD set for a low price cause each time I saw it on the shelf, I got bad feeling. I still Stick to my 80s VHS tapes and Recommand for All of the owner, Don't miss them!  <br />Let's have some words about Bonus Disc too! I don't know if you have Indiana Jones trilogy or not? in that DVD set, each movie have it's own documentary and very useful documentaries. but the bonus disc in Star wars trilogy is not even worth to discuss! a nearly 2 hour unspecialize documentary. well, don't expect them to release original documentaries cause they want to fool people that these are original movies and we don't manipulate them. full releasing that old documentaries may reveal their trick!
B000007MVM|5.0|I got this cd because I had liked his stuff on the early singles, PATGOD, and ASOS. At first the music wasn't as great as I thought it would have been, but after a listen or two, I grew to love his album as much as pink floyd's. I love the songs Terrapin, No Man's Land, Octopus, and especially Late Night, which is amazing. Syd Barrett was an amazing guitar player and song writer and if you like his music, go to yahoo groups and look up madcapslaughing, which is a great site for stuff about Syd and a way to get rare songs from both Syd and Pink Floyd.
B0007M22TI|3.0|Agree with \\"Go Bears\\". Video quality is very good but I am having problems with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. I can clearly hear a very short distorted sound on the middle of the second song \\"Walking In The Air\\" (and other songs too). I do not have any problem when I switch audio option to regular stereo sound. <br /> <br />I don't have a home theater system. All I have is a Sony Wega TV and a cheap Apex DVD player. Maybe \\"Balanced Reviewer\\" is correct on the equipment part of his/her review. However, I don't have any problem with other music DVDs (such as Hayley Westenra's Live From New Zealand). <br /> <br />Still, my wife and I are very happy with this DVD. Who needs Dolby Digital 5.1 anyway? <br />
B00008BXJG|5.0|Bon Scott at his best.  When this album hit in '79 every High Rider Whiteboy at my high school owned a copy on vinyl or cassette and it could be heard eminating from boom-boxes all over school.  This album was AC/DC's best seller up to that point and it went a long way in securing a younger generation of fans for the band.  Scott had an very interesting edge to his voice which can not be found in any other singer in any era.  He was a screamer granted, but his stylized vocals paired with Angus Youngs licks and the heavy back beat of Malcom, Phil and Cliff make this band one of the all-time greats.  Buy this music and see for yourself!
1401902197|4.0|We have all heard about positive affirmations. This book is the only one - I was able to find - that will teach you how to do affirmations properly.  Illustrations on the book are beautiful.  And the book itself is so small one can carry it in the purse, or a pocket.  I was pleasantly suprised to find out that book had a CD in it.  So, if you just feel like listening to Ms. Hay's pleasant voice you can just do that and still find it calming and fulfilling.  You will look at your life differently.  Once I finished the book, I went ahead and bought Louise Hay's \\"Wisdom Cards\\".  I just like the way she explains things and the way she teaches we should live our life.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Every couple of years or so, SOAD comes out with a new CD and I fall in love all over again. This album is no exception. The lyrics still don't make much sense to me but it really doesn't matter! The lead singers voice is so beautiful (though, he is not that strong of a presence in this album ) and the music is so good they could sing \\"wangdoodle corn sticks\\" (SOAD: feel free to copy that) and the album would still be great. Here is what I think of each song on \\"Mezmerize\\": <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side-Leads into the next song really well( short and sweet) <br /> <br />2. BYOB-Angry, how I like em. Lots of lead singer. Good beat and chorus. <br /> <br />3. Revenga- Up tempo and fun to sing.  <br /> <br />4. Cigaro- Makes me laugh and is bleepin GREAT! For those of you who liked Pogo from Toxicity, you will also like this one.  <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video- Cool, has some new sounds in it; Ukelele?; the chorus sounds sort of like Ska or Reggae: good song <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine...- The lead singer does his fast singing in this one. Very headbangable. I think you could even breakdance to it..thats funny. <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography- this song makes me laugh too. Maybe I'm just immature. Anyways, freakin' sweet song. Definetely could do some of my white people moves to this.  <br /> <br />8. Question!- Sort of Ballad-like (except not corny). Very cool. Lead singer does some of his beautiful singing. <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue- Time for a Moshpit. (always wear protection kids) upbeat and angry..then slow..then fast again. <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood- Whoa! This song sounds like it is from the 80s. But a freakin sweet 80s! Mr. Roboto meets metal. <br /> <br />11. Lost in Hollywood- Don't feel this song. It bores me. But it can stay on the album to balance out all the freakin sweet. <br /> <br />
B00005A3KS|3.0|So why did he have to make a decision of shooting him or pulling the chute?  How about shooting him, dropping the gun and then pulling the chute with the SAME hand?  There's poor scriptwriting and then there's this.  If you enjoy action/aventure, then it probably won't matter.  But if you enjoy solid scriptwriting, you could find much better in this genre even.  It was fast-paced and exciting, I'll give it that, but come on.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I had the extreme pleasure to see this concert live on March 16th of this year along with a great seat up front and eye level with the guys. A dream come true, three hours of live Eagle music.  Can you beat a live concert?  No, but the accompanying DVD is a wonderful memory of that night. <br /> <br />Don Henley mentioned that this could possibly be the final tour depending on their future schedules and Farewell I is actually \\"tongue in cheek\\".  So for those reviewers who did not hear their favorite Eagles song--maybe you will during the Farewell II tour. <br /> <br />I have been an Eagles and Poco fan for more than 25 years.  My only complaint with the Eagles is that they do not allow Timothy B. Schmit to sing more.  He has a wonderful, pure voice and can contribute so much more than just being \\"the ribbon on their package\\". <br /> <br />If you are an Eagles fan, I recommend buying the DVD you won't be sorry. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Super crappy supernatural thriller that makes a fine comic book into a sham with a horrible performance by Keanu Reeves and sub par special effects that are an insult to a lot of the technical wizards working in Hollywood now.  To call this movie an insult to their craft is an understatement and pretty pathetic considering how lazy the production of this film really was.  I have heard a lot of praise about Rachel Weisz's performance, and she deserves all of it because she is the only good thing this movie really has. She's so good in fact that you do feel sorry for her for even putting in an effort to give the audience someone to cheer for.    Too bad the rest of the movie was not as professional as her performance was.
0345440900|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I'm really glad she did.  I read this in the first few weeks after my son was born.  I wasn't an overly worried parent, but I was a newcomer to this gig and was willing to get any advice I could.  This book was helpful and worked for us.<br /><br />Tracy Hogg breaks the art of calming your baby and learning how to deciper crys and what the baby wants into groups.  Obviously, not every baby is going to fit into a mold because the world doesn't work that way, but you can take a little from one type and a little from the other and form a technique that works for you as a parent.  Her ideas on setting a routine for baby each time they wake up worked wonderfully for us.  Babies like to know what is next so that they can fall into a pattern, a routine.  She's not trying to teach you how to be a parent, but how to cope in the beginning and not drive yourself and the baby crazy.<br /><br />I've read some other reviews on this page.  It seems that most people are picking on one point from the book and focusing their dislike on that, whether it be her view on nursing, or putting each child into a \\"mold\\" or \\"group\\".  If you read this book with an open mind and open heart to learning how to decipher your baby's cries or needs it can be helpful and a tool to learn about your baby.  Don't use this is a be-all, end-all for parenting, but just a guide to start you off on the right foot.
B000002UJQ|5.0|And that is only if you have ears that are mature and open enough for fine music. Beautifully produced , sombre, fractured, delicate, and just enjoyable. My favourite tune is Subterranean Homesick Alien. Let Down is also beautiful.  This album is placed at #162 on Rolling Stone 500. It should be in the top 100. And I also think this album has a slight edge on The Bends. <br /> These guys really knew what they were doing. It will take a long time for another band like Radiohead to come along. Almost ALL albums out these days are Garbage. The Rolling Stone 500 list is just as solid now as it was back in Dec. of 2003, because crap like Norah Jones, Avril Lavigne and countless other non-musical commercial outfits are promoting acoustical retardation an illness that has ravaged the narrow minded American youth. Sorry..Im done...this album ...5 stars.
B000002WUD|5.0|Well, This following the essential 50's and 60's, is a excellant representation of the Kings final decade, from tear jerker ballads, to country, to pure rock n roll, This time period is ofte underrated, but produced many great songs for the King.An Awsome live disc displays some killer tuens and great versions of classic songs, definatly a must!!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Wow, Riv i have respect for you, but you have made the biggest music listener's mistake. You have labeled this band, and under what 'Death Metal'.  First off, i hate all labels, im conservative, but i truly believe everyone can do without them.  This music is a fusion of the past and present, you have the ranting and raving attitude as seen in the albums listed by Riv and you have the new generation of (God forgive me for labeling) 'Nu-Metal'.  Seriously, if you dont like it, dont listen.  Corey's vocals are pretty amazing, as you can see his transition from this album to Vol. 3.  The album was extremely amazing and uplifting, made you want to fight.  The drumming was amazing and by far one of the greatest.  It's just so hypnotic. Riv, man, you gotta give the new generation a chance.  (Sorry again) 'Death Metal' is pretty good, and i own a lot of albumsin the genre, but personally, most of the time i have no idea what the singer is saying.  Take Behemoth or Cradle of Filth for example, both amazing instrumentally, but lacking in pronounciation.  When i listen to death metal, i listen for music and if i could, i would abandon their vocals.  With this new generation and bands like slipknot, you get both intense instruments and understandable lyrics.  Forgive the labeling, because music should not be about it, it's about free expression. and i personally feel that if you dont like it put it down, because if you jump into something that you know you wont like, you are just punishing yourself.  All music is great, JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE. Music needs to be solely emotive, if not then it is not music.  Just listen, and make your own chose.  But the cd was intense and worth every cent.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watch TV and I never write reviews on Amazon . . . until now. A friend encouraged me to watch this and it's by far the best, most clever, most endearing, highest quality entertainment I've ever seen. It's heartbreaking that it was cancelled. I'm doing everything I can to let the producers know they should resume this series!
B00005A46T|2.0|Sorry to say, but Slipknot has matured with their new album, and i have matured along with it.  Don't get me wrong i still listen to self-titled but i love their new cd.  The thing is though, IOWA displays too many similar emotions as in self-titled.  To me it is just the same.  I give my respect to 'My Plague', 'EVERYTHING ENDS,' 'Left Behind', 'The Shape', and maybe, MAYBE 'I am Hated' (only because i truly love the idea of being hated over loved).  The songs that i noted in the last sentence are really the only songs that have a sliver of originality, but other than that i say 'Stick with self-titled'.  Iowa & SElf-titled are on a different page from Vol. 3. Vol. 3 is too mature for the beat em up albums of slipknot's past. Self-T and iowa should not be compared to Vol. 3, because it is just too diff.  Iowa is okay, but too many songs are just similar, so it's not for me.  If you loved the tantrum-driven antics of this self-titled then i guess you'll like self-titled.  So choose what you like, HARD AND HEAVY or MATURE AND HEAVY, lol! Thx for listening! <br /> <br />+I have been lenient for this album, look 4/14 songs are good, but i gave it 2/5, NOTE THIS PLZ, and actually list to the music and not the lyrics!
B0006L0LOS|1.0|What a nightmare.  Somebody pinch me and wake me up.  That's what I kept thinking while watching this movie, which turned out to be a truly painful experience.  And I'm not generally a conspiracy theorist, but after enduring \\"Catwoman,\\" directed by Pitof (who? who?), I'm convinced that someone (or ones) are out to sabotage the careers of both Halle Berry and Sharon Stone (not to mention Benjamin Bratt).  It's one thing to set out to make a \\"B\\" movie, but to waste such talent and beauty through sustained incompetence (yes, sustained, this movie wasn't filmed in a single day, was it?  Come to think of it, maybe it was...) is nothing short of criminal (cinematically speaking).    I do not like to dwell on the negative aspects of any film, and I always attempt to seek out the positive (even most bad movies have something good in them, though you often have to look hard and deep to find it), but in fairness to Halle Berry, it must be noted how badly the script, editing, graphics and visual f/x, choreography and the director-- especially the director-- failed her here.      This misfire shouldn't allow us to forget Berry's excellent performances in such films as \\"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge\\" and \\"Monster's Ball,\\" for which she deservedly was awarded an Oscar for Best Actress.  The extent of her talent is undeniable and evidenced by the fact that her presence alone can add the necessary spark and elevate the stature of movies like \\"Bulworth\\" and \\"Die Another Day.\\"  So the million dollar question is, how did she wind up in this embarrassment?  She (as well as the audience) deserves better.  Obviously, she put her trust in the wrong people this time around, and at the top of that list is the \\"director\\" of this mishmash, Pitof.    I guess the lesson here is that even a major star should be wary when approached with a project that's been placed in the hands of someone whose name sounds like one of those ridiculous vanity plates you try to figure out while sitting at a red light and staring at the car in front of you.  To put this as nicely as possible, Pitof (who? what does that MEAN?) didn't have a clue about what to do with this film, and especially with his actors.  How could this have happened?  He's given all the ingredients (Berry, Stone, Bratt, big budget) to make a prize winning cake and he turns out a lump unfit for consumption.    Add to Pitof's incompetence a laughably bad script (even the ability on the part of the viewer to suspend disbelief won't help with this one), bad editing and exceptionally poor computer graphics and visual f/x that look like something left over from the Stone Age of technology (when Catwoman is bounding and leaping about it has the appearance of an early generation video game; she looks more like a frog than a cat) you have a film that should be expunged from the resumes of everyone involved.      But, like I said, even a bad movie can have a high note if you look for it, which brings me to the only redeeming aspect of this film, the performance by Alex Borstein as Sally, one of Catwoman's co-workers.  Best known as the voice of Lois Griffin in TVs \\"The Family Guy,\\" Borstein has a charismatic presence that, within the context of this film at any rate, outshines even Berry and Stone.  Better off for all concerned had this movie been titled \\"Sally,\\" with Borstein given top billing and accordant screen time.    Unfortunately, too, for all concerned, \\"Catwoman\\" will enjoy it's full nine lives on the shelves of video stores everywhere.  Just keep in mind, when you come to this shelf, pick up \\"The Cat's Meow,\\"  \\"The Cat In the Hat,\\" \\"Cat People.\\" \\"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,\\" or anything with \\"Cat\\" in the title that isn't followed by \\"Woman.\\"  Take it from me, you'll feel a lot better in the morning.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I\\"m all for free speech, but i really dislike when ppl dog an album when it is really good.  I personally believe this album, the new mudvayne album, the new papa roach album are worth listening to.  They show a new side of the artist, and in my eyes these bands have matures really well.  I love everyone of these songs on this album (and i actually found out that Prelude had lyrics, lol).  I know those metalheads wanted another dose of 'Slipknot-Self-Titled' or 'Iowa', but i just think those ppl just want to stay in one mindset.  I cant describe what goes thru my mind when i listen to this album, i can just say that despite that i loved their previous albums, i believe this album contains the most effort from the band.  Joey roars thru with some more amazing drumming, and corey has gained some more respect with his vocal range.  And from the extended Vol. 3, 'Scream' is one of their greatest.  Never have i heard a dual-chorus pulled off by this band before, it is just amazing.  I dont like that this band is scorned as 'sellouts', i do consider that they are mainstream now.  But if you really do not like those big corporations that run tho show, i say 'dont buy the cd, listen to it from someone else, and go to the concerts.' I used to hate concerts but i have realized that the only way to support the band truly is to hear them in person.  We need to get rid of all these labels. NO MORE 'nu-metal, metal, hvy. metal, black metal, death metal, transmetal, metalcore, hxc, rapcore, etc.' WHATEVER! Can't anyone see that it has ran our minds.  I'm conservative as the next guy but i thought that rock, no 'music' in general is about free speech and abandoning those labels and not giving into them.  It seems like our generation of rockers have done the opposite, WE HAVE TAKEN IN THOSE LABELS. Seriously though, just relate a band to another band, or relate a band to a fusion of two other artists. <br />  Besides the politics, i say listen to this album if you want a more matureslipknot. If you want to stay in the past with Self-titled and Iowa, then i say STAY AWAY because you might just become part of another mass that hates something. <br />  Here's what i say: <br /> <br />Prelude (4/5): once i found out that this song had lyrics i listened thru, and i loved it.  It's so melodramatic that you'll have to love it.  Listed to Corey's voice, he's telling you that this band has grown. <br />Blister Exists (4/5): Great drumming, simple drum roll, but damn it's addictive.  I AM THE DAMAGED ONE, ALL MY LIFE AND THE DAMAGE DONE!!! <br />Three Nil (4/5): Very simplistic emotion of the song, but one line saved this song for me 'THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU LOVE ME IS BECAUSE I'M HATED BY ALL!' great lyric, brings the young slipknot out of the band but the melody still tells you that this is a whole new story. <br />Duality (5/5): a week after listening to this songs i checked the play count on my iTunes, and DAMN, it was at the top.  One of the greatest, if not the greatest pulled out by Slipknot. Sorry to say, but i think this was their greatest on the album (but this is before the extended cd came out) <br />Opium of the Ppl (4/5): Great opening, really sturs the blood. <br />Circle (5/5): another notification that this band has changed drastically. <br />Welcome (5/5): all i have to say is 'WELCOME TO ANNILHILATION' <br />Vermillion (5/5): Another great, it's love and it's true face. <br />Pulse of the Maggots (5/5): in every slipknot fans heart there is a maggot, mine grew into a fly and laid more maggots, lol.  This song shows that a maggot can become something great and it know where it came from, and it will fight for the little man any day of the weak.  After listening to this song, i gave up my HARD A$$ routine and started stopping bullying and fights at school. <br />Before I Forget (5/5): I could not believe that this cd did not let up by now, another great, brings out some new emotions. <br />Vermillion PT. 2 (5/5): I never thought a sequel to another song could sound so well.  Corey is a bad mutha with his vocal range. <br />The Nameless (4/5): this is the only song that kinda made me feel iffy at first, but once i made it thru the awkward beginning i loved the little soft parts.  Sent chills down my back. <br />The Virus of Life (3.5/5): I believe this is the only part of the cd that was bad, it just is a run-around song, no complexity, but whateva, i sing to it all the time, I brings out some gothic feelings. <br />Danger- Keep Away (4/5): hmmmm, alright i guess <br /> <br />The CD was truly a new page for slipknot, and the band members can still hold their ground pretty well.  Everyband member kinda had their own little part for themself in the cd, which i feel is a great improvement.  SLIPKNOT WILL ALWAYS BE THE BAND THAT BROUGHT ME INTO THIS FORM OF MUSIC.  If these guys win a grammy, i wont mind, they're good, and this album reach a broader audience.  I listen to a lot of underground now, but there are some really good bands that have made it mainstream, it is just a path they chose.  I feel it is time that a lot of music listeners mature too, they need to overcome the simplistic urge to through their tantrums and learn to appreciate music for what it is. <br />  Besides my review, music should be driven by emotion.  I do believe that some artists under the label of \\"r&B, rap, etc\\" have just sang about simple things with no emotions (like getting rich or ranting on another artist).  I'm just saying that the music you choose to listen to you is your business. If it were up to me, i would say dont read my review, because i do not want to control your decision, just listen to this album if you want a mature slipknot. THx for listening.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Wonderful sequel to the Wizard of Oz.  Don't expect the same look and feel to the 1939 original.  This one stands alone.  Wonderful characters, great set.  I loved this as a teen ... haven't seen it in a while but would gladly buy it for a dvd collection.  I just love the characters and even the creative names of the characters.  Love the Nome King, Tick Tock, Belina .... The Deadly Desert ... Jack ...<br /><br />I just loved this movie!
0446310786|4.0|To kill a mocking bird was a good book because it taught you some new lessons and it showed you the troubles of being racist and it shows you other ways to avoid it.It also has other many good lessons to it and its an exciting book for many kids of any age.Well in conclusion i think people should buy the book and read it.
B000065U1N|5.0|I recently viewed this movie and was stunned.  It was very realistic and shows what happens when the politicians run a war. It's definitely a reminder as to what our military does, and does well.         The movie start off by naming some statistics of dead Somalians who have starved and some information about Muhhamad Farrah Aidid, a warlord, that seizes international food shipments.  The U.S. Rangers are called in to capture Aidid and restore order. They are instructed to capture prisoners in the heart of the hostile city: Mogadishu. The big problem that lead to the disaster would be that the Rangers were not allowed any Corporate Gunships or tanks  (thanks goes to the politicians)----just hummers and Black Hawks.  If they were allowed these vehicles, victory would have happened.         The whole operation goes bad after multiple helicopters and hummers are taken out by RPG's (Rocket Propeled Grenades)and thousands of militia attack from everywhere.  The rest of the movie is about the rescue of soldiers from the helicopters and an attempt to retreat out of the danger zone.         Very realistic fighting blends with just-as-realistic weaponry.  The helicopters are great (real ones were actually used) as are the vehicles.           Black Hawk Down is a fantastic movie that shows how great our military is.  Be sure to buy this movie soon; you will not be disappointed.
0671027344|4.0|It was a pretty descent book. A lot of peer pressure incidents in it which includes drugs and sexual activity. Also much disaster in the kids past life like being molestered by his aunt and not remembering it every Saturday. Also the thought of being a \\"teachers pet\\" and the overall being friends with his teacher. Well if your looking for a book that has a gay guy in it this is the book for you. The gay guy is not the main character but is a good friend.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|I'm a fan of Katie's and really enjoyed this movie.  Forrest Whittaker did a great job with the direction and Michael Keaton was so sweet as the dad.  Very uplifting feel good movie!
B0006399FS|5.0|This is the latest fare from the rock'n'roll survivors of 25 odd years and tears. 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' was released with fans nervously not knowing what to expect. And the band delivers with another epic release. I have read the latest reviews below me and I am wondering if they have listened to the same CD I have countless times. The CD has 11 songs and 7 of them are absolute gems and pays homage and fealty to us loyal fans who have stuck through thick and thin with this Irish band from Dublin.<br /><br />What would a listener expect of a band that has been around for 25 or so years with the same band members over time? Success and beautiful music....and we get both with the first song on this amazing CD 'Vertigo' that starts the album off in a high paced symphony. But the best song on this album is the romantically minded song 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' - not since the song 'With Or Without You' has such a lovely serenade been sung. 'City Of Blinding Lights' & 'All Because Of You' are pure adrenalin for rock'n'roll fans. 'One Step Closer' is another nice song with wonderful lyrics about being in love. All in all I feel that U2 have once again delivered with this stellar CD. Beautiful album from a well laid out band.
B00005JMJG|5.0|There hasn't been a movie ever since Pulp Fiction that has really made me watch with full attention not knowing what to expect in the next scene. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a genius form of storytelling.  <br />The movie is simply a love story but with an original plot and excellent performances by the two lead stars Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) and Kate Winslett (Titanic), Sunshine is an instant classic. <br /> <br />The movie might be a little awkward, but the detailed direction of Michael Gondry gives you no excuse not to be able to follow along understanding what is going on. The film is about a shy man named Joel who meets an eccentric girl named Clementine (like the song!) and immediately they fall in love. <br /> <br />Clementine's behavior takes a toll with Joel who begins distrusting her, so Clementine leaves him and erases him out of her memory with the help of Doctor Howard Mierzwiak, played by Oscar winner Tom Wilkinson. Joel goes crazy as a result and ends up at the same doctor's office to have his memory cleaned up of all memory of Clementine. <br /> <br />Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind from here on. The essence of the picture is that Joel realizes, as his treasured memories of Clementine begin to fade away one after the other, that he still loves Clementine and attempts to get out of the procedure before it's too late. <br /> <br />Jim Carrey is quite surprising in his dramatic, but funny, turn. A turn that will most definitely earn him Hollywood praise (and a golden statue!) in the future. Winslett, who was nominated for Best Actress for her work here, is incredibly convincing and proves to be perfect competition for Carrey. <br /> <br />Eternal Sunshine is by far one of the best movies of the past ten years. <br /> <br />Highly recommended <br /> <br />A+
B000001FS3|5.0|This album 'Joshua Tree' is a facinating exciting album by U2 that was first released in 1982 but to this time and era sounds great still. Three of the best of all time U2 songs are at the start of the album and these are the everlasting successful songs of 'Where The Streets Have No Name' that focuses on humanities ill-will against each other. The second song 'I Still Haven't Found What I Am Looking For', is a gorgeous song sung poetically by Bono. Probably one of my best U2 songs I have put in my top 5 songs is the romantic balad of 'With Or Without You'. I listened to this song just after a recent break-up with a gal and wow did the song lyrics justify what I felt.<br /><br />This is a comparatively slow CD for the likes of U2. This Brittish band has shown they can mesh together many music genres and sounds and come out with a end product that'll always dazzle the listener - us. The slowest song of the CD but one of the most powerful songs lyrically is 'In God's Country'. This is a must buy CD for any U2 fan. You will love this great range CD like I have.
B000001FO4|3.0|They certainly had \\"the hair\\" but are they a hair band? The music here would suggest Cinderella isn't sure. There are touches of blues influence that suggest they'd like to evolve into Aerosmith territory, gritty AC/DC crunch, flashy pop metal choruses a la Jovi in spots, and the requisite \\"chick appeal\\" power ballads all 80s metal albums seemed to have.<br /><br />The band is vocalist/guitarist Tom Keifer, bassist Eric Brittingham, Jeff LaBar on rhythm guitar (was there a law that hair metal bands had to have a guy with a French name?), and Fred Coury adding \\"more cowbell\\" and skins. Rick Criniti pads the sound with B3, piano and synth for the power ballads. Musically, they're competent but there's a lot more \\"flash\\" than expertise.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />Road anthem \\"Gypsy Road\\" has a pretty decent hook and some clever lyrics for heavy metal (\\"I'm drivin' all night/Just to keep the rat in the race\\"). It sounds like a collision of AC/DC and Ratt. \\"Don't Know What you Got (Til' it's Gone)\\" is the one that gave them the hairband reputation and it's definitely a formula power ballad, though better than others of the ilk (Steelheart this means you...). \\"Second Wind\\" is one of the better ones musically with its shifting time signatures though the lyric's a shopworn \\"I can take what you dish out\\" metal number. After catching their (wait for it....) second wind, Keifer and company ride an instrumental jam out at the coda. Is it just me or does \\"If You Don't Like It\\" steal the beginning of \\"Eye of the Tiger\\"?  Once that section's over, it heads straight into Aerosmith territory. \\"Fire and Ice\\" could be an AC/DC outtake. It's straight-ahead bluesy power chords with Keifer in full Brian Johnson howl made.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />The title track musically is perfectly restrained anguish, like a slow Clapton blues number, but Keifer's screechy overblown vocal is way too cartoonish to make this heartfelt. It has all the subtlety of a daisy cutter bomb. \\"Coming Home\\" sounds like Brian Johnson fronting a generic Bon Jovi song. At 27, Keifer's already begging someone to \\"Take me Back\\" to help him recapture \\"yesterday's desire\\"? Isn't that a bit young to be a has-been?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />It's OK but nothing you probably can't live without. If you're an AC/DC fan wanting something else for the collection, you may like enough of these tracks to pick it up. Better than most of the hair crowd, though.<br /><br />2 1/2 starseneric Bon Jovi song. At 27, Keifer's already begging someone to \\"Take me Back\\" to help him recapture \\"yesterday's desire\\"?

B0006L16N8|5.0|i've been listening to coldplay since parachutes. i'm a fan of that type of music. the most innovative, brilliant music comes from england. right now, the only band that can really compare to coldplay is radiohead. there's a lot of coldplay fans out there that jumped on the bandwagon after \\"clocks\\" - but there's also a lot of us who have been following this band form the get go, and like me, are happy to see this talented group of musicians finally make it big throughout the world. x+y is a fantastic album. it takes off from where rush of blood to the head ends and does a good job of mixing in classic parachutes era coldplay with rush of the blood and a newer direction, shwoing some great influences along the way, notably radiohead and echo and the bunnymen. speed of sound was a great first single but it barely etches the surface of what this album is all about. probably the strongest track on here is talk. it reminds one of a in my place and god put a smile upon your face. this is what coldplay does best: one part emotional digression, one part drum smashing, one part guitar driven rock. twisted logic is amazing. it is borderline neds/ok computer radiohead. chris martin's voice has never sounded better. and if you've ever seen coldplay live, then you know how great they really are in person - they are truly talented musicians. coldplay have suceeded because they are very good and they don't go on about it (see: oasis). another standout track is fix you, which is bound to become as infamous as the scientist. square one is a good song, but i don't think it should have opened the album. on rush of blood to the head, politik smashed into your ears the same way planet telex did on radiohead's the bends.  <br /> <br />overall a smashing album from a band that is destined to become the biggest talent of our generation. great work lads.
068987474X|5.0|Someone please give the authors of this book the Nobel Peace Prize for giving women worldwide who angst over men peace of mind.  <br /> <br />We have all angsted over men - Will he call? Why does he not call? Should I call him? Oh, maybe he lost my number so let me call him? We have also wasted time over men who are just not worth all the effort, ate too much ice cream because of things they did or didn't do and drove our friends crazy dissecting every comment made by a guy to try to understand what they meant.  <br /> <br />The authors have now answered all the questions ever asked and reinforced something we always knew but didn't quite get - he needs to chase, and if he doesn't - He's Just Not that Into You, so you go off and enjoy your life and yourself!  <br /> <br />There is something strangely empowering about this message. I met this really cute Israeli guy, I mean REALLY CUTE. We talked, flirted and he asked for my number, which I duly programmed into his cell. I don't know how many days it has been, and he has not called.  <br /> <br />The old me would have pressed the \\"dial\\" button on his cell after programming my number so as to call my cell from his cell so his number would appear in my cell. The post \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" me didn't. The old me would have angsted, fussed, called all my good girl friends for advice, disregarded their advice and called him. The post \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" me spent the time quite happily doing none of those. If he calls, great, we can go out and have a great time. If he doesn't, it's also great.  <br /> <br />I finally got the message that my life is too precious to be wasted angsting, fussing etc. In short - Don't Waste The Pretty. I don't think I am the only person who finally got this message after reading the book. We always knew this, but the book makes sure you REALLY GET IT.  <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|I'm not into harder rock, and much of the stuff today doesn't appeal to me.  Much of today's music seems immature.  To me, \\"immature\\" music just goes in one ear and out the other.  It doesn't age well.  'Exile' is harder than other stuff I listen to, but not just obnoxiously loud and crowded.  <br />          <br />This CD, \\"Out of Exile\\" takes several listen-throughs (kind of like a good movie-where you notice new things every time you watch it) in order to grasp the brilliance of it. I had the same experience with \\"Stand up\\" by DMB.  Many reviewers of both have hateful things to say, but this must not be their genre, because it is tight and unique, but reminds me of bands like Led Zeppelin and even the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Each song is unique, but share great instrumentals and vocals/lyrics. <br />         <br />  I haven't listened to most of Audioslave's debut album, but I plan on buying it soon.  I don't know about the rest of the songs on \\"Audioslave\\", but the tracks on this CD sound much different than \\"Shadow on the Sun\\", and \\"Like a Stone\\".  After buying \\"Stand Up\\", \\"X&Y\\", and \\"Burning in the Sun\\" this year, this CD is the PERFECT refreshing experience for me.  I've found yet another band to love, but one that doesn't sound like any of the music I've listened to (Modern band-wise).   <br />         <br />  Finally, some reviewers mention (or rant ) that Chris Cornell sounds like the vocalist from Creed, and that the \\"soft\\" sound is like that of the backstreet boys.  After listening to this CD, that seems really stupid and baseless.  My mom, who's been having headaches, can't stand the intense sounds of Audioslave, which \\"hurt her head\\", although she has no problem with any of my other CDs.

B0009HLDFU|3.0|This is a good album and i'm glad to see that the Foo Fighters still have it, although the second disc does tend to drag a bit it still worth the 18 bucks or so, one of the FEW CD's that is. Record companies and coporate pigs run the show for all these bands say wanh wanh wanh we aren't getting our royalties. All the while we work our little 9 to 5 existences while they live it up out in Beverly Hills, uhh yeah it really looks like these \\"rock stars\\" are really hurting(NOT). There real money is made on tour. And if anything Downloading has created a larger fan base for more unheard of, obscure type band than ever before. Also the BS of paying 20 dollars for a CD that you don't even know if you'll like or if you'll like one song and then put it on the shelf to collect dust is totally ludicrous. I've been downloading for many years and will continue to do so without any guilt, want CD sales back up?? Lower the damn prices. Also it isn't stealing, its sharing, remember making audio tapes off the radio as a kid, (gee did we have the copyrights to that umm nope)...(movies off HBO and SHOWTIME, nope no copyrights there for us either). So get your facts straight and know that this kind of thing has been going on since the invention of the VCR, but i didn't hear anyone saying THAT was stealing, so download and be happy, after they demolish one service another will magicically appear:) Don't let the RIAA take away your freedom of privacy, because thats what they are trying to take away with all this COPYRIGHT protection, oh and minus one star for the Foo Fighters doing this to the CD, shame on you. I won't purchase another either. Later
B00003CXAT|5.0|There's basically 2 kind of summer blockbusters: the big visually impressive film, and thrill rides that gets adrenaline pumping. The first one is kind of hollow; it's not as emotional or gripping but it looks spectacular. Examples are the recent Star Wars films and Independence Day. The latter half are the edge-of-your-seat types and Spielberg is best when he does these kind. Yeah Private Ryan and Schindler's List are great films but they're more \\"arty\\" than entertaining. And so we have Jurassic Park, which has oddly bad pacing but still great suspense. Phew.  <br /> <br />John Hammond is part of a genetic breakthrough: he's successfully brought back dinosaurs to life using a technique which integrates their DNA with that of frogs to fill in sequence gaps. He's on the verge of completing a theme park which has the dinosaurs has a zoo-like environment but an accident forces him to get experts to visit the island and say everything's fine. So he sends Ellie a paleobotanist(plant life), Grant(dinosaur bones/anatomy) Malcolm(chaotician, think Butterfly Effect) and 2 of Hammond's kids. <br /> <br />Everything runs smoothly until a money-hungry computer programmer named Nedry decides to steal the valuable dino embryos and smuggle them to another company, plus a hurricane that's heading right for them. Nedry disabled the electronic systems so the dinosaurs can roam wherever they want; not good for our human heroes. So it's a race to get back to the mainland without being eaten. <br /> <br />The film like I said has bad pacing, it takes awhile to set up the story/events than whoosh, 3 major sequences than pretty much nothing with little specks here and there until the end. Where the film succeeds is the effects and the suspense. These dinosaurs really look great and it's hard to find any scenes with bad CG/puppet work. <br /> <br />As for the big scenes, they're quite thrilling. The first major one is when the cars stop(rather conveniently) right smack in the middle of theT-Rex pen which he escapes from. Played without music(unlike the trailer scene in the sequel), it has that feeling of not wanting to do anything but watch the scene. And the raptors are just as freaky as ever with fast running and big jumping, which they don't show off fully till the sequel. <br /> <br />Spielberg in some ways has a knack for directing kids. Drew Barrymore in ET, Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds and Haley Joel Osment in A.I. but unfortunately the kids are quite annoying, but that's their job in the film but still. The other performances are great as well. And if the Star Wars and Jaws theme are his most popular, then Jurassic Park is probably 3rd(unless you count those 5 notes from Close Encounters). <br /> <br />Yeah it's bad pacing, there's a ton of goofs and you gotta turn your brain off slightly but what better way to be thrilled than with this. Even if it is 12 years old.
B0007TKNIS|3.0|The movie is very close to the play. All the songs are there. Unfortunately, the actors' voices are dissapointing. The phantom, especially, could use at least ten more years of music lessons. <br /> <br />Also, the movie does not have the dark quality of the play. Bright lights and colors make it more of a farce than a frightening and mysterious experience.
B000929AJQ|4.0|So... Nine Inch Nails is finally back. The mega-hyped, mega-delayed, mega-anticipated album With Teeth finally reached the public, and reviews so far have been mixed, to say the least. It has been called genius, a masterpiece, a rehash, so-so, and terrible. These differing opinions make sense because, as usual, With Teeth sounds nothing like any other NIN release. Personally, I admire the fact that Trent Reznor is not coasting on the same themes and sounds and is trying something new. As far the music on the album goes, it is, for the most part, strong, with some of the best tracks NIN has put down. Track by track is really the only way to dissect it, as the album is immensely varied (although focused). <br /> <br />All The Love In The World - For the first time ever, a NIN album doesn't open with a loud punch in the face. This very chilled-out song is excellent, driven by gentle techno beats until the end, when it reaches a dramatic sing-a-long. Awesome. <br /> <br />You Know What You Are - The heaviness starts here, with the sound of Dave Grohl assaulting his drum set with an almost death metal double bass rhythm. Although the song is angry and well put together, it just doesn't quite of the spark of \\"Wish\\" or \\"March Of The Pigs\\". It's a good track, but not one I'd imagine listening to again and again. <br /> <br />The Collector - A basic rock song, with basic NIN tricks and lyrics. The time signature is actually the reverse of \\"The Becoming\\", alternating measures of 7 and 6. The piano ending is a nice touch, but there isn't a whole lot amazing stuff going on. <br /> <br />The Hand That Feeds - A custom-made-for-radio rock song, it's like \\"The Collector\\" with a slick synth solo and a catchier chorus. Good, but not fantastic. <br /> <br />Love Is Not Enough - A mediocre first few tracks gives way to this, the worst song on the album. Completely bland and lifeless, with atypical Reznor lyrics, this is one of the few NIN songs I dislike entirely. Skip to the next one. <br /> <br />Every Day Is Exactly The Same - Thankfully, Reznor bounces back with one of the best songs on the album and of his carrer. A strong, vocal-based tune with a wonderful chorus. Will definately become a classic.  <br /> <br />With Teeth - This song is just weird. It lumbers along in a herky-jerky fashion through the verses, contains a gentle piano bridge, and includes the most outright ridculous chorus I've ever heard. Someone needs to take Trent's Metallica CD's away from him. <br /> <br />Only - Well, I don't think anyone in hell saw this song coming. The secong single is 80's, synthesized, super new wave. And it is GREAT. This beyond-creative track featured hilarious and poignent spoken word vocals, and a slap bass-meets-Billie Jean backdrop. Starting from here, the rest of the album is amazing. <br /> <br />Getting Smaller - The second really heavy song, this is much more exciting than YKWYA. The chorus explodes in a wall of noise, and the guitars and vocals are charged with energy. Very good. <br /> <br />Sunspots - A very dark, very cool song. It starts with low bass lines and a weird falsetto chorus, then explodes into a whole other section with the famous lyric, \\"Nothing can stop me now\\". After a strange nosie interlude, Trent finishes the song screaming a whole new part. Truly wicked. <br /> <br />The Line Begins To Blur - The last three songs kind of meld into a trilogy. This track, the first part, is almost perfect. It opens in classic NIN fashion, with pounding beats, strange electronic glitches, and Trent screaming his head off. Then the chorus does a complete 180, entering a melodic, surreal daydream. One of the best NIN songs ever. <br /> <br />Beside You In Time - This is the only song that really has any resemblance With Teeth's predecessor, The Fragile. It's very atmospheric and trippy, slowly building up steam. And towards the end, it explodes in a gigantic crunch of guitar and synth. A perfect blend of the epic rage of TLBTB and the gentle serenity of the next track. <br /> <br />Right Where It Belongs - Adding to the list of \\"Hurt\\" and \\"The Great Below\\", this peaceful ballad ends the album. The music blends a pretty piano with strange, almost mechanical keyboard sounds, showcasing NIN trademark of blending organic sound with electronic nuances. Trent sings a beautiful melody, and the song has a calm feel. Very good, although not quite in the league of the two aforementioned ballads. <br /> <br />So there you have it. With Teeth encompasses the personal songwriting and electronia of Pretty Hate Machine, the angst-fueled rock of Broken, the deranged industrial-pop of The Downward Spiral, and just a little of the sweeping epic drama of The Fragile. It doesn't rank as NIN's best achievment, and some songs range from mediocre to just plain bad. But for the most part, With Teeth is a successful attempt by a massively popular and accomplished artist to break his own mold and create a work of art unlike anything he has previously done. It begs the question of how will the next Nine Inch Nails release will sound, wich is set for release in 2016. Enjoy.
B0007GAERG|5.0|MARIAH THANK YOU..YOU HAVE MADE THE SUMMER FUN WITH THIS NEW ALBUM.
B0000026CM|5.0|In my opinion, this is by far the best TOTO album ever released. It has that big, late-80's sound that I love more than anything. And it has nothing but great songs - well written, performed, arranged and engineered. <br />But most importantly - it has so much TOTO on it! <br />All the boys are at their best on this album. For me as a big fan of Jeff Porcaro it's nice to hear so many different, wonderful grooves by him on one album. <br /> <br />This album is really extraordinary and deserves way more credit than it ever got. Songs like \\"Pamela\\", \\"Stop Loving You\\" and \\"These Chains\\" are among TOTO's best songs ever. <br /> <br />A true classic that ought to be on every music lover's CD shelf.
1586210912|3.0|I have been wanting to read this for a while but couldn't find the time, so i got the audio CD instead for the car trips.  Anyway, it's OK.  I mean, I don't think i got any revelations.  Maybe I already knew most of what he said because I am interested in this genre and have read a few of these.  Given what I hear about the average american family or individual struggling with finances, I guess there's a lot to learn from him, but it just wasn't for my situation. <br /> <br />The good news is that I now have a story to teach my children as they grow up and instill in them a teaching about money.  I also got the confirmation that the most important thing is that you can't just work and save and sit on your money.  Money has to work for you.  Now I just need to get my idea going...
B0009ML238|4.0|When I got this CD and gave it a spin, I didn't find the band too entralling.  However, now, two weeks later, I can't stop listening to them and do think they have lots of potential.  This may also be because I think the music is a bit more difficult: lots of changes of tempo, rhythmically jazzy.  But it should be true of any good prog; so it's a truism.<br /><br />The band DOES sound very much like Dream Theater, as other reviewers have already noted.  Is it bad?  I personally do not think so.  I think it's quite a compliment to be compared to DT; if anything, it shows their musical virtuosity.  The vocals are quite similar as well (at times, also sound like ... Europe - remember them? :) Even when they DO sound like DT, it should be no complaint.  How many bands master that level of performance?<br /><br />In any case, I do think that this band is worth the attention.  It's funny, but you get their CD, listen to it, find it so DT-like and then you wonder what's their next album will be like; will they find their own sound/form?  Even if not, they're GOOD, the music is well-written and performed.<br /><br />Anyway, I am waiting for their next album, and hope it will be at least as good.  4 stars only for not being perfect...
B0006L16N8|4.0|This album is a balls to the wall epic mope fest for better or worse.  These guys are going for the rapturous stadium filling emotional slight of hand that lots of bands go for.  They seem to have found their influences in all the right places, Eno's 70's ambient work, Radioheads harsh prettiness, U2's embrace of embarassingly large songs.  They want you to really REALLY FEEL IT.  They succeed in parts.  Fix You gives Sigur Ros a brit-rock makeover, basically stealing Vaka's organ melody.  But as with too many Coldplay songs the music is there, the vocal melodies are there, and Chris Martin is given a big softball down the middle and he whiffs with his obvious lyrics.  It makes it hard to embrace the songs, but impossible to not at least somewhat enjoy it.  My favorites are A Message, Fix You, Square One, and the single.  There just isn't a song like Warning Sign or Amsterdam that hit hard on this album, so while its not hard to love the sound, its just not as affecting as before.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I'll start out by eliminating any misconceptions people may have. I don't care that he doesn't scream anymore. I don't care that there aren't any chugga-chug breakdowns or blast beats. I don't like that crap either. But what they've replaced it with is just as bad. <br /> <br />This album is basically an attempt at taking European power metal and repackaging for the new American metal audience. This isn't anything new; ever since metalcore began to get stale and lose its credibility (which would be about 2 months after it first appeared), bands have been discarding the 'core' and trying more and more to show much they're in touch with the original metal styles. Problem is that unlike, say, 3 Inches of Blood, who took an old genre and breathed new life into it, these guys are just releasing sub-par, watered-down versions of the originals. There isn't a shred of originality, emotion, or inspiration on this album. The only people who would have the audacity to call it original are those who just recently threw away their Korn CD's and have never heard of Helloween, Stratovarius, or any of the other bands that they're poorly trying to pay tribute to. Not to mention that his voice obviously can't handle the range required for this style and sounds laughably like a 16-year old with a sinus problem. I heard that he had throat surgery, but does that mean we have to like the music out of sheer pity? It took all the kindness I had just to listen to a few songs without plugging my ears. <br /> <br />On another note: the Manowar-style lyrics on Waking the Fallen were just barely tolerable because I thought they might be tongue-in-cheek, but looking at this album, I'm beginning to doubt that. We get it, guys. You're tough, you're evil, you're so metal. Want a cookie? <br /> <br />This is an open letter to all metalcore-trying-to-be-real-metal bands out there: don't bother. 95% of your fanbase won't have any idea of the music you're trying to emulate anyway, and to the 5% that do, you'll just look silly. And really, there's a good reason 'true' metal died - it WAS stale and repetitive. Metalcore gave metal the kick in the pants that it needed, and just because THAT's gotten stale too doesn't mean you should go back to an older, even MORE stale genre. There are way too many 'retro' bands, and it's a tired gimmick. Let's move forward, not backwards. <br /> <br />So to sum up, don't get this, it's bad, terrible, bleh. If you really want retro done right, get 3 Inches of Blood's Advance and Vanquish or just go to the originals; otherwise wait for some actually NEW music.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Trent Reznor appeared to be painting himself into a corner, even as he achieved renown; his 1999 double-album The Fragile made no substantial changes to the industrial-collage style of his 1994 breakthrough The Downward Spiral, and then he vanished off the face of the earth, seemingly out of ideas. One might expect With Teeth, the first Nine Inch Nails album in six years, to be more of the same. But \\"All The Love In The World\\" opens it with sparse, skittering drums, suggesting that Reznor has finally derived some inspiration from all of those experimental techno bands that used to be on Nothing Records, and then, completely unexpectedly, takes off with a thumping house beat, as numerous vocal overdubs are layered on top of each other. Suddenly, Trent's comeback looks interesting.    With Teeth is what you might call a \\"stripped-down\\" album, one consisting of stomping beats, some chugging bass or grinding guitar playing simple rhythms, and the occasional burst of industrial noise. Many songs sound like they could be replicated pretty well on live instruments by a reasonably energetic three-piece. But if you think about it, the music always played a secondary role in Nine Inch Nails songs. Consider \\"Sin,\\" one of Reznor's earliest singles. I can't remember a single thing about what the music in that song sounded like, but I think I've got Reznor's clear, forceful diction on the lyrics memorized to perfection. The same goes for \\"Closer,\\" Reznor's unexpected big hit: the only musical aspect of that song that sticks out in my mind is the crack of the snare in the very beginning, but it's hard to forget Reznor's seething delivery of the verses, or his broken snarl in the chorus. Trent Reznor's persona was always at the centre of Nine Inch Nails, and his music always hinged on his vocal performances. So it is with this album. The weak songs are the ones where the lyrics don't have some kind of memorable rhythmic structure, like \\"The Collector,\\" where Trent just kind of drones, \\"I pick things up / I am a collector / And things, well things, they tend to accumulate.\\"    In general, the lyrics are not the album's strongest point. Their main theme is dehumanization, common subject matter in industrial music; people are compared to \\"insects\\" that \\"march along\\" or go \\"in step, in the line,\\" and several songs talk about obeying orders or doing what one is told. This bleak state of affairs, apparently, is the fault of a vague entity known only as \\"they,\\" e.g. \\"they figured me out,\\" \\"they won't let me leave,\\" \\"they got a way of reading my mind,\\" \\"I'll hide it behind something they won't look behind.\\" Trent's conflict with these mysterious \\"they\\" is described very vaguely, even by his standard, although it is possible to read \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" as a reference to the alcohol addiction that Reznor recently overcame. A few phrases, like \\"bleeding through,\\" \\"the line begins to blur,\\" and \\"I am still inside you,\\" are used in more than one song. Trent even lifts metaphors from previous Nine Inch Nails albums; the image of \\"The Collector\\" first appeared in \\"Ruiner\\" on The Downward Spiral, and \\"nothing can stop me now\\" in \\"Sunspots\\" was a recurring phrase on that same album.    What's new here is a greater sense of self-awareness, as if Trent is openly acknowledging the theatricality of his own image, simultaneously poking a bit of fun at it and confidently displaying his own charisma. Just listen to him belt \\"with-a teeth-a\\" in the title track. Sure, he's just saying two words over and over, and they probably don't mean anything, but his voice has a swagger to it that just wasn't there before. Elsewhere, he yells \\"hey,\\" \\"uh-huh,\\" and \\"flip-flop-flip-flop-flip,\\" croons \\"hoo-hoo\\" and \\"she turns me on\\" in an impressive falsetto, and follows up a typical line like \\"I want to kill away the rest of what's left\\" with the addendum, \\"and I do, yes I do.\\" As a result, the album never feels heavy at all, despite containing plenty of distorted guitars and screaming. It feels fun. Even \\"You Know What You Are?\\" and \\"The Line Begins To Blur,\\" the two heaviest and most dissonant songs, sound almost light-hearted in parts, due to the groovy keyboard break in the former and the \\"ooh-ooh\\" ending in the latter.    Reznor's newfound good cheer really becomes evident on \\"Only.\\" This song has formless spoken-word lyrics, and Trent delivers them in a conversational manner, patiently explaining, \\"well, you might say I'm losing focus, kind of drifting in the abstract.\\" Then, when he repeats, \\"I just made you up to hurt myself,\\" it sounds like he's making up the song on the spot and can't think of a next line, so he just concludes, \\"and it worked, yes it did!\\" But this is an intended effect; in reality, the song is tight and finely crafted, with a snappy club beat and some of that Peter Hook action on the bass. The simple music creates a catchy framework for Trent's voice, like it does many times on With Teeth; the album's midsection contains a string of similar-sounding but undeniably awesome songs, like \\"Getting Smaller,\\" a potential alternative radio hit which takes a fast tempo and a brief counter-riff played after every line of lyrics, and rides them into a splendid sing-along chorus, or \\"Sunspots,\\" which is brought to a rousing conclusion by the sudden appearance of a blaring synthesizer, or \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" which tweaks the lyrical themes a bit to add a topical air.    So, With Teeth is much better than The Fragile. It is also probably more listenable and accessible than The Downward Spiral. But it will never have the cultural impact of that album, nor will it ever be the soundtrack of choice for the adolescent emotional crisis of a large and devoted following, like Pretty Hate Machine was. Even so, it's good to have Trent back.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I only hate that I did not see it <br />on the big screen.  I have watched this movie over and over and am simply captivated by Gerard Butler!  I did not think I would ever like another movie like I did Pride and Predudice (A&E) with Colin Firth, but I have.  I loved every song in it and thought Gerard's and Emmy's voices were outstanding.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a wonderful 2 hours of great entertainment.  Gerard Butler is SO sexy and handsome, even with half his face distorted.  Why Christine picked Raul over him mistifies me.  Minnie Driver was good as the diva.  Please, if you haven't seen this, GO and rent the DVD and watch. <br />You will not be disappointed!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Wow. Are there words to even describe the greatness of this cd? I can honestly say that it isnt their BEST, but that is my opinion. It is so melodic and catchy. To ANY System fan, this should be very soothing, yet it can make you get up and wanna sing out loud and go nuts. The bass, drums, lyrics, and vocals are all INCREDIBLE. This is the reason that I have been a System fan for so long. I cant stop loving them. The great intro (Soldier Side) starts off slow, and  \\"opens\\" for the widely known song \\"B.Y.O.B\\"...great guitar and bass in B.Y.O.B. It isnt my favorite though. Next comes \\"Revenga\\". What a song that makes you just wanna scream out loud and go nuts, seriously. I mean i dont go nuts, but its great to jam out to in the car. Next is \\"Cigaro\\". Great song, seriously. And NO he is not sing about THAT, he is singing about an ego-based society we have out there, and how they think that they are better, and what-not. Buy the cd and you will figure it out in good time :). Radio/Video. Awesome. It starts out semi-calm with a great beat, and explodes into \\"Hey man, look at me rockin' out\\"...Wonderful. Oh, and \\"Danny and Lisa\\" are his childhood friends when he lived overseas, and he hasnt seen them since he was about 5..Next song. \\"This cocaine makes me feel like im on this song\\". It has everything System is KNOWN for! Serj's childish voice, the awesomely bad guitar riffs, heavy bass, and the outstanding drums. I love this song. It has everything you could want from System all combined into one song. \\"Violent Pornography\\". How great is this song? And this song is pretty common for Daron to write, so I kinda expected it:) Its good though, you need to listen to this. Now, onto my favorite songs on the whole cd. \\"Question!\\"...This song has so much emotion put into the song, it seems like. I love the sound of Serj's voice when he is singing \\"Do we, do we know when we fly\\"..It is so great. Oh my god this song puts me in such a good mood when i listen to it. This is almost everything that I could want in a song combined-kinda like \\"This cocaine makes me feel like Im on this song\\", except for alot more emotion in Serj's voice, it seems like. Now, to my absolute favorite song on the cd. \\"Sad Statue\\". It starts out kinda like B.Y.O.B, but you know its not that song. It has its own way to it, and I love the lyrics and the beat. I could just drown in this song...It makes you want to play it over and over again, just to hear Serj's voice, Daron's great back-up vocals and guitaring, Shavo's awesome bass that amazes me everytime, and John's completely great way of drumming-which isnt completely unique, but is good enough that it should be :)...Next is \\"Old School Hollywood\\"..Its about a time that Daron was at a baseball game and at first he thought it would be great, and it turned out to be horrible and he got lost, etc..Its a good song though..Some of the funniest and craziest songs from System of a Down are really their most painful, sadly. \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" ..A pretty slow song for the most part..Nice how they portray Hollywood as it really is....Hollywood isnt as worked up as everyone makes it. Overall this cd is a 5 star cd review. The band deserves it, no matter what anyone else says. I love this cd, and I love this band very much. It is easy for me to respect them as artists and their music. Even if you only like System of a Down a little bit, I am sure that you will love this cd. Young or old cant resist this cd, and you shouldnt have to either. *-Buy it-*...Also check out their other 3 cds and \\"Hypnotize\\" will be out around November, so make sure you pre-order it :)...Go to [...]to learn more about System of a Down..Enjoy!
B00007ELEL|2.0|After watching Fargo, I read about this movie and thought that I should see it because I just loved Fargo. But, this movie was very strange. Very strange and weird. The cast in this movie is simply amazing with Jeff Bridges, the brilliant John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jullianne Moore and John Turturro. But, the movie just didn't do it for me. It certainly had some good jokes and great acting but it had WAY TOO MANY CURSE WORDS and was just so weird. I mean, it's weird when you see a topless lady on a trampoline going up and down on the screen. And that happened a couple of times. Weird. Also, if you decide to watch this, make sure that you aern't sensitive towards the F word because it's used A LOT. I mean, there rarely is a sentence that John Goodman or Jeff Bridges doesn't use it. When they didn't, I was like: \\"Dude! It's a miracle!\\" <br />So be prepared to hear a lot of naughty words. I mean hundreds and hundreds of them, every 10 seconds, you'll probably hear one. So, that kind of frustrated me. Also, the weirdness was like over the top. I mean it was so weird. When Jeff Bridges would be high and have those weird visions or when the topless lady would jump up and down. I mean there was some pointless and weird stuff. I guess when the dude thinks that he's flying is pretty funny.  <br />Anyway, now to the plot. The plot was about a guy named Jeffrey \\"the dude\\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who is mistaken with another Lebowski guy who is really rich. The dude gets really peeved when some guys mistake him for the rich Lebowski and pee on his rug. So, the due is mad. The dude is into doing drugs, drinking white russians, and bowling with his pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goddman). Donny is really funny and says really random stuff. Walter is a hot temepered Vietnam vet. When the rich Lebowski's wife is kidnapped, they ask the dude to deliver the ransom. But, Walter, Donny and the dude get into a lot of a mess with the kidnappers, the cops, a porn ring and some german wackos who threathen to remove the dude's \\"johnson\\". The plot is great and there are some good funny moments. Believe me, there are some good laughs. Walter's great as is the dude. But, Jesus (John Turturro) is really weird and pointless in the movie. John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Busemi are all excellent in the movie. As is Jullianne Moore. But a lot of F words and a lot of random weird stuff make this one dissapointing. Personally, I feel that the Coen Brothers must have been on drugs while making this because it's very weird.  <br />\\"No, I'm the dude. Or his dudness o el duderino.\\" That was hilarious as was Walter's hot temper and Donny's stupidity.  <br />But, the weirdness of this movie was just too overwhelming, the conclusion was gruesome and disgusting and could have been done differently (no biting needed) and I don't know about everyone else, but I don't like hearing the F word said SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!! <br />As the 2nd Coen Brothers movie that I have seen, I strongly recommend the masterpiece that is Fargo, but not this one. Well, I'm still going to give Barton Fink and Raising Arizona a chance.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This release has really grown on me.  It wasn't something that I fell in love with on the first listen, but has been in my music rotation for some time.  I find that I enjoy the tracks more and more and look forward to hearing them.
B00006FDCD|1.0|I read probably 600 pages of the Stephen King book. The book was good and captivating but after 600 pages, he lost me. It was just way too long. And now, the movie. WOW! It's absolutely.... TERRIBLE!!! This is by far the worse movie that I have EVER seen and I wasted 3 hours of my life on it. It cuts out most of the book just to make it PG and what there is is horrid. The movie is SO BORING and the clown isn't scary at all. Whenever the clown would appear, I would fall over in laughter. The book actually gave me chills and was a freaky and scary book. This movie is anything but scary. I laughed nonstop because it was so terrible. The movie is about a group of people that regroup to kill a crazy clown that they thought that they had already killed. The movie progresses very slowly and is therefore really boring. And the clown is stupid. And not scary. So, if I were you, don't do like I did and save 3hrs of your life!
0142404071|5.0|I am not really into comics, but after picking this one up, I was impressed.  Great graphics, especially after I found out it was done by Photoshop, and an easy to understand story.  I think it was very well done and I look forward to seeing and reading more graphic novels in the future.
B000002UJQ|5.0|After an okay debut album (but still stellar effort as it was a debut, not only for the band, but also for the mini-genre they have carved out), Radiohead releases The Bends, which is a mind-bending album which many, including myself, consider a classic album. Then, they release OK Computer, and this album follows just nicely. It also provides a good transition between The Bends and Amnesiac as they blend the classic, guitar-oriented rock sound with the new-age, electronic rock sound to follow. If you are a new fan of Radiohead, welcome to their world. I would say to start with The Bends, and then buy this album. If you are a Radiohead fan and don't own this album, then you're light years behind. This album is very important to understanding the mood and feelings behind Thom Yorke's seemingly incomprehensible lyrics. The tone of the album is reminiscent of Pink Floyd (as is a lot of their stuff, though you don't have to be a fan of Floyd to appreciate this band) in that it is very moody. Yorke paints a world in which he is seemingly lost, and that is the fast-paced, dog-eat-dog world of corporate conformity. A world he so desperately wants to break free from and destroy. In some songs he feels constricted by this world. In others, he completely sattirizes that world. Overall, a great album with a powerful meaning, but certainly an album you have to be patient with to fully gain the value from. If you're just into good tunes and melodies, then only a few songs will appeal to you. If you're into artfully designed rock music, this is the perfect album (and band) for you.   Favorite song: \\"Let Down\\"
B000088E6M|1.0|who is this shorty 50 cent keeps speaking of? in my opinion 50 cent can't rap or think of a good name imma go into the same buisness and my name will be \\"dollar\\" so ill be worth more than 50 cent as a matter of fact....twice as much. so yea my album will be known as get richer than 50
B00099BPOW|3.0|This edition of Aida was formerly on 3 cd's and sold for about $50.00 dollars but now it has been put on two cd's and sells for bargain price.  There is no libretto included but there is a detailed track by track synopsis.  The booklet inside is sparse with no photos and you will only find the track details and a listing of the characters/vocalists with a final page devoted to recording information.  This production was recorded in digital stereo in the early 80's but no remastering has been done.    The sound is PRETTY GOOD with a little congestion in the louder passages and lacking somewhat in presence.  I personally didn't feel the great sense of atmosphere or splendour that i felt with the Decca Karajan version and Abbado conducts with attention to detail but could use more dramatic bite and emotional abandon in CERTAIN moments.  Abbado's conducting is not VERY passionate and is a little more on the intellectual side.  I would have found the orchestral aspect a lot more compelling and affecting if Abbado could have loosened up a bit more but he does have his moments.  Domingo is in his best voice technically and he handles the characterization of Radames passionately and effectively.  Ricciarelli is a vocalist i have always liked especially in lighter roles such as Mimi in \\"La Boheme\\" but she has moments of strain and impure tone in her performance as Aida.  It is a role that is very hard on her at times and when she has to hit those testy high notes like in \\"O patria mia\\" she sounds very strained,thinned out,and pitchy.  It's painful to hear because she handles the characterization so well with extremely eloquent phrasing giving a lot of meaning and passion to the words that she is singing.  The Mezzo Elena Obraztsova who portrays Amneris also has a voice that is challenging to the listener.  Her voice has a unpleasant thick globby sound to it and her vibrato has a wobble that at times is linked to faulty pitch especially during challenging high notes.  This gets in the way of concentrating on her characterization which she does well.  Leo Nucci plays Amonasro very effectively with a full sharp dramatic grasp on the characterization and fine powerful singing.   The rest of the cast does a fine job as well but i just felt that this Aida fell short of greatness and wasn't a compelling experience.   I base this opinion in comparrison to the Karajan/Tebaldi Decca version, The Levine Domingo Millo digital version, the Mehta Corelli EMI version, the Gigli Serafin Naxos Historical version,  and the Bjorling Perlea Rca version.  All of these are all in all better choices even though the Bjorling and Gigli versions are in mono sound but the casts are superb with the Bjorling set having a flaw in the conductor/orchestra team but they are still acceptable.  This particular Aida is a GOOD bargain and if you love the vocalists than this might be your deal but there is better.  I hope this review was helpful to you and happy opera hunting.    Oscar F.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's latest release X&Y isn't much of a departure from their two previous LP's; that said it is still very much a great album; to the fans who are expecting something epic like their first two releases might be slightly disapointed, but coldplay's music is still better than a lot of the top 40 trash that gets played on local radios      Notable tracks:  - Square One  - White Shadows  - Fix You  - X&Y (favourite!)  - A Message  - The Hardest Part  - Low
B000002GQE|5.0|1967 is a famous year in the history of popular music, but when music writers refer to the numerous classic albums that came out during those twelve months, they often forget about the most groundbreaking one of the lot - Days of Future Passed.  With this album, the Moody Blues not only successfully relaunched their flagging career, but also created what is arguably the first true concept album.  The record also brought together the rock and classical music worlds for the first time, and helped to kick-start what would become known as prog rock.    So much for the album's historical significance - the question is, does it still sound good today? The answer is an emphatic yes, thanks to the high quality of the band's music and the skilful way their songs were blended in with the orchestral interludes provided by Peter Knight and the London Festival Orchestra.  With Days of Future Passed, the Moodies hit upon the unique, lush musical style that would carry them to huge success, and some of the best examples of that style can be found on this album, which takes the form of a simple journey through one man's day.      The most outstanding songs, of course, are by lead singer/guitarist Justin Hayward.  Hayward was only 20 when this album was recorded, but with Tuesday Afternoon and the unforgettable Nights in White Satin (arguably the greatest love song ever), he announces himself as a brilliant songwriter - incredibly, he would continue composing songs of a similar standard for decades to come.  One of the band's strengths in these early days, however, was that every member contributed songs, and the others all get their chance to shine.  Keyboardist Mike Pinder provides the sublime Dawn is a Feeling, featuring a typically lovely Hayward vocal, and also the haunting Sun Set, while throughout the album he also demonstrates his mastery of the mellotron, the keyboard whose ethereal sounds would become the Moodies' trademark throughout their \\"classic 7\\" albums.  Flautist Ray Thomas also shows his somewhat underrated songwriting talent with the child-like Another Morning and the more rocking Twilight Time, which demonstrates that the Moodies were more than capable of giving their music a harder edge when they felt like it.  Bass player John Lodge also contributes, and his haunting Evening (Time to Get Away) is one of the album's highlights, although his other offering, the rocking Peak Hour, sounds a bit out of place with the other tracks.  Finally, drummer Graeme Edge commences the tradition he would maintain over the next few albums of contributing pieces of spoken poetry.  Listened to in isolation, these can sound a bit dated and cringeworthy, but when you listen to the whole album they fit in unobtrusively, providing the record with a beginning and an end.  The great thing about Days of Future Passed is that it is a complete listening experience, and the individual tracks flow almost seamlessly into each other.    In short, this album is a true classic, and one any music lover should own.  It also marked the start of a golden era for the Moodies, who would produce many more great albums over the next few years.
B000A88F22|5.0|I am very excited about this release! I'm glad that Jive decided to release it really quick.<br /><br />Here is a list of extras for the set:<br /><br />30 minutes of bonus footage,<br /><br />videos for \\"Do Somethin'\\" and \\"Someday (I Will Understand),\\"<br /><br />and a \\"making-of\\" for the \\"Someday\\" video.<br /><br />The set also comes with a bonus audio CD that will include \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\", \\"Chaotic\\", 2 new songs, and 3 bonus remixes.
B0009OPO0S|4.0|I constantly this disc in my DVD player too bad it the cd audio doesn't play back on my cd player though.   I managed to buy this when it was released and I look forward to the next one that comes out.  I love all the songs and obviously the only track I usually avoid the acoustic version of La Pared.  The Shaketon version of La Tortura is shorter but then there's two versions so I prefer the original version of course.  I enjoyed the video and the Making of documentary.  It explains a few things.  The conversation/interview was appreciated but the sound quality was a little lacking but since it has subtitles I can understand what is being said.
B000022TSY|4.0|The concept of this movie is simple! Is about this two homeless rebel riders that travel around USA to meet people and getting \\"high\\" with them.  <br /> <br />There isn't to much naughty words but the drug use is FREQUENTLY and the 60's soundtrack like hard rock and country music is also frequently. This movie can be known as a hippie movie than a motorcycle movie. <br /> <br />The bad things were: NO action, NO high speed and a uncool ending. <br /> <br />P.S: If you are a 60's fan then you should also buy Midnight Cowboy and the Woodstock concert so you can have three movies including this one that represent it's time in a very COOL way! <br /> <br />ADIOS.
B00006JU7T|5.0|first movie.  He was a stand out in that movie, I thought to myself, he's going to be a big star.  He also has the nicest head of Italian hair I've ever seen.  I don't think he's ever made a stinker of a movie.  He always puts everything into his acting and it shows every time. Serpico is no exception.  Griping and taut I enjoyed every minuite of it.  If you've never seen it please do.  You won't regret it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|that hasn't already been said. Joss Whedon is a brilliant man. Firefly has the same underlying themes as Buffy and Angel -- trust and loyalty (and the importance of communication!) -- but in a fresh and creative setting.  <br /> <br />The show got even better with each episode and the dynamic between the characters evolved into something that really came across as something special. <br /> <br />Also, notwithstanding my hopeless crush on Adam Baldwin, the entire cast is great. I can't imagine anyone more suited for each role than the actors and actresses chosen.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Turn on the radio right now and what will you hear? Enldess songs telling stories of sex, drinking, and, well, shaking your \\"thang\\". These kinds of songs were taking over the airwaves until a few months ago, a young man burst into the scene with a song called \\"I Don't Want To Be\\". <br />Yes, you know him, Gavin DeGraw. He took the music world by storm with his first single and don't think that he's just another one hit wonder. He's back with another single, \\"Chariot\\", which is doing just as well. <br />When I first heard Gavin, it was on the theme song of the hit tv show \\"One Tree Hill\\". Something about his voice and the lyrics to the song drew me in, so I went right away and got his album. Every song has its own unique sound and Gavin brings a soulful edge to each. <br />There are some upbeat songs (\\"I Dont Want To Be\\", \\"Chariot\\", \\"Chemical Party\\"), but it wouldn't be a complete album without the beautiful ballads (\\"Meaning\\", \\"More Than Anyone\\", \\"Belief\\", \\"Just Friends\\"). <br />I highly reccomend this CD for any collection. Its garaunteed to be a classic.
B000687M48|5.0|Evanescence has a beautiful voice and i think you will love her wonderful songs that is on her cd.So i suggest checking out her wonderful songs and seeing if you like her beautiful voice.
B000060P79|5.0|Well, in the couple years that Simple Plan has been on the pop/punk scene, I've seen a lot of negativity about them, and I find it annoying and rude that people say that. First and foremost, if you don't like something (i.e., Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, et cetera), then don't listen to it. It's not that hard, and it's better for the rest of us who have to read negative reviews.  <br /> <br />So I'm posting a positive a positive review of the 2002 CD \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls.\\" I got into Simple Plan the most when I heard \\"Perfect\\" on the radio. Though I recieved \\"constructive criticism\\" from my friends (the criticism was \\"What the hell is the matter with you?\\"), I liked the song a lot, namely because I could relate to the sad, realistic lyrics. Then, when I rented The New Guy, I saw the music video to \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" and loved the song--and the music video, featuring DJ Qualls and Eliza Dushku. <br /> <br />I considered buying the CD a couple of times, but it was really expensive. One thing you have to understand about me, I'm cheap. So a few months ago, my sister recieved it for Easter. I'm not sure if she likes the band or lead singer Pierre Bouvier, but I know she got the CD and I solved my money problems--I burned the CD from her. <br /> <br />What a deal! Almost every song on the CD is jam-packed full of such energy and life that it's impossible not to bust out the air-guitar and start hopping to the poppy/punk beat. <br /> <br />Such tracks I mention would be \\"I'd Do Anything\\", \\"One Day\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Grow Up.\\" My favorite songs on the CD are the usual: \\"I'm Just A Kid\\", \\"Perfect\\", \\"Addicted\\", and \\"I'd Do Anything\\" (featuring Mark Hoppus--the lower-voiced bassist--of Blink-182). I love the hidden bonus track \\"My Christmas List\\", which can be found at the end of \\"Grow Up\\" after a thirty-second period of silence. <br /> <br />There are two songs on this CD that I don't like: \\"Meet You There\\" and \\"My Alien.\\" \\"Meet You There\\" is drawn-out and boring, and I just never got into \\"My Alien\\". But that doesn't change my opinion of the quintet at all--nonetheless, they are still one of my favorite bands. <br /> <br />So, buy, burn, or steal this CD. I'm pretty sure you'll be happy with the lyrics, if you can relate to heartbreak, annoying parents, and being a teenager. <br /> <br />There are a few cons, however: Pierre's vocals can sometimes be extremely whiny and high-pitched (the same sound can be achieved by pulling hard on one's testicle), and a few of the songs start out with the same power chord. But who cares? It's good stuff. <br /> <br />Until next time.
B000002ULO|5.0|In the mid-to-late 90s, many things were happening in Paul McCartney's life. One of the most important was his involvement in the massive Beatles Anthology project, both instigated by and contributing to the resurrection of 60s and 70s nostalgia in the 1990s. Another was, his wife of almost thirty years had contracted breast cancer. Both of them knew she would not last but a couple of years. It was primarily these two influences that came together on 1997's Flaming Pie.    It's safe to say that Paul McCartney has never made a record as mature, as poignant, or as personal as Flaming Pie since leaving the Beatles. Driven both by the Anthology and (more importantly) Linda's impending death, it finds Paul at his most intimate and introspective, looking back down the years across his incredible life and career. From the title itself (a reference to John Lennon's story of the Beatles' \\"origin\\") and waltzing nostalgia of the very first track (The Song We Were Singing), this record is a celebration of Paul's past. This imbues upbeat songs like Calico Skies and Young Boy with a rainy-day melancholy, and the plaintive ballads (quite possibly Paul's finest) with a sense of inextinguishable hope and rebirth. Two of the latter, Somedays and Little Willow, heartbreaking tributes to Linda in retrospect, stand head and shoulders above almost anything McCartney has ever done - including the Beatles.    Also, Flaming Pie finds Paul combining his personal troubles with his penchant for beneficial collaboration. More than half the album is co-produced and supported by the phenomenal Mr. Jeff Lynne, mastermind behind ELO and producer for the likes of Tom Petty and George Harrison. Longtime friends Ringo Starr and Steve Miller also make appearances (as does Paul's son James on guitar), and Sir George Martin lends his genius to a few songs, making Flaming Pie one of his final projects. And even if a few duds managed to slip through the cracks (the bluesy jams Used to Be Bad and Really Love You with Steve and Ringo/Jeff, respectively), for the most part it's solid, twenty-four-carat gold as only Paul McCartney can mine it.    Flaming Pie closes on two seemingly disparate but perfectly complimentary songs: Beautiful Night and Great Day. The former is an orchestral epic ala Abbey Road, a grand culmination of all Flaming Pie's ingredients; the latter a simple, touching folk song from the days of the original McCartney album in 1970, a last loving duet between Paul and Linda. And that sums it up nicely, I believe. Only Band on the Run can topple it.
0736697659|4.0|Kate Reading does an excellent job narrating this tale.  She puts a lot of emotion into her portrayal of Emma and also does a great job at giving different voices to the other characters. I find sometimes that audiobooks can put me to sleep because the narrators drone on in monotone voices, but that is not the case here!
B0006L16N8|4.0|Four stars...  When I thought about writing this belated review, I was thinking more along the lines of three stars, because a middle of the road rating shows my ambivalent feelings toward Coldplay's \\"X & Y\\" released this summer.  Do Ithink it's a masterpiece?  No, I don't.  Do I think it's a let down?  Absolutely not.  So what is it about this album?  Is it special? <br /> <br />First let me say that I'm happy with the direction the band is taking.  They are their own band and have been from the beginning despite Radiohead-lite allegations.  (Note: does anyone think this band is really as idiosyncratic as Radiohead?)  Obviously, their inspiration starts and ends with U2, or at least it sounds that way.  And with this album, they take it one step further and do an all ballad album, like a space rock LP of variations of \\"A Sort of Homecoming.\\"  I'm glad mostly because it will upset music critics.  Pitchfork gave it a low rating, stating it was \\"inoffensive.\\"  Shows what they're after...  Music isn't good unless it's offensive, bleak, and difficult to digest... (why do we listen to these critics?)  That's precisely what I like about this album and the people who will buy it; they don't listen to these pretentious plebians who consider themselves our \\"intellectual superiors.\\"  Oh well. <br /> <br />The album feels like it wwants to be a step forward from the classic \\"Rush of Blood,\\" but it only feels that way.  The atmosphere of the entire album is very clean, air-y, sonic, produced...  The songs themselves sound like a retreat from their past, superior material.  But even though the first two albums might be slightly better for varying reasons, this is the album I'd rather listen to.  The songs may be infinitely calculated, but there's nothing wrong with maturity or lovesongs, made evident by \\"Fix You,\\" \\"Talk,\\" and the Clocks-rip \\"Speed of Sound.\\"  A great album. <br /> <br />Rating:  8 out of 10.
0385336810|4.0|I enjoyed this story a lot, but I have to say it reminded me a lot of Bridget Jones' Diary.  Emma and Bridget have similar personality traits such as their propensity to botch things up...especially their jobs and their romantic relationships.  If you liked Bridget Jones' Diary, you should equally enjoy this book.
B00005IC2H|3.0|People either seem to feel that this is a life defining record or \\"pretentious\\" bilge. It's neither. It should be accepted for what it is: interesting music that is original in its context. I believe that Agaetis Byrjun is a record that is best listened to while in a meloncholly or nostalgic state. Essentially, it has a purpose and it serves it well. I only give it three stars due to its limited applications, or rather, I doubt you would want to listen to this record at absolutely any given time. For me, a five star record is a record that will enhance my emotions, regardless of what they are.
0060987464|5.0|This book shows Marilyn Manson's metamorphosis from Brian Warner (such like any other kid) to Marilyn Manson. This is my favorite book, when it comes to Marilyn Manson. If you don't know anything about him or have been brain-washed by the the lies, you should read it. I am a Marilyn Manson fan, I am not saying that it is a great book because I just want you to buy it and give him more money. I want you to buy it because you will understand what he really is and what he really stands for. Which I also misunderstood, but this book helped me understand him and his music. And made me appreciate it as many people can't.  <br /> <br />  This is one of those \\"weird\\" books which you cannot stop reading until you finish it. Even if you are not a Marilyn Manson fan or maybe you one of those \\"Anti-Manson\\", After you finish reading it, I can guarantee that maybe you will not become a fan of his, but at least you will learn how to respect him. And if you are going to judge him (in a negative way), at least you will have the power to judge him for the right reasons, for the things he REALLY did, based on the truth. Not the rumors. After reading it, Marilyn Manson has become an obsession for me, and my idol, my teacher and a philosopher in my mind, He really changed me to a positive way.
B0001HAISG|5.0|When I was a boy I rented out the Walt Disney version of Peter Pan from the library and loved it so much I went out a rented the Kathy Rigby version anbd the Mary Martin version and then got all excited when Peter Pan Return To Neverland came out. Then around Christmas 2003 a new Peter Pan version came out and when it came to dvd in 2004 I got excited. But first I watched it on tv and loved it so I went to best buy with my dad and with my own money bought a copy of the BEST PETER PAN MOVIE MADE!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I AM A HUGE GREEN DAY FAN, When this new album came out, I went out and got it, when I pop it in the cd player, I was shocked, Was this Green Day. I was happy to see a new change in the music style, I was blown away and the songs were great and made me reflect on things for some odd reason. But my favorite song is Jesus of Suburbia; its a great song about a guy on a discovery on what he believes in, I higly recommend this to anyone who likes rock, if your a Green Day fan, do I even need to tell you. GO OUT AND GET THIS!!!!
0743454529|5.0|The minute I read the 1st page I was intrigued.  I read the entire book in 2 days and took it with me everywhere.  I was driving my family crazy.  The story is so real and will touch your life in some way, either you have a daughter, son, husband or death had invaded your life.  I was sobbing at the end of it....I have passed it to my friend who passed it to her 14 yr old daughter.....
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I don't know if Iron Maiden will ever top the heights they reached back in the '80s.  They came close with Brave New World, but this disc misses the mark somewhat. <br /> <br />First off, this disc is really long.  It's eleven tracks that run about 75 minutes, and given how it reached that length, I'd say it's about twenty minutes too long.  A few of the songs seem to have the choruses repeated ad infinitum just so they can top the 7-minute mark.  And the production is terrible; the guitars are much too heavy on midrange, Steve Harris is practically buried under all those guitars, and in general the mix sounds overcompressed. <br /> <br />But when they're on, they're really on.  The title track in particular stands out, especially the middle section.  \\"Wildest Dreams\\" and \\"Rainmaker\\" show that Maiden can do catchy, singable stuff when they want to.  \\"Paschendale\\" conjures up some very un-glorious images of trench warfare, although the music never quite takes off. <br /> <br />Hopefully with the next studio release, Maiden will trim off some of the fat and clean up the sound.  If you're a diehard fan, go ahead and buy it; otherwise I can't really recommend this one.
B0002858YS|3.0|Ok, Ok, the only song i like is Mr. Brightside. It is an awesome song. Check out the video.  <br /> <br />Last Word: <br />*none*
B000063DI9|5.0|While I don't think this is the best Iron Maiden album ever, it is definitely one of their best, and it was their last good one for many, many years.  It's also the only real \\"concept\\" album they ever did.  But you can easily ignore the concept; this is a really good listen, and all the song stand on their own.  And while the Irons had always had prog-rock tendencies, and even started indulging them a bit more on Powerslave, they really go over to the dark side on this one.  There's plenty of the trademark galloping guitars, but also a lot of guitar synth (and about half of those parts probably would have worked as just plain old guitar). <br /> <br />While all the songs on this disc are good, my personal faves are the title track, \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" and \\"The Clairvoyant.\\" <br /> <br />I wouldn't start here, but if you've gotten a taste for Iron Maiden, you need this album.
B0000AM6LY|4.0|I like this CD, it sounds a little retro in some places and takes me back.. MH has wonderful talent, his voice still sounds terrific even after all these years. Take a try and enjoy this CD, it's hip, cool, and fun all at the same time. Groovy baby...
B00005JL2O|5.0|I saw this in the theatre on opening day. Yet I din't understand it as much as i understood he first 2, but then again, I enjoyed it. Then i got it for Xmas the same year and I just watched it a couple days ago. This, I think, is the best outta all of them.<br /><br />STORY: In 2002, Austin is still shagadelic. He one time stops Dr. Evil's plan he had and is knighted by the queen of England... only to find his dad did not attend. Dissapointed by his fazha's(as GM says)failure to attend, He then stops by Dr. Evil's prison and is informed to go back to 1975 and rescue him. but then, a Dutch henchman named Goldmember kidnaps him, takes him back to 2002, and then Austin, and a chick named Foxxy Cleopatra meanwhile Dr. Evil escapes with Mini Me from prison, and start fresh on a sub going into Japan.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: Awesome! I liked how Fat Bastard has T**ts in this one. And HARD KNOCK LIFE from \\"Annie\\", thats hilarious!<br /><br />You should own all AP movies! Especially this!
B0002858YS|2.0|First off, I want to ask why everybody is trying so hard to defend this band from people that dislike the album. You are not body guards and if your 'favorite band' is insulted, who cares? Stop defending them. We want reviews, not hour long speeches about how The Killers are not copying 80s music.  <br /> <br />Anyways, where do I begin? <br />Like almost anybody else, I heard Somebody Told Me on the radio and thought, hey this catchy. After about 3 months of that song essentially played on repeat over the air, it got boring, and they introduced Mr. Brightside. Now, being in Junior High, everybody was buzzing around my head screaming \\"OMG!!! Mr. Brightside! lolzZZZzzz that song is s0000 true. It c0mpl3tely parallels mai life!!!!!!11\\" Maybe that's honestly the reason I hated the song, but something about the primitive lyrics and angsty music just didn't add up. It's as if their manager told them to make something depressing, and they tried as hard as they could, put a bunch of their failed attempts together, and called it a hit. After another few months of constant nagging from friends, I found the album online and listened to it. Not only are all the songs at Mr. Brightside's standard or worse, they also sound so the same with repeated guitar patterns and drums, that you can't tell when one song ends and another begins. So much like my previous sentence, this album seems to run on far past what it should. The only reason I'm giving this album 2 stars is because of Somebody Told Me, which managed to be a good song despite it's terrible lyrics. (Somebody told me, you had a boyfriend, that looked like a girlfriend, that I had in February of last year...)

B0007ZEBIK|2.0|In case you were thinking, I'm being sarcastic.  This is the top of being emo, these guys do not rock and they are more pop than punk, and their song and lyrics are \\"what\\" and \\"huh?\\".
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for Britney to top her last album (2001's \\"Britney\\"), but she was damn close to doing it with \\"In The Zone.\\" It's a step in a new direction for Britney, with songs about self-indulgence, betraying a significant other, and much more.   <br /> <br />Britney's musical talent has been a source of debate for years, basically since she hit the scene with her debut album, 1999's \\"...Baby One More Time.\\" While she doesn't have the vocal chops of Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, or even Jessica Simpson, she CAN sing and she does it well. There's no denying that the girl has skills. I truly believe that she IS a gifted singer and musician, even though there are thousands of detractors out there who think otherwise. If you'd actually listen to this album (or any of her previous records) with an open mind, you'd see that I'm right. <br /> <br />Like I mentioned before, the songs on \\"In The Zone\\" are much different compared to Britney's past material. She dabbles in different musical stylings, but still manages to remain true to her pop roots. I, for one, am looking forward to Britney's follow-up album, to see where she decides to take her music next. <br /> <br />1. \\"ME AGAINST THE MUSIC\\" (featuring Madonna): 5/5 <br />2. \\"(I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM\\" (featuring the Ying-Yang Twins): 5/5 <br />3. \\"SHOWDOWN\\": 5/5 <br />4. \\"BREATHE ON ME\\": 5/5 <br />5. \\"EARLY MORNIN'\\": 4/5 <br />6. \\"TOXIC\\": 5/5 <br />7. \\"OUTRAGEOUS\\": 4/5 <br />8. \\"TOUCH OF MY HAND\\": 5/5 <br />9. \\"THE HOOK-UP\\": 5/5 <br />10. \\"SHADOW\\": 5/5 <br />11. \\"BRAVE NEW GIRL\\": 4/5 <br />12. \\"EVERYTIME\\": 5/5 <br />13. \\"ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix)\\": 4/5 <br /> <br />Please give this an album a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised, even if you aren't a Britney fan.
B0007O38F8|1.0|What is going on with the reference to candy and teddy bear and cuddly things?  And he supposed to be a rapper!  Why do people buy this kind of music, if you call it music at all.  Just put a couple of synthesizer bars together along with a beat a walla, you have a song.  Yo GEE-DAWG this album is too much club music and the lyrics are \\"WHACK\\", \\"lick you like a lollipop\\"?
B00004SCX6|5.0|You may love Britney Spears, or you may loathe her. Either way, you can't deny that the girl knows how to put an album together - insanely catchy songs, one after the other.  The title track, \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" is THE definative pop song: Britney wraps her coy, seductive voice around a great beat and a mind-numbingly addictive chorus.  Sure, the lyrics may be a bit silly, but that doesn't matter.  <br /> <br />Britney's vocal talent has been a huge source of debate since she broke onto the scene with her debut album, and I'm here to tell you that she CAN sing. She may not have the chops of Christina Aguilera or Kelly Clarkson, but she does what she can and she does it extremely well.  <br /> <br />1. \\"OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN\\": 5/5 <br />2. \\"STRONGER\\": 5/5 <br />3. \\"DON'T GO KNOCKIN' ON MY DOOR\\": 5/5 <br />4. \\"(I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION\\": 4/5 <br />5. \\"DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW\\": 5/5 <br />6. \\"WHAT U SEE (IS WHAT U GET)\\": 5/5 <br />7. \\"LUCKY\\": 5/5 <br />8. \\"ONE KISS FROM YOU\\": 5/5 <br />9. \\"WHERE ARE YOU NOW\\": 5/5 <br />10. \\"CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME\\": 5/5 <br />11. \\"WHEN YOUR EYES SAY IT\\": 4/5 <br />12. \\"DEAR DIARY\\": 4/5 <br /> <br />Give this album a shot and you'll be glad you did!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|After watching the entire dvd set I realized, this series is so similar to Andromeda.  They have the captain, mechanic, driver, tough guy, and the odd girl out.  It gave off the same vibe.  That's why I like it.  It is not the best show I've ever seen.  I like Smallville better.  I would put it in the same league as Stargate SG-1 and early seasons of Andromeda. <br /> <br />Of the 4 dvd's included.  The 2nd dvd is by far the weakest of the episodes.  The show starts off great with the first dvd... but then I was like is this all there is.  But good thing the 3rd dvd is really good.  More interesting plots. <br /> <br />Despite the kinda lackluster special effects and sometimes stalling action.  It is worth it to get this dvd set.  The characters are great and the dialogue is really good.  They say the right things at the right time. <br /> <br />After watching the dvd set, I am more excited to see the movie.
B00005OM4N|5.0|It can't be disputed that Britney Spears is largely responsible for the explosion of teen pop music in the late '90s, but with \\"Britney,\\" she rises head and shoulders above her competitors (Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, etc.).  I've always thought that she's in a league of her own, and this album just confirms that.... <br /> <br />1. \\"I'M A SLAVE 4 U\\" - 5/5 <br />2. \\"OVERPROTECTED\\" - 5/5 <br />3. \\"LONELY\\" - 5/5 <br />4. \\"I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN\\" - 5/5   <br />5. \\"BOYS\\" - 5/5 <br />6. \\"ANTICIPATING\\" - 5/5 <br />7. \\"I LOCK ROCK & ROLL\\" - 5/5 <br />8. \\"CINDERELLA\\" - 5/5 <br />9. \\"LET ME BE\\" - 4/5 <br />10. \\"BOMBASTIC LOVE\\" - 4/5 <br />11. \\"THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME\\" - 5/5 <br />12. \\"WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME\\" - 5/5 <br /> <br />I strongly recommend that you buy this album and listen to it, even if you aren't a Britney fan - you'll be VERY pleasantly surprised. Britney's voice is in fine form throughout every song, and even though she may not have the vocal chops of Christina Aguilera or Kelly Clarkson, she does what she can and delivers.  Don't listen to the many haters out there - give the album a chance and you'll be glad you did!
B00006FDCD|2.0|When I first saw this movie on TV many years ago I liked it. I thought it was a good representation of how things are so magical and scary when you are a kid. However I hadnt read the book before I saw it. I recently read the book and saw the this movie again as was suprised at how much it sucked in comparison. I loved the book and as I read it I kept saying, \\"Why wasnt that in the movie\\". Bottom line is that they cut out the majority of the book just to make it marketable to television audiences. That was a mistake. If any book was made to be brought to the big screen it was IT. Come on, the movie weakened one of Stephen Kings strenghts which is his character development. It even made the bond that they each had as children seem so random and weak that it was no wonder that they didnt remember each other when they grew up. When you read the book you wonder, \\"How could they forget\\". My advice is to read the book and wait for Stephen King to write the screenplay for this to become a real movie.
B00005JL78|1.0|This \\"film\\" is the worst movie i have ever seen. Well, we all have seen some real stinkers, though. THis one is very high on the stinker list. It is right there along with Wild Wild West, War of the worlds, Day after tomorrow, and Independence Day.  bad acting, bad plot, totally boring. Non-eventful and totally implausible.  Last I saw the white house was still standing; unfortunately, it has some boob running it with his henchmen. THe U.S. may has well as invaded costa rica instead of Iraq.  There was no reason to at all.  They put fear in the populace and all of the sheep ate it up like hog-slop and rewarded him with another term. Absolutely disgraceful. I am embarrassed to be a US citizen.  <br /> <br />Back to the movie;  this film is terrible. Don't waste your time.  IT is a poorly written script, bad story, and bad acting.  Tom Cruise should learn his lesson from working with spielberg and not make another stinker with him. He will be hard pressed to ever top his work with Oliver Stone. Tom is capable of so much better. SO is colin farrell.
1563894696|4.0|Batman: The Long Halloween is one of my favorite Batman Trade Paper backs, and one of the first I picked up.  In this book, all of the best Batman foes make an appreance, along with the Falcone crime family, unseen since Year One.  On top of that, the origin of Two-Face is rewritten in spectacular stlye.  While reading this novel, its imperative that the events are taking place some time after Year One, but while Batman is still learning the ropes.  Therefore, some readers will be put off by the \\"amaturish\\" way Batman conducts himself, but then, the fact that he is still learning the ropes makes the story all the more gripping.
B00005JKCH|4.0|When I first saw this film over 3 years ago, I was one of the very few people to not enjoy the film. It hardly seemed anything special to me at the time, and it's gigantic success was, in all honestly, quite baffling. Needless to say, I gave a less than glowing review of Spider-Man 1. But now, after years removed from it's opening, and as my knowledge of the comic books this movie was based on grows, I find myself liking this movie more and more. And thusly, feel the need to retract my previous statements about it, and submit a new review of the film.    I guess, my main problem with Spider-Man (AKA SM1) originally was it's lack of sophistication and depth. The somewhat hollow, campy, \\"popcorn flick\\" nature of the movie didn't sit well with me...I didn't understand it. Now however, after viewing it multiple times, I've begun to understand the director's goal in regards to SM1, and, really, its beauty. Spider-Man is not a deep, emotional movie like Batman Begins or even its sequel, Spider-Man 2, would be. It trades in emotion for fun. And it succeeds excellently.    Of course, at the beginning of the film, we open with young Peter Parker. A geek, hopelessly in love with a girl whom won't even give him the time of day. The real beauty of this origin really can't be observed without a knowledge of the source material. But once you are familiar with said material, it's quite astonishing. Amazingly, the first 30 minutes of Spider-Man are a near duplication of Amazing Fantasy #15 (Spider-Man's introductory issue). There are some changes to be sure. Such as Mary Jane's role in it all (in the comics, she doesn't appear until much later), and certainly plot lines that would have just been too campy for a big blockbuster of 2002. That aside, SM1 does an amazing job of bring Spider-Man's original, comic book origin to the screen. As good as, if not more so, than any other comic book adaptation yet made.    The acting, one of the main sticking points of my original review, is still not all I would like it to be. While Maguire delivers a strong performance as our hero, he doesn't quite inhabit the character like other actors have in the past and present. But he definitely does a good job, and while its not the best performance of his career (Seabiscuit receives that honor), he does give an admirable effort that leaves little room for complaints. Willam Dafoe also gives a stand-out performance as one of Spider-Man's deadliest villains, The Green Goblin. Dafoe injects his usual creepy demeanor into the character, and while, like Maguire, it isn't the best performance of his career, it is noticeable and memorable. I've also come to appreciate acting of both Rosemary Harris as the caring Aunt May and the campy brilliance of J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson. Sadly however, the real weak link in the cast would have to be Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. I've always thought Dunst was a fairly capable child-actor, but as an adult she seems to have actually lost talent, as her performance in SM1 seems sadly hollow, adding nothing to the character, and hardly bringing it to life at all. Though I will admit, her character is written as poorly as it is acted. The director's GweMJ concept (the fusing of Peter's two comic love interests Gwen Stacy and MJ), is quite flawed, and seems to diminish MJ's character rather than add to it.    One of my biggest problems of the film would have to be the score. Despite being a big fan of Danny Elfman, I was overwhelmingly disappointed with his score for SM1.  It seems to lack any and all distinctiveness, which a theme that sounds more like Batman-lite than Spider-Man, and a overall collection of notes that entirely unimpressive, and easily forgettable.    Though may complain about SM1's special effects and poor CGI, I didn't find them particularly troublesome. While they aren't the best effects in the world by any means, they're acceptable, and overall, the actions are quite well done. Probably the best actions scenes in a superhero movie up until that point, in fact.    Probably the aspect of the movie, is also the worst. The camp factor. While, positively, this makes the film extremely fun and easy to watch and rewatch, it also kills any and all possibility of it every being a \\"great\\" film, an epic film. This could turn some away (as it did me), but, thankfully, two years later, this \\"flaw\\" was greatly rectified greatly in Spider-Man 2. SM2 almost makes SM1 an introduction rather than an individual film, and this, in turn, makes SM1 a better movie in its own right. The lack of seriousness and drama is now understood, and even welcome, as it's all being saved up for Act #2 (and maybe even #3) in Spider-Man's multi-film saga.    All in all, my opinion of Spider-Man 1 has changed quite drastically over the past few years, and frankly, I'm glad it did, as Spider-Man is indeed a wonderful popcorn flick that nearly everyone can enjoy.    8/10
0385512058|5.0|Keith Ferrazzi provides a clear framework on how success, in any business, is achieved through carefully developed relationships with others who can help us achieve our individual goals. He more importantly reminds us of how we can be of service to others. Be certain not to overlook this point.  How often is it that we read a business book that speaks on how we can help others?  Unfortunately, the answer to that question is \\"not often enough.\\" I can speak from personal experience at major corporations that education and experience are only a small piece of the success puzzle. All of the college degrees in the world will not equal the power of having your name tossed around by Directors, Executive Directors or VPs when another top-level manager asks if they \\"know somebody\\" that can fill a particular position. I recommend this book to anyone who is serious about achieving the impossible. You may be able to do it alone; but why would you?
B0000931QR|5.0|It's been a while since I popped in a CD that went straight to headphones. I'm not a guy who dances to music. While a whole crowd may get crazy, for some reason I stand in the background absorbing every sound and intricacy. If there's talent, I'll notice. I discovered music late at the age of 17. The first music I liked I loved, and I always listened to it through headphones, appreciating every sound- sometimes quite loudly. Yet, it has been years since I last heard music that is precisely to my taste. The headphones weren't getting much use, and my music mostly blared loudly through a stereo (though I still would just stand back and audio-observe). I sampled this CD before I bought it, and I had a hunch that its impact would remind me of before. The CD went straight into my personal CD player, and I knew I was right. This is rock music from Spain. Well, it's referred to as pop, but I'll call it rock since it's acoustic. I love it when bands play pop-type songs with rock instruments! That shows how talented they are. They wield the instruments so well that there is no limit to their creations. It isn't three-chord blandness. For some reason, though, the music has made me talk in my sleep a lot. Spanish from Spain sounds a little different from Spanish spoken from other countries, and I guess its relation to English creates a subliminal, subconscious pondering over it- in the form of sleep talk. Anyway, my very favorite track is \\"Rosas.\\" Listen to it before watching the vid. A music video can't possibly do a song justice that is this well-written. The music video isn't bad, but the song by itself is one of the most amazing melodies I've ever heard. The support vocals are just amazing. Song 5, if taken originally, has a punch and might that makes it more than just a dance-type song. If you hear what I hear, it'll sound more like, shall I say, \\"inspiring...\\" I usually backtrack and buy previous albums of a new band I discover, but this album is hard to match. Of course, since progress is the epitome of good music, that is a very good sign.
B000A59PMO|5.0|this is the best show i have seen in a long time. it has so many plot twists and unexpected turns. it's about a resourceful girl who's father is a p.i. and she helps solve cases at her school, all the while trying to find out who murdered her best friend lily kane. it's a great show with just a little bit of drama, has comedy and mystery.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Halle Berry should have won and an academy award for this one.   Her acting talents really show through in this film.  Not only is she a very talented and smart actress in my book but also have you ever noticed no matter how messed up her hair is or how dirty she looks in any of her films she still has that natural beauty (even without makeup) that offsets all the dirt and other garbage that Hollywood tries to use.  What a flawless face.  Anyway , she portrays a psychiatrist/doctor in the film who treats a specific patient (Penelope Cruz)for mental disturbance who is possesssed by a ghost entitie which eventually she (Halle Berry) will encounter later in the movie.  The twist/plot shift in this movie IS GREAT.  I never would have guessed.  She has a car accident and is accused of killing her husband.  Thats all I am saying.  I don't want to go into the specifics of this film because that would ruin it for someone who has never seen it.  All I can say is that this is the type of movie that I could watch time and time again.  I do not see how someone could rate this film a one or two star film.  This DVD will have a place on my shelf after I go out and buy it.   I LOVED THIS MOVIE.
B0000074NU|3.0|<br /> The song selection here is okay, but it would be a wiser idea to purchase \\"Essential UFO\\" (and Essential MSG for that matter) <br />as those are the most complete \\"Best Of\\" packages available for those two great bands. Avoid all the other slapped together discs that are merely trying to sucker you in.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Have you heard Appetite for Destruction yet? This goes great with <br />it. Now, first of all, I'd rather have 13 or 14 good songs than <br />12 or 16 bad songs from all the other GNR albums. That means, in <br />my opinion, this is GNR's only good CD followed up. It is ranked <br />the best heavy metal CD yet and has a much better quality sound <br />than most of those heavy metal bands' compilations. On this CD, <br />there is only 2 songs missing, It's So Easy, and Mr. Brownstone. <br />Everything with the exception of Sympathy for the Devil, and Ain't it Fun, is great!! Probably those are the only 2 you need <br />to take out. November Rain, Sweet Child, Paradise City, & Civil <br />War would be my favorites on the whole compilation. Buy the whole <br />collection because this is never a waste of money, it is worth it <br />to buy this.
630562285X|4.0|I admit the first time I saw this I wasn't impressed, but I just saw it again a few nights ago and really enjoyed it. I have always admired Sean's skill and presence...What's interesting and a little  iffy is that he plays a \\"likeable bad guy\\". His appeal is present in force but I think they could have casted the female lead much better, Jones is no where near the caliber Sean is. I don't like the Bond films...even the ones with Sean, because they are SO predictable and flimsy. Now, usually I like a story with depth and backstory which this one simply doesn't have. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable all the same.  <br /> <br />I admire that there is no sex scene (I plain don't like them; but that's not to say that Sean has lost his sex appeal, he hasn't! And please give the guy a break about his age and the fact that he's slowin' down a bit...I think anyone of his age would.) <br /> <br />Overall he's still got it. *A 22-year-old Sean fan*
B00000DGUY|4.0|I hated it when they had to edit Money for Nothing, isn't it aweful? True, they had to edit the album in order to put all the <br />songs on 1 audio CD. These single edits are terrible. They edited <br />songs such as Private Investigations, So Far Away, Money for Nothing, Brothers in Arms, Calling Elvis, & On Every Street. But <br />those are still all one of my favorites too. I really liked the <br />end riff closer on Money for Nothing so if you need to, buy the <br />Brothers In Arms CD for full length versions of these songs that <br />were edited. Other than that, this is still a great CD but is missing to many songs. Down to the Waterline, Six Blade Knife, <br />Lions, Where Do You Think You're Going, Skateaway, Expresso Love, <br />Hand in Hand, Solid Rock, Les Boys, Telegraph Road, Industrial <br />Disease, Love over Gold studio, It Never Rains, When It Comes to <br />You, Fade to Black, Bug, You and Your Friend, My Parties, and <br />Planet of New Orleans, all those songs are missing. Probably if <br />you are new to Dire Straits, start out with Dire Straits 1978, and then all the other studio albums by them. Skip this and go <br />with some of those albums. You will be glad you did. Anyway, the <br />best songs would be Tunnel of Love, and Heavy Fuel which those <br />are my favorites. I'll rate this CD 4.5 stars because this album <br />had to many single edits.
B000000JO3|1.0|Basically if you're a fugazi nut stay away. <br />If you like music stay away. <br />If you're anti MTV but perversely buy music on Amazon - buy it. <br /> <br />I could do this type of tosh if I had my eyes shut. Well, maybe. <br /> <br />Oh, and you straight edgers - chill out a bit. <br /> <br />I wonder why it has to get a star at all?
B00000IQCZ|5.0|Take a trip back in time to St. Louis in 1903. Enjoy the funfilled life of the Smith family. This movie has it all. Breathtaking scenery, humor, wonderful singing and dancing make this movie a family favorite. You will want to see it again and again. Good clean entertainment for all ages.
1577314808|1.0|I really dont think this book is all it is cracked up to be. It just seems too repetitive and never really gets down the whole point in a way that is understandable for most humans. I am in a class right now and we are using this book for a guide, and I will say that everyone in the class would probably agree with me. There is too much fluffy info and it lacks a tride and true method of some sort. When I read this book, I feel like I am starring into a deep space hole or something. I am all about the power of the so called now...but this book sucks... I would suggest reading something by Lama Surya Das if you are interested in this sort of thing... at least his books are interesting and they dont repeat the same things over and over in the most ambigous way... <br />
B000002ILG|5.0|I like this cd, the hardness of the rock really comes out. Vitto Bratta uses the similar guitar style as Eddie Van Halen. My friend's dad graduated with Vitto. He said: \\"he was an overall great guy, and he loved playing his guitar\\". His guitar is excellent, and HIS IS A GOOD GUITARIST. Go for it. \\"Wait\\" is a great hardrock track, that shows you he's an \\"Eddie Van Halen\\" guitarist. WOW.    Here are a few of my fav hair bands:  Poison  Winger  Skid Row  Van Halen  AC/DC  White Lion  Def Leppard  Motley Crue  Whitesnake  Poison    As you can see, these are bands that are similar to White Lion. If I forgot any bands, just add them. I basically like all of those hair metal bands. They all had a few hits. Van Halen and AC/DC were not really big hair metal bands. Van Halen had alot of those hair metal type songs. If you like those bands, you will mos def like White Lion. Go for it.
0743454529|5.0|I just finished this book today.  I must say that I really enjoyed this novel.  I'm almost sorry that I'm finished the book already.  The characters really will stay with me for a long time.  And though I admit that Sara's character made me angry at times, as a mother myself, I can also relate to her.  I read some of the reviews and saw that alot of people complain about the ending.  I disagree, I think it was a perfect ending.  Sad...but it fit the flow of the book.  And if you really think about it, any other ending would have been pretty lame, or not given closure.  And really, what is the point of reading a book if it is exactly what you expect.  I commend the author for writing characters that are very real, and even portraying life as it really is...with unexpected turns.  <br />                                    -Robin 23 Pensylvania

0780626966|5.0|If you love the \\"A nightmare on Elm Street\\" movies, this is for you. EVen if one or two aren't that great, this boxset is way easier than buying the four or five dvd's you love. I mean, 7 movies , a bonus 8th disk and a booklet descussing all 7 movies for only 80 dollars is a very good price.So, instead of looking at the two or three small things it doesn't come with, you're better off looking at the positive of it. However, if you only like maybe one or two of the films, you're better off buying just those dvds. THis is only for fans whom enjoy the majoroty of the series films. ( if you don't, lets face it you're simply wasting your hard earned money) Now, for those of you who haven't seen these films I will give a short run down of them ( with NO spoilers)<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street part 1 - Classic film and the best of the series, Freddy is probably the most frightening in this one, a cult classic. Even if you hate the rest, i'm sure you will love this one. It starts out as a young teen girl's (Heather Langenkamp) friends start dying in their sleep by you guessed it Freddy Krueger, as the movie goes on you learn a little about Freddy's history and how he came to be,Johnny Depp's movie debut. I give this 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2. How do you follow up a great movie like the first? Well, eh. They really didn't, one of the worst installments in the series right after the best (go figure)<br /><br />A young man moves into the same house as the girl from the first movie (Heather Langenkamp) and Freddy uses his body to come back, this movie suffers from havin a poor leading man and a leading woman that is too ditzy, however Robert England doesn't dissapointed and is as scary as the first, making this atleast watchable. I give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street part 3 This right here, should have been part two, bring's back Heather Langenkamp's character and her father, this time she finds some teenagers in a mental institution, who have been having some pretty bad dreams..... this movie has strong acting by every character (even the ones who don't stay very long) here Freddy gets a bit of humour, while staying scary though ( the humour isn't over done like in future movies) I give this 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 4. sees the return of the surviving members of part 3, however, if you loved, part 3 the first 20 minutes or so might be a little vexing to you.Features a new hero (lisa) and her often dim witted yet charismatic boyfriend. This movie isn't great but definetly good has good actors and a few bad ones, Freddy is still Freddy and this is one of the better sequals. I give this 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street part 5 Sees the return of Lisa. The story is Freddy comes back and is turning her unborn baby into a prodidgy of himself. The plot is one of the best, just not acted out very well. Freddy gets a little too funny. Yet is full of likable heros. Also goes deeper in Freddy's history While it isn't the best it is far from the worst and one of the most under rated in the series. I give this 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />A Nightmare on ELm street part 6. One of the worst, plot is not thought out well and freddy goes over the edge with humor, few people die and the deaths take way too long. However, you learn the most about Freddy in this movie and that is the main reason to watch it. The plot is, that there is only one more kid left on Elm Street (our old pal Freddy did away with the rest) however the final kid has a bad case of amnesia and can't recall anything. Features scenes with a pre-teen human Freddy and a teenage human version of him, with a guest appearence by Alice Cooper as Freddy's drunk abusive father. (maybe somebody should have told poor old Freddy just because you were abused, you shouldn't abuse others) I give this one 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Wes Craven's New Nightmare The biggest turn in the series, Freddy gets an upgrade and for the first time, is in the real world. With this plot, the \\"A nightmare on Elm Street\\" films are just that films. Heather Langenkamp stars as herself and Wes Craven is in it as just Wes Craven, however when Heather's son starts believing in him, he comes to life, when Wes finds this out he flees. ( I would have loved to have seen a Wes fighting Freddy scene.) A new twist is just what the series needed after part 6 but i'm glad Freddy went back to the world of fiction in \\"Freddy vs Jason\\" good film. I give this 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />So in conclusion if you love the \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" series Buy this now. Enjoyr /> <br />Wes Craven's New Nightmare The biggest turn in the series, Freddy gets an upgrade and for the first time, is in the real world.

B000A88F22|5.0|This DVD is from the show that ran on UPN, MTV, and VH1.  It's a lovely little slice of Britney's life before during and after she met her husband, Kevin.  It's amazingly honest in discussions about wanting to be loved and cared for, sex, marriage customs, and life in general.  One sees Britney in wonderful playful moments, dancing and being goofy for Kevin.  Also, there are some sad, pensive times during the early stages of courtship.  The wedding itself, I felt was the best part.  They pulled of a complete surprise for the entire family, and they were a couple of kids, being so pleased about it.  The wedding itself was incredibly beautiful.  At the end we see a sincere, heartfelt tribute to Britney from Kevin that will make your eyes tear up.  He also makes a little video of a joyous Britney spontaneously dancing for him.  The Video is just beautiful.  A celebration of pregnancy and motherhood as seen through a young, first time mother's eyes.  And Britney's lyrics and melody ring lovely and true.  I'm looking forward to the release of Britney's two new songs in this package: Chaotic and Someday (I Will Understand), in addition to The Making of the Video for Someday.

B000055Y0X|5.0|This film is my favorite with Peter Sellers in it, in most other of his movies, he is an annoying personality. But in this Kubrick masterpiece, he shines as Merkin Muffley, the U.S. president; Captian Lionel Mandrake of the RAF; and the ex-nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove. This movie is so funny, that when Dr. Strangelove was trying to controll his rebellious right arm and stop it from heiling Hitler, even the Russian ambassador couldn't keep a straight face! Yes sir, this movie is top-notch entertainment, and like all Kubrick films, makes a statement about society, and how really ridiculous war really is.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay burst onto the scene in 2000, and has steadily and surely climbed all the charts all across the world.  'Parachutes' is a solid debut effort, and by far the rawest Coldplay album.  The energy is evident on every track, and their guitars and bass also hit a lot harder on 'Parachutes' than their next two albums.  \\"Yellow\\" everyone has heard, and it's certainly a beautiful song.  \\"Trouble\\" was also a single, and worthy of praise.  \\"Shiver\\" is another good song, but the album's magnum opus, and possibly Coldplay's magnum opus to this date has to be the album ender, \\"Everything's Not Lost\\".  'Parachutes' is tight, fit, and a lot of polish lies within the raw energy, which was a sign of things to come for Coldplay.  Recommended, and those looking to get into Coldplay should start with this album.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Deserves a Academy award. A Huge change form the typical soundtrack. Use of a 2 note theme, drums acting as wings and much more. this score is the most respectful score to the movie I have ever heard. Batman Begins not enjoyable on cd if you dont understand it. Definelty the best score I heard for a comic book movie.
B0006L16N8|4.0|'X&Y' has been hyped and touted to infinity and beyond, but the simple truth is, this album is far inferior to another contemporary release - 'Don't Believe the Truth' by Oasis.  None of the songs really rock hard like they did in the previous two Coldplay installments but there are a few gems in this album.  The first single, \\"Speed of Sound\\", is pure pop/rock, and a very nice song.  The title track is also a winner, and bound to be a single as well.  \\"White Shadows\\" is a fast moving song, and probably is the most sonically pleasing song on the album.  The best song on the album is without a doubt \\"Swallowed In the Sea\\", and it is easily one of the best Coldplay songs to date.  'X&Y' breaks no new ground, and can almost be called a little \\"dull\\".  Coldplay makes good music, and 'X&Y' will not disappoint anyone who is already into Britpop.  Recommended.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This, much like Michigan and Seven  Swans, is a fantastic album.  (SOOF-jan) Stevens seems to have a knack for sounding completely different from anyone else, but still sounding somewhat familiar.  this album sometimes sounds like a Sam Prekop sort of neo-jazz, sometimes sounds like a Iron & Wine sort of neo-folk, and sometimes even like a marching band, which in this case, works quite well.  His lyrics are very delicate and well-written and his melodies are the kind that stick with you all day long.  Some of his songs deal with his faith, but he deals with it in a much more realistic way than you would typically hear.  Reminiscent of David Bazan of Pedro the Lion, Stevens avoids the cliche \\"God is great, God is good\\" routine and has a realistic discussion about his beliefs, sometimes he even seems to be questioning them, but always comes back to an understanding of why he believes the way he does.  I usually don't like to talk about specific songs, because I feel an album should stand up as a whole, and this one does, but I have to say that \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" is a fantastic song.  It seriously gives me the chills every time I hear Stevens go into that haunting falseto chorus.  Anyway, all in all, great album, if you like it, buy Michigan and Seven Swans as well.
B0001Z2RUK|1.0|This is boring. All the songs sound the same and it's a bit weird. Every song has that funny jingley sound to it. I don't like it!!!
B000059Z8J|5.0|Christopher Reeve really pulled this off really well. Superman is very entertaining and NOT corny as some people say it is.<br /><br />Even if Christopher has already passed away, I still think that he is Superman and will live as superman forever. He is really humble at heart and has the same goal as superman \\"to change the world and to make a difference\\". I believe this movie was brilliant despite the fact that the quality of New York City looks quite dull because it was made in 1978 anyway. When Superman flies around the city, the background area which is New York City looks sort of unrealistic.<br /><br />Other than that, everything is perfect the way it is. People say that in a series, the first one is always the best. That adage clearly applies to this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Generally speaking, made-for-TV scifi tends towards the lower end of the wonderful spectrum of things possible; there have been notable exceptions (I'm a fan of B5, Farscape, Star Trek:TNG, and more), but I'm usually disappointed by scifi found on air. <br />Not so with Firefly.... <br />The characterization, the breadth and depth of plot (apparently something Joss Whedon is famous for, though I wasn't a fan of Buffy or Angel), and the level on which you are thrust into the story, are all far greater than I have come to expect. While Firefly was clearly a TV show, and thus wasn't able to draw the kind of funding that would have made it even shinier (unlike the movie, Serenity, coming out Sept. 30th), for what it was, it shone. Fox's decision to cancel it was poorly thought-out, to say the least.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|the Foo Fighters continued their amazing run with a dual-disc compelation both highlighting their ability to rock hard as well as  demonstrate a little softer side.  Both work as I prefer the rockin' Disc 1 [Rock] to the mediocre Disc 2 which, despite having great lyrics fails to work due to a monotone sound.  After listening to Disc 2 for a little bit, I still could not differentiate between the songs, maybe it's just me, but, I think the Foo Fighters could have done better on it.  Disc 1 fails to disappoint with great tracks like \\"Best of You\\" and \\"DOA\\" and \\"The Darkest Blues and Black\\" but, again a couple of the songs sound too familiar and lack the variety that was seen on \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\"<br /><br />In response to the copy protection, just like the new Dave Matthews CD, the copy protection can be outsmarted!!!  Just do a little googling, and you should come to a site that will take you step by step--I know i've done it.  It's still a pain for the loyal listeners who want the tracks on their computer in Mp3 format with no hassle.  Don't let that scare you away from a quality CD with plenty of solid songs to keep you busy.
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|Well, I just cannot believe my eyes: <br /> <br />No Booklet, only one disc wich is looking like a bootleg!! <br />Furthermore you have to turn it to see the special features! <br />The Mastering is fine as is the movie,in fact great. <br /> <br />How come this masterpiece deserves such ugly horryfying looks??? <br /> <br />Shame on the resposibles! <br />print this amazon, I dare You!!!!
0064407667|5.0|If you like books with little butterflies, singing  elves and cheery, normal children....this is not the series for you. Violet, Klaus and Sunny quickly became the Baudelaire orphans after a tragic fire kills their parents. They are sent to live with a distant relative, Count Olaf. Little do they know, what he's REALLY trying to do is to get his hands on the Baudelaire Fortune, which Violet, the oldest, is willed to recieve when she comes of age(18). This book is filled with naive adults, an idiot genius and itchy clothing. STOP. If you can't handle the itchy clothing part, back away as far as POSSIBLE. Hey, I warned you. Overall, a great book for a teen with a dubious additude towards \\"happily ever after\\". In the Baudelaires' case, \\"Olaf ever after\\".
B0001NBMBC|1.0|You people who listen to this crap and call it metal are insane this is clearly just the good charlotte of hardcore and its not even hard enough to be called hardcore... first off they have way to many frickin' people in the band... If you're going to have that many people in a band you should at least make some more musical sense than that and have some complex guitar riffs, but they have no riffs that are any good (My band that I'm in consists of 4 sophmores in high school and we can write better crap than this) second off what's so great about this satanic image that they promote cuz it is not working at all in fact that's another reason I refuse to listen to this crappy band because for one I'm a christian, and I am amazed at how us christians can write music that...  <br />A.is True Metal <br />B.is More complex musically <br />C.is Positive <br />D.Attracts way more people to it <br />E.can inspire a person rather than drive him to suicide! <br /> <br />If you guys want some REAL metal check out bands like THE SHOWDOWN, AS I LAY DYING, EMBOYMENT, ZAO, BELOVED, SINAI BEACH, FAR-LESS, AND ANY OTHER BAND SIGNED WITH SOLIDSTATE RECORDS!!!!! <br /> <br />In closing those of you who like slipknot I pity your lack of taste, and by the way I'm not raggin' on this band cuz they're satanic and I'm a christian I'm raggin' on this band because they truly suck and just need to disappear from the music industry!  <br />Throw it up word
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Besides \\"THE LAST FART,\\" this is my all-time favorite western. It is the culmination of Sergio Leone's approach to the genre. Besides the great achievements in music, cinematography, art direction, sound, and editing, what makes this movie the masterpiece that it is is its description of a society in transition and the changes that affect the landscape, the technology available, and the people and their hopes and fears...
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I like to avoid context when reviewing an album holistically, but it's hard not to squelch the myths that have surrounded an album since its release. Such is the case with Franz Ferdinand's self-titled debut; I will be somewhat reactive to the band's role as the critics' darlings of 2004 (by a sort of necessity), but for the record, the album is a perfectly solid one. If I had a friend who raved over it, I would not lose any respect for him or her. Franz Ferdinand has been played off as The Band The Critics Wished The Strokes Had Been, but I can't help but enjoy listening to the overhyped revolutionaries' albums more, even if there is that element of the pretentious and objective critic that holds Franz Ferdinand in higher esteem. Franz is a \\"less is more\\" band that does more for the hell of it, and this makes their album significantly less fun than a snippet or the ubiquitous \\"Take Me Out\\" would lead one to believe.    To solidify definitions, what I call the Strokes Revolution is the most recent era of garage which has turned the genre towards immense accessibility. The Strokes cut down on the number of ideas per song, but made sure each of those ideas could be perfectly executed. It still had some elements of garage rock - the muddy rhythm guitars, the lo-fi vibe manifested in filtered vocals - but there was no messiness or guitar virtuoso complication - in its place crisp, repetitive, virtually danceable tunes. The best thing about the Strokes was that it could play in the background, fill the listener with an oxymoronic soothing energy, and the listener could jump in with their own wavering and flat vocals at the parts they remembered. All this, and they didn't even have to pay particular attention. Sans the few who paid a little too much attention to the magazine covers and hype, no one was disappointed by the Strokes, at least not until their perfectly matching second album. The critics felt like asses as they heard another 11 fun, infectiously catchy background singalongs, and fled to Franz Ferdinand, who they could justify liking.    Franz Ferdinand improved on all the problems the critics suddenly had with the Strokes - four repeated guitar notes became twenty seven, with varying lengths. They tossed in enough light production trickery that the painful illusion of the Strokes recording in their basement was alleviated. At the expense of a little bit of catchiness, Franz Ferdinand displayed slightly more originality and certainly more talent, which to me says they were much more middle-of-the-road than the Strokes. But what's worse, they walk the delicate and thin line between attention-grabbing and background. Some bands can blur the line, but no band under the wing of the Strokes Revolution. The result: you try to let it fade into the background, their penchant for adding just barely too many parts to the songs and writing sweltering, layered instrumental pieces simply demands enough attention that it's irritating. Conversely, if you fold your hands and carefully listen, the opposite happens. You realize the songs lack identity, the singer lacks passion, the technique is monotonous, and the discipline is focused in the wrong direction. Yes, these were problems with the Strokes, but the Strokes did nothing to deserve a huge amount of attention to the music itself.    Again, it's difficult to clarify why exactly I don't fully appreciate the band, because it is a much more balanced entity than their contemporaries. And the CD certainly has its moments; not least within the first minute of the first track (\\"Jacqueline\\") when a sudden storm of rattling guitars, drums and bass floods what originally sounds like a ballad. Places like this and select others fill me with enough respect for the band that I want to jump onto the critics' bandwagon. In fact, about any ten-minute piece of the album you could find would be damn fun to listen to. But somehow the album as a whole is depressing, and it's not just because every songsounds like a single (I can definitely handle that). Ultimately, it's a lot like eating a bowl of chocolate-chocolate chip ice cream and saying that you could live off it. You can't. It's too substantial to ignore and not varied enough to interest. Plus, it's ice cream. You're going to get sick.    I can't recommend this to any of the weird snobs like me who listen to our albums straight through and begrudge the inevitable mp3 overhaul, but I've had circumstances at my slightly more social hours that I've realized this is a great album for the party-hard ADD culture of modern America, like during my musical's cast party where teenagers played a first track, skipped to the single and pitched the CD in a pile for a new one. I'm still glad to own the CD for that piece of me that retains a love of the intoxicatingly social teenage life, even as it's expressed less and less frequently. If for nothing else, check this album out for a commentary on the hip youth of the new millennium, because if this album doesn't reveal that, I don't know what can.    B

B000055Y0X|5.0|`Dr. Strangelove', directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by Kubrick, Terry Southern, and Peter George, the author of the novel on which the story is based is one of those certifiably classic movies which is probably better remembered than the film which happened to win the Academy Award for best picture for 1964. This is truly amazing, as the situation on which it is based, the nuclear standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union is fast becoming a fond memory (in comparison with the difficulties in dealing with terrorism today).<br /><br />Unquestionably the best aspect of this movies for DVD purchasers is how eminently rewatchable it is. I saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and I have seen it on broadcast TV, on VCR tape, and now on DVD at least seven or eight times over the last forty years, and I still find it entertaining and I still find little things here and there which I did not remember seeing before.<br /><br />At the time the film was released, there was a great controversy over who in the United States was the model for the character of Dr. Strangelove. The betting seemed to be allocated 50% to Edward Teller, 30% to Henry Kissinger, and 20% to Werner von Braun. Based on a recent profile in `The New Yorker' on Hermann Kahn, the proper allocation should be about 90% Kahn with only about 10% to von Braun to account for the theme of suppressed loyalty to Nazi Germany. Not only did Kubrick mold the plot around Kahn's theories in his book `On Thermonuclear War', Kubrick insisted that several members of his production staff read the book. Kubrick actually consulted with Kahn on several points and Kahn was not at all unhappy with how Kubrick played out the theory of mutual deterrence that lies at the heart of the plot. Even some of the story elements which seemed totally off the wall such as the `mine shaft gap' were real concerns of Herman Kahn.<br /><br />In case you are totally new to this picture, it is an extremely dark comedy about the events leading up to an unplanned, but certainly not accidental thermonuclear holocaust. Part of the quality of this movie is signaled by the fact that a contemporary serious movie with a similar premise, `Fail Safe', is largely forgotten today.<br /><br />Peter Sellers in three different roles head up the cast. Amazingly, all of his three roles are largely `straight men'. Most of the real humor is played out by his other leads and supporting actors such as George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickins, and Keenan Wynn.<br /><br />I suspect part of the reason this movie got mixed reviews when it was originally released is the fact that there are a number of lines and scenes put into the movie for cheap laughs. The most famous, recently enshrined high in the list of most quotable movie lines is the statement `You can't fight in here, this is the War Room'. At least two or three other scenes are done purely for quick comic relief. The truly most indelible image is one of the final scenes when B-52 piloted by Slim Pickens finally drops one bomb that sets of the climax of the movie.<br /><br />The most effective contribution of the director and the writers is how the classic tension on whether the thermonuclear disaster will be averted, as events sway the probability of the outcome back and forth from doom to survival.<br /><br />This `Special Edition' does not have the one feature that literally doubles the value of the DVD. It has no director/writer/actor commentary, which is totally unsurprising as the director and all the principle actors are no longer with us. But, more is always better, so if the discount on the special edition is good, take it!<br /><br />This is one of those movies like `Ghostbusters' and Animal House' and most of Stanley Kubrick's other movies that I watch at least once every other year. Highly recommended.ark comedy about the events leading up to an unplanned, but certainly not accidental thermonuclear holocaust.

B0009QBLA8|1.0|I don't see why other people think this movie is good. Its very long, and full of nonsense. I like other works by Lynch, but this is just crap. <br /> <br />It is about a person with strange hair who lives in a bizarre dreamlike world.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I really wanted to buy this disc, but after reading some comments on the copy protection posted on the web, I had to take it out of my cart.  As I understand from what I read, the copy protection prevents you from ripping it to your computer, and in turn from loading it on your MP3 player or making a compilation disc which includes music from this CD -- all perfectly legal uses of a music CD under the Home Recording Act.  So, basically, although I would have been paying full price for this CD, the bundle of rights I would normally get with it would be artificially limited by the copy protection technology on it.  As all my music plays from my PC into my stereo, or in my MP3 player at the gym or while traveling, this disc would be virtually useless for me.  I understand the company's desire to protect what they created, but not at the expense of my legal enjoyment of the CD.  Maybe if they lose enough sales this way, they'll stop this annoying practice.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Animatrix is the given view points of the matrix through the minds of some of the great directors in anime;Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), Koji Morimoto (Robot Carnival), and Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop). There not only a great set of directors but through there eyes they always push a stunning an intresting look for the matrix.  <br /> <br />Through the cg- to basic hand drawn animation. All of which have not only deep characters but a deep stories. They seemed to leave you astray in confusion leaving some questions unanswered,if not presenting more.  <br /> <br />Even if some of them are a bit odd and confusing, they don't leave you at the gate except one matriculated and maybe a bit from world record both of these just go too deep where they just end up being eye candy instend of showing any real message. The rest can be confusing but most can pixk up on the basics of the story along the way. <br /> <br /> With all these deep stories and intresting characters, its kind of odd kon(paranoia agent) isn't doing a episode. He would have been perfect. I love all the directors, but he would have been the best for the job. All the episode have a strange sence of direction which they don't do normally, every single work kon has done is just that way deep characters, storylines and a strange bizare twist of real and fantasy, WHICH IS KON!  <br /> <br />In the end, animatrix is a giant sample of sights and sounds from numerous diffrent viewpoints is a great change was and is a great change for the matrix and adds more to the story then the sequels ever could. Why a 4? Cause like I said its a mixbag, some arn't gold. Many are but not all of them, oh and theres no kon:P
B00062IDCO|3.0|The episodes and other details have been covered elsewhere. I would just like to point out a few things: <br /> <br />I'm a huge fan of this series and the previous ones with the exception of DS9, which is plain boring. I love ST Voyager, the first 4 seasons were fantastic, but... enough is enough. I'm sick and tired of the producers' political correctness and pedantry. How many times do we need to hear about \\"humanity\\", \\"individuality\\", \\"holo-rights\\" etc etc etc? These issues have been explored extensively both in the first 4-5 seasons of the series and in Star Trek:The Next Generation. Even in the 6th season, Janeway sacrificed the crew's privileges and their opportunity to communicate with their loved-ones at home just to let the Doctor with the inferiority complex to prove himself worthy of his \\"holo-humanity\\" once again. <br /> <br />Also, Janeway's exaggerated \\"compassion\\" would probably make Jesus to freak out.  <br /> <br />They also made the mistake of over-showing the Borg. One of the reasons why the Borg were so succesful is because they were kept in the dark, full of evil power and mystery. Now, the Borg have become more common than humanity itself. The Borg Queen has lost her fatal and dark power. She's just another petty alien, trying to survive. Alas, Janeway won't let her. In this respect, Janeway's arrogance is unprecedented! Alice Krige was great (and so was Kate Mulgrew), but that is not enough to save the day. <br /> <br />What happened? Did the producers get bored with their own creation? Because that's what it feels like. Knowing when to begin and when to stop is wisdom.  <br /> <br />All good things... in moderation, please. And remember, we still love Star Trek. <br />
B00007H1Y2|5.0|To those people who think I \\"don't get it\\" in my review of \\"Chavez Ravine\\"... honestly I think some of the reviewers on this site are just shills for the music industry, you know, EVERYTHING they review is 4 or 5 stars, some credibility there... here is a CD that can be immediately placed in with some of the greatest instrumental albums, if not the greatest albums of all time. <br /> <br />Folks, it's once in a blue moon that a collection of songs comes along that flows, without ever slowing down in creativity or listenability. The musicians reflect a deep understanding of the tunes they perform, and they never veer off course into some insane atonal nonsense. <br /> <br />Trust me on this, if you like instrumental albums, great guitar tone, great grooves... you don't want to miss out on this one.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Please give this a chance! You cannot expect 4 in the bar rock music with this. It is highly exploratory and inventive.

There is chanting , vocal harmonies,  highly inventive orchestrations, wonderful guitar, bass and keyboard solos as well as extremely moving melodies and harmonic movement.  <br />Highly recommended! try it!
0767903374|2.0|Highly Sensitive People (HSPs) are already sensitive to the role a book like this can play in their ability to take an active approach to self-understanding. Once one's status as an HSP is established, by way of this book's sensitively provided self-tests, the book then goes on to provide the tools to categorise one's sensitivity-type (ST) even further. The rude and insensitive sector of the population (RAIPs) would no doubt be surprised to learn that there are several types of HSP, with different levels of sensitivity depending on the life domain. Introverted, creative, sociable, and worried HSPs everywhere will be grateful to have these tools at their fingertips to increase the depth of their self-awareness on the HSP scale.<br /><br />My own self-awareness journey, however, has been hampered from the beginning by the gaudy colouring of this book's pink and yellow striped cover, with bright green and red overlaid font. Can't the publishers provide a version of the book suitable for highly photosensitive types like myself? We HPSPs are too often undervalued and ignored by the HSP community in general.
0385510454|2.0|This is definitely a step backwards for this author. The story is thin and the characters are difficult to embrace, just the opposite of his earlier works which were rich in plot and had characters that compelled you to keep reading. Even with his early departure from \\"law\\" novels, such as \\"A Painted House\\", he maintained a certain intensity that made me a huge fan. <br /> <br />This latest book leaves me feeling flat. <br /> <br />I cannot help but wonder whether he wrote this book prior to his rise to fame and fortune.
0394800389|5.0|A wonderful, silly Seuss, filled with tongue twisters. Great illustrations. And for adults---I teach ESL, and have a relatively advanced class, but the students' pronunciation isn't great. I tried this out to drill vowel sounds and it was a winner! The students are enchanted with the silliness of it, it makes a boring activity--drilling--fun, and several bought the book for their kids. A great find! Published 40 years ago, Seuss never gets old.
1573223026|5.0|...I loved this book. I don't think people should feel bad for laughing out loud - I didn't feel that Hornby \\"made fun\\" of or made light of the topic of suicide; rather, I felt comforted by the characters he brought to life; even though this is a work of fiction, it made me feel not quite so alone in how I thought or felt. I really could empathize with the characters, too - the shame of my mistakes, the guilt of not wanting to go on when I know that my life really isn't so bad - it was really cool how the characters dealt with their problems - no quick, easy answers yet some other alternatives to throwing one's self off a building. Back to the idea of humor and laughter - laughter is good for you. It felt good to laugh and gave me a different perspective on my illness; I don't think I'll ever think of suicide in quite the same way again, and that's a good thing.

0553212737|5.0|Austen weaves a brilliant tale of Emma Woodhouse, a young socialite, and her community in Victorian England.  Emma cannot resist inserting herself into the affairs and pursuits of her neighbors and dear friends and the resulting chaos is delightful.  Emma is indeed a flawed character, but so are the others in this tale, which makes it all the more authentic.  Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous.  Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times.  Of course in the end it all comes out well but it is a wonderful ride.  Highly recommended.
B00005A3KS|5.0|I saw this movie back in '91 when I was 8 yrs old and I'm a girl.  Does this make me weird?  I don't think so.  I've loved Keanu Reeves since I saw him in the Disney film Young Again and Patrick Swayze since Dirty Dancing, so when these two paired up I couldn't believe it at the time.  And what a pairing it was! <br />   Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen are in this film.  Who has yet to have their face almost put into a lawnmower or chased a surfin \\"Ronald Reagan\\"?  No one because Point Break is a one of a kind original!  This movie also has some very funny and smart dialogue which most action films lack. If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out on some serious hotness by Mr. Reeves, crazy ass antics by Gary Busey, and an over the top but necessary performance by Patrick Swayze.  So what are you waiting for?  Go with the wind and get it now!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|This is a truly astonishing film. I don't know how the director got his cast to buy into the ideas in this film, but to the credit of all involved, they did, and the results are a unique movie experience.<br /><br />Kate Winslett is my favorite actress working in the movies, and her performance here is stunning. Jim Carrey, i'm convinced, is never going to get the kind of recognition his talent deserves. This film will challenge your mind, but, if you give it time to work its magic on you, the rewards are very satisfying indeed.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B0007YBMA6|5.0|On the recommendation of friend, I splurged for the Japan 2-DVD set of \\"King Kong\\" and \\"Son of Kong\\".  I must admit, I was blown away by the quality of this package and promptness of shipping offered by the vendor (thanks zelachowski)!  The images are crisp and vivid unlike the previous VHS release I've watched over all these years.  And, all those scenes that were deleted from the original \\"Kong\\" are here too!  Two gorilla-sized thumbs up for this import double disc!
B000002UAU|4.0|Due to my age I was never able to exeprience this record upon its initial release, and thus I can only attempt to appreciate the level of psychadelic awe in which this surely produced in the first wave of listeners. For those in the mainstream who had no knowledge of avant garde music this must have surely sounded like a musical gift from a strange and distant dimension, and I presume that changed many listeners' perception of reality and art.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|First of all, I had written another review of this album but as I believe it's unfair to write 2 reviews of a CD (messes up the average *'s), I deleted my old one.<br /><br />This album has held up incredibly well over the last 2 years, and I believe it's just as good as Mer De Noms.  The music on here is tough to describe, as many have said.  If you've heard Weak and Powerless, and like it, I think this is for you.  It has more elements of Tool than Mer De Noms, and has less musical complexity (nothing like the leads in the chorus of \\"The Hollow\\"), but it has excellent lyrics dealing with the theme of drug addiction in a beautifully poetic manner in much the same way some of Maynard's other work does (\\"H\\").  This album has it's own melodic style, which is a big plus, even different than Mer De Noms.  \\"The Package\\" is an excellent song with great structuring, a perfect opener... Twiggy's bass is very noticable on this album in general, whereas the bass on Mer De Noms was not memorable to me.  The heavy sections on this album are very tastefully used, only coming in at the times when energy has already been building up consistently for a time... See the \\"The Noose\\" and the aforementioned \\"Package\\".<br /><br />\\"A Stranger\\" is absolutely gorgeous and has replaced \\"Magdalena\\" as my favorite APC song.  \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is a beautifully strange breath of fresh air.  Clearly from the perspective of a delusional (and seemingly insane) patient, it captures of a sense of false happiness perfectly.  Everybody should know by now that \\"Pet\\" is an APC classic.  Just wait till you see them do it live.  \\"Outsider\\" has an interesting point to make and might actually make you think, also has excellent harmonies in Maynard/Billy's unique style.  \\"Weak and Powerless\\" is an exceptionally tight and balanced song where no part is in the foreground, clearly the work of very experienced musicians.  You've most likely heard it if you're on this page.  \\"Blue\\" is ethereal and great.  \\"Gravity\\" is quite a bit like Mer De Noms, could fit on there easily, definitely written by Billy.<br /><br />This album, in the end, is the perfect counterpart to Mer De Noms.  You can't go wrong with this if you love that album.  One last note to people saying this is the 'best album of the millenium so far' or that APC 'saved music' etc... even you Tool/APC fans who know good music when you hear it are missing out on a lot.  There is so much fantastic music the public so unfortunately does not hear.  Just listen to \\"Infinity\\" by Devin Townsend.vity\\" is quite a bit like Mer De Noms, could fit on there easily, definitely written by Billy. <br /> <br />This album, in the end, is the perfect counterpart to Mer De Noms.

B00006RAKP|4.0|I agree with what Vito Corleone below me said. Funderal for a friend and Empty Garden (Hey hey Johnny) are missing and they truly are great classics! I was disapointed for not seeing them on the tracklisting when I first got this album. <br /> <br />Either way it's a strong collection of EJ's best of, except for what I mentioned above. <br /> <br />
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is what started it all.  Linkin Park is at its best and freshest in this album.  And the great variety in the mood and beat of their songs is very desirable.  This album is a must-have for not just a Linkin Park fan, but for anyone who listens to rock music.  An awesome debut album!
B0000025L0|5.0|Having owned this CD for several years and then listening to it TWICE all the way through today not only helped me to realize just how brilliant Stanley Clarke's musicianship is but the kind of emotional and technical support the bassist added to this album.The title track of 'School Days' sums up Clarke's mid 70's musical style perfectly-in the pocket fusion/electric jazz-rock/funk:the entire sound of it with no drama.And the romantic sounds the guy get's on his electric bass on the gentler \\"Quiet Afternoon\\" will sweep you up for sure,as will the upbeat latin stylings of \\"The Dancer\\",a really strong tune as is the funky \\"Hot Fun\\".<br /><br />  On the remaining tracks Clarke switches to the acoustic bass on which he excells at faced paced vamping,and in any genre there is very little he seems incapable of here.Imagination,creativity and impressionism don't seem to be his weak points to say the least.But what makes 'School Days' almost rank as Stanley Clarke's best album ever is the sheer quality of the compositions.They're incredibly strong in either a jazz,rock,funk,fusion or even pop context,and Clarke is sure to cover all five of those bases in every respect.<br /><br />  As years went by instrumental music such as this would be precieved by the public in many different ways.Some of them in (sadly) negative ways with the advent of 'smooth' jazz in recent decades.But in 1976 when this was made that hadn't happened yet-fusion was fusion and it could be any and all things at once without being labeled.And 'School Days' represents this era very well and along with a number of classic albums of approximately the same vintage the strengh of it's music and even melodicism have already been treated very kindly as the years have passed.<br /><br />  So for anyone wishing to thoroughly explore the beauty and dynamics of the bass,especially the electric bass guitar in an instrumental context 'School Days' is very likely the best place for you to go!
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Terrible Keanu Reeves supernatural epic that even makes the last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to it. Keanu does give the worse performance of his career with this turkey and the film itself is almost as bad as his performance with sloppy dialog and lackluster special effects. Rachel Weisz literally gives the only good performance in the entire movie and that's really because she is the only professional actor in it. The rest of the cast is made up of no name actors who make Keanu look like a genius in the acting profession.     See it if you are desperate for entertainment or can't get a date.
B0002HV4VU|2.0|Be warned! While this import sounds amazing, it's not the same mix as the album we all know and love. \\"Jerusalem\\" and \\"Benny The Bouncer\\" feature completely different vocals from Greg Lake.
B000008MLU|2.0|Frank Zappa isn't exactly known for treating his back catalogue very well, with remixes, poor remasterings, and other \\"tamperment\\" dotting his reissue programme. The infamous 1984 remix of We're Only In It For the Money--originally released as part of the \\"Old Masters\\" boxed-set, and later coupled with \\"Lumpy Gravy\\" on this 1986 CD--is *the* example of why certain artists clearly don't have the best judgement when it comes to their old masterworks. \\"We're Only In It For the Money\\" is one of the greatest records of all time, but in this form it is a masterpiece diluted. Yes, the bass and drums are re-recorded; yes, the entire thing is remixed; yes, parts on the original that were \\"censored\\" (although more often than not by Zappa's own hand) are restored. Yet what's far more important is how slipshod the entire effort is. <br /> <br />A bit of history. In the early 1980s, Frank finally seized control of much of his back catalogue, acquiring for the first time many of the masters used to make his earliest albums. Two things occured simultaneously: Frank discovered that many of the older Verve masters were not in optimal condition, suffering from years of neglect in MGM's storage facility; and Frank, enthralled with the promise of 80s technology in general and digital technology in particular, came to the conclusion that the 60s-era fidelity of these recordings was simply unsuited to the new digital climate. Most of the resulting \\"Old Masters\\" LPs were simply \\"digitally tweezed,\\" but Frank used the \\"damaged tapes\\" stories as a pretense to remix \\"Money,\\" \\"Lumpy Gravy,\\" and \\"Cruisin' with Ruben and the Jets.\\" This may not have been controversial in and of itself (Zappa would produce a perfectly suitable remix of \\"Freak Out!\\" in 1987), but Frank *also* decided to re-record the drum and bass tracks on much of Money, Ruben, and Lumpy Gravy (although the remix of \\"Gravy\\" was never released in its entirety). Later, Frank would admit that this particular decision was motivatedless by practical concerns and more by a dislike for the sound quailty and performance of the original tracks. <br /> <br />Whatever the case, the result was disastrous. A previous reviewer points out that the new bass tracks, played by the otherwise-excellent Arthur Barrow, don't sound anything like a 1960s bass track, which is completely true. I find the new drums by Chad Wackerman to be more problematic, however. The drum sound is directly from the Them or Us/Thing Fish era (in other words, digital, likely direct-inject) and sounds terribly freeze-dried. Worse, Chad's tendency to \\"play along\\" with melody lines totally changes the beat of many of the tracks. Zappa's total disregard for the heart and soul of his most celebrated album adds insult to injury, as while the re-record of \\"Ruben\\" is at least competently assembled, \\"Money\\" is marred by off-key instruments (dig the bass during \\"Harry, You're a Beast\\"), poor digital edits  complete with \\"clicks\\" attempting to replicate the originals, faders accidentally left up, and the bizarre decision to speed up several tracks (\\"Concentration Moon,\\" \\"Let's Make the Water Turn Black\\"...perhaps done to alter the drum sound?) to levels of chipmunkdom that far surpass the original's helium-voiced tendencies. It sounds like the sort of rough mix that should have never escaped someone with such a reputation for perfectionism.  <br /> <br />And yet, for some reason, this version of the album was the only one in print for nearly ten years. The 1995 issue of the album isn't a sonic wonder, but it at least captures the spirit that makes the album what it is. I didn't think the 1980s re-record could possibly be as bad as I read, and if you don't know what the original's supposed to sound like you may very well find it to be perfectly enjoyable. <br /> <br />Anyway, enough about \\"Money.\\" The draw of this twofer is the pairing with \\"Lumpy Gravy,\\" \\"Money's\\" sister album and the first Zappa solo disc. I really like the thing, but I knowsome people who've never warmed to its bizarre mixture of spoken word inanity, orchestral pieces, and...well, whatever Frank had lying around. While the sound quality of \\"Gravy\\" on this disc isn't too hot (it, like all of Zappa's 1986 discs, is mastered at an absurdly low volume), it's the only place on CD to find the original mix of the album. The 1995 re-release beats the sound quality of this one by a long-shot, but incorporates some raw mix segments that occasionally vary from the original in mix content and edits between sections. Essential for completists, in other words. <br /> <br />Verdict: I picked up the twofer of \\"Money/Gravy\\" out of morbid curiosity; I had read about the horrors of the remix, but figured it couldn't possibly be that bad. In my opinion, it *is* that bad, but you very well may disagree. That said, the current stock discs are simply a better idea; unless you're a completist who absolutely needs the remix and the totally-original version of \\"Gravy,\\" you're better off avoiding this release.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is...<br /><br />1. One Of These Days - Great instrumental, very dark and intense.<br /><br />2. A Pillow Of Winds - Really beautiful Floyd Song.<br /><br />3. Fearless - Really awesome and moving song with a great riff.<br /><br />4. San Tropez - A nice Floyd tune.<br /><br />5. Seamus - Fun bluesy song with a dog howling.<br /><br />6. Echoes - Amazing 23 minute long epic!<br /><br />One of These Days, Fearless and Ehoes stand out the most and are my favorite songs on this great album by Pink Floyd. It's one of the very next albums people should buy if all they have is The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon. I enjoy it more then The Wall.<br /><br />One of These Days is one of the coolest, darkest, intense instrumentals you'll ever hear! Fearless has one of the best guitar riffs you'll ever hear! Echoes is an epic psychedelic, rock and roll masterpiece.<br /><br />Amazing dark Floyd album that all rock fans should own one day. Now this is the sound I really enjoy by Pink Floyd. Their early years are amazing! Very beautiful, trippy, epic, dark, psychedelic and just darn amazing. The way rock and roll should be. No bands can really top Floyd, some come close though, but I will always love Floyd. I want everything by them...<br /><br />...Meddle was a great addition.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I have the first three and this one is hands down the best of them. Very consistently ambient. Great album.
B000750OEA|5.0|Living in the US, I've only seen a handful of Kylie's videos. (In fact, 25 of the 31 clips here are new to me.) Therefore, this is a welcome addition to the DVD collection. Here we see Kylie go from '80s pop princess to '90s serious chanteuse (a thankfully brief turn) to nouveau-disco diva of the aughts. This disc is fun from beginning to end, the sound is fine, and most of the video transfers are quite good (although some of the earlier stuff seems a bit washed out). All-in-all an excellent purchase, and the videos coupled with the \\"Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head\\" performance leave me wanting her live DVDs now.

B000002KDO|5.0|Great album by Black Sabbath. Nice and dark. Intense and heavy!<br /><br />Master of Reality is a classic album of the 70s. \\"Sweat Leaf\\" starts off the album with a cough and a gut busting riff to be loved by all who love dark heavy music. Another very inspirational album of the metal genre. In my opinion it's just great dark heavy classic rock. \\"After Forever\\" is better then \\"Sweat Leaf\\" and keeps you banging your head to the beat.<br /><br />\\"Embryo\\" is short, good, comes out of no where(kind of made me jump the first time), instrumental and leads you right into the best song on the album \\"Children of the Grave\\" which is a Black Sabbath masterpiece!<br /><br />\\"Orchid\\" is a simple, yet beautiful instrumental. It's not heavy by any means, but it's a really great piece of music. \\"Lord of This World\\" is a great heavy rock song.<br /><br />\\"Solitude\\" must be played loud since it kind of quiet. Very dark, pretty \\"Planet Caravan\\" type of song, which is my 2nd favorite song on the album. I love \\"Solitude\\" for the reason it's very dark, dreamlike and makes me feel like I'm away from home. I bet it would rock even more if I smoked weed. You'll get lost in the song, it is a great song.<br /><br />\\"Into the Void\\" has a cool beat to it then it totally rocks out becoming a classic closing song for Master of Reality.<br /><br />A great album not to be missed, especially by Black Sabbath fans.
6304711905|5.0|This movie must be included in a short list of the best Westerns ever made.  Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday are good and convincing in their roles almost beyond reckoning. <br /> <br />This movie has it all: real, engaging human drama, intelligent dialogue, good character development, characters that cause the viewer to connect with them, humor, lots of action, but not just endless, mindless action, excellent time-piece sets and costumes, good authenticity (that is, no obvious anachronisms with the guns, etc.); and all this occurs with a timeless legend known to all as a backdrop. <br /> <br />This movie gets good right from the beginning with the voice of Robert Mitchum narrating some background information.  Then, early on there are some scenes that truly are nothing less than works of art in this genre.  The scripting and acting is simply flawless in places. <br /> <br />When the bad guys are introduced to the audience as really, really bad, there is a reference to a passage in Revelations that is gripping and ominous.  Also, in this early scene there is a telling look on the face of one of the \\"Cowboys\\" that will become meaningful in the fullness of the story telling.  I had almost given up hope that modern American filmmakers could use such subtlety.  Way to go, guys and gals! <br /> <br />Be sure to pause your DVD when the Earps enter Tombstone for the first time, and carefully read Lester Moor's tombstone in Boot Hill.  That made me laugh out loud.  What a nice touch!  Then, the scene where Wyatt handles the bully Faro dealer - WOW, this is just brilliant and edifying story telling with film. <br /> <br />Another scene that is perfection itself is where the \\"Cowboys\\" meet the Earps and Doc Holliday for the first time (Johnny Ringo twirling his sixgun, etc.).  Movie making doesn't get any better than this. <br /> <br />I will avoid being too specific in my praise, because each viewer should have the opportunity to have the story unfold for them without foreknowledge of exact content, but I do want to give one example of the intelligent, edifying screenplay to which I've been referring.  In an especially poignant moment between Wyatt and Doc, Doc says \\"There's no normal life Wyatt, just life.\\"  There were some smart and talented people writing this stuff. <br /> <br />Load it in your player, get comfy, and just enjoy. <br />
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins shows that it is possible to have a well plotted movie, with CGI effects shine when you have a set of first rate actors playing the roles. <br /> <br />From Bale, to Caine to the Cillian Murphy's absolutely PERFECT Dr. Craine and the even more perfect Liam Neeson the acting not only complements the action and CGI but rises above it. <br /> <br />This is a loose adaption of BATMAN year 1 series it is so well done that I can't wait to see the next one. <br /> <br />I've yet to see another picture this year that was so worth my money and worth yours. <br /> <br />Note to Mr. Lucas, ACTING! ACTING! ACTING!
B000002OX7|5.0|Buy this album! Seriously it is a masterpiece. I have just watched The Kids Are Alright on DVD and was reminded how great the WHO were. Entwistle's bass playing has to be the best the world has seen, Keith Moon on drums (words cannot describe) Daltrey's vocals are superb and Townshend's song writing and guitar playing alike are flawless. The album that rose from the ruins of the \\"lifehouse' project has come to be recognised as the best WHO album and possibly the best album by anyone ever. Do not listen to anyone who tells you this album is anything is anything less than perfect, not a bad song dwells on this album, and even Limp Bizkit's sheer awfulness in their gall to cover the classic Behind Blue Eyes changes that. BUY IT!
B000006TRV|5.0|I love this album, but it is not even one of my top 5 favorite Pink Floyd albums. It's more of a treat when you are watching the movie as well as listening to the music from the film which is basically the same music.<br /><br />What this album needs is When the Tigers Broke Free, which is contained in the film, but not on the album.<br /><br />The Wall is great classic fun with really good music, but I tend to like the bands older pre-Dark Side stuff better. I love everything before Dark Side the best. I do love Dark Side as well. The Wall is nothing like their other stuff, it has it's own unique sound to it. I just prefer their earlier vocals so much more. Their old sound was much dirty, raw and very psychedelic.<br /><br />The Wall isn't my favorite by any means, because it doesn't have long epic songs with awesome guitar solos and beautiful vocals. The Wall has interesting vocals with shorter songs telling a story which I find cool, but my favorite album with a continuing story to it is Tommy by The Who. The Wall is still a great album that every Floyd fan should own, but they need to get out and buy their other albums as well.<br /><br />Hearing The Wall makes me want to watch the movie. I still give the album 5 stars, because I pretty much give every Pink Floyd album 5 stars. They are one of my favorite bands and I love all of their stuff. My least favorite though would have to be Final Cut.<br /><br />Although an awesome album, I listen to it the least of all my Pink Floyd albums. Other albums you should get along with The Wall are Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, Meddle and Piper at the Gates of Dawn. For more obscure ones get Atom Heart Mother, Ummagumma, More, Obscurred By Clouds and Saucerful of Secrets. Late Floyd is pretty cool too.<br /><br />Great band!
B0007XT7V8|1.0|I, like a previous reviewer, feel as though I've wasted my money.  Luckily the CD was $9 at bestbuy - which was actually why I bought it.  Definitely a waste of money though.  This CD is just really mediocre and bland and way too light for my tastes.  Think Creed but worse.
B000059HGY|5.0|As an avid student of history, I've grown used to Hollywood taking liberties when it comes to historical dramas. Sometimes they really go overboard but it's entertaining (\\"Braveheart\\" \\"They Died With Their Boots On\\") and others they fail miserably (\\"Midway\\" \\"Battle of the Bulge\\"). This film is the best of both worlds-reasonably accurate and entertaining. And for it's time (1970) the special effects are exceptional-this is how films of this genre should be done.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I believe I saw this movie late in 2003.  I was so intrigued I read the book of the same title and then O'Brian's remaining 19 novels. I followed that up with Forester's 11 Hornblower novels.  Then I read the 31 novels all over again.    As I watch this movie now, I'm amazed at how much detail it manages to pick up from the novels.  The plot is actually a composite of various themes in the novels, but it is exceptional in depicting ship life and several of the characters, especially Aubrey and Killick.  It is somewhat disappointing, however, in portraying Maturin.  Hopefully, there will be sequels that do more to flush out Maturin's character.      I also highly recommend the A & E Hornblower DVDs.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens is a puzzling character; sometimes naive, sometimes sophisticated, somewhat rustic and yet essentially urban in outlook. But there a few things he never seems to exhibit: crassness, boredom, or jaded irony. Instead he appears defenseless and in full flower on \\"Illinois\\", an album of remarkable breadth, depth and ambition. <br /> <br />It is precisely his lack of sneering superiority that makes \\"Illinois\\" such a treat. These lengthy, wordy poem/songs, these complex instrumental arrangements and daunting pop structures could all be so much ego run amok, like a bad progressive rock album. But that doesn't happen. Instead, we are treated to a song cycle so fresh and honest I hardly know where to start. <br /> <br />From the sweet quietness of the opening number (which turns an actual UFO sighting in 2000 into a revelatory experience) to the nearly presumptuous overture that follows, one gets a glimpse of what will follow. Imagery follows tone follows place follows events both personal and public in a seamless fabric. By the time we are through the title cut on track 3, he has already taken us through a small American symphony of ideas. We have wondered about God and aliens, considered the great icons of the state of Illinois, met with the ghost of Carl Sandburg and wondered if we are being honest with our art in the first place; surely one of the most breathtaking 11 minutes I can recall on CD. <br /> <br />The mood is quietly shattered with \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr.\\", probably the most haunted song in recent memory. If this one doesn't make you choke a little, check your pulse. By portraying a serial killer as human after all, he draws our attention to the flaws in every heart. He understands that demons have no souls, but people - even mass murderers - do. Watch out. <br /> <br />Several reviews have commented on Sufjan Steven's Christianity. While is it true that there are references to his faith throughout, it is presented so tenderly and with such openness that it is frankly above criticism and simply a part of the undeniable human experience. Whatever truths and doubts he mentions by way of faith are shared by us all, from atheists to the most devout. So while I do not share his faith I do share the common condition and so understand what he means perfectly. <br /> <br />I could continue, but really I just want people to hear this album all the way through, carefully. Good headphones are revelatory for this one. To shuffle the songs or pick out a few is almost a crime - \\"Illinois\\" is a complete work of astonishing freshness, and I find it difficult to imagine how it will be topped in the next 6 months. <br />
B0006L16N8|1.0|Predictable and careful.  Boring and pretentious.  I agree they have some hooks, yet they usually keep playing the same hook over and over again until you feel bludgeoned, a la \\"Clocks\\" <br /> <br />I am still waiting for them to \\"hit one out of the park\\" like they are supposed to.  Maybe their fourth album will be an \\"Unforgettable Fire\\", and their fifth \\"Joshua Tree.\\" but as of yet they are treading water.
0767817478|5.0|i know i'm not the only one who thinks this but the original godzilla movies are very cheesy and very badly acted. in this version of godzilla he gets one big bad makover and wreacks havoc on none the less new york city. the movie starts out explaining a vague refreanse that godzilla was mutated from nuclear waste on a french island. then he makes his way to new york and hopes to breed there, yes its a he and its sounds totally ridiculous gigving some lame answer that it produces asexually. anyway now a team of scientist have to stop his babys from hatching or its curtains for everyone. this movie can be defined as a little bit only as a popcorn movie but its really great movie to watch on the last day of school
B000819PKC|5.0|Many people who vote a review as helpful, only vote it if they agree with what is being said. So I'm attempting to make this review as helpful as possible and not just \\"This CD is totally awesome, go and buy it!\\" Let's proceed then: <br /> <br />First of all this CD is NOT recommended to those who are stuck in a time warp and only prefer the old sound of Jamiroquai. Well I'm sorry but it's not gonna happen. Since Synkronized and A Funk Odyssey, JMQ has shown us they can alter their acid jazz routine and change to funk/disco. They have gone even further in A Funk Odyssey by adding a totally new sound, which some describe as almost 'rocky.' This can especially felt in Stop Don't Panic and Twenty Zero One. In addition the sounds on this CD is far more computerized and electronics. Moreover the lyrics have veered off politics and saving the Earth: it's mainly to do with love. So here's a warning for those who want JMQ to go back to there own way: it ain't happening and it never will. JMQ are happy with their new style. And for those of you who like both the old and new, well then let's go! <br /> <br />The album starts with Feels Just Like It Should (4.34). FJLIS is one of two 'rock' songs in the album. The intro is actually Jay's voice against the microphone, like a beatbox. The song is basically about finding quick love via a 'Candyman' (just watch the video!) and making it fast and cheap. Can be interpreted in many way, but I'll leave if for the more adventurous minds ;) The song is fast paced and funky, cutting edge and retro. A good start to the album 10/10 <br /> <br />Dynamite (4.57) the album title comes up next and this song can be described as the more `funky' songs in the album. It's quite a mellow disco song, with an almost whispering voice. This song is about a girl being `Dynamite.' The beat is slow tempoed and the chorus depends on its strong strings and electronic beats. `I'm in ecstasy' sung by Jay is done is a computerized voice 8/10 <br /> <br />SevenDays In Sunny June (3.57) is like the good old sultry mellow feel-good songs with the acoustic guitar playing a main role and doesn't have electronic sounds in it. It is also the next single. The song is contemplated with Jay's breathy voice going `ooh ooh so baby let's get it on' (another love song). This song surely would appeal to fans of the `old style' I'm sure! 8/10 <br /> <br />At number 4 comes Electric Mistress (3.56), (also the third single) which introduces as new type of `Jamiroquai style.' So far we've discovered acid jazz (sadly none of that is this album), funkrock, disco and mellow. Now we come to Electric Mistress, which is a cross between disco and electronic creepy music! The music is disco-ey but not the friendly groovy type. This music is deep bassed funky, and slightly hypnotically creepy. Not rock but definitely an old style song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Starchild (5.13) is a nice mellow/disco song. Jay finally doesn't sing about love (and sex) but about  a Starchild coming down to save the world of it's problems. A funky groovy track that is slightly mellow and slowish. 9/10 <br /> <br />Loveblind (3.33) is another creepy weird disco song. It's about a girl making Jay love blind. But the music in this is just...weird. Jay sings in an almost pop-ish tone at the chorus :S And the lyrics! \\"All black leather like a disco bitch!\\" What is he on about?! Definitely the most electronic-sounding song. The verse/middle is back to funky happiness and then the bridge is an attempt on being jazzy. Three styles in one! As the most varied after all that rambling...I like it :-) 8/10 <br /> <br />Talullah (6.06) is a lonely mellow song (like SDISJ) about Jay's love running away from him and catching an aeroplane. The longest song on the album, it is filled with emotion and the only music that can be heard (free from the computers though) is drums, guitars and trumpets accompanied with a backing track all sung very gently. This is not the best song but would appealto those who like the old style 7/10 <br /> <br />The eighth song is (Don't) Give Hate A Chance (5.00) A disco/funky song, and definitely the most lively! Whilst Dynamite and Starchild are indeed disco funk, they are far more mellow than DGHAC which reminds me of Canned Heat. Great music with great lyrics, about how hate is wrong and we should learn to love. A great loud vivacious song with lots of instruments. 9/10 <br /> <br />Next comes World That He Wants (3.12). I won't much about this apart from the fact that it is just like Black Crow, lyrics and all. Black Crow sits in his tree watching how the world is, and He watches the world and wishes it was better. For those of you who doesn't know what Black Crow is like: a very minimal song with no beat or bass, only strings right at the very end, depending on Jay's voice to keep it alive. Not really a favourite but if you like Black Crow you'll like this (see? I AM useful :P) 5/10 <br /> <br />The best song in the whole album is Black Devil Car (4.47)! This song is my FAVOURITE for many many reasons. Perhaps I'm being bias but this song is so unbelievably great, it makes the invention of paperclips inferior. (Ok ignore that last part, my weird sense of humour ^_^) It's the other `rock' song on the album. Now every album needs a song that's a little bit different, dirty and quirky. And BDC provides that. It's a song basically about sex, with references to `pushing my thrust up you' and using a car as a metaphor for a woman. It's got a lot of funk rock in it, fast and furious and if you thought FJLIS was rocky, you haven't heard this! With super slick lyrics and funktastic guitar riffs it is one of those songs that is guaranteed to make you dance (or something else!) and make you generally happier. It is also a very instrumental song with electric guitars, synthesisers thrown in, along with the usual drums, trumpets, bass and strings. I wouldn't be surprised if this makes a single. This song is so excellent I wouldn't care if the whole album is rubbish (which it's not!) because it has gripped my heart strings and refused to let go 11/10 <br /> <br />The last song on the album for people who haven't got the American version is Hot Tequila Brown, which is quite mellow and doesn't really have any variance throughout. The chorus is very much like SDISJ. However the bridge is veering towards the deep bass category (see Electric Mistress) but unfortunately doesn't stand out for me. There is a good smooth electric guitar riff in it but sadly it doesn't have much going for it. 7/10  <br /> <br />Time Won't Wait (5.01) is the last song on the UK release and is a good way to end the album. The introduction is a bit like Where Do We Go From Here? Quite a funky song, which is quite strange with the lyrics. The lyrics are sung is a cheerful way, but the lyrics explains time ticks away until you die, so don't waste it! The chorus is very funky and dancy. 8/10 <br /> <br />Overall this album is certainly different (especially from EOPE and ROTSC!) but this new direction is brilliant. Jamiroquai continue to please me, and this 6th album deserves some recognition. So to beat those hard days I recommend a good dose of Dynamite served up with essence of Virtual Insanity and sprinkles of Canned Heat :D
B0008KLVG4|5.0|forget the extremly bloated book, the crappy sequels, and the so called special addition. jaws is in fact one of my favorite movies, it has a raw quanity that makes you scared. when it came out in 1975 it scarred the crap out of people and the beachs became extremly quiet. this movie also takes not a make belive monster but a real life animal. the movie is about a resort town terrorrized by a great white shark. when the town offers a reward to kill it three poeple, a sheriff, a scientist, and a loney fisherman head out to take down the beast. the terror is big and the sequences are breathtaeking, this will remain one of the best creature movie made. oh and for those looking to remake the fil here are two things. one, it better be better then the original and two if not, don't make it at all to soil all over it.
0140177396|5.0|<br /> <br />The classic Steinbeck novel Of Mice and Men takes place during the Great Depression in the mid 1930's.  The two main characters are Lenny and George who are migrant workers heading to a new job on a ranch area in rural Soledad, California.  The first main character, Lennie, has a mind of a little child, but a body and strength of a giant.  He always relies on George as a friend and a traveling companion.  Lennie always gets in trouble because he does not know his own strength.  The second main character, George, is Lennie's opposite in every way.  George has a keen mind and is small and lean.  These two companions help each other throughout the story, but it is up to George to decide the future of Lennie. <br /> <br />The main focus of this book is based on Lennie and George's relationship and how they protect each other from the world.  Lennie gets in trouble by petting the boss' son's wife.  After Lennie's hand gets caught in her hair, she starts panicking.  Lennie gets scared of all the noise she is making, so he covers her mouth and accidentally breaks her neck.  Lennie hides because the other migrant workers found out and going to lynch him.  George knew where Lennie was hiding so he took the boss' gun and shot Lennie in the head out of mercy, because Lennie would have otherwise died in a painful way by hanging. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this novel written by John Steinbeck is a wonderful and well-written book that leads the reader on a journey through the exploration of human existence and compassion.  I really felt I was living through the characters lives and habits.  This book brought me into a world during the Great Depression.  I felt that I was a migrant farmer watching this every time I was reading this book.  I really enjoyed this book and really felt what it was like back then.  I recommend this book to any person who loves to read about history and feel what it was like before.   <br />

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Have been a eagles fan since the beginning seeing them play at a collage in Wilkes-Barre. PA to about 100 people. Have been working on a series of prints and the eagles have been a constant in my studio from 7:00am till 10:00pm and the DVD<br /><br />has given me more inspiration. Thanks to all, especially Joe Walsh.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Being a Christain myself I really wanted to see this film, but i have no idea how it would impact me. I went sprits high and joyful with my church youthgroup and left speechless but turly touched. It shows what Jesus really did for you and me. I remember saying all through the Movie `Stop it stop it!` But really Jesus didn`t stop for the true love he has for his people. Mel did a great job with capturing the reality of the life of Jesus and the language and everything. <br /> Awesome movie take a box of tissues to the movies and get your heart changed.
B000A6CLL0|1.0|Many will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but I hope you at least read why. <br /> <br />Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action \\"Star Trek\\" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original \\"Star Trek\\" series of 1966-1969), 200 years before the time of Captain Picard (during the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" of 1987-1994) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\". <br /> <br />The new series, entitled \\"Enterprise\\", debuted in the fall of 2001, months after the previous \\"Star Trek\\" series, \\"Voyager\\", concluded its seven-year run.  As the show's title implies, the ship used in the show was named \\"Enterprise\\" and had serial number NX-01 with a maximum speed of warp 5.  It's crew was comprised of Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show \\"Quantum Leap\\" of 1989-1993), Vulcan science officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), pilot Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), ship's communications officer Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), the Denobulan Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), weapon's officer Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) and ship's engineer Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer). <br /> <br />With over 12,000,000 viewers watching the first season's premiere episode, it looked like UPN would have another successful \\"Star Trek\\" series, just as it had with \\"Voyager\\".  Unfortunately, subsequent shows had ever-shrinking audiences.  The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  UPN nearly cancelled the show after the third season, but decided instead to give it one more chance with a fourth season.  Unfortunately, with only an average of about 3.1 million viewers per fourth-season episode, UPN did finally cancel the series in 2005 even though there were still another three seasons yet to be produced. <br /> <br />Why, then, did \\"Enterprise\\" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 \\"Star Trek\\" fans living in the U.S.A.?  I include several possible overall reasons:  mostly uninteresting characters (except for Dr. Phlox and T'Pol), lack of connection with the other \\"Star Trek\\" TV series (except the fourth season), the introduction of species (the Suliban and Xindi) that had never previously been known in \\"Star Trek\\" and all-too-often mediocre writing (except the fourth season).  The third season, though popular with some people, I found to be the most problematic of all: <br /> <br />1. The entire third season was a single story arc about Captain Archer trying to find out who the Xindi are, then, once finding them, figuring out how to stop them from using an even more powerful weapon to completely destroy Earth after they used a smaller weapon at the end of the second season to kill 3,000,000 Earth residents.  This should have been done in no more than 4 episodes, not 24. <br /> <br />2. If you have watched George Lucas' original 1977 \\"Star Wars\\" film, you'll quickly realize that the Xindi's ultimate planet-killing weapon was nothing new: it was simply a copy (somewhat smaller) of George Lucas' spherical \\"Death Star\\" from 27 years earlier. <br /> <br />3. During the third season, it is revealed that the Xindi are carrying out the wishes of an advanced species from 500 years in the future to build the \\"Death Star\\" copy to destroy Earth in the past rather than being at war with Earth in their present. This sounds awfully familiar with the plot of \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\", in which the Borg travel to Earth's past so that it will be assimilated in the present.  Who were two of the principle writers of \\"First Contact\\"?  Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who was also one of the producers of the film.  In other words, the Xindi story arc that occupied the entire third season was a rehashing of the plot from \\"First Contact\\" (which was less than 2 hours), as well as a poor copy of part of George Lucas' work from \\"Star Wars\\". <br /> <br />Given that the five live-action \\"Star Trek\\" TV series represent 28 years of TV broadcasts, I regard the third season of \\"Enterprise\\" to be the least entertaining of them all since it was completely wasted on the Xindi story arc.  The wonderful work of reconnecting \\"Enterprise\\" to the previous \\"Star Trek shows\\" that Manny Coto managed to do during the fourth season of \\"Enterprise\\" could have been done during the third season had the Xindi story arc not been done at all or limited to 4 episodes.  What I and many other \\"Star Trek\\" fans had expected would occur during \\"Enterprise\\" was the Earth-Romulan War as eluded to in the original \\"Star Trek\\" TV series, as well as the formation of the United Federation of Planets (UFP); not a war with a never previously known species.  Unfortunately, the premature cancellation of the show, which I blame in large part to the poorly conceived Xindi story arc, prevented the Earth-Romulan War from being portrayed, and the actual events that lead to the formation of the UFP could only touched on in the fourth season. <br /> <br />Consequently, I rate the third season of \\"Enterprise\\" with 1 out of 5 stars.  Of the 24 third-season episodes, the only one that is particularly memorable is \\"Doctor's Orders\\", in which Dr. Phlox remains the only crew member awake during a crossing of a treacherous region of space. (This, too, was a rehash of \\"Voyager\\" episode \\"One\\".) Sadly, it wouldn't be until the fourth season of \\"Enterprise\\" that the show truly blossomed under the guidance of Manny Coto, but it came too little too late to save it from cancellation.
0790744295|4.0|This DVD is dated but nevertheless quite enjoyable at times. Divided into 5 stories, the sum of this movie is not as good as some of its parts. The first sketch, \\"Father's Day\\"  is pure camp and sometimes gruesome but it works. Things go downhill with the second and third sketches - but the fourth, with Hal Halbrook, Fritz Weaver, and a hilarious Adrienne Barbeau is great fun. The final sketch, \\"They'll Creep Up On You\\" is my personal favorite. E.G. Marshall is perfect as a hateful, pompous millionaire who loathes people and bugs. If you picture Donald Trump as Upson Pratt, screaming at the 911 Operator that he is being overrun by bugs, the scene is even funnier. Sadly, the DVD is devoid of any extras.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I discovered Coldplay a few years back around the time of \\"Rush of Blood To The Head\\" and I must say I think they keep getting better.  I am a modern British rock fan though and I love their combo of classical instruments (piano) and more electronic.  And I don't care if he named his daughter Apple, Chris Martin can sing!
1401206905|5.0|Batman: Year One, written by Frank Miller and art by David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis was a break-out follow-up to The Dark Knight Returns, yet while the Dark Knight was a retirement story of sorts, Year One was a \\"Batman Begins\\" story.  Miller retells the origins story with steady narrative and character development that brings to life old friends, some of whom go back to 1939.<br /><br />Miller gives Gordon a major part and as Batman is begging, Gordon is arriving and the developing relationship is thoughtful and plausible.  The Catwoman is introduced, but subtly so, giving the reader who knows the future a hint of her origins as well.  The tag for the Joker is great (similarly borrowed for the new Batman movie as well as year one's book 3 where Batman is being hunted by SWAT and calls his bats to help out).<br /><br />Frank Miller helped bring comic story telling to the modern era and us comic fans are eternally grateful.  I have this story in many versions, and this special addition has extra photos and notes that are fun for the avid collector.
6304366078|5.0|Giving the movie five stars is a no brainer.  Everyone who ever managed to see this film in a theater loved it.  Eva Marie Saint had a pretty long career as a leading lady considering she wasn't glamorous and she wasn't sexy, though she often played in sexy parts.  Most often she was the blonde madonna type, chic and shiny, as in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and she had Actors Studio cachet, people thought she was a serious actress.  She was fine playing opposite Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT and with Paul Newman in EXODUS.  She played Kitty, the American visitor to Israel, and sometimes in GRAND PRIX she seems to be channeling all of \\"Kitty's\\" mannerisms, for both parts allow the US viewer to somehow enter, through her eyes, a complicated and complex European social system we might otherwise fail to register with.  This is what she does best, and as the journalist Louise Frederickson she goes right to the heart of the matter, travelling on an expense account through Monaco, Nice, Monza, everywhere the story of Formula One takes her.  And what a story it is!<br /><br />As soon as Monaco explodes into the fiery crash that injures poor Scott Stoddard, we see that Pete Aaron is carrying around the burden of guilt for this accident, even though Scott himself went in with his eyes open.  This gives GRAND PRIX a good dramatic edge that some of the other racing movies don't have.  Such as LE MANS or WINNING, even though I like them both too.  Here in GRAND PRIX director John Frankenheimer lets us see Aaron's inner working out of his guilt.  At the same time we see Yves Montand struggling through his conflicts about racing politics and his own preference for l'amour.  The two storylines ping and pong back and forth creating their own tension.  This is one feature that belongs on DVD pronto.  And while they're at it, tell me, what about THE GAMES with Ryan O'Neal?  Not a racing picture per se, but it is the Olympics version of GRAND PRIX, with Charles Aznavour playing the Yves Montand part.  I don't think THE GAMES came out even on video!  What's the story and why are they suppressing the great movies about competition?  THE GAMES is from a treatment by Erich Segal, the author of LOVE STORY, and features his LOVE STORY ephebe Ryan O'Neal in a prominent role.  O'NEAL plays an Ivy League sprinter, a golden boy, who decides to enter the Marathon at the Olympics with a little assist from his best friend, Sam Elliott, whose deep deep voice is put to good use as he joins O'Neal in a Tokyo hot tub and calls him \\"baby\\" throughout in a Barry White baritone.  When O'Neal tries to recover from not enough sleep, Sam Elliott hands him a pill.  Then when the runner stumbles in the business section of Tokyo, Sam flags him down and palms him off with another pill.  You know trouble is on its way!<br /><br />But what about Stanley Baker, the most brooding masculine man in British acting, coming over like Heathcliff and dominating not Cathy Earnshaw but tall, bumbling Michael Crawford in his full Frank Spencer mode straight out of \\"SOME MOTHERS DO `AVE `EM.\\"  Crawford plays a milkman, Harry Hayes, who gets taken up by the toffs who run the Royal Running Club and match him up with tyrannical, overbearing coach Stanley Baker.  In one scene Crawford flops around a padded room, wearing extra clothes, while the thermostat registers 150 degrees, while Stanley Baker barks orders, while himself stripped for comfort down to a skimpy pair of white bikini underpants.  It is bizarre indeed.<br /><br />Well, so is Charles Aznavour as the Czech track god Valcek, once the world record holder and now ordered at age 41 to re-enter the Olympics by his Communist boss to give Communism a good name.  And there is an Australian story with an aborigine abused and misused by two white yobbo trainers slash bookies.<br /><br />A great show with lots of action and a wonderful performance by Leigh Taylor Young as a coed Ryan O'Neal takes a shine to.<br /><br />In the meantime at least we have GRAND PRIX on VHS!ast we have GRAND PRIX on VHS!
B0002S947K|5.0|If you have ever heard of the singer Amos Lee and you like his music, then I definitely think you'll like Ray LaMontagne (granted, Ray did come out first). Ray LaMontagne is another artist that I was introduced to on this site, and I have to say that I'm glad I was.<br /><br />A lot of the other reviewers are comparing Ray to Van Morrison, but I personally think that it's still a little too early to say that. It's not that the album isn't great, though; standouts include \\"Forever My Friend\\" and the title track. Other good songs are the \\"All the Wild Horses\\", the socially conscious \\"How Come\\" and, well, everything. Pick up this album for some top-quality music, because you should be able to enjoy Trouble with no trouble at all.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000003493|5.0|i brought this album from barnes and nobles just to see what it sounded like, since im a big fan of the 60s. i love this album! the original versions of the garage rock classics. i especially like the songs I see the light and why pick on me, which i never even heard of before i got the album. another great rhino compilation!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen the Phantom of the Opera 33 times all over the world. (Guess you could say I enjoy it). Do not buy this looking for a duplication of the live theater. DO buy it for itself! Enjoy it as a stand alone great version of ALW's PTO. I may be able save thousands of dollars in future airfares, hotels & tickets now that I have this DVD. Rich sound and color. The movie seems somehow to be an even more intimate experience than the theater. I think it is the extreme closeups of the emotions on the faces. The young lady playing Christine has perhaps the best voice & delivery of all that I have heard. The Phantom is no Michael Crawford or Colm Wilkerson but again don't compare - just ENJOY!
B00007KWHG|5.0|this 4 seasons CD is great. it has all of their classics. i just have one comment to make though. ive heard of stereo versions in rag doll and lets hang on, but they still sound good in mono. The songs are all the original versions, and digitally remastered. Rhino, you rock!
B0000020C4|5.0|I was raised on this CD as the cream of the crop as far as Les Mis recordings.  Even after years of faithful listening, I am still moved to tears by many of the songs on this recording (\\"Drink With Me,\\" \\"Stars,\\" \\"Epilogue\\").  There is not a sour fruit in the bunch, and each preformer radiates such passion that it is impossible to skip over any track. <br /> <br />Colm Wilkinson (Jean Valjean) - I could give him endless praise for his strong, emotional songs, fantastic voice and yet a very familiar feeling about him.  He puts on no airs as the lead man, but takes his role and shapes the CD from the first track to the last.  An excellent preformance. <br /> <br />Philip Quast (Javert) - I am so convinced of his preformance every time I hear him sing that I am shocked in the DVD to see him playfully jesting with Wilkinson.  He becomes his character, showing passion and determination without showing rage, even in some of the high tension songs between him and Valjean, such as \\"The Confrontation.\\" <br /> <br />Ruthie Henshall (Fantine) - I am a fan of her, though I can see how she is a select taste as well.  Her voice seems a perfect match for the role, as though Fantine was written for her.  \\"Come to Me\\" is probably her strongest piece on the CD. <br /> <br />Lea Salgona (Eponine) and Judy Kuhn (Cosette) - While it is obvious that these women have amazing talent and a great sense of themselves as preformers, something about them just hit me the wrong way.  I think Salgona is a bit overrated in \\"On My Own,\\" but that is really my only sense of dislike with her.  And Kuhn's voice I just find to be a trifle obnoxious, high and screechy, so that it does not flow smoothly with the rest of the cast.  Disappointing. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast is fabulous as well, pay particular attention to the gentlemen at the barricade, and little Gavroche as they leap in and out of roles.  They make the show far more emotional than anyother, and to hear them sing is so magical. <br /><br />If you enjoy this CD as much as I did, you might be especially interested in the DVD of this concert.  Watching the characters interact, despite their concert preformance, really makes the story come alive.
B0000508U6|4.0|I started listening to Coldplay in 2004, so my first purchase of their albums was the magnificent \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" which just got better upon each listening. I followed up with \\"Parachutes,\\" an extremely mellow album for a band this popular, which I liked too, just not as much.  Recently, I picked up \\"X&Y\\" which finally took my breath away after about the fifth listening, when I finally could hear a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />With \\"Parachutes,\\" Chris Martin and gang boldly declared that they would take their time when playing their songs.  Indeed, the fastest track (which not so coincidentally became the \\"hit\\" song on the album) is the rather slow developing love song \\"Yellow,\\" which I have to admit is one of my favorites on \\"Parachutes.\\"  The band crafts each song quite deliberately, starting with the understated \\"Don't Panic\\" (singing sarcastically, \\"We live in a beautifiul World\\").   <br /> <br />All the songs are quite good, but, in my opinion, none reach the level of, for example, \\"Clocks,\\" \\"Daylight,\\" \\"Square One,\\" or \\"White Shadows,\\" to name but two examples from each of Coldplay's subsequent albums.  Besides \\"Yellow,\\" I would say my other favorite song from \\"Parachutes\\" has to be \\"High Speed,\\" especially the part where Martin sings \\"The confidence in you,is confidence in me, is confidence in high speed.\\" <br /> <br />I agree with the many favorable reviews given to this album.  What I can't quite understand though is how someone can prefer it to \\"Rush of Blood\\" and \\"X&Y\\" which, I believe, are both superior in every respect.
B00006RYIQ|5.0|Some might say that this album is a tough listen, a \\"fans only\\" release to be appreciated only by Clark freaks, but I think that any MOJO-reader, discerning-type '60s-'70s listener will at least enjoy it, if not flat-out love it like I do. Americana, soul, psychedelia, and gorgeous string arrangements create a cosmic stew around Clark's country-gentleman vocals and profoundo lyrics. Brilliantly recorded and arranged, this album deserves to be heard. Just listen to Clark's voice in the song, \\"From A Silver Phial\\" when he sings, \\"She said she had a mind that slept inside tomorrow/ and only time would heal its scars,\\" or the chilling steel guitar on \\"Silver Raven\\".
B000274THQ|5.0|All great comedy - truly great comedy - not merely spoof, explores emotional issues so deep that when you reach down that deep the only way to deal with it is to laugh. You have to laugh so as not to cry all the time. This is the rare comedy that brings you to that point.     The issues here are about living in a brave new world with new values and facing up to the loss of the old ones. It is about political upheaval and the emotional ones that accompany them. People from the former Eastern block say they recognise the figures in this movie like the old headmaster, a pillar of authority in the old order but a drunken has-been in the new one, or the celebrated German Democratic Republic cosmonaut who drives a taxi in the new world order. They are all delightfully halarious figures, but beneath the laughter they embody what is a sorry reality in a former Eastern Germany with its +20% unemployment rate. It is also about a past in which a Germany was torn in two and the family upheavals that this lead to, and then having to face up with its consequences. But ultimately it is a story of a son's dogged devotion to his dying mother - a love that knows no bounds.    The cinematography too is highly memorable - the scene with helicopters carrying out the statue of Lenin is very powerful for example. In fact the whole way the story is allow to unfold reveals the hand of a masterly director. As for the cast there is not a single weak link and the whole ensemble of actors comes together for a unanimous outburst of inspiration.    This is a truly wonderful movie - genuine funny, charming and heartwarming in equal measure. All movies should be this lovely and for that this has to be one of my favourite films of all time.    Very highly recommended to all and sundry, young and old!
B00005JNJT|5.0|While Batman Forever focused on the psychology of destruction and human emotion's justification power, the psychology, or rather, mental illness, of Batman Begins shows the power of mental thought in healthy individuals (no body problems or mental disorders that prevent ordinary function with humans or travel) and also recorded that feeling when applied to the sense of the unknown. <br /> <br />Hence Batman is a rogue warrior trying to be different from all other fighters. The movie portrays him as a man trapped in China trying to find his way to his soul. He will do anything to mess up his mind and life to get to the ultimate form of combat. He trains with a group known as the League of Shadows (with the excellent Liam Neeson) and even learns how to get along with them. At the end, in a surprise, he breaks free of them and kills them all (by accident or by skill) in an explosion, saving Neeson, who is his trainer. The skill of teaching must be respected in this case. <br /> <br />However, that is the most (or least) Batman, played by the excellent Christian Bale, will allow. He will preserve the art and skill of a fighting technique, but otherwise trusts entirely to gadgets, and of course, Wayne Enterprises and his luxurious outfit. However, his fearless devotion to being seen as mentally unstable yet accomplishing his goal is something to be lauded for sure. <br /> <br />The film's main antagonist is an insane lawyer who locks people up in Arkham Asylum, scene of most of the villains' demise in the cartoons, if you're a fan of those. While I've not read the comics, I do know that the movies are gently entertaining, and don't dispute with them, nor conceive of something better or worse. What's interesting is his use of a spray that makes all those who breathe it fearful of everyone around them. Then a fight ensues of a different kind on the island where the asylum is located. Batman has trained himself for this moment and has an antidote, and it's here where the fighter's skills show up. <br /> <br />Trained to be aware of the fear, not just merely know it, and capable of making his enemies ten times better at fighting him due to his weakness, his ultimate awareness leads not to boredom, but to insight. His ultimate insight: Save the girl, win the movie, be a good hero, makes others into heroes as well. <br /> <br />At the end of the movie, you're treated to a nice look at the beginning of the original Batman. The Joker is his next villain. A nice end to a climactic, and very spiritual, script.
B000002O5L|5.0|If you like good rock n roll that has more than just a pounding drum then welcome home.  Tom Petty has never gotten the recognition he deserves, at least in my opinion.  If you had to pick one albumn by any artist to demonstrate all that is good and fun with Rock music Full Moon Fever would be worthy of that.  Fifteen years later I still pull this out frequently and listen to every song.  Time defines a classic and this sounds as good today as it did fifteen years ago.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Among this slew of bands that sound \\"like Radiohead\\", most of them unwisely (in my opinion) travel the plain Coldplay Travis route.  Muse... doesn't.  Most of the tracks have a hard rock minor key urgency like Iron Maiden and Freddie Mercury are chasing them, trying to give them an enema of boiling water. <br /> <br />I'm sure there could be some good lyrics in there, but I haven't heard a word yet, and I don't want to ruin the rock-out buzz I've got here.
068987474X|3.0|Kudos to the author for speaking the un-sugar coated male point of view to a lot of these situations that women run into.  He's right on many accounts. Women simply shouldn't waste time with men who aren't crazy about them.  This book is helpful to women who already know that they need to say goodbye to the bad \\"relationship\\" in their life and just needed one final push to do so. This is the book for them. <br /> <br />But as far as providing insights into understanding guys, I'm afraid it wasn't that insightful.  All he kept saying was that catch-phrase \\"he's just not that into you.\\" But then again, what woman wants to waste time understanding the guy who doesn't want her? Moving on is the best answer.  <br /> <br />While this is only my own personal reaction to this book, but I found its tone of voice to be harsh and condescending.  By constantly repeating the catch-phrase that his readers are not wanted, doesn't do much for their self-esteem.  Which, I think, is a definitely miss on the author's part because many of his target audience, could use some help in improving their self esteem.  (Otherwise, they wouldn't need to buy his book to understand why men don't want them!)  Also, he makes it sound like that men are doing the women a favor when he pays attention to her.  Assuming that all of his women audiences are sniveling grovelers who would do anything to get male attention is insulting.  Maybe the women he's talking to could do better in letting go, but they should never have to appologize for wanting love.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002A46|5.0|I listen to this CD everyday during the holidays. I love every song on it, especially Miss You Most (At Christmas Time), Christmas (Baby Please Come Home), and Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child...I remember singing this song in the choir at Christmas when I was a young child. Mariah sings with a whole lot of soul on this CD. I recommend this CD to anyone who hasn't yet bought it. It's a must for the holidays.
B000000W5L|3.0|When people think of The Rolling Stones, as another reviewer said you think of \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"Paint It Black\\", \\"Under My Thumb\\", \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", \\"Angie\\" and the likes of which are all well known and established classics. This album offers very little in terms of classics, \\"Shine A Light\\" is probably the closest this album comes to a radio classic Stones song. But like others have said... this album is not 4 singles and filler material, it's an ALBUM. Very rare to find but it relies not on singles and radio hits but it relies on the strength of the whole. <br /> <br />That being said, it isn't an amazing album as a whole though. It has peaks and troughs, with 18 songs that is bound to happen even \\"The Beatles\\" (aka The White Album) isn't 100% consistently awesome. But this album lacks a lot and seems very thrown together and not actually written. It feels like the band plugged in and jammed up the first 18 songs they could and in that 18 a handful are true  jewels in the crown. I'm sure there are other Stones albums worth getting over this one... \\"Some Girls\\" for one springs to mind.
1932907009|5.0|As a published author, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Save the Cat\\". Once you have read it, you will never watch another movie again without anticipating (mostly correctly) what needs to happen next to make the story enjoyable. I can't imagine anyone trying to write a book or a screenplay without reading \\"Save the Cat\\" first.
B000088E6D|5.0|I was at Barnes & Noble last night looking for a book and the music department was playing this. I don't own an iPod and I buy about 3 CDs all year. But I bought this one - total impulse shopping! As for Kurt and Paige who think the CD is pretentious, I think they are probably young and even if they aren't, they sound pretentious themselves. Wow! They have heard Frank sing the same songs! Any idea how many people have sung the songs Frank sang? Give it a rest! This guy has a smooth voice and yes, I have heard all the songs in the original form and many of them I heard when they were first on the charts. Nowadays, what group doesn't remake or cover a song? This guy's voice is smooth and he has made smooth versions of songs that you might like to listen to when you're in a more mellow mood. His version of Crazy Little Thing Called Love, for example, is a great song for a mellow or romantic evening. The original is NOT. My husband and I like to dance - you know how to dance? The cheek-to-cheek kind of dancing? Can't do that to many of these originals. Doesn't mean people who were around back in the \\"day\\" don't want to hear them again. Buy the album - yes the ALBUM - and grab your honey.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have watched over 10 times in the span of about 3 years and it never gets old.  I get engrossed in it just as much when I watch it now as I did when I watched it the first time.  To me, that is a pretty good indicator of a quality movie.  <br />Of note is Brad Pitt's acting.  I never gave him much credit before seeing this movie.  But a guy that can pull off something like Meet Joe Black (also good) and then turn around and flawlessly act the bit part of a gypsy boxer who revenges his murdered mother is not your typically pretty boy actor.
B000002LUB|4.0|Between the albums Tyr and Cross Purposes comes this brief reunion with one of the greatest metal singers of all time: Ronnie James Dio.  This is the album Dio tried (and failed) to reproduce with Angry Machines. <br /> <br />This album, as I suggested with the title, is the greatest work Dio released, including everything he did with Elf, Rainbow, Sabbath, and his solo effort.  This is his pinnacle.  Even Mob Rules cannot compare to the heaviness and depth of Dehumanizer, and it's the same lineup! <br /> <br />Iommi has matured over the ten or so years since Dio left (his playing gets more diverse and improved with every release, but I suppose after Paranoid it loses its novelty), and Dio's voice has never sounded better as he belts out lines like \\"What do you say to the dead?\\" and \\"I am the crazy man who lives inside your head\\". <br /> <br />If you've heard and enjoyed Heaven and Hell or Mob Rules or both and haven't heard this yet, it's time you did.  And if you want to get into Dio-era Sabbath, start either here (at the end) or at the beginning with Heaven and Hell.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Moronic and down right boring Keanu Reeves vehicle is an insult to your senses. The movie is shot way too dark in certain scenes of the film and the special effects are tepid at the very best. Keanu Reeves gives his all but regardless of his efforts, he's not right for the role. His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happing. Makes no sense but that's some of the inconstancies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now. That would have worked much better and been much more effective than the overblown special effects movie that it is now and probably would have been much scarier to boot. I would have rather paid to see that then this film right here.  <br />
B000002KE2|4.0|So Sabbath decided to \\"start\\" experimenting on this album.  This isn't entirely true: as the pioneers of heavy metal, Sabbath were experimenting with every release.  What people mean when they say that Sabbath were beginning to get more experimental is that they were moving on from what they started and creating something new with it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, with Vol. 4, what you get and what you see is something that don't come easily.  This is nowhere near the mark they hit with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  All the songs just sound like ones from Master of Reality with a little tiny bit of experimentation. <br /> <br />Such experimentation, unfortunately, includes the instrumental \\"FX\\".  The band made this album when they were completely high (they were in a hotel with a closet literally filled with cocaine), and this instrumental shows this.  I think you truly need to be high to enjoy this part of the album.  Otherwise, you'll do what I do, and just skip it.   <br /> <br />I like the way \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" begins, but then it dissolves into a song I can easily forget.  And it is definitely too long because it is no \\"War Pigs\\". <br /> <br />\\"Laguna Sunrise\\" is a good instrumental, but is overshadowed by \\"Fluff\\" off Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. <br /> <br />Those are the bad points.  However, the album does have its charm (or I wouldn't rate it 4 stars).  \\"Changes\\" is a good ballad.  Not as good as \\"Solitude\\", but a good ballad nonetheless.  \\"Supernaut\\" has one of my favorite riffs ever, and the nonsensical lyrics are brilliant.  The percussion solo is also pretty awesome.  \\"Snowblind\\"...if you haven't heard this song, buy this album.  Simply great stuff there.  I like the doomy intro to \\"Cornucopia\\" and the happy and heavy riff in \\"St. Vitus Dance\\". <br /> <br />But the highlight, the true redeeming feature of this album, the one that takes it from a high 3-star to a low 4-star rating is \\"Under The Sun/Every Day Comes And Goes\\".  Beginning with a great doom riff andending with an awesome solo foreshadowing Kirk Hammett of Metallica, this song contains everything Sabbath has to offer, including the punky \\"Every Day Comes And Goes\\" bit.  This is one of my all-time Sabbath favorites, and by itself is well worth the price of this album. <br /> <br />All-in-all, a more than decent album every metalhead should at least look into.
1932100385|5.0|May of 2004 I hit a crossroads in my life. I had serious health issues that needed to be addressed. I had heard about \\"Hallelujah Acres\\" and their way of eating 4 years earlier from a close friend whose husband was diagnosed with cancer. They embraced the \\"H.A.\\" way of eating and he recovered. I knew it was the right way to eat but I wasn't willing to \\"give up\\" my comfort foods at the time. I didn't hurt that bad. Four years later I had a decision to make. Were my taste buds & comfort foods in control of my health and life or was I? When my 20 year old daughter heard I was going to eat a vegan diet with 85% raw & 15% cooked (the H.A. Diet) she challenged me with a question. If there were people getting great health results eating 85% cooked vegan foods- what would happen if I ate 100% raw fruits, veggies, nuts, & seeds? I was horrified. Now, not only was I giving up meat, dairy, eggs- now she was adding all cooked items etc... I thought about it all night. In the morning- I had let go of my addiction to ALL cooked foods and began a journey of all the RAW fruits, veggies, nuts, & seeds I could eat! That was 13 months ago- 30 pounds ago (easiest loss ever), adult acne gone, monthly cramps gone after having them EVERY month for 32 years, and healing from other more serious issues. During this time I have been active- triathlons, 5K's, dancing with my husband. I would not have believed I could be this athletic and eat only fruits, veggies, nuts, & seeds. After researching PROTEIN and learning things like mother's breast milk is only 5% protein during such an important building of the body & that major athletes in America eat this way & I was getting my protein from the same sources cows were .... and now I was proof of the \\"protein\\" hipe being false... I look the best, feel the best, and am excited about turning 50 with  all this happening in my body! I had tried to be a vegetarian years before but now as I look back I can see my diet really wasn't vegetarian I had beena \\"bread-etarian\\". I have been looking for books to show me proof of \\"my living proof\\". I have found my way to have my lifetime goal : to be PILL FREE, PAIN FREE, and DISEASE FREE! The China Study- is just that! It is so exciting! You gotta read this! This is the HOPE I have been looking for! Don't put if off! READ IT! You will find truth!  [...][...]  [...]
B000002KFJ|4.0|Those of you who have heard Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die know Ozzy was not in top form on those albums.  However, most of you who are reading this have not heard them, as chances are you would buy this before those two. <br /> <br />\\"Hole In The Sky\\" is a decent opener, but nowhere nearly as classic as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"War Pigs\\", or \\"Sweet Leaf\\".  Also, I hate the way it ends, with the artistic but failing idea to interrupt the song with an average instrumental. <br /> <br />Oh well, after \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" the album gets much better.  \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" is a longer \\"Paranoid\\" with a surprise bridge.  Then you get the real treat of the album: \\"Megalomania\\".  When I heard the live version of this song on Past Lives, it literally sent chills down my spine.  I had not experienced that since I first heard the song on Sabotage. <br /> <br />\\"The Thrill Of It All\\" is an above average song that once again warns us of the evils of our society. <br /> <br />\\"Supertzar\\" is an awesome \\"instrumental\\" with a choir. <br /> <br />The album descends again with \\"Am I Going Insane?\\"  This song sounds like something Ozzy might have done during his solo years, and that fact just makes me cringe every time I hear it.  This isn't saying Ozzy's solo work is bad; it just doesn't fit with Iommi's style. <br /> <br />However, the album does pick up again with \\"The Writ\\", a song targeting the record industry directly.  An awesome epic of a song that is only shadowed by \\"Megalomania\\".  As it should be. <br /> <br />Every Sabbath fan should have a copy of this, even though I consider it the worst of the first six Sabbath albums other than Volume 4.  Read my review of Volume 4 if you want to know why.  But first, buy this.  It won't disappoint.
B0009EOZYO|3.0|As a hardcore DT fan, I am a bit confused over the band's direction, post \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" which I consider their seminal work.  Despite the hopes of progressive metal that may spring in fans' minds upon seeing the 24+ minute title track, this is no \\"Scenes.\\"  Nor is this the \\"return to metal albiet mainstream\\" direction of \\"Train of Thought.\\"  Frankly, two of the songs (\\"Walk\\" \\"Answer\\") are fairly simplistic, though well executed, ballads.  With other bands, these would be throw-away tracks but DT does execute things a bit better than most. <br /> <br />The opening song is very reminiscent of Pink Floyd (\\"Welcome to the Machine\\" \\"On The Run\\") and you will find other parts of this work to be, well, derivative.  That's not to say the music is bad - these are excellent musicians and they don't miss a beat.  However, the epic title cut is VERY reminiscent of Floyd's \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" in its opening.  Later, it strongly reminds one of early Genesis (\\"The Musical Box\\" in particular and other Gabriel-era tunes) and, for those who know the band, the stylings of \\"It Bites\\" (a very decent Australian progressive-pop band).  However, once (or if) you can get past this, it is a very good piece of music that is worth not only hearing but, for a musician, study. <br /> <br />Other tracks are very good and heavy (\\"Panic Attack\\" is one of my favorite) and despite the seemingly disparaging comments I've made, I would recommend it to DT fans.  You can expect the usual exceptional musicianship from the band - Petrucci screams a lot less on the guitar but what he does (and it's still a lot) he does well.  Rudess is heavily featured on keyboards and is extremely effective.  Myung is his usual awesome self on bass (awesome opening on \\"Panic\\" and in \\"Sacrificed\\") and Portnoy continues to be one of the few drummers actually interesting in and of himself.   <br /> <br />Production and the like are very well done and 5.1 encoding will make this work even more a pleasure.  Ifthis were another band I'd give the album a 4-star rating, but DT sets their own standard bar very high.
B000002KDO|4.0|The legendary mary jane-induced cough of Tony Iommi opening one of Sabbath's masterpieces, Master of Reality.  \\"Sweet Leaf\\" plods along at a slow guitar pace with a fast bass, and in its simple inevitablity carried with that doom metal riff, you can't help but feel your adrenaline build.  I almost want to take out my lighter every time I hear it. <br /> <br />Then there's \\"After Forever\\", another terrific song that I like to play for my Christian friends who think I'm Satanic for liking Sabbath. <br /> <br />\\"Embryo\\" is just a bridge between \\"After Forever\\" and \\"Children of the Grave\\", both modeled on the idea that humanity needs to change its ways.  For some reason, these three songs just seem to fit together for me...you have questions of life after death, then the embryo, then children...just seems like a cycle. <br /> <br />After this, there is another instrumental, \\"Orchid\\".  It's okay, but it's no \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" or \\"Fluff\\".  Again, it just seems like a bridge between \\"Children of the Grave and Lord of This World\\". <br /> <br />For some bizarre reason (probably the bluesy bass line), \\"Lord of This World\\" is my favorite song on the album.  Many would probably disagree with me, but I like it because the riff sounds less like something out of an 80s action flick (\\"Children of the Grave\\") (and yes, I know the album came out before the 80s, but I was born in 82, so leave me alone), it's a little less choppy than \\"After Forever\\" and \\"Sweet Leaf\\", and I like the lyrics better. <br /> <br />\\"Solitude\\" is a great ballad.  I like it better than \\"Changes\\" from Volume 4 (find it a bit too repetitive), and it showcases Ozzy's early talent as a singer.  Where did it all go? <br /> <br />Finally, \\"Into the Void\\".  If this weren't such a short album, I would have complained about this song being at the end.  It really does sound more like an opener than an ending, and maybe that's my biggest problem with this album: just when you're headbanging along and expecting more, it just ends.  Instead of brilliant fillers like \\"Paranoid\\", you have two short instrumentals, one of which is half a minute long. <br /> <br />Despite the length though, this is worth your money and your time if you are into metal and its roots.
076781326X|5.0|The only regret I have about this movie, is that it has an ending. It is one of the rare musicals that never palls on me, no matter how often I see it...and believe me, I have seen it many, many many times. Ron Moody & Jack Wild make for wonderfully lovable villains (though I am not sure that Dickens meant for Fagin to be at all loveable). The movie has a very un-Dickensian atmosphere of reasonable happiness, again, not completely in tune with the feel of the original book, but thankfully, the lack of the typical Dickens despair & poverty makes the movie version more watchable...particularly for kids. Mark Lester was well cast as a tender Oliver, Harry Secombe is an inspired Mr. Bumble and the supporting cast has done a marvellous job. All in all, a DVD to possess, and watch at least once a year.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|This movie dissapointed me alot.  First off, who is Paul Greengrass?  I mean, if Liman would have directed this film it would have been a way better flick.  Second, if anyone has read the book, you would have realized how awesome the plot was and how this would have been a blockbuster if it would have followed it.  In the book, Bourne's own government kidnapps his wife and Bourne must kill an assasin in search of his wife.  This is all set in the Far East.  Now that is a good plot.  Instead, Bourne's wife is killed within ten minutes of the movie and it just falls apart after that.  Ludlum would be rolling in his grave if he found out.  I really think this would have been a decent film if it was set in China or Hong Kong and it followed the book more.  Anyways whoever directs the Bourne Ultimatum should follow the novel.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I've had this cd for a while now.  I listened to it all the way through and really liked it but it wasn't something that was in my cd player 24/7.  Here recently, I put it in and started listening to it again and then realized that it is much better than what I thought at first, which as I said before, was really good.  I noticed that these guys are not like any other metal band.  They are in a league of their own.  The musical talent presented here is nothing less than amazing...very technical.  One of the first things that came to my attention was the drums, being that I've been a drummer for years.  Chris Adler is fantastic and no one can deny that...it's a fact and anyone that says otherwise is full of it.  The guitars are right up there with him, I guess it runs in the family being that the guitarist and him are brothers.  The thing that I struggled with was the vocals.  Randy Blythe is very throaty, but after a while his voice really grows on you.  Listen to track #8.  He's very diverse and delivers some gut-wrenching screams.  I just can't say enough about this album.  If you're into extreme metal at all, check this out.  I don't think that you'll be disapointed.  If at first you don't like it, give it another listen.  In addition to this check out some of my other favorite bands: shadows fall, killswitch engage, in flames, lamb of god, all that remains, god forbid, unearth, and chimaira.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|Sorry people, the whole \\"Metalcore\\" genre is a Ministry \\"The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste\\" circa 1989 rip-off. Tweak the sound of the instruments, add more vocal distortion, add a dose of Metallica, it's all production technique. <br />I give A7X credit for trying something new for them. Of course it's not completely original, what is? Their originality lies in not giving two craps that those stuck in the \\"Metalcore\\" rut wouldn't like the new release. <br />P.S. - 3 Inches of Blood?? Talk about Helloween robbery. It's okay to listen to, but they're not the end all. <br />
0780020685|5.0|This is a masterpiece. Often imitated but never surpassed. In this day and age it is refreshing to see such a great movie without it being a great movie because of special affects. Toshiru Mifune at his best.
B00004YRQA|5.0|ok first of all i think these are too expensive. if i was smart i would buy the 2 pack and save money but i keep forgetting. ive never had any problems with these. so... yeah, there ya go. buy these if you have a ps2 but buy the 2 pack and save some money.
B0007GAERG|1.0|This album sucks. Nothing good is on here. Only good track is \\"It's Like That\\". If you like this album you're crazy. I'm sorry, I like Mariah Carey, but this album sux, really sux. Her vocals squeal all the time, I don't count that as singing. And her beats, WTF JD? Sorry, M. I luv yha, but PLEASE make a good album. <br /> <br />Oh, if you click no because you disagree, that's 100% unfair. Your supposed to click those if you think the review is helpful, NOT TO VOTE IF YOU DISAGREE WITH MY RATING!!! Just one thing, because a lot of one-star and two-star helpful reviews recieve poor ratings 4 no good reazon.
0553582461|5.0|This review is more 4.5 stars than 5, because as some previous reviews have mentioned, there are some minute flaws and the trilogy doesn't feel quite as cohesive as the Farseer trilogy. If I'm going to have to round to a full star, though, I'm going to round up because the saga that spans both trilogies is so fantastic. <br /> <br />The character development that powered the Fitz trilogies -- The Farseer and The Tawny Man -- does not slack. In fact, Fitz undergoes more changes than in any book since the first trilogy. Many supporting characters (specifically Chade, Nettle and Thick) are fleshed out much more thoroughly than one would expect. Owing to his progressively larger role in the Tawny Man books, Chade especially emerges as a truly three-dimensional character. The only character that dissapointed me slightly was Kettricken. What do we learn about her in this trilogy? That she's calm, strong-willed and queenly? That she loved Verity? She always seemed like a character on the verge of breaking out and having a larger role, and it just never happened.  <br /> <br />The emotional impact, while not as pointedly strong as that in Assasin's Quest, is still subtly powerful. The tension is created largely through Fitz's secrets. Realistically, this doesn't lead to a dramatic confrontation but rather the secrets unravel as Fitz grows closer to the other characters. Hobb is a master at manipulating tension, and she doesn't let it stop for very long. When one tension-building device resolves itself, another crops up. As a result, the pages keep turning. Very quickly. Don't be surprised if you read this book in a few sittings, even at 912 pages. <br /> <br />In the end, it's all about Fitz, and he does not let down. Fitz's struggles are painfully human and down-to-earth, which is quite a statement considering the volume of magic and dragons here (which is much greater than anywhere else in the saga). For those who haven't read the other books yet, you should know that youwill form a powerful attachment to Fitz. He is a deeper protagonist by far than any other I've ever encountered in fantasy. In fact, the only one I think of that comes close is Simon from Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy. The third-person narrative and branching, multi-POV stories that's so common in fantasy is eschewed for an intimacy that's just astounding. As I sit here, having finished both trilogies, I feel like I've known Fitz personally. <br /> <br />Overall, from a purely objective perspecrive, the Tawny Man books are slightly inferior to the Farseer books. The story is not as tight and there are more points where it meanders. Subjectively, though, I'd say that this is balanced out by the joy of getting to know all the characters that much better. Read them both if you haven't. You'll realize just how wildly underappreciated Robin Hobb is.
B0007P3582|1.0|This has got to be the worst rap album in history. He doesn't express any feelings whatsoever. I mean, it's fine that he's talking about goodies, but at least do it with emotion. This album should only be for ghetto flags. Because only a flag in the grass living in the ghetto would buy such a crappy album.    Go get an Eamon, Akon, or Eminem album. Spend your money elsewhere!    LAST WORD: This sux.
0060931736|5.0|Recently saw the movie The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in which Maggie Smith won an Oscar. She was great and so was the movie. So I took a chance on the book.<br /><br />The movie is very faithful to the book, but the point of view is different in each. While the movie is presented from Jean Brodie's point of view, the book gets more into the feelings of one of Miss Brodie's girls, Sandy Stranger. This change in perspective really helps the story because you see it from the point of view of a growing teenager whose perspective deepens and changes with age. Thus the shift that happens in Sandy from blind follower to rebellious foe, is much easier to understand in the book than in the movie.<br /><br />If you liked the movie, or if you are, like me, a fan of 1930's fiction, I think you will find this a rewarding book.
B00006FDCJ|1.0|This is nothing but another Western. Anyone expecting some brilliance or originality to be in sync with its Oscar win as Best Pic of 1992 will be sorely disappointed. Starts out with a gratuitously violent slashing of a prostitute and goes downhill in unpleasantness from there. I think I can guess why the Hollywood left-libs loved this enough to make it best pic: it portrays the West (read \\"America\\") as unheroic and simply violent and evil. That's the sort of garbage that the creeps in Hollywood lap up like cats to a saucer of milk. Hey, celebrities!! If America sucks, kindly return all of that money you get from us for working a few weeks a year, will ya? My feelings won't be hurt.
6304884419|5.0|It is a good film about the Bronx, about Little Italy in New York, race relations in the 60s and many other things, indeed. Yet the film seems to be a country revisited several times. The new element is the point of view that is adopted here, that of a kid who is growing from 8 to 17 and is the witness of the law of the neighborhood and how this law is imposed by some group of self appointed people who impose security and guarantee it then. In this case it is an Italian boss, and on the other side it is the Blacks, and no detail is given. What makes this film interesting is how the son sees the world and how he comes to accepting this or that idea, from his father or the local neighborhood boss. We see his personality growing, his independence blooming, at times without knowing it, his reason and moderation expanding at times against his own feelings and convictions. You add girls to that and then accidents on the road of social peace and you may have some real drama in which you discover the real value of this man, or even your father, who did not hate this or that or anyone in particular but rather tried, at times awkwardly to protect you. There are a few funny elements here and there, more dramatic elements now and then, but a lot of pathos all the time. Entertaining with good actors who are very well directed.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
0316168815|5.0|While the subject of this book turned me off before I even cracked it open, after the first few pages I was loving it. Although I thought the topic would be hard to read about, the character, her view on the world around her, and the story that takes us through the yeas was so captivating. And, although some people I've talked to didn't like the ending, I loved it. How often can you read a book that takes on this topic and end up smiling at the end?
1593072937|5.0|I wouldn't want to meet a guy like Marv in a dark alley or well-lit room for that matter.  However his story, the first in this series, has a very special place in my heart.  This is not your average noir story of sex, blood, and vengeance; a great deal lies beneath the surface.   <br /> <br />Marv is a thug with a body of rock, nerves of steel, and a heart of gold.  He spends his days boozing, brawling, and \\"taking care\\" of anyone who dares harm or even insult his friends.  After breaking the jaw of yet another twerp who got in his way, Marv is suddenly approached by a gorgeous woman who takes him up to a room for a long night of passionate sex.  Marv is in shock.  He can't believe that a woman like Goldie could see anything in an ugly thug like him.  The next morning, she is dead by his side.  Marv swears to avenge her death, no matter the cost.  As his investigation progresses it comes to light that Goldie was only using him as bodyguard.  Marv doesn't care.  That fateful night, Marv felt more alive than he ever had in his entire life.  For the first time, he felt wanted, desired, perhaps even loved.  When he woke up, all of those feelings were suddenly taken away from him.   <br /> <br />If you grew up with the opposite sex not giving you the time of day then you might know what it's like to all of a sudden find out that someone is into you.  You feel shocked with disbelief and dizzy with anticipation.  It totally knocks you sideways.  If you remember that, chances are you also remember what it feels like when that scenario comes to an abrupt end.   <br /> <br />This is what has happened to our man Marv and to make matters worse, he has been framed for it.  Despite all this, he feels rejuvenated now that he has a mission, an obligation, and a purpose.  Those responsible for the death of Goldie will pay and pay dearly.   <br /> <br />I'm a fan of Miller's work, and film noir as well.  However, there is more to this story than just being a crime drama or a revengestory.  It's a sad tale about a dangerous and dysfunctional, yet lonely man who got a brief taste of happiness before it was cruelly taken away from him.  Now, he's on a mission, a mission that will surely kill him.  He knows this, and he doesn't care. <br /> <br />When you finish the story and go to the fridge for a cold one, grab another for Marv too.

This a MUST have for anyone with a toddler.A wonderful way for children to learn their colors.

B00005V9HH|1.0|I heard people rave about this movie, so when I popped it in and watched, it, I was surprised to find out how superficial and weak it was. There is nothing really special about this movie, other than maybe the performance by Kevin Spacey. But even that has been done before, and I can't remember anything really good or memorable about this film, other than the plot. But there is a difference between plot depth and real good plots, and smoke and mirrors.

0679721037|5.0|John Hersey has written an incredible book about a world changing event.  Hersey tells the story of Hiroshima and the aftermath of what happens.  Instead of telling the entire story minute-by-minute, Hersey focuses on six people living very different lives on the day of the atomic bomb blast.  He puts a human face to the story of the devastation of a civilian city. <br /> <br />Hersey's brilliance is not that the book is well written, it is, the brilliance is that he focuses on the six people and tells about what every surviving japanese citizen endured after the blast.  Hersey never gives detailed accounts, but hints at the terrible pain and injuries each person recieved, which makes the entire episode more horrifying.  Hersey also spends a great deal of time explaining the ambivilance of the Hiroshima citizens toward the idea of the bomb.  Many of course were angry, but many more had a \\"it can't be helped\\" attitude.  Hersey explains that Hiroshima was both and economic and transportation crossroads.   He also explains that the Japanese government followed a \\"total war\\" philosophy and this was the price.  Hersey does not condone nor criticize the dropping of the bomb. <br /> <br />This is an execellent book and should be read by everybody.  The end of the book is updated during the eighties to tell the final outcome of the six people.  Each has a story that both resembles each other and yet are very different in each of their own way.  For me the most surreal moment of the book was when one of the six end up on \\"This is Your Life\\" and meets the pilot of the Enola Gay.  Excellent read.  Highley Recommended.
0385483821|5.0|<br /> <br />This is not just another business book <br /> <br />\\"Foresight is not a gift--it's learned.  You must see the future in your head first before doing it\\" <br /> <br />The author is giving us clarity, writing another page in the instruction book of life--we have no manuals to guide us through it at the outset.  Other reviewers are missing the point here, it's not only regarding business, but as one reviewer saw it--sound and practical advice.  And if you follow a simple paradigm of rules in life and set goals with continued awareness your purpose here will be solidified.  My discernment reading other reviews is typical of academic intelligence and the breeding of what to think and not how to think.  Our whole life is a business, and people like Andy Grove are very unselfish, adducing as evidence tools to cultivate continually our growth.  Andy is apostolic providing such humanistic qualities that can quickly shift the constellation of power in all of us.  The only thing that holds any of us down from growing is our lack of candor to life's recipes with our constancy of pessimism.  Any person that wants to understand the purpose here and relationships in their life--whatever they are, should read this other brilliant passage that we didn't receive at birth.  These are the kinds of books that need to be read. It provides you with an understanding that acquiescing in our mistakes is the acumen necessary to be successful in life, and that the impetus for growth is found in our volitions. This opens up another window, and this freshet of wisdom will stretch your mind and brighten your outlook--a necessary, acknowledging, and absolutely uplifting read.
B000001EL3|5.0|This is an incredible CD by an incredible band. Almost every song on here is good. <br /> <br />Detroit Rock City - 10/10 - Amazing. Classic. Excellent song that'll get everyone up and out of their seats. <br /> <br />King of the Night Time World - 10/10 - Awesome song about being bored and wanting to have fun with night life! <br /> <br />God of Thunder - 3/10 - I don't really care for this song. Some people like it, though. It's slow, deep, and dark. <br /> <br />Great Expectations - 7/10 - Doesn't really sound like Kiss on this song, but it's good nontheless. <br /> <br />Flaming Youth - 10/10 - Awesome song that'll have you tapping your foot the whole way through. <br /> <br />Sweet Pain - 10/10 - Gene Simmons at his best. This is a really fun song. <br /> <br />Shout It Out Loud - 10/10 - Great Party song that will have you shouting out lous the whole way through. <br /> <br />Beth - 8/10 - Slow song, but good. One of Kiss's best ballods. <br /> <br />Do You Love Me? - 9/10 - Very catchy song that'll get stuck in your head easily.  <br /> <br />Overall, this album for me would get a 10/10 just because of Detroit Rock City. The other songs support the album nicely, though. Definately one of Kiss's best. This was out in 1976, and just to let you know, is a completely different sound than Kiss's 1982 heavy metal album, \\"Creatures of the Night\\", which is also an excellent CD you'll want to pick up. \\"Destroyer\\" is definately on the best albums out by Kiss. If you like awesome music, than this is for you.
B00009MGR6|4.0|The great thing about AC/DC is that you know exactly what you're getting when you buy it. Their formula is simple, crunchy riffs, insane solos from Angus, Brian (or Scott) throwing their throats out, sing a long choruses, and a bottom end that kicks your (...).<br /><br />Blow up Your Video is no different. Sure some songs are better than others, and there are better AC/DC albums than this (Back in Black, Highway to Hell), but the formula is still there. AC/DC always stuck to their guns. When a lot of our favorite bands have gone out into la la land and released really bizarre stuff, AC/DC were there to keep us anchored. They may never have an Unplugged Session on MTV or release a 'concept' album, but I don't think AC/DC fans want them too. When it comes to rock n roll, AC/DC are meat and potatoes and there ain't nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />Favorite tunes on this album: Heatseeker, That's the way I wanna Rock n Roll, Meanstreak, Some Sin for Nuthin, and Go Zone.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I loved this movie the first time i saw it, which was after i bought it, unlike the Blade movies which added a new spin onto Vampires this movie also adds a spin to werewolves- looking into other supernatural beings, givingthe film more depth to it. I was glad that the film didn't over empathise the feelings between Selene and Scott, it would have totally ruined the movie and turned it into a cheap horror/romance flick when it was so much more than that.I do agree that a bit more of the lore of the Werewolf and Vampire link coulfd be explained, but on those occasions when it was delved into it was focusing more on the personal history - adding substance to the plot. But the link was explained, you just have to listen! Besides in the Sequel no doubt more of the past will be explained, hopefully more about Selene and Scott as their own histories are only ever hinted at, never fully explained to us, except maybe Selene but i digress, keping them in mystery. i cant wait for the Sequel as i found this movie fantastic with it's skew on the supernatural, i thoroughly recommend it to anybody who likes films that take a new spin on sometimes cliched ideas.
1592400876|4.0|I feel like an expert in the apostrophe, having been a product <br />of Catholic schools during the late fifties.  Even into my high <br />school years in the early sixties, punctuation was continued to <br />be taught.  I am a punctuation freak and cannot even send an <br />e-mail without including correct apostrophes, commas, and  <br />capital letters.  As you can see, I am a proponent of the <br />Oxford comma (using commas in a series).  Lynne Truss amused <br />me with her strict adherence to the rules and her chagrin at <br />those who falter. I admire her intentions.  However, I'm afraid <br />that her audience will probably be those who already know how  <br />to use punctuation properly.   <br />   I look back on all the students in Southwest Detroit that I <br />tried to teach punctuation...singular possessive and plural <br />possessive.  If you are listing items in a series, use a comma <br />after each item except the last.  I can bet you that none of my <br />little gang-bangers remember any rules of punctuation. <br />   While this was not a punctuation lesson, I was trying to <br />teach the use of double negatives.  \\"Ok, class, I don't have <br />no money.  If I don't have NO money, I must have SOME money.\\" <br />Confused looks met me from all my students.  \\"Ms. Kirsch, if <br />you ain't got NO money, then you ain't got NO money.  How can <br />you SOME money?\\"  Lord, help me! <br />   I guess I enjoyed the book from my own standards of reading. <br />However, I've looked over my text here and wondered if it would <br />have met Lynne's standards. <br />
B0007ORU66|5.0|I don't have this album, but I've heard every song on it. It's a good bunch of songs, too. Personal favorites like I Should Have Known Better, Can't Buy Me Love, Paperback Writer, Revolution, Lady Madonna, Don't Let Me Down and Ballad of John and Yoko. Hey Jude (the song) is, for the most part, good, but wears thin after four minutes of what my dad calls, \\"kum-bai-ya's\\". Thankfully, using the incredible iTunes, I cut a good three minutes of \\"kum-bai-ya's\\" and made the perfect version of Hey Jude.<br /><br />This comp is, generally, only for collectors. Why? Everything but I Should Have Known Better and Rain are either on the Red Album or the Blue Album, and I Should Have Known Better is on a Hard Day's Night. But for all you collectors, I think this is the only place you can find Rain. (Unless it's on Past Masters).<br /><br />If this is, like my dad says, a greatest hits collection from that period, why isn't Get Back on Hey Jude? That would make sense, seeing it's the a-side to the Get Back/Don't Let Me Down single and a #1.
0765301598|2.0|Simply put, there are too many plot lines in this trilogy that don't make sense.  For example, what is the purpose of Hecate?  She comes back to fight for the humans, only to have her brain fried by a human (in a misunderstanding).  Worse, not only does Hecate get fried, by The Sorceress, Venkee, and Noret all get killed at the same time.  For what?  What is the point?  Frankly, it seems like the author was planning to jump ahead in time in book three and needed to quickly resolve the lives of many characters.  That is likely why Xavier, Serena, and Ginjo all get smoked at about the same time as well. <br /> <br />Also, what about how Omnius uses the technology of Gedei Prime to launch those probes in to space?  They were never mentioned again, but the purpose was to create new sychronized words far out in the galaxy.  What ever happened to that plot line?  Also, why couldn't the machines figure it out themselves?  Why did they need human technology.  The whole thing seems silly. <br /> <br />Another source of annoyance was the authors apparent insistance on approaching these books from the perspective of moral relativism.  The thinking machines keep humans as slaves, but so do the humans.  Gee... the humans are no better than the machines.  In case you don't get the point yourself, the author takes numerous opportunities in each book to beat it in to you.   <br /> <br />Oh, and lets not forget the outrageously stupid military blunder that dooms the thinking machines.  Omnius pulls practically ALL machines away from every planet and collects them all at Corrin.  Then Omius launches them toward Salusa, leaving the entire sychronized empire wide open to attack for a period of months.  Given, Omnius apparently did not know about the human's space folding technology, but come on!!!  Are you kidding me? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|1.0|The only reason i gave it 1 star was because of the visual vibrance of color. This movie is complete trash, it had no story whatsoever. It was too long and too boring. This movie is more for the guys because there is so much female nudity, i as a female, do not care if a film has nudity, but this film as unneccisary nudity. The lack of a plot really made this movie make me want to leave the theater, i could not wait until it was over. it is very comic book style, because the action, and blood bath scenes look so fake and ridiculous. Certain actors like Elijah Wood, do not fit the role they were cast in. in all, the acting, no plot and no story, and the unneccisary nudity makes this film an utter piece of mindless trash.
B0000041DF|5.0|This is musicianship first rate. Yes, it is wild. Yes, she misses quite some notes. Yes, I know, the orchestra has trouble keeping up. But the result is such a vital recording, full of energy and creativity.  <br />Both concertos have been recorded hundreds of times. However, once you have listened to this cd, you feel that all other recordings lack this abundance of energy and you return to this cd.  <br />Simply amazing. Buy this cd. <br />
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This movie is not for the typical mainstream movie goer, its dark, and requires thought to fully understand and appreciate how good this film is. i will admit this, Keanu Reeves does kinda speak like Batman, but hey it works. Great acting, great story, great visuals, only complaint is that one action scene in particular has John Constantine on the street fighting a demon composed  of insects, the demon look too computer graphic, so fake. other than that its great. for all you romantics, sorry this movie doesnt even have 1 kiss in it at all. another reason i liked it. If i were to give this movie a rating it would be PG-13 because the only thing in it is a little bit of language, so id say its safe for the family to watch unless children are afraid of the demons, who arent scary and arent intended to be who seldon appear.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Back in vogue after being shunned and even banned at the time of its release, Freaks is a daring look into the lives of unusual circus performers in an era 75 years lost and gone.  Having been made in 1932, you won't be seeing any special effects or phenomenal feats, but what you will see is the best collection of freak show performers Hollywood could gather at the time.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple.  Beautiful trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) toys with midget Hans (Harry Earles) until she discovers that Hans has a great deal of money.  The gold-digging Cleopatra, together with boyfriend/strongman Hercules (Henry Victor) plots to capture Hans' little heart and steal him away from fianc&eacute; Frieda (Daisy Earles).<br /><br />Cleopatra achieves her goal, capturing the sweet and gullible Hans into marriage, but at their wedding feast among the circus' more peculiar acts, Cleopatra becomes drunk and her malicious nature explodes.  The freaks, alerted to Cleopatra's snaky underbelly, ally themselves with Hans who has mysteriously fallen ill.<br /><br />Coming to Hans' aid, the circus freaks corner Cleopatra in her schemes, catching her red-handed with poison in her hand, and chase her out into a bitter rainstorm to her doom.<br /><br />Let's face it, the real attraction to Freaks is the abnormal conformation of the human actors involved.  Prince Randian, the Living Torso; Daisy and Violet Hilton, the Siamese Twins; Johnny Eck, the half-man; Frances O'Connor and Martha Morris, the armless girls; Peter Robinson, the Human Skeleton; Elvira and Jenny Lee Snow, the microcephalics, or \\"Pinheads\\"; Elizabeth Green, the Bird Girl, and of course Schlitze, the happy-go-lucky \\"pinhead\\" who lived until 80 years of age in real life.<br /><br />Not being professional actors, these performances are slightly wooden, but the group works so well together that you should be able to overlook the amateur acting.  For what little Browning had to work with in regards to sets, the scenery and background was carried out quite well.  The photography is not top quality, even for 1932, but overall the film is more \\"good\\" than it is \\"bad\\".  I feel that it is an important film, especially to anyone who enjoys modern day horror.  Freaks, after all, was the birth of abnormality in horror, bringing in the human condition rather than werewolves and vampires.<br /><br />Once you have watched the movie, turn to the Special Features.  I do not usually tout special features on DVD's, but the ones with Freaks are must see.<br /><br />First is the Special Message Prologue, that should have played before the movie also.  Next, the movie with commentary by author David Skal.  Third is the best feature, called Freaks: The Sideshow Cinema.  This is an interview type commentary with author David Skal, Sideshow Performer/Historian/Author Todd Robbins, Sideshow Performer/Historian Johnny Meah, Actor and Little Person Mark Povinelli, and Actor and Little Person Jerry Maren.  This special feature is as entertaining as the movie itself, and is a \\"not to be missed\\" feature.  It includes segments revealing the private lives of some of the sideshow actors involved in the film.<br /><br />As a side note, during one of the still shots, take a look at the size of that 1930's movie camera.  It's the size of a compact car...almost!<br /><br />Freaks is a DVD that every horror aficionado should own, and watch more than once.  The subtleties of horror are all there in their embryonic stages, made available by presenting real flesh rather than skin bondo.  And yet, these people were portrayed as happy individuals, living a communal lifestyle inside the warm comfort of each other.  A real community, not remotely like Hillary Clinton's \\"grasping at election straws\\" communities.<br /><br />Lots to study in this piece, but lots to enjoy also.  Pop some old fashioned popcorn in oil on your gas stove, get yourself a coke and put some maraschino cherries in it, then sit back andenjoy this long lost treasure.  Enjoy!hen sit back and enjoy this long lost treasure.  Enjoy!  <br />
B0000028P8|5.0|The MTV UNPLUGGED series was a great idea to put singers in a simpler live acoustic environment stars such as Nirvana, Paul Mc Cartney and of course Mariah Carey.    <br /> <br />By the time 1992 came along Mariah Carey was a superstar with millions in the bank and fans the world over thanks to that stunning voice and 2 classic albums the self titled MARIAH CAREY (released in 1990) and EMOTIONS (released in 1991).  But this however did not seem to be enough to win the acceptance of many critics who seemed to like to knock Mariah down because they had never really seen her perform in concert just the odd song on TV shows.  <br /> <br />Mariah had always been to shy to perform lots of songs to an audience so this gave some people the impression that she was a studio girl who didn't really have the voice. But in March 1992 this all changed when she preformed on MTV UNPLUGGED and simply blew the audience away that night and shut the critics up in the process and in June that year it was released on CD and the cover of the Jackson 5's ILL BE THERE was also released as a single becoming Mariah's 6th number one single.   <br /> <br />All the songs are preformed very well and in a slightly different style to those on the previous albums and her backup singers such as the Price sisters and Trey Lorenz (whom duets with her on the incredible ill be there) are on top form. <br /> <br />In all this is a quite short (it only has 7 tracks) but amazing CD (I mean come-on its Mariah Carey live!! ^_^).          <br />
B00006AW2M|4.0|Quite possibly the most maligned album in their career, 'Satanic Majesties' has definitely been better appreciated over the last thirty-eight years then when it was first released in December 1967. Still, there is more than one track on here that smacks of psychedlic overindulgence. '67 was a very trying year for the Stones as most fans know. Jagger, Richards and Jones all faced drug charges (Jagger's was absurd, has anybody been been busted for dramamine????)which were later quashed after a scathing editorial in the London Times, but the future did look pretty bleak. Experimentation continued and the year long acid trip which was started by January's 'Between the Buttons' was further explored by the \\"We Love You\\" single and the 'SMR' at the conclusion of a very trying year. As for the lp itself, several songs deserve honorable mention: classics such as \\"She's a Rainbow\\", \\"2000 Light Years from Home\\", \\"Citadel\\" (love that booming guitar sound!), \\"2000 Man\\" (a true lost classic, later covered by KISS) and \\"The Lantern\\". A misstep? Probably and the inevitable 'Sgt. Pepper' comparisons may be warranted but this has to be recognized as a band under trying times trying to stretch out their sound. The Stones were able to bounce back from the lackluster response for this album and for the next five to six years would create a body of work that would not only restore their supergroup status but could be considered one of the greatest runs of brilliance in the history of rock music. As for 'Satanic Majesties', \\"and my kids(critics? fans?) they just don't understand me at all.\\"
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Australian band Jet is the hottest rock band on the rise.     Get Born is a straight out rock record with some heavy riffed gems like the extremely catchy Are You Gonna Be My Girl?, Rollover DJ, Get What You Need, the Stones influenced Get Me Outta Here, and the Who influenced Last Chance. Jet also offer some low key stunners: the Oasis-esque hit single ballad Look What You've Done, and the amazing Move On.    Get Born can become Jet's own Definitely Maybe (Oasis's debut hit album). The follow up to this album, if they perfect it,  will surely cement them as major players in the rock 'n roll scene.    This is definitely an awesome album!    Recommended    B+
B00000J048|5.0|I just bought a used version of this same toy, and my 2-1/2 year old daughter loves it!  She connects the blocks together to make \\"train tracks\\", sticks the gears into the blocks and spins them with her fingers, and even enjoys figuring out how to fit everything back in the plastic box we use to store it in.  I'm sure this is a toy that will grow with her, as she begins to build more complex gear systems.   <br /> <br />I love that it allows her to be creative, and the toy itself is pretty to look at, too.  The blocks are also flexible enough for small fingers.  I'm so happy with it that I'm considering buying another set (at full price) so she'll be able to build even bigger gear structures.  An all-around great toy!
0671027344|4.0|I've been waiting for a book to come along this good. I really enjoyed it! Nomatter who you are, I think you will be able to relate to the main character somehow! :) I really could not put it down - I read it in a day!
B0002234LS|3.0|After Johnny Depp shot to Mainstream movie stardom as swashbuckler Captain Jack Sparrow, he starred in the suspense thriller \\"Secret Window\\" it was good movie, but some things were hard to figure out if they were really happening, like writing \\"shooter\\" many different times,  going insane attacking his wife and did Johnny kill all the people and his dog and not even know it, because the stalker is not real. Mabye I have to see it again, well and it is a Steven King novel, his books are confusing or so I've heard. give this a try and see what johnny does for you in this more and more confusing thriller. <br />\\"what do you want from me\\"
B0007GAERG|5.0|I strongly recommend that you make this album apart you're CD collection. Mariah Carey has more musical talent than anyone I have ever seen.  She shows off her unbelievable 8-octave range in \\"Circles,\\"  \\"I Wish You Knew,\\" & \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\"  Not many artists can make as big of a come-back as Mimi did.  By releasing this album, she basically said that she was going to be around for many years to come.  I now have to put The Emanicapion of Mimi up into my top 3 favorite albums of hers, next to Music Box and Daydream.  \\"It's Like That\\" is a very hip-hop-like song that is one of my favorites.  \\"We Belong Together\\" is without question, the best on the album.  At the time of this writing, she has spent 7 non-consecutive weeks at the top of the CD-Single charts, and hopefully, with this album she will jump ahead of all of her others. Mimi's last 4 Cd's; Glitter, The Greatest Hits, Charmbracelet, and The Remixes havn't been very successful, but she jumped back into it and with The Emancipaion being out for nearly 5 months already, it has been certified multi-platinum.  Congratulaions Mariah!  This album is strongly recommended along with Butterfly, Daydream, Music Box, and Mariah Carey.
B000050HTO|5.0|This is the first album by Bob Dylan that I've ever owned.  My friend is a huge Bob Dylan fan and recently got me into his music.  Seeing him in concert was an amazing and unforgettable experience.  I would say that it's a good compilation for a new/casual fan of his music.  It's amazing that he still carries on, with a career that has spanned several decades he is a true american music legend.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|I was listening to this again and just had to put in my $.02. I liked it a lot when I first heard it, and it just keeps growing on me. While \\"Nocturama\\" has been gathering dust, I don't think this one will any time soon. Glorious, thundering, joyous, ominous, inspired, funny, beautiful. I most often hear it on an iPod and headphones at work, but every time I hear it there, I can't wait to get home and hear it on a decent stero. It has a wonderful thundering sound and feel that you won't hear in an MP3/AAC/etc. I hope I hear some of live sometime.... It sounds different than a lot of earlier Cave (as much Cave does), but it's among his best work.
B0002KVUL6|4.0|I can call this a full CG movie. It was great. Visuals and CGs were not as brilliant as Lord of the Rings trilogy but very good indeed for a passable entertaining movie. Everything was allright except Count Dracula. In behind the scenes featurettes on disc two I found out Stephen Sommers and his crew's adorable and hard effort of making this movie and make it a good and memorable one. but the question is, why beyond all of that efforts, they ruined most of their job's impression by casting a wrong person as dracula? and funny is, in \\"Dracula featurette\\" on disc two they mentioned some brilliant nominees as Jeoffery Rush for this role! Just imagine if Jeoffery Rush had played in this movie as Dracula, How memorable this movie could've been? I could give this movie 5 stars if they'd used someone else instead of that clown!  Hugh Jackman and kate Beckinsale were the best matches for their rules. A good complex I can say! In CG and visuals, they did a great and really monumental job. but their consequence have not enough impression! some CGs are very sophisticated and look like real and some like Mr Hyde, Frankenstein Monster and Dracula monster at the end of movie are awful. I think they've used too much imagination thet they shouldn't!   anyway It's a \\"must have\\" DVD set for a CG movie collection or even an action movie collection. Special features are really good and useful in the Ultimate Collector's Edition. I've not seen such accurate featurettes on making a movie in any DVD set except Lord of the Rings Trilogy extended editions! but the price of this set is irrationally high! Approx 50 dollars for a 2 disc set? I don't know why. me myself have Asian Import of the Ultimate Collector's edition which is even better than US version. It has a great outer box. A double DVD case plus two Dual-layer dvds with a marvelous print that I've never seen in any US made DVD! All artworks are included plus a great real DTS audio track! It doesn't seem bootleg with all of that great features and I bought it 8.00 dollars! With all the respect, I think it's time for some US producers to reconsider their prices cause US release DVDs are not unique in quality anymore!
B000002W3R|3.0|This is Elvis' the last album. Released two months before he died. It is a colage of live and studio recordings.<br />The only songs that are not covers are Way Down, Moody Blue (composition of Mark James who wrote Suspicious Minds) and It's Easy For You (Andrew Lloyd Webber an Tim Rice' composition). Unchained Melody is a boring cover of Righteous Brothers (on That's The Way It Is he covered their You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling), Little Darlin' is a cover of classic doo wop song, He'll Have To Go was a hit for Jim Reeves, If You Love Me and Let Me Be There are John Rostill's compositions and were hits for Olivia Newton-John (?),... The only two songs that are really great are George Jones' She Thinks I Still Care and Johnny Ace's Pledging My Love.<br />If you are not The King's fan don't buy this album!
055321263X|4.0|I read this book for the first time after seeing Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical version of it in London.  I loved the musical, and I liked the book, which fills in many \\"holes\\" that the musical couldn't address.  This is a great mystery/romance novel.  The only reason it gets 4 stars from me, rather than 5, is the language--typical of its time--wordy, flowery, and a bit hard to follow in places.  Someone born in 1860 wouldn't have a problem with it!  These days (probably unfortunately), we're tuned to short chapters and short paragraphs.  However, sometimes its nice just to curl up with a book like this one and stretch the brain.  Dig in!
B0009KA7BS|4.0|....And by that, I mean this horrible two and half star rating the movie got here on Amazon. <br />I see nothing at all wrong with the acting in this film.  In fact, Keanu did better here then he did in the last two Matrix movies(which isnt saying much I know, but come on)  The story was entertaining, CGI was great, and I had a fun time watching it.  To me that makes a good movie.  Who cares how close it got, or didnt get to the graphic novel.  You just need to take the movie in by itself, forget there is a comic book and you wont have any problems. <br />Dont listen to these sub par movie critics, the movie is a enjoyable watch.  Hope they dont make a sequel to this movie, dont need to have the Matrix fiasco happen all over again.
B000002H6C|5.0|For quite a long time, Metallica's \\"Master Of Puppets\\" was my absolute favorite metal album. I believed that nothing could possibly top it. That all changed when a friend first lent me \\"...And Justice For All\\" two years ago. <br /> <br />The opener, \\"Blackened\\", simply blew me away, and the pace kept going with the title track and \\"Eye Of The Beholder\\". Up until that point, I had been thinking that it was pretty great, but not quite \\"Master Of Puppets\\" caliber. And then I reached \\"One\\". <br /> <br />What can I say? It's my favorite Metallica song, and to this day, one of my top five favorite metal songs, period. It begins as a beautiful ballad, then slowly builds up into one of the most crushing thrash songs that the world has ever seen. If you ever need to describe thrash metal to someone through one song, that song is \\"One\\". <br /> <br />The next three songs are also great thrash, and definitely not worth skipping. But then we reach (IMHO) the greatest metal instrumental ever, \\"To Live Is To Die\\". This stirring tribute to Cliff Burton, Metallica's former bassist, is emotional, epic, and heavy all at once. <br /> <br />So after all this awesome metal, I was thinking, \\"How can the last song live up to all of this? There is no better Metallica closer than 'Damage Inc.', and i'm not sure that even that song is worthy.\\" But \\"Dyers Eve\\" is definitely worthy. This is another one of my favorite Metallica songs, and it's a great way to end this majestic album. <br /> <br />So my recommendation? Buy it now. Whether you're a fan of old or new Metallica, \\"...And Justice For All\\" will not disappoint.
B000002J09|5.0|I'm a musicmaniac, my cd's collection it's to close to 500 units(may be low for your country, but not in Mxico), the half of it CLASSICAL and other ROCK music, may be strange but it is, and one of my favourite albums all time is this, Led Zeppelin IV, and was the first CD that I bought, I had not a player CD still. I have all albums without remasters (one of the first editions) , and Boxed sets of them, including out-of-print, \\"The complete recordings\\" (I have two editions of each album in total). Then, I'm a hardcore fan of Zep, and when I listen this album after some large time, this drives me an mistycal enviroment, etereal and atmospherical scope. It's one of the few discs that I put one and other time again. And for me it's the BEST ROCK BAND OF ALL TIME tied with PINK FLOYD.    Combining the visceral power and intensity of hard rock with the finesse and delicacy of British folk music, Led Zeppelin redefined rock in the Seventies and for all time. They were as influential in that decade as the Beatles were in the prior one. Their impact extends to classic and alternative rockers alike. Then and now, Led Zeppelin looms larger than life on the rock landscape as a band for the ages with an almost mystical power to evoke primal passions. The combination of Jimmy Page's powerful, layered guitar work, Robert Plant's keening, upper-timbre vocals, John Paul Jones' melodic bass playing and keyboard work, and John Bonham's thunderous drumming made for a band whose alchemy proved enchanting and irresistible. \\"The motto of the group is definitely, `Ever onward,'\\" Page said in 1977, perfectly summing up Led Zeppelin's forward-thinking philosophy.    At the dawn of the new millennium, Led Zeppelin placed second only to the Beatles in terms of record sales, having sold 84 million units.     Led Zeppelin IV IS THE FOURTH BEST-SELLING ALBUM IN HISTORY, having sold more than 22 MILLI0N COPIES, and FOUR OTHER ALBUMS by the band - Physical Graffiti, Led Zeppelin II, Houses of theHoly and Led Zeppelin - also rank among the all-time top 100 best-sellers. Fittingly, Led Zeppelin is tied with the Beatles (five apiece) for the most albums on that esteemed list - a mark of both bands' impact. In their ceaseless determination to move music forward, Led Zeppelin carved out an indelible place in rock history.     There is not doubt, Led Zeppelin isn't only a great ROCK BAND, is one of the most influencial style of music, and philosophy into the lifes of several generations. THEIR INDUCTION IN ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME IN 1995 IS NOT A CASUALITY, it's only a recognize of the scope of their exceptional work. LED ZEPPELIN is a Living Loving Leyend.
1400032717|5.0|I have had more discussions about perspective in the 5 days following this book than I would've thought possible. This is the type of book that helps the reader put things into perspective. The  book is from the point-of-view of an autistic boy, which gives the reader an opportunity to step away from the adult point-of-view and put things into perspective. Whether your interest lies in the autistic mind or in stepping outside to view the world from someone else's shoes, the book will definitely speak to you. I was affected greatly by this book and the message it sent.<br /><br />In one of my conversations following this book, I told someone that an ordinary event occurred in the book, and the child saw it one way, while the parent saw it another way. \\"Talk about missing the point!\\"<br /><br />The person with whom I was speaking asked, \\"You or him?\\"<br /><br />\\"Exactly,\\" I said.
B000002O51|3.0|NOTICE: If you do not have this record, do not buy it without finishing reading this review.    THIRD STAGE is not near as good a record as the band's previous two (DON'T LOOK BACK and BOSTON). The main reason for this is more than likely that the band is gone. Brad Delp (mainly lead and harmony vocals) and Tom Scholtz (mainly guitar) were the only band members left at that point, leaving Boston in a dark spot; Tom Scholtz covered most of the music (shining a light on his almost overly-apparent talent), but he overdid it - far too many overdubs (even for Boston) were added, and more than 80% of the record's drums are recreated through keyboards (drum simulators, if you may). There is hardly any natural sound; the acoustic twelve-string guitars are essential to the album. Without them, this album would be blow-dried, air-conditioned claustrophobia wrapped into a disc.    THIRD STAGE gets an rounded 3 stars from me, the result of disappointment and a reverse effect: certain things can 'grow on you' over time, but this seemed to 'grow off me' over time. It might seem great when you buy it, but that will change.    DO NOT EXPECT THE BOSTON FROM THE 70'S - YOUR EXPECTATIONS WILL FAIL YOU!
6305263248|4.0|Ronin, simply, is a great guy flick.  Lots of action.  Kind of plays out like a good western.  Robert De Niro, Jean Reno are excellent as two of the hired guns of the mysterious Deidre played by Natascha McElhone.  There are twists and turns.  Good guys, bad guys, but who is who?  John Frankenheimer created an Action Packed buffet of shoot em' ups and chase em downs. <br /> <br />Finally, this film has the best car chase scenes you will ever view.   Not the corny, computer enhanced garbage, that one sees now a days, but real car chases!  If you liked The French Connection and Bullit, you will love Ronin.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Let me make it clear here and now that I hate Britney Spears with a flaming passion. So yes, this is very biased. In fact, I wouldn't even call it a review, but more of a warning. <br /> <br />This \\"woman\\" is a very bad influence on kids, especially young girls. I'm 16 and it absolutely and utterly disgusts me that this person who is supposed to be a good role model is singing to my 9 year old sister about her sex drive. <br />Then my sister proceeds to walk around the house singing it. <br /> <br />Back in the day, this would've been considered pornography. Now I'm all for being a progressive society, but this isn't progressive. This is regression in it's purest form. I feel that Britney Spears is hurting the image of women that feminists have been fighting so hard to build. She's perpetuating the idea that women are nothing more than sex objects, and that is a very bad thing. Did I mention that I'm male? So don't write me off as just another crazed feminist. It's just things like this make me worry about the future. <br />If you care about these things, then you won't support Britney Spears or any of her pop-princess clones. If you took the time to actually read through my rantings and ravings, thank you. If you came away from it learning nothing... ugh. :)
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Having now watched the film a number of times and having read numerous and varied reviews, I have a few things that I would like to say. <br /> <br />First, I thought the film was beautiful. While I have been known to be a Broadway \\"snob\\", this film won me over with its visual expression, endearing acting, and frankly fabulous vocals. <br /> <br />Second, to those of you who did not enjoy the film, you have the right to that opinion. However, please do the rest of the world a favor and express that opinion in such a way that we can understand it. To be specific, please learn to spell and to write in complete sentences so that we can understand what you are trying to say. You obviously feel strongly or you wouldn't be writing a review. Your voice deserves to be heard - which won't happen if we can't understand your review. <br /> <br />Thirdly, to those of you who dismiss the film out of hand simply because it is not the Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman stage show that you are so obsessed with, I'm frankly sorry for you. This movie ISN'T the stage musical. It doesn't claim to be. In fact, the filmmakers made a point of changing a number of elements so as to distinguish the movie completely from the stage musical. Perhaps you could try appreciating it for itself and not as an imitation of your beloved musical. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy the movie once you look at it as a separate entity. <br /> <br />Finally, I would like to reiterate that I found this movie to be a lovely, well-told story. Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson brought fresh life to characters that have long been staples of the musical world. The supporting cast was strong, and the set design and cinematography were incredible. All in all, a stellar production.
B00006879E|5.0|Anyone who listens to this CD is sure to swoon at the sound of Adam Levine's sweet and sexy voice when he sings his seductive lyrics about the mysterious Jane. The reason that the songs are such a success is that they come from true experience. One of the sexiest songs on the CD is \\"Secret\\", with lyrics like, \\"I know I don't know you, but I want you so bad. Everyone has a secret, but oh can they keep it? Oh, no they can't.\\"  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend purchasing this CD for an instant mood lift and to just kick back and listen to the smooth voices and lyrics of Maroon 5.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I have been an Eagles fan for only 10 yrs, late bloomer.  I saw this concert in Jersey.  I bought the DVD and I felt like I was at the concert again.  The Eagles are endless.  Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed.
B000002H97|5.0|metallica are simply the best metal band in the world of the last 20 years.why?co's they keep reinventing themselfes on every album, like they did on this one.other bands come make a hit and than desapear,but metallica has been around for 25 years.they sold millions of albums whithout having a song, played on tv or in the radio.period:this album showed the world what the metal fans already knew they are the best!some say this is a more comercial album,i dont think so,it has got some of the heavy songs metallica ever made like 'sad but true'or the 'strungle whithin'.also got 5 number 1 chart songs:'enter sandman''sad but true''the unforgiven''nothing else matters'and 'wherever i may roam'.the millions of people that have this album cannot be rong:BUY IT!
6305718954|5.0|I am an ex-Christian and found this movie to be one of the most thought provoking about the faith I've seen. After seeing movies about Jesus-based religion, I become very cynical and talk about everything that's wrong with the faith. However, this movie was the first I've seen where I came out not hating my religious past. It made me think about the true intentions of Jesus and wonder how much of the faith had been altered by power-hungry people and doctrine. It made me want to research the history and the thoughts. This movie didn't make me believe, but it made me appreciate people who do.
B000002KIK|4.0|First of all, I was reading most of these reviews. Out of the people that gave it a bad review.Most of them just bought it without first previewing it. Did you ever hear of previewing the album before you but it. If you knew that Black Sabbath was on lots of drugs and that the album before this one was not so good, in your opinion. Why buy it without aleast listening to some some of the tracks. <br />         It's not their best but it's not that horrible to throw in the trash. Plus it's better than most of today's junk. <br />       Never Say die 10/10:It dosen't sound like their earlier stuff but it still rocks! <br />             Johnny Blade 8/10: It's pretty good and if your into the keybords you'll love this one. <br />             Junior's Eyes 10/10: This has to be one of Sabbath's underrated songs. It's very emotional. <br />             A hard road 8/10: Sounds alittle to poppy for me but that might just be me. <br />             Shock wave 10/10: Another underrated Sabbath song and is one of the \\"heavier\\" tracks on this album. <br />             Air Dance 10/10 : Another great track and is my favorite track. <br />             Over to you: It's the last song on a Black Sabbath studio album you would hear Ozzy's voice. Very good lyrically and musically. <br />             Breakout 9/10: No lyrics but the music is snappy and very different for Sabbath. But I still like anyway. <br />              Swinging the chain 8/10: Another track sung by Bill Ward which he also wrote. <br />
B0008ISM40|4.0|Yes, the DVD side of this album also has DVD-A as well as an AC-3 surround track in the DVD-V portion.  This isn't mentioned in Amazon's technical details (Dual Disc doesn't require DVD-A), so if you are looking for this excellent album on DVD-A, this is it. <br /> <br />The CD side is a bit of false advertising in my opinion.  While Dual Disc claims only a \\"limited number\\" of CD players won't play the CD side of a Dual Disc, this includes my main 2 channel system's Sony C555ES CD/SACD player and most of my computers (which have recent DVD/CD-ROM drives).  No playback on my 2 channel system.  So it look like I have to get both this for the DVD-A and the CD version for my other systems, contrary to the goal of what a Dual Disc is supposed to offer. <br /> <br />Don't buy this expecting it to play in your CD player.
1400082773|3.0|Please, don't get me wrong, I loved this book.  Obama's style and matter-of-fact realism is both refreshing and, at times, inspiring.  The only reason why this book isn't 4+ stars, is because of the expectations that this book leads the reader to believe.  <br /> <br />What I mean is that by reading the summary and back cover, the reader expects to experience a man torn between two cultures and belonging to neither.  And while Obama does clearly illustrate his trepidation with associating himself with either culture, from the very beginning we learn that Obama, for all intents and purposes, held his black heritage in a different regard.  He was not torn so much as distraught, growing up in a 'white' world unfamiliar with his black background.  From reading this book, the reader does not get the sense of Obama'a sturggle with his white roots.  The story is rather a search for answers on how to live as a black man in a white world.  I believe that Obama missed the chance of opening the doors to a wholely different and misunerstood world of children of differing cultures.  In this 'melting pot' that we call America, there is a constant struggle between race and ethnicity and Obama could have set himself up as an educator, a leader of those who had no home.  Yet, from the beginning, Obama was at home in his black heritage, but he just was looking for the key.
B00003CXA6|5.0|As much as I enjoy this movie, I enjoyed it that much more when I saw the extended play version of the movie on Turner Classic Movies this past weekend (9 July 2005). Does anyone know if this version (dvd, extended play (17 extra minutes), widescreen) available commercially?
0684800713|4.0|This novel is Hemingway's earliest. It contrasts starkly with his last novel with only two human characters and one animal protagonist/antagonist (The Old Man and The Sea). It narrates the story of aimless young men and women touring France and Spain. The narrator is the observer of his friends destinies. All are in love with a flirtatious girl, but the most unlikely one (the narrator) wins in the end. This novel is beautiful for its picturesque descriptions of countryside and bull-fighting.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I find the vocals in \\"Svefn g englar\\" annoying. Otherwise this is a great CD. I don't know how anyone can compare them to progressive rockers like ELP or Yes, though. Sigur Ros is minimalistic.  <br /> <br />Simple songs with a handful of notes per song. Progressive rockers are the opposite and write as if it were a competition to see how many notes they can fit into a song. <br /> <br />This is more like Eno's ambient music. Spacy, minimalistic. Maybe they sing about elves, but they are nothing like ELP or Yes.
B0002X314C|4.0|We got ourselves a winner in John Legend.  John Stephens (before he was dubbed a Legend) is at the top of the R&B game right now.  He was in the background for awhile, popping up on songs by Dilated Peoples, Alicia Keys, and his main man Kanyizzle (Kanye West).  With promotional tours and opening shows for people, Legend gave us a little anticipation with his album.  That is rare these days when debut artists just pop up and have an album a few weeks later that the labels seriously think somebody's gonna buy (Brooke Valentine, Ricky Fante, Nivea, and so on).  John Legend proved to the listeners that he deserves your attention...and did it rather eloquently.  The always-humble Legend dropped an album the whole FAMILY can enjoy.  There are jive turkey songs like \\"Alright\\" and \\"She Don't Have To Know,\\" fun songs like \\"Used To Love You\\" and \\"Let's Get Lifted\\" and thought-provoking songs like \\"Ordinary People\\"  But the best songs on the album have to be the emotion-driven \\"So High\\" and \\"Live It Up,\\" the theme song for weekends and vacations.  The only detraction is the Snoop Dogg collabo \\"I Can Change\\" which should have been saved for a standout single for a soundtrack.  But even with that minor blip on the radar, John Legend is flying high in the clouds with an astonishing debut album.
B000088E6P|1.0|The first rap album I got was Get rich or die tryin. At first I felt that this was one of the best rap albums out , but as I expanded my horizons I found 50 much less appealing. More and more I found his lyrics negative and violent. I believe that 50 cent is the stereotype of rap music. All he speaks about is money, cash, hoes, guns, and beefs. And the scary thing is that this is the rap that most kids are listening to. If I were a father I would rater have my kids listen to artists like Comon Sense or Talib Kweli instead of this bull. You know were he got his name. He got it from this NY coke dealer who ruled the city by fear. He thinks he deserves to be called 50 because he took some shots. He only got shot because he, as a poser overstepped his bounds. 50 cent? He's only worth  a penny.
074322454X|5.0|This is the best Ambrose book I have read. After I watched the mini series of Band of Brothers i picked up the book and in no time could not take my eyes off the pages.    The book is about a company of soldiers from training to V-E day in WWII. It's written where theres not too much time spent on any event. Unfortunatly, Winters and Webster are the main focus so you don't get to learn about most of the other guys. But if you want to, watch the mini series where they have a lot more character development.
B000669GAI|4.0|I have heard most of the songs off the original albums, and alot of the remastering done to these songs is worth the extra price. The mastering really affects the sound of the early songs for instance songs off Ten are pumped up to the point to were you can hear things you couldn't on the original mixes for these songs. I also noticed the stereo range for each song has been widened, and it sounds totally different so much that I don't regret getting this 2 disc set. The mixing guy did take out some cool relay echo effects on the vocals, and a few noisy guitar sounds but that still doesn't damage them to the point of not giving them a listen. I got into this band rather quick seeing as they are better than Nirvana in terms of lyrics. Eddie Vedder makes sense in everything he says, and not to mention he tells some great twisted stories in some songs. Im a fan of grunge and i guess you could call this grunge hell some people call it alternative idk i would say it's grunge and damn good music to put to your ears. All I have to say is save the money don't buy all the albums unless your a huge fan of this band. If your the type of person that is very picky about sound quality or you were a fan from day one get this.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The Usual Suspects is a very unusual movie. It's about a man (Spacey) talking to a cop about a robbery he and is dead followers committed. Spacey talks about all the things that happened leading up to the robbery and how it happened. Its kind of hard to explain and if I say much about it that ruins the movie but u have to see it. Great plot, great acting, great everything.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I, Robot is an impressive sci-fi action/drama that hit the silver screen in 2004.  Its stunning visual medium as well as superb plot line make this one of last year's better and most unique movies.  The acting is skeptical now and then, but it is the NS-5 robot star and eerie, almost haunting push-of-notice for today's technological roboticism that make I, Robot truly in a class all its own.
630512762X|5.0|Face Off is a great movie. Its about a man who's trying to take down a terrorits group so he takes the face of one of the terrorits captured (Cage). But Cage's character somehow gets the face of the man who took his (Travolta), and nothing is the same from there. The good guy is in a prisoner and the bad guy is among the good people, living with the guys face he has family, ect. The ending action scence is terrific and the movie is awesome.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was introduced to Firefly a few episodes after it originally began airing, by a friend of mine who intially tried to sell it to me as \\"a new show by Joss Whedon.\\" \\"Who?\\" I replied -- I'd never seen an episode of Buffy or Angel in my life, although I knew that a lot of people liked them. After a bit more explanation, I decided to watch the next week. <br /> <br />The first episode I saw intrigued me. By the end of the next one, I was hooked. And then, of course, the show was cancelled a few weeks later. <br /> <br />When the DVDs were finally released, I think I watched them 3 times all the way through over that following week -- once for me, a second time to show one of my roommates who was curious after having wandered through during my first runthrough, and a third time to show my sister and one of my other roommates who had both come in in the middle of the second runthrough. (Both of the roommates ended up borrowing my set to show their families, who I believe later bought the DVDs for themselves.) <br /> <br />As for the show itself? Amazing. I haven't seen enough TV to call it the best show ever, but it's certainly my favorite, and from what I've seen, it's extremely rare that shows deliver as well and as consistently as these 14 episodes do. Effects, score, lighting, costumes, sets, acting, story, and characterization are all top-notch. <br /> <br />The extras are also well-done and demonstrate the obvious love that the cast and crew have for the show. The commentaries are full of information (such as that one of my few caveats with the show -- that at the end of some of the episodes, everything's wrapped up a bit too neatly and happily -- was actually Fox's insistence), as well as stories from the set and lots of joking around. <br /> <br />Go see Serenity in September. It's really, really good. And you'll be able to enjoy it whether or not you've seen Firefly. <br /> <br />But if you'd like to get to know the characters a bit better beforehand, or if you'd just like to watch 15 hours of great television, check out Firefly. <br />If you want to see it before taking the plunge, it'll be airing on SciFi Channel on Fridays at 7 Eastern starting July 22. You might also check your local library or video store. <br />Now's a good time to buy the DVDs though since their price has dropped somewhere between 5 and 10 dollars from what it was before. <br />Enjoy the show, curse its premature ending, and have fun on September 30th at the movie!
037571457X|5.0|I heard about this book through a friend of mine who went to a book signing by Marjane Satrapi in town recently. The book mainly deals with the author's childhood years going in Iran shortly before, during and right after the Revolution. It was interesting to see how she developed her progressive views from her Communist parents and other relatives like her grandmother and uncle who defied the restrictive Iranian government. The book is also impressive because you get a first hand view of what it was really like to be a woman in that society. I think I learned more about the Iranian Revolution, or at least an alternative view, from reading this book than from all those years in school. If you are looking for a pro-American/pro-Western Iranian point of view, you are likely not to find much of it in this book, as it talks a lot about negatively about Western policies towards Iran's oil industry and Western involvement in Iraq. The drawings are amazing. I felt like Satrapi's life vividly came to life to me and told her story more clearly to me, which made to book even better.
B000002KDS|5.0|This is probably alice's best album ever, bought it in 1971 and by 1972 it was literaly worn out, Halo of flies sticks in my head more than the others,this is after all the godfather of shock rock,. often imitated , never duplicated ...BUY IT.<br /><br />  47 year old kid
0375422889|5.0|This book picks up where Persepolis left off, when Marji's parents send her to Vienna to escape the traditionalist Iranian regime. This sequel is equally as impressive. This deals more with how others, in this case Europeans, identify her as \\"other.\\" Marji always felt like an \\"outsider\\" or a \\"Third-Worlder\\" as she had a hard time relating sometimes to her white friends. From being a homeless drug addict for a brief time to finding out one her first loves was gay to becoming an aerobics teacher, Marji definitely goes through more things in her short time than most people do in a lifetime. I was thoroughly impressed with the author's storytelling abilities, which were sad, thought-provoking and comical, which made it hard for me to even put down the book. It was really great to read a book about a Iranian feminist who lives her life the way she wants to live it. I was impressed by this book because the Western media gives the impression that all Muslim women are helpless, when in fact as one read this book, Muslim women are empowered and taking control of their lives.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Being an Earth Wind,& Fire fan and a Chicago fan from the late 70's, I would have brought this DVD site unseen, that's how much I'm in to these two bands.  Upon seeing it, it is by far worth every penny spent. Placing these two bands on the same stage is speechless along with magic in the making.  From start to finish the energy is non-stop.  From the standpoint of a musician, to watch the two bands execute the chord progressions and tight horn licks with such ease as we mere musicians sit and spend hours trying to figure them is a music lesson you can't put a price tag on.  In the category of pure entertainment, how's this, my 10 & 16 year old daughters (both drummers) along with some of their friends have watched this DVD more times than I, it's that good.   <br />For those of you who say Philip Bailey has lost his touch, Lord knows I can't wait to see the show where he regains it, his voice range in this concert is out of this world.   I don't want to say Chicago vs E,W,& F because the two bands have their own style.  Chicago may have been a little stiff but again the harmony and the solos were like vintage wine.  When they come together for 25-6-4, two powerful horn sections, two bass players, two drummers, top this mix with three guitar players going at it, you figure it out. <br /> This one gets 5 stars from me.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I always had mixed feelings about the 1971 version with gene Wilder; the first 30-45 minutes were so depressing.  Fortunately, this movie is a vast improvement.  The scenes before the entry into the factory were much better, showing the sad life of Charlie without being so morose.  The new version does a better job showing the nastiness of the four other children, and better tells what fates the four nasty children had.  Also, while I ocassionally amused at points with the 1971 version, I was constantly chuckling throughout this movie.  Also, I liked how they replace the 1971's subplot of \\"Slugworth\\" and instead replaced it by giving Wonka more depth by showing what led him to become the world's greatest candy maker.  I was afraid about the ending, but what I originally thought was the ending wasn't and instead I got an ending even more satisfying the the 1971's version.  The only fault in the 205 version is the fact that most of the Oompa-Loompa songs are unintelligible.<br /><br />Parents take note: while the 2005 version isn't particularly horrifying, the squirrel scene might frighten small children and anyone who is afraid of rodents had best leave for the bathroom during the scene.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|This movie has good battle sequences and good plot but lacks historical accuracy and acting. I think that they shouldn't try and get \\"hearthrobs\\" for the leading role. I didnt like that they put brad pitt as achilles. They should put a no name character so no one is thinking throughout the movie that its brad pitt instead of achilles. You cant capture the whole movie with him playing that role. Also, the war seemed like it lasted 10 days rather than 10 years, which is not historically accurate. All in all, I liked this movie, but it could've been better.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Great special effects movie, but no story. Personally, I prefer more of the psychological vampire type stories, where the vampire gets into the head of his victims before attacking, but this is still an ok flick.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|yes, we know how good they are at guitar and we know that they are latino.  if only they haddnt abandoned the brilliant song structes they created with ATDI and the overall fluidity that they once possesed, this album might be credible.  if you want to hear wailing guitars, get a stevie ray vauhn album, and if you want to hear progresive music, listen to Yes.  if you want to beleive that the mars volta are doing something new and extremely impressive, get stoned and lsiten to their album while sniffing rails off of the cd cover.  otherwise, its just an albums worth of guitar masterbation and fake words.
0694013889|5.0|Yes, the book is a bit old-fashioned with the potty being an actual \\"pot\\", but it is geared toward honest and frank explainations of a child's body parts and their functions. It sure made the whole process easier when my two daughters were able to grasp the concept of where \\"poo poo\\" comes from and where it should go. Sure it's got a picture of a little girl pointing to her bottom, but unlike some of the other reviewers, I feel no need to be prudish about it--after all isn't it better for your child to be fully informed about their bodies and it's functions?
B0009X4VXK|5.0|I loved old rock en espanol, and if you do also you will love this cd.  I specially loved NO and ESCONDITE INGLES.  It's a different vibe for shakira from her last CD but thats the whole point, right? why the same again?! Buy it is great.
B0000666DW|4.0|It's always great to be surprised by an album that you did not have great expectations for. This album is certainly one of those for me and started me on the road to becoming a big fan of Mastodon.<br /><br />  I say \\"started\\" because I really became a big fan the first time when I saw them live. These guys clearly enjoy what they do and have a sound that is instantly indentifiable as \\"Mastodon.\\"  Remission is full of technical and tasteful tracks with the drumming in particular standing out. The lyrics are somewhat cryptic, (in a good way), and seem to subscribe to the less is more theory of lyric writing. The album is very heavy as a whole, with even the slower atmospheric instrumental track \\"ole' nessie\\" coming off as nicely chunky as well. On the whole it's really hard for me to directly spot their influences as a band even though I certainly hear parts of some tracks that do remind me of other metal bands ( two of the members spent time in Today is the Day so some of that is there ). I had Heard the Lifesblood EP before this  and while I liked it at the time it really only hinted at what they were capable of.<br /><br />  I highly encourage any metal fan who wants something that sounds fresh is pretty technical and thoughtfully put together to pick this album up.

B00008WT5M|5.0|I think out of the brian johnson era it is their third best(BACK IN BLACKis their first out of every era,FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK second best)And this one,it was their comeback into the top 5 charts.Best tracks are RAZORS EDGE,MONEYTALKS,THUNDERSTRUCK,SHOT OF LOVE,ARE YOU READY,LETS MAKE IT,and GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD LUCK.Get this album......its a must have,and after you listen to it....you'll be..........THUNDERSTRUCK!!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|What a stunning debut, and now an essential rock classic!  A must have!  No bad tracks here!
B00005JKGK|3.0|Overall, I like this movie. I've seen it a couple of times, and it's a heart-tugger.  <br /> <br />As a second-generation Asian American, I could definitely relate to issues of trying to reconcile having parents of a previous generation and growing up \\"westernized\\" in the States.  It can be difficult to strike a balance when Asian and western cultures and values appear to be so different. So I thought the movie portrayed this dynamic very well. <br /> <br />However, the movie's portrayal of gender relations between Asian men and women is awful. It's just way too one-sided and gives no depth to the characters of the Asian men. The movie characterizes Andrew McCarthy's character - a white guy - as the only \\"good\\" guy, while the only good Asian character is the father who plays the more stereotypical Asian grandfather type. If anything, this movie just reinforces stereotypes of Asian men - not only with roles they play in movies, but sadly as they relate to gender relations.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|This release moved the band in the direction of epic/solid songwriting which has stood the test of time well, making it a joy to listen to.  It isn't saddled with a timestamp (i.e. 80's music) - it's just good!
B0009IW98O|5.0|I will gladly buy this album right away since I've been trying to find the studio version of \\"Heavy Music\\" for quite some time.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|I will be the first to admit that I don't really like romantic comedies all that much.  They tug at our heart strings, make us sick to our stomachs, and leave us dripping in sacharine sweetness.  LOVE ACTUALLY is no exception to the mix.  In fact, this film seems to be a romantic comedy on steroids, combining the Hollywood happiness of several movies into a single extravaganza.  Throughout the film, we are treated to many interweaving storylines of love.<br /><br />Although I found the film to be a bit too sweet for my tooth, I did enjoy watching the storylines overlap one another and I was entertained.  Despite the film's length, I found myself interested in a couple of the storylines in particular..like that  of Billy Mack, a cynical rock star who steals every scene he is in.<br /><br />LOVE ACTUALLY is neither a great film nor a terrible one.  It is an average film.  No more, no less.  Not worth a buy...but perhaps a look.
B000002HPT|1.0|I own and love very much every other dream theater album (except octavarium, i didn't like it that much) and let me tell you this album disappoints me, bores me, and depresses me to the extreme. <br />don't buy it unless you like slow boring repetitive FILLER junk.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Almost everyone remembers \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" fondly.  It so effortlessly captured that sense of childlike innocence and wonder of seeing an impossible dream come to pass.  And if \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" doesn't quite reach that same level of wonderment, it is still a strange and wonderful ride, led by the always visually incomparable Tim Burton and his favorite foil Johnny Depp.  The film focuses, of course, on Willy Wonka (Depp) a brilliant but reclusive candy maker searching for an heir through an elaborate contest.  Five lucky children will discover a golden ticket hidden with their wonka bars, meaning they will tour Wonka's magical factory, not knowing that Wonka's sugary empire will be bequeathed to one of them. Most moviegoers will know the story by heart, but Burton, Depp and screenwriter John August put such a fresh spin on the tale that audiences will not mind seeing the old, familiar faces another time. <br />  <br />One of those faces has always served as the crutch of the story: the well-meaning and earnest Charlie Bucket (a superb Freddie Highmore).  He is not strong or fast or tall, but he has a good heart, formed by the loving relationship with his family.  Much of the film's heart is found in the terrific rapport that Charlie has with his family, that include Helena Bonham Carter as his soft-spoken mother, Noah Taylor as his hard-working father, David Morris as the cantankerous Grandpa George and David Kelley as the feisty but big-hearted Grandpa Joe.   The early scenes featuring Charlie and his family are the best of the whole film, giving plenty of hearty laughs and strong  characters.  They all eagerly watch as four of Wonka's golden tickets are found by selfish and undeserving children before they joyously witness Charlie get his hands on the last one by sheer luck. <br />  <br />Soon Charlie and his grandfather head to Wonka's factory with the other winners and tour the amazing and impeccably concieved ChocolateFactory.  Alex McDowells' colorful production design and Phillipe Rousselot's vivid cinematography are wonders unto themselves.  But more importantly it's here that we get our first good look at Depp as Wonka.  His performance is a radical departure from Gene Wilder's original portrayal.  Depp's Wonka is self-exile from society due to problems with his dentist daddy (Christopher Lee) disowning him for being a choclatier.  Depp's performance works a little too well at first.  He's distant from the gaggle touring his factory but he's also a a little removed from the audience, who are bound to be caught off-guard by his overtly weird turn as Wonka.  But give Depp and Burton time.  The character grows and starts to emerge from his shell as the movie goes along, aided by great moments of off-kilter humor and Burton's extraordinary visuals, leading to a sweetly satisfying conclusion that never comes off syrupy.
0785787135|5.0|I thought this book was wonderfully written, and MZB truly captures the essence of her characters.  It is so fascinating to read about a time when Christianity was not yet dominant, and the process by which it came to be so. The thing that most endeared me to the novel was the way in which Avalon was brought so vividly and beautifully to life in my mind and heart. The book made me believe that somewhere out there, Avalon still exists, a place full of magic and mystery, untouched by the hand of time.  It is both an inspirational story and a melancholy one; highlighting triumph and failure alike.   <br /> <br />The book certainly divulges from the mainstream of \\"accepted\\" Arthurian legend, but the turns that it takes are believable and well thought-out.  If you are looking for a story of the infallible goodness and bravery of Arthur and his knights, this book is probably not for you, since more times than not, the men appear weak and vulnerable, easy prey for the women that control them.  However, if you are looking for a new perspective, the women are written not as the evil downfall of men, but as real people with feelings, motives, strength, and sorrow.  I found it very refreshing. <br /> <br />My least favorite aspect of the book was that Merlin was written as two characters, the first being more of a traditional Merlin figure named Taliesin, and after he dies, his successor Kevin is a deformed man with no loyalty to Avalon.  Merlin is, to me, one of the pinnacle figures of Arthurian legend, a wise and benign mentor to Arthur, and I did not enjoy him being sidelined and weakened in this way.
0553582461|5.0|The ending of the Tawny Man trilogy wraps up in a very bittersweet package.  Thanks to the unsolvable problem of the Fool being a man and him a man, his very close relationship with the Fool is doomed to end like it does.  Fitz doesn't have anything but strict heterosexual urges, and seems to struggle with how to deal with that when he loves the Fool so much.  That part of the story is a very good - about an impossible relationship. <br /> <br />Like the previous trilogy, the story is a character-driven story.  It's about the characters during the journey.  The ostensible main story is very good, but it is really just a vehicle for telling a great story about some very memorable characters. <br /> <br />This makes the trilogy the most re-readable thing I've read since Raymond Feist & Janny Wurt's Empire trilogy, relegating the Empire books to #2 on my list. <br /> <br />This is the 2nd time I've read the Tawny Man, and the 3rd time I've read the Farseer trilogy.  They keep getting better with each re-read, despite the wish that I could smack Fitz up along side the head sometimes; for his stubborn inability to trust people and keeping secrets always brings him grief.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|I was disappointed when I finished watching Sahara. When I heard the book was being made into a movie, I was excited. Who wouldn't, Dirk Pitt on the silver screen a second time in a better vehicle. I am a Cliver Cussler fan and I was severely disappointed. Dirk obsessed with a Civil War Ironclad? Rudy portrayed as a bumbling stooge? No Abraham Lincoln or mention of Kitty Mannock, who's plane Dirk and Al make into a sail racer? It's like Raise the Titanic, half the book, missing the other half. And to the producers, Dirk was a Major in the US Air Force before Sandecker recruited him for NUMA, not the US Navy, get it right. Now I really don't blame Cussler if he decides not to have any more of his books turned into movies.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I love the orignal Batman and Batman Forever but Batman Begins is better.  This movie is really the first real attempt to make batman work in the real world.  Unlike all the others there are not countless leigons of henchmen following a insane leader for no apparant reason.  They make Batman a more ninja like character that uses darkness and stealth as well as working with others fears as weapons.  Just a awsome movie
B000980GRU|4.0|Will Smith is a cute, funny, and charismatic actor who has charm to spare. It is, therefore, surprising that Hollywood has never before cast him as the lead in a  romantic comedy. I doubt that this oversight will occur again, as Mr. Smith takes to the genre like a duck takes to water and makes it his own. His seemingly effortless, laidback style of acting strikes pay dirt as the romantic lead in this film. I am sure that Hollywood has now taken notice that Will Smith has what it takes to be the lead in a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Will Smith is cast in the role of Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens, a young, suave, successful, sophisticated, smooth talker who has devised a career out of his ability to show even the most clumsy and shy, geeky guy how to get hitched to the woman of his dreams. He takes on clients whom he then  coaches in the mysteries of finding one's way into the heart of a beloved, but seemingly unattainable, woman.<br /><br />Our erstwhile dating consultant is hired by Albert (Kevin James),  a chubby, earnest, tongue-tied accountant, who has fallen for one of his firm's own clients, socialite-heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta). She is a trophy type of woman who, one would think, would not even given Albert a second look. Under Hitch's careful coaching, however, even our unlikely, lovesick accountant seems to be on the road to  true love.<br /><br />Of course, them that can, do, while them that can't, coach, and Hitch is no exception. While he can successfully coach his clients to attain the love of their lives, Hitch runs into a whole host of problems in his life when dealing with his own romance. It appears that he has fallen for the gorgeous Sara (Eva Mendes), a local gossip columnist. Despite his ability to ensure that the path of true love runs smoothly for others, he himself runs into many roadblocks and bumps in the road.<br /><br />Will Smith is simply terrific in the role of \\"Hitch\\", playing the role with insouciant charm. His likeability quotient can't get much higher, and he certainly infuses the role with his effortless charm and humor. Hollywood would be remiss in not casting Will Smith in other romantic comedies, as he is such an ingratiating performer that the viewer cannot help but fall in love with him.  As his love interest, Eva Mendes is certainly a gorgeous leading lady, although her character is not always likable. Still, she makes the most of her role as the feisty Sara, and I look forward to seeing her in more films.<br /><br />I totally enjoyed seeing Kevin James in the film. He is the star of the long-running, hit television series, \\"The King of Queens\\", a show that I love and wish would run forever.  I was not disappointed by his transition to the big screen, as I really enjoyed his performance. He is simply a big, cuddly, teddy bear sort of guy that you can't help but love, which helps make his on-screen pairing with Amber Valleta believable. They are simply adorable together. Amber Valleta  successfully infuses her character, Allegra Cole,  with a certain vulnerability that makes her very likable.<br /><br />Kudos also go to director, Andy Tennant, whose deft direction contributes to the success of this film. This is a well-written, well-acted romantic comedy that is highly enjoyable. Co-stars Will Smith and Kevin James have great chemistry in the film and are excellent foils for each other. I would love to see them paired together in a buddy movie, as I think that they would be sensational.  Fans of romantic comedies, however, would be well-advised to see this film. They will be glad that they did.n't get much higher, and he certainly infuses the role with his effortless charm and humor.

B000002H97|1.0|this album supposebly cause metalica to lose some fans...eh what should i know i don't even listen to metalica..come to think of it...what am i doing here? the only good song was enter the sandman. who is this sandman in which they speak of? friend or foe?
B000A88F22|5.0|I liked the show no matter what the critics say. I thought Britney Spears was very funny and real. She seems like a real fun person to hang out with. I don't think being a celebrity has changed her personality much. I have always liked her but I still don't like Kevin Federline, he seems nice and real cool but I just think Britney could have and should have done better. But that's just my opinion.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Soory for the banal title... <br />But seriously, this is one the best albums from the past... 20 years or some, with all the sell-outs crap music around. It has a great list of songs, almost all of them great. (I like this collection better than their Greatest Hits) <br />I even enjoy the more funkey stuff in here, and I don't like much Funk usually. <br />You have pretty much simple music in here, with variety of styles. Flea gives some great bass lines along the way; Anthony is one of the better singers out there, he has a great voice. John gives fine riffs and solos, both funkey and baladic, and has great backing voice. Smith is also doing great. He really rock in the of Purple Stain. <br />The songs: <br /> <br />Around the World - GREAT funk-rocker to open the album. Fast, with driving guitar and bass (even a distored bass in the intro), and raping along the verses. 10/10 <br /> <br />Perallel Universe - More of a alternative rocker. Start softer the its previous, but gets loud in the chorus. Cool solo by John in the end. 10/10 <br /> <br />Scar Tissue - Beautiful, soft song. Anthony's vocals are great, great solos by John. 10/10 <br /> <br />Otherside - Another softer song, again great guitar and vocals. gets loud in the end. John's backing vocals adds a lot to the choruses. 10/10 <br /> <br />Get On Top - A second funk rock song, very cool all along the way. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Californication - The name says it all. You've heard it for sure. 10/10 <br /> <br />Easily - Another great upbeat rocker. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Porcelain - With nice guitars, and subbed vocals, this is the softer and slowest in the Album. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Emit Remmus - I don't like that one much. the guitar in very tiring, and in all the song is too boring. 7/10 <br /> <br />I Like Dirt - Driving, fast, short funk song. Coool guitar solo!... 8.5/10 <br /> <br />This Velvet Glove - Once more :) - relaxing song, with a rhythmic acoustic guitar, and a clean electric lead, Anthony withbeautiful vocals. 9/10 <br /> <br />Savior - It took me to get into this one, but I started liking it finally. a lot of bass drum in the verse, the it gets a little more rhythmic. It breaks into a weird, soft fast section, then gets back to the verse. Another cool guitar solo in the end. 9/10 <br /> <br />Purple Stain - Love it. Cool funk song, with a lot of backing vocals in the chorus. I love the last instrumental minute. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Right On Time - Kinda useles. Very fast, very noisy. 5/10 <br /> <br />Road Trippin' - Wonderful! fast, superior acoustic guitar Backed by bass, and there's some kind of an organ as well. No drums. Once again, Anthony with a breathtaking performence. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I got this cd as a present from one of my relatives. At first I was put off by it because of the fact giddy little school girls on TRL were just gushing over his music. But Gavin Degraw has too great of a voice to be overlooked. If you're like me, you'll enjoy his nice soulful voice with meaningful lyrics. Otherwise you should just stick with Hillary Duff and rest of the snot nosed punks they feature in Tiger Beat.
B00004VVNB|5.0|one of my favorite things about movies about the future is how everything is always a slightly more rad version of now.  i mean, come on!  in the future everything is based on radio waves, over-sized computers and shag hair cuts?!  probably the best example in this movie is the giant gas pump in the new you plastic surgery clinic.  i'm assuming this beast measures not the amount of gasoline that they aren't using to power their non-existent cars, but instead it seems to be measuring the strength of the lasers that miraculously peel away flesh and bone and give guys dark hair because that's what farrah fawcett likes.   <br /> <br />all said in love.  i rarely make it all the way to the end though.  i'm usually losing interest sometime around the skinny dip scene because, well, let's face it - logan's got a flat li'l fanny, and jessica is kind of creepy with that fake-sounding british/cultured accent that people are required to use when they're in movies about the future (carrie fisher comes to mind here).   <br /> <br />all in all, an entertaining film that brings up some of the more poignant \\"what-if\\" questions that we're currently facing with over-population, pollution and casual drug abuse.
0887307280|5.0|Over the past ten years or so (being an owner of several part-time businesses during that span) I have read many books and listened to many people about how to run a business.  While there are many worthy advisors (and many that are not), Gerber tells it like no other.  He very successfully relates his vision of business in such a way that allows the reader to develop one's own business related vision based on solid principles that have been time-tested.  For all that I have read and heard about formulating business models and building business plans for my endevors, I have never really understood what that meant or how to begin to go about it in any personally relevant or meaningful way - until now.  Steven Covey said, \\"Begin with the end in mind.\\"  Gerber, as no other, has helped me to get a clear picture - a real picture - of that end, as I truly want to envision it.  He has also given me a freshly relevant outline of the building process.  I can say, for the first time, that I finally have a solid vision, and a firm *foundation* on which to build.      I usually don't buy books anymore.  I go to the library.  But this one I bought, and I don't regret it.  I want it handy.  I will soon be reading it again, taking notes.
B00005ASHM|4.0|i just smile and realize that a lot of U.S rock fans try to compare this beach boys album with sgt.peppers, i`ve never seen the opposite, nobody compares pepper with pet sounds, it`s unnecesary, amazon doesn,t need to put music samples of pepper, you just can`t deny what the time has demostrated, brian wilson, obviously great composer, felt fustrated after hearing pepper, that`s why he aborted the SMILE project at that time...........relax, it`s a good album, but there are levels
1416500189|4.0|My friend Ron has a Chinese girlfriend. If he marries her as planned, she will be his third wife, each of which has been progressively younger than he.  <br /> <br />So, it is ironic that he would have recommended this book to me. The story concerns a subsistence farmer named Wang Lung, and follows the arc of his life from the morning he rises to go claim his new wife until his waning days. Along his dramatic path, he changes from nave farmer who looks on in horror at the excess of the Chinese ruling classes to one who, with his own wealth secured, exhibits the same behaviors as the wealthy he once so despised.  <br /> <br />It's a great book, rightly considered a classic, and what makes the book even more fascinating is to consider just how recently the events described were occurring in China. The book was published in 1935 and describes life in China in the early 20th century. There are no doubt Chinese citizens still alive who vividly remember this period though it would seem to describe a way of life that passed away long ago. The world the author describes, with peasant serfs working the land while the ruling gentry slowly wastes away from over consumption of life's luxuries, passed away in Europe long before this book was published or the author was even born. China, it would seem, has taken a long time catching up to the West in terms of the condition of its poorest people.  <br /> <br />Deep in the background of the book are the upheavals that came with the arrival of the industrial age, including the arrival of the railroad, and in the case of China, the social revolution that later formed the government. Before this, most people were like Wang Lung, who lived just as his father did, back through the generations. The primary concern of such people was their crops because if the land failed to produce, they and everyone they knew would starve. Such was the life of peasants everywhere at one time.  <br /> <br />I have the `enriched classic' version from Pocket Books, which provides detailed biographical information about the author, Pearl Buck. Buck was the child of Christian missionaries who took her to China where she presumably witnessed first hand many of the events described in the book. The notes also state the Buck's mother renounced her faith at the end of her life, and that Buck was a leading voice of feminism at the time of her death in 1973.  <br /> <br />If Buck's mother witnessed the events described in the book, and if she in fact renounced her faith, it was surely the brutality of the living conditions of the Chinese poor that swung her to the pessimism that destroys a faith in a living and just God. The book vividly describes the condition of the poor as well as the pathetic decadence of the pampered wealthy. Those who have witnessed the worst in humanity, like so many Europeans who lived through the world wars, sometimes can no longer reconcile the wickedness of people and the brutality of nature with the idea of an all knowing and loving God. Such may have been the fate of Buck's mother.  <br /> <br />And yet it is the overwhelming lack of any active faith in a God that stands out in the book. Early on, Wang Lung burns a few pieces of incense to a local earth god that has been made of sticks and paper, and he worries about evil spirits, but there isn't anywhere in his life or in the story an organized church that protests on the part of the poor, admonishes the rich, influences authorities and demands that they act in a moral and responsible way. It is the sheer lack of any voice of moral authority that allows the nature of humanity, which is craven, to dominate. Without such moral guidance, he acts in the same degrading manner as his competitors as soon as he is empowered to do so. His children grow soft and petulant, yet due to his planning and their control of the land, they remain rich.  <br /> <br />Of course, when the book was published, Buck couldn't know what was about to happen. In 1949, thecommunists finally consolidated power over the entire nation and wealthy land owners like Wang Lung were forced into collective farms. The entire system that produced the rise and fall of local landowners was eradicated; all fell together as the state took control of private assets. This was a disaster from a productive standpoint, and so to control the swelling population, the government limited every family to one child, which made the acquisition of more and younger wives a moot point.  <br /> <br />This brings me back to my friend, Ron. I love my friend and I wish him the best, but Ron, like Wang Lung, has no faith and is following his want and will on to a fresh woman, just like Wang Lung. Ron is economically empowered to get a new younger wife, and in China, he has found a willing party. The book describes the process of acquiring a young wife, and it is primarily economic; women are purchased. I've suggested to Ron that the economic disparity between he and his fiance is driving the deal, but he laughs it off. He's having fun, at least for now. The book clearly reasons that relationship entanglements beyond his first wife weakened Wang Lung, and made him unhappy and an object of pity in his old age. If Ron escapes a similar fate, I will be quite surprised.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002G87|5.0|Every artist has a career album and this is Eric Clapton's.  This CD is not only his personal best but one of the All-time Rock classics.  The album is primarily blues and has alot of electric slide guitar on it. This album was put together in the studio over a period of months. The sessions were very long and often they would sleep right there in the recording studio.  Duane Allman plays much of the slide on the CD.  This CD includes the classics \\"Bell Bottom Blues, Key to the Highway, Have you ever loved a woman. Layla and a very strong version of the Jimi Hendrix classic \\"Little Wing\\". There is not a bad song on the entire CD. This will prove to be Eric Claptons' finest hour and still holds up to the test of time.  This CD is a guitar lovers dream. He plays the guitar as only Eric Clapton can. If you like blues you will like this CD.
B0001LQJQM|3.0|This movie was so cheesy! The writing was poor, the storyline was full of holes, and the dialogue was often unintentionally laughable. Some of the acting was really good, but much of it was awful, and Billy Connolly sounded positively sarcastic--I got the feeling he regretted signing up to do this one and was acting the part under sufference. Worst of all, though, this movie had me siding with the French in the big fight scene! Who the hell would ever WANT to take the side of the French in any fight? Sacre bleu! <br /> <br />This movie will never win any awards, except maybe a Raspberry. And yet, I didn't hate it, mostly because of the cool medieval fight scenes. The storming of the castle was amazing, and the 'Greek Fire', 'night arrows' and trebuchets were awesome! (If you're a weapons geek, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!) The hail of fiery arrows was gorgeously coordinated and filmed, and the battle scenes on the castle ramparts were spine-tingling. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a great film then keep looking because this definitely isn't one. But if you're looking for a mildly entertaining movie for a quiet night in, if your expectations aren't at all high, and if you're also fond of medieval times, you might like to give this ago. It'll pass the time, if nothing else, and you probably won't regret it. (Not like Michael Crichton, who undoubtedly has a LOT of regrets about selling the film rights to the book this mediocre movie was based on!) <br /> <br />
B000089CJI|3.0|This recording is a very nice snapshot of how electropop can be interesting and listenable.... Sillohuettes is exceptional both muscially, lyrically and the video is so frighteningly forshadowing its downright depressing in an uplifting way :) Now thats hard to beat.... That said though.... being the old fart in this new musical world.... I can't help but to compare these guys with NEW MUSIK from the late 70's early 80's.  I'm afraid that Tony Mansfield and his group has already taken us as far as this genre can and with better and more listenable results overall..Sillohuettes to be sure is at that level but the other tunes are not..... That's not to say this is a bad record.  It is not... I like it.... It just doesn't measure up to New Musik.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Just saw the movie last night and I was blown away. The story, the music, all of it. And I absolutely loved the dance number Hansel does on the bed!!! How did that kid move his legs like that?!
B00005JNJT|5.0|Finally! We get a Batman movie that is worth the type <br />instead of a run of the mill action film with a boat <br />load of well known (and popular at the time) actors. <br /> <br />The movie starts with Bruce Wayne as a little boy and <br />spends a great deal of the first half of the movie  <br />going in detail about how and why Bruce Wayne became  <br />Batman. It really is a nice change from what the series  <br />has been doing the last two sequels. <br /> <br />Christian Bale is very convicing as Bruce Wayne and I <br />had a great feeling that he would fit the part. He  <br />brought seriousness, but yet fun back to a Batman <br />character that had become a stiff and lame \\"super <br />hero\\" and he wasn't the only one. I thought Michael <br />Cane was very underrated and brought good humor to <br />the Alfred character. It's actually ashame he didn't <br />get more airtime. <br /> <br />This movie won me over when it put character develop- <br />ment and thinking over run of the mill action that <br />seems take the lead in movies such as this. Could  <br />some of the fight scenes brought alittle more? Yes, <br />but it's forgiven since that's not what this is  <br />really about. Another great thing is not one guy <br />totally took the show. It it was pretty much a team <br />effort with the exception of Katie Holmes who just <br />didn't have enough charisma and presence to the <br />movie.  <br /> <br />But it wasn't all her fault... She simply wasn't a <br />good fit and was a girl among men in this movie.  <br />The rest of the cast was just too notch and it  <br />shows that a good balance of acting can make a movie  <br />work more than a movie with one great proformer or two <br />can. <br /> <br />Another thing is that the movie was light on the cheese  <br />and B movie type of lines for most of the movie and most  <br />of the humor felt refreashing and real. Nothing was all <br />that forced here... Just GREAT team acting and a dark <br />feel that hasn't been seen since the first film back in <br />1989. <br /> <br /> <br />5 stars
B00005OAIE|5.0|As a first album of wide release, this is the bomb.  Basically, John's soulful tones relate to a wide spectrum of the listening audience making him one of the top songwriters of his generation.  Mostly this album is full of wit and great guitar playing.  I encourage anyone who has listened to \\"Wonderland\\" and danced along as it played on the radio to check out the who playlist on this album.  Very personal and insightful.  John actually wrote all of these songs and if you have ever the chance to witness him in person...go.  He is electric and spins a great feel to all in the crowd.  His group left me speechless...
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Alright, I never read the book and really don't care <br />too. But why do people get upset if the movie doesn't <br />play out like the book? If it was going to be just like <br />the book there would be little point in even making it <br />a movie. <br /> <br />I thought the movies was abit of the mixed bag... I  <br />thought Brad Pitt was average at best... I really  <br />think they could have got someone else for the role <br />and came better off. He came off pretty well in the <br />fight scenes, but otherwise he was unconvincing to <br />me as a tough cold hearted sword fighter. <br /> <br />Another problem was Blooms character... He was simply <br />way to weak and looked to young. I would have a hard <br />time understanding how a woman would love can compassion <br />for such a weakling.  <br /> <br />Otherwise I think the film had good acting... The guy <br />that played as Hector really took the show in this one. <br />He was convincing as a good fighter, but at the same <br />time down to earth and beatable. The movie showing  <br />Achillies to be so unbeatable kind of hurt Hector <br />and it's ashame... I believe it took alittle sting <br />out of the Achillies/Hector show down. <br /> <br />Also, I think the movie should have put more effort <br />into the fall of Troy instead of so much attention <br />on Achilles. The fall of Troy was simply way to  <br />secondary when it should have got a better role in <br />the film. <br /> <br />This film was very much worth renting... But it falls <br />short of a great movie like Gladiator.
B000063DIH|5.0|the thing with this album is listening to it after the no prayer album you think huh has iron maiden lost it.  but the more you listen the more you like.  quick or dead is a great opener though it sounds nothing like maiden at all.  that basically describes this release in a nutshell.  not like maiden.  the whole time it seemed like it was a different band.  i rated it five because i can't rate 4.5 so i rounded up (because the title track is as if a god helped) there are some great songs like childhoods end that is epic guitaring if i've ever heard it, and i know a lot about epic guitar playing.  most of the tracks good but two are truly the work of maiden.  judas my guide is awesome but way too f***ing short.  you should push a great song like that to at least the 5 minute range.  but Fear of the Dark is the main reason this album still sells.  that song is perfect.  perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.  most maiden fans try to duplicate this song when writing a song themselves because it has all the elements of a great iron maiden song.  but don't buy the album with that song in mind, for the cd doesn't resemble that song at all and it is the last track so you would have to skip a lot.  hardcore fan you'd already have it but anyone else, shouldn't be your first, but why the hell not!?
6305678715|4.0|It's not the greatest thriller out there, but its decent enough to enjoy if you just don't assume that its a bad movie. Sean Connery does an excellent job, and Mark Harmon is not as wooden as other reviews would have you believe; he is at least comparable to his role in Navy CIS on tv.  The action scenes are good, especially the foot chase in Chinatown. And the San Francisco locations are used to create a nice atmosphere. Connery and Harmon play off each other quite nicely and there are many scenese of subtle humor...a good movie.
B000063DI9|5.0|this was a songwriter's \\"wet dream.\\"  when i first heard this album i didn't like it.  i didn't even know it was a concept album untill i listened close and found a new and evergrowing interest in the album.  a lot of people frown on concepts and it's a risky thing to attempt but Maiden struck gold with this masterpiece.  the opener Moonchild caught my attention and drew me in to hear more of this tale.  it's hard to say that a casual fan of Maiden would like this album but it's definately a good buy for anyone else.  though there is only one hit song (the evil that Men do) this is an AWEsome record that makes songwriters piss on the songs they've tried to write.  the guitar work is similar to that of their previous album though it is more agressive.  bruce's voice PERFECTLY complements the story line with an aggressive air raid siren style that if only he kept for the next album (that was a disaster)this album is wonder ful and you should buy it.  great harmony, rhythm, and vocals.
B000002OX7|5.0|All of these reviews are right on. Very simply, one of the greatest rock albums ever made period. If you are reading these reviews to determine whether to buy, look at the number of people and the average rating. If this isn't a 5 star then no CD is.
B00000DSEN|4.0|a lot of people don't like this album.  the problem with this album is a two part problem: bruce dickenson decided to no longer sing but choke on phlem and producer Martin Birch actually allowed it all to happen.  like i said they had to screw up eventually.  they had made seven GREAT albums in row and needed to make a less critically acclaimeed album.  coming out of their seventh son tour they were burnt out, it's painfully obvious.  i cannot stress enough however that there are some good songs here if only bruce had sung the way he was hired to sing.  i don't blame him or anyone but they had a good album going but it sounds more like a demo than an actual produced and thought out record.  the worst track is Holy Smoke that is the most annoying song EVER written, sorry bruce. but damn.  i have actually begun to like the album and listen to it quite often and enjoy a few songs.  the title track had potential but was destroyed by the \\"sound like you're dying\\" vocals and disasterous ending.  my favorite track is public enema number one.  it sounds great and has a catchy chorus with a great melody.  bring your daughter to the slaughter would be the best but there's a dreadful part in every chorus when he first says \\"let her go\\" really high he doesn't hit the note and sounds bad AND FOR ME RUINS THE WHOLE SONG.  of the ACTUAL iron maiden albums (79-93 & 2001-)this is without a doubt their worst but still a must have for a true fan.
B000002UA7|5.0|...It should be great, Kate Bush is one of the most talented and original artists ever to grace the music world.<br /> She has an utterly undefinable style and her songs, as such, are electic, moving, witty and intelligent.<br /> There are some great tracks here, some of the best Kate ever penned and recorded, but there are glaring omissions.<br /> The fact that this has been the only retrospective album of her work is bizzare, it was created at the height of her career in the late 80's, nothing has evolved since which given that she has now not recorded nor released any material since the mid 90's is exceedingly odd. As such this album misses an enormous slice of her later work but it equally neglects a good deal of her early work too.<br /> My personal faves here are \\"Cloudbusting\\", which is gentle, rich and beautiful; \\"Running up that Hill\\", which is a weird, chanting and haunting and \\"Experimnet IV\\" which is full of mystic longing and ephereal beauty.<br /> See how the descriptions vary? This is the only pin downable aspect of Kate, that she is unfailingly unpin downable! For me the album would have benefited greatly from some additions like \\"This Woman's work\\",  one the most beautiful songs in the world! Maybe some work from \\"The Red Shoes\\", her last album and the sublime Elton John tribute from the \\"Two Rooms\\" album. Kate singing \\"Rocket man\\", is stirring, shiveringly good and classic Kate.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|with their reunion in 2000 and their new album Brave New World, they had reached a new height of songwriting and their fans were lenient on what to be strict about after all it had been almost a decade.  however no leniency was needed for BNW because it had such powerful songs like The Whicker Man, ghost of navigator, blood brothers, dream of mirrors, out of the silent planet, and thin line 'tween love and hate (though those last two are questionable.  us fans eagerly awaited a follow-up and with their performance at Rio we saw that they were still running strong.  2003 was arguably a good year for metal, we had metallica release a new album and Iron Maiden.  though both fell short of people's expectations, they had highs and lows.  like i said maiden tried too hard (or not hard enough, who's to say) to satisfy their needs to write emotional and epic masterpieces.  the first few songs are good, catchy, not great though still a GOD amount better than ANY nu-metal crap.  it's nice to hear melodies in this day and age.  the title track much to most people i talk to's dismay is the best on the album.  it is their most folky ever but is a great song (originally how songs used to be) their influences of jethro tull and wishbone ash are very evident here.  the guitar PERFECTLY complements what the song is about and how it's written.  i personally think tjhat bruce could've done better on the high notes, i know they're middle-aged but it just sounds sloppy.  don't get me wrong there are great songs on here and it's the first album ever that Nikko ever wrote a song on.  i recommend it only to a serious maiden fan and for anyone else to not judge the band at all from this album.  it's great though.  any fan who dissagrees isn't a fan
B00004XONN|3.0|Here's the truth I've learned about most records that divide a bands fan base right down the middle. You know what I'm talking about right, a record where one half of the bands fans proclaim the record as a work of genius, while the other complain about how it's crap? Well, here's that truth: both sides are, nine times out of ten, wrong. Usually the truth lies somewhere in the middle. And Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" is is a pretty prime example.<br /><br />Now I side with the latter, this band has turned to crap, on \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Hail to the Thief\\" because neither record was particularly interesting to me, but \\"Kid A\\" is a whole different kind of monster. It is an interesting record, and at times a great record. But it's not an all around great record. Let me explain here.<br /><br />Many people will tell you that you need to listen to this record multiple times to absorb it all, to truly understand it's brilliance. This is partially right. You can't listen to this record as background noise, even though occasionally(\\"Kid A\\", \\"Treefingers\\")that's exactly what it sounds like. But I doubt you will find brilliance after many repeating listens. Many people assume that a record as dense as this must be great, that if as much as work went into recording it as it seems there was with \\"Kid A\\", well then man it has to be great. But this isn't true.<br /><br />Now, as I have stated previously, \\"Kid A\\" does in fact flirt with brilliance at times and achieves. \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\" is an excellent mood setter, with lead singer Thom Yorke mumbling lines like \\"yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon\\" over the type of moody, quiet synthesizers. \\"The National Anthem\\" rocks a bass line that is familiar and origanel at the same time, and rocks a horn section that Morphine would have killed for. \\"Idioteque\\" is, in my opinion, the best electronic song these guys have done, a tense, dark track that appears to be about the end of the world, with Yorke sounding as though he's recording the vocals locked in a tight, airless cage. It's starangely horrifying on your first listen, yet compelling. And \\"Optimistic\\" evokes what the timeless Joy Division would have sounded like had Ian Curtis lived a little while longer.<br /><br />But that's about it. The rest of the tracks(with the exception of \\"How to Diassapear Completley\\" which is pretty good if unremarkable) are basically just background noise, confusing enough to please Aphex Twins fans but quiet enough to sound perfectly in place in at a dentists office, except \\"Kid A\\", which is a long, dull drone of a song that goes nowhere for way to long.<br /><br />\\"Kid A\\" is neither the great record it's enthusiasts have imagined nor the unlistenable piece of garbage it's detractors will have you believe. I mean, a record with such passionate feelings has to be decent right? It is worth a listen. The band gets points for trying to bridge out a bit right? Defintely, ecspecially in todays tired rock community. But trying doesn't mean achieving. Radiohead achieve what they aspire for with \\"Kid A\\" about fifty percent of the time. But that's jsut not good enough to make this record great.cked in a tight, airless cage. It's starangely horrifying on your first listen, yet compelling.

B000006RHM|5.0|the people that complain about this album are the same people that would complain about Metallica's Black Album when it first came out.  with this album Iron Maiden drifts away from argessive metal and shifts towards a more artsy and mature sound.  however this is there most professional sounding album until Brave New World.  the guitar work is phenominal with much of Adrian Smith's influence on the record and Bruce's voice is superb.  funny that it is about an octave lower than that of Beast or Peice of Mind, but don't worry you'll still get the air raid vocals that we all love so much.  my only complaint about the songwriting is simply The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner.\\" great melody and perfect harmony but the topic is pretty lame.  but songs like the title track and Alexander the Great are magnificant achievements in songwriting. this is their leap forward album just as metallica had.  unfortunately they both changed severely afterwards although the follw-up albums actually are great.  i STRONGLY recommend this album to ANY iron maiden not just the casual though you can't judge the band without the Beast album as well.
B00005JNSK|4.0|In this interesting remake of a classic that delivers a very different movie to be enjoyed by a very different audience Tim Burton and Jonny Depp go to extremes in Charlie and the Chocolate factory. Unlike the 1971 original there aren't the musical scores and balance of weirdness and good humor here, this one is all about weirdness.  But coming from Burton who brought us greats like \\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\\" and \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" we can only expect a strange take on the film.  Depp of corse adds his own dash of strangeness to the blend making this a film that feels dark quirky and strange.  While the premise of the original and (the book) are roughly the same to this one it is the feelings that have changed and while both movies can be split into two parts, before Wonka and after Wonka, in the Burton's remake the second half is all Wonka where the children only play a supporting role.   <br /> <br />What this film has going for it is an amazing display of great effects and visually stimulating scenery and some wry and sarcastic lines from Depp.  While Gene Wilder's Wonka was a character that was strange but loveable, Depp's is well just strange.  The oompah loompahs do get more speaking parts and sing actual lyrics from the actual book which coming from Dahl are naturally very cute and funny with just an aspect of the bizarre.  What the film lacks is that emotional charge that made the audience sympathetic to Charlie - of course the title is a misnomer - this film is all about Wonka. <br /> <br />While this film is a completely different film from the original it is still worth seeing.  I will say that I like the original better but this is an interesting take on the same story.  Tim Burton and Jonny Depp fans will certainly appreciate the film since the film literally exudes their essence.  Considering the competition of this summer's films I am sure that this film will do well.  So enjoy this one I don't think this one will be the classic that the 1971 versionwas but it is still a decent film. <br />
B000063DFQ|5.0|Iron Maiden has changed a lot throug the years but every longlasting band does.  most will agree that the first five (but they mean four) albums are their greatest.  however what i really love about maiden are Bruce Dickenson's vocals.  so for me their hay day is up to the seventh son album.  if you love bruce's voice than this is the best album ever and you should get it immediately.  the guitars crash in and never relent at all.  Where eagles dare is a song that epitomizes Bruce's role in the band. this is a song that no other singer cand come close to singing right.  that last high note is jaw dropping.  revelations is the first sign of a more artsy style but an amazing song.  the rest are all classic and The Trooper is their best RECORDED song ever (live it just isn't as good) this and The Number of the Beast album are their greates albums to date.

B00092ZL80|4.0|Take two legendary groups from the '70's and '80's, put them in one of the greatest venues in the USA, and prepare yourself for one unforgettable show! Both groups perform all their best hits, and even join forces for many of them. The sound is amazing on most of it, but there was one problem, which I'll cover below. Notably absent from this concert was Peter Cetera, whose voice was omnipresent on so many of Chicago's songs. Keith Howland performed most of the songs Cetera sang on the albums, and did so quite well. But I still would have preferred to have the original voice there. Howland was one of the younger band members (definitely not one of the originals), but was as adept with Chicago's songs as any of the founding members, all of whom must be in their 60's by now. Robert Lamm looked and sounded great; there must be a picture of him somewhere doing the Dorian Gray bit. I mentioned a problem with the sound; apparently, on the second disc, the DTS track is missing the rear channels. Being an audiophile, I prefer DTS over Dolby Digital when the choice is available. But the Dolby Digital track on disc 2 is complete with rear channels. I have to wonder if Image Entertainment is aware of this problem. It's due to this that I give this set only 4 stars rather than 5. I'm not aware of any albums available in surround from Earth, Wind, and Fire, but Chicago II and V are available on DVD-Audio with full 5.1 sound.Both are worth adding to your collection.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I've been thinking on this subject for a long time. How can people be overdosed by the TABLOID junk; and how can people cover real art with a piece of cloth solely.<br /><br />People loves to believe in that artists are inserted by a superior power. They never understand and they never learn to appreciate that artists are the one who brings these HITS to life.<br /><br />For a long time Mariah Carey was blamed to be \\"Mrs. Thomas Mottola\\", and they thought Mariah was over-inserted by Thomas Mottola. Yet, everybody denied to see that, that was Mariah singing on her first to latest albums. It was underestimated that Mariah caught the hearts of milions of people. It was her songs, her feelings that she lend us to taste from.<br /><br />Tabloid blinded people with that same phrase: \\"DIVA IN NEED\\".<br /><br />I was saying what I'm saying now too when they first used this phrase in 2001 with \\"Glitter\\". It was highly artistic, but tabloid was not as high as her product.<br /><br />Now, year 2005, and Mariah Carey's \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" is as duelling as her previous \\"Music Box\\", \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Rainbow\\", \\"Emotions\\"... or dosens more. The bouqette of real artistic journeys are gifted in this disk. I hope Mariah were a SonyBMG artist again, so that we'd have her dualdisk mutually with that good quality of sound. Whatever, dualdisk may not be a big deal for some.<br /><br />This recording by Mariah Carey is the closest to Columbia years, yet artistically inventive as Island is a bit more radical in style.<br /><br />Mariah Carey: It's GOOD when you know you'll always have GOOD! NO ONE ELSE CAN EVER MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR VALUE and ART. TABLOID IS ONLY JUNK!<br /><br />I hope you'll celebrate all the gainings from this album K-I-S-S-I-N-G!!! :D
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Vanessa Redgrave (* 1937) made her world-wide film-debut in \\"Blow Up\\" (1966) with her very slowly and erotically stripped back (as mysterious, murder-hushing Jane) - and she created thereby a long-lasting image. With her special sort of secrecy she built up a profumo-christine-keeler-affair-impression. If one examines Redgraves developing image profile more exactly - alike photographer Thomas (played by David Hemmings) in Michelangelo Antonionis movie is working in the darkroom making blown up photos, then one discovers, that nothing remains as it is in the beginning (and that is the message of \\"Blow Up\\" too). In the year 1968 she played among other things the legendary dancer Isadora or the sexually tractable Mrs Codrington (in \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\"), however 1980 (Playing For Time) she picked out a completely oppositely role: a Jewish survivor of a concentration camp (Julia). The power of pictures is a rapidly changing matter also in the case of Redgrave. This sort of trend-progress encircles the entire identity of an actress, but as a reacting subject with quite strong radiant emittance strength in addition, an actress again can arrange retroacts on the medium profile. It nevertheless surely does not remain without reaction-strength that Vanessa Redgrave strove for roles in films, which were occupied with the cultural heroes of British history so for example with Lord Byron or Churchill. As the sex-crazed, Christ-obsessed Mother Superior fantasising about Oliver Reed in Ken Russell's \\"The Devils\\" she won her longstanding disapproval of The Vatican. Visiting Fidel Castro (1962) or Yasser Arafat (1972) made two more different sorts of contracting parties. Finally in the film \\"If These Walls Could Talk 2\\" she played a lesbian woman (in the atmosphere around 1961 without any social acceptance), in \\"Howard's End\\" (and also in \\"Little Odessa\\") we experience Vanessa as a critically ill, death-nearing person (they didn't need to paint the face largely for this role). A way back to the \\"Blow-up\\"-striptease-performance surely would not be applicable for her today (image reasons), particularly because she briefly had been busy with lesbian ambitions. Nevertheless she is a mother of two daughters (Natasha and Joely Richardson) and one son (Carlo Nero, from a second partnership). In 1990 she argued around for the Marxist British labour party; she appeared in Sarajevo or donated 2002 a large benefaction, in order to support a Czech, anticommunist person, 2004 she agitated like a British counterpart of the US Heroe Jane Fonda against the Iraq war of the Bush administration.

0783226063|2.0|This movie is like reading the first chapter and then a bulleted outline of the rest of the novel. <br />It begins okay, building up Paul and his supporting crew, but about half-way through Lynch kicks it into high gear and we see this one hour montage of highlights with music from Toto.  By the time the credits were rolling, I was cringing at this tumbling stack of cards. <br />Go grab the miniseries; it does twice as much with a third of the budget.  They actually bothered to show his transformation into Mau'Dib.   <br />Also, if you decide to watch this film, please pay attention when they roll out the alien in to the emperor's chambers and a guy on the left side trips and falls...hilarious.

I have come to conclude that there is no magic pill to swallow that will solve your weight problems because I have tried a lot of them.  What I have discovered is this fantastic book and I am here to tell you that KNOWLEDGE alone is all you need to kick sugar out of your diet forever!  This book will blow you away and it just makes sense once you read it.  I have read the book once and discovered the importance of the knowledge contained within with many eye opening revelations and \\"WOWs\\", then I read it again and highlighted the important points (which there are a lot of) and then I sat down on my computer and wrote them down in a word document.  I carry this document around with me to reflect on how dangerously close I was to not finding an answer to my imprisonment of unhealth and I also reread it once a month or so just to keep it fresh in my mind and remind myself of the significant dangers of sugar.  I learned about this book from Anthony Robbins which he mentions in his audio program \\"Living Health\\" which I also highly, highly recommend.  Anyone who knocks this book, I perceive, is part of the diseasestablishment.  That is they are either part of the sugar producing conglomerates or their business is directly related to sugar, etc.  There is simply no other explanation and once you read this book you will understand!!  This book, as cheap as it is will without question be the best money you have ever spent, as well as the best thing you have ever done for yourself, period.
B000069CWE|5.0|Reanimation is an excellent album, and in my opinion, better than the two \\"real\\" albums that Linkin Park has released as a band. Reanimation has a very underground hip hop vibe to it, and that's what makes this album so great. The world class flow of Chali 2na alone makes picking up this album worth it. Black Thought also delivers. I don't even think of Reanimation as a remix album, because these songs go so far past the originals.

I do not have under my belt the experience of hearing what you heard. Quite frankly, if I heard them now, I might label them as outdated. However, there is undoubtedly an irresistible charm, a magic that lingers about the music of that time period. I don't want to miss out on that. <br /> <br />Michael Buble has taken music that has been copyrighted onto the hearts of America's older generation and has made the sound relevant to....me. To my friends. We can and WANT to listen now. What we might have scoffed as 'old-fashioned' has become delicious to us. <br /> <br />Perhaps we owe Buble a little more than our criticism.

It's Shrek, a a wonderful animated film that, among his many surprises, mocks classic fairytales.<br /><br />The movie cleverly shows a tale similar to The Ugly Ducking, but in this case, the star is a green ogre that lives in a swamp and uses ear wax to light his home.<br /><br />Close to Shrek's home, is the magic kingdom of Duloc (sarcastic) where lord Farquaad sends to exile all of the fairytales' characters, whom inevitably arrive at Shrek's swamp.

1563894696|5.0|I've always been a big Batman fan, but I'm convinced that just about anybody could read this story and enjoy it.  With the release of \\"Batman Begins\\", I got the itch to return to my childhood roots and once again discover the dark world of Gotham City.  I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />What really makes this story great is the mystery.  Gotham City is run under the iron fist of the Falcone crime family.  It appears nothing can stop them until one Halloween night one of their members gets shot to death.  So begins a string of murders that baffles the Dark Knight to no end.  The story moves fast enough to keep you interested, but important detail isn't spared.  Like Star Wars, Batman has a cluster of recognizable characters that are truly special.  Jeph Loeb has a real knack for handling these characters in just the right way.  Tim Sale's illustrations also fit the tone perfectly.  The mystery builds great momentum as you move along, and when you reach the climax you most certainly won't be disappointed.  This is a story of trust, murder, deception, and Two-Face, one of Batman's more tragic villains.<br /><br />If you like comics or Batman, then you should have already read this because it's a classic.  If you think comics are just for kiddies, then this is a good one to pick up and try.
0446310786|5.0|This is one of those works I reread ever few years.  Each time I read this wonderful novel I am even more impressed than the last time.  This work has some of the best character developement I am aware of.  It is a absolute delight for no other reason than this.  Of course the book gives us a wonderful picture of the South during the 1930s.  I actually feel that you can and will appreciate this work more had you lived during that time and in that area.  This work was no \\"required reading\\" when and where I went to school, which is a pitty.  It is a work more people should be exposed to.  I do note, through reading these many reviews here, that there is a direct relationship between the age of the reader and the appreciation of the book.  I am not at all sure the younger reader (and I do not mean this as a put down) can truely appreciate this particular work until they have been around the block a few times, both in life and in literature.  I think there may have to be a certain maturity reached before the appreciation can be reached.  This is true of so many things.  Had I read this in my early teens or late teens, I am not sure I would have like it all that well myself. That being said, I do feel that any reader will be much richer, in the long run, for having read this work.  I highly recommend.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This is a great insight of the way drug use is destroying lives  in urban America today.      It has extremely good camera shots in the scenes in which Jered Leto and Marlon Wayans are injecting drugs. Also, they shot the certain scenes well that involved the character Sarah Goldfarb, because it builds the uneasyness inside of you while you are watching it, and it makes it seem as the movie is going on that Sarah is becoming more mentally damaged from her use of certain amphetimenes that she is taking.    This movie creates a message, which creates a much more powerful impact on the veiws of many people then a lot of the cheesy anti-drug commercials. The end leaves you hollow inside from watching these characters try to fulfill their dreams, when the drive for their satisfactions of their dreams ends up crashing down on them at the end.      When Sarah is watching the TV show over and over again, it makes her think more and more that she will end up being on it, however the effect of the amphetimine in the diet pills makes her clueless of to what's going on in reality. At the end, the scene in which they need to give her shock treatment and soon afterwards she ends up in the insane asylum, from my opinion, is the most dramatizing, nerve-racking part of the film. (Other then the scene that Harry wakes up with a stub for an arm.)    The characters have a drug addiction, but what drugs are they using? In the scenes in which the characters Marian and Harry snort drugs, it looks like cocaine, but has the effects of meth, from their contant insomnia.  It could be either coke or meth from the adrenialine rush.  That is what confuses me.      People act like watching this movie twice only doubles the amount of hollowness inside of you and makes you even more concious of the dangers of drugs, that devastates you to think what they do to so many people.  If you are considering veiwing this film, i recommend that you do not watch it twice, because watching it once already gives you the message. I did manage to watch it twice, and the second time made me shiver all the way down my body a repeaded time from the first.  However, i suggest you do veiw this breathtaking, fact-based work of art.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I'll not mince words, I'll not try to feign some foreign objectivity in this review; I am a fan boy. A comic fan boy, a Batman fan boy. So, obviously, I went into Batman Begins with certainly a different mind set than most. A mind set of great hope for the quality of the film, and, if that hope was dashed, an elevated level of dislike and disappointment. I happily report that upon viewing this film, there was absolutely no need for feelings of disappointment on my part. The movie is, simply put, perfect. If not as a film in its own right, than as an faithful adaptation of the character of Batman. <br /> <br />So, where to begin my critique? Well, the heart of every film is its story/plot, so I'll start there. Begins' is excellent. I've known it for quite some time, having read the script to the film over a year ago (even wrote a review about it), so there really wasn't anything \\"shocking\\" for me in that department. But still, what impressed me the most about the Begins script months ago, once again impressed me on the screen. The story is simply huge. In both scope and depth of plot. A LOT happens in this movie. More than anything that's happened in the previous Batman movies, maybe more than anything that's happened in any superhero movie. This, thusly means no minutes are wasted in Begins; every scene has a purpose and serves a point to the plot. Which makes the movie quickly paced and never, ever boring. I never go into a lot of plot detail in my reviews, but suffice it to say there are plenty of twists, turns, emotional impacts that will keep your eyes locked to the screen. Including an end scene which may not just be one of the most iconic scenes ever, but also drops a big hint of the great things to come in Batman's adventures and, hopefully, in Begins' sequel. <br /> <br />The thing that impressed me the most about the film was the acting. Every performance is stellar. Probably the best cast and performance since the Lord of the Rings. And not only is everyone excellent, they each give breath life into their character, and give it a...personality all its own. Liam Neeson as Ducard plays the perfect mentor role, just as he has done repeatedly during his career. Michael Caine proves himself to be the best Alfred ever; balancing wit and concern for his Master without becoming a nag. Morgan Freeman is almost endearing as the film's \\"Q\\" character; providing Bruce with all the necessary equipment to become the legend he desires to be. Gary Oldman simply is Jim Gordon, quickly become an almost impromptu sidekick of Batman's, and does so in a way that's both fun (sometimes even funny) and smart. And Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow does the most of his somewhat limited screen time and steals every scene he's in. And doing it without stealing the movie; a flaw of the previous Batman films and villains. He's marvelously creepy, and simply devours his dialog and spits it back out with a fervor and passion you don't often see. I'll definitely be paying close attention to Murphy's burgeoning career, as he may indeed turn out to be something quite special in the acting world in years to come. Also, mentions should also go out to Tom Wilkinson and Rutger Hauer for their supporting rolls as Carmine Falcone and Mr. Earl respectively. These are professionals, and they display their expertise in every scene. <br />Then at the center of this grand opera of oscar-caliber acting, there is Christian Bale. The fan favorite. The cult icon. He is...amazing. He gives, without a doubt in my mind, the best portrayal of a superhero ever. Even surpassing the late, great Christopher Reeve. He gives Bruce a personality that, frankly, I have never fully seen before. Even in the definitive Batman: The Animated Series. As Batman, Bale is animal. In every scene of the word. The crutches in the shadows, perches upon rooftops, and barks orders to all around him. If you ever wondered exactly how someone could be afraid of a guy dressed up in a Bat costume, Bale more than answers your question. You could be afraid. You would be afraid. Bale's Wayne is really a four dimensional character, which each one done to perfection. We see Bruce go from a lost, troubled adolescent, to a hardened, but just as lost, man, and then finally becoming the Bruce Wayne he should be. The Bruce Wayne we all know. Only a bit different. A bit better. This is something I was specially amazed by. So far, we have either seen Bruce Wayne as a cold, remote...shell of a man really in the previous films, and even the cartoon, or as a flat out jerk in the comics. Bale sidesteps either of these personalities. Instead he becomes something much more human and relatable. A person you truly feel sympathy for. As much as Bale's Batman is an animal, Bale's Bruce Wayne is a person. And a damned good one, at that. <br /> <br />Of course, the \\"real\\" Bruce, he must create an outward, playboy persona to deter any...suspicions, and, unsurprisingly, Bale does this perfectly as well. Taking a page from his performance in \\"American Psycho,\\"  Bale makes Bruce into the ultimate billionaire airhead. He's selfish, conceited, and downright stupid. A newspaper headline near the end of the film most notably spells that out. The performance is almost funny, without ever being campy or overly silly. <br /> <br />As for Katie Holmes, an actress I have little love for, she actually does quite well herself. Her performance is definitely the weakest of any of the main characters, but it's by no means bad. I wasn't expecting much from the character of Rachel, after I had grown to loath her since reading the script, but Holmes did a pretty good job of breathing life into the character and actually making her...likable. While her performance could be topped, you really can't complain. <br /> <br />Visually, Begins is many things. From the ice and snow-capped mountains of Bhutan (which is almost a cross between Lord of the Rings and Nolan's previous film \\"Insomnia\\"), to green and bright images of Bruce's childhood, to the dark and Blade Runner-esque shots of Gotham City, there is one consistent; excellent cinematography and rich pallet of colors, effectively touched up by the bleach bypassing process the film went through. Nolan's cinematographer certainly adapted his styled perfectly to fit the world of \\"Batman Begins,\\" making the film seem both epic and claustrophobic, when needed. There's nothing I love more than a beautifully shot film, and Batman definitely pleased me in this area. While \\"Begins\\" isn't quite the best shot film I've ever seen (that mantle goes to LOTR), it's definitely one of the best, and anyone like me who takes enjoyment out of that area of film should be quite pleased. <br /> <br />Howard and Zimmer's score for Batman Begins is much different from the now-classic Danny Elfman score, but that's a good thing, as Begins' atmosphere is so different from the previous films. A completely score was needed, and composers did an wonderful job of reinventing Batman's themes. While I must say I still prefer Elfman's score, the Howard/Zimmer score is very strong in its own right, and leaves no room for complaints. It doesn't have a main, recognizable theme like Elfman's, it's not really noticeable, and, once again, seems to \\"fit\\" with the mood of the movie. <br /> <br />The Special Effects are particularly noticeable. And for just the right reasons. Instead of a sterile, CGI-created environment, Nolan went back to basics, and had nearly all of the effects done the old fashioned way; with real people  Shocking, I know, but amazingly effective. Nothing looks fake about Batman Begins, when Batman's gliding through the sky, it looks like he's gliding through the sky, when the Batmobile's crashing through Gotham, it looks like it's really happening, and why shouldn't it? It was real. <br /> <br />That brings me to my next points; Nolan's \\"vision\\" of Gotham, and, probably the soon to be legendary, Batmobile chase through the city. Gotham is much different in this film than it ever was previously, and personally, I love the change. While I firmly believe Burton's Gothic style in 1989's BATMAN was beauty in every sense of the word, it did have its flaws; Gotham seemed small, and subtly artificial. Nolan corrects this, \\"opening up\\" Gotham by combining a London airplane hanger of sets and the city of Chicago itself to make Gotham look more like a real city, than just a child's nightmare. As for the Batmobile chase, it is as high-caliber as everything else in the film. This Batmobile (also called The Tumbler) does things no one would ever dream, let alone seen, a car doing before. I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of the more famous car chases in the history of film when all's said and done. <br /> <br />Nolan's direction of Batman Begins isn't as...noticeably brilliant as some of his other films, but it is still very strong, and still better than most directors in Hollywood. The film is edited quite well, and judging from the acting performances of the film, his direction to his actors must have been suburb as well. He's definitely turned out, at least, his second best film in Batman Begins. <br /> <br />But now, sadly, I must address the flaw in the movie. Every film's got at least one, and Begins has its own; the cinematography during fight sequences. Many have already criticized Nolan for this. Quite severely, in fact. I wouldn't go quite as far. The fight scenes aren't horrible, they're just simply not the best in the world. I can almost see where Nolan was coming from in his choice of shooting the fights with many quick-cuts and close ups. It's confused, hurried and disoriented; which is exactly what a fight with Batman would be like. So, it's not bad in terms of realism, but for viewing enjoyment, it falls a bit short. <br /> <br />Overall though, I'd have to say without a doubt, Batman Begins is not only one of the best films of the year, but also the most well-made film in its genre yet.

B000007NYS|5.0|Actually, four and a half stars.  Anybody who comes out with a CD as astonishingly good as \\"Car Wheels On A Gravel Road\\" is destined to have all other recordings compared against that one.  So, although Spin magazine recently ranked LW among the 100 greatest CDs of the past 20 years (curiously omitting \\"Car Wheels\\"), for me it falls a bit short of that towering achievement.    The difference on this eponymous CD is that the delivery and the arrangements don't always match the (consistent) excellence of the songwriting.  \\"Changed The Locks\\" is a good example, I think Tom Petty's version was more convincing.    But there's very little to gripe about here, and the highs are both numerous and reach very high indeed. Lucinda delivers songs such as \\"Abandoned\\", \\"Am I Too Blue\\", and \\"Side Of The Road\\" with complete emotional conviction.  She leaves no doubt that she has not only written outstanding songs but has also recorded the definitive versions.    On most of the songs here there is a perfect marriage of lyrics, music, and arrangement.  The lyrics are superb, at times very personal, and always evocative (\\"she's holding a Corona and it's cold against her hand\\").  Delivering lyrics this good with accompanying music that wrenches all of the emotion out of it underscores what a musical treasure Lucinda Williams is.  Thank God she's no longer unknown.  \\"Car Wheels..\\" is still the first choice, but neither this nor \\"Essence\\" will disappoint.

It retains the sound explored in Mutter, a more orchestral and epic sound than that of the technometal of their first two albums. There is some new experimentation, though, mostly in songs like \\"Los\\" and \\"Moskau\\". Overall, it sounds somewhat more lively than Mutter's brooding and dark tone, while still retaining said tone in some songs (Stein Um Stein, Ohne Dich). The only problem that I feel makes it a slightly inferior album to Mutter is the fact that a few songs (Keine Lust, Morgenstern, Amerika) don't quite flow as perfectly as they did in Mutter, although they're still great songs! Either way, it is a great album despite the large number of softer tracks (Los, Ohne Dich, Amour) and the lack of trully heavy fast rockers. It is mostly an epic mid-tempo metal album, and it rocks! <br /> <br />Song by song review: <br /> <br />1) Reise, Reise: The title track opens perfectly where Mutter left off; a heavy mid-tempo anthemic track. The chorus is huge, catchy, and inspiring while the instrumentation is purely EPIC, you'll feel you're in an ancient ship as it rides into a foggy, stormy sea. Think Seeman by way of Mein Herz Brennt or Mutter. The accordion at the end is classic. 9/10 <br /> <br />2) Mein Teil: The lead-off single opens with a BANG. THe song is quite creepy in the verses, and again huge catchy choruses that DEMAND your attention. It's pure metal chaos, and the outro is again, bone-chilling. 9/10 <br /> <br />3) Dalai Lama: The weakest track on the album, but still a good track. Very similar to the previous album's \\"Spielhur\\" (but better) with a little bit of \\"Klavier\\" thrown in: long, a tragic child-centric story. It drags a little, but the choruses are immensly creepy, they'll send shivers down your spine, while the pre-choruses are HEAVY. Very epic. 7/10 <br /> <br />4) Keine Lust: The third single. This song gets pretty heavy and fast in thebeggining with the verses and choruses respectively before exploding into epic tragic second chorus that shout \\"Mir Ist Kalt! So Kalt!\\" (I am cold, so cold). The second half of the song is where it really picks up, as this chorus keeps getting bigger and more epic. 8/10 <br /> <br />5) Los: This song is basically a huge wordplay in german, as los can mean \\"-less\\" [the prefix], \\"loose\\", or \\"go!\\". The lyrics are very cool, kind of \\"You can't stop us\\" lyrics, which is ironic given the laid-back sound of the song. It's the least rammstein-ish song they've ever done [while still decidedly Rammstein), a very cool bluesy track. breaks up the album  pretty nicely. Simply a great song, despite it not being metal. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />6) Amerika: The big single. It's a pretty good song, catchy chorus, good for a single. The highlight is the solo. It is definitely awesome. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />7) Moskau: A fast and insanely catchy song (much better than Amerika, in my opinion), would've been a great single. They originially wanted the TATu girls to sing, but there was some management problem. The song features the accordion again, which just gives it that extra classy touch. Flows great, and is a great rocker. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />8) Morgenstern: This is a very good song, despite that fact that it feels a little broken up. The gothic choruses are simply amazing, with the church choir sending shivers down one's spine. However, the verses are VERY heavy. Both parts are good, they just sound somewhat awkward in the transitions. Either way, just the amazing choruses and lyrics make it increadibly good. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />9) Stein Um Stein: Another creepy song, this one again changes from slow, creeping verses to insanely heavy stomping choruses (kind of like the opposite of Morgenstern). Till really SCREAMS in this one, and both transitions after the chorus are done very well. A humorous note, the last word of the bridge is ramm, and after the pause Till screams \\"STEIN!\\". The \\"solo\\"is awesome. 9/10 <br /> <br />10) Ohne Dich: The first ballad, very heartfelt and also catchy. The string section in it is very well implemented. Reminds me a little of \\"Seeman\\", but with an EPIC catchy chorus. Both the heavy and the light parts sound great, and wow... just the orchestration. It seems like an awesome closer and again, quite epic, like Reise, Reise. Beautiful. 9/10 <br /> <br />11) Amour: It seems a bit of an afterthought, and yet, it fits perfectly. It's more reserved than Ohne Dich, but not as beautiful. The lyrics are one of my favourite parts \\"Love, everyone just wants to tame you, Love, in the end, caught between your teeth\\".  8.5/10 <br /> <br />Overall, Reise, Reise would be a GREAT addition to your collection if you're a fan or even a newcomer. It is fairly accessible, not to mention a HELL of an album.
630460288X|4.0|Sandra Bullock kills every movie she's ever in, so that is my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. She really just gets on my nerves. The story has been talked about already, but I will say that some of the ideas presented were as interesting as the action itself. For instance, in the car they listen to the most popular radio station in town which is really just commercial jingles, getting the public to sing along about products being sold. Scary to think we are halfway to that reality as it is. This movie is full of useless one-liners that almost every american action film is required to have. They aren't as annoying as arnold's movies, and the delivery is pretty funny so it isn't too bad. The action scenes are clearly the standout moments, the one in the museum being the best in the film. Definitely worth seeing, i picked it up on vhs for 2 bucks at a used record store, can't beat that.
