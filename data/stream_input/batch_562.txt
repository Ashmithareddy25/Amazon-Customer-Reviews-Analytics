B00004W510|5.0|<br />Perhaps no musical group exemplified an anti-counter cultural approach to music better than The Band did in various ways. They influenced many people who were influential in their own right either at the time (Eric Clapton and George Harrison's approach to music) or would be in years to come (i.e. Roger Waters' approach to concept album writing with Pink Floyd) not to mention being one of the begetters of 1970's style \\"folk country.\\" And while more could be said about them than that, there is plenty to say about this album and that is where the review will be focused.  <br /> <br />The album opens with \\"Across the Great Divide\\" and it sets the tone for the very down home Americana feel of this album full of uniformly excellent songs. The latter song contains the story of a man who tries to explain himself to his woman and recounts to some extent the recklessness of his \\"younger days\\" as he tries to persuade her to not kill herself. It is not as grim as it sounds in words I assure you.  <br /> <br />The second song is \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" which is a fun quirky song with fiddles, an offbeat drum pattern, a mandolin, a fiddle instead of bass, and the bass parts played on a tuba. The lyrics of the song were about a woman who only wants to play ragtime music...there may be a sly message in that but whatever. That brings us to one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />\\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\" is musically and lyrically a masterpiece. It is ironic a Canadian songwriter (Jaime Robbie Robertson) could write such an empathetic tune about the old South but it the power of the song cannot be denied. It was delivered with conviction by the only American in the group (the southerner Levon Helm). Garth Hudson gets some very textural sounds with a melodica overdubbed via his Lowrey organ, which sounds like a harmonica starting with the second verse of the song. It is an example of the multifaceted talents of the Band's members -all of whom except Robbie Robertson played multiple instruments. I never get tired of hearing this song, singing it, or playing it on guitar. It is followed by \\"When You Awake\\", a song with lyrics are about family and remembering with grandfatherly advice being given.  <br /> <br />From there the album moves to \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" which is a song with a very \\"back porch\\" feel which is (I must say it) deliciously sleazy in a way. Garth Hudson is playing a clavinet through a wah wah pedal to create the sound of a jew's harp. When mixed with Danko's bass playing, it gives a significantly low range to the tune about a narrative of a man who wants to lookup an old girlfriend for \\"assistance\\" if you will and how in many areas she completes him. \\"Whispering Pines\\" follows, which Robertson co-wrote with Richard Manuel. The song has a completely different tempo than the one preceding it and Manuel delivers a very wrenching vocal performance vocally and on piano.  <br /> <br />Following \\"Whispering Pines\\" is \\"Jemima Surrender\\" which has a heavier tempo with boogie-woogie piano (played not by Manuel but by Hudson), Manuel on drums, Levon Helm not on drums but rhythm guitar, and Robertson on lead guitar. (The alternate take --half the songs on the album have an alternative take on this CD- has the members on their usual instruments for a completely different approach to the song.) The song is about the singer wanting a girl named Jemima to give in and...well...that is all I will tell you about it. <br /> <br />\\"Rocking Chair\\" is possibly my favourite song on the album. It is unconventional musically for the group in that there is no drums (Helm is on mandolin on this tune), Hudson plays accordion, Robertson is on acoustic guitar, and the timekeeping is done solely by Danko's bass and that is adequate. The lyrics I find to be quite haunting now in the wake of having lost my childhood best friend last year and for other reasons not to be mentioned here. <br /> <br />\\"Look Out Cleveland\\" is a up tempo rocker sung by Danko with some aggressive lead fills by Robertson backed by Danko's equally aggressive bass picking and is about \\"a storm coming through\\" which ends up devastating everything. (Compared to everything else on the album, this song stands out in its strident phrasing.) <br /> <br />From there the next song is \\"Jawbone\\" and it opens with a very slow start and alternates time signatures from verses to the pre-chorus to the chorus and back again with lyrics about a thief who is unrepentant. The album next moves into \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" which is sung by Danko and is a slow creeper about...well...exactly what the title says and the narrator tries to examine the reason for the faithlessness involved.  <br /> <br />The album ends officially with \\"King Harvest\\" which is a frantic tune sung by Manuel. The song has an unusual sound even for an album of songs many of which are distinctive in that sense. The shifting tempos from verse to verse gives a distinctive sound as does Robertson's stinging lead playing which shows a pleasing restraint to it. The lyrics show the tensions of paradoxical attachments (city and country, past and present, etc) and is a tale about a union man who is feeling the pinch ala Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" and wraps up the album quite strongly.  <br /> <br />There are also alternate takes of six of the songs on the CD release as well as an outtake of a song that would appear on future albums (referring to \\"Get Up Jake\\"). But the twelve songs on the album as originally released are the focus of this review and they all cohere well making this album a must have for anyone who likes good music. <br />
0451527046|5.0|I read this book as a child, and was getting fuzzy on the details, so recently re-read this famous tale. I can assure you that it is more than worthy of its status in literature. Jim Hawkins is a young boy who meets up with a strange and sickly traveler who stays at the Inn for which he is working. The sailor -known as Billy Bones -dies in the night. Upon searching the contents of the dead sailor, a map is found - a treasure map no less! From there we follow the adventures of young Jim as he meets the secretive Long John Silver and his insightful talking parrot on the quest for gold. What mysteries and turns of fate lay waiting for them on Treasure Island? This is a relatively short book, but there is great adventure waiting if you are willing to set your sails for this masterpiece.<br /><br />Relic113
B00005JMJG|4.0|I purchased this DVD after hearing a local radio DJ discuss it on the air. I wasn't certain what to expect, asI've never been a fan of Jim Carrey's work. What I found however, was an intense, powerful performance of a seemingly tragic character (Joel), coupled with an incredible performance by Kate Winslet (Clementine).<br /><br />This film is made in a stream-of-consciousness approach, so I was glad I watched it in mid-afternoon, when I am most awake and alert. I had to think at some of the memory flashes as to whether or not they were a dream, reality, skewed reality, or what. At times the plot-line was hurt because of the constant leaps from one place in time to another. This jumping makes some of the movie hard-to-follow and disjunct.<br /><br />Overall, though, I did enjoy this and would recommend it. I think \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" raises some interesting questions dealing wtih our emotions and our own humanity, and I think it is a film that should endure any criticism it receives.
0321213351|5.0|This book is one of my latest favorites although I picked from my work library..this book really a concepts guru. The author justifies why you need this book exploring what a typical developer do... right from the \\"Over Engineering\\", Patterns Panacea, Under Engineering...and finally justifing \\"Continous Refactoring\\". If you are developers, who realize patterns based approach then it is a must read. As a patterns fan, I chose to read this book after my favorite patterns collection GoF, Head first patterns, Core J2EE patterns, Core Security Patterns, Enterprise Integration Patterns ....and it truly made a difference so that I don't do over-engineering and under-engineering with my patterns.
B0000025H6|5.0|People, look up stuff before you f**king talk! \\"The Wall\\" is not about some random, self obsessed Rock star, it's about Pink Anderson, a f**king Blues musician that was one of Pink Floyd's influences! Hence the name PINK Floyd. Can you guess what Floyd was for? You guessed it! Another Blue's musician! <br /> <br />How can you say the musicianship is terrible? If I don't recall, David Gilmour is one of the greatest guitarists to ever live, and a damn good songwriter too! Nick Mason was a great drummer with lots of rhythm. Roger Waters? Don't even get me started on him. Wake up you ignorant pieces of s**t, cause you don't even know what you're talking about, yet you try and sound as intelligent as possible so you don't lose your credibility, but you come off as unintelligent as possible based on your inaccurate information and ignorant opinions. <br /> <br />And stop with the multiple posts and/or writing multiple reveiws under different names, it makes you look stupid. You're not fooling anybody with your over-repeated nonsense, and it proves you have no life, and nothing else better to do than to try and put down and bring down the rating for one of the greatest Rock albums of all time (even with all those negative reviews, the average is still 4 and a half stars, proving you wasted your time, buh-bye). You can't claim to be a Rock 'n' Roll fan, and yet listen to the stuff listed on your profiles, it just doesn't make sense. That particular comment is intended for about half of you losers who chose to actually use your name.  <br /> <br />Once again, stop wasting your time. Otherwise, a five star album. This was just kind of a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Incredible. This album should make us all morn the youth centered music business, and wounder how many genius songwriters have been written off by the labels because of age. Cohen nearing 70 (I think) on this CD, has more to say than any other artist I've heard in a decade.  Ya, it's all sequenced production...super squeaky clean.  When I first heard it, I (and think God I didn't) almost wrote it off as a old dude stuck in the 80's. Now, I see, it is the perfect medium for Cohen. He is deliberate in his prose, and his music should reflect that. There is nothing more deliberate than midi. I've grown (and it took about 2 listens) to love every subtlety of every song.  <br /> <br />I'm round about 30, and my taste in music does not travel the roads of this CD's production, but when something is genius, it doesn't matter who you are or your taste in this or that, you will recognize it, like it was something built in at the foundation of the earth.  <br /> <br />Am I over doing it? drooling all over this review? No, I don't think so. This CD is a foundation, it will never leave me.
B000002KHH|5.0|Back in the early 70's, there was an unknown band named Polka Tulk, that played Folk Rock. Luckily for them and for us, they dropped the name AND the sound, and became known as Black Sabbath, one of the prime inventors and innovators of Heavy Metal. Parents everywhere were freaking out (I can only imagine how many people wanted to shut this band down) about satanic messages (you know, the usual bulls**t parents do about a Heavy Metal band), and bats getting heads bitten off (hehehe), but they couldn't stop them, and to this day, people are STILL discovering Black Sabbath for the first time, people are STILL getting turned onto REAL Metal thanks to this band, and people are STILL listening to \\"Iron Man\\" for the first time. THAT is staying power, people, and not too many bands have the stuff it takes to still be making LOTS of cash off of a CD you released nearly 40 years ago.  <br /> <br />Not only was Black Sabbath the premiere Heavy Metal Band (along with Zeppelin and Deep Purple), but they were incredibly talented. Their original lineup (which, unfortunately, didn't last very long, as they had enough lineup changes to drive you crazy!) consisted of: Tony Iommi (Guitars)-One of the most popular guitarists out there. He has the most kick ass riffs you've ever heard and had great solos. Bill Ward (Drums)-He was one of the greatest drummers to live, and was very technically skilled behind the kit. His instrumental studio drum solo \\"Rat Salad\\" is one of the best, right up there with John Bonham's \\"Moby Dick\\". Geezer Butler (Bass)-Don't let the weird name fool you, this guy is AMAZING on the bass. He IS, not might me, but IS the greatest Metal bassist out there. Despite the sub-par production, which might kind of drown out the bass, making it hard to hear sometimes (hey, give 'em a break, it was they 70's),  the bass still somehow manages to stand out. Especially in songs like \\"Hand Of Doom\\" and \\"Jack The Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots\\". Ozzy Osbourne (Vocals)-Does Ozzy really even need an introduction? I mean, he was the first Heavy Metal frontman, what more do you need to know? If you STILL don't know who Ozzy is (EVEN after his numerous awards and compilation albums from his solo career(as well as with Black Sabbath), AND the whole bat thing), you really should come out of that cave you've been living in for so long. For the past 20 or so years (maybe even 30), its been almost impossible to escape news of the crazy man behind Black Sabbath. While his voice isn't exactly powerful, or even that good, his stage presence more than makes up for it.  <br /> <br />Now for song ratings: <br /> <br />1.\\"War Pigs/Luke's Wall\\" - One of the most popular Sabbath tracks, and for good reason. What's not to like about this song? Complex drumming, guitar solos, one of the greatest riffs on the planet, GOOD bass playing, and soaring vocals with lyrics that you can tell were actually thought about, and not just thrown together (A side note-I'm guessing this is one of the first peices of political lyrics ever written. Not sure of that though, I might be wrong). (10/10) <br /> <br />2.\\"Paranoid\\" - A pretty straightforward track. Short, sweet, and to the point. Good drumming, good guitar work. That's all, not TOO much of a standout track. (8/10) <br /> <br />3.\\"Planet Caravan\\" - To be honest, I'm not too sure what to classify this song. Its not really a ballad, nor is it a Rock 'n' Roll track. It's still a greatly addicting song. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />4.\\"Iron Man\\" - THE most popular Sabbath song, and one of the most popular songs of all time. This song is flawless. Forget the fact that Sabbath \\"fans\\" say its overrated, because that has nothing to do with the actual song itself, this song is absolutely flawless. The only thing that they could have worked on would've been better production (remaster maybe?). (10/10) <br /> <br />5.\\"Electric Funeral\\" - Great song. Nothing about this song really stands-out to me, but its still a great piece of work. (8/10)<br /> <br />6.\\"Hand Of Doom\\" - Strongest bass performance on the album. Great job by Butler. The same thing goes for this song. Not a real standout song. (8/10) <br /> <br />7.\\"Rat Salad\\" - Legendary drum performance by a legendary drummer. Very good song if you like drum solos and the like, otherwise, this might be the worst song on the album for the average Sabbath fan. It gets a ten from me though, since I find drum solos incredibly entertaining. (10/10) <br /> <br />8.\\"Jack The Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots\\" - One of my favorites off the album. Also a very good and popular song that is nearly flawless. One of the strongest bass performances on the album, and a perfect way to end an album like this. (10/10) <br /> <br />Overall: (73.5/80) Not a bad score at all. None of the songs got below a seven, because even the not so amazing songs are too good to be that low. If you don't have this album, shame on you, go out and buy it as soon as possible, you wimp!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This mini-series is one of the best compared with Pride and Prejudice. I can't stop watching it. The tension between Mr. Thornton and Margaret is unbearable. The ending was perfect. I have read the book. They do vary from it a lot in the series, but it still works out well. I loved the book and the DVD. Highly recommended!!!!!
B000002IMG|5.0|Testament was a very interesting Thrash band. They were influenced by Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer (not so much by Slayer), but they were also almost as good as them. Testament's sophomore 1988 release, \\"The New Order\\" was actually the album that put them on the spot for one of The Big Four of Thrash (Gosh, man, what an honor to beat out Anthrax, Slayer, AND Megadeth). Although that title didn't last long, Testament still produced some of the finest Thrash Metal ever. This was their best work by far. They had everything you could want from a Speed/Thrash Metal band. Speed (obviously), GREAT guitar work, awesome drumming, and their vocalist ain't half bad either.    The lineup for this band consisted of: Chuck Billy (Vocals)- He originally replaced Steve Souza, who quit the band right before recording to join Exodus (another fine Thrash band). He's got some decent vocal work on this album. Not really too strong though, definately intimidating. Alex Skolnick (Lead Guitars)-Probably the most talented person in the band. He ranks as one of the best Metal guitarists ever, and Testament was very lucky to have him. Its very unfortunate he left the band a couple albums later to join Savatage, due to \\"creative limitations\\". Eric Peterson (Guitars)-Very good rhythm guitarist. Great riffs, good speed, decent. Skolnick buries him in the dust, though. Derrick Ramirez (Guitars)-Same thing goes for him. Not as good as Skolnick, but decent. Greg Christian (Bass)-The basslines are mean, and he does a really good job. The production is good enough to actually hear the bass, and thats always a good thing. Louis Clemente (Drums)-Very talented drummer that has plenty of speed and rhythm. The drumwork is actually one of the more impressive things about the album.    Now for song ratings:    1.\\"Eerie Inhabitants\\" - Well, it sure is Eerie, but the intro is so long, that by the time it picks up, you've probably already skipped the song. Its still good though. (9/10)    2.\\"The New Order\\"- Things finally start kicking up with the title track. Just like with every band's album, the title track for this album is promising, and is one of the best on the album. (10/10)    3.\\"Trial By Fire\\" - Things keep going strong with the thrid track. It's not that its bad, I just don't really think much of this song. Something is missing, but I can't figure it out. Still a good song, though. (7.5/10)    4.\\"Into The Pit\\" - This song is SUCH a great headbanger! You really get the feeling you're in the pit when you listen to this song. This is a great song to play live, I'm sure. Its nearly flawless, and the best on the album in my opinion. (10/10)    5.\\"Hypnosis\\" - I cant actually rate this song, due to the fact that it isn't a song. It's basically just a guitar interlude.    6.\\"Disciples Of The Watch\\" - This is actually Testament's most popular song, and for good reason. It got everything you need. I especially like the guitar work, its some of the best on the album, and the riffs are just kick-ass. (10/10)    7.\\"The Preacher\\" - This sounds like a different Testament. Maybe because this is the only song Steve Souza actually recorded his voice on before he left. You can easily tell right when you hear the first word. Still classic Testament, and still a good song, the vocals are just a little more harsh and unmelodic though. (9/10)    8.\\"Nobody's Fault\\" - Great song. Nothing special about it though. Kind of filler. The vocals especially remind me of Dave Mustaine, because he's so snarly on here. (8/10)    9.\\"A Day Of Reckoning\\" - Great song with amazing guitar work, and sounds a lot like the earlier tracks. Good song. (9.5/10)    10.\\"Musical Death (A Dirge)\\" - I love the acoustic work. Its basically an instrumental with a couple of random heavy parts and great guitar work throughout. Its another one of those \\"eerie\\" tracks, which is always a good thing. (8/10)    Overall: (72/80). A great album worth checking out, especially if you love Bay Area Thrash, where the planet's best Thrash comes from. If you're a Thrash band from somewhere else other than the Bay Area, chances are, you're not that good (And I'm saying that as a person who actually lives in the Bay Area).
B00004XONN|4.0|\\"Kid A\\" can basically be viewed as the third installment of a trilogy that began with \\"The Bends,\\" and followed by \\"OK Computer,\\" in that Radiohead's music \\"evolved\\" from using the standard rock and roll instruments (i.e. electric lead and rhythm guitar, bass and drums) to greater reliance on electronica and Eno/Fripp-type soundscapes.  \\"Kid A,\\" though not as monumental as the band's masterwork \\"OK Computer,\\" nevertheless stands out as a terrific album, and, in my opinion, just misses a five star rating, because it could have benefited from one more song of a similar quality to \\"Optimistic.\\"    I detect a theme to this album, reflected in the bizarre artwork, namely an individual's disconnect from life, while still attempting to go throught the motions (sort of like how one might feel after taking too much Benadryl).  Interestingly, Radiohead also takes up a cause, reflected in the liner notes (ala U2 and REM): \\"ice melt around the world,\\" which is a serious environmental problem and future disaster waiting to happen (no doubt related, in part, to the greenhouse effect, caused by certain air pollutants).    With \\"Kid A,\\" Thom Yorke, once again, demonstrates how evocative repetition of a phrase can be.  Let's take the opening track, for instance.  If Yorke just sang: \\"Everything in its right place\\" once, one might interpret this at face value.  But instead, Yorke sings \\"Everything, everything, everything, in its right place, in its right place, in its right place.\\"  See the difference?  Now we get an image of a person acting obsessively to make sure everything is perfectly placed.  Couple this with the insect noises simultaneously heard (in fact, at the end of the song the word \\"everything\\" is transformed into a buzzing sound) and we have something quite disturbing.  Examples of dramatic effect through repetition of phrases can be found in almost every song on \\"Kid A.\\"    Half of the tracks on the album are more like soundscapes than songs, reminiscent of Eno and Fripp (\\"Everything in its Right Place,\\" \\"Kid A,\\" \\"Treefingers,\\" \\"In Limbo,\\" \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\").  My favorite song on the album though, and probably the most \\"accessible\\" track, is \\"Optimistic\\" (\\"If you try the best you can, if you try the best you can, the best you can is good enough\\") which is one of my three favorite Radiohead songs, together with \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Karma Police.\\"     I also like the bass heavy \\"National Anthem\\" with its startling horns (although it's a little too long), and the mock-disco \\"Idioteque.\\"  \\"How to Disappear Completely,\\" ranks as one of their better quiet songs, along the same lines as \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" from \\"The Bends,\\" and \\"Let Down\\" from \\"OK Computer.\\"  \\"Everything in its Right Place,\\" perfectly introduces and sets the tone for everything that follows.    \\"Kid A\\" was a worthy follow-up to \\"OK Computer,\\" and that, by itself, is all that really needs to be said.

B000BYA5GO|3.0|Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a young second generation Ukrainian living in New York's Little Odessa. Life is tough for Yuri; frustrated and poor, he realizes that he's not really that good at anything, with the world pretty much offering him a ticket to know where. When we first meet him, around 1982, he is longing to bust out of the kosher restaurant owned by his father, who fervently keeps up the charade of being Jewish that he invented so he could get his family expelled from the Soviet Union. <br /> <br />I guess when you're raised on a lie; it becomes pretty easy to keep the pretense up. Yuri, recognizing he has a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, hatches a plan with his kid-brother Vitali (Jared Leto) to sell arms and ammunitions: \\"that was the day I realized my destiny lay in fulfilling another basic human need.\\" Of course, there isn't much business for this kind of thing in the States, so Yuri and Vitali find themselves doing business in Berlin during the height of the Cold War.  <br /> <br />Their criminal trade eventually takes them to South America, where Vitali gets hooked on coke, and where, for the first time, they meet their arch nemesis Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an idealistic Interpol agent.  But the bulk of Yuri's fortune is made when the Soviet Union crumbles and its vast cache of weapons is made available to him. <br /> <br />Now Yuri is free to sell his product to war torn Africa, where he becomes professionally entangled with Liberian president Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), a kind of Charles Taylor-like fanatical dictator. Along the way Yuri becomes a very rich man adopting a glamorous supermodel trophy wife Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and tries to help his brother Vitali beat his steady addiction to cocaine and alcohol.  <br /> <br />Director Andrew Nichol's movie is unapologetically purposeful, and his subject matter is incendiary and also quite timely. The devastating consequences of the weapons trade are well known, andLord of War is a forceful film with a lot on its mind. Then why is the film so flat and un-involving? Perhaps because it's all so convoluted - Nichol probably has enough material here for five movies, consequently his narrative never complete meshes; it's as though Lord of War is a film in search of a decent plot.  <br /> <br />It doesn't help that Yuri is played by Cage, one of the most over-rated actors of his generation, doing his usual softly spoken, puppy dog shtick; he blusters when he should be quiet and raves when he should be contemplative. When the dialogue isn't enough to provide the facts, Nichol stuffs Yuri's mouth with cynical, and contemptuous narration to describe the dirty business in detail, but you really have to worry about a film when Yuri's verbal announcements are far more intriguing than the fictional plot devices used to provide human drama. <br /> <br />I guess you could say that Lord of War is mildly intriguing when it deals with the nuts and bolts of the weapons business, and it often sails along with a nifty, amoral irreverence. But it's just too overly didactic and preachy, ultimately sinking under the weight of it's own message and pretensions. What really does this film in is the director's penchant for turning Yuri into a character that we should care about.  <br /> <br />There are a few cheeky moments complete with some funny lines, but after forty minutes or so, it all becomes terribly repetitive. After all, we've got the message in the opening credits, which follow the life of a bullet from the factory to the forehead of a third-world teenager. Mike Leonard January 06.  <br />
B0000024ZT|5.0|..okay maybe not if you have Before The Fame.. <br /> <br />anyway.  no this is not the best Springsteen cd, far from it but this is where the story starts.  i could write and write why this album is good.  all you need to know is that it includes Springsteen's greatest song, \\"Lost In The Flood\\".  hands down his greatest song.  just check out the live version from the BTR rerelease dvd.  unreal.  even the so-called bad songs on here are good.  \\"Mary Queen of Arkansas\\" is an odd but magical song.  \\"The Angel\\" is a very very haunting song that does well following up \\"Lost In The Flood\\".  just buy it.
B000025XKM|5.0|This, Nick Drake's last album, is almost certainly his best.  Despite its clocking in at just under a half hour, it very well might be the best album ever made.  Each note carries with it such weight, such emotional pwoer.  The lyrics are sparse, complementing his solo guitar.  Everyone must listen to this album, it's simply that beautiful.
0743454529|5.0|Few deny the subject matter and majority of the book were enthralling, with some being mystified by the ending. but, what a story. <br /> <br />What it said to me was strive to provide a fantastic life for your kids, enjoy every second of your children's lives and make damn sure they know that you adore them because it has the potential to be blown away with one event.  take the time to think about your children even if you hit a crisis point. love them, find time for them. <br /> <br />this book will most likely make you cry (sob actually if you were caught out like me) but more importantly make you think. the use of the narrative device of a chapter each for the characters provides depth and illustrates clearly the tensions that exist for each character. <br /> <br />i was captured by it from the moment i started but needed to put it down for a few days at a time early on so i could find the strength to 'live' the situation. so recommended, but pick your timing, don't read it if you don't want to be on an emotional rollercoaster.

B00092ZL80|5.0|Saw this same show live at The Shoreline Amphitheatre in California in September 2005 and had such a great time I had to get this DVD.  The DVD has all of the songs I saw/heard live.  The first half hour features both bands on stage beginning with the Chicago tune Beginnings. After they also both perform In The Stone, Earth Wind and Fire does an hour of their hits.  It's followed by Chicago doing an hour of their hits and finishes with both bands back on stage performing each other's songs.  The finale is the most incredible rendition of 25 or 6 to 4 you've ever heard. Sometimes these things with multiple bands on stage together doesn't work.  This does!!!  Other highlights include Chicago's If You Leave Me Now with E,W&F's Philip Bailey on lead vocals.  If you never get to attend one of these shows with these two bands together the DVD is a pretty good substitute.
0671027387|4.0|The President's reelection campaign is in trouble. An ambitious Senator is surging up in the polls. He is attacking NASA as being incompetent and wasteful. Nasa announces that a meteorite had been discovered deep in the Arctic Ice that demonstrated proof of Extraterrestrial Life. An attractive,bright,ambitious woman is personal assistant to the senator. She has had an affair with him and is suspicious of his motives. The head of the National Reconnaissance Office is deeply involved as are a group of Delta Force soldiers. The President has put together a group of non partisan scientists to confirm the find as legitimate. Plots and counterplots keep the pages turning quickly.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|When I purchased Mezmerise, I loved it. But at the same time, I was extremely dissapointed, because at the time, I thought Mezmerise to be so great, there was no possible way SOAD could top it, ever. I bought Hypnotize, Listened to it once, and was dissapointed as I predicted. But after I listened to it a few more times, the songs slowly start to grow on you. And now, I think Hypnotize has no doubt topped Mezmerise. And this is to the other reviewers who said they didnt like it after listening to it one time, You gotta liusten to it more than that, it'll hit you eventually that it is a great albumn, you just got to give it a chance.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I've never really written a review before, but this album is really one of my favorites. It has an overall 'sad' feeling .. without feeling depressing. Ryan Adams, makes the harmonica sexy. You lose youself in the lyrics, and music which sweeps you through every feeling .. and back again. It's one of those 'emotional' records that captures your imagination and never feels stale or tired no matter how often you listen to it. Since 2001 it's regularly made it's way through my cd collection's top five.  A must have!!!
0780626494|4.0|Cute enough premise for a fun, romantic comedy.  What saves it from being sappy and somehow elevates it above the level of \\"mediocre\\" are the earnest and exceedingly charming performances of Brenden Fraser in the leading role and supporting turns by Spacek and Walken as his parents.<br /><br />While the DVD offers nothing noteworthy (a compilation of some 1960s news footage or kitschy adverts might have been fun), this is a sweet movie that is fun to watch.  Fraser does an excellent job as the boy/man Adam.  Even in underwritten roles, Alicia Silverstone and Dave Foley have some genuinely appealing moments.
0345409671|3.0|i could see how some would have been greatly offened by Anne's choice to have such a heavy religious theme. Being raised Catholic myself, (though experiencing a change of heart while growing up) i wasn't shocked by a lot of what was said.  <br /> <br />But, the only thing that truly, TRULY shocked me and almost made me forget the book all together was the -very- graphic scene where Lestat drinks from Dora's menstral blood. That is a very taboo line that shouldn't have been crossed, Mrs. Rice. And it has nothing at all to do with the plot! <br /> <br />i guess she just loves to shock us, no? <br /> <br />Other than that filth, i think the story is interesting. Especially how it is told from the Devils' P.O.V. We finally get to hear his side of the story. i don't say that i pity him, but it does make one raise an eyebrow at times. <br /> <br />And you would think that the death of one of the original characters would have merited more print, but no.....it was over and done with in less than a paragragh. =0( <br /> <br />This isn't one of the best books in the series. i strongly recommend \\"The Tale of the Body Thief\\", \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and of course, \\"Interview With The Vampire\\". This book could be dropped from the series all together.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book right after Oprah announced it last September. I (like so many) have alcoholism in my family. This book helped me try to understand what they were going through. I couldn't stop thinking about it. The book's message can be applied  to most any area...there are allot of \\"addictions\\" in this world. James message of \\"hold on' truly rang through. <br /> <br />Please do not let the Smoking Gun article distract you from reading this book. Please don't let that negate the message of this book. This book helped me, my husband, people I gave it to at work (and that's just in my small circle).  <br />Pick up the book, read it with an open mind. It may ring the same message of \\"hope\\" that it did for me for you. <br />
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I may have now watched or listened to this remarkable concert 50 times in the last few months. Like the man it celabrates, it continues to delight me and breath new life into the music of my times. Many on that stage are the rock royalty of the 1960's and onward and they're skills have aged like fine wine.  I had to chuckle when I first had my 15 year old watch it. To see all these old guys on stage, playing with such chemistry and soul and TALENT! And then his one word critique \\" WOW\\".  What more can I add, other then buy it, play it loud and sit back and see how long it takes you to say \\"WOW\\" too.
B00000JG41|5.0|For a band that can't remain in the same genre for an entire song it is not all that odd that each album is different than the one before. It is also telling that an album this eclectic can be called a sellout album. Basically when you go into this album you have to realize what Mr. Bungle is doing, they are dissecting pop. They basically took a bag of the most atrociously stale music you could find (lounge, surf rock, cheesy pop) threw in some metal and a bit of jazz and then turned on the blender. For example in the song \\"Air Conditioned Nightmare,\\" it abruptly changes from beach boy want-to-be surf rock to heavy drum solos and back again. So fare it doesn't sound as through I am giving them a good revue, but everything I have said is why I like the music. As with all Mr. Bungle this album is not for anyone, but I recommend that everybody should at least give it a try.
B000000H4V|5.0|Well the Brazilians have given us many things such as Samba, carnivale and beautiful women, but thats another topic altogether. But they also gave us a great death metal band that included their own mix of tribal, acoustic and thrash with powerful lyrics. Chaos A.D is a very political album that deals with social and economic problems from the opening songs through its tribal song to the end of the live songs. Andreas Kisser has very strong riffs that are a powerful tool that made them one of the most successful and influential bands in metal even though they are not your typical European or American band. Max Cavalera combines the vocal and growling method that give light to anger and hostility, not angst like other people. The songs are mostly songs that describe what government has done to its people and offer stories about people have damaged and destroyed cultures, people's livelihoods and made its own hostile from songs such as Refuse/Resist, War For Territory and Propaganda. Overall, every bit of this album is great, from the double bass drumming skills of Igor Cavalera, who also adds great tribal drumming too, to the powerful music by Andreas,Max, and Paulo's audible bass. Start here if your knew and listen to the entire album with an open mind because you will get hooked.
B000667FN8|1.0|I'm an open minded music listener, but I just can't stand listening to this sh*t. It makes me feel like I'm going to die every time I listen to them. The music is awful and annoying. The vocalist sounds like he has got his balls cut and the rest of the band just don't got any talent at all. My friends and ppl around me always play this crappy music and claimed that, Simple Plan is what punk rock is and \\"Welcome To My Life\\" is punk rock masterpiece (holy sh*t!!!). These guys are just a bunch of posers who had poluted the music world with their whinny music. They don't deserve the word 'punk' and isn't a rock band at all. Simple Plan sucks!!!

0393317552|3.0|This is a good book! Jared Diamond has a nice writing style, and perhaps he wasn't the first one to think about this hypothesis, but he does a great job presenting his arguments in a clear-yet-non-scientific manner.  <br /> <br />I think some people take offense with his position, because in the end, one of his main arguments is that there is no genetic reason why the European cultures have arisen to such power while other cultures haven't. In the end, despite culture, skin color, etc., there really isn't that much physically separating a Blackfeet Indian to a white Wall Street banker to a hunter in Africa.  <br /> <br />Geography obviously plays a significant role in human society. If you are isolated from others (like the Americas and various islands), you are at more a disadvantage when other societies come visit you, bearing knowledge/technologies/bacteria/viruses that have never been encountered by the indigenous peoples. Obviously many societies all over the world have domesticated animals/plants for their own uses. Yet some animals can't be domesticated despite years of human interaction (elephants still kill/harm their trainers and elephants have been used by humans for many centuries) whereas when was the last time you heard a cow killing it's rancher? And remember there are millions of cows vs. thousands of elephants. And cows can do more things reliably than just die for our consumption, pulling plows, carrying heavy goods, etc.  <br /> <br />Cultures that had easy access to ideas/technologies to improve their own lives, to free up time that would otherwise be spent stalking game, digging roots, or tending/harvesting crops. Would Shakespeare have written (allegedly?) so many plays when he had to repeatedly go out to hunt? And hunting/planting/harvesting crops each have their own dangers, from broken bones, accidental injury from tools/weapons, etc. And back in the old days, even minor injuries by today's standards may result in death back then.  <br /> <br />But anyway, I recommend that y'all not only buy, but also get Giorgio Kostantinos-The Quest for a better fate of society read this book! Giorgio does a much better job than Jared in laying out his arguments and a clear, logical, and not-so-eye-glazing way that most people would understand!
B00005A3KS|4.0|A few months ago, a favorite sports writer of  mine (Bill Simmons, AKA the Sports Guy of ESPN.com fame) was lamenting the lack of rewatchable movies coming out of Hollywood over the past  half-decade, and comparing the recent paucity to the abundance of such movies in the 1980's and '90's.  While I'm about ten years younger than the Sports Guy and not given to nostalgia anyway, it wasn't hard for me to see his point. Which brings me to Point Break, one of the quintessential rewatchable movies of the past 20 years.  If I'm flipping through channels and I come to this movie, unless there's a Celtics or Patriots playoff game on, I'm watching.  Period.  It doesn't matter that basic cable is bound to edit some of the best parts, or that I've seen the movie about 15 times already and own the DVD, or that my wife may become even more convinced of my profound patheticness.  I simply can't not watch Point Break if it's on, which can be said about very few movies indeed.  In fact, if I were to create a list of the top ten guy movies I've seen in my life, it would go something like the following:<br /><br />1. Goodfellas<br /><br />2. Road House<br /><br />3. Commando<br /><br />4. True Romance<br /><br />5. Fight Club<br /><br />6. Heat<br /><br />7. The Terminator<br /><br />8. Sin City<br /><br />9. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels<br /><br />10. Swingers<br /><br />However, if were to make a list of the top ELEVEN guy movies I've seen in my lifetime, it's a safe bet that Point Break would sneak onto that list.  Released just before the mid-90's surge of super-advanced special effects that yielded such super-terrible movies as Twister, Independence Day, and pretty much anything involving Jerry Bruckheimer, Point Break is nothing short of B-movie heaven, with all the familiar trappings thereof: rampant overacting, testosterone-laden dialogue, a series of highly implausible occurrences, and men determined to resolve everything with violence.  It's fast-paced, deliriously stupid, and just suspenseful enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen.<br /><br />At the same time, Point Break succeeds because its heart is always in the right place.  Sure, it doesn't have the huge budget and nifty effects that characterized so many of the Hollywood blockbuster released in the past decade or so, but Point Break did manage to boast a plot and characters that were at least somewhat believable and well-developed, to go with lots of skillful direction from Kathryn Bigelow.  And, of course, you get one completely iconic line from Keanu Reeves: \\"I am an EFF-BEE-EYE Agent!\\".  His career was all downhill from that one, let me tell you.<br /><br />Even the name of the hero is likably improbable:  Johnny Utah (!), played in slightly-less-wooden-than-usual fashion by Keanu Reeves in his pre-Speed days.  At the start of the movie, Johhny is a strait-laced FBI rookie and ex-college football star who gets an assignment to the Bureau's robbery unit in the criminal hotbed of LA.  Providing the yin to Johhny's yang (or maybe it's the other way around) is Patrick Swayze's Bodhi (\\"They call him Bodha-Zeffa\\"), a walking bundle of contradictions: a laid-back surfer dude and martial-arts expert who spouts heavy philosophy when he's not leading his gang of ex-president-mask-wearing adrenaline-junkie bank robbers on heists to finance their globetrotting adventures.<br /><br />Naturally, the two are put on a collision course when Johnny and his grizzled partner Angelo Pappas (the great Gary Busey) are assigned to bringing down the ex-presidents and Johnny starts frequenting the local beaches in the guise of a novice surfer.  It's not long before Bodhi and co. (who turn out to be quite fervent college-football fans for a bunch of slacking surfers) take Johnny under their collective wing and introduce him to their thrill-seeking, anti-mainstream worldview.  And it's also not long before Johnny loosens up, falls for a surfer chick, and begins to sympathize with his newcriminal buddies.  That's just the bare bones of the plot though; you also get:<br /><br />-A couple of showdowns with a group of local surf Nazis with names like Bunker and Warchild (one of them played by Anthony Kiedis, who turned out to be a decent actor when he wasn't putting out mediocre albums with the Red Hot Chili Peppers).<br /><br />-Shootouts, fistfights, chases, a gratuitous car explosion, surfing, and skydiving: everything you could want in an action movie, and more!<br /><br />-One of our finest actors (John C. McGinley of Office Space, Platoon, and tons of other movies) as Harp, Johnny's tightly wound and often-screaming FBI supervisor, who's had it with Johnny and Angelo's wild antics and lack of results and isn't afraid to show it.<br /><br />-One of movie history's great bank heist scenes towards the end.  Is there a movie that wouldn't benefit from a tense, closely-filmed robbery sequence with an impending sense of doom, the kind where you know something is going to go wrong and people (both innocent and otherwise) are going to die?  Granted, you don't quite get anything on par with the legendary downtown-LA shootout from Heat, but I was impressed nonetheless.<br /><br />And, yeah, that's pretty much it.  Point Break is not by any means a great movie, but it is a pretty good one, I think, and essential for enthusiasts of mid-budget action flicks.  Sadly, it seems Hollywood isn't churning out movies like this one with anywhere near the regularity it once was, but Point Break should be appreciated all the more for that fact.the bare bones of the plot though; you also get: <br /> <br />-A couple of showdowns with a group of local surf Nazis with names like Bunker and Warchild (one of them played by Anthony Kiedis, who turned out to be a decent actor when he wasn't putting out mediocre albums with the Red Hot Chili Peppers). <br /> <br />-Shootouts, fistfights, chases, a gratuitous car explosion, surfing, and skydiving: everything you could want in an action movie, and more! <br /> <br />-One of our finest actors (John C.

1932100385|5.0|The single most important book ever written on heath and nutrition and the best documented by a life long nutrition specialist.  The evidence is overwhelming for ditching once and for ever ALL meat, dairy, egg, salt, sugar, and processed food!  The best life saving, disease preventing, disease reversing diet is a raw, vegan, organic, unprocessed fruit, vegetable, nut, and seed diet.  DON'T pay any attention to the few one star reviews written by the well known meat, and dairy lobbyists.      You may have seen that the Chief Executive of McDonalds recently dropped dead of a heart attack at the age of 60.  The Wall Street Journal stated in its 4/20/04 cover article on him that: \\"He often boasted about his love of cheeseburgers.\\"  His successor died on 1/16/05 of colorectal cancer at the age of 44.  So much for Atkins!      Please note that if you are a true VEGAN, your chance of dying from the major cause of heart disease or a heart attack is exactly ZERO!  Cholesterol comes from one place only, and that is meat!      Pfizer of course is spending hundreds of millions developing a new drug to raise \\"good cholesterol\\" even though it will most certainly cause liver damage and encourage people to continue their unhealthy eating habits.  If people would see through the unholy collusion between the food and healthcare industries the nations healthcare crisis would be solved!     I personally have been on raw food for 5 years and lost 70 pounds to get to my optimal weight and brought my blood pressure from dangerously high to normal.  I have not had so much as a cold during the entire period, whereas before I went raw and was on the standard American diet, I had at least several illnesses every year.  Also, because of the self regulating nature of \\"living food\\" I have had no problem with keeping my weight where I want it to be.        DID YOU KNOW THAT: Cancer largely comes from the consumption of animal products and that the chance of getting cancer when consuming a raw, organic, unprocessed, vegan diet is about ZERO!    According to the Wall Street Journal dated 7/14/04, the routine side effects of the treatment of choice for cancer, CHEMOTHERAPY are:    Hearing Loss   Heart Damage   Infertility   Brain Damage (cognitive loss)    Some of these side effects can be treated by drugs which cause Liver damage etc. which means that more pernicious drugs will be required to counteract the side affects of the initial drugs and the effect of combining incompatible drugs which can be fatal! Just listen to the TV ads for drugs which say pregnant women shouldn't even handle the drugs as theey might kill the fetus?    So why doesn't the medical establishment tell us that even if a person has cancer it can be reversed and eventually eliminated by simply switching to an unprocessed, organic, raw, vegan diet?  The reason is because they will go out of business if people get healthy, so just like the church for centuries refused to translate the Latin Bible, so the medical, and pharmaceutical, and health care establishments refuse to tell the truth about health and nutrition!  Health and nutrition are not even taught in medical school?    The consumption of animal products doubles the chance of getting alzheimers not to mention MAD COW DISEASE for which there are no cures! Prostate cancer is known as the silent killer in the USA.  Research studies have shown that obesity, and alcohol and red meat consumption are the biggest risk factors for prostate and other types of cancer.  A proper diet as previously described attacks all three of these risk factors. NOTE: 11,000,000 children are on anti-depressant drugs.  The majority of these are under 5 years of age. Tests show that these children are at twice the risk for suicide!  Depression comes from a bad animal based diet, lack of exercise, alcohol consumption and obesity!    Recommended resources:    Hacres.com - excellent health and nutrition info from a Christian perspective.  This site offers compelling evidence of the horror that meat and dairy products wreak on American society.  It also promotes the benefit of raw, \\"living\\" food as the most beneficial and healthful diet.  Why Christians get Sick, by George Malkmus (He cured himself of terminal cancer!) is a highly recommended book as well as God's Way to Ultimate Health.      Other books to read which will change your perspective forever on health and nutrition: Diet for a New America and The Food Revolution, both by John Robbins.  All of this has been rigorously explained and documented in a couple of classic books, The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair, The Hidden Persuaders, by Vance Packard, and Diet for a Small Planet, by Frances Lappe, and more recently in the books, Diet for a New America, and The Food Revolution, by John Robbins, and Fit for Life series of books, by Harvey Diamond, The Hidden Persuaders, by Vance Packard, AND most of all The China Study, by Colin Campbell.

Isaiah 40:31     \\"I have given you every herb (vegetable) bearing seed... and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\\"  Genesis 1:29.  There we have it:  raw, organic, nuts seeds, grains, fruits, and vegetables were God's original provision for mankind before the fall into sin and corruption!  We should try to emulate that for healths  sake.     And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. Deut 34:7     Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:  By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; And patience, experience; and experience, hope: And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.  Romans 5: 1-5.     (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:  Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) Philippians 3:18-19.
B00004YZFR|5.0|The analysis surrounding this greatest by far of all rock films is loopy.  Gimme Shelter, (made pre-MTV), was shot to be a documentary.  The Maysles brothers had unprecedented access and logged stellar concert footage which they combined with insider \\"rockers-on-the-road\\" perspective to create an intimate, accurate portrait. (The Muscle Shoals footage is priceless, especially Keith Richards.)  Even the business side, epitomized by shots of the repulsive Melvin Belli, is effectively revealed.  Refraining from narration was a master stroke, audience members observe and draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />I saw the Stones on their second trip to the States - their ability to generate mayhem-inducing frenzy was obvious even then. Gimme Shelter shows them at the top of their game, and the play list is elite. The problem with Gimme Shelter is that the Maysles brothers didn't know what would happen in Altamont, but they cut the picture together as if they did.  Suddenly the dark undercurrents the Stones dined out on for decades took on a new, and thoroughly unintended, meaning.  That's manipulative and cheap.<br /><br />Back in the day, the Beatles were the nice boys your parents liked, and the Stones were the bad boys they didn't.  At Altamont, we see the bad boy image collide with real evil, and everyone gets confused.  What's so pathetic is how powerless and impotent Jagger looks on stage as he tries to confront the real devil - who has no sympathy for anyone. For those moments he's just a mincing entertainer.<br /><br />As to the twaddle about Altamont slamming the door on '60s idealism, please, it was already collapsing under the weight of its own hypocrisy. In cabbage patches across America, pods were opening at midnight and the first yuppies were being hatched, dreaming of Land Rovers and the invasions necessary to fuel them. You've got shelter, Mick's got shelter, just crank up the volume and enjoy the best live rock footage available.
0099445093|5.0|Stoner is a truly moving work. Its brilliance lies partly in its rectitude, partly in its discomfort and mostly in its artistry. As reviewers have accurately summed, the novel's ultimately about a man's stoicism (which sounds truly boring) and honor, but is really a meditation on individuality.  <br /> <br />As an English teacher I'm encouraged to teach Ethan Frome to the students, and would much rather teach this novel for its depth, complexity and beauty <br /> <br />Please buy, read and pass this book on! (I am a Northerner, not a relative, yet simply a reader!)
B000002UDG|3.0|Hate the cover.   Can you image Lennon or Harrison doing a cheesy cover like this?   Andy Williams maybe.   As for the music.....anyone who doubts that Paul's solo work was inferior to his Beatles work.....remember, this is the musical genius who gave us:    I Saw Her Standing There,  I'll Follow the Sun,  Things we Said Today,   She's a Woman, I've Just Seen a Face,  Eleanor Rigby,  For No One,  Here There and Everywhere,  Paperback Writer,  Fool on the Hill,  Hey Jude,   Back in the USSR,  Blackbird,  I Will,  Why don't we do it in the Road,  Mother Nature's Son,  Helter Skelter,  Get Back,  Let it Be,  Lady Madonna,  and Long and Winding Road.    This is the musical genius who had a voice that could belt out I'm Down and Long Tall Sally.   THAT'S the Paul McCartney who deserved to be in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame without question.   This one?  Not a bad pop song writer, but so was John Denver.  John Denver was probably better than this guy.   And why did they leave off  Maybe I'm Amazed and Hi Hi Hi  ??  They were 2 of his best solo tracks for sure.   I've had my say.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What a joy this movie is!  It's wonderfully funny, romantic, and charming.  I loved it very much.
0553573403|5.0|I began the series on a friend's recommendation: \\"I warn you,\\" I'd said sternly. \\"I am incredibly picky and I hate most fantasy.\\" With the exception of Tolkein (which this series is quite unlike, in fact, being much more character-driven and less epic) I have in fact systematically rejected most of the big names in fantasy (Salvatore, Brooks, Goodkind, Jordan) as simply not literary enough. Martin exceeded my expectations with what has been one of the most enjoyable reading experiences of my twenty-five years.<br /><br />This is a dangerous series to get involved in. At a hefty 1000+ pages each, the volumes are ample enough to satisfy the fast reader but the pacing is quick enough so that the reader never loses interest. In fact, the author so successfully employs suspense that I have found myself crying out or exclaiming more than once during the series. His application of intruigue is intelligent and original, and even the most clever reader will still find a surprise or two amongst these pages. Each chapter is headed with a different character name, and the story rotates among their different perspectives. Rather than be confusing or plodding, Martin's treatment of each individual is unique and full of life. One of the things I respect the most about him as an author (though it makes the reading an occasionally painful experience) is the fact that he's not afraid of killing off a beloved character. This makes those suspenseful moments even more so, as the reader isn't cushioned by the assumption that everything will come out just fine in the end.<br /><br />The world itself is fully-flushed and rich in detail, culture, and history. There is almost no magic when the series begins, as it has been absent since the death of the last dragon several hundred years ago, and when it finally is introduced the events are much more powerful and engaging. What really gives the series its addictive quality, however, is the well-deployed subterfuge and political intrigue. It's like a soap opera for escapists, so consider yourself well-warned; you will tear through the four thousand pages Martin's written so far and weep for more at the end.t's like a soap opera for escapists, so consider yourself well-warned; you will tear through the four thousand pages Martin's written so far and weep for more at the end.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I've been a fan of Robert Plant for years, but I haven't followed his career as closely as some of you other reviewers out there.  A friend of mine suggested that I check out this record and after years of appreciating Robert's songwriting and concept, I was pleasantly surprised that he turned in such an engaging effort.  True artists grow and refine themselves.  I believe that is the natural course for any discipline.    If you are a fan, you will love this album.  If you are an armchair critic, you will rate it low and say ignorant things about it.
B000002B7M|5.0|This is the original recordings of Blizzard of Ozz. Nothing rerecorded like the reissue of this album. This is a true Ozzy album. This is the classic album that made Ozzy a true frontman in metal today. Alot of the classic tunes like Crazy Train, I Don't Know, and Mr. Crowley. Some amazing solos from Randy Rhodes too. He was one of the best. RIP Randy. Any metal head should have this in their collection. If you don't than your an idiot for not. I don't care what you say if you don't like Ozzy or Black Sabbath, than you shouldn't even be listining to metal. The best stuff is on here. I recommend this to any true metal head. Remember get this recording of the album not the reissue one. It might be hard to find but I was able to get my copy. Long live Ozzy.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|**warning, plot details** <br /> <br />Well I finally got to see this film and was pleased.  The film has a great premise.  The story is about these three young men who are traveling through Europe, two of them with one thing in mind, getting some p***y.  Well they got it and more than they asked for.  They are directed to this Hostel in a small town by this strange character who tells them they can get all the girls they want at this Hostel.  Well he wasn't lying about that part.  However he didn't tell them about the fact that they are actually capturing people for this torture game for people with some extra money shall we say.  People pay to go to this facility where they can torture and ultimately kill these people that have been captured.  They even have a price list for different people, Americans bringing the highest amount at $25,000.  I won't tell anymore about the plot.  <br /> <br />The acting was pretty good.  The blood and gore was really over the top.  Although I have to say near the beginning when they show someone with a tool that looks somewhat like giant wire cutters approach this girl tied up in a chair.  Well they show the cutters positioned and then cut away and don't show the actual cut.  My first thought was if this movie is supposed to be so gruesome why wouldn't they show that.  Well they show more gruesome scenes later which still makes me wonder why they cut away on that shot.  Well anyway it did turn out gruesome and bloody.  It did however take about 40 minutes to get to the torture scenes and start getting exciting.  It does turn out to be fairly intense.   <br /> <br />I know because the look of the films are similar that everyone is inclined to compare this to the SAW movies.  They are not really alike after all, but I would give the edge to SAW for one reason.  SAW was more suspenseful and more intense.  That said though I did enjoy Hostel and it will be in my collection of DVD's when it comes out.   <br /> <br />If you liked movieslike SAW, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc, I think you'll like this one too.
B000063DGC|5.0|This is for any true Ozzy fan here. The great Ozzy Osbourne and the great Randy Rhodes on 1 stage to give one of the most rememerable performances in metal today. Some of the best songs on here are including some Sabbath tracks like Paranoid and Iron Man. But alot of good Ozzy songs too like Believer and Crazy Train. I also like the drum solos and the guitar solos. I love to hear solos in concerts especially good guitar solos. This has to be one of the best live albums of all time. You could probably close your eyes and imagine that your in the front row rocking out to Ozzy and Randy live. The best live stuff out there and one of my favorite cd's from the ozz-man himself. Forget those Ozzfest albums. They have nothing on this live album. Long live the legends of metal.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I am brand new to this film and have only seen the director's cut DVD. It was affecting on so many levels. Among many interpretations, Jacques' journey can be seen a moving metaphor of a gay man coming out and finally accepting himself. The loss of his father and his best friend are gut-retching and intensely portrayed. That first scene with Jacques and the dolphins in the tank was so beautifully done and emotionally affecting, then his rescue of the one followed by his night in the ocean with her. Very powerful. While other reviewers see her as charming and cute, Arquette's interpretation of Johana was a bit of \\"fingernail scratching chalkboard\\" for me much of the time. It's too bad she was portrayed as such a predator. I like Jean Reno a lot and enjoyed seeing him in one of his early roles. And Jean-Marc Barr, well, he certainly was wonderful to watch. But more than that, he brought Jacques to life in such a subtle, intensely riveting way. He was so very believeable in his struggles with Enzo, with Johana, and most importantly with himself. He drew you into his character and, for me as a gay man, made Jacques' story mine. Amazing film.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Oh wow was my first reaction when I heard this album. Simply I think The Muse's best album for sure. <br />However, I found it a little bit puzzling that no one noticed the Philip Glass influence in the opening track, Newborn. <br />But given The Muse's penchant for classical music (look at how cleverly they incorporated Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto in Butterflies and Hurricanes on Absolution, right down to the bass riff), I'm not surprised. <br />Whatever you do, get this ablum!!!! <br />
0060934719|4.0|Neil Gaiman knows he's a genius. He wants to show us--everybody--that he's a genius, and he won't stop until he's taken every conceivable genre and tinkers with it until it's molded into a fine, unique specimen of his own creating.<br /><br />His latest genre is simplicity, and even that he manages with a one-of-a-kind finesse. Sure, it's not really a genre per-se, but fairy tales are really tricky things to work off of and, as he says in his acknowledgements, his inspiration came mostly from paintings a friend made, and those--he tells us--were described in part to him over the phone. And with those paintings came the idea to craft Stardust, his new novel about a boy named Tristran Thorne, who by order of the one who stole his heart (metaphorically speaking, of course), walks out of his town of Wall, a town on top of a jut of granite that is divided by a wall (hence the name) from the world of Faerie. Faerie, we are told, has no boundaries, and there are things unseen by the folks of Wall. We learn, as the story progresses, that our character is not merely a hero, but a symbol of actual humanity, and is himself a boy not yet seasoned by adulthood. He instructs himself on the way of his newfound world, on the differences of his surroundings, and--if we are lucky enough--matures beyond his youthful self.<br /><br />Gaiman is a masterful storyteller, though, and it doesn't come through in the way he explains his surrounding, or in the way he illustrates his characters through poetic prose. He communicates his story instead by what every new surrounding, every new adversity, every new obstacle--and his willingness to make these obstacles emotionally dangerous for his characters and, at times, mercilessly violent--does to the characters themselves.<br /><br />And within this all, he deals with hackneyed (and somehow un-extinguished) themes like the longing for eternal youth, the prospect of maturity, the themes of love and loss, and pure, simple growing up. What's most astounding, though, is that he's not bogged down by an overflow of thematic elements. No, he handles everything with a finely tuned pen in hand, and he clearly exercises his patience, and ultimately, we hopefully all see, produces for us a work of fiction worth mentioning. Certainly it's not the best, but in many--if not all--respects, it is a masterpiece by a king of vivid imagination that we should all regard with a cautious eye (because we never know what he will throw at us next) and without expecting to see his works as products of a child's mind. At times he frightens, but always he demands our attention. Neil Gaiman is, without a doubt, a gem to behold.most astounding, though, is that he's not bogged down by an overflow of thematic elements.

6305922756|5.0|Long before \\"A Mighty Wind,\\" \\"Best In Show,\\" and \\"Waiting For Guffman,\\" Christopher Guest was best known for his work in \\"This is Spinal Tap.\\"  Though, Guest did not direct this mockumentary---or \\"rockumentary,\\" if you will, he is brilliant, and wrote this film (along with writing the ORIGINAL rock and roll music) with the wonderful team of Michael Mckean, Harry Shearer and director Rob Reiner.  Incidentally, McKean and Shearer went on to appear with Guest on Saturday Night Live, in the early 1980s, as well as \\"Best in Show\\" and \\"A Mighty Wind\\" (two of the mockumentary/improv trilogies conceptualized by Guest and fellow comedian Eugene Levy).<br /><br />David St. Hubbins (Michael Mckean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) are the trio that make up the fading British heavy metal band, Spinal Tap, chronicled by filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner), and we watch their journey, as they gradually spiral downward into obscurity.  But, let me tell you, it is one hell of a ride.  You are going to laugh so hard, as the actors manage to retain their overaccentuated British accents, over-the-top rock star eccentricities and belt out songs like \\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Hell Hole.\\"  It just goes to show that everyone is entitled to their fifteen minutes of fame (in the words of Andy Warhol).<br /><br />A special bonus, on this DVD, is its wonderful outtakes and feature interviews and previously unreleased music videos.  Spinal Tap actually toured in the 1980s to actual roaring crowds!  Be sure to stick around for the extra footage.  It's quite amusing......

B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is my favorite Ghibli film and my second favorite Miyazaki film next to Cagliostro. Now, on to my beef with the English dub. I usually only watch the english dubs for animes when it is a from a company that I can trust to do a decent job since I prefer it in its native tongue. Disney then decided to give me and my home state, ALABAMA (that's right), a kick in our proudly displayed testicles by changing the american rival Curtis' home from ALABAMA to texas. Texas? By God, man, texas is like a hundred miles away (estimate). In Japanese, Curtis proudly says ALABAMA. But in English, as if no one in the united states knows about the glory of ALABAMA, he says texas. What kind of world do we live in where a Japanese speaking American based character says clearly in a moment of English, ALABAMA, and then a American based company decides to change it to texas. Alphabetically, we are the first state in the Union, so choke on that!
B000BOH8XW|1.0|since the release of Laundry Service, the used to be artist that was known as Shakira has been trying to please American radio by singing in English which til now I CANNOT UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD SHE'S SAYING!! she then released Fijacion Oral Vol.1 with the lead single as La Tortura. F'ing annoying song which makes it even worse when you add Alejandro Sanz to the song. The only thing right shakira probably did was have her song featured on VH1 which was ofcourse La Tortura. Now she decides to release Oral Fixation Vol.2 with the lead single being Don't Bother. So i took shakira's advice and i didn't bother listening to the song. I can't understand what she's saying in the first place. <br /> <br />Gone are the days when Shakira showed real artistry in her music with her first two albums: Piez Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones? These two albums featured kick ass rock, pop, and folk all mixed in together. <br /> <br />All Shakira does now is try and please the masses which doesn't flow for me. Some artists can do it and others can't. How she did it is beyond me and the people who like her WELL BUY HER FIRST 2 ALBUMS AND YOU'LL LOVE EM. but what she's released now is just junk.

B00005NIL9|5.0|I was absolutely shocked from the very first time I heard this album;this has never been done before and still to this very day nothing in the same greatness has come along.I mean this band is tight!Paul Rodgers is the best singer that ever lived, this man has so much soul that he excells in everything he does whether it is Free,Bad Company,The Firm,The Law or even Queen. <br />This album is the definitive Free Album and the best album ever recorded, with classics like \\"Fire and Water\\", \\"Mr. Big\\",\\"All Right Now\\",\\"Heavy Load\\" and many more.It defnitely has a touch of soul,hard rock and even blues to a certain extent!

B0000YWKHC|5.0|Sofia Coppola proves she is a good director and she defines her style in her second movie after the Virgin Suicides. <br />This movie is extremely funny, but at the same time it's an intimate drama. Bill Murray plays a middle aged actor who has lost popularity in America but remains famous in Japan. Which brings him to Tokyo to shoot a 2 million dollard whisky commercial. He feels empty inside, he can't connect to his wife like he used to and is very disapointed at the direction his career has taken in the past years. <br />He meets Scarlett Johanssonw ho plays a 21 year old Yale graduate, married to a photographer(Giovanni Ribisi). She feels lonely, has second thoughts about her marriage and doesn't have a clue as to what to do with her life. They both start an unlikely friendship that develops into love.Tokyo is a fantastic and amazing city that sets the stage for this strange and yet touching love story. I am normally not into romantic films, but Coppola has shown a different and original side of love in this movie, which makes her one of the most talented young directors in Hollywood. <br />
0307276902|5.0|I simply cannot believe that Mr. Frey lied to the reading public. This book, which (3 months ago) I found candid, is now a craftly written novel that dispells readers into thinking it is some most holy memoir. James Frey was a spoiled brat who decided that he was going to ruin his body then make a profit to spite the buyers! I have found respect in the picks of the Oprah Book Club (not the reason I purchased the book) but she should withdraw her badge or at least announce the change to a novel pick. I rate this book five stars because James Frey is a con artist in the worst way and should be an outcast in the world of respectable literature let alone have all of his books remaindered off the shelves and sold at garage sales for the next fifty years. But yourself a drink on me, Mr. Frey, you stole my money
B000002WPI|5.0|In fact it's really not even close. Yeah I know,I know, what about Run D.M.C.?what about Outcast? what about Public Enemy?N.W.A.? And yes all of those rap groups are incredible but this group consisted of 9 M.C's(I believe) and each and every damn one of em could rhyme.To be metaphorical with it, Each one of them brought their own flaver to the gumbo pot.It's hard for me to figure out who my favarite M.C. in the group is because to me, No one M.C. in this group was \\"better\\" then the other(Even though Method Man has by far had the most solo success and recogonition of them all).My favarite M.C'S in the group however are; Inspectah Deak, Gza, Meth, and Reakwon.  <br /> <br />   With all that being said and as much love I have for this group and this album, they honestly might have produced some of the worst Hip Hop beats iv'e ever heard in my life.That's the only criticism iv'e ever had for The Wu, their borderline horrible beats.I mean if they had decent beats to go with their rhymes, do you know how even harder they would be? You gotta take the good W/the bad I guess. <br /> <br />   Lyrically, however this album is masterful.Albums like this are no longer created in todays Hip Hop. This is classic 90's Hip Hop,no gimmics,no commercials,no mainstreams, no overrated gap toothed clowns that got shot 9 times, who beefs with rappers and uses that, rather then his rhyme skill, to his advantage for selling records. Albums like this are the reason why the early to mid 90's were by far and away the greatest erea in Hip Hop history. This is a must by for any real Hip Hop <br />head out their. You'll just have to bare with the beats that's all.  <br />
B0000636UN|4.0|If her eponymous masterpiece was one woman's ride through lives (and highways), \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" is a return to that motif, in a different way: She isn't alone in a car. She's in a star-studded limousine. Stevie Nicks, Emmylou Harris, Don Henley, Natalie Maines, Lenny Kravitz, Gwyneth Paltrow and many more turn up for this album, which is more fun than anything we could have expected of Sheryl Crow. In fact, \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" is tailored for the summer.  <br />\\"Steve McQueen\\" is a killer opener, much like a cork popping out of a champagne bottle. It implies there is lots of fun to be had. Truth be told, as the album goes on, listeners will discovcer that the Sheryl Crow they knew (intellectual, passionate, angry, sorrowful yet humorous etc.) is as active as ever. With as much attitude as she has ever had. <br />Her performances are still soulful, even on the less-than-perfect material (for instance, she is heart-wrenching on a cliche country ballad like \\"It's So Easy\\"). You should hear what the woman does on \\"Safe and Sound\\". As moving and powerful as she has ever managed. <br />\\"Lucky Kid\\" is also amazing, easily the best blend of music, lyrics and vocals she has done. It is edgy, dark, sensual and possessive all the way. <br />Her vocals and music blend wonderfully, but the lyrics aren't always up to par. \\"You're an Original\\" is dynamic commentary on the music industry nowadays, and \\"Weather Channel\\" is breathtaking, but there are a few moments (mercifully few!) that feature redundant and unoriginal verses. <br />Sometimes, \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" sounds like one big song, an explosive summer anthem with ballad interludes. That is not necessarily a bad thing because of how creative and innovative Crow becomes throughout it. It may however seem like no songs are sticking out for listeners. However, listening more carefully proves that the songs are very much unique and that Crow is in top form once again. <br />One big complaint, though. It would be nice to actually hear the guests. You can't actually understand there is anyone but Crow singing in any of the songs. It would be nice to give them more room to party, and, after all, why invite stars, if all you need is back - up singers? <br />All in all, it's an entertaining album by a rock pro and, if you are willing to overlook its sloppy moments, it is definetely a must.  <br />Track highlights: Steve McQueen, Safe and Sound, Lucky kid, Abilene <br />

B000B8QEZG|4.0|If there ever was a performer with a thousand (understatement here) faces, that has to be Madonna. From wild party thing to confrontational songwriter and from sex-obsessed demon to ethereal priestess, it's been one wild ride. After her sloppy but underrated take on political and social commentary (2003's \\"American Life\\"), Madonna is back, trying to put all the pieces together, recreating her party girl attitude through a modern, more intellectual prism. <br />\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is really one big musical piece, (After all, the songs lead into one another), a show full of twists and unexpected turns. Who espected the chant and depth of \\"Isaac\\" after the determined club beat of \\"How High\\"? <br />\\"Confessional\\" is, surprisingly, an accurate term of what you will find here. This is Madonna's testimony as far as her choices, lifestyle and personna are concerned. Sometimes, it is excellent and poetic (e.g. \\"Like It Or Not\\" or \\"Jump\\") Sure, she never opens a vein but well, she never did, except on \\"Like a Prayer\\". <br />However, her confessions can be more than a little self indulgent. For instance, why on earth does anyone ask herself if it was all worth it for the sake of fame when she already has an answer such as \\"I guess I deserve it\\"? <br />That aside, Madonna can still pull off tributes to everyone, from Abba (Hung Up) to Pink Floyd (Intro to \\"Get Together\\") and sound mighty good at it. Her chief ability has always been to make people have a great time and she's never been better at it. \\"Future Lovers\\" is as irresistible as a song can get and \\"Push\\" is insanely, absurdly catchy.  <br />The production is responsible for much of the album's greatness, creating ambient tunes, dance music that carries you wherever Madonna wants you to be carried to. <br />As for her vocal, there isn't much room for a strong take, so mostly she applies her voice in a simple, straightforward manner. <br />Overall, this is a tour-de-force for Madonna, her proof that after all this time, she is still the best there is in pop music. It is also, in a broader sense, an epiphany for the decadent scene of pop nowadays: Good pop music is still alive. People have still got it in them to party. And when it comes to partying, nobody does it better than Madonna. <br />
B00005JO1Y|2.0|Peter Jackson wanted to try to remake King Kong, and it is an exhausting try.  If you wait to see it on Video, you will not have missed anything; the film simply does not work.   <br /> <br />It has lots of homage's to other films: \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Romancing the Stone,\\" \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\\" Unfortunately, all these elements conspire - despite technical advancements - to leave the audience wondering if Peter Jackson has anything original to present.    <br /> <br />O.K., petite blonde starlet learns to love a hairy ape; but so what?  Can their relationship develop into anything meaningful?  Can it be sustained for any length of time?  In the absence of an outside threat, is there anything to hold it together?  Even in the hands of Peter Jackson,  the answer is a resounding \\"No\\".   <br /> <br />The only sense in which their relationship works is when Kong is killing something that is threatening her.  Other than that, there relationship is one of stares.  In scene after plodding scene, Jackson has the gorilla and the starlet look longingly in each other's eyes.  Then they look dewy-eyed some more... One is reminded of the Spinal Tap lyric, \\"And it feels so real, you can feel the feeling...\\"  In a clumsy way this is supposed to suggest a meeting of the souls, but this doesn't work.  One no more senses real chemistry here than when Anakin whined to Padme about his sorry life. <br /> <br />Then there are the unanswered questions:  Setting aside how incontinent Gorillas can be, how long does the starlet plan to spend living in Kong's hand?  How long does Kong think he can run around with his new toy before he breaks her?  Why does the starlet treat her rescuers so ungratefully in trying to save her from a rotten island that, had she'd known better, she never would have traveled to?   <br /> <br />Perhaps sensing that many in his audience are not going to fall for this drivel, Jackson tries to shore-up the film with a parallel plotline that is pure video game. Perhaps the movie's tag line should have been, \\"Come for the Ape, stay for all the other weird jungle crap.\\" <br />    <br />By the time you reach the end of the third hour, you are just hoping the stupid gorilla will be attacked by the planes, and quickly die so you can get back to your life where things move a little faster.  No such luck.  Instead there are more long stares of longing, and a bunch of improbable heroics.   Some has suggested that the film would work better if edited.  I'm not so sure.  Too many millions of dollars are up there on the screen, and if the dragging scenes were tightened, the effects-heavy subplots would become incomprehensible unless whole sequences were chopped out completely. <br /> <br /> In the end \\"beauty\\" doesn't kill the beast; it simply dies of old age, with a tired audience looking on.   <br />

It's nice to have a science fiction pick that has so much depth and relevance. I am really curious to see how this ends. I enjoyed seeing the growth in Tally and her struggle between the world of the \\"smokies\\" and her childhood dreams of being a \\"pretty\\". This is an exciting series and I can't wait to see what happens to Tally and her friends.
B00004BZ16|5.0|<br />December 12, 1980; the world became a much, much better place. <br /> <br />I find it amazing that all this music was written, recorded and released less than a year after they released London Calling. Sandinista! shows that Clash at their creative peak, this album is an onslaught of experimentation and the diversity far surpasses any album I've ever heard, or heard of. <br /> <br />No, I cannot sit and listen to this in its entirety, but I find it hard to listen to any band for two and a half hours. I, personally, prefer the first disc to the second, although they are both incredible. I have tried to make a list of my favourite tracks on here, but its too damn hard and I would end up with a list unsuitably long. Obvioulsy there are the stand out tracks, but every song on here is more than listen worthy. <br /> <br />Many people criticize the Clash for including so many songs and not being more strict with the selection process. But no matter how many songs in between, the great songs still stand out as some of the Clashs best work. And the fact is, the Clash wrote and recorded all this music, and Sandinista! is just a document of that particular time of their career. I think it is great that they included all these songs becasue even the weaker ones are not terrible and still make for an entertaining listen, and I dont believe the album should be thought of as worse just becasue there are some okay songs amungst some brilliant ones.  The best work is still there and to discredit them becasue of the other tracks is merely selling your team instead of sacking some players. <br /> <br />Better than London Calling? It's a tough decision, but I'll have to go with London Calling (as it is probably the best thing I've ever heard), but Sandinista! is definetly the next best thing. After listening to this CD, in my mind, it absolutly confirms that the Clash are, really, 'the only band that matters'. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"SANDINISTA! was the Clash doing to punk what punk did to music in the first place.\\" - The Sandinista Project (sandinista.guterman.com)
B0000024ZT|4.0|I'm a big Springsteen fan and so, of course, I enjoy listening to the album where it all began. But, despite several top notch songs like \\"Lost In The Flood\\", this is far from a perfect Springsteen record. The foremost problem is that Bruce is still in the process of discovering his voice artistically and the lyrics are too derivative of Bob Dylan. Of course, there is no better songwriter to copy than Dylan and Springsteen does manage to evoke his own unique experiences of angst, romance and adventure on the streets of Jersey. But it really isn't until his vastly underappreciated second album, \\"The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle\\" that Bruce achieves the descriptive power necessary to bring the boardwalk and beaches of Asbury Park fully to life. Of course, it was on their all time classic \\"Born To Run\\" that Bruce and the band hit their full stride both musically and lyrically.    Still \\"Greetings From Asbury Park\\" is a fine album, especially on the music side, propelled By Clarence Clemmons' wailing sax and Bruce's catchy hooks and beautiful melodies. There are some weak spots like the draggy ballad \\"Mary Queen of Arkansas\\" and \\"The Angel\\". But these are countered by much stronger upbeat tunes like \\"Growin' Up\\" and \\"Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?\\". The record's best song is the powerful and ambitious \\"Lost In The Flood\\" where Springsteen describes the social turmoil of the early 70's in the form of a soldier, most likely a Vietnam vetern, returning home. This is the first sign of the \\"social protest\\" aspect of Bruce's music which he would return to often, especially on the \\"Ghost Of Tom Joad\\" and \\"Born In the USA\\" albums.    But, for the most part, these are the songs of a younger and more carefree Springsteen. Certainly not his best album. But definitely worth having.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I wish I could leave a great long description but writing is not my thing. The one thing I can tell you is that \\"gay or straight\\" you got to see this movie. It's a beautiful romantic story that ends in tragedy buy that makes you realize that we all need to respect each other and accept that two people of the same gender can fall in love, in genuine love, and they have the same rights as straight people to be happy.  <br />    <br />
B000BHHVPO|4.0|Lets get something straight.  I love music and I bought this DVD to hear all the great acts at Live 8.  That said, how can whoever put this DVD together include 2 performances by Snoop, 2 by Joss Stone, full U2, full Coldplay, etc and only include one song by Green Day???  Green Day clearly stole the show that day, but only American Idiot is included here??? What the #$&@?  Its a great DVD set, but the full Green Day set (including awesome renditions of Holiday, Minorty - the call and repeat with the crowd kicked a$$ -  and We are the Champions should have absolutely been included.  Its a great set nonetheless, but pick up the Berlin DVD...its worth it for the 20 minutes of Green Day magic.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|The first 5 minutes of the film is something to take notice of: It follows the making of a bullet...from the bullet's point of view.  The scenes between Yuri(Nicholas Cage) & Valentine(Ethan Hawke) are very good and, although there is violence in the movie, it is not as often as you would think for a movie like this.  Very intriguing movie.  Jared Leto does a good job too as the younger brother who sees himself as a failur compared to his older brother.  The amazing part is that this is what goes on in the world.  Watch 'Lord of War' and then watch the results of Nicholas Cages' characters 'business' in 'Hotel Rwanda' The 2 films are not directly related but the world of guns and gunrunning play a part in both films.  I agree with another reviewer that the 2 disc edition is kinda cheap looking.  I was disapointed in the extras: a 20 minute making of is not enough for a behind the scenes documentary and Anything TEXT(about the different types of guns) should be stopped because, at least for me, I'm not gonna read pages and pages of text on a DVD about ANYTHING.  DVD is VISUAL! Hello! It's a DVD, not a Book.  Anyone on the fence about getting the 1 or 2 disc I say get the 1 disc cos the 2nd disc is pretty flimsy content wise.
B000002C4J|5.0|Every tune on the album is catchy and romantic and befitting of Celine's voice.  The duets with Streisand and Pavarotti add pleasant timbre to the album as a whole.  Great job by the producers, too, with the mixing and the perfect sequencing of the tracks.
B0009P42S2|4.0|I'm a fan of Akira (as most people reviewing here are) and I enjoyed Steamboy just slightly less.  I've gotten older since I saw Akira, my views on the world are different and animation has changed in that time too.  I thought the animation was gorgeous in this movie but as I was watching it I couldn't help but think it's just not ground breaking.  Of course that's not intended as a criticism.  It's almost impossible to be ground breaking today the way Akira was when it first came out and for several years after.  I love the hand drawn stuff but computer animation loses some of the ability to awe.  That's not a fair assessment however.  Steamboy is a work of art in it's own right.<br /><br />The story moved along at a good pace in my opinion.  It wasn't any slower than Spirited Away or Royal Space Force - Wings of Honneamise.  The slow quiet moments allowed a better appreciation of the beautiful images and animation.  The problem with the story wasn't the pacing but the clich&eacute;d anti-capitalist rants.  It is too simplistic a world view.  The movie wants it both ways.  The overt message is violence and war are wrong while the action is fetishizing that violence.  The battle scenes have a how-cool-is-this look and feel to them.  The artists aren't necessarily trying to see how beautiful they can make war but that's the end result.<br /><br />The underlying themes in this movie are certainly similar to Akira and while I've heard it said this film is more viewer friendly there are still some deeper things going on that are less obvious.  While I thought the anti-capitalist messages were almost niav&eacute; they were still thought provoking (but just a little).  It would be getting carried away to say there was anything more deep and meaningful going on here than comic book philosophy.<br /><br />In the end the movie is gorgeous to look at with a lot of senses numbing action sequences and good entertainment
B000BYA5G4|2.0|I sat there and a 1/2 hours into this movie, I looked at the case and saw that it was about 2 hours long.  <br /> <br />Now you may wonder why I finished watching this movie and the only reason was because, I wanted to see how it ended, but would I run out and buy it, no way. not even for a $1.00 <br /> <br />The only good thing about this movie, was Nicholas Cage, but he was not enough to save this movie.  <br /> <br />So, save your money, unless you enjoy boring movie.

0974872407|5.0|Este es un libro maravilloso. Lo recomiendo a todo aquel que guste de una buena atmosfera gotica, una trama bien construida y un buen estilo. Sin ser una novela policiaca, tiene la atmosfera del thriller. Es un libro lleno de intrigas y misterios. Una vez que lo empiezas, no puedes soltarlo.
B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|So cool- I never thought Yanni would put out a rock album. <br />
B000063Y8F|5.0|I use a lot of garlic and have tried various types of tools for it.  This is by far the best. I even use unpeeled cloves and it still squeezes out the perfect amount of minced garlic.  Cleaning is a breeze--no more poking toothpicks to clean out stuck pieces.  Also, you don't have to be Hercules to get the most of this tool--it requires very little effort.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This was a spur of the moment purchase after I'd read the book Wicked by Gregory Maguire.  I am a fan of Broadway in general, and have loved several cast recordings.  I was a big fan of RENT and was more encouraged to buy this recording when I realized that Idina Menzel, who played Maureen in RENT, was playing Elphaba.  I figured I'd give it a shot and see how I liked it.<br /><br />I cannot express how happy I am I did buy this!  This is an absolutely WONDERFUL recording.  It's easy enough to follow for people who haven't read the book, and it's a great accompanyment for those who have.<br /><br />There are lots of great songs on this album, but a few of my personal favs are What Is This Feeling?, Popular, and Defying Gravity.  They are all great to sing along with as well!<br /><br />I highly recommend this recording to anyone who likes Broadway, likes the tales of Oz, likes Idina Menzel, or just likes to sing along with some fun songs.
B0000033IS|5.0|I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You, what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time. This album released all of the music in Aretha that was screaming to be released. It displayed a very mature Aretha with complex emotions, very everyday lyrics, ones that make you say, oh yeah girl, lol. but also a delivery that the average person couldn't lay down and dream about pulling off. This is just testiment that, even at such a young age, she was THE QUEEN.
B00005JKES|5.0|I was an avid Twin Peaks watcher from the original airing and couldn't wait for this release.  I wasn't totally thrilled with it, as I was hoping for some more extras in there, but it's still got all that crazy odd strangeness to get wrapped up in.  ;)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty cool.  The price is pretty good, too, when you consider you get the entire first season...  Tho if the talk of a reissue from Paramount is true, I might hold out a while longer for that.
1573301051|4.0|I thought that this was a great way to start off a series of shows to save the music. But what most people don't know is that it was an unofficial tribute to Aretha Franklin, as noted by VH-1. And righfully so, Aretha is the original diva. her vocals aren't what they were, but she still delivers in a way that leave you breathless. She dominated the stage. All of the other ladies were good as well, but they lack the confidence that Aretha has, which i'm sure comes from a killer voice and also a lifetime of singing.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Since I purchased Michael's first CD a few years back I have followed his meteoric rise to the top of the charts and it's no small accomplishment for this young handsome crooner. <br />It's Time is a delightful CD. Uptempo or slow and sensual, Michael gives it his smooth voiced best making for a treat for your senses. <br />If asked to pick a few examples of why he is now becoming so revered, I'd say listen closely to the song he co-wrote Home, or how he's injected a new life into Try a little tenderness. <br />Breathtakingly good. <br />The old standard I've got you under my skin is a treat, but then Michael works magic with every song on here. I know I will play this CD over and over and enjoy it more each time.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|Cream is Cream however old they might be. So remember the early days or accept the fact that not many bands can do what they once did. My $0.02 is in the quality of the video recording.  I cannot remember in recent memory another concert video with so many out of focus, erratic, unsteadied, what-am-I-looking-at moments included in the final edit. Shots through Ginger's high hats of Jack Bruce's nose were unremarkable and annoying. The camera often look amateurish as best. My vote is to look away often and just listen to lessen a queasy stomach.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I have been a huge fan of these kinds of movies for quite some time. I just love the gritty style it brings. The raw violence and the thick plotlines. Sin City is an amazing piece of work. Rodriguez brings the comic book to life beautifully and Frank Millers writing of the books is just out of this world. I strongly recommend you see this film. Not recommended for children or persons with weak stomachs though. Cannot wait for Sin City 2. Hope it comes out soon as has the same deliverance as the first one. This new recut edition just had to be made. I don't think I could live with the vanilla edition which I bought in August 2005. Once i saw this edition being released i sold the other one and bought this one. The special features are amazing however the new scenes hardly add anything to the movie. They certianly don't take anything away from the theatrical release. Also, the whole Tarantino as a special guest director is a little ridiculous, although i love all of his other movies. Its clear to figure out the one scene he directed. <br /> <br />Bottom line, this is a fantastic movie. Get out and see it now!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000068IEU|1.0|I'd heard great things about this movie, that it's \\"very disturbing\\" and that it's a \\"classic.\\"  My husband is not a fan of older movies and he needed a little convincing before I was able to get him to watch it with me.  I regretted it not long after the movie began.  This is THE most awful movie I have ever seen.  My husband kept telling me to turn it off, but I kept telling him to wait a bit longer, that the movie will become more interesting.  When the credits rolled, we actually had a fight!
0385338082|5.0|Even before I read this book, I was so excited about reading this book. Prior to reading it, I was just in the process of reading a heavy, dramatic tale and was looking forward for Sophie Kinsella's infectious humour and wit. <br /> <br />And I certainly wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />Right from the word go I was hooked on this book. I shut myself in my room and began the colourful journey of Emma Corrigan in \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" <br /> <br />When the plane Emma is flying on endures severe turbulence she is more that certain she is going to die. On a whim of sheer panic, she semi-sub-consciously splurges all her deepest and most embarrassing secrets - everything from G-strings to virginity - to the guy sitting beside her. To her absolute dismay the very \\"stranger\\" of a guy whom had the pleasure of learning all of Emma's perks, turns out to be none other than Jack Harker - the multi-millionaire boss of the entire company of which she works. Despite this however, a romance blooms between them and they fall for each other. <br /> <br />This tale is endlessly amusing and strongly romantic. There are several particular time throughout when I literally laughed out loud and had to take a spell from reading further so I could control myself!  <br /> <br />For me personally, romantic novels are the opitome of great books  (\\"A Walk to Remember\\" is one of my favourite books ever!), I simply relished in the sweet relationship these two shared. I found Jack to be beautiful character the more I read the more I felt for these two. <br /> <br />Emma, I could also relate to. She's not a particularly brilliant person, but her attributes to fulfill her life are inspiring, but weighed down by the undesirable relationship with her family. I kind of felt as if my own life was being told in some small ways, and I really appreciated that. <br /> <br />Sophie Kinsella takes an ordinary girl and places her in an extraording situation. The result is a funny, delightful, and poignant tale of love and self-acceptance.
B000002HRE|5.0|These songs are what make metallica into what it is now. The best band of all time. The fact is that people cant get over the thrash era. Get over it. Its done its never coming back. This is the new metallica(along with St. Anger) People should either accept it or not by their albums at all any more and quit critizing it, most of whom i can bet have never listened through half the new stuff. <br /> <br />Songs  that shine in this album, <br /> <br />Fuel <br />memory remains <br />Devil Dance <br />Unforgiven II <br />Bad Seed <br />Low Mans Lyric <br />Where the whild things are. <br />Fixxxer.  <br />
B000002J09|3.0|What can be said that hasn't been said about LED ZEPPELIN IV, or in some circles called ZOSO.  Classic rock radio stations play the whole album on their playlists, it contains their best known song \\"STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN,\\" has been the template for every hard rock band ever since, excluding Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, of course, and is hailed, by some anyway, as the greatest rock album of all time.  The three-star rating is my be judging all of their albums, not that I don't love it, but PHYSICAL GRAFITTI and PRESENCE being my personal favorites. <br /> <br />BLACK DOG--A classic hard rock song with Page's immortal riff and Plant's banshee of a voice.  Plant has said this is just one of your typical \\"doing it in the bath\\" type of songs.  4/5 <br /> <br />ROCK AND ROLL--It's hard not to listen to this and not be pumped, dancing around and singing the lyrics.  4/5 <br /> <br />THE BATTLE OF EVERMORE--One of the three favorite songs of mine on the album.  Haunting, mysterious and beautiful.  You feel like you're on some type of drug listening to this song.  Lots of folk instruments on here, including Page's beautiful acoustic playing.  Vocal duties are handled by Plant and the lovely Sandy Denny (from the underrated Fairport Convention, the band that unleashed guitar whiz Richard Thompson on the world).  I usually put this song on when I'm lying in bed.  5/5 <br /> <br />STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN--Ah, Stairway.  The song yelled out by audience members all around the world for whatever band is on stage.  The song Wayne Campbell was about to play before the music store salesman pointed at the \\"NO STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN\\" sign.  The song that Robert Plant allegedly hated.  It may be hard to believe, but I didn't hear \\"Stairway\\" for four years after I discovered Led Zeppelin (the first Zeppelin albums I owned were III and PHYSICAL GRAFITTI).  I didn't even know who it was when I heard it on the radio for the first time, resulting in laughter from my friends.  Still a great song, evenafter the countless times I've heard it.  4/5 <br /> <br />MISTY MOUNTAIN HOP--Another personal favorite.  The bouncy groove, Page and Plant's call-and-response vocals and guitars.  All backed up by a solid foundation layed down by Bonham's drums and Jones' bass.  Fantastic!!  5/5 <br /> <br />FOUR STICKS--A little weird, but I love the intro, a somewhat dark song.  3/5 <br /> <br />GOING TO CALIFORNIA--More great acoustic playing from Page.  Rumor has it that Pearl Jam's \\"Learning to Fly\\" is an homage to this song.  3/5 <br /> <br />WHEN THE LEVEE BREAKS--My definite #1 song on this album.  That drum intro just does it for me.  The ghostly harmonica solos on here just add so much depth and Plant's singing is in top form on this song as well as Page's guitar playing.  5/5
0060930187|5.0|The brilliance of The Bell Jar is the realistic way Plath tells Esther's story and the interconnectedness of the elements of her madness. The first statement Esther makes to her reader is how sick she gets at the thought of being electrocuted. Later, after she comes more undone mentally, she goes through electric shock therapy and, hearing a story about a man who was saved from a suicide attempt, she becomes obsessed with thoughts of suicide. She emerges from her madness and self-destructive thoughts after her friend hangs herself. Yet throughout her experience with madness the fear of going through shock therapy drives her to the brink of suicide.  <br /> Plath describes madness to feel as if one is under a bell jar. Esther implies the suffocating sensation when she says that wherever she goes, whether to Europe or Asia or the moon, that she will always \\"be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in [her] own sour air.\\" Esther knows that something is not right inside of her, and she knows that it is worse to be afflicted in the mind than in the body, but she is hindered in her ability to communicate or even catalogue her own issues.  <br /> The most tragic element of The Bell Jar is how closely it parallels Plath's own experience. Plath went through a traumatic experience with electric shock therapy and did eventually end her own life at the age of thirty. The characters seem to closely relate to her family members, as Plath had an overbearing mother like Esther's and lost her father, a European insect expert, at a young age. Sadly, it seems that the realistic nature of Plath's first novel was wrought from her own plunge into madness, yet Plath did not meet the same end as her character.
B000028U0Y|5.0|One thing that you had to admire about Cash was that he never forgot his roots. He knew inside that he had his trouble making days and that he was misunderstood like most of the prisoners at Folsom. Certainly that was why many of the residents of Folsom wrote Cash letters saying how his music made them feel free and at peace. The prisoners felt they had a friend whenever they would listen to a Cash record or hear him on the radio. Cash then did something that was unthinkable back then (probably would be unthinkable today even): He took his guitar, his backing band, and June with him to Folsom to cut \\"At Folsom Prison,\\" likely the album that sent him from great country artist to legendary. <br /> <br />CBS was dead set on cutting this album, and they let Cash know this. However, Cash couldn't lie to himself that these prisoners had more in common with him than most people; they could relate to each other in a way Cash couldn't with many others. That was why he gladly accepted the offer to perform there when he received the request. Many recounts of the event let us know that Cash thought this as his most receptive and involved audience in his performing history, and one listen to the album lets you know that there is truth to what Cash says. <br /> <br />The album is typical of Cash: deep baratone vocals, followed by his guitar strumming, and his usual bantar with June and the backup band. What makes this album different, though, is the spirit. The prisoners are involved, clapping and stomping along, singing to the songs like arena rock lovers in the 70's-80's did. You sense that for the short time that Cash performed, these prisoners felt bliss and enjoyment. You almost forget when listening to this album that these ARE prisoners; these men broke the law and some were in fact dangerous. The album shines on a realization: prisoners are human beings; they have interest in music, especially music that speaks to them, like Cash did. I enjoyed the interaction Cash made with the men, and you can tell they did as well. For the short time this concert lasted, you could see that these men might have had good intentions inside, and needed someone like Johnny Cash to bring them out. <br /> <br />The album is raw and real. The sound effects and the performing actually took place at the prison. There wasn't editing done or special effects to make it sound like it took place at the prison when it really took place at CBS studios. The singing, performing, interaction, everything was 100% pure. And it all went without a hitch; Cash performed, and they loved it.  <br /> <br />If you are huge Johnny Cash fan, you probably already have this album. If you aren't, I highly recommend adding this album to your collection, as it is one of the most renowned albums in history. In all likelihood, the best live album in the country music genre, if not the best live album in ALL music genres.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This movie was one for the collection. The directors vision along with the story line makes for an intreaging and provocative movie. A+
B00003CXXO|3.0|I just finished (a few hours ago) watching this movie.  As some others have said (more eloquently and informatively), it is an odd mixture of brilliance and sappy Spielbergian \\"E.T.\\"-ishness.  I would like to point out something I'm not sure anyone else has noticed (of course, I've read only a very few of the over 1000 reviews of the movie here at Amazon), and that is that the love that David supposedly felt for his mother (and, I thought the initial claim in the movie was that the child-robot would \\"imprint\\" his love on BOTH his \\"adoptive\\" parents) was not FREELY MADE by him - it was something his creators BUILT INTO his being.  And it is here that any possible comparison to the story of God's creating Adam and Eve fails:  God created Adam and Eve with FREE WILL, since it is only by exercising FREE will that GENUINE love can exist.  In the movie, did David at any time love his mother (or anyone) OF HIS OWN FREE WILL?  No.  Thus, he was not, and never became, a real boy, since he could never love FREELY.  Which makes the whole movie pretty much moot, though flashy. <br /> <br />Perhaps next time, in a hypothetical sequel, David can seek salvation from the \\"Blue-Tooth\\" Fairy.  No strings attached.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|When I sat down to watch this I had no idea what it was about. And it does not take long to find out. We start off with two men chain to opposite sides of a very grimy and disgusting large bathroom. In between them is the body of a man that shot himself in the head. The corpse has a gun in one hand and a tape player in the other. Everything just out of the two men's reach. And then the game begins; they each find an envelope in their pocket with tapes in them. And all they have is a hacksaw each that would never cut through the chains they wear. <br /> <br />Then we watch as the story unfolds. The two victims figure out that an ingenious serial killer known as the jigsaw killer placed them there. This plot was well thought out. And the killer has left them no choice. They have to get out our pay the consequences.  <br /> <br />I do not know what those other reviewers are talking about. This is the first movie in a long time that I did not figure out who the killer was until they let us know. And I was surprised. This movie is worth watching. See if you can figure out who the killer is. <br />
1594200696|5.0|______________________________________________<br /><br />The Strunk & White classic, in a classy new hardbound edition, with sprightly illustrations by Maira Kalman. The book designer is uncredited, more's the pity, since it's very nicely laid out.<br /><br />Ten million customers can't be wrong, and millions of writers would write better by heeding these simple rules: Write clearly. Be brief. Never call a spade an agricultural implement. Revise, shorten, proofread! Sergeant Strunk snaps his orders to the recruits.<br /><br />I've worn out a couple of copies of this. One could quibble with some of Sergeant Strunk's and Corporal White's marching orders, but considering that the junior author has been dead for twenty years, their little book is holding up remarkably well.<br /><br />Happy writing--<br />Peter D. Tillman
B00005JO04|1.0|I want a refund. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years. For one thing, it has NOTHING to do with the book it claims to be based on. The book, \\"See No Evil\\",  unabashedly blames many of our current intelligence woes on the Clinton administration. The movie tries to make the political statement that a bunch of yahoo Texas wildcatters are the puppeteers pulling the strings of the United States Government.  <br /> <br />Not only is it a bad, fictional re-write of a compelling real-life book, but it is terrible entertainment. There is absolutely no reason for Matt Damon's character, or his family to exist. His character doesn't have any affect on the outcome of anything that happens in the movie. <br /> <br />Read the book....skip the movie.
0060234814|5.0|I've had this story in my life since I was a child. In high school c.s.lewis' books were required reading but fun for me. I purchased a copy of the book with my first paycheck. The copy was loaned to my best friend when she had children and has passed down 2 generations with her children. I wanted a new copy to start with my grandchildren, so purchased this copy. A wonderful story for all ages.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved the TV series, and this film was a fitting cinematic production for it.  In many ways, it felt like an extended length episode--it retained the intimacy, humor and, of course, the action of the show--without losing its sense of proportion.  Beautifully done and a joy to watch, whether you've seen the series or not.<br /><br />Now please: BRING BACK THE SHOW...or at least make more movies!
6305428352|5.0|This movie blew me away.  I was not expecting it to be as it was. I would recommend this movie to everyone especially with schools cutting out Music Appreciation in their studies. No one else could be convincing in the role on Mr. Holland.  I love Richard Dreyfuss!!!!!
B000007SPT|5.0|Stone's review is so wrong and he obviously has no idea about what he's talking about. This album is incredible and not intended to be DCD-centered, but a cumulative production by master 4AD producer Ivo Watts. Stone's lack of appreciation for the broad spectrum of the label's artists and Watts' central role only proves his own lack of ability to learn more than what he thinks he knows, like an ADD-diagnosed teenager decorating his room with plastic skulls.
0060516070|4.0|What a wonderful book! I read it soon after reading Walter Pidgeon's book entitled The Not-For-Profit CEO, and I thought it really added to it. Pidgeon touched upon what it takes to be successful as a CEO, and the author here tells us in a narrative format comprising of 192 pages how to be effective/successful. I recommend this book to anyone who is responsible for leading a sole proprietorship, a small business, a nonprofit, a department in a for-profit, or a large for-profit. In short, I recommend it for an executive/leader.<br /><br />Most, if not all, of the points in this book are obvious. No rocket science here. The five main points I got from the book are that a leader must:<br /><br />1. Understand what she was hired to do and do it<br /><br />2. Stick to doing things that add value<br /><br />3. Play on her strengths, and don't worry too much about her weaknesses<br /><br />4. Strategize, plan, prioritize and focus<br /><br />5. Lead by making rational decisions based on fact rather than opinion<br /><br />A leader or executive is someone whose work requires tasks of his or her head. He or she does knowledge work. The author states that other workers do tasks of the legs that amount to physical or manual work. He points out time and time again that performing knowledge work is hard to do and still be effective at doing it. A leader who keeps the above five points in mind when doing her work will do it effectively. She will be achieving results - not merely appearing to be busy.<br /><br />I had a few problems with the book even though I liked it. One is that it is dated. At page 139 the author states \\"Decisions are made by men.\\" If this were an isolated incident of focusing on men to the exclusion of women, then I would have let it slide. However, there are numerous references indicating that the book was written as though only men are leaders/executives.<br /><br />Another problem I had with the book was that the author was telling the reader what he thinks it takes to be \\"effective,\\" and the organization of his book was not all that effective in making his points. The narrative format dragged out the message. I would like to have seen a better introduction as to what to expect from the book. I would have liked the main body of the book to be structured more in an outline style. And I would have liked a conclusion that reiterated the introduction and tied the main body of the book together. He failed to do this in my opinion.<br /><br />Early in the book the author tells us that being an effective executive must to be learned. Well, ok - now tell me something I don't know. There was no need to talk about the need for learning - everything a person does has to be learned at some time or another.

I would have liked the main body of the book to be structured more in an outline style. And I would have liked a conclusion that reiterated the introduction and tied the main body of the book together. He failed to do this in my opinion. <br /> <br />Early in the book the author tells us that being an effective executive must to be learned. Well, ok - now tell me something I don't know. There was no need to talk about the need for learning - everything a person does has to be learned at some time or another.

B0000508UN|5.0|Greetings, this is the first great Grant Green CD I've rated and it is great. I recall once I recorded a song off of the radio by Grant Green but, all this time I always wondered what that awsome song was. So, I was scouting around trying to find out what that song was and I came across this CD and I found the song and the perfect CD I was looking for. The song was Time To Remember, and the CD was Grant Green \\"Alive\\". Bingo, I knew right then that I found the perfect CD to have at last. And I will say this. Grant Green is best of the best.
B00005JOFO|5.0|In my opition, of all the films I know of in this decade, so far, Brokeback Mountain is THE film of the decade! It has so much going for it: great direction, suburb cast, beautiful camera work, superior script, excellent casting; but above all is the way this motion picture treats the theme of love. Love found, almost by accident, love lost, love rediscovered.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|We have decided to only rate Amazon movies from now on that are either GREAT on one extreme or HORRIBLE on the other.<br /><br />Brothers Grimm had a great premise, great sets, etc...<br /><br />The ingredients seemed right but the movie was OH SO PAINFUL AND ANNOYING TO WATCH..... very deadpan humor, stiff acting, silly Jerry Lewis slapstick comedy..... just overall a dreadfully painful movie experience to sit thru.<br /><br />My wife and the guests we had over for movie night all agreed this movie got a \\"D\\" on the normal grading scale.
B00005MCWZ|5.0|Only reason I'm giving this CD reissue a five star-rating instead of a four-star one, is BECAUSE of the superbly done remastered pressing of this title, Hawkwind's debut 1970 lp. Every cut here is totally awesome sounding! From the trippy opener \\"Hurry On Sundown\\" to the rocker \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Mirror Of Illusion\\", the pre-Hawkwind blues cover \\"Bring It On Home\\" and their Pink Floyd cover of \\"Cymbaline\\". Now THAT'S class! You get the lp's seven original tracks remastered, plus four (4 )bonus cuts. Do keep in mind this record was produced by Pretty Things guitarist Dick Taylor, plus it's got some charter HW members that are rarely heard from anymore, like Dik Mik on electronics and Terry Ollis on drums. I've always thought as Hawkwind as being 'sort of' Floyd's rival. Listen for yourself and YOU tell me. First rate psychedelia, space rock or head music. Pick up a copy and you decide. Most highly recommended.
B000AYQLX6|4.0|For a long time I avoided John Lennon's 5th solo album Walls and Bridges based on the bad reviews I had read. It seemed to me that Lennon's solo career peaked early with the twin classics of John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine. That's probably true, but that doesn't mean that Lennon's other solo albums are complete garbage. Quite the opposite, in fact. With the advent of the remastered/reissued Walls and Bridges, I finally checked it out with the rationale that mediocre Lennon is better than no Lennon at all. The mere fact that there will never be another John Lennon album makes anything he recorded all the more significant.  <br /> <br />I found Walls and Bridges to be a complete delight. It certainly doesn't compare to Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, but it's a fine record that deserves some respect. Walls and Bridges moves back and forth between two extremes. On one hand it features bright, upbeat pop songs such as the two most well-known tracks, \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" and \\"#9 Dream\\". There is also morose, sometimes angry introspection such as \\"Scared\\", \\"Steel and Glass\\" and \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out\\". The latter being probably my favorite song on the album. However, even the most upbeat songs have a tinge of melancholy. This was certainly understandable since the album was recorded during Lennon's \\"lost weekend\\" period when he was separated from Yoko Ono. Like most of John's material the emotional ups and downs are glossed over with pop melodies and production. Really my only criticism of the album is that it's a bit too produced.     Several of the songs would be a lot more effective if the sound   was more stripped-down and the instrumentation more sparse.  Particularly \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out)\\", a great song buried under excess instruments and production. John seemed to be trying to replicated Phil Spector's wall-of-sound production possibly to ensure that the album sounded commercial enough to be a viable hit. It must have worked because \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" was John's first solo number one hit. <br /> <br />Still, Walls and Bridges is a fantastic album with good songs, good music, good vocals from John and four or five really memorable songs. Even the weaker songs I find to be enjoyable and worthwhile though. I would recommend the album to Lennon fans who are already familiar with his solo work. Not particularly to new fans. You should get Plastic Ono Band and Imagine (and possibly Double Fantasy) first. Then move on to Mind Games, Walls and Bridges and Rock 'N Roll. Those middle three albums may not be classic, but they are very worthwhile and deserve to be heard by anyone with a serious interest in John Lennon's music.  <br /> <br />The remaster is very good too. The sound quality is excellent and the booklet features complete lyrics and musician credits for every song. The bonus tracks are quite nice. The live version of \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" is notable as being Lennon's last appearance on stage. I really like the acoustic demo of \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out)\\" and wish the final album version had been presented in a similar manner.
B000654Z2I|4.0|Originally released in 1971, as 'Tago Mago' was Can's third lp. Sort of a ground-breaking piece of German progressive kraut, plus it's a double album on CD reissue. Seven tracks, duration of 73:l5. Was never even aware Can had released a double lp, until now. About every single cut is awesome, yet differ a bit from the others, I thought. Might even take a couple of plays for this title to fully grow on you. Several richly performed epics here, like the 18-minute \\"Halleluhwah\\" and the 11-minute \\"Peking O\\". Also totally dug the brilliantly played opener \\"Paperhouse\\" as well as the upbeat \\"Mushroom\\". Believe this was vocalist Damo Suzuki's second lp with Can. Of course, I mean this being their third effort and all. An absolute must-have.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|There hasn't been a lot of progressive pop in the last couple of decades dominated by mainstream pop and angrier strains of rock and rap. So this album, and perhaps Sigur Ros' TAKK, can serve the purpose of turning popsters onto art-rock that requires more than a cursory listen and bad attitude, man.        What makes \\"pop\\" become \\"progressive pop\\"? That's simple-- complexity in music and lyrics. The minute the arrangements shatter pop conventions (verse chorus verse chorus solo chorus chorus fade) and create a sense of adventure both aurally and lyrically, you are into the realm of progrock, art rock, or whatever you want to call it.   Think of everything from Brian Wilson's 1966-67 Beach Boys-era SMiLE to Mike Oldfield's 1978 epic INCANTATIONS and you'll have covered over a decade of popularity for the genre.  There tends to be a sharp contrast between more complex upbeat sections and quieter segments, and lengthier instrumental passages than is allowed in mainstream pop. Sufjan Stevens twist on the genre is his gentle folkie vocals, although even early Gabriel-era Genesis would seem to be a precedent. Instrumentally, he plays a ton of instruments a la Mike Oldfield, but in the service of his pop opera ILLINOIS rather than Oldfield's instrumental explorations. His love of complex vocal arrangements and atmospheric orchestral interludes puts him closer to the Brian Wilson SMiLE end of the prog spectrum than the mainstay progrockers (YES, ELP, etc) preference for lengthy instrumental segments.  That genre tended to rely on unusual guitar sounds and then-cutting edge technology in synthesizers for its textures, while Stevens prefers to use a self-made chamber orchestra to colour his work with endless details to soak up with each repeated listening.  At times he even uses multi-layered vocal sections a la YES in their \\"And You And I\\" mode.  Some have even dubbed his music \\"chamber-folk\\" as a spin on the art-rock label. That probably gets as close as anything I have heard in terms of describing this excellent work, although even comparisons to musical theatre have been credibly offered (indeed, I can see the theatre producers lining up already to arrange this for the stage). Chalk all this mania up to musically-starved pop writers if you want, but I think the work is worth the buzz.  I do not make these comparisons to draw away from Stevens originality (for instance, his use of minimalism, especially in the closing finale, is groundbreaking for anything even remotely associated with folk music that I have heard), but simply to help people who appreciate these genres feel confident about buying his album. Sufjan Stevens is a great folk singer and great prog arranger, and that just about says it all.           There are a ton of lyrics on this 75 minute album, which makes it wonderful for secondary research, especially given all the historical allusions. Another hallmark of progressive rock is the in-depth explorations of spirituality, history, myth, and other topics that can't be contained in a chorus or three minute ditty. Hence, the birth of the concept album; and Stevens takes this idea to the logically absurd conclusion that he wants to do a concept album for every state in the union!  That's one of the things I love about him-- whether you are talking about his music, his lyrics, his song titles, and even his future ambitions, he throws every reviled thing about progressive music right back at you and seems to pull it off. The more you get into the lyrics on ILLINOIS, the more you want to know about the stories and history behind them and their laugh-out-loud titles.  There is a bubbly enthusiasm that Stevens conveys when he sings his Christian imagery-laced lyrics (his SEVEN SWANS album was awash in Christian spirituality), which is made particularly ironic when he sings about someone in love with a dying cancer patient: \\"Tuesday night at the Bible study/ We lift our hands and pray over your body/ But nothing ever happens.\\"Not exactly the words of a patsy for the phony televangelists.          As for individual songs on ILLINOIS, there is simply too much that can be said to really get into it.  Briefly, there are the truly offbeat numbers (\\"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois,\\" \\"Out of Egypt, into the Great Laugh of Mankind...\\"), the comparatively straightforward folkie songs (John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\", \\"Casimir Pulaski Day,\\"), and the certifiably progish numbers that are so well arranged and sung they give me chills (the incredible \\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!\\", \\"Come on Feel the Illinoise!\\",  and \\"The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders'). And there isn't  even one mediocre song let alone a clunker on the whole album.          It seems perfectly obvious to me that Sufjan Stevens is on the brink of becoming one of America's most important composers.  Why miss any of the fun while the rest of the country figures this out--- pick up the CD today!   -=== om=-=-=- Nick (SoulQuest7@aol.com)
B0000VD04M|5.0|Nutty, wonderful movie. Johnny Depp even looks hot in girls clothing, I LOVE IT. This movie is funny and one you have to see, Tim Burton did a wonderful job as usual with some amazing actors by his side. If you haven't seen it yet, it should be a sin. You gotta get this movie as soon as possible; buy it now. Why would you want to ever miss Johnny Depp in any one of his movies?!?!
B000B0QOJA|5.0|<br /> <br />The CD set begins with Garrison playing the tail-end of a bass solo. Then Coltrane begins a frenetic solo of unbearable intensity. The solo lasts all of 28 minutes.  <br /> <br />This sort of intensity is almost unbelieveable. It should be physically impossible to solo for as long as this, at this level of ferocity. It almost makes your jaws ache to hear him. Coltrane clearly thought this solo was amongst his best; several copies of it were discovered in his possession upon his death, many of which had been distributed amongst his fellow saxophonists. The solo \\"One Down One Up\\" gained legendary status just after Coltrane's death, with many saxophonists using it as a model. <br /> <br /> <br />Yet until now no legal version of the solo has been released. Technically this is not a \\"rediscovery\\". Unlike the Monk at Carnegie Hall concert, these tapes have always existed. But releasing it at this time allows us to hear the opposite end of Coltrane's development - the hard-bopper playing \\"Monk's Mood\\" in 1957 has been replaced by a frenetic avant-gardist, playing the most fierce music in all jazz. <br /> <br />The only complete track on this album is Song of Praise. The slow rubato ballad from the album \\"The John Coltrane Quartet Plays\\" is here reinvented as a ferocious solo that somehow never loses sight of its emotional roots.  <br /> <br />Afro Blue and My Favorite Things are agonising to listen to, cut off before their prime, with Coltrane soloing demonically at the fade-out. They both would have been remarkable documents if they were complete; incomplete we are left wondering how on earth Coltrane intended to bring the wild soloing back to the pre-composed conclusions that are so familiar from previous albums. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"One Down One Up\\" is a release to be approached cautiously. Someone new to Coltrane would be well advised to steer clear. If you really want to hear the title tracks, both the other two versions are easier on the ear and arepretty exciting too.  <br /> <br />If you like a challenge, however, and want some of the fiercest music on the planet, buy this.
0792164903|5.0|I loved it. Incabod Crane is actually supposed to be not-so-good looking man but thats hard to do when Johnny Depp is in that role. I loved it from start to finish and it's a great film to watch on cloudy days.....heck, evereyday. Buy it, I loved it!!! (Johnny is great as usual!)

B0001CCXZW|5.0|Nothing anyone can say or write could capture the wonder and perfection of Gilmore Girls on television. It's the smartest show I've ever seen with all kinds of funny references flying out of everyone's mouth every 10 seconds. The communication between characters is so amazing you'll be addicted to Gilmore Girls by the time in the first episode when you see Lorelai begging for a cup of coffee from Luke at his diner. The first thing we learn about the Gilmore Girls is that Lorelai can not function with out coffee. What show would take a risk to talk about coffee in the first few minutes? Gilmore Girls would. When you're watching the show one can only marvel at how fast they are talking. It must be really hard to talk that fast but, it is so amazing. It makes the show what it is. No one can imagine Gilmore Girls with out the fast paced talking in the dialoge.  <br />So, the First Season of Gilmore Girls is where it all starts. Lorelai is running the Independance Inn with Head Chef Sookie by her side, and rude French Michel answering the phone (hopefully). But, Lorelai and Sookie's dream is to someday open a Inn of their own (Hence Season 4). Rory is very smart and has big plans for her future. She wants to go to Harvard and become a journalist. So, she and Lorelai who wants the same for her, are estatic when a letter of acceptance comes from Chilton for Rory. They see Chilton as one step closer for Rory to achieve her dream. The only problem standing in the way of achieving that dream is money. Something Lorelai doesn't have that much of to give to the school for Rory's tuition. So, she comes to the painful last resort of asking her parents who she doesn't have very much of a relationship with for money. They agree but, with the Gilmore's there are always strings attatched. The Gilmore Girls have to start coming over for Friday night dinners. Suddenly Rory's Grandparents are a part of their lives something that Lorelai is not very happy about. But, allows it anyway sothey will pay for Rory's school. This season is also where Lorelai meets Max (One of Rory's Chilton teachers)! Also, Rory gets her first ever boyfriend, Dean in Season One. A boyfriend that Lorelai actually likes. As Lorelai puts it, \\"The best first boyfriend you could ever have.\\" (Personally, although other people might have other opinions I don't like Dean that much mainly because of what he did in Season 4.) In this season we also, get introduced to Christopher, Rory's father. I think the writers tried to leave a feeling with Christopher that maybe someday he and Lorelai could have a future. But, anybody who is a true Gilmore fan knows that Luke and Lorelai are meant to be together. I will be so mad if in the end they are not together and instead it's Christopher!! <br /> <br />Pilot: Rory is accepted to the elite Chilton prep school. Bad news for Lorelai: she must make amends with her parents to borrow the money for Rory's tuition. The money is available - with strings attatched. <br /> <br />The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton: YOu get extra pints if you sing the school song - in Latin. Chilton isn't a place where cutoffs and cowboy boots are the fashion. But, that's what Lorelai hurriedly throws on to accompany Rory to the posh school. <br /> <br />Kill Me Now: Rory takes up golf to fulfill a school athletic requirement and, to Lorelai's dismay, grows fond of her Grandfather when he takes her to his country club for a day on the links. The Inn staff prepares for a double wedding involving identical sets of twins. <br /> <br />The Deer-Hunters: Not buying \\"the dog ate my homework?\\" Try \\"a deer struck my car.\\" Rory's mishap en route to Chilton causes her to miss a Shakespeare exam, and the consequences could be disastrous for her GPA. <br /> <br />Cinnamon's Wake: Must be love. Or at least a very strong like. Rory acts awkwardly around Dean. ANd the death of Morey and Babette's beloved cat brings the whole Stars Hollow town together for a memorial. Just picture it. You're town going to a cat's funeral. <br /> <br />Rory's Birthday Parties: What a difference a day makes. The swanky birthday celebration Emily hosts is a freaky Friday for Rory. Emily invited all of Chilton without even asking Rory! But, Lorelai's Saturday party is way cool - not counting the big blowup between Lorelai and Emily. Emily finally realizes  that she doesn't know anything about her daughter. <br /> <br />Kiss and Tell: Right there is Doose's Market: Dean and Rory kiss. Everyone in town seems to know about it. Everyone, that is, except Lorelai, and she's a little weirded out because Rory didn't tell her.  <br /> <br />Love & War & Snow: Rory's out of town. The first snowfall of the year blankets Stars Hollow. We learn of Lorelai's love hate relationship with snow. Mostly it's love in this season. And Lorelai invites Max into her home after their spectacular first date. One problem: an unexpected gues is there....Lane.  <br /> <br />Rory's Dance: Events at Chilton's formal dance convince Rory and Dean that they, as Rory might say, are very boyfriendy-girlfriendy. Dean stands up for Rory to Tristin. But, something unexpected happens that sets the town buzzing and puts Lorelai in a motherly frenzy of concern. <br /> <br />Forgiveness and Stuff: If the holidays can't patch up some of Emily and Lorelai's differences, perhaps a medical emergency can. While Lorelai is overcoming the overwhelming fact that her father is in the hospital Luke drives her over and gives Emily the wrong impression about them.  <br /> <br />Paris is Burning: A very-Lorelai moment during the Chilton Parents Day crystallizes her misgivings about her relationship with Rory's teacher Max. Paris accepts Rory's offer of friendship...sort of...kindof...well, maybe. <br /> <br />Double Date: On the front lines of the dating wars! Lorelai ends up with a horribly rude blind date that thinks she's too tall for him. This happens when Lorelai agrees to go on a double date with Sookie and Jackson. And Lane has finally found her true love...not. He wants to major in gym when he grows up. Mrs. Kim is raging when she finds out about Lane's double date with Dean and Rory. <br /> <br />Concert Interruptus: Lorelai and Sookie take Rory, Paris, Louise, and Madeline to a Bangles concert. While there, Louise and Madeline get asked by college guys to a party so, Lorelai has to put up her mother radar and find them. Meanwhile, Lorelai and Rory's home is the drop-off point for town rummage sale donations. <br /> <br />That Damn Donna Reed: After Dean expresses approval of the meatlof-and-pearls domesticity protrayed in The Donna Reed Show. Rory surprises him with a 1950's styled Donna night. She cooks and dresses up and everything. Also, an unexpected visitor shakes up Lorelai's home. <br /> <br />Christopher Returns: Now that Christopher Haden, Lorelai's old flame and Rory's father, is a guest in the girls' house, enough time has passed for the Hadens and Gilmores to enjoy a reunion dinner at the Gilmore Mansion, right? Wrong. Way wrong. <br /> <br />Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers: The town's romance-themed Founders Firelight Festival is near, and it seems almost everyone is in love. But, Lorelai is faced with her mom's matchmaking. And Dean tells Rory that he loves her. But, when Rory doesn't say anything when he tells her Dean breaks up with her. Ain't love grand? <br /> <br />The Breakup, Part 2: Tales of two loves: Rory attempts to overcome her loss of Dean by creating and tackling a daunting list of things to do. But, in the end realizes she can't put hold her feelings by making a list. Lorelai has a one-night relapse of her feelings for Max.  <br /> <br />The Third Lorelai: The original Lorelai, with attitude and checkbook in tow, visits from London and offers a trust fund to pay for great-granddaughter Rory's education-a turf grandmother Emily fiercely intends to keep for herself. <br /> <br />Emily in Wonderland: Rory and Emily's tour of Stars Hollow provides the older woman with new insights into Lorelai's first years as a single mom. Rootless Rachel wnts to put down her roots. Can Luke trust her? NO HE AND LORELAI ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER! <br /> <br />P.S. I Lo...: Love is hard. Arguing is easy. Partial truths and misunderstandings over each other's romantic life leads to a major Gilmore-girl blowup...and prompts Rory to seek an emotional safe haven at Grandma Emily's. <br /> <br />Love, Daisies & Troubadours: Love goes: Rachel suspects there's more to the Luke-Lorelai relationship than good coffee. Love returns: Rory finally says the words Dean needs to hear: \\"I love you you idiot!\\" Love must decide: Max has exactly what Lorelai wanted for her proposal not 999 not 1001 but, 1000 yellow daisies and one question for Lorelai. Will Lorelai say yes and mary him?  <br /> <br />Overall a MUST HAVE for anybody! A Gilmore fan or someone who hasn't even heard of Gilmore Girls but, just stumbled randomly upon my review MUST get Gilmore Girls Season 1. Money well spent.
014240165X|1.0|I came across the Alex Rider Adventure novels when it was announced that Alex Pettyfer had been chosen out of fivehundred boys to play the lead in the movie version of the first book in the series, \\"Stormbreaker\\". Intrigued, I went and bought the book, being a firm believer in reading the story before seeing the film. <br /> <br />I wish I had deviated from that principle just this once. \\"Stormbreaker\\" is possibly the worst written book I have ever read. The use of language is clumsy to a degree that it is almost embarrassing. There is virtually no character development, the plot is outrageously contrived and overstuffed, and all protagonists are so clichd it's nauseating. The \\"bad guys\\" are disgustingly bad and the good guy - so far, there is practically only one: Alex - is disgustingly good. No shades, no fuzzy edges, no intriguing duplicities. This is a comic strip version of a spy novel without the pictures to keep you entertained. <br /> <br />The only thing compelling me to finish the book was actual disbelief that it could be this disappointing until the very end. But, unfortunately, it was. <br /> <br />Horowitz may be an accomplished scriptwriter. And I grant him that he probably had the whole storyboard in his head when writing this novel. I can even imagine this book being moderately successful as a film by piggy-backing on the James Bond hype, if directing and acting are sound (the cast list at least leaves nothing to be desired). But Horowitz is not a novelist, not by a long shot. <br /> <br />This is supposed to be a children's book, the protagonist being 14 years old. I can't help being offended on behalf of every intelligent juvenile who is duped into reading it. This is not the Real McCoy. Go read John Le Carr instead.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Quite possibly the best animated film made during the 1980's, \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\\" crosses science fiction with war scenes of palpable emotional impact. The end result is more ambitious than expected, as the movie reflects on the hypocrisy of war, and mankind's capacity of terrible acts during times of conflict. Even without too much graphic human suffering, \\"Nausicaa...\\" leaves a mark the way \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"The Deer Hunter\\" left theirs. Yes, the movie also contains flying airships, strange creatures, and psychic powers, but writer/director Hayao Miyazaki merely uses them as context for the issue that's really preoccupying him. <br /> <br />The movie takes place one thousand years after a fiery cataclysm decimates humanity. All remnants of the human race have dispersed, and a \\"Toxic Jungle\\" serves a natural barrier between nations. This enchanted forest contains giant insects, trees that would dwarf the redwoods, and plants that release strange white spores. Inhaling the spores over long periods of time can prove fatal, as the people of the Valley of the Wind, who used to live closer to the \\"Toxic Jungle,\\" know all too well. <br /> <br />In hopes of finding a cure for the lethal powders produced by the flora, Princess Nausicaa, pride and joy of her people, makes regular journeys to the \\"Toxic Jungle.\\" A top gun behind the controls of her jet ski/hang glider hybrid, the princess is even more likable for how much she clearly cares about her subjects. When she stumbles across the abandoned shell of an Ohm, an elephantine mollusk whose shell features translucent skylights for \\"eyes,\\" Nausicaa's first thoughts have to do with the potential benefits for the valley. Unfortunately, casual activities such as this, and saving her friend from a ticked-off insect that chases him halfway across an adjacent desert, eventually give way to a more serious story. Very soon, war arrives at the doorstep of her home. <br /> <br />The kingdom of Tolmekia does not formally declare war on the Valley of the Wind. However, some very important cargo crashes down nearby, and their army rushes in to secure it. The siege leaves Nausicaa's father, the king, murdered, and her people inducted into the Tolmekians' master plan. Unfortunately, Tolmekia's main enemy, another relatively advanced kingdom called Pejite, cannot separate unwitting foes from genuine ones, so they plan to wipe out the entire valley using a very clever strategem. <br /> <br />Miyazaki, who has addressed the topic of war in other features (most recently, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\"), paints the conflict in \\"Nausicaa...\\" as a potentially endless cycle of atrocities. Ironically, those who inflict there terrible deeds, the director argues, sincerely believe that humanity will benefit from their actions. For example, the Tolmekians plan to use the cargo, which they stole from Pejite, to destroy the \\"Toxic Jungle\\" once and for all. The way Princess Kushana, the officer in charge of the Tolmekian army, sees it, the forest must be destroyed, or mankind will spend the rest of eternity living at the mercy of the insects. <br /> <br />On the flipside, Pejite is ready to unleash a glowing, red-eyed Hell upon the Valley of the Wind. Their main purpose, however, isn't preventing their rival's machinations, but getting the cargo back, so they can level the \\"Toxic Jungle\\" themselves. Like the Tolmekians, Pejite also wants to return mankind to its former, loftier position. However, they are deathly afraid of Tolmekia being the sole possessor of a power as destructive as that cargo. To Nausicaa, who spends time as a prisoner of both kingdoms, the mutual willingness to kill innocents to achieve a goal makes Tolmekia and Pejite equals in her eyes. But Asbel, a vengeful young pilot/prince from Pejite, takes umbrage. \\"All the Tolmekians want is to take over the world,\\" he says. \\"We are nothing like them.\\" His words only serve to underscore his naivete. After all, since when does any participant in a war not view themselves in a superior moral light compared to the enemy? <br /> <br />Luckily, Miyazaki constantly reminds the audience what \\"fighting a just war\\" really implies. As the conflict between the two nations draws in creatures from the \\"Toxic Jungle,\\" it's the weak who suffer most, while those in power get to indulge their most sadistic impulses. Whether it's images of women and children huddled together, hungry and scared, while the menfolk prepare war plans; the old adage \\"burning a village in order to save it\\" brought to startling reality for heroes returning home; a battlefield littered with the corpses of soldier dragonflies (an allegorical shot that's just as potent as what Miyazaki intended them to represent); or, most appallingly, a display of near-unbearable cruelty visited upon an innocent life for the expressed purpose of stirring up its comrades, trust that in \\"Nausicaa...,\\" war contains enough pain for everyone, regardless of gender, age, or species. <br /> <br />Indeed, like most modern war movies, \\"Nausicaa...\\" is a veritable minefield of moral transgressions. Even the titular heroine commits one. It's out of character, of course; through most of the movie, she shows nothing less than absolute respect towards all living things. This one action becomes a blemish, something she spends the rest of the movie trying desperately to redeem. Interestingly, Miyazaki won't excuse her simply because it is wartime. Human beings are not animals, he seems to be arguing. Our ability to rationalize, to accept the complexities of a given situation, sets us apart from the beasts, who are slaves to their baser instincts. <br /> <br />These baser instincts, such as the need for revenge, cause Nausicaa's people to take up arms against the Tolmekian invaders. It seems that their doomed airship carried spores from the \\"Toxic Jungle,\\" spelling the end for a beloved orchard. Can Nausicaa save her people's souls, lest they become beasts, or worse, standard-issue characters from a war flick? Miyazaki's other films during the same decade (\\"Castle in the Sky,\\" \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\") tended towards happy resolutions, so don't expect the writer/director to deviate this time, either, even if that makes \\"Nausicaa...\\" less tragic, and radically different, from just about every other lock-and-load epic that came before.
0060955775|5.0|I have read several of this authors' books, and yet it still amazes me how he is able to thread important insights into REALLY interesting story lines - making his books of fiction ones that we can all learn something from...<br /><br />Don't be misled by the title \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\" - although this is definitely an important part of the story, a greater part has to do with choosing to live - making the deliberate choice to really LIVE each day, as opposed to just existing..<br /><br />This book is also about the impact each of us have on everyone we meet - whether we realize it or not - and that this impact can be positive or negative, our choice.<br /><br />Another REALLY important aspect was how we as a society determine what we consider \\"normal\\" & \\"abnormal\\", and how this impacts us personally, as well as how it impacts how we view others.  It's truly amazing how quickly we humans change what we deem as \\"normal\\" & \\"okay\\" - and it is equally amazing how important it is to many of us to \\"fit in\\", to be a part of the majority, even if this means denying who we are & what feels right to us...<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend it to those who enjoy \\"stories with a lesson\\" - you won't be disappointed!
B00000DCH9|5.0|Usually when artist that are little known (as Billy was when this was first released) and there is a huge hit on the album (Piano Man) the rest is usually filled with filler material..Not only is there no Filler material on this album, every single song is a Gem. Even though I prefer 52nd St to this, this would be my second favorite Joel album then after that would have to be the off the wall and strange Nylon Curtain. This is a must have for every Billy Joel fan. Don't be surpried that you acutally might like the rest of the songs then \\"Piano Man\\" cause I think Travelin Prayer and Stop in Nevada and Your my Home are much better..ENJOY
0684824906|4.0|He was a hick country lawyer with all the down-home quirks of a frontiersman: His clothes were rumpled and he walked as if his legs needed oiling. His political experience was almost as unimpressive. While he'd made a slight mark as a freshman congressman, it was for all the wrong reasons: He'd brashly accused a sitting president of ginning up evidence to push the country into a needless war.<br /><br />No wonder hardly anyone thought much of Abraham Lincoln's chances for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860. Essentially, he was the fourth man in a three-man race, up against a trio of politicians with loads of experience as governors and senators.<br /><br />But Mr. Lincoln carefully carved out a moderate position on slavery and transformed himself from an also-ran to Republican party nominee. He won again in November. Then, in a remarkable display of equanimity, he immediately asked his three convention foes join his cabinet.<br /><br />They agreed, with visions of President Pushover dancing in their heads. But they soon learned better, as historian Doris Kearns Goodwin explains in her captivating 916-page book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />In this immense and immensely readable work, Ms. Goodwin uncovers how Lincoln's unusual combination of forgiving human spirit and savvy political instincts converted his enemies into (mostly) loyal friends and advisers.<br /><br />Without their expertise and guidance, Lincoln could have lost the Civil War; without his careful steering, the bipartisan cabinet would have dissolved into endless angling for power.<br /><br />Thanks to voluminous letters and diaries, William Seward and Salmon Chase - Lincoln's Secretary of State and the Treasury - are the most vividly portrayed cabinet members in \\"Team of Rivals.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Seward comes across as one of the forgotten heroes of American history. He emerges as an energetic and inspiring abolitionist who provides the basic wording that Lincoln - in one of history's great feats of editing - turned into the powerful poetry of his second inaugural address.<br /><br />Mr. Chase - the man whose grim face stares out from defunct $10,000 bills - is nearly a comic villain, constantly plotting to gain power and endlessly threatening to resign. But even he, often unwittingly, serves Lincoln's ends.<br /><br />Goodwin isn't a prose stylist, and she could have included less play-by-play and more color commentary. But this veteran of books on the presidencies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and John Fitzgerald Kennedy is still a master storyteller, and she includes dozens of memorable anecdotes.<br /><br />Some of the tales resonate today, including those portraying Lincoln's masterly use of press leaks and his obsession with campaign battleground states. She also includes tales of some of Lincoln's political missteps, including the young Abe's ill-advised attacks on President Polk over the Mexican War.<br /><br />Other stories liven \\"Team of Rivals\\" with delicious comedy.<br /><br />They include Lincoln's favorite ribald jokes, Vice President Andrew Johnson's gloriously addled 1865 inaugural address (during which he actually stopped mid-speech to boom, \\"What's the name of the secretary of the Navy?\\"), and the story of the young Army captain who yelled \\"Get down, you fool!\\" as Lincoln - in a moment of foolhardy curiosity - craned his neck to get a closer view of the action in a Civil War battle.<br /><br />The captain is Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., one of many 19th-century luminaries who appear in \\"Team of Rivals.\\" But as intriguing as the supporting characters in this book may be, they can't hold a candle to three vibrant and influential women who appear here.<br /><br />Frances Seward is even more of a fiery abolitionist than her husband, and her perceptive and forceful letters seem to strengthen the deep love the two have for one another.<br /><br />Mary Todd Lincoln, maligned by history, here shows glimpses of the warmth and wit that must have won over the future president.<br /><br />And Chase's captivating daughter Kate becomes the reigning queen of the nation's capital - no thanks to a jealous First Lady - even as she works to juggle a drunken suitor and a father with overpowering ambition.<br /><br />And Lincoln?<br /><br />He's no saint, as revealed by his truth-stretching political maneuvering and lapses in his vaunted tolerance for criticism.<br /><br />No matter. His self-confidence grows during his presidency, blending with his natural charm to win over skeptics. He conquers grief and melancholy.<br /><br />And his \\"astoundingly magnanimous soul\\" allows him to accept blame - and deflect it from others - with almost unfathomable ease.<br /><br />Goodwin herself, deflated by a recent plagiarism scandal, could learn a lesson here. Some critics feel that she still hasn't demonstrated a Lincolnesque willingness to accept full responsibility for her errors.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, any past missteps Goodwin may have made do not detract from the powerful story she tells in \\"Team of Rivals.\\"<br /><br />Bolstered by faith in a higher power, Lincoln instinctively understood the value of both grit and generosity. Taken as a whole, his all-too-brief presidency has more to teach us about real leadership than any seminar or self-help book ever could.odd Lincoln, maligned by history, here shows glimpses of the warmth and wit that must have won over the future president. <br /> <br />And Chase's captivating daughter Kate becomes the reigning queen of the nation's capital - no thanks to a jealous First Lady - even as she works to juggle a drunken suitor and a father with overpowering ambition. <br /> <br />And Lincoln? <br /> <br />He's no saint, as revealed by his truth-stretching political maneuvering and lapses in his vaunted tolerance for criticism. <br /> <br />No matter.

B0000A118M|5.0|This is one of the best Jazz albums that I have ever heard! Oh, to the Reviewer below me COLTRANE PASSED AWAY IN THE LATE 60's, COLTRANCE PUTS MUSCIAL INEPET DUDS LIKE WARRENT AND RATT TO SHAME..HIS ONE SINGLE SONG THAT IS ON THIS ALBUM IS HARDER TO COMPOSE THEN 10YRS OF WARRENTS AND RATTS MUSIC COMBINED...
B0000DIXDR|5.0|i watched this movie for the third time the other night and it never gets old. the music, the dancing, the romance, and the whole story are still as good as the first time i watched it. it makes me cry every time. it is a chick flick of sorts but it is more than that too, it also is about social classes and how love is more complicated than it first seems. a really well done movie.
B000002KIE|5.0|I am really having a hard time understanding some of the negitive reviews for this album, espically the one below me. First off lets all agree that the Sex Pistols weren't great musicians, YET..they might have been the first to have poured so much anger into an album for the time. Yes I understand the Ramons were also around at this time, yet when I listen to the Ramones first CD and compare it to this one, The Sex Pistols seem like they were the angrier and more intense band. Also, forget what the reviewer said below about how the Sex Pistols were trying to be part of an \\"Pop\\" Culture over in England. I don't think that has anything to do with the fact of the music they created, not to mention that who cares if they were trying to start a fashion statement or not..they still were what they were ...angry muscians who poured a hell of alot more emotions into their music then crap bands like Good Charlotte and My Chemical Romance ever will. Those other poser bands also are doing nothing but try to write a bunch of pop tunes of from Chessy ass punk riffs that the pistols and Ramones invented 30yrs ago (rumor has it that My Chemical Romance even charges people that meet them in public to hang out with them...please!!)AND the phrase Pop Culture is alot different then being part of pop music... if that makes sense!? Also, lets take our hats off to the Pistols for creating this Extreme music which would allow Extreme Metal bands of the early 80's (Kreator, Slayer, Venom, Suicidal Tendencies)to have something to build on. This is a great album..Call it Classic Punk, Call it Classic Rock...Just call it a classic..Pick one up!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is simply one of the most well done television shows which, in typical Fox fashion, was cancelled (as was several other great shows).  It has a great cast, great plot, great stories, and deserves to be seen by anyone with even the smallest amount of interest in science fiction or action, with a dose of humor. I can't recommend this show enough, I don't think this is the last we will see of this show.
B000777J2S|5.0|I came across this albumn in a best buy ad and looked it up out of sheer curiosity and i found it absolutly beautiful. <br />I've never listened to any other artist with such heartfelt emotions(with an exception to Mewithoutyou and The Cure)but this albumn is so powerful it brings tears to my eyes.I feel Antony's voice bares some resemblence to Aaron Neville's but with more soul than he was ever capable of. He even has a strange quality to it which makes it sound as if its not one person but a small choir. And though his voice is not for everyone it's cascade of emotion cannot be denied.  <br /> <br />And to Drezden an acoustic guitar does not appear once on this albumn. <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|There are certain things that hit the viewer immediately the first time you see this film - the beauty of the landscape for one thing. And then there are these two young men who instantly strike you as solitary and singular. I must admit that I had a delayed reaction to this movie. When I walked out of the theatre, I wasn't as overwhelmed as I was a day or two later and I think the reason is because this film is one to be contemplated and thought about - a lot.<br /><br />First, the movie was described to me as a movie about g*y cowboys. That wasn't quite what I took away from it. Let's face it, if this were just a movie about g*y cowboy's trying to hide their lifestyle from everyone else, it would have been a completely different movie. There was something much deeper than sexuality at play - deeper on so many levels, frankly. What makes it even more reflective is that no explanations are offered for practically anything in the film. As a writer, one of the first things I learned was \\"show, don't tell.\\" This is most definitely a \\"show, don't tell\\" film. One of the bigger questions I was left with (and still wonder about today) is why Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) was so stricken with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). You are left wondering what would have happened had Jack never reached for Ennis's hand in the tent that night - if they had just completed their sheepherding jobs and moved on. Would Ennis's life with his wife and kids have moved forward in the way that it had been going if Jack had not sent a postcard four years later? As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Jack is more interested in men than women but you are never quite sure with Ennis (sometimes very sure and other times not sure at all). He doesn't pursue other men. There are no suggestions that he even looks at other men. There are scenes (before the postcard arrives) that leave you feeling that he is, in fact, in love with his wife and children. He even goes so far as to display some very macho behavior when some low-lifes at a fair use foul language in front of his \\"girls.\\" When he gets divorced, he dates another woman, though you do feel that he's not fully \\"present\\" in that situation either. His unraveling as the years go by is all about Jack and it's almost as if his only reason to live are for his stolen moments with Jack on Brokeback Mountain. When he loses Jack for good, he is so emotionally shut down, that he nearly chooses to miss his own daughter's wedding.<br /><br />Jack, on the other hand, displays a clearer sense of self from the beginning. He is the more openly sensitive of the two, more skillful at getting needs met and taking initiative. More expressive in every way. But, as with Ennis, his life is fueled by their meetings on Brokeback Mountain, with a few detours along the way. There are questions left in your mind about Jack as well - it's never fully clear why he chose to marry since he seemed to have a sharper awareness of who he was and what he needed. And yet, he does seem smitten when he first meets his wife and has his baby. Was he just a product of the time and place he lived in (1960s Texas)? Could be. But this is all just part of what makes this movie so brilliant. You find yourself experiencing the film emotionally, not just watching it and that's very surprising (and somewhat disorienting) in a way. And, as with real life, there are so many unanswered questions - about ourselves, the world, life, death - that are never resolved.<br /><br />For the people who say that this is just Hollywood's attempt to \\"legitimize\\" or \\"glamorize\\" homosexuality - dudes, listen up: it's about the suffering these men went through and how awful their lives had become over time. There's nothing glamorous about any of it - just a lot of pain and misery. I never felt that the movie was pushing any type of lifestyle. It's just a story about two men in a certain time, place and situation and should be viewed that way.<br /><br />Ang Lee is an amazing director. Annie Proulx who wrote the short story that evolved into this film is the Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Shipping News. I believe Brokeback Mountain appeared in the New Yorker Magazine in 1997 or 1998 (fairly recent). I often wonder what she felt when she wrote this. The casting was spot on - Heath Ledger is an exceptional actor, no question (he gave a powerful performance in the film, The Order) but it is Jake Gyllenhaal who, for me, carried this film in a way that stirred up my insides (I was on his emotional \\"I wish I knew how to quit you\\" rollercoaster).<br /><br />I recommend this film, though I know it might not be for everyone (I hear that it's been banned in Utah, actually). And if you have that \\"not sure\\" feeling at first, I can guarantee that it will eventually settle. You won't be able to stop thinking about it for a long time.wrote the short story that evolved into this film is the Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Shipping News.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a big fan of Jane Austen and all of her work. I have actually taken a college class that dealt with all of her work- all 6 novels, her novella, and her unfinished novel Sanditon. I have always had a soft spot for Pride and Prejudice, and LOVE the A&E version (and Colin Firth). The only thing I didn't like about this new movie is a few historical inaccuracies. These, however, are easily passed over and you can see how wonderful this movie really is. Both Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen did an excellent job. I agree with someone who said in a previous post that they acted more along the lines with the ages of Elizabeth and Darcy. I really liked how they portrayed that sweet, soulful love that I understood Lizzie and Darcy to have. Also, that ending... what more could a P&P fan ask for? :)
0743454537|5.0|I have just finished \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" by Jody Picoult. What an emotionally wrenching read! It was like a rollercoaster, much like living in such a situation must be, but the end was a shocker.  I really didn't think that Kate would survive, for one thing. I thought she was too far gone to recover no matter whether she got the kidney or not.  I thought that Anna would follow her original intention of giving Kate the kidney just because she couldn't bear to live without her sister, in spite of the Judge's ruling, willingly and perhaps futilely, because again, as I said, I expected Kate to be too far gone to benefit from the transplant.  But real life is like that. It's not neat and tidy, and happy endings usually don't happen.<br />I have the feeling that the ramifications of the medical ethics involved in cases such as these will occupy my mind for a long time after I've read this novel. I remember in the news a few years ago there was a Hispanic couple who had given birth to a child to help an older one who was chronically ill. I was uncomfortable with that story at the time.<br />The theme of sister as keepers of each other's emotional well-being  runs through the book.<br />There are three sets of sisters: Anna and Kate, of course, each supporting the other through the viccisitudes of Kate's lifelong illness, and Julia and Izzy, who are each others' mutual aid society through broken love affairs, then there are Suzanne \\"Zanne\\" and Sara. In this case it is the strong, competent Zanne who is more the \\"keeper\\"supporting and consoling the emotionally exhausted Sara who really doesn't have the resources left to console and support anyone but Kate. Nevertheless, Sara is grateful for the love and strength of her sister.<br />The strains put on family relationships where one child because of chronic illness is the focus of parental attention is realistically portrayed. Paradoxically, although resenting the attention focused on Kate by the parents, both Jesse and Anna love Kate so much that they, too, in the end willingly sacrifice their childhoods to minister to her each in his or or own way. No one wants to lose Kate in spite of each sibling's agonizing and guilty exploration of the idea of how life would be for each of them if Kate were to die.<br />As in real life often, the reality of the illness of the child is dealt with by women. The men, although in great emotional agony find ways, sometimes destructively (as in the case of Jesse) to cope with it. Brian, a fire fighter, always has his job to distract him, but Sara and  Anna are always with the reality. It eventually puts them at odds, although not in the way it seems at first.<br />Jody Picoult has written a realistic portrayal of a family in crisis that will be changed forever by the chronic illness of a child and an unexpected loss.<br />And I don't think I will ever forget Anna and Kate.uch that they, too, in the end willingly sacrifice their childhoods to minister to her each in his or or own way.

B000C65Z1G|3.0|This surprisingly good drama/thriller will have viewer hooked from begging to end. The story about a women that's murderd and her husband trying to find out why and on the way uncovers a conspercicy that will change the world. The story is very smart and intreging but you have to pay close attention or you'll be lost. The movie is confussing at times becouse the story is complex and if you miss one thing you'll be lost. The acting is the greatest thing about the film. Overall it's entertaining and it's a good film.
B0006J28BO|5.0|\\"The Cat Returns\\" has all of the charm, incredible animation, and intensity of a Hayao Miyazaki film. But it's not directed by Miyazaki. As the documentary included on this DVD says, Miyazaki began wondering about the future of Ghibli because the founders are \\"getting on in years\\". The hunt began for a new young director.  They found Hiroyuki Morita who ended up creating such incredible storyboards for \\"the Cat Project\\" that Ghibli decided to let him direct it as a feature. Their instincts served them well. \\"The Cat Returns\\", at only 75 minutes, contains all of the magic of other Studio Ghibli releases. It also contains Miyazaki's favorite theme: a young girl who finds herself through a strange journey (Miyazaki receives credit for \\"Project Concept\\"). In this case Haru, a Japanese schoolgirl - complete with signature outfit - saves the life of a cat with a lacrosse stick and finds herself transported into a surreal and bizarre world of ensouled creations. She finds herself semi-forcefully betrothed to this same cat, but the Baron (a right and proper aristocratic cat who runs \\"the Cat Bureau\\" and who first appeared in \\"Whispers of the Heart\\") comes to her aid with the help of the enormous Muta (who usually steals the scene). Even though the movie runs 75 minutes the incredible volume of action makes it feel like a full-length feature. The animation, as always, is incredible. If Morita represents the next generation of Ghibli directors, the studio should prepare itself for years upon years of further successful releases.<br /><br />Voiceover talent in English includes Cary Elwes (\\"Farm Boy\\" from \\"The Princess Bride\\") perfectly cast as the Baron, Elliot Gould (from too many things to list) as the Crow, Anne Hathaway (\\"The Princess Diaries\\") as Haru and Tim Curry (\\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\") as the Cat King. The English and Japanese versions play differently mostly due to the voices. Curry's King has more of a hippy feel whereas the original sounds more like a corrupt and evil king. Regardless of the differences, it's great to have both versions on one DVD.<br /><br />The DVD also includes a great documentary on the making of \\"The Cat Returns\\" including scenes from the voice sessions for the Japanese version, interviews with Miyazaki, Morita, Toshio Suzuki (longtime Ghibli producer), and others. It also discusses the movie's music with Yuji Nomi and the ukulele-playing Ayano Tsuji. And, as on other Disney/Ghibli releases, \\"Behind the Microphone\\" lets the english voice talent talk about their experiences with dubbing the film into English.<br /><br />Any Studio Ghibli fan will enjoy \\"The Cat Returns\\". It has everything anyone would expect from one of the world's best animation houses. And, judging by this release, it will likely remain one of the best well into the future.t and evil king.

B0001KL5DA|3.0|I never wtaced six feet under when it was origianlly on the air. I enjoyed this season it had more drama then the first and more of a story then the first. The acting is top notch and the story's are great. The season final was alos very good and it leaves you on the edge of your seat. The series is not the greatest at times the stories drag on and on and on.
B000CNEO1G|5.0|I honestly enjoy these arrangements of Bach pieces for the trumpet and Ms. Balsom sounds beautiful on all of the them. I congratulate her in producing a high-quality CD and look forward to hearing more of her in the future. Her facility on the instrument is sweet and complete. If you like solo trumpet music, this will be a treat for the ears.
B00003CX95|5.0|Unlike the other reviewers, I did not watch this film for the historical data. I first watched it because of Mel Gibson. I think he could act in anything and make it believable. But this story line is good and perhaps there is a bit much violence, but from all the fiction I have ever read about Scotland and England, there was an awful lot of violence at that time. So if you love Mel Gibson and you love all things knights, ladies and swordplay, then you will love this. I do. I watch it over and over again.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Presumption: Although I like historical movies, I thought the box office failure indicated a rather long, boring movie.  I was not particularly thrilled with Orlando as the lead.  I thought the DVD extras would make it worth purchasing. <br /> <br />Result:  The movie was much better than I thought it would be, and deserves 4 stars on its own.  Although long, it was not boring.  Casting was very good, although some of the finest actors might have been a bit under utilized.  The DVD extras are first rate.  Additionally, the Pilgrim's Journey has an amazing amount of information for anyone interested in this time period.
B000002GYG|4.0|This is it.  Bebop poetry at its best.  Early Waits in all his resplendent glory, rapping on everything from \\"green gabardines\\" to \\"dangerous veal cutlets\\" and \\"a yellow biscuit of a buttery cue ball moon rollin' maverick across an obsidian sky.\\"  This is a mind boggling live performance from 1975, featuring Waits in top form, channeling Ferlinghetti, Lenny Bruce, the Beats, Lord Buckley, and filtering it through a salacious, strepy voice.  Waits may not be a singer, but he's a master of rhythmic diatribe, often utilizing Ken Nordine-style word-jazz and scat phrasing.  As a result, most of his \\"tunes\\" sound like poetic breath control exercises.  What Waits' voice does to words is unbelievable.  It slices and dices them, syllable by syllable, garbles their vowels, sucks them down to the bare consonant, molds them into a bolus of half-human sound, and spits them out like pieces of teeth from the mouth of a broken prize fighter.  His lyrics linger in the listener's memory like the brown haze of an urban smog ignited by approaching twilight.  Let's face it, the dude is a genius.    \\"Nighthawks at the Diner,\\" while not Waits' best album, is at least a great early representation of his stage act.  It is as important to understanding his roots as Randy Newman's live 1971 album is to that singer's history.  It veers from hilarious and profound to maudlin and dull, then back again.  The intro and outro are the highlights of the evening.  In the middle it gets boozy.  And the less he \\"sings,\\" the better the performances are.  This is closer to a comedy album with jazz backing than a straight musical album.  I guarantee you've never heard anything like it.  And once you've heard it, you'll never hear anything like it again.      And now, as Waits himself puts it, \\"It's time to make like a hockey player and get the puck out of here....Time to make like a bakery truck and haul buns.\\"
B00007LTIL|5.0|American Beauty was the first album by the Grateful Dead that I listened to, and I mean really listened to. I had heard Europe '72 once, and maybe a song here and there, but this is what really got me hooked. The first time I heard it, I listened to it probably ten or twenty times. <br /> <br />Along with Workingman's Dead, American Beauty is the best of the Dead's stuido work. Even though the Dead are viewed as a live band (a correct view, I might add), the work on this album is amazing.  <br /> <br />The album starts out with \\"Box of Rain\\", arguably Phil Lesh's best song. \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" became a regular in the concert rotation. \\"Ripple\\" is possibly one of the best songs by the Grateful Dead. \\"Attics of My Life\\" has the most amazing harmonics, though they could never get it quite right in concert. \\"Truckin'\\" is the most famous tune by the Dead. <br /> <br />It's quite astonishing that a live band could put out such a great studio album such as this, but the one thing I've learned about the Grateful Dead is that they can always find some way to surprise you.

His voice is clear and has significant range and he sounds very upbeat in a lot of his songs although in three songs he is singing the blues; \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\", \\"Bless You\\" and \\"Scared\\". He also sounds care free of some of the weight of activism and he sounds like he enjoyed doing the album. \\"Whatever gets you through the night\\" sets a fast pace with Elton Jonh and a strong sax that sets this album apart as it is upbeat and a bit bluesy, totally unlike anything Lennon had done in quite a while. The other top ten song is \\"Dream #9\\" that has a dream like sound as Lennon sounds excellent vocally with a slightly distant sound that makes it effective as a dream sequence and the instrumentation is first rate as Lennon has a great talent of session musicians on board. Doing what sounds like french giberish Lennon croons \\"Ah! b&ouml;wakawa pouss&eacute;, pouss&eacute;\\", which means literally nothing but allegedly came to Lennon in a dream. The latter word was a bit controversial sounding perhaps echoing his sense of humor or desire to maintain a little controversy. The rest of the album holds up well although they are are not what I would consider pop hits. I particularly like \\"Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox, which is an upbeat tune about a woman who makes him happy even when he's lonely and posesses the great lyric \\"She makes me sweat and forget who I am\\". Another love song that sounds like Lennon singing to Ono with a blusey sound is \\"Bless You\\" with lyrics echoing his sentiment such as \\"Bless you wherever you are, Windswept child on a shooting star, Restless Spirits depart, Still we're deep in each other's hearts\\". 'Bless You\\" is a strong tune that is haunting with his heart felt voice. \\"Steel and Glass\\" is another strong song where Lennon  puts down a succesful two-faced someone described as having an \\"LA tan and your NY walk\\", but he could be cutting himself down as well as he chimes \\"your mother left you, when you were small\\". An entertaining album that may not have the depth of a great album but for Lennon fans, it's entertaining and refreshing to hear Lennon's voice strong and upbeat.Y walk\\", but he could be cutting himself down as well as he chimes \\"your mother left you, when you were small\\". An entertaining album that may not have the depth of a great album but for Lennon fans, it's entertaining and refreshing to hear Lennon's voice strong and upbeat.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|The theatrical version was just awful.  Most people who are David Lynch fans--which I am not--agree that \\"Dune\\" is a terrible movie.  It's not just the huge liberties he took with the story (tho' the DeLaurentises maybe more responsible for that than Lynch, to be fair), its that Lynch clearly had no understanding of the source material.  Frank Herbert's books were subtle, nuanced explorations of some of the most basic and universal themes of the human experience.  This film ignores what made the book great in exchange for a Lynch horror-show where the gross, disgusting and perverted take center stage. <br /> <br />But again, it's the liberties with the story that really ruin this movie.  The entire rationale for the conspiracy between the \\"Padishah\\" Emperor and the Harkonnens was that the Atreides were developing an army that was superior to the Sardaukar troops with which the Corrinos had made themselves the Imperial House.  The whole idea behind the culture of the Imperium was that development of HUMAN potential, not \\"weirding modules.\\"  Duke Leto's new army was built around that principle.  Incorporating Bene Gesserit techniques, Leto was constructing a group of warriors capable by sheer human effort to overcome any enemy. <br /> <br />His son would combine that training with the incredibly tough Fremen, infuse them with religious fanaticism and then defeat Shaddam IV and conquer the \\"Known Universe.\\" <br /> <br />Instead we get \\"weirding modules.\\"  Basically, magic boxes that blow stuff up.  There is absolute NOTHING about this in the books; and indeed, to reiterate, it runs completely AGAINST every theme in Herbert's work.   <br /> <br />Combining the drastic plot changes with Lynch's bizarre sensibilities and fetishes and you get the gigantic mess that this movie is. <br /> <br />Kyle MacLachlan's insipid, wimpy performance is another huge flaw.  There is no WAY any one who's read these books can believe, for a minute, that he could be a guerilla leader, let alone an Emperor, a Messiah or transcendent being.  It gives me the giggles to think about.  Alec Newman's utterly convincing performance in the two mini-series as Paul Muad'Dib (and \\"The Preacher\\") is far superior to MacLachlan's in every way.  Newman looks like he could have just stepped out of the desert.  MacLachlan looks like he just stepped out of an Armani suit with a $200 haircut.  This movie showcases why he's always remained in the cinematic bush leagues.  He simply doesn't have the talent as an actor for any significant role.  (That he's now gotten fat doesn't help.) <br /> <br />Francesca Annis's stiff, unsympathetic Jessica is a bore.  Jurgen Prochnow, one of Germany's greatest actors, looks here as if he's constantly biting back a laugh.  Even the performance of Kenneth MacMillian as Baron Harkonnen, though praised by some, is a show case of just how badly an actor can overact.  (Even Susan Sarandon doesn't come close in her off-kilter performance in the second mini-series.)  Jose Ferrer has simply no credibility as the ruler of multi-galactic empire.  The only performance that isn't ridiculous is Sian Phillip's Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.  But she's just a brilliant actor stuck in a huge mess of a film.  After her stunning work in \\"I, Claudius\\" fans of the latter can only cringe at the total waste of her talents. <br /> <br />The only real fun in the movie is Sting's performance as Feyd-Rautha.  Mr. Sumner seems to be the only one who's aware that he's in a badly done farce.  He plays it to the hilt and his baroquely campy performance is great fun.  But Feyd is a minor character and Sting simply can't lighten the leaden pomposity of Lynch, MacLachlan & company.  But he is great fun to watch. <br /> <br />It has been said that the \\"extended version\\" greatly improves upon the theatrical.  Nonsense.  It's just makes for longer, more excruciating cinematic torture. <br /> <br />There's only one version of \\"Dune\\" as far as fans of the book should beconcerned, and that is John Harrison's mini-series made for Sci-Fi channel.  It's 4.5 hours long and sticks faithfully to the themes, if not always literally, in Herbert's book.  The CG special effects are far superior to the 20 year old special effects in Lynch's disaster.  The CGI sandworms, in particularly, do not bear the phallic aspect that caused so much laughter in the theaters when I saw it.  They actually look how most people had imagined them. <br /> <br />Skip this attempt to make even more dollars off this gigantic flop and buy the two Sci-Fi Channel mini-series.  They deliver the essence of the original trilogy far better than Lynch did and the modern special effects--a good deal of which are contributed by the same company that did the CG effects for Babylon 5, Netter Digital--are simply stunning.  Not only that, the mini-series are filmed without that \\"brown soup\\" that covers every frame of Lynch's movie (the movie was shot through a brown light filter to give a \\"darker\\" more \\"menacing\\" look, it failed; instead the movie just looks even more ridiculous). <br /> <br />I remember an interview where MacLachlan stated that the entire cast and crew had \\"signed on for three movies.\\"  Thankfully this movie's \\"Heaven's Gate\\" type failure ensured that Lynch and Co. wouldn't get the chance to mar the other two books of the trilogy.   <br /> <br />As a side note: the complete failure at the box office of this film bankrupted the DeLaurentises, putting a halt to more giggle fests from the family who'd become the Kings of Schlock (Flash Gordon anyone?). <br /> <br />AVOID!!! <br /> <br />BTW, for those of you worrying about the Aspect Ratio of the extended version, there's no reason to.  The movie was shot in 70mm, if memory serves; even if it was only 35mm that presents no problem.  Universal certainly will have used that film from which to make the transfer to digital.  There seems to be a basic misunderstanding of \\"anamorphic\\" by many reviewers.  Anamorphic ensures that the movie will adapt to your TV's screen, whether it's 16X9 or 4X3.  The 1:2.35 ratio, however, indicates that it's been formatted for 16X9 sets.  Those of you with 4X3s will be looking at a small picture with big black lines.

B0000524CY|5.0|They call this version the version we've never seen, which is true, but there's not that much knew. It has the awesome spider walk Regaen does down the stairs(which they cut out of the original), that gives me the chills every time. There's also the flicker of a creepy face when Regaen's mother is down stairs in the kitchen at night. But since I'm here I'll give you my opinion on the whole movie.<br /><br /> Well, as in the book, it moves rather slowly but it's slow for it's own good because you need to understand the relationship between Ragaen and her mother(not to mention the fact that they have no religion which makes it even scarier for them). The wait is definately worth it. After the long wait, the movie wastes no time and just makes you scream through the whole thing. One thing I liked about the movie is how it was mostly similar to the book which I still prefer over the movie. What confuses me is how while Ragaen is possessed, her face is all corroding. I'm still really squeamish when I watch Ragaen jabbing her(...) with the crucifix. Anyway, I say if you're going to buy The Exorcist, buy this version of the movie. Watching Ragaen crawl down the stars upside down with hr arms and legs, and then stopping in the middle to bleed at the mouth and howl is totally worth it.

B00008IHN1|2.0|As someone who graduated from a high school where people attended football games just for the half time show, and has attended several marching band competitions, I was looking forward to seeing Drumline.  I was majorly disappointed.  The storyline and acting in this movie are painfully bad. The main character, Devon, is too annoying for words.  The band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melo dramatic.  I know we can expect movies to stretch reality, but to show the main character begin school at one university, drop out and transfer to another university, and then return to the first university... all in one semester was absurd.  Have the writers of this movie ever attended college?  Have they ever MET anyone who has?<br /><br />I am no expert on drumlines so I cannot judge the authenticity of the musical sequences.  I enjoyed them.  I would have enjoyed the musical sequences more if they did not include a ludicrous number of close ups of the dance squads that accompany the bands performances.  Their ridiculously tight, not to mention sparse costumes coupled with them writhing on the field left me with the impression that the dance squads in this movie looked more like they should have been pole dancing in a cheap strip dive, rather than performing as part of a marching band.<br /><br />I would not reccommend purchasing this movie.  It is not worth the money.  If you feel you must see it, I would rent it, pull up the main menu, and go straight to the scenes with the band performances.  The performance that's played with the closing credits is entertaining as well.  The rest is a waste of time.

0800178394|3.0|...it was lines like this one that kept the movie from being much better.     Bad Boys brings to the screen the story of two Miami policemen and their efforts to protect a key witness in a murder trial.      Will Smith carries out his role well, though by no means is this his best performance.    The major setbacks are in relation to:   1) Martin Lawrence overdoing it with his \\"paranoid\\" character.   2) Tea Leoni's (annoying) character doing and saying the most unlikely things throughout the movie, such as trying to shoot the bad guy from a distance in the middle of a crowded club and much more.  3) The poor choice of an actor to play the captain of the police who is not all man, if you catch my drift...  Any particular reason for that?  In addition, the scene where he is smoking a cigar while shooting some hoops is just ridiculous!  4) The other two cops were just not interesting at all nor were they good actors.   5) The weak and rather boring car chases.     In short, the setting is good, the acting, the plot and the humor are average, while the dialogues and the script are weak.     In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.
0393327655|1.0|The book presents an understanding of history so askew, it's difficult to correlate with reality.  Aside from not understanding much about religion, most of the positions the book advances with regard to religion correspond to those advanced by various fascists such as Ezra Pound, Leon van Huffel, Paul de Mann, and Martin Heidegger. <br /> <br />The great secular states of the 20th century which sought to free themselves from Christianity (Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot)  killed 200 million and enslaved billions in their quest to create an \\"enlightened\\" state based on \\"scientific\\" principles of economics and Darwinism, free of -- if not religion in general -- then Christianity in particular. <br /> <br />Recall Nazi Germany was essentially an attempt to revive the pre-Christian pagan Woten cult, with the hatred of the intellectual class directed towards those \\"responsible\\" for the monotheism that displaced paganism -- the Jews. The author ignores the whole history of how Nazis infilitrated the Christian church in German in the 1930's so as to co-opt it. <br /> <br />Hitler wrote,\\"With the appearance of Christianity, the first spiritual terror entered into the far freer ancient world\\" (Table Talk).  Hitler insisted St. Paul was a bolshevik, and Christianity was bad because it allowed slaves to revolt against their masters, destroyed Rome, was anti-nature, and was all an invention of the Jew.  Hitler's stated goal was to empty the churches \\"... so that none will be left but fools and old women...\\" <br /> <br />The lyrics from a Hitler Youth camp song: \\"We are the Happy Hitler Youth; We have no need of Christian virtue; for Adolph Hitler is our intercessor And our redeemer. No priest, no evil one Can keep us ....\\" <br /> <br />The banning of religion in the Soviet Union emanated from related beliefs; while Hitler adopted Darwinism to advance and support his Aryan master race/nationalistic agenda, the fascists of the Soviet Union took an internationalist approach in their attempt to create a scientific utopia.  <br /> <br />Truth is, Christianity provides the basis for equality before the law, appreciation of science and education, the rule of law, \\"ending\\" slavery, the confinment of superstitions and softening of routine brutal practices common in pagan societies prior to Christianity, the provision of a moral basis to political structures. It offers the only true rationale for human rights and dignity. If you are the result of random, unobserved chemical accidents, there is no basis for claiming you have rights. The concept comes from the Christian understanding of humans as being made in the spiritual image of God. <br /> <br />Every day, we in the West benefit from the heavy-lifting done by previous generations of \\"fundamentalists\\".  The author, while railing against religion, is doing so using concepts whose only source of authority is religious in nature. <br /> <br />Science offers no alternative to faith, because science is a form of faith. Science assumes (1) the universe can be understood by humans, (2) mathematics can describe the natural world, (3) the universe has only physical components ... among several other assumptions. <br /> <br />None of these things has been (or can be) proven scientifically, but are taken on faith, so as to confer authority on flawed human beings.  The history of the 20th century provides almost endless evidence of the consequences of faith in science (humans). <br /> <br />What the author is doing is confusing faith with fascism, while not recognizing he is advancing just another form of fascism.
B00097DXZS|2.0|As you know, this is Santana's third CD of mostly \\"duets\\".  The first, Supernatural was very good.  Shaman and this one are not so good. <br /> <br />Of the 13 tracks, 4 are standard Santana band compositions.  All 4 are very good.  If the rest of the ablum were like those, than this would be a 4 to 5 star album. <br /> <br />Most of the \\"duets\\" are not very good.  They are not really duets.  They are an artist playing music, with Santana's guitar poorly dubbed over the song. <br /> <br />These songs are not about two artists getting together and collaborating on some music.  It is like Santana has never really met most of these people.  The guests recorded their tracks in places like LA and New York, while Santana was in the Bay Area.   <br /> <br />It doesn't work at all.  It really just sounds like Santana's guitar was stuck on top of these songs.  It sounds ridiculous in parts.  Like as if you were at home, playing a CD and pulling out your guitar and playing along.  If Santana's guitar weren't on these songs, it wouldn't be noticed, or in some cases, the songs would be better. <br /> <br />Some of the songs are really bad.  The Steven Tyler song is a bad 1980's type corporate rocker, and Santana plays some of the worst guitar of his career.  Los Lonely Boys are just annoying.  (I know, I know, many people like this boy band crap). <br /> <br />The only real good duet is the one with Mary J Blige.   <br /> <br />Overdubbing has been done since almost the beginning of recorded music.  And there have been many successful albums that have been recorded in different studios.  But these are all about artists sharing a vision.  On this album, it is just a producer running around, slapping things together. <br /> <br />Note that Santana has a very long history of collaborating with other artists.  In concert, he always brought out the warm up band to jam on his encores.  When Santana was the warm up band for Eric Clapton, they would always have a super jam at the end of the show.  Santana has had duet albums with other musicians, like John McLaughlin and Buddy Miles.  He has had guest musicians do songs, like Willie Nelson on Havana Moon.  But, these were always collarborations of artists working closely together, not phoning it in from different parts of the country.
0393057658|5.0|MONEYBALL takes us inside the office of general manager (GM) Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics for the 2002 season. Beane needs to compete for talented free agent players, but his small-market team has lower ticket and broadcast revenues than most other clubs.  Despite the financial disadvantage, Beane manages to compete successfully against George Steinbrenner's Yankees and other big-market teams.  How?  By astute scouting, measuring player performance against price, and by judging player worth with oft-ignored but highly significant statistics like on base and slugging percentages.  The result?  At this writing, the Athletics have made the playoffs or at least contended every year since 1999, despite losing top players like Jason Giambi and Johnny Damon. Ironically, the book knocks GM Ken Williams of the White Sox, whose team won the World Series in 2005 on a moderate player payroll.  There is also a discussion about scouting, and how many scouts prefer chiseled young prospects and reject those kids that are too thick or thin. Guess they never heard of Babe Ruth or Ted Williams.     <br /> <br />Author Michael Lewis' flowing prose makes this a very  appealing read. MONEY BALL should be of great interest to fans, rotisserie/fantasy league players, and anybody with an interest in the economics of the game. <br />
B00005JOII|5.0|I have not seen too many Woody Allen movies, and those that I have seen have been fairly recent and fairly poor (Small Time Crooks).  I have never seen Annie Hall or Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex (But Was Afraid To Ask), but I hear that they are amazing.  After seeing Match Point, which many critics consider to be Allen's return to grace, I now want to see his older films, because if they are half as good as this, then they'll be amazing.  Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an Irish tennis pro at a London country club.  While he was once on the pro tour, he left because he felt that he didn't have the skill or the luck.  You see, Wilton firmly believes in luck, and the opening narration, involving a tennis ball hitting the net, is a very powerful theme throughout the film.  Wilton states that when the ball hits the net during a match, there is a split second when it bounces up.  The ball can either bounce forward into the opponent's court and give you the point, or bounce back, causing you to lose.  Chris begins teaching a wealthy client named Thomas Hewitt (Matthew Goode), and the pair quickly become friends.  Chris is introduced to the Hewitt family; father Alec (Brian Cox), mother Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), and sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer).  The Hewitts seem to have everything Chris never had when he was growing up; Chris came from a poorer family, and the Hewitts have everything.  Soon, Chloe and Chris start a relationship, and Chris starts to experience how the upper class lives.  Chloe's family like Chris a lot, and Alec comments on his pride that Chris was able to rise up the social ladder on his own merits throughout life.  However, his world is thrown for a loop when he meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson), an American actress who is engaged to Tom.  She is a bit of a seductress, and she knows it.  Chris is drawn to Nola, and, due to some outside circumstances involving Eleanor, the two begin an affair.  Things only get worse when Chrisand Chloe get married, and, soon after, Tom breaks it off with Nola.  What follows is an interesting look at affairs, and the things Chris will do to keep both women.  Chris loves Chloe and he doesn't want to hurt her feelings, but he needs Nola in his life.  He goes to great lengths in order to rekindle their affair.  However, it isn't just Chloe that is keeping him in the marriage.  He claims to have gotten bored with her, and her desire for a child makes him uneasy.  However, Alec got him a job in one of his companies, and now Chris is used to living a certain way.  He has a beautiful apartment overlooking the Thames, as well as every luxury he could wish for.  Meanwhile, Nola is living in a poor neighborhood, and her desire to have the life that Tom could have provided for her begins to make her dependent on Chris as opposed to the other way around.  The movie is very darkly comedic, and all the little nuances work very well.  Even when things get very dark towards the end, the humor is still present.  The cast does a great job in all of their roles, convincingly portraying the emotions people go through in the situations that they run in to.  Furthermore, the soundtrack is both appropriate and distinctive.  The only music used is opera, and as the tension mounts throughout the film, the music gets more and more dramatic.  This film is a great way to start off 2006, and should be a must-see.
0767805712|5.0|\\"Gattaca\\" may well be the sci-fi movie with the most gorgeous art direction yet made. Make sure you see it in a wide-screen version. The expansive, minimalist, vaguely art deco settings glow golden in a kind of persistent late afternoon light. The perfect hairdos, impeccable suits and beautiful people blend perfectly into the shiny surroundings, as does Uma Thurman's peculiarly expressionless face. There are no lame attempts at futurism or obligatory CG effects to draw attention away from the story - a story that has an unabashedly philosophical portent, much like \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave new world\\".<br /><br />Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, like any company of note in this \\"not too distant future\\", is a workplace that employs only genetically perfect people. In fact, social life in its entirety is governed by genetics - if a girl wants to check whether her boyfriend is suitable marriage material, she merely has to take one of his hairs to a counter, where she is soon provided with a complete print of his genetic code.<br /><br />All the worse for Vincent (Ethan Hawke), who was born of parents who, romantically, wanted a naturally conceived rather than a genetically engineered baby. So he is born an \\"in-valid\\", with flawed genes, and finds the way to his dream, becoming a space traveller, blocked before he has even started on it. Yet, out in the sea on one of his swimming contests against his genetically superior brother, he finds that he is not necessarily the loser every time. So he decides to pursue his dream against all odds. Through will power, stamina, and the help of a shadowy middle man who makes a living supplying in-valids with a valid identity, Vincent gets where he wants to be, and where we find him at the beginning of the movie. He borrows the identity of a crippled swimmer, played by Jude Law. Their mutual dependency results in surprising insights for both, and some tensions as well; - especially when, in the wake of a murder case, Vincent finds his true identity on the verge of being revealed. At the same time, falling in love with his co-worker Irene (Thurman), he has a hard time matching up the required sincerity with his fake identity.<br /><br />These plotlines are developed quietly, unhurriedly and without any sensationalism. No matter how detached the tone of the movie is, you find yourself touched by the characters, who each in their own way are sympathetic, some of them surprisingly so. The acting of the three leads is excellent and thoroughly believable. The wonderful, haunting score by Michael Nyman further hightens the impact of what is ultimately a very moving film, that surely deserves wider fame than it currently enjoys. This and \\"Contact\\" are as yet the only two must-see sci-fi movies I've come across.e verge of being revealed.

B000066NW0|4.0|While I tend to dislike the pop variety of rock today, Avril manages to break the barrier with the catchiness of her vocal manipulation and melodies. Originally I was only attracted to this CD because of the irresistible hit \\"Complicated\\", but one listen proved that the rest of the album was equally impressive (with a couple of exceptions). I had previously been unaware that Avril had any hard rock songs to offer, yet apparently she has quite a few of them: including my two favorites on Let Go, \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"Unwanted\\". Although \\"Losing Grip\\" is a bit similar to the future hit \\"Don't Tell Me\\" with its lyrical flow, I find it much more appealing due to its use of some interesting sound effects and the fact that it has a painfully catchy chorus that I never tire of. I wish that this song would get more air play and expose people to Avril's hard side, yet I've only heard it on the radio once (in a gas station). While \\"Losing Grip\\" is my favorite Avril song, \\"Unwanted\\" is my second favorite of hers. This track is equally heavy on the guitars and is admirable for its use of mournful yet appealing lyrics which sound phenomenal when combined with the might of the guitar progressions. Although I instantly fell for the loud tracks like these, the soft songs on Let Go took a longer time for me to appreciate since I'm mainly a hard core rock guy. They do still seem a tad weak to me since they are less complex and do not instantly grab attention, but their rhythmic goodness does earn my approval. For these reasons, I would give Avril's debut album a four star rating and would certainly recommend it: especially to those who are not yet acquainted with her more noisy pieces.
B000286RKW|5.0|After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where \\"The Godfather\\" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. \\"Goodfellas\\" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\", which debuted nine years after this movie was made. \\"Goodfellas\\" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss \\"Big Paulie\\" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, \\"made man\\" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.<br />What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kid's birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.
0385486804|4.0|I love pretty much everything Krakauer has ever done, and this book is no exception. I read this after I read Into Thin Air and Under the Banner of Heaven, and I have to say that Krakauer's writing style is pretty much my favorite of any nonfiction author. There's a down-to-earth straightforwardness and humbleness that is really engaging and also endearing. I don't know whether he would find that flattering, but for me it's the truth. Krakauer's books are so engaging it's difficult to keep track of time when you're reading them. <br /> <br />I have to say, however, that unlike the characters in Into Thin Air, I had very little sympathy or warm feeling for the protagonist of this book, Into the Wild, and no amount of Krakauer's apologies or explanations of the boy's actions could change that. <br /> <br />I live in New Mexico and my parents took my brother and I camping, hiking, fishing and hunting starting at a young age. And from the very first time we ever went \\"into the wild\\" my father and mother were very careful to point out to us that nature, while beautiful, was not our friend. My dad put it best one time: \\"Nature is indifferent about whether or not you survive out here. If you get into trouble, don't count on Nature to help you. It won't. Survival will be entirely up to you.\\"  <br /> <br />Like Alaska, we get a lot of people in New Mexico who haven't internalized that message. They wander out into the desert or up into the mountains, looking to commune with the Eagle Spirit or the Sun God or just test their own mettle, and wind up in desperate straits that other people have to rescue them from, or they end up dead. In my opinion, Chris McCandless was no different or better than any of the other independence-seeking, overconfident, idealistic nature-loving morons who wander out into the wilderness and get into trouble.  <br /> <br />And ultimately, that's why it was hard for me to accept Krakauer's analysis of McCandless' actions. What was offensive to me wasn't that McCandless wanted to test himself or get away from the world. I understand those impulses very well. I understand wanderlust and the need to travel, because when you travel, you can be anyone. You can do anything. Like McCandless, seeing new things and meeting new people is a big driver for me in my life. I understand the need for independence and the need to find out who you are separate from who your parents want you to be. What I can't understand or have empathy for is McCandless' incredible arrogance and hubris. He threw himself out into thin air and hoped Mother Nature would be there to catch him. For all his blathering about going up against nature and proving himself, it's obvious he saw nature as a benevolent force that would help him out if he got into a jam. That was just an incredibly stupid thing to think, there's no two ways about it. Naive doesn't begin to cover McCandless, and it's hard to have sympathy for someone who not only was ignorant but refused to listen to the advice and expertise of the experienced people who tried to help him.  <br /> <br />I know there are probably a lot of people out there who admire people like McCandless and some who probably want to follow in his footsteps, only believing that they, unlike him, could make it out of the wild alive. That's the danger of books as good as this one - people may read them and think that because they can identify McCandless' mistakes, they can do what he did better and their own shortcomings don't matter. All I can say is that no matter how tough you think you are, nature is tougher, and going out into wilderness without a map, decent provisions, and some way of contacting the outside world (even if it's a signal flare) is asking for trouble. Ultimately, the only good thing about McCandless' lonely death is that he didn't end up in a situation where some search and rescue person would have to come after him, and possibly lose his or her life. When people wander out alone into the wild, they need to understand they are putting not only themselves at risk, but anyone who may have to go after them and bring them back. That's why I have so little sympathy for McCandless - he recklessly endangered himself, causing endless pain for his family, and did not seem to understand the position he was putting other people in - people who cared about him and later had to bear guilt over his death. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating read and a must-read for any armchair adventurer who is even considering heading out into nature themselves, even for a camping trip. It's not only a compelling story, it's an amazing cautionary tale for anyone who thinks they're tougher than what the wilderness can dish out.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|When i first bought city of evil i loved it, but after listning to more of their older stuff i have to say that this one takes the whole bakery.  Awsome guitar duos and melodies that stick in your head id say that makes for great music. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks... <br /> <br />1.I won't see you tonight (pt.1&2) <br />2.remenissions <br />and i guess well all of them
B000001DTM|5.0|This CD start to finish is full of great tracks.  Not a single clunker in this collection.  I'm a fan, but can admit that their albums prior to and since all have at least one or two weak tracks.  Not this one, from \\"Even Better\\" to \\"the Fly\\" to \\"One\\" to \\"Who's Gonna Ride\\"... all really solid.  Production values are excellent.  Songwriting is- great Bono's lyrics are less preachy but no less sincere or serious here.  The Edge and est of the band hit their stride musically with an edgy, yet still uniquely U2 sound.
B000002MP2|5.0|I never would have expected such a phenomenal album to follow Green Day's \\"Kerplunk\\", which I consider to be the band's worst. Dookie is full of endlessly catchy music, rhythmic wonders, and justifiably popular hit songs. \\"Longview\\", one of my all-time favorite Green Day songs, is especially great for its good bass usage, well-written lyrics, unique drum sound, and righteously noisy chorus. I also especially like the non-hit track \\"Coming Clean\\", which is brief but has an awesome chord progression, great lyrical and vocal management, and is perhaps Green Day's catchiest tune. Unfortunately, this song is one of few highlights on the second half of the album, which seems like it is not as timetaken as the first half. \\"When I Come Around\\" is actually one of my least favorite Green Day tunes, since the guitar pattern seems to just drag on for the entirety of the song. The hidden track after \\"F.O.D.\\" is an even bigger letdown, for it features Billie Joe seemingly imitating Ernie from Sesame Street (maybe that's why Ernie is featured on the back of the C.D. amidst a crowd) in a very annoying voice. The melody itself is also really lame, and I'd easily consider it to be Green Day's all-time worst. Excluding this song, though, I pretty much like every song on Dookie. For Green Day fans such as myself this album is obviously essential, since it basically introduced the band to the music world with its popularity. Buy Dookie if you don't have it!
B00004Z459|1.0|This is the crap that killed Nu-Metal & opened the flood gates for other limp wristed \\"Nu Metal\\" (im 15 & did poo poo in my diaper) bands to flood our airwaves with their lets get weally weally angry and scream in the verse, then sing in the chorus & over expose our music! If you a little kid then purchase this crap, if you a little older then 5 & like the whole rap/rock thing then i suggest Rage Against The Machine, but be warned they dont wear name brands t-shirts, DC runners, advertise Pepsi & they can be little political...
B000002TQV|5.0|I think this is as good as OK Computer. Every song on this CD is outstanding. A must have for any Radiohead listener...
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I would have to say that Waking the Fallen is their best release but this ones still good.  Although not as heavy as past albums the musician ship is still there and so is the kick-ass guitar, and thats what really matters.  Its very differant from most metal-ish albums because you find yourself actually  \\"singing\\" along with just about the whole thing.
B0006399FS|3.0|Perhaps it is due to Bono's unending effort to save the poor in Africa.  Perhaps it is Larry and Adam's seemingly increasing disdain for Rock Stardom (at least the part where you have to interact with those who pay your salary or act like you give a crap when performing live).  Or perhaps the Edge has just run out of ideas.  Apparently they cut the wrong wire when trying to dismantle this bomb of an album.  Don't get me wrong, Vertigo, Sometimes You Can't Make it, and All Because of You are better than average songs, but overall this CD is lame, uninteresting and tedious to listen to start to finish.  The whole buying into Apple/Ipod thing apparently has U2 thinking about shooting for 2-3 good tracks per CD to be downloaded.  The rest is filler worthy of far lesser bands.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning distinguishes itself from previous Green Day CDs in a number of ways. For one thing, there is a significantly less amount of language on this album, indicating that Green Day is not attempting to give a harder rock feel to the CD like they have done for such releases as Nimrod and Dookie. Instead, Warning tries some new things out such as mildly folkish tracks (Hold On) and contemplative calm pieces such as \\"Macy's Day Parade\\". The song I like most on Warning is definitely \\"Blood, Sex, and Booze\\", which is my second favorite of all existent Green Day tunes (my favorite being either \\"She's A Rebel\\" or \\"Give Me Novacaine\\"). This track has a good bass riff in the background, an amazingly catchy chord progression, and creative inclusion of a mandolin for a couple seconds. If you've read my other Green Day reviews, you may have noticed I've used the word \\"catchy\\" in every one. That's because nearly every song Green Day has made is just unbelievably catchy lyrically, vocally, melodically, and in every way imaginable. I have yet to hear a song by them that I absolutely despise. Anyway, Warning is also good for its variety. Just like on the Shenanigans CD, basically every melody on this album has some instrument or rhythm that the others do not have: an attribute that surely gains my approval. To conclude, Warning ranks quite highly among other Green Day CDs yet is considerably different. Some of the group's best songs can be found on this album, and I would thus give Warning five stars.
0060512806|3.0|Cryptonomicon, which has been well-summarized in other reviews, is several books in one: we go back and forth between Randy in the fairly recent past, in the Phillippines, and Bobby Shaftoe and Lawrence Waterhouse during WWII.  It's interesting that the more Stephenson seems to think of his characters, the less likeable they become--by far the most likeable is Bobby Shaftoe, the most average of the bunch.  Waterhouse, a brilliant mathmetician, is all right, and Randy, a computer expert, is incredibly annoying.  I found myself really only enjoying the half of the book that was set in the past--when we skipped forward to the future and back to Randy's snide comments about his ex's literary taste and snobbish judgements of the less computer-gifted people around him, well--the modern section was by far the weakest part of the book.  This was aided drastically by something I believe other reviwers have mentioned--the women in this book are very poorly developed.  Almost every time a woman is mentioned, some sexual reference to her is made within five lines.  It seems like women in Cryptonomicon exist only as sexual partners for the men. <br /> <br />The other really really annoying thing about this book was the constant use of the term \\"Nippon\\" for Japan and \\"Nipponese\\" for Japanese.  This is not a term in common usage in Japan--a country which calls itself Nihon and its people Nihonjin (a different reading).  Stephenson's use of an older, more militaristic reading (that was more common during WWII) seems again a bit snobbish, like he's pointing out how much smarter his characters are than his readers. <br /> <br />Certainly this is true in my case--a lot of the puzzles are things I could not solve, and was not particularly interested in reading five pages about.  The novel is complex and, as with the much stronger Baroque Cycle, excitingly researched.  However, it is flawed in such a way that I found myself getting more and more annoyed on every page.  Read it, sure, but be ready to skim.
B00000AFDW|4.0|The Psycho Circus CD is historic because it is the first time in over fifteen years that the original line-up had recorded together. After several listens, it seems as though they're attempting to, not so much duplicate, but construct an updated version of 1976's Destroyer. Similar to Detroit Rock City, the title cut (written by Paul Stanley) has a palpable air of drama. Experimenting with Sergeant Pepper-esque settings, while keeping a hard rock edge on cuts like Within, and Journey of 1000 Years, Gene Simmons seems to be venturing into Beatles territory. Featuring a smoking hot solo, Into the Void, is enjoyably typical Ace Frehley fodder. Peter Criss is represented with the ballad, I Finally Found My Way, and Paul is in classic form on I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock & Roll. If my theory is correct about KISS attempting to update Destroyer, then I feel that they succeeded on one level, but missed the mark on another. Destroyer was written and conceived by men in their 20s hungry for a hit, whereas Psycho Circus was concocted by wealthy men nearing 50 attempting to duplicate what they had written out of their collective systems two decades before. While the CD ranks with Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, and Revenge, upon repeated listens, it does come off as a little \\"calculated\\".
B00007KWHN|5.0|Mandatory ROCK album!!! <br /> <br />It cant get any better..CLASSIC STUFF!!! <br /> <br />And of course the BASS will just eat yer face..it sound's like 20 tank's..see REAL rock/metal is BASS driven..the BASS is the center to a great band in my book!! one of the best BASS player's ever!! <br /> <br />Really unique, thought provoking, imaginative..BUY IT!!!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I came across Old Boy at my video store when I was running out of movies to rent and decided to try a different genre. Right from the beginning this movie intrigued me (I watched the dubbed version first) by the voice of the narrated dialogue of this frustrated Dae-Sue who wakes up captive in an apartment after an obnoxious drunken night at the police station. He doesn't know why he has been kidnapped, but never gives up and only becomes angrier and set on revenge. He ended-up a total of 15 years in this apartment eating fried dumplings and fairly well taken care of.  The movie has surreal undertones and has striking cinematography as well as beautiful western classical music playing in the background. There are also some pretty decent action fights when Dae-sue becomes free and while seeking revenge takes on several men at a time with a hammer while he has a knife sticking from his back.  He meets a young girl named Mido, and eventually meets and finds the man responsible for his 15 year kidnapping (after tasting all the fried dumplings in town, since that's all he ate for 15 years, and that's how he makes the connection). Woo-Jin, who also performs excellently, gives Dae-su 5 days to figure out the puzzle or Mido will die, but I'm not going any further.   This movie is brilliant because it has humor, action, a love story (not too much unnecessary sex), great music, a brutal, and haunting twist at the very end. The plot is unusual since it begins in a way that is somewhat predictable, then goes a different way that is somewhat perplexing, but if you sit it out all comes together marvelously at the end. The second time I watched this movie with subtitles, and agree that it had a better effect.  When you watch this movie pay attention to when Woo-Jin says \\"When you live for revenge and once you get it, you still have to live with the pain\\".
B000002TQB|4.0|I own all of Blur's CDs, and actually I would say this is one of the lesser issues (the least being the band's debut album). At this early point in Blur's history, there is much less application of the neat sound effects evident on the albums \\"Blur\\" and \\"13\\", and the majority of the melodies have little catchiness. Not to say that Parklife isn't a good CD, though, because it certainly is. Parklife is very commendable for its plainspoken variety, with a wide variety of musical styles that venture from moseying tracks like \\"Parklife\\" to succinct scrambling pieces like \\"Bank Holiday\\". In addition to this, there are interesting factors such as a guest appearance of the Stereolab vocalist, organ sessions (which cannot be found on other Blur albums), and video game noises in the song \\"Jubilee\\". This CD also features one of Blur's more prominent pieces, \\"Girls & Boys\\". This track contains an odd yet decidedly memorable chorus, electronic patterns, and a highly entertaining vocal rhythm throughout. Parklife establishes itself apart from other Blur albums in that it contains a lot of organ, much usage of a specific electronic sound effect, synthesizers, and the occasional violin and horn, yet is mildly comparable to my second favorite Blur CD: \\"The Great Escape\\" with the majority of its rhythms. All in all, Parklife is a fine album and I would consider it essential in at least any Blur fan's collection.
B0000TB050|5.0|This DVD truly captures what it feels like to be at a U2 concert.  U2 is one of the most amazing rock bands live and we see that here.  This concert was filmed in Dublin outside of Slane Castle.  There are some great shots of the band with the castle in the background. What truly separates this DVD from others is the band's mood as well as the enthusiasm of the crowd.  There were over 80,000 people at this concert.  U2 was truly happy to be back home and it clearly showed.  There is a real connection in this DVD with the crowd.  This DVD captures the raw emotion that one feels when going to a U2 concert; the transformation from being a spectator to an active participant of the U2 experience.  Yes, U2 is a great band.  Bono is one of the best singers around with a beautiful voice.  The Edge is one of the best guitar players in the Rock world.  But this one is about having a good time at a great concert.<br /><br />There are some great performances on this DVD.  The concert opens with an energetic performance of Elevation.  The crowd is abosolutely energized.  Another great performance is Until the End of the World.  Bono's cranks up the vocals in New Year's Day.  He sings it with great emotion.  A true highlight of the concert is Out of Control.  Bono acts as if U2 is a new band introducing their first single.  He screams \\"We hope you like it\\" and brilliantly starts singing the song.  He later introduces each band member and where they are from.  As the song slows down, he thanks each parent of the band for giving them 500 pounds so they can get their music career going.  He then thanks the crowd for giving them at least 500 pounds each day and roars back into the song with the crowd going into a frenzy.  Really breathtaking.<br /><br />Almost every song is worth talking about on this DVD.  I only will discuss 2 more.  U2 delivers a brilliant performance of All I Want is You.  It is a truly romantic love song that is shared by couples as \\"their song\\".  Bono dedicates this song to his wife.  The vocals and music are truly a thing of beauty.  Bono gets the crowd to chant along with him on this song.  Eventually, the music stops.  Bono and the crowd continue to chant back and forth.  As this is going on, we hear the familiar begining of Where the Streets Have No Name.  This is the highlight of the concert.  As the lights start flashing and the Edges guitars begin to rev up, Bono starts running around the stage which extends into the crowd.  The crowd goes into a frenzy and Bono starts singing.  You could barely hear Bono singing because the crowd is singing along so loud with him.  Truly incredible performance.  An even better perfomance of Where the Streets Have No Name is recorded on the Boston tour DVD.  That version of the song may be the best live performance of a song that I have ever seen.  The U2 Go Home DVD may be the best recorded concert ever.  If you're a U2 fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a fan, you will be after watching this concert.ates this song to his wife.

1904920209|5.0|Well, I found another gem...this book is just plain lovely.  Richard Bertinet loves to bake bread. And he passes this on to the reader through his style, technique and results. Very clear explainations of ingredients, procedures, time required and with beautiful pictures on quality paper. Oh, and you get an instructional CD. It just doesn't get much better.     I have been baking bread for almost thirty years.  Not always regularly since my kids are older, but enough to still love to learn a thing or two, or more from this book about flours, fresh yeast, a different way to work the dough.  Not an all-inclusive book on bread, but rather a book of just what the title says, simple contemporary bread. I don't know that there is anything radically different in this book; it simply inspires and excites: Not too bad in itself.  It also helps you to make darned good bread.  The Fougasse is worth the price of the book alone.    Even if you have never baked a loaf in your life, give this a look. This book takes bread baking to exactly what it is: Flour, yeast, water, salt and your hands. This is not rocket science, this is simple, classy comfort.  Perfect.
B00005UW9T|5.0|Anastasia is a movie that has everything: adventure, romance, humor and horror. It is a great movie for people of all ages, and everytime I watch it I fall in love with Dimitri. Though, as is apparent from the first minute, it is not historically accurate, it is still a fabulous movie. The soundtrack is unbeatable, I love to sing along to it while driving. Anastasia is recommended for all, you'll be left with the satisfied feeling that a good movie gives.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love period pieces.  There is nothing greater than to be transported into an era that is different from this one.  I am a sucker for historical novels and enjoy imagining the scenery, clothing and characters of those times, but watching them come to life on my television could be just as wonderful.  I bought the BBC DVD called North and South because of all the rave reviews here.  Oh. My. God!  This has got to be one of, if not the best historical mini-series I have ever watched.  It is right up there with Pride and Prejudice and a few Spanish-language historical \\"telenovelas\\" I've seen over the years.  This is the series adaptation of the classic Elizabeth Gaskell novel (which I read almost ten years ago) about Margaret Hale, the beautiful daughter of a middle-class clergyman and her sudden departure from the southern countryside to the seedy world of factories and tradesmen in the north of England.  Milton is quite a different world from what she is accustomed to, especially when she meets the Thornton family, namely the disarming cotton manufacturer Mr. John Thornton, whom she sees as uncouth and uneducated based on his ill treatment to one of his employees.  When Mr. Thornton becomes one of her father's pupils, feelings ensue between them, but pride and prejudice keep them from getting close.  To his annoyance, Margaret befriends a family of steel workers whose main breadwinner is leading an union that will enable manufacturers to increase their underlings' wagers.  This does not sit well with Thornton, for his business is in trouble...<br /><br />This wonderful Victorian love story set against the backdrop of the industrialized England is one beautiful surprise!  I used the \\"pride and prejudice\\" thing on purpose because the plot is vaguely similar to the Jane Austen novel.  In fact, there was a particular scene that reminded me a great deal of the proposal/rejection scene in P&P, only this one is more heartfelt.  Despite the comparisons, North and South is a memorable story in its own right.  Daniela Anby-Ashe is wonderful as the spirited Margaret Hale.  Brendan Coyle was compelling in his portrayal of the sweet-natured and determined union leader Nicholas Higgins, Sinead Cusack was incredible in her role of the proud and protective mother Hannah Thornton, and Jo Joyner does a good job in playing the snobbish and annoying sister Fanny Thornton.  But it is Richard Armitage that took my breath away in his role of Mr. Thornton.  He brought the hero with a tough and brutal exterior but with a heart of gold to life!  He also brings a great deal of sensuality to his character using his beautiful eyes.  Mr. Armitage is not handsome in a conventional way, but his eyes, smoky voice and nuance portrayal of a flawed romantic hero has drawn many female viewers to him, including me. Swoon.  He is right up there with Colin Firth when it comes to adding sex appeal to his acting.  He is a gifted, wonderful actor and I shall look forward to watching something else with him in it in the future.  As for the mini-series, the story is wonderfully woven and executed.  The story doesn't follow the novel through and through though.  Some changes were made and I think Thornton is more complex and in depth here than he was in the book.  The ending is also different from the novel, but I enjoyed this ending because it kept the overall romantic feel of this adaptation.  There are several memorable scenes in this series.  My personal favorite is the one where Thornton says, \\"Look back at me.\\"  (You'll see what I mean when you watch the film.  Sigh.) As for the other aspects of the series, I enjoyed getting a glimpse of the seedy world of Milton and its inhabitants, and the wardrobe and scenery are beautiful!  The cinematography is amazing.  I marvel at the lighting and how it set the mood when they changed from the colorful scenes in the countryside cottage to the dark and gloomy ones in Milton.  The music scores also set the perfect tone for the scenes.  You can tell just how much attention to detail went into the filming process.  I cannot recommend North and South enough.  Hollywood hasn't created something this beautiful in a long time.  It appears that I will have to look to BBC for wonderful acting, gorgeous sets and beautiful stories whenever I'm in the mood for a period piece.  I look forward to watching more novel adaptations like this one.cenes.  You can tell just how much attention to detail went into the filming process.  I cannot recommend North and South enough.

B000002GWJ|5.0|First off, I'm a Tom Waits junkie.  So if I appear slightly biased, it's because I am.  <br />I have been acquiring all the Tom Waits music I can and have everything that's available.  Since I had most of the songs on this cd on other cds, I had passed this one by. What a mistake!  If the only song on the cd was \\"Kentucky Avenue\\" it would be well worth the cost and the effort.  This song sung by someone else, without the voice and the sincerity of Mr. Waits might have sounded like a cheap effort to bring on the tears, but his delivery is so touching I feel like I'm eavesdroping on a special and private conversation.  It's a story really of what would seem to be a 9 year old or so talking to a friend, sharing gossip and making big plans.  The love and tenderness being shown by one friend to another is devestating.  It goes beyond touching the listener's heart, and goes straight to the listener's soul.   <br />The same goes for \\"$29 and an Alligator Purse\\", \\"Blue Valentine\\" -- there's not a bad song in the bunch.  The background music is some of the best blues ever played. <br />I can't imagine anyone buying this cd and being dissappointed with it.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|I love Sia.  She is absolutely fabulous!  A true trip-hop goddess.  Many of you may already be very familiar with her gorgeous, yet unusual, voice from her work with the fabulous electronic/trip-hop/downtempo collaborative group that is Zero 7, but her solo work is amazing as well.   <br /> <br />I love Sia's first solo album, Healing is Difficult, the best, but this one is a razor-thin close second and it absolutely NOT TO BE MISSED.  You must pick this one up for \\"Breathe Me\\" alone (and its additional remixes - the reason I bought this although I already have the original import copy of this CD, which did not have the additional \\"Breathe Me\\" tracks).  \\"Breathe Me\\", of course, is the incredibly haunting song from the last five minutes of the series finale of Six Feet under.  It is intensely beautiful, and will stay with you for a long, long time after hearing it.  It will burn your soul. <br /> <br />Of course, \\"Breathe Me\\" is the not the only great track here.  I love pretty much every song on this album, but \\"Sunday\\", \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\", \\"Natale's Song\\", and \\"Where I Belong\\" are personal favorites that rank up there very close to \\"Breathe Me\\".   <br /> <br />Buy this NOW, NOW, NOW.  You will not be disappointed, even if \\"Breathe Me\\" is your only song of interest.
0553213105|1.0|I may be trying too hard to read a classic book.. I thought P&P would be a  good start since they just made another movie on this book.. but I was wrong! the book was boring and plotless. Sure nowaday women are still searching for Mr.Perfect like Lizzy was. But today's women have to deal with much more complicated life problems and worries while searching for the right guy.. The whole book was about drawing room,dinners, and occasional conversations with some ladies urging Lizzy to get married. I better off stick with the modern love stories with real people problems.  Glad women have grown so much tougher since the old days.

For you readers out there, combine the ideology of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" with the combativeness of \\"The Matrix\\" and you get this excellent genre-defying  movie \\"Equilibrium.\\" <br /> <br />Summary:  Bale is a First Class Cleric of the \\"Grammaton Cleric\\" in the fascist world of our future.  His job is to eradicate any form of art or rebel that creates/encourages emotion, thus his job is also entitled the \\"Thought Police\\".  To help people to have no emotions, Prozium is made to have in the form of a shot everyday.  Of course, Bale forgets his dose and soon becomes one of the \\"rebels\\" he has once hunted.  His eyes have been opened to the loss of his loved ones, to music, and to friendship.  His mind has been filled with the meaning of music, art, and color and now he must avenge those he has sworn to eradicate........... <br /> <br />Man, even my own review gets me pumped up about watching the movie again!!  There's amazing fight scenes that will displace images from \\"The Matrix\\" out of your mind, and a storyline that will have your heart skipping beats 'til the end.  In some scenes you'll think it's over, but you'll realize that it's not.  GET THIS MOVIE!!!! <br /> <br />Sean Bean fans are not going to like the first ten minutes of the movie....trust me, I'm a fan of him.  But hopefully, like me, you'll get over it fast. <br /> <br />John
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I had always enjoyed Stargate SG1 and wondered what the spin off Stargate Atlantis would be like.  I was pleasantly surprised and Atlantis is a terrific series in its own right. <br /> <br />What makes this box set exceptional are the commentaries which seem to be on a majority of the episodes.  They are not only informative but also exceedingly entertaining and very funny.  As someone who doesn't often listen to the commentaries, I can highly recommend them on this set.
B00005JOFO|3.0|Here we are in 2006 and the people of the \\"Free World\\" cannot even legalize gay marriage.  Even the people of Massachusetts cannot fully support the idea!  Spain, the second most roman-catholic country in the world finds nothing wrong with love shared equally.  But America does.  That is our reality.  Matthew Shepard was murdered in Wyoming in 1998, and since that time, nothing has changed.  All we can think about is \\"Gitin 'er done\\".    <br /> <br />I saw this movie and all it did for me was support the fear that I face every day of my life.  A great movie... unfortunate reality.
B000000OU0|3.0|However, if you have been an Eagles fan since 1974 (like myself), this was somewhat of a disappointment. The first four tracks (new studio recordings) are OK, but NOT great.  As for the live tracks, I wanted to hear \\"Already Gone\\", \\"Lyin Eyes\\", and \\"Take It To The Limit\\"...or even \\"Seven Bridges Road\\", but the Eagles took the safe route and used the majority of songs from their best selling album \\"Hotel California\\" in hopes of commercial success (which worked). Because lets face it, this album wasn't for the fans...it was for the money!! \\"Hell\\" didn't freeze over...someones assets did and, subsequently, the Eagles were forced to reunite to cash-in on the nostalgic appeal of a reunion that was \\"never gonna happen\\".   <br /> <br />Dont get me wrong, as an Eagles fan I enjoy anything that puts all the original players on one stage...but I dont think that \\"Hotel California\\" is the quintesential Eagle's album. Even if I did, Henley's voice on \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" sounded tired and pathetic, and they left out \\"New Kid In Town\\", which was the best song on the HC album next to \\"Victim of Love\\" (which also didn't make this live recording)!!   <br /> <br />Like I said, if you loved Hotel California \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" may be worth buying, but I cannot give it more than 3 stars because I truly feel this album was a half-baked attempt to capture a reunion concert that was WAY over-hyped, and it short-changed the older fans by filling the first 1/3 of the album with new (and lackluster) studio tracks and omitting classics. <br /> <br />  Unfortunately for yours truly, this album sealed its doom by ending with the one song I've hated since someone decided to make a crappy TV movie about it...\\"Desperado\\".   \\"Of course,\\"...as Dennis Miller used to say...\\"that's just my opinion. I could be wrong\\".
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Joey <br />Sid <br />Paul <br />James <br />Clown <br />Mick <br />Chris <br />133-(what the hell??) <br />Corey <br /> <br />(Usually I put what instruments they play, but the cd info doesn't provide me with that information.) <br /> <br />Well, first of all...based on this cd, I truthfully don't like Slipknot.  But all I have to say is they have gotten REALLY far in the music industry, and I shall give them kudos for achieving that task.  Otherwise, I don't like this cd. <br /> <br />When I first was informed of Slipknot, by the way people were describing them, I thought they'd be another Killswitch, Lamb of God, or even Soilwork.  But I guess this cd trashed my hopes.  Musically the album is standard issue radio metal, melodically repetitive, and the lyrics are the same hate and blood shriek kind of thing you'd expect in \\"nu metal\\"......with a touch of horrible distorted vocals.  Based on the chorus of \\"Duality\\", it seems as though \\"The Sickness\\" (lead singer's gay nickname) has some talent, but he distorts it and destroys the true atmosphere that he could potentially produce.  In some songs, he even sounds like the singer for System of a Down, who is a pathetic vocalist.  I can't stand his voice at all.....but anyways... <br /> <br />\\"Duality\\" is a radio hit in my town, and that is the reason I bought this cd.  \\"Duality\\" has good guitars, and a catchy chorus which reminded me of Killswitch.  Excluding the intro distorted vocals, it was an alright song.  Distorted vocals are like the definition of \\"nu metal\\" bands and I don't think Slipknot is trying to shoot for that.  Otherwise, all of the other songs are horrible. <br /> <br />Another thing that bugs me is the transfer of production.  The music sounds like it has horrible production in parts, but in others it's crystal clear.  It has an uttermost effect on the drum parts, especially the double bass.  The double bass sounds like the second tom on my drumset (pearl).   <br /> <br />Slipknot could do without theabsurd spacy effects, and put some real music in there.  Shoot, they could even do without HALF the band who play basically 3 of the same instruments each.  Along with getting rid of half the band they need to lose the masks.  They sound bad enough without trying to cover it up with makeup.   <br /> <br />So if your a fan of KsE, Lamb of God, Unearth, or Soilwork...don't bother with this cd.  It'll just make you want to give up on listening to radio ever again. <br /> <br />John
B000AY3KN0|5.0|The original King Kong would always be a 5 star movie and this newly restored edition is no exception.  What is special though are the documentaries on the second disc. <br /> <br />In particular, the main documentary is exceptional and lasts for nearly three hours. It is well worth the higher price of this set and would be worth the money in its own right.  This together with the actual movie makes this set one not to be missed.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay have been decidedly boring since the beginning.  I don't really have a problem with any of their music, when it comes on the radio i just sort of tune it out. Until a few days ago when the song 'Talk' came on the radio. At first I thought \\"oh, cool someone covered kraftwerk and it's actually getting played on the radio\\" but then the vocals started and I said aloud, \\"my god, no!\\" I'm still outraged that they had the audacity to blatantly rip off the melody from 'computer love'. This goes way beyond simple sampling. I have now lost what little respect i ever had for coldplay. Do yourself a favour and buy Kraftwerk's  'Computer World' instead. It's a much better album, and it's all original.
B00005JKJA|4.0|This is a real suspense film.  It is a good example of Alfred Hithcock the master of suspense version.  When Diane has the car accident at the beginning of the movie, she acts as a somnambulate person. Naomi Watts plays the role of Betty beautifully, and Laura Harring's performance as Rita's partner<br /><br />was convinced.  These two women involves in a dangerous romance with noting to left to the imagination as the sex scenes takes action.  Other scenes really horror us, these takes place in the office apartment when the murder shoots the old man and a fat woman was in a fierce battle with the murder and was shoot  too.  He shoots the retarded janitor, to make a triple murder.<br /><br />The drama was intense and must be viewed more than once.  This is really a suspense drama with an unexpected end.
B00005AQGH|5.0|i cant believe people are offended by the cover it defines all the songs in the form of a picture.(if u are smart)the picture shows pac trin to keep it together N.S.E.W and help his people. but instead we his own people cruxified him in other words killed him.jus like the jews killed Jesus.so all u idiots that pretend to be religious and say \\"i like pac but im offended.\\" u dont know s*it bout him. <br />over all its my fav pac album of all time <br />def 5/5
B000AYEIZY|5.0|First, I know that Amazon doesn't encourage too many personal comments but in this case I just have to offer some background. In 1966 and 1967 I had a power trio with Mike Wedgwood, later with Kiki Dee, Curved Air, Caravan and so on, and George Hart, who wrote much of the legendary \\"Death may be your Santa Claus\\" by Secondhand (see Amazon.co.uk). We loved the Beatles, the Kinks, the Who and the Stones as encapsulating harmony, melody, humour, whimsy, rhythmn and almost heart-stopping musical ability: and so we played tons of their songs. But we also loved Eric Clapton and the blues, and along came Cream. So we played the whole of \\"Fresh Cream\\" except for Toad - don't ask. I loved the band so much that I followed them around, and some of my souvenirs and memories are in Chris Welch's superb book \\"Cream\\", for review see Amazon.co.uk - and if you like/liked Cream, get Chris' beautifully produced book. So mad- keen was I that I hitch-hiked from Salisbury to London to see Cream at the Saville Theatre in London (now long-closed) on the chance of getting a ticket - I did, and the only surviving programme is in Chris' book. They were on with the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, believe it or not, and The Action.    Well, memory is a strange and deceptive mistress. I have a 19 year old son who s a demon sax player, and I am afraid that I have skewed his view of music by the \\"in my day...\\" nostalgia, although I don't regret introducing him to old school friend (yes, the same school!)Andy Sheppard on sax, because Andy is the best soprano player in the world: but I am aware that young kids can miss out on a lot of the good new stuff because \\"Dad thinks it's rubbish\\" - dangerous territory.    But then, out of the blue, along comes a chance to see if all those old memories are just rose-tinted or actually quite accurate, with the announcement that Cream were reforming for 4 gigs only. So, after virtually remortgaging the house, I bought two tickets for the Thursday night and off son and Iwent.    When the three old boys walked on stage, the ovation was deafening. There was Jack, fresh from a liver transplant, the type of which poor old Rory Gallagher did not survive: there was Ginger, riddled with arthritis and in his sixties: and there was Eric, after a life of hard times, addiction problems and mixed musical fortunes.    And off they went. My God, and off they went. Several things I had forgotten: they can all sing and the harmonies were exceptional: Ginger's drum sound is the most exciting thing you could ever hear: Jack has the voice of an angel with a range denied to all but a very few: and Eric can play anything.    I know that it sounds unbelievable to those who were not there, but they were just about note-perfect from start to finish - and now we have this fantastic DVD to prove it. On a personal note, the \\"Stormy Monday\\" and \\"Toad\\" were both recorded the night we were there and both are just brilliantly played - what's that about the band jamming, everybody? After Toad, my son said that this was the best ten minutes of his musical life, having seen Jeff Beck, Stevie Winwood, Meatloaf, Eric and Andy Sheppard in the same 12 months. Other high spots are \\"We're going wrong\\" \\"Sunshine\\" (of course) \\"Rollin and a tumblin\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" (although the Wheels of Fire version is definitive).    The whole DVD is a joy to watch and the playing is mind-bending. It's not just three old mates having a good time, it's three absolutely faultless musicians having a good time. For once, son and I could compare notes and agree that perhaps' Dad's memory was not too bad after all. If you have not bought this DVD you should: the Stormy Monday alone is worth the price of admission on its own.    A few weeks ago, my wife was waitressing at a shoot on the downs (hills) near us. Eric was there and signed two programmes - one from 1967 and one from 2005. Same line-up, same music, same magic. He also signed a mug for my daughter, \\"To Izzie, Eric 2005\\". What an incredibly talented, nice and gentle man.    Cream rule. No competition.
B00001IVOR|5.0|Only track I skip is Black Shampoo, other than that this album is dazzling and there is no filler. They took their time and came up with a classic, what all artists should do.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|the crow + blade + matrix = underworld..great action movie with vampires, werewolves and KATE!!
B0007KTBIU|1.0|Disney's fictionalized love story between the 12 year old Pocahontas and the 27 year old John Smith can only leave us praying that this didnt happen in real life. (Pocahantas married John Rolfe when she was 19 and had a child, which is, of course, left out of this movie).  <br />    Even if you get passed the blatant pedophilia overtones, the movie is still filled with bland musical numbers, and boring dialogue.
B0001IPBUK|5.0|Unless you have been hanging around Europe for a while now you may not recognize the name Anastacia, although she began in the US with the Phenominal hit I'm Outta Love she has sadly been shunned by American Airwaves. So packing it up she headed to Europe only to became a HUGE international star.<br /><br />This classic album showcases Anastacia's strong gritty voice full of raw emotion and power.<br /><br />Well its figuring out whats going on in the mind of a lover such as in the track Left Outside Alone An upbeat what the heck is wrong with you track.<br /><br />Living it up as a sexy single, a fun upbeat song which will get you up and movin.<br /><br />Or the heartbreaking Heavy on My Heart you realize the passion and the range of this artist. The imagery in this song is fantasic and the breathy vocals are haunting.<br /><br />Or by far the best song to hit the music industry, Maybe Today, if you need a heart breaker, this is the song for you!<br /><br />If Britney Spears is your idea of talent, this album won't interest you, if you are an Alanis or Jewel fan, pick this puppy up!

B0007P3582|1.0|Yawwwwwwwwwwwwwn. What's the difference between this guy, Ja Rule and Puffy? Well, this guy has been shot more times, that's about it. In terms of what you get when you press play, they are xerox copies of each other. Hey, let's go ahead and do a couple of tribute albums to this guy!! He deserves it just as much as eminem, which received his first tribute cd when he had been releasing cd's for about as long as this guy has, which is about 1 year. Once again, I did try to endure going through this stuff. I just couldn't. Did anybody notice this guy barely moves his jaw and lips when he raps? That's why he gets such a boring, monotonous, mumbling kind of undecipherable vibe. Reminds me of super musical genius Ja Rule. Remember mr.J had to lyp-sync on the Mtv VMA's as he is unable to reproduce rapping live, which is not anymore difficult than normal conversational speech!! Amazing. If these are the idols of today's youth, we are doomed. People who think this is music have no idea whatsoever about what music is. None at all. Zero. Nada. Actually, less than zero. But, ignorance is bliss. Hitting the \\"no\\" icon beneath this review because you are 50 fan and you THINK I am wrong is a stamp of approval - admitting that everything I have said are absolute truths. Go ahead, show us your ignorance. Those who vote in favor are rare glimmers of hope left in this world of musical ignorance. The facts speak for themselves, but only to those who have at least a basic level of musical knowledge. Now, excuse me. I have to get back to my Death Metal, Jazz, Blues, Funk, and Afro-Cuban CD's...REAL MUSIC.
B000065BPB|4.0|I had purchased these to replace an aging set of Koss HV/1A headphones which I have had since high school. I have found the Sennheiser to be an excellent replacement save for one thing- bass reproduction (thus 4 instead of 5 stars). I can hear subtlelties in music and DVD's that I have not noticed with my standard speakers (mirage omnisats with sub). The sound quality is superior to my old headphones for the high and midrange frequencies. Unfortumately, the HD-280's are a little lacking in the bass department. Not as ground shaking with low frequencies when watching movies. My old Koss headphones has more bass emphasis. This seems puzzling since I noticed other reviews did not mention the weakness with bass.    The one other drag which is inherent in most all over the ear headphone designs is they are a tad uncomfortable to wear with eyeglasses on.    Overall the HD 280's offer great sound and are worth the money.    Addendum:  I have since found the that when I get a good seal on the headphones (something that doesn't occur with my eyeglasses on) I get much better bass response so I am moving this from 4 to 5 stars. Kudos to Sennheiser. These are a bargain now that the price is even lower.
6305313687|5.0|The story of Derek and his brother Danny is a heart wrenching and intense story filled with prejudicial killing, intense racism, the culture behind gangs, and how a man's life can change...quite drastically.  <br /> <br />Edward Norton does a FANTASTIC job playing Derek and it is amazing to watch the transformation he goes through after he gets put in the big house. It is amazing to also see how the power of influence plays over people- especially when you consider such subjects like racism, drugs, alcohol, and etc.. Watch this- and urge others too also.  <br /> <br />The ending is shocking... and should cause you to think about how your actions will affect others not only presently- but also in the future.
B0000039QA|4.0|I got this and I'm sorry Biggie fans but Ready to Die drops a big stinking load on this CD. I skip most tracks on here because he went crazy with the club songs but his storytelling is above par.

B000002WPI|5.0|Not just rap, best group ever. 9 people (Excluding Cappadonna) that can construct great solo and group efforts and this is where it started. Still gritty nd grimey but Wu-Tang Forever is the better listen but this album is where you should start for the full Wu experience.
B00005JOIF|4.0|Steven Spielberg is no stranger to delicate political topics, and herein makes no exception with a fairly graphic, factually based chronology of the Black September aftermath at the 1972 Munich Olympics of the title, the five men chosen to eliminate the ones responsible, and the fallout and retribution on both sides, engendered thereafter.<br /><br />Eric Bana plays Avner, an expectant father and low key Mossad enlisted soldier, but son of a hero, who is as horrified and outraged at the events of Munich as the rest of his family and countrymen. He is called to undertake a special \\"task\\" outlined by prime minister Golda Meir and her cabinet, in the wake of the killings to \\"let the World know\\" the consequence of the Palestinians actions, by setting off to Europe with a list of assassination targets. I won't go into too much further detail, as I don't wish to spoil the movie. I actually have vague memories of the Israeli Hostage debacle at Munich myself, and went on to study the (then termed) Arab/Israeli Conflict in more detail several years later. As an impartial, it is perhaps easier to see through the passionate elements of the story, and draw conclusions on a wider, human level, and it is here that the power of the story lies. Regardless of your political, or religious affiliations, the story is much deeper than the apparent two sides on display, and yet becomes paradoxically more basic in its message (at least in my humble opinion as to the message Spielberg seems to be trying to get across). This is not about \\"highly trained\\" assassins paying dues, but rather, well intended, deeply motivated and passionate men following orders for what they think is right, and juggling with their own morality later. The question it seems is an age old one, \\"does the end justifying the means\\" and as the story deepens and unfolds, the main characters all begin to battle with moral demons, and paranoid soul searching. There is a wealth of talent on display here, Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds (HBO Rome's Caesar), Daniel Craig (the new 007 by the way) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Jakob the Liar) and several others, who glean the benefits of a tight script and masterful direction by Spielberg throughout. There are some terrific moments of high tension, some very graphic violence, and also unfortunately, some stale plodding periods along the way. I marveled at the attention to detail in re creating 1973, from the models of European cars, and clothing, to even correct movie posters outside theatres, appearing in no more than a walk across scene. On the down side, this movie is a tad on the long side at 2hrs and 44 mins, and could have arguably been shaved by about 20 minutes. Others have suggested that more could have been done with the material, although I thought it was well handled (with the exception of juxtaposing a sex scene with hostage murders). It is certainly well deserving of the `R' rating, and doesn't (in the usual Spielberg fashion) shy away from the grittiest of details, especially in the bombing and murder scenes. On the whole I rated it 4 Stars, which is probably a little generous, but the polished feel to the whole picture, and excellent acting all round is well worthy of merit. An Oscar contender? I doubt it, and it's hardly Stevens's best work to date, but it IS well worth seeing.

B00006DEFA|2.0|The original version was amazing. The hard work of Saliery against the genious given for free to Mozart. Saliery continues helping Mozart, though he is humiliated by him. Yes, naturally he is jealous but at the same time he is nobel. The hard work of Saliery doesn't pay him, he comes to revolt against the god. At the same time Mozart destroys his own life drinking and wasting money. He brings the disaster on himself. It was a very powerfull conflict between the two completely different apporaches: the work and the talent, the reward and the gift. <br /> <br />What about the new director cut? A few added scenes flattens the whole movie. Saliery becomes a jelous, evil mediocre seeking for pure revenge. He causes Mozart to loose all his pupils, he constantly tries to convince the emperor Mozart operas should not be performed. Saliery is the one who pushes Mozart to his death, he is responsible for the misery state of Mozart. There's no more conflict in the movie, there's a clear \\"bad guy\\" and \\"good guy\\" - finally a perfect Holywood film! So pity.

B0002X314C|4.0|I waited a while to get this disc because I thought it might be one of those with 2/3 really good songs and the rest would be filler tracks - OH HOW WRONG I WAS!!  This is an excellent debut cd from a musician who I hope is around for a long time to come. John's vocals are not perfect but the imperfect scratchy yet soulfulness of his voice reminds me strongly of Prince & Bill Withers.<br /><br />The tracks that stand out to me are: LIVE IT UP; ORDINARY PEOPLE; STAY WITH YOU; LET'S GET LIFTED; I CAN CHANGE; LET'S GET LIFTED AGAIN (song that reminds me most of Prince); SO HIGH & THE PRELUDE<br /><br />John Legend is indeed a welcome breath of fresh air to the r&b music scene and like others, most notably: Anthony Hamilton, Rasaahn Patterson, Eric Benet, Lyfe Jennings & Van Hunt, who maybe aren't getting the type of recognition as John are putting their own individual stamps on the landscape of music that has become tired, formulaic \\"hip pop\\".
6304806426|5.0|I put off seeing this movie for years because it was the brunt of so many jokes when it first came out, and I've never particularly liked Kristin Scott Thomas.  So I repeatedly skipped it on cable until there was nothing else on one night and I just happened to start watching.  There was an instant connection. It's a beautiful movie and I've since bought the DVD and soundtrack. I have a whole new appreciation of Ralph Finnes and Juliet Binoche, and I have since bought several DVDs of their movies. I almost missed one of the best movies I've ever seen because I pre-judged it based on other peoples opinions.  While feedback from others is helpful, you need to make up your own mind based on your own response to the movie.
B00064VR0W|5.0|I bought this dvd on a lark... It is worth it.  Great production, lavish sets... Rod is the only one in blue jeans. <br /> <br />He looks starved.  The babes are great.   <br /> <br />Get this at lowest price and enjoy. It is worth a watch.
0743482832|5.0|Of all the literary dreams of Shakespeare this one seems the most calming. Its begins with the tempest but comes to a most happy ending. Its action is in a day, and it is the one Shakespeare play that makes a pretence of observing the 'unities'. It has an enchanted atmosphere, and the words of Miranda are in a way its motto,<br /><br />\\"O, wonder!<br /><br />How many goodly creatures are there here!<br /><br />How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world<br /><br />That has such people in't! (V.i.181-4)<br /><br />But to arrive at its reconciliations it must show first the disturbances of lust, and wrongminded ambition for kingship. There is much in play about the metaphor of playing itself. \\"The world is a stage\\" make its acts of reconciliation a kind of magical act.<br /><br />A world of wonder is the dream of the king of all playwrights, close to his closing the factory down. The play was written in 1611  and is one of Shakespeare's last, and most memorable.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Why is it that the older these great groups get the slower they like to play?  I will tell you why.   I am 55 and I know how they could feel.  Perhaps they savor the wine more and are more CONFIDENT than they were when they first went to the Royal Albert and performed.  Either way, I think this is a DVD worth having.  I was disappointed how slow they play most everything.  The beat on the first Albert Hall appearance was unbelivably fast.  On this they show there age (or wisdom). <br /> <br />Either way,  a big thumbs up and give this group a handicap for being a bit tired of performing (after all, they earned it).
B000BJS4SU|4.0|coming from a guitarist here.. his chops stand with the best of the blues guys today and MUCH better than the Kenny Waynes types out there.  People.. he is singing AND delivering outstanding guitar playing, at the same time.  Do you have any idea how difficult that is to do?  We're talking SRV and Hendrix stuff here. His sound sorta reminds me of Doyle Bramhall II, who could never really break into the mainstream.  That's Mayers deal, bringing blues fused rock-n-roll to all those kids that have had a steady IV-drip of over produced pop and hip-hop... give us more John!! <br /> <br />Doesn't get 5-stars because of the poor audio quality.
6304044836|5.0|I rate \\"Sabrina\\" (1995) 5-stars because the cast is geat and do a fine job of acting.<br /><br />\\"Sabrina\\" is about a young woman, who falls in love with her father's employer's youngest son played by Greg Kinnear.<br /><br />The basic premise is a Cinderella-type story.<br /><br />The movie is geat and the ending is ironic.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes a romantic comedy.<br /><br />*(Recommended for ages 18+ due to mature adult themes).
068987474X|4.0|I saw this book on the shelf at my local library, picked it up, started thumbing through it, then sat down and read pretty much the whole thing, right there at the library.  I ended up checking it out and bringing it home, so that I could read passages to a very dear friend who was going through a breakup.  In the past, I had found myself making excuses for the guy, pretty much like the women in this book.  After reading this, I think I finally understood that no one who really cared about my friend would treat her like he did.  In the end, though it is harsh, this book is empowering.  For my friend, it was better to say \\"he's not that into me\\" and move on, versus going around and around about what she might have said, or done, etc.   <br />I think that some of the examples in this book were a bit extreme, but of course they were there to illustrate or prove a point.  A quick read, but one whose message has stuck with me.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|: The rise and fall (and rise again) of Yuri Orlov arms dealer is the focus of Andrew Niccol's acidic (writer of \\"The Truman Show\\" and writer-director of \\"SimOne\\", \\"Gattaca\\") unfocused blend of satire and action in \\"Lord of War\\".  Yuri has no hidden agenda beyond making money unlike his rival Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) who lives to influence the way the wind of power blows. Oh and Yuri's also got an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) on his trail as well. Things aren't going so well right now for Yuri even though he's raking in record profits. Recalling Stanley Kubrick's black humor classic Nicholas Cage portrays Yuri as the ultimate salesman-he could be selling pharmaceuticals or a car but he's decided to be \\"the merchant of death\\".  \\"Lord of War\\" is a deft mix of action, drama and satire. With actors Jared Leto as Yuri's confused drug dependent younger brother and Bridget Moynahan as his seemingly oblivious wife the film lights up the screen combining brilliant visual motifs with top notch acting, writing and direction. The opening sequence where we follow a bullet from \\"birth\\" to \\"death\\" is a riveting powerful sequence.<br /><br />A very nice sharp transfer for \\"Lord of War\\" the film looks quite good with rich colors and an active 6.1 mix DTS audio mix, a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Ex mix and an audio commentary by writer/director Andrew Niccol on a 2.0 mix. The audio comes across crystal clear.<br /><br /> First two criticisms about the product itself not the quality of the film or special features. 1) I hate the packaging of this two disc edition. It looks cheap and sucks big time.  Once you slide out the two disc set from the cardboard sleeve you'll find the two discs housed in a cheap cardboard case with a disc holder glued in the middle. It looks very tacky. The single disc edition at least appears to come in an Amray hardcase. 2) The single disc edition has no extras, zero. This recalls the time when movies were released on DVD a decade ago with just the feature film. This nasty trend didn't start with but was most noticeable with Steven Spielberg's \\"War of the Worlds\\". All major studios stop doing this it confuses consumers (some people who want the editions with extras can't find them or, worse yet, buy the single disc sets and then get upset. It's ticking off the customer. Lion's Gate this is an idiotic move. Don't do it again. If you're going to put out a two disc edition do it right-put in a two disc Amray case WITH a booklet vs. these cheapo looking cardboard containers. Steven Spielberg should have been ashamed and Lion's Gate you should be too.<br /><br />The first disc has two special features. The first is an intelligent and informative commentary track by writer/director Andrew Niccol. Niccol's an intelligent and passionate writer/director. Most of the monologue focuses on production details but there is a good amount of other things discussed as well that Niccol learned during the research for his film. Although Niccol's commentary is intermittent and quiet it's intelligent and focused. The second extra on the first disc is an Easter egg if you click on the Amnesty International logo. Nicholas Cage appears in a plea to prevent the continue sales of arms. He discusses the impact that it has in terms of human life.<br /><br />The second disc of this DVD features most of the special features. The most important one is the documentary \\"\\"Making a Killing\\"\\" which takes a look at the true cost of selling arms. These people that do it look at themselves as businessmen but they are, in reality, nothing more than leeches living off of the suffering of humanity. Featuring interviews with William Schultz of Amnesty International and Philip Coyle a Senior Advisor with the World Security Institute. As Coyle points out the U.S. is one of the largest arms sellers and we end up going to war against many of the countries that end up eventually buying many of these killing machines. Dr Sylvester Rowe Executive Director of the UnitedStates also appears as narrating documentary footage shot in many of these Third World countries where tin dictators pay for arms to stay in control while their populations starve. It's an informative excellent featurette. We also find out the fate of children in these countries who end up becoming young soldiers and victims of their society. \\"Weapons of the Trade\\" features a gallery of the various weapons seen in the film, a text history of the weapon and the specs. \\"The Making of `Lord of  War'\\" is a marvelous behind-the-scenes featurette. We hear comments from director Niccol about what inspired him to make this acidic satire and what attracted the various actors to the project. There's also a photo gallery, trailers for the film and seven deleted scenes that round out the special features on the second disc.<br /><br />Although it's an imperfect film, \\"Lord of War\\" is still a deft entertaining and acidic satire on the obsession our world has with weapons of destruction. Cage gives a brilliant performance as Yuri the arms dealer and has able support from Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan  and Eamonn Walker as a psychotic despot leader. It's well worth watching although, depending on your political beliefs, you'll be either outraged at Niccol's liberal point of view or delighted to find someone who agrees with you.nited States also appears as narrating documentary footage shot in many of these Third World countries where tin dictators pay for arms to stay in control while their populations starve.

0307276902|5.0|Like many people, I was upset when I found out that some of what James had written was indeed not true. However, this book is phenomenal. It's fast-paced, in-depth and truely inspiring. It gives you hope that people can do better, be better, and become better. I have never been hooked to drugs, but I was a drinker in college and have been depressed most of my life. It's message was clear to me: Don't ever give up. Keep that inner voice inside you strong and don't let anger get the best of you. I would, and am, recommending this book to everyone I know. Although your head is tired after some time, you cannot stop reading it. I literally have had to fall asleep before I put it down.
0060005696|5.0|From the beginning, this book gives you an entirely different look at what the abundant choice we take for granted really offers us in life.  Ever wondered to yourself why life seems more stressful than 20 years ago?  Ever been overwhelmed when try to pick the best of many choices?  This book answers those questions and more.  The final chapter offers ideas to improve and they are excellent suggestions.  Highly recommended
0740748475|5.0|My wife and I bought this as a gift for our 8-yr daughter.  I think she's read every page in this three-volume tome at least twice.  She loves Calvin and his somtimes goulish imagination. <br /> <br />Best of all we like to read these strips together.
0385483821|5.0|This a good book based on facts. Andrew Grove goes on describing how Intel managed to shift from a semiconductor to the microprocessor company while he was the CEO... (now it is shifting again under Paul Otellini).<br /><br />Although the example a bit outdated since it was written in 1996, the same principles still apply. A must read if you want to understand why some great and big companies suddenly go down while others emerge quickly.<br /><br />You always need to learn the history to understand the future.
B0006399FS|4.0|This is U2's 3rd best album, right behind Achtung Baby & The Joshua Tree. <br /> <br />Gone are the electro experiments of the 90's, hello direct songwriting, U2 playing off their ultimate strengths. <br /> <br />Vertigo is the white hot lead single. 3 minutes of pure energy and rock and roll bliss. A band of 45 year olds recorded this? Yes, they did. It recalls Boy in it's energy, and the lyric contemplates a post 9/11 paranoia.  <br /> <br />Miracle Drug is U2 in the classic mold. The amazing story of Christopher Nolan told through music (though it probably relates as much to Africa). Uplifting, passionate, and powerful. Edge on fire. <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. From father to son. A bluesy ballad of love from son to father. Again, U2 using their fundamentals to craft and emotional and powerful tribute. It's as real as songs get. Feel it. <br /> <br />Love And Peace Or Else. Whoah. This song is the kicker. A sonic masterpiece. U2 channel T.Rex in the main riff as they play 70's glam rock full tilt. A mantra for peace and harmony, with a giant fist. Look for Edge to play one of the most dark guitar solos in the history of rock. <br /> <br />City Of Blinding Lights. Hello NYC. This is for you. U2 played NYC right after 9/11. And this is what they saw. \\"All You Look So Beautiful Tonight.\\" Soaring, epic U2 with a classic gutar line and driving rhythm. This is pure U2. This is their sound, their identity. And they are completely at home in it.  <br /> <br />All Because Of You. U2 in full floorboard shaking mode. It starts in 5th gear, and never drops. Larry lays down that Charlie Watts beat and Edge and Adam just drive like mothers. It's Visceral. Bono's double track vocal and the beat give the song a real 60's flavor, and I get 2 solos from Edge. The ambiguous lyric (God? Ali? Us?) makes it all the more enjoyable. <br /> <br />A Man And A Woman. The groove tune.  The bass line is brilliant. It'll stretch your speakers. <br /> <br />Crumbs From Your Table. Nice intro, especially the 12 string acoustic. If you listen close, you can hear the click track. Then BAM! Edge seems to own this tune, riffing left and right, dirty and atmospheric, but it's Adam & Larry who provided the push and pull that move the tune. Bono's double track vocal really cuts through all the guitars while providing an ominous feel, and his lyrics are the most biting and venomous of his career. And they top it all off by jamming out the ending, firing on all cylinders. <br /> <br />One Step Closer. Atmospheric. Delicate. A hymm. The perfect song for 3 am. <br /> <br />Original Of The Species. U2 putting all their songwriting talents to good use. Starts as a simple piano led ballad, and it quickly explodes into a beautiful pop tune. Edge plays Beatlesque fills, as strings fill the air. Bono tells a tale on innosence enjoyed as the band just lift higher and higher. One of the top 10 U2 songs ever.  <br /> <br />Yahweh. A prayer. Simple and graceful.  <br /> <br />In a world full of cock-rock, empty pop, and Kid A wanna-bes, it's nice to hear the worlds best rock band settle into their own shoes and just play. Songs. That's all it's ever been about. Get this album. And play it LOUD.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I feel that this movie needs to be viewed by all individuals who have a pre-conception of what a gay male or gay life is all about.  It completely, without question, casts a new light on any current understandings of the lifestyle based on stereotypical nonsense. <br />Bible thumpers and those \\"Christians\\" need not to be protesting this movie since, it is more factual than they would ever imagine in their wildest dreams.  They need not be afraid of the truth or hide their heads in the sand or hide behind their bibles. <br />Such \\"Christians\\" need to practice what they preach and open their minds and hearts to all human beings regardiess of their sexuality.  If they view this movie with an open mind, they may have a much better understanding of what \\"love\\" really is, and begin to open their hearts as a \\"good Christian\\" should, based upon their own preachings rather than promoting hatred.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This movie had all the ingredient of a great film but one. It is the script.  I mean the acting was perfect. Keira gave a brilliant performance as Elizabeth, and Matthew grew on me as Darcy. But the script readers the script!!.... <br />It really suck..  <br />The writers too much  poetic license when they try to modernize the story.   In doing so they alienated the core fan of P&P. I liked the 1995 version but always thought some of the character were miscast and too old to play the part(ie Jenifer Erhle as Elizabeth, Wickham, Caroline Bingley, The Gardiners). This time around I like the cast and hate the story line.  I only pray that the next attempt will be the correct one. <br />I still recommend the purchase of that movie. In fact I have pre-odered it myself.  If one can get over the imperfection of the story  and its failed attempt at modernization ( Elizabeth not wearing gloves at the Netherfield ball, the new version of Georgiana dealing with Wickham, Elizabeth getting even with Darcy at the Meryton assembly, The Rosing proposal...), you will find it quite a delightful tale.   <br />In a world where movies seemed to be laced with violence, questionable take on morality, this  movie is one of best family friendly film made.  So support this film by buying  the DVD <br />
B00005N83M|1.0|This LP receives only 1 star.<br /><br />\\"Play\\" is the only worthy track on this LP.  Otherwise,  it's just garbage.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This is one of the few examples of the DVD extras of a movie being neither completely superfluous & annoying nor destroying the enjoyability of the movie it is supposedly enhancing. While the movie easily stands on its own terms without any \\"Collateral 101\\" preparation, bearing a witness to the genius of \\"Michael Mann University\\" as Jamie Foxx beautifully put it, made for a quantum leap in my appreciation of this film.<br /><br />About ten years ago, when HEAT came to the theatres, my first reaction was that any director who could entice Al Pacino and Robert de Niro to not just be in the same movie but play antagonists to each other had to be, as Russell Crowe continually refers to him, \\"a force of nature\\"; above and beyond the brilliance of directing/producing an 80's TV detective show that changed how everyone in New York dressed (let alone Miami), even in the wintertime. Not only was my intuition on point, since seeing it in the theatres I have seen HEAT at least 25 times--without exaggeration--and am continuously amazed at how impossible it is to get sick of it.<br /><br />COLLATERAL is just like it. A cab driver, in denial over the lack of ownership he's taken over his own life and dreams, has two passengers in one night: a beautiful young state prosecutor who begins to like him as much as he likes her (Jada Pinkett Smith)...and a somewhat arrogant businessman type (Tom Cruise) whose real estate ventures and overnight visits to friends turns out to be the murderous agenda of a sociopath assassin for hire. How all three of these lives rise and converge on the streets of Los Angeles is done with such impeccable artistry and refinement that every scene takes on a level of believability; every scene shows another step in the transformation--or deconstruction--of every character.<br /><br />Foxx is brilliant. His character's journey is so measured and so real that you cannot help but undergo it with him at key points. Tom Cruise, who is as underrated as often as he is overrated as an actor (while his work in THE LAST SAMAURAI disappointed me, I still have not forgiven the Academy for dissing him in MAGNOLIA), gives what can easily be called his Denzel/TRAINING DAY/\\"finally, someone gives me a bad guy\\" career performance. The nihilism of his character, constantly proclaimed as he feels himself succumbing to the crisis of conscience making his sanity ever more fragile, is overshadowed by his ruthlessness...and yet not.<br /><br />I would have gone with the title VINCENT & MAX, playing on the expectations of it being a buddy movie.  It is one (strangely), and yet paradoxically is also anything but. But that just once again reveals the genius of the real star of this picture: director Michael Mann. So many innocent people are either killed or have their lives changed forever by the events of this one night that Los Angeles does become a covert war zone. And before the movie ends, it becomes obvious that the only way all three characters in the most fascinatingly disturbing \\"love\\" triangle I have seen in quite some time can survive, is if they treat the innocent and not so innocent bystanders who drop like flies as what the title of the movie implies.  Mann, like a vampire watching his freshly bit victim becoming a vampire itself, turns Los Angeles into a mini Baghdad after sunset and before sunrise; making the characters--and us, the witnesses--both victims and accomplices of it all.<br /><br />Again, instead of being distracted by the DVD additions that open you to the world and aesthetic of Michael Mann, you will probably find yourself gaining an even greater appreciation for his work in general and this movie in particular.<br /><br />I give it four stars and not five because of the way it ended. The final scenes momentarily reminded me that I was watching a well-crafted movie and not helplessly experiencing a live event.  Mann and the screenwriter gave in to the temptation of controlling the drama of the story through craftsmanship, and not setting it free to uncontrollably disturb and write its own ending, via being as unpredictable and unstructured as life really is. In other words, in the last five minutes, just as he was about to complete a giant, in-your-face Jackson Pollock, it seemed like he got scared for some reason and made a Tiffany lamp.  That is where HEAT, for me, outshines this work. But the movie is sweet nonetheless. You will not be disappointed.ly disturb and write its own ending, via being as unpredictable and unstructured as life really is.

A cd with rap/hip hop influences, gospel, and rock influences..? how cool is *that*?   <br />The songs are mildly melancholy, but no one wants sometimes-sicking happiness all the time anyway. <br />

B00004W4UB|3.0|As far as filmmaking goes, this production only deserves 2 stars. However, because its classic Jekyll & Hyde source material (with its dark Freudian roots that reach into the subject of substance abuse) and the gloomy Jack-the-Ripper-in-London time period are so universally compelling, the movie is somewhat engrossing without really being effective. <br /> <br />I haven't read the novel on which MARY REILLY is based, but you can see the framework is there for a striking work. As the heroine is a lowly servant in the mysterious Dr. Jekyll's home, there's an element of spying involved that heightens the tension, and the role of women in Victorian times is a rich dramatic subject in itself. (Mary has few options in life and is forever treading on thin ice. When she risks listening outside her employer's door, it's a very different situation than if you or I were doing the same today.) There are no significant female characters in Stevenson's original novella, almost as if they weren't worth writing about, and telling the story from a female viewpoint opens the door for new layers of perspective. <br /> <br />A huge problem is that Stephen Frears fails to sustain an atmosphere that's either realistically grisly or theatrically horrifying. For one thing, although the occasional fog bank is rolled out, the lighting seems all wrong. When Mary hears noises in the night and creeps downstairs to investigate, the stairwell is lit with warm, honeyish light as if this were a sunny morning. (I don't know if this lighting is intended to flatter the actress playing Mary or not, but its as false and distracting as the clear polish that glimmers on her nails from time to time.) This sort of choice may seem minor, yet it completely undermines any air of menace. This same insensitivity to mood arises in the costuming, which is correct in its detailing but also brand-spanking-new. (When the impoverished Mary runs a scary errand, she wears a neat, sweeping tweed coat that would be perfectly at home in a Brooks Brothers or Burbury shop window today.) <br /> <br />These details aside, what truly derails the film is the fact that its stars don't share any chemistry. Julia Roberts is a natural sensualist while John Malkovich is coolly cerebral, and at least here, the opposites don't attract. It's also frustrating that, for some intellectual reason that may have appealed to Mr. Malkovich more than anyone else, Jekyll and Hyde aren't made to look very different. (Hyde basically looks like Jekyll with a hangover, and in need of a haircut.) This central conceit is completely jarring, and pretty much renders the drama ridiculous. <br /> <br />MARY REILLY was originally to be produced with Tim Burton (who ultimately chose to do ED WOOD instead) directing Winona Ryder. In this case, the idea of what might have been is far more exciting than what we finally get. <br />

B000BNX3AU|5.0|I happened to glance at a few reviews posted here and I must say I'm shocked that they are so ascerbic. What did you expect from a romantic comedy Dr. Zhivago! (If you see the movie you will apreciate my comment). I'll make it simple for you if you now find yourself at this review and are trying to decide if you should buy or rent this movie. Well I suggest you buy it because as they say once in not enough. Diane Lane will positively blow you away with her charm, grace, style, warmth, and ability to deliver quick staccato peppery dialogue. She is wonderfully appealing and is easily one of the best actresses out there today. Yes cudos go to those around her but it's the divine Miss Lane who runs away with this one. She has that ability to reach out through the screen and pull you into her life. Calling it acting would be an injustice to her craft. She makes her character a living, breathing, touching life that makes you want to hug her and hold her close and say......I'm sorry that husband of yours ever caused you to cry. You deserve better....you deserve love.....you deserve happiness....hell.....you even deserve a Golden Globe! Run.....don't walk.....and get it today. It's a keeper!

B00005JOFO|4.0|\\"I haven't seen 'Brokeback Mountain,' nor do I have any intention of seeing it,\\" joked Larry David in a recent New York Times. He facetiously blamed homosexual panic -- adding, by way of explanation, that as \\"a very susceptible person, easily influenced ... if two cowboys, male icons who are 100 percent all-man, can succumb, what chance do I have, half- to a quarter of a man?\\" <br /> <br />He shouldn't worry, and neither should anyone else. Ang Lee's sweeping, picturesque drama might increase tourism in Wyoming, but the problem faced by the main characters doesn't seem at all an enviable predicament.  <br /> <br />They are Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), two young cowhands who herd sheep together during the summer of 1963 and find themselves growing close in a way they vaguely understand but can't completely accept. <br /> <br />The two enter into a sudden affair that is frankly sketched but not particularly graphic or prolonged, and as its story unfolds, \\"Brokeback\\" really becomes more about the time the men are apart than the time they're together. They go their separate ways and try to start families, but are shadowed for years by their guilt, secrets, lies and love.  <br /> <br />The movie is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx but it was adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and, with its windswept small towns and its confused tough guys, it certainly feels of a piece with such classic McMurtry adaptations as \\"Hud\\" and \\"The Last Picture Show.\\" <br /> <br />Ledger, an Australian actor, seamlessly fits into the role of Ennis and gives one of the year's best performances. Early on, he seems to begin each sentence with the anxiety of a man stepping onto a high ledge, and when he does speak he mumbles through a mouth distorted by a chaw of tobacco. By the end, though, he's quietly become a surprisingly deep and tragic figure. <br /> <br />Gyllenhaal, as the more expressive of the pair, has the flashier part but is effective as well; and Michelle Williams, in a supporting role as Ennis' long-suffering wife, reveals a heartbreak that's no less real than that of the main characters.  <br /> <br />Buzz has been surrounding \\"Brokeback\\" since before it was released, and the praise is well deserved, but viewers might want to dial down the expectations fueled by the movie's uniformly rave reviews. Yes, this is one of the year's best, and it mines genuine sadness from situations that might've easily turned unintentionally funny -- let's face it, there's comic potential in the idea of gay cowboys, and Leno and Letterman have probably hit it all.  <br /> <br />But this is also a movie that hits its true highs with small, precise, understated ingredients such as the sight of a new number on a mailbox, or a forgotten childhood toy, or a scribbled message on a postcard, or an old shirt hanging in a closet.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Leftoverture (1976), Kansas's fourth album, is (as the sticker which comes with the remastered version says) \\"An all-time great classic rock album.\\"  No truer words have been recorded.  This album, while I personally consider Point Of Know Return (1977) to be superior, marks a turning point in the band's career.  Basically, after the minor reception of the band's first three albums, reality poured in: Produce an album of universal appeal or the jig's up.  I strongly suspect the poor recording quality of the album is a direct result of this ultimatum; the band obviously couldn't afford to record the album in a top-of-the-line studio.    Despite the recording quality, this album is a real standout in the scope of classic/progressive rock.  If I had to compile a list of twenty-five albums which I would force every person in the world to sit down and listen to (yes, most assuredly the adolescent crowd as well), this one would without a doubt be in the top ten.  Keep in mind that I, at the time of writing this, am an adolescent myself.        Without further ado, here's the track-by-track analysis:    1.  \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" (album version) - What could I possibly say about this song?  It's the product of about ten minutes worth of fiddling (no pun intended, especially because Steinhardt's signature instrument is absent from this track).  It's a classic rock treasure, and in my younger (therefore stupider) days, it was the reason I bought this album.  It suffers from a disease called OVERPLAY.  It's EVERYWHERE.  If you love listening to it when it comes on the radio, just put on any random movie (like Happy Gilmore) and you'll probably hear it there, too.  Just as a side note, the remaster seems to have placed the sound stage farther forward, because whenever this song comes on the radio there is a huge amount of reverberation which is utterly absent from this release of the album.    2.  \\"The Wall\\" - By-and-large, one of the greatest songs on this album.  The lyricsare deep and engaging, the vocals are impeccable, and the instrumentation is that special blend which makes Kansas unique.  The instrumental ending, which I at first though sounded like Rugrats music, is really nice.  This is definitely a great song.    3.  \\"What's On My Mind\\" - Here's a straight-up rocker which (reportedly) experienced a fair amount of airplay.  Why it has utterly disappeared from classic rock stations is beyond me (why, for instance, do these stations continue to play \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" as though it were the only song on the album?).  It's nice, bombastic, totally uninspired (in the progressive sense), undiluted rock.  In other words, it's absolutely wonderful.  The word \\"filler\\" isn't in Kansas's vocabulary; every song on this album is there for a reason (which, as we'll discuss later, scares me a little when you consider \\"Magnum Opus\\").    4.  \\"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\\" - This is one of my three favorite songs from this album.  The immediate draw of this piece is the continually shifting time signature--it's really intriguing and satisfying, in a strange sort of way.  It's the kind of thing which can change your entire perspective concerning the endless monotony of music which follows all the rules.  It inspired me; I can honestly say that my entire keyboarding style has been drastically affected by this one song.  This may well be my favorite song on the entire album.    The organ entrance is hypnotic, and as the drums (including some dramatic tympani) and Robbie Steinhardt's ubiquetous violin enter, the piece gains drive and purpose.  The melody is extremely catchy, the vocals are performed with virtuosic skill, and the proclaimation \\"I sang this song a hundred, maybe a thousand years ago; no one ever listens.  I just play and then I go\\" is more powerful and meaningful than any other moment on the album.  The piece ends on a dramatic tympani roll and with the crash of a gong.  Wow.  This is Kansas at its finest.    5.  \\"Opus Insert\\" - The last song is a tough act to follow, but I think \\"Opus Insert\\" is a valid attempt.  I really like this song.  The beginning is unassuming and misleading; the tune is more in the vein of \\"What's On My Mind,\\" although elements of \\"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\\" make themselves heard as well.  Personally, this music just makes me want to get up and move; the harmonies are lush and inspiring.  The only thing I really hate is that, right in the middle of the piece, there's a section which sounds like a carousel organ song.  Kansas has done much better instrumental breaks; if they had done so in this song it would certainly be, hands down, the greatest of the mainstream-oriented Kansas songs.  As such, it still gets five stars.  Awesome.    6.  \\"Questions Of My Childhood\\" - Ironically this song's title has a specal significance for me when coupled with the ARP synthesizer line which is used basically as an obbligato throughout the song.  Because of some unsavory events in my past which occured while ELP's \\"Lucky Man\\" was playing on the radio, any synth solo whose major component is the square wave has awoken within me undercurrents of discomfort and unease.  \\"Questions Of My Childhood\\" is the song which broke that for me, as its title urged me to question the utter absurdity of my childhood-derived aversion to those square waves.    It's not at all a bad song.  It probably doesn't even rank among the top twenty-five Kansas songs, but it's still nice.  The piano is very pretty, as is the fiddling.  And that ARP-generated square wave is unmistakable (and relentless).    7.  \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" - I'm more than a little tired of these songs that whine endlessly about how man--particularly American man--is all that is wrong with this planet.  Kansas has produced (at least) three such songs, and the only one I can stand is \\"Song For America\\" (Song For America, 1975), and only then because the latter has an irreplacable melodic intrigue.  Needless to say, I am not qualified to comment upon \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" other than that which I have already said.    8.  \\"Magnum Opus\\" - Remember back a few descriptions where I said we would get to this one?  Well, here it is.  I'm sorry; I have tried on FIVE separate occasions to like this song.  I just can't do it.  I know that this song has a great following among those who have reviewed this album.  I don't at all mean to impugne the collective preference of those who think highly of \\"Magnum Opus\\" (and that goes for the previous song as well).  In fact, I commend you folks for having minds which are obviously far more open than mine.    The first 2:30 are actually quite nice, but it goes downhill for me from there, and by the time we get to the beavers, we've reached full-tilt lunacy.  I'm sorry; I have heard some of the epic Kansas songs from the past albums (\\"The Pinnacle\\" from Masque, 1975, is one of my favorite songs of all time), and in my opinion \\"Magnum Opus\\" could not hold a candle to any of these.  As I have said, this is my own opinion (and I acknowledge and proport the validity of any dissenting opinion on the matter).    And now the extras:    9.  \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" (live) - This is just a live performance of the classic hit.  There is nothing exciting about this performance; to be truthful, I have never heard Two For The Show so when I say that I have yet to be impressed by a live performance by Kansas, there is always that bias present.    10. \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" (live) - See above for \\"Cheyenne Anthem.\\"  Even so, the recording effect Glixman talked about in the album notes is very nice.  It's just a shame you have to listen to \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" to experience it.        The remastering job is hard to describe in qualitative terms.  Seeing as I have never heard the album in any other incarnation, I have nothing to compare it to except for Point Of Know Return, which has an obvious remastering flaw (see my review of the latter fine album for details).  As I said above, the intrinsic recording quality of the entire Leftoverture album sounds pretty bad.  I imagine the remastered version is head-and-shoulders above any previous releases, but I often wonder what the album would have sounded like if it had been recorded decently.  The album notes mention new recording techniques.  Whenever the album notes start talking about the recording techniques, you know that either the album or the recording quality sucks.  And we have established that the album is exceptional...    Some of the tracks could use some extra bass, while other ones are quite fine unspoiled.  The treble is awful, but I have a sneaky suspicion this is just part of the original mastering tapes.  That's a real bummer, but what can one do?        Overall, this is a worthwile album.  Everyone and her ugly cousin has heard the first track, but the next five are what make this album an essential part of any self-respecting classic rock fan's music collection.  My only real complaint is the album art; the colors are awful when compared to the original.  I would recommend Leftoverture to just about anyone (yes, even those in the teenage generation--it might do them some good to hear some real music for a change).  More likely than not, you will not be disappointed.
B0007TFAXG|5.0|LACUNA COIL (Empty Spiral)<br /><br />Remember that name! If I'm right,(and I think I am) you are going to be seeing it and hearing them a lot in the future.<br /><br />I know, you're dubious. Lacuna Coil? What's a Lacuna Coil, never heard of them. Well if You've read any of my other reviews then you may remember that I mentioned Lacuna Coil in six of my reviews and categorically stated (actually predicted) that Lacuna Coil had an inside track to be the first European (they're Italian) Femme Fronted Goth Metal band to crash the American vinyl curtain in two of my reviews.<br /><br />When I first predicted that Lacuna Coil would make it big here stateside, the odds makers in Vegas were giving Fifty to One odds that I was all wet and I wagered two root beers(I grew up in Vegas and I never bet money) on this sure shot/long shot. Now that Lacuna Coil is touring the East coast with the likes of Type 'O' Negative and Anthrax and their single \\"Heavens a Lie\\" is starting to get airtime, look out. The odds have dropped to Ten to One and I like my position.<br /><br />Why do I think Lacuna Coil has such a good chance to make the charts here? For starters let me quote my 42 word prediction from the my semi-infamous Evanescence review from June 21st, \\"I think Italian prog/gothic metal band Lacuna Coil has the best chance of making a breakthrough since they will be touring the country this summer and fall and their hit single \\"Heaven's a Lie\\" is now getting air time on some radio stations.\\" Next I'd like to quote my Lacuna Coil review on In a Reverie, \\"It seems to me that of all the wonderful goth-metal bands of Europe, Lacuna Coil has the best chance of making an impact in America. They have many songs that would not be out of place on an alternative, heavy metal or even top 40 radio format and they have a small but growing following in the states. This summer they are touring the states as the opening act for Danzig. It seems that Lacuna Coil is bigger than Danzig but I guess not in the states.\\" Enough braggado, the reason I feel so confident in Lacuna Coil's American future is that they and all of their albums are just so damn good (I know a lot of epinionators would say fu*king here but damn works for me), that it's, well, INEVITABLE!!!<br /><br />LACUNA COIL<br /><br />Lacuna Coil has made a S/T debut EP and three full albums, chronologically, In a Reverie, Unleased Memories and Comalies and to be perfectly honest I can't say one is better than the other. They are the most consistent group I've ever come across.<br /><br />Band Members<br /><br />Cristia Scabbia (female vocals), Andrea Ferro (male vocals), Cristiano Migliore (guitars), Marco Coti Zelati (bass) and Cristiano Mozzati (drums), Marco Biazzi (guitars)<br /><br />Lacuna Coil is somewhat of a non conformist for an Italian band. Most other Italian bands, like Rhapsody, concentrated on epic power metal, Lacuna Coil devoted themselves to progressive, melodic, gothic style. Lovely singer Cristina Scabbia and singer Andrea Ferro share the mic and do a very good job at it. They compliment each other perfectly and give each song a special emphasis. Cristina's voice, while not quite on a par with other European divas such as Floor Jensen, is quite pleasant to listen to. It is deeper than most and a quality that fits Lacuna Coil's music(which is somewhat progressive)perfectly. Needless to say Lacuna Coil probably would not be where they are today without Christina.<br /><br />I should point out that Lacuna Coil's brand of metal is not speed or even fast. Their tempo is generally in the medium/slow to medium range, which gives it time for slow minded individuals, like me, to absorb, sort of like Creed and like Creed, the music and delivery is powerful.<br /><br />\\"Heaven's a Lie\\", begins with a lush symphonic introduction, before Christina's sultry vocals along with a strong beat and Andrea's backing on the chorus's.<br /><br />Other notable songs, in their order of appearance follows;<br /><br />\\"Swamped\\", is an exotic medium slow song with a definite near eastern flavor, with passionate vocals by Andrea and soaring ethereal vocals by Christina.<br /><br />\\"Daylight Dancer\\", is a medium tempo piece where Andrea takes the lead vocals and Christina in a ethereal mood does backup<br /><br />\\"Humane\\", my vote for second best song, is a Quasi-ballad with Andrea and Christina swapping lead and backing vocals.<br /><br />\\"Tightrope\\", a mid tempo song with a slight mid east feeling. For some reason this song reminds me of that fabulous Polish femme-goth metal group Artrosis but sans Andrea.<br /><br />\\"The Ghost Woman and the Hunter\\", has my vote for most interesting title. Another very pretty quasi-ballad with all the trimmings. Of course, Christina could make London Bridge sound good. Seriously this is excellent.<br /><br />\\"Unspoken\\", Medium pace with Christina leading to way and as with most of the songs a full lush sound and a catchy syncopated beat.<br /><br />\\"The Prophet Said\\", Starting to sound a little like previous songs but still good.<br /><br />\\"Angel's Punishment\\", some reviewers claim this song sounds like Garbage and it does a little. Christina does sound a little like Shirley Manson but also Medeah from Artrosis again.<br /><br />\\"Comalies\\", The title track, a medium slow, quasi-ballad with a big intro but slows for the singers.<br /><br />SUMMATION<br /><br />If I may borrow and paraphrase the title to an old 60s song \\"To Know Them is to Love Them\\" I think that explains all. YES, BUT WOULD I LOVE THEM? Fair question and I'll answer that by saying that if you like or love any of the following bands, yes, you would love them; Evanescence, Garbage, Roxette, Pat Benetar, Joan Jett, Concrete Blonde, even Stevie Nicks.<br /><br />If my \\"Prediction\\" comes through, here is my next prediction. Watch out for Within Temptation, they are already on their way. I did a review on Within Temptation's, Mother Earth (link below) back in June. They are similar to Lacuna Coil but more strident, more symphonic and generally more up tempo.er of appearance follows; <br /> <br />\\"Swamped\\", is an exotic medium slow song with a definite near eastern flavor, with passionate vocals by Andrea and soaring ethereal vocals by Christina. <br /> <br />\\"Daylight Dancer\\", is a medium tempo piece where Andrea takes the lead vocals and Christina in a ethereal mood does backup <br /> <br />\\"Humane\\", my vote for second best song, is a Quasi-ballad with Andrea and Christina swapping lead and backing vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Tightrope\\", a mid tempo song with a slight mid east feeling.

055380457X|4.0|This book certainly provides the buzzwords behind Google's success = \\"Innovation\\", \\"Speed of Change\\", \\"Culture\\", \\"Less planning and more action\\" and a \\"willingness to fail\\". But for the most part it does not really provide detailed insight into the minds of Larry and Sergey.<br /><br />The book however is a must read for anyone considering how to transform their busines in the \\"Customer Age\\". The fact that Google was, and remains focussed first on delivering a great customer experience and then secondarily captitalizing on this financially, is central to the theme.<br /><br />The book contains many valuable lessons, but, also contains some interesting insight into the power of the \\"Stanford\\" old boys network. In fact in many ways it could be considered more of a recruiting book for Stanford than the inside story of Google.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the book lacks real inside commentary and fact and comes across as s series of of essays on Google.<br /><br />However, given the remarkable success of the company, anyone in business should consider reading it to see what of the ideas used they could transalte into their own business.
0143034901|4.0|I received this book second or third hand from some friends and began reading it with absolutely no expectations whatsoever. I completely devoured it! Mr. Zafon had me from the first page. It's a boiling pot of romance and intrigue that bubbles along at an exciting pace. I anxiously await translations of his other work!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If anyone at Fox had a brain, they would be making a three picture deal now. This is the type of movie (and TV series) that will be making money for years. I mean really, how many people want to see Cowboys eating pudding?
B00003CWPL|5.0|I find it highly interesting the reaction that this film provokes - there are very few 3 star reviews but many 5 star  and many 1 star reviews. So is it a classic? We're obviously split, but it is easily the most viscerally unforgettable movie ever, for better or for worse depending on where you stand. <br /> <br />This movie is not \\"fun\\" to watch, so don't expect it for entertainment value. Nor is it an action film - the pacing is slow, and if you give it the chance, quite effective. I would agree with other reviewers that you should watch this before you buy, and be prepared: you are about to have an experience more chilling than any horror movie or more intense than any action movie. If you don't like movies that require the viewer to think deeply and that provoke visceral reactions, you probably shouldn't even try it - you will only end up regretting it because you won't be able to forget it. <br /> <br />It is indeed an \\"art film.\\" However, I would say that the movie's intensity overwhelms the artsy pretentions that in most cases would turn me off immensely.  <br /> <br />The symbolic imagery is kind of open to interpretation, although it seems as though the movie's theme generally revolves around a fear of fatherhood. The meal, the sex scene, the baby, the chipmunk woman in the radiator, the eraser factory and the murder are all highly memorable and symbolic images, characters and scenes from the movie, on which there is an echelon of internet analysis. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this movie to everyone, especially not those who expect their movies to be a fun escape with typical plots, cardboard Hollywood characters and happy endings. Even people with more eclectic tastes may hate this movie. Expect to be repulsed, frustrated and upset by this movie, if you want to watch it.  <br /> <br />I can't really explain what makes this movie my favorite, but I feel like it touches something deep inside of me, a gritty intensity that pulls me in like no other movie.
0679422714|5.0|I was born and lived in the era of Mao's rule.  First-hand witnessed the terror inflicted by Mao at the time. Mass executions (just like the photos in Chang's book) were common in soccer stadiums during Mao's era.  Mao's apparatchiki even \\"invited\\" grade school children to watch it, and called it an education of political science (I believe all Chinese or non-Chinese children would be terrified to watch it).  Nicholas D. Kristof, and  left wingers probably would not have said what they said if they were the victims of Mao (especially not if their own grandsons were thrown into a well because they had used their savings to buy some land before Mao arrived). In this regard, I forgive these ignorant intellectuals.  <br /> <br />All my life I always wanted to understand Mao, because the Mao's government called him a \\"benevolent leader\\", \\"savior of the people\\", but his act were opposite of \\"benevolence\\". It is still not possible to see clearly who Mao was under the current Beijing regime's policy.  Chang's Mao: The Unknown Story sheds some light into the dark tunnel. The book was so captivating to read for me, I finished it in five days and nights.  It answered many of my questions of Mao. Chang's research might not be complete or thourough, but it is a great first step to unmask the disguises surrounding Evil Mao.  I hope the folks doubting Chang's research provide some research of their own to support their skepticism, and don't believe Mao's progaganda either.  Let this book act as an ignitor to truly expose Evil Mao and never let history repeat like this in China or anywhere, again.
B00005JOGU|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman was uncannily stunning in his mesmerizing Oscar worthy portrayal of celebrated author and personality Truman Capote, capturing all the nuances of his multi faceted personality.  Having seen Capote speak on many occasions Hoffman's speech patterns, mannerisms and appearance were eerily authentic.<br /><br />Hoffman's performance takes us through the point in Capote's career when he was researching and creating his highly acclaimed novel \\"In Cold Blood\\".  Capote looking for a new interesting subject was intrigued by the brutal shotgun slaying of a rural Kansas farming family of four.  Hastily embarking to Kansas accompanied by Catherine Keener, wonderfully playing childhood friend and esteemed author of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", Harper Lee they proceed to interview all the important participants of the investigation.<br /><br />Capote gains the confidence of the accused killers Richard Hickcock played by Mark Pellegrino and especially Perry Smith played by Clifton Collins Jr.  Capote empathized with Smith having had similar childhood experiences of being unwanted and shunned.  Capote however would have no compunction in resorting to manipulation and lying to glean precious information to help him complete his book.<br /><br />Capote in effect sells his soul in seducing and befriending the killers and helping then legally.  In the end can't bring himself to face them at the eve of their execution.  Finally relenting, he witnesses the graphic hanging of Perry Smith. He is shattered but reminded by Keener, as his voice of reason, that he never wanted to really save them and deny himself the precious ending of his book.  We learn that this five year expenditure of Capote's time and effort has dried up his creativity.  He never again wrote another book.
B000AP04FG|5.0|This is a two hour indulgence in an old fashion love story plot line but with today's violence, explosives and special effects.  No thinking required.   It certainly did not hurt this movie that Brad and Angelina were embroiled on their own love story when this movie was being filmed.  There's plenty of chemistry going on. <br />It was great seeing the characters in their bored married state and the witty dialog of one liners throughout the movie was hilarious.  The story line was just interesting enough to keep you involved in the movie.  A more sophisticated story line would have been overkill (no pun intended).   <br />A bit predictable.  Is there anyone who didn't know that the ultimate fight scene in the house was going to end up with them getting back together?  But that's okay because this film does not pretend to be anything else but fun. <br />Brad and Angelina should capitalize on their relationship and make a series of remakes of all the classic love story movies from the 40's.   <br /> <br />
B000CNEO1G|5.0|I bought this album not knowing anything about Ms. Balsom, but being a trumpet aficionado (Marsalis, Andre, Alpert, Masekela) was curious as to how a female trumpeter would sound (I confess to having never heard of a female trumpeter). <br /> <br />Well, this CD is terrific. I like Bach's work and she interprets it in a clear and commanding style. It's right up there with my favourite classical trumpet cd, Marsalis' Baroque Music for Trumpets, and I look forward to hearing from and seeing Ms. Balsom here in the States.
B00007KWI9|3.0|Having bought the original shovelware version of Yes' debut when it first was reissued on CD in 1990, I was reluctant to buy the remastered version. What's wrong with the original version?    The remaster didn't blow me away like The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway by Genesis did. To me, \\"Yes\\" sounds thinner than the original; maybe this because the dirty bass guitar isn't cranked up as much. The addition of 15 seconds to Looking Around was a surprise though.    The bonus tracks are good, but not essential (as say, \\"Squid/Octopus\\" on Van der Graaf's H to HE remaster is). The sonic range has been improved, but not drastically.    I recommend keeping your old version.    [DW]

0743424425|5.0|The Shining is a great book. I am sure most people already know that, but I thought I would add my 2 cents. In case you have been living under a rock for the last 25 years - The Torrence family has decided to spend a winter as the caretakers of a reclusive hotel in the mountains. It will only be Mom, Dad, and the little boy isolated for the winter season, buried in nothing but snow and loneliness. The little boy, Danny, has a unique gift -the shining - where he can talk to people with E.S.P. The father also has a gift -the ability to see the ghosts of the hotel. Unfortunately, the ghosts want blood, and to add to the permanent residents of the facility. The decent into madness is one of the best ever described in a book. For those of you that have seen the 1980 Kubrick version, you will be in for a treat, as the ending is substantially different.<br /><br />This is classic King, and should be read alone at night, with the winter winds howling outside, the telephone turned off, and the blanket pulled up tight.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. King.<br /><br />Relic113
B000002OMN|5.0|Meat Loaf, is different, not only is he different amongst other artists but his music differentiates within itself as well; meaning not one song sounds the same. This is what a love about him, he's a breath of fresh air and when I was first introduced to his music I couldn't contain my excitement at how original he is. The songs on this album maybe way overblown and in some ways just purely ridiculous but that is what makes it so great. Never have I heard an artist that purely wears his heart on his sleeve and bravely sings such songs. His voice is just so passionate and he really injects these songs with new life and turns these from good songs to great songs.    I'd do anything for love is just so emotional and nobody could have sang it any better than Meat Loaf. His voice is amazingly powerful but he really hits the lower notes with a T. The song is also very long(twelve minutes!), but it wouldn't be a rock-opera epic if it wasn't and not one of those twelve minutes are wasted. This is probably why it spent 7 consecutive weeks at number #1 in the UK! I have to say hate it when people say 'What is it he won't do for love'. It is very easy to figure out if you just listen to the song.... it's in the beginning and the chorus. The rest of the songs on this album are fantastic. You know you have come across a gem of an album when you can listen to the album all the way through and not get bored at all. I loved all of them especially 'Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are' and 'Out of the Frying Pan (and Into the Fire)'  They are both so different from each other but are sung with an equal amount of emotion that makes you really feel for the characters in the song. Overall, it is a masterpiece and a worthy successor to the original.
0803730470|5.0|the Gruffalo has all the elements of a great read...repetition, rhythm, suspense, humour.  My four year old was in fits - he's gone off to bed muttering 'owl ice cream'! and giggling merrily to himself.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|In 1999, an incredible thing happened in the world of music.  Jennifer Lopez releases her sensational debut, \\"On the Six,\\" which went multiplatinum and scored tons of hits like \\"If You Had My Love,\\" \\"Waiting for Tonight,\\" and \\"Let's Get Loud.\\"  This CD was released at the time she was dating Puff Daddy, and they made such a lovely couple.  Oh, you really need to get this CD.  It is absolutely urgent that you do so.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|that's comparing to his live performance \\"Caught in the Act\\" which I give it a 10 if I can. Buble is pretty new to me, I saw him first last year on that PBS show and later got that DVD. I was totally entranced by his singing. The most smooth, velvety voice I've ever heard. And he can handle both slow, romantic songs and fast, exciting dancing tunes so well. Now I heard this It's Time cd, my impression is in this cd, his voice is a bit too controlled, I feel he is more himself at the concert than at the studio. He really shines with all that chrisma at the concert. I hope people get that DVD, especially those who dismiss him too easily as just another Sinatra wannabe.
0060899190|5.0|I got introduced to the post secret website about a year ago. I forgot all about it until recently, and got hooked onto it again. When I realized there was a book, I knew I had to get it.  <br /> <br />Even though this is considered to be more like a picture book than a real book, it truly speaks volumes - about humanity, and about how we are all so much more the same than different. It is comforting to know that some of the secrets that I myself have are not all that uncommon afterall. Reading other people's secrets have been a wonderful learning experience, it makes me laugh, cry, and view life in a new way.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. It is one of the best books I have read in a while now.
B000B2YQX4|1.0|I've been a Depeche Mode fan for 15 years, since i was 14. Violator was on the air when i first realize about them. As oftenly happens with non native english speakers, at first I was delighted by music before even try to understand lyrics. And at such time i thought that, what really made the difference between depeche and the rest of the british bands playing at the time, was indeed the music, and of course the vocals, but overall...music! it was simply awesome, different from any other melodies around, they don't even sound like coming from computers or synthetizers.   Now,i'm absolutely conviced that music was the difference. You can now understand my deception once Wilder left the band. The depeche mode of the dark era, of the strange sounds, of the glorious and uncomparable tunes had suddenly dissappeared. Now i stare at the instrumentals -which were once upon a time absolutely superb- with horror; i find lot of people saying they have launched probably their best album, and i cannot supress a smile in my face; how can they find those detestable pieces of bad taste -such as exciter and playing the angel- even worth of being mentionned or compared with remarkable works such as Music for the Masses or even with masterpieces, such as Black Celebration? Black celebration is, for me, their best album ever. Violator is one of the greatest. Songs of Faith and Devotion is awesome. But \\"Playing the angel\\"? come'on, are you serious? what happened with the real depeche, the one which even the heaviest band of the 80's and early 90's respected? Should i keep hope of ever listening again something like Behind the Wheel or Little 15, some glorious tunes like that? Or will they keep lauching songs to emulate Madonna? For God's sake.....
0743454529|1.0|Put me with those who loved the book but hated the ending. <br /> <br />Anna fights so hard to have the freedom to choose, and then all choices are taken away from her by death.  Is that a comment on how we don't really have a say in our destiny?  To me, it made Anna powerless.   <br /> <br />I was looking forward to a point when Anna gains the independence to make her own choices.  Then, her relationship with Kate can finally be more equal, honest and open.  Then, the two of them can make their medical decisions together and separately--however is right for them.  But, instead, Anna's free will is taken away yet again.  It felt to me like at first her freedom is taken away by her parents and how they treat her, but at the end it is taken away by the author.  Because the chances of an accident like that at that very moment are so slim--it felt like a conscious decision of the author.  (I could no longer believe in the characters and story as real, but was very aware of it as literature.) <br /> <br />I would have loved to see if Kate would have continued to tell Anna not to donate the kidney, and what Anna would have said back, and what Anna would have chosen.  Both of them are certainly written as mature enough to have those discussions. <br /> <br />About the first monologe--why would Kate want to kill her baby sister?  And then to continue to want to kill her for years?  She seems to deeply love and appreciate Anna.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|At the video store a week ago, I couldn't find anything worth renting and ended up taking a chance on a movie I've never heard of called 'Serenity.' It turned out to be far better than I imagined. I found out that it was based on a TV series called 'Firefly' and started renting that series. The series is nothing short of outstanding! I'd put it on par with some of the outstanding series put out by HBO. I usually shun TV as its mostly predictable with canned regurgitated humor cued with laugh tracks so that those of us who Hollywood thinks are too dumb, unsofisticated, or born yesterday know when to laugh. Firefly breaks the mold of crappy television and gives us something worth watching.
0131103628|5.0|I know, I know - another glowing review... <br /> <br />But seriously - if you want to learn C, and if you've had some exposure to programming, this book is the absolute best book around.  It is the best book on programming I've ever read (and I've read more than a few...). <br /> <br />I learned C via school, and this text was not used.  I've now been programming in C for over 3 years, and just picked up this book.  I just don't understand why this book is not used for every C programming course out there.  It is so clear, so insightful, so succinct.  I thought about buying this book in the past, but passed it up because it was not the assigned textbook and the price seemed a bit too much for 'optional' reading, but now I regret not having it sooner. <br /> <br />So, to the person new to C, or relatively new to programming:  if you want to learn C, if you want to be a better programmer, GET THIS BOOK!  If you're learning C and pointers seem confusing - get this book, K&R explain pointers so clearly they seem trivial. <br /> <br />Yes, this book is biased (slightly) towards UNIX.  But so what?  If you want to be a decent programmer, you need to understand how programs work.  I'm not a Windows hater, but for someone learning programming, sometimes Windows makes it a bit too easy.  Abstractions are good, but to understand what is going on is vital for a programmer.  Unix makes this necessary, which is why it is used widely on universities (that it's cheaper doesn't hurt).  Everything still runs on Windows anyways, so do yourself a favor and buy this book.  Every other programming book will seem bloated and poorly writen after you've read this book.
B00005JOII|5.0|The opening scene of a move shows a tennis ball being hit as the narrator says, \\"I'd rather be lucky than smart.\\"  Then as the ball hits the top of the net and lies perilously poised the voice says, \\"Life is luck.  The ball goes over the net, you win the point.  If the ball lands on your side, you lose the point.\\"<br /><br />Thus begins Woody Allen's newest and one of his most brilliant movies Match Point.  As do most of Mr. Allen's dramatic movies do, this one struggles with the inherent matter of good and bad luck in one's life and the inherent goodness of people.  Reminiscent of the truly brilliant Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point is one of Allen's finest films in the last five years in my opinion.<br /><br />Chris Wilton, played by John Rhys-Meyers, has had a mediocre career a a tennis player.  Rejecting the tournament scene, he opts to teach tennis at an exclusive club.  By day a tennis teacher during his free time he is busy reinventing himself from humble beginnings in Ireland to a man of sophistication and class. But he is pretty much of a fraud as he reads the companion books to Dostoevsky's masterpieces and professes to love opera but is bored beyond belief while attending the real thing.  But all of his rehearsing is put to the test when he meets a polished young man who brings him to his family home and his sister is smitten with him. While Chris takes an interest in Chloe or so it appears, his real interest is in the<br /><br />brash young would be actress and temptress Nola played by ScarlettJohansson.  And now the stage is set for a movie experience fraught with tension as all the while the viewer knows that Allen will provide us not only with a great movie experience but a chance to question our very own morals and the question of luck.<br /><br />I must admit that I found the movie was a bit long at times and a bit dull until the defining moment when I realized the brilliance of this movie.  In addition the English settings of the countryside and the city of London were almost like being there.  I wondered as I thought about this movie if the movie might have taken place elsewhere but came to the conclusion that the story lent itself to the English of wealth that England was the perfect place for this film.<br /><br />But most of all it was the performances which really made me feel as if these people weren't actors but I had a front row seat into their lives with a pair of good binoculars.  Ms. Johansson at such a young age captured the essence of the brash Nola and played her with an edge hardly seen today.  And Mr. Rhys-Meyers, who recently won a Golden Globe award for his portrayal of Elvis, depicted Chris Wilton with an equal amount of poise and sophistication almost as if he indeed was this character.  An equally superb performance was given by Emily Mortimer as Chloe, a lovely but terribly boring wife.<br /><br />A lover of Mr. Allen's comedy since first seeing him on the Tonight Show and his first film Bananas, his recent films have left me wanting for more. But Match Point most assuredly  revived my love for the serious side of Mr. Allen's work.  Best of all this film has left wanting to see Crimes and Misdemeanors and pondering the moral and ethical questions both movies raise.  I highly recommend this movie to all. Finally I wonder if I will ever look at a ball and a net in just the same way as I did before seeing this film.e and the city of London were almost like being there.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I honestly don't see how Room on Fire is any less superb an album than Is this It was. After only a few listens through I was loving EVERY track. Same great flavor only improved and sold under a different brand name.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|TRY! is a great album from an awesome trio. John Mayer is pop, he will always be. That is thanks to Your body is a wonderland. But John has grown as a person and an artist from those acoustic poppy days. TRY! was never said to be a blues album..... not souly anyways...... it is a pop album with a blues edge. You all have to admit some of the guitar on here is beautiful music to your ears. \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Out of my mind\\" are perfect examples of just how good of a guitar player he is. The lyrics all make sense. John has a way of writing things that most of us want to say, and most of us feel but cannot say them in the elegant way that he writes it out. He is a good artist, he is definately the better ones out there today and gets absolutely no credit. <br /> <br />Everyone here who gave him a bad review, I bet, is still comparing his voice to Dave Matthews and saying all he knows how to do is write loveydovey songs about girls body parts. <br /> <br />John is grown, he is an excellent artist. <br /> <br />This CD proves it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Like most albums, this album takes about three listens to fully enjoy. But what an album! The vocal harmonies are smashing, the instrumental tracks are interesting, and there is not a single boring moment! There is an obvious lack of guitar, but it doesn't matter much to me. This is a classic in its own right, and it definitely should not be compared with Sgt. Pepper. Two different album, two different bands. It's all about taste. Just forget about thinking which is better and enjoy the sounds of both. Oh, and a reviewer mentioned how this wasn't even in the top ten of '66. Completely false. This beats Face to Face (barely), Velvet Underground and Nico, and Fifth Dimension, although those albums were wonderful too. Let's just say '66 was a great year for rock and leave it at that.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|In 1978, I didn't even know that Van Halen was around. It was about a few years later that I discovered who they were. I still can't believe that all these classics came from that album! Jamie's Cryin', Eruption, Ice Cream Man, Ain't Talkin' Bout Love and others are still catchy, rocking songs!  The lead guitar of Eddie Van Halen and the swagger of David Lee Roth are fully represented in these songs. It has a pop music feel to it, but they keep the rock within the songs. This debut set the tone and influence for future guitarists that are playing in today's top bands. Almost all of them say that Van Halen was their first or second favorite album of all time and Eddie was their guitar hero. I didn't hear some of the songs until Best of Volume 1 from 1996. Some rap/hip-hop artists have sampled the riffs of it, and while Eddie was complaining, he probably didn't know the impact his guitar playing had on all music genres. This is a true pop classic in all senses of the word!
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|The storyline was decent enough. But it was no \\"Incredibles.\\" The special effects could have been a lot better. They were pretty bad. And a bit more imagination as far as special powers could have been used. They basically just picked up a copy of an X-Men comic and stole all the ideas in there. I even noticed that they stole some stuff out of \\"Incredibles.\\" But I liked the characters. Especially the plant girl who was the Poison Ivy rip off.
B000001ELL|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />After a two year hiatus (the previous year saw the release of the four KISS solo albums) KISS returned with a brand new studio album, \\"Dynasty,\\" (1979) their first since \\"Love Gun\\" (1977).<br /><br />The consensus among many music critics is that \\"Dynasty\\" is the album which saw KISS \\"jump the shark.\\" The KISS ARMY is largely split on this one. While some view \\"Dynasty\\" as the beginning of the end, others rate it highly alongside such classics as \\"Love Gun,\\" \\"Destroyer\\" (1976) and \\"Alive\\" (1975).<br /><br />I personally love this album. The main criticism is that it sounds too commercial, too poppy, etc. While the album does feel slick and while \\"I was made for lovin' you\\" would no doubt make the Be Gees proud, \\"Dynasty\\" is still most definitely a rock album. While other KISS fans would beg to differ, I feel \\"Dynasty\\" stands as one of the band's best albums.  The album is very well-written with killer hooks, so really \\"selling out\\" made for an extremely captivating and catchy collection of songs.<br /><br />It should be noted that with \\"Dynasty\\" the band started to collaborate with outside writers. In terms of the band's 70s out-put is concerned, I would rank \\"Dynasty\\" above \\"Hotter than Hell\\" (1974) \\"Dressed to Kill,\\" (1975) and \\"Rock N' Roll Over\\" (1976) and slightly below \\"KISS,\\" (1974) \\"Alive,\\" \\"Love Gun\\" and \\"Alive II\\" (1977).<br /><br />KISS has the notorious reputation of jumping on the bandwagon of whatever is the flavor on the month and that really started here with this album. The Stanley/Desmond Child/Vincent Poncia pure disco \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\" is probably the catchiest, most infectious song of KISS's career. So while most bands would be chastised for such an obvious sell-out, KISS is given a free pass because this song is pure ear-candy. Guitarist Ace Frehley lends his vocal talents to an outstanding cover of The Rolling Stone's \\"20th Century Man,\\" which outshines the original. The seductive disco-tinged \\"Sure Know Something\\" (Stanley/Poncia) is another song that might not be so out-of-place on the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) soundtrack. The Peter Criss sung \\"Dirty Livin'\\" (Criss/Poncia/Penridge) is perhaps the most underrated song on the CD. This hard-rocking disco-tinged ode to excess stands as one of the band's best songs. It should be noted that \\"Dirty Living\\" is the only song that Peter Criss plays on \\"Dynasty.\\" Due to his continuing erratic behavior and substance abuse, Anton Fig stepped in for the Cat Man as a ghost drummer for the rest of the album. The somewhat off-beat Gene Simmons sung \\"Charisma\\" (Simmons/Marks) throws the album a curve-ball, but is effective and keeps up the momentum. Stanley's \\"A Magic Touch\\" may not have been good enough to be released as a single, but is still a better than average rocker. Ace Frehley's \\"Hard Times\\" is basically filler and a bit of a disappointment when you consider how great his '78 solo album was, but it's not bad. Gene Simmon's melodic \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" is a continuation of the style that had so worked for him on his '78 solo album, but the Beatle-esque harmonies are eschewed in favor of a more KISS flavored sound. \\"Dynasty\\" ends on a very strong note with Frehley's hard-rocking, edgy \\"Save Your Love,\\" which is easily up-to-par with the best of his work from his '78 solo album.<br /><br />While \\"Dynasty\\" was a huge hit upon release, it ultimately wound-up hurting the band in the long run. While \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\" no doubt thrilled the masses, the KISS ARMY was left scratching its head. For KISS purists, the idea of KISS doing a pure disco song on a disco-tinged album was very off-putting. And while \\"Dynasty\\" struck the right balance between commercial pop and hard-rock, the scale was tipped in the direction of the former for KISS's next album \\"Unmasked\\" (1980) which further led the band astray. So while \\"Dynasty\\" is a fine album, it was the beginning of what would be a dark period in the band's lengthy career.Know Something\\" (Stanley/Poncia) is another song that might not be so out-of-place on the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) soundtrack.

B000AU9UYC|5.0|In my opinion, Batman Begins is the best Batman movie ever made. Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne superbly.  I also think he portrays the Batman character as well as any of the past previous stars (Michael Keaton, George Clooney & Val Kilmer).  <br /> <br />As with most Batman movies of the past, this one begins with a young Bruce Wayne witnessing both his parents being murdered in cold blood. <br /> <br />At a very young age, he vows to devote his life to fighting crime.  <br /> <br />After spending time in some sort of prison facility, Bruce meets up with Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who introduces him to martial arts.  After mastering martial arts, Bruce is now slated to lead a group of ninjas, with the consent of Henri Ducard.  His initiation consists of his killing a past criminal.   <br /> <br />Bruce decides this is not the way he wants to fight crime. In turn, he decides to fight the very group he's trained with for so long.  This does not please Henri Ducard at all.  <br /> <br />After a brief battle, Bruce ends up out of the group.  With no where to turn, Bruce finds his way back to his hometown, Gotham City.  It is here where he meets childhood sweetheart, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes).  It is also here that he decides to come up with the Batman gimmick.   <br /> <br />With Gotham City in such disarray, Bruce is determined to bring the city back to respectability by fighting crime. This is his passion.  <br /> <br />Once Bruce becomes Batman, he eventually goes head to head with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a real mask-wearing psycho, played by Cillian Murphy.  Dr. Crane, better known as \\"The Scarecrow\\" is a big-time drug dealer that has been running rough-shod over the competition.   <br /> <br />Let the battles begin.   <br /> <br />The cast in this movie consists of such veterans as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer & Gary Oldman.   <br /> <br />Caine plays the part of Alfred very well.  Morgan Freeman plays the part of Lucius Fox, who introduces Bruce Wayne to the batmobile.  He is memorable in this role as a good guy. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Rutger Hauer plays bad guy Earle, who has been running The Wayne Foundation ever-since the murder of Bruces' parents.  He will do anything and everything to stay in this position.  But boy does Bruce foil his plan when he returned to Gotham City.   <br /> <br />Gary Oldman plays good-cop, Jim Gordon, who helps Batman in any way he can.  Nice to see Oldman in this role. <br /> <br />Lots of good action and fight scenes follow in this very-good remake of Batman.   <br /> <br />This is a must see for any Batman follower.
B00003CXAW|5.0|As much as I enjoyed Peter Jackson's remake, the original \\"Kong\\" remains the definitive version.  While awaiting the remake's arrival to theaters, I elected to order the special edition dvd of the original.  Comparing the dvd to a vhs tape I had, I was impressed by the improvement in picture and sound.  The image was much cleaner and didn't jump around like on the tape.  Especially when I got to the scenes on Skull Island, I was able to appreciate the artistry of the matte paintings and compositions more than I ever had before.  Willis O'Brien's animation was amazing for the time and is still remarkably effective in this world of CGI marvels.  The commentary with Ray Harryhausen is a treat to listen to and full of interesting tidbits.  The documentaries of the second disc are equally informative--revealing what a groundbreaking film \\"Kong\\" was in terms of effects, sound, musical score.  The talented crew worked long hours to create the film's elaborate effects--often inventing new techniques when the old ones would not suffice.  The truly remarkable thing is how Kong becomes such a tragic figure.  We take it for granted now in our era of ecological awareness, but there was no endangered species act in 1933.  What Carl Denham does to Kong was perfectly normal at the time.  Nothing in the script suggests that Merian Cooper ever meant \\"Kong\\" to be a tragedy.  But Willis O'Brien's animation is so expressive that you can't help but identify with and root for the big monkey.  When he falls from the Empire State building, we fall with him.  Anyway, great dvd--loved Peter Jackson's spider pit recreation sequence--definitely a must for any serious collector.

B000AP04FG|4.0|What a great premise as a backdrop to this little adventure flick!  The film in no place takes itself seriously, yet it does engage you and keep your attention.  There is enough tongue-in-cheek humor spread through the comic-book style action to keep most people entertained.  If you want a little \\"Jackie Chan marries James Bond\\" type of action, this is the film for you.
B00005JNTX|4.0|If this were a straight \\"movie review,\\" I'd give Robert Rodriguez's (and Frank Miller's) \\"Sin City\\" five stars.  But this is a DVD review, so the product itself gets a mere four stars.  Buyers beware -- there is a \\"Recut, etc.\\" edition of this DVD that has a heck of a lot more in the way of cookies, extras, and all those other little treats that make DVDs so much fun.  This is a \\"smaller\\" DVD with fewer extras.  Make sure you're buying the correct edition. <br /> <br />On to the movie.  \\"Sin City\\" throws the audience into Frank Miller's ultra-hard-boiled comic metropolis, Basin City (aka \\"Sin City\\").  One wonders how this city functions, as its only inhabitants appear to be cops (generally corrupt, with one lone exception), prostitutes (generally, with one lone exception, with hearts of gold), criminal scum, and corrupt politicians.  I pity the schoolteacher who works at Basin City Senior High School. <br /> <br />A revolutionary use of digital filmmaking technology allows \\"Sin City\\" to be told in the same stark black-and-white color scheme that makes Frank Miller's graphic novels so much fun.  There are occasional blasts of color, but generally black-and-white rules the day.   <br /> <br />Fans of Miller's graphic novels will see no surprises in \\"Sin City,\\" other than the technical skill with which the filmmakers translate the comix to the big screen.  This is almost a shot-for-shot remake of three graphic novels:  \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" \\"The Big Fat Kill,\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard.\\"  There is also a very brief short story that sort of bookends the film, based on Miller's short tale \\"The Babe Wore Red.\\"  These are essentially the same stories exactly as Miller wrote them in his graphic novels, only slightly truncated for time. <br /> <br />But the tone is all there.  Miller's Holy Trinity appears to be \\"Bullets, Booze and Broads,\\" the title of his collection of short story comix set in Basin City.  And boy, does this movie bring the goods. <br /> <br />I'll leave thesummarizing of the plot for other reviewers.  I'll just give you my reaction.  \\"Sin City\\" is one of those movies that qualifies as a \\"Great Guilty Pleasure.\\"  There's nothing \\"redeeming\\" or \\"important\\" or \\"telling a story that needs to be told\\" in \\"Sin City.\\"  It's Dashiell Hammet's \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" for the 21st century.  The acting is all just this side of over-the-top, which qualifies as perfectly restrained given Miller's hyperbolic stories.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen . . . these are fine actors, but \\"they don't do nuance.\\"  And that's perfectly appropriate.  There are several fine performances by the actresses, too, as Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba emerge as the most memorable amongst the bevy of beauties who live in Sin City's Amazonia, Old Town.   <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Sin City\\" is a thrill ride, the kind of movie where a man can describe his girlfriend as a \\"Valkyrie,\\" and it comes across as perfectly appropriate, given the hard-boiled circumstances.  Check it out, but just make sure you're buying the right DVD edition.
B00005JOM9|5.0|Transamerica confronts the notion of gender issues through the appearance of a road movie, as Stanley 'Bree' Osbourne (Felicity Huffman) unwillingly enters the past.  A past with dreadfully painful memories of rejection brought back through a forgotten, awkwardly, happenstance sexual encounter some 17-years ago that conceived a child.  While in present time, Bree completely focuses on her own frail existence to complete her own transformation from a man to a woman through sex reassignment surgery.  The surgery, a self-conformation of her own identity, reaches beyond the traditional notion of gender relating to the biological aspects of having an additional X-chromosome or not, which determines the sexual organ of a man or woman.<br /><br />The overwhelming amount of emotions that submerge Bree render strong anxiety with her.  In order to cope she sees a psychologist, Margaret (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a), who also has helped her jump the hurdles to complete her transformation.  With the date of the surgery rapidly approaching, her anxiety intensifies and her feelings about her operation only strengthen in the shadow of fear.  Thus, when an unexpected phone call raises her awareness that she has a son, fear digs its claws deep within her persona.  It elevates the defenses within her, as she develops a cold and callous wall around herself towards anything that presents a threat of preventing her surgery.  However, Margaret will not sign the approval papers of Bree's sex reassignment surgery until Bree travels across the United States from California to New York to see what help her 17-year old son Toby (Kevin Zegers) needs.<br /><br />The reunion between Bree and Toby is not what the audience expects, as Bree pretends being someone else and not Toby's dad.  Instead, Bree takes the role of a female Samaritan Christian helping Toby get out of his doomed situation that surrounds drugs and prostitution.  It is a fitting character, as Bree appears both uptight and frigid.  In all honesty, she needs to get out in the sun far more.  However, it seems to be her way of protecting her identity in the fear of what others might think of her.  In addition, Toby is not anything that Bree, or the audience would imagine, as a scruffy looking teenager emerge from within the New York City's police station.  Yet, together they make a perfect couple, as parent and son.  The only issue is that Bree never allows Toby to know the truth when they meet.<br /><br />Through some of the initial conversations, Bree learns that Toby wants to go to California and become an actor, and offers him a ride all the way to California.  This trip across America sets up the story, but it also has an allegorical function, as it presents the idea that transgender people and people with gender identity issues exist all through the American continent.  A notion strengthened through their Texas stop along the way to the Orange state.  However, the story is so much more than a mere \\"more power to film.\\"  The story exposes genuine coming of age issues within a dysfunctional family, the reunion of two lost (one young and one old) souls that empower each other, the connection between a parent and their teen and much more.  It is even fascinatingly poignant how both Bree and Toby get on each others nerves in a genuine manner such as Bree correcting Toby's grammar and Toby not listening to the older and wiser Bree.  The trip has many bumps along the road, but it is though these anxiously painful bumps that true humanity and compassion emerge.<br /><br />It is true that the film has an empowering message, but it also displays the importance of understanding and acceptance from both sides.  As mentioned, Transamerica does not display a one-tracked thought through Bree and Toby, but a complex mix of human emotions that creates turmoil, anxiety, and happiness.  In essence, the film does portray an authentic perspective on life with all of its hardships including all of its tangible and intangible aspects (i.e., physical, psychological, or social), as social restriction exercises its power of what people find acceptable, or not.  Ultimately, Transamerica transcends through poignant resolution and acceptance that radiates absolute recognition of the individual identity regardless of beliefs, morals, and values.intangible aspects (i.e., physical, psychological, or social), as social restriction exercises its power of what people find acceptable, or not.

B00006RCNW|5.0|I thought Law & Order had set the bar pretty high for a cop serial (even though it doesn't focus spc. on the cops, I know, I know), but as far as entertainment goes, you can't beat The Shield. <br /> <br />You can guarantee what's going to happen on Law & Order: someone's gonna get murdered, and there will be a trial. The Shield guarantees none of that, except maybe the murder. If there is a trial, you ain't gonna see it, and if Det. Vic Mackey and his Strike Team deal with a problem the way they want, ain't gonna be no trial, either. <br /> <br />Following a team of cops that are corrupted to varying degrees puts a whole new slant on the cop show. It's hard to know whether to cheer for Mackey or not as he makes decisions that frequently have little to do with police ethics.  <br /> <br />Cringe as he doesn't remove children from a crackhouse, but instead advises the owner \\"to put 'em in the back room and rent the Lion King... just keep them away from this s***.\\"  Watch in disbelief as he beats a hooker (at her request) so that her story about killing a john will wash with the cops. <br /> <br />And through all this, Mackey is a) trying to avoid the net of Capt. Aceveda, which gets tighter and tighter following the wickedest decision Mackey makes in the series' first episode and b) trying to save his family and his son, whose learning disability becomes painfully clear midway through the first season. <br /> <br />Add a stellar cast of characters and just the right amount of T&A, violence and ignorant jokes (hey, what can I say, I'm a 24-year-old male...), and you've got an appallingly great show that I'm just now getting into. <br /> <br />I watched the first season in less than two days. Probably ditto for the second season, which just came in today's mail. Compelling is the only way to describe it. Can't wait for the new season on F/X. <br /> <br />If you're a big Law & Order fan, and ESPECIALLY if you liked Homicide: Life on the Street, this is the show for you.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This has got to be the best movie ever!  And I am not talking about movies about Jesus or the Bible either, I'm talking about ALL movies!  This movie far surpasses any other Christian movie I have ever seen in my life.  It truly shows what Jesus went through and is accurate to history!  There is one thing that I don't really like about the movie and that is the fact that it is not in English.  It does have English subtitles but sometimes it is a little hard to keep up with them as the movie moves quickly at times.  Other than that, it is an excellent movie with the best story ever told!
B0007VZ91C|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this so much. It's beautiful to read to,  work to, or bask in it's glow. I'm looking forward to other recordings by Deva premal.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|This was the first Enya CD I bought. I have always loved the music from the movie \\"Titanic\\" and remember someone saying to check out Enya if you like the music from \\"Titanic\\". I was in Florida visting my friend and decided to try and find one of her CDs. I listened to this all the way home.  This CD is great.  My favorites are Less Then a Pearl, It's In The Rain, The River Sings and Amarantine. A few days later I got A Day Without Rain and I loved that too. I also got Paint the Sky With Stars. Enya's voice is just beautiful. I really would recommend this CD, esp if you enjoyed the \\"Titanic\\" music.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|I am getting sick and tired of people picking on Britney, arguably the greatest singer that ever lived.  She's beautiful, talented, classy, and she does it all!  She has money, fame, respect, a loving husband, a BABY, and a Grammy.  A GRAMMY!  This hits album is essential listening for any music fan worth his or her salt.  To ignore it is to risk scorn.  Ignore the haters and give Britney her due!

B000AP04FG|4.0|\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is an entertaining romp of action, adventure, and yes, even comedy.  Vince Vaughan plays a supporting role, perhaps a bit too small, but he provides the comedic relief.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith.  They are married to each other yet live completely separate lives as hired assassins.  They are both hired to kill...each other.  Sounds rather silly, but I think it was done pretty well.  It was well paced, filled with great action, snappy dialogue, and also quite stylish at that.<br /><br />\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is a fun film to rent on any night.  I just happened to watch it on Saturday.
B000002JK2|5.0|Hey, all all star collaborative efforts should be like this. This album shows what Townshend would have been capable of in The Who with someone like Ronnie to compete with. While Entwistle was a good song writer, he was no genius, and not even interested in trying to be, concentrating mostly on his bass playing. While Ronnie may not be Townshend quality, he's great, and it forced Pete to heights he hadn't achieved in a long time. If The Who had Ronnie in it from the beginning, they'd have been better than The Beatles. <br /> <br />The album runs the gauntlet from hard charging roots rock to beautiful ballads, to massive Townshend experimentation. It's kind of a schizophrenic album, but everything is done with such gall, such joy, and such pure craft, that the album is a delight the whole time its on. The most fun album of Townshend's career (both Who and solo) and while it may not make it his best, it makes is a huge highlight. Find it, buy it, love it.
B000000OAN|5.0|I'm not sure how much the 30th anniversity EDition is better, but I can honestly say this is a great album.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarintino does it again. He releases a movie with extreme violence and harsh language. This time it is Kill Bill Volume 1. It is a story of an assassin (Uma Thurmin) who is betrayed by her boss and fellow assassins. The Bride (Uma's Nickname in the movie) spends the rest of the movie out to get revenge on those who betrayed her. There are several bloody scenes in this movie. So don't let the small children take a peek. Several of the scenes are comical especailly when people's heads get chopped off, and an unrealistic amount of blood squirts out. There is a whole lot of action in this movie, lot's of kung-fu violence that will keep you at the edge of your seat. One of my favorite moments is the first fight scene where The Bride fights the character played by Vivica A Fox. It's hilarious when Vivica's daughter walks in on them fighting and the two of them are standing there a bloody mess. The fight scenes near the end are very good too. This movie is great for any action movie fan and I recommend it for any blood thirsty movie fan.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Pink Floyd is without a doubt one of the best rock groups of all time. and this album is a testament to that, i give it only four stars because it doesn't have Welcome to the Machine, one of my alltime favs. but overall this is a fantastic album and something every music lover should have
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Since I can only recall the 1976 version, which I liked very much as a kid (I was only 5 years old or something when I first saw the film), it had such an impact in my mind as a kid, that I had several king kong or gorilla toys. <br /> <br />I have not seen the original movie so far, therefore I only have the 1976 version as a reference. Looking back at it now as an adult, I agree that it is not really a good action/adventure movie and that the impression of having a giant ape was not achieved because of the proportions of the ape(it is clearly a human in an ape costume, but it didn't matter to me when I was a kid), as well as other \\"special effects\\" really look fake to me. Then, I saw the \\"King Kong lives\\" version of the 80's and kinda liked it (I was a teenager by then), but it fell even shorter than the 1976 version and lacked logic and coherence. But algother, I think at the end, I thought it was like an \\"iconic\\" movie franchise that really did not needed to be looked at in a serious way again and was kinda \\"shelved up\\" inside my memory along with all the good movies I liked as a kid, but surely would be laughable to me if I saw them again. This really seemed an even more \\"dead\\" franchise than the Batman franchise (another of my favorite icons as a kid, which I am really pleased to say was \\"revived\\" again in all its glory with the new \\"Batman begins\\" Chris Nolan movie....awesome movie!!! whereas the Schuhmacher versions can be really put to oblivion and the Burton versions were OK, but seemed too \\"cartoonish\\" to me), but it took Peter Jackson to make magic in every possible way to make this movie a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Although most of my friends rave about and praise the LOTR trilogy, I only really like the last 2 of the series(in the first movie you could easily save like 45 minutes of the movie if you took away Frodo's annoying panic gestures shots that lasted for at least 5 minutes each, I don't know, I just felt it as being too long) and then, of the last 2, the Return of the King is really a \\"classic\\" to me. Of course, some folks cannot see the trilogy as individual parts and rave about the whole trilogy, but this is my opinion. <br /> <br />Well, I am happy of having given it a shot, since when I first learned that Peter Jackson was making a remake of King Kong, I thought... why bother?? But since it was Peter Jackson's version I thought I might give it a shot and I'm glad I did. I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters, and, if given the opportunity, I would see it once more. Sure, I agree with some of the reviewers about the dinosaur stampede, which could easily have been cut down to some minutes as well as the insect/weird worm scene... it's totally unnecessary for me to extend those scenes the way P Jackson did, but I think it was necessary to have the hour long wait for the big hairy guy to appear, since we get to see the human side and motivations of the main characters. <br /> <br />It was awesome to see Kong in the different action scenes whereas the 1976 really fell short with that totally uncomprehensible plastic fake snake fight scene. Apart from that scene, we only see him in action in New York, and that is, for a short time. When I saw the dinosaurs in the movie trailers, I thought... why even bother putting dinosaurs on a movie again? Another Jurassic Part deja vu? Dinosaurs meets Kong kinda \\"monster vs. monster\\" type of thing? It was just until recently that I learned that they were included in the 1933 version, and most likely, were one of the first attempts in movie history, to include dinosaurs on movies. But the snake scene, barely had a purpose for me on the 76 version as no other strange Skull Island creature was brought to life on this version, thus, cutting down the \\"action\\" factor. <br /> <br />It was also awesome to see the development of the relationship between Kong and Ann, where I think Jackson really did an awesome job. I don't even think that it was a \\"man-woman\\" love the one that was developed on screen, it was more like a big admiration and friendship they felt for eachother. <br /> <br />But well... I cannot wait to have it on DVD, but I hope I don't have to wait for several versions of the DVD to come out to get the \\"special edition\\" or whatever Universal wants to call it, including the \\"making of\\" documentary right from the first DVD version they make available.
B000002KMY|4.0|I absolutely love the subcategory known as \\"power metal\\". Oddly enough, Black Sabbath hadn't been known for this type of music during Ozzie's tenure. Their music was mostly of the \\"doom metal\\" or \\"black metal\\" (non thrash) type. Out goes Ozzie. In comes Dio and out comes some of the best power metal on which my ears have ever feasted. 'Heaven and Hell' may be their greatest collection of heavy metal (I know, blasphemy to you Ozzie lovers) but as far as \\"power metal\\" is concerned, 'The Mob Rules' may even be better. A few songs on 'Heaven and Hell' featured lyrical themes (penned by Ronnie James Dio) normally associated with power metal but the music was more along the lines of classic metal. On 'The Mob Rules', the lyrical themes of sorcery, pseudo-biblical-prophecy with battlefield imagery and the music came together to create a potent blend of power metal. 'Turn Up The Night' starts the cd (album when released) with great energy from the band and great vocal aggression and grit from Dio. 'Voodoo' slows things down considerably but doesn't detract from the experience in the least. Not only does Dio have an incredible voice for this music but he certainly has a knack for lyrics (\\"call me a liar, you knew...you were a fool but that's cool, it's alright\\"). 'The Sign of the Southern Cross' is this albums' epic. Starts very mellow then kicks into a slow, evil sounding riff before Dio joins in perfectly. 'E5150' is one of those atmospheric, landscaping pieces of sound that I can't really classify as music however it's great for setting up the next song which is the album's title track. 'The Mob Rules' has the fastest, meanest riff on the cd and Dio's vocals (how many times am I going to say this?) are just perfect. I love the lyrics (\\"close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call, death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall..oh!!!\\").'Country Girl' is my least favorite song but it's not bad. The riff to 'Slipping Away' may havebeen over used but it combines the best aspects of call and response and a macho strut. Listen and you'll know what I mean. If you're not familiar with power metal, 'Falling Off the Edge of The World' is a near perfect example. It's classic power metal in both music and lyrics. Splendid use of tempo, excellent riff, thundering drums, perfect amount of aggression, the theme is spot on (\\"help  me, tell me I'm sane...I feel a change in the earth and the wind and the rain\\") and Dio's vocal delivery is ripe with his trademark dramatic delivery. I would've loved to have been in the studio to see if he did his classic hand gestures during the recording. Finally, 'Over and Over' closes the cd with a slow but no less burning piece of power metal that leaves me wanting more. Sadly, this was Dio's last studio album with Black Sabbath for a number of years (but they did reconvene to produce the excellent 'Dehumanizer'). If you're a fan of power metal bands such as Man-O-War, Metal Church, Savatage and Sword, this will fit nicely in your collection.
B000002UAU|1.0|Simply overated! Imagine and Plastic Ono Band are better albums.If you want humor spend your money on a George Carlin CD.
0385510454|4.0|Joel Backman is a DC powerbroker who goes to jail for hiding international secret intelligence, and later gets a pardon from the President. The CIA moves him to Italy to find out what country wants to kill him so they can learn more about the hidden info. I enjoyed the audiobook version a great deal. Michael Beck who is the audiobook reader gives you spoken Italian accents which help draw you into the characters more than if you just read it. (I suppose) Good book, good suspense.
B000002KBU|1.0|I think this album more than any Joni Mitchell album shows how weak she is musically and no sense of rythym whatsoever. She just seems to show off her vocal range within these songs and everything just seems disjointed and out of balance. If there is anyone out there that agrees with this, I'd liketo hear from you.By the way I love Court and Spark. It had more cohesive song arrangments and the vocals melted into the music.
B00005MP58|5.0|Even in sixth grade when I first read the novel, I was absolutely enchanted by both the story and of course, Mr. Darcy. So when I happened to pass the A&E series in my library, I knew it was love at first sight, and was not disappointed. Though many have complained that Colin Firth was too \\"sexual,\\" nowhere in the story does it mention that he is plain or dull. I have since received a romance movie collection with P&P in it and have nearly worn out the copy on sick days and rainy weekends. Break out some chocolate and a warm shawl - you'll want it to last forever!
B000AMUU94|5.0|This set is great. If you like Bowie's music but don't know where to start with his albums, this is the answer to your prayers. It features all the well-known radio songs, plus a lot of great music you probably haven't heard. I bought it three days ago and haven't stopped listening to it since.
006097625X|5.0|Okay, so it's really the only in depth book on the subject. But if there were others it would still be the best. This is not only a great book on the art of comics but visual language in general and I would recommend it to anyone going into the graphic arts.
0812550706|5.0|This book is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read. I found it fairly surprising that I loved this book so much because I don't usually read books catagorized as Sci-fi. Card has such a wonderful gift and writes in a very captivating manner. This book goes beyond science fiction, into significant areas of thought. I also enjoyed finding myself in his wonderful characters. Ender's Game is a great book that I would recommend to any reader.
0694003611|5.0|Does it go without saying that this book is classic?  Touching, yet simple, never cloyingly sweet.  The brief good-nights are easy for young children to remember, and the phrases tend to stick with you into adulthood, carrying with them sweet childhood memories (I say that, and I'm a die-hard cynic).   <br /> <br />I'm writing more to recommend this board book edition as a great baby gift.  For that kid who's going to have everything he or she NEEDS and who's had a hundred baby showers already, a book is a PERFECT gift.  And, as a librarian, I can vouch for the fact that board books are multi-purpose items:  for whatever reason, toddlers love to carry these things around like a favorite stuffed animal.  And what better way to get them started on the path to reading? <br /> <br />So, there you have it:  a timeless children's classic in the ultimate child-friendly form.
B0000669JL|5.0|this cd is totaly awesome. any bob marley song you know is on this this album. i dont care if you buy it or download it, you need this cd. its not a cd with a couple of good songs and the rest are crappy. every song on this beast is sweet.
B00005JNX0|2.0|I'm sorry, but this film wasn't all that great. Yes, there were a few laugh out loud moments, such as the leamur king and the skelleton arm, however, overall i found myself bored through just about all of it.     The plot isn't really anything new: Marty the Zebra wants to leave his life at the zoo and live in the wild, but his friends want to stay put. THere is a little bit of conflict between the Zebra and his LIon friend, but it's trivial and almost stupid.     When this movie was finished I was left with a feeling of \\"Okay, that was a big waste of time.\\" My brother loved it and I'm sure other little kids will find it funny, but for me it just didn't work well at all.
0060194995|5.0|This is a really beautiful copy of an all-time favorite.  It's a good gift for someone who has already read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and loved it.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I study, work, go to the gym and to the cinema, and still have some extra time to watch tv. Truth to be told, I don't have that much extra time, so I like to take advantage of it by watching only series that are very good. \\"Grey's anatomy\\" is simply excellent :)<br /><br />The plot is not overly complicated, but what really makes this show different, when comparing it to others, is the superb cast and of course the great storylines. \\"Grey's anatomy\\" tells us about the lives of five surgical interns: Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), \\"Izzie\\" Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Christina Yang (Sandra Oh), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight ) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Moreover, we also get to know about their teachers, teachers that in the case of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) become much more than that.<br /><br />In one of the many episodes that this dvd has, Meredith says that \\"We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time, heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day. Still sometimes we have to see for ourselves. We have to make our own mistakes. We have to learn our own lessons. We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore. Until we finally understand for ourselves what Benjamin Franklin really meant. That knowing is better than wondering, that waking is better than sleeping, and even the biggest failure, even the worst, beats the hell out of never trying\\". Please give this dvd a try as soon as it is released. You won't regret it! Of course, highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
1400049628|3.0|This books has some good points to consider, yet on a whole I found it frustratingly inconsistent. Mr. Brooks regularly refers to recorded zombie attacks but negelects to include all of these attacks in his timeline. He includes many, but not all. I find this to be a critical omission. Who knows what sort of information about tactics, zombie behavior, and whatnot could be gleaned from these encounters? I assert that it is not Mr. Brooks' responsibility to be a guardian of this specialized knowledge, but such information should be in the hands of the general public. He even says as much in the book. <br /> <br />However, when he's right, he's right. His suggestion about maintaining a clear zone around your wall so zombies don't simply walk over each other and into your domicile is brilliant, and his recommendation of a pistol/carbine combination, although suggested only once and seemingly forgotten, is actually the course of action one should take. His suggestions about firearms in general, however, indicates that he has limited knowledge in that arena. If his assertion that a melee weapon is best is true, I suppose this matters little. But honestly. These are zombies. You NEED a gun. He recommends the 22. rimfire and does warn of its lack of penetration power, but it is too small a weapon for the task at hand. Something like a .32 or .380 is small, lightish and cheapish, but has the penetration power to pierce the brain cavity and hopefully mushroom a little bit, increasing brain tissue damage. Also, let me say that he is not entirely correct about grenades. They are, after all, specialized weapons. Offensive HE grenades can be quite useful. It is true that defensive fragmentation grenades are of little use on zombies (and even that is not entirely true, such as in the context of an 'airstrike' detonation), but offensive HE grenades are designed to blow things apart by concussive blast, not shrapnel, and that could easily scramble a zombie's brain. <br /> <br />I actually wonder if Mr. Brooks is not a student of the esoteric school of writing, since so many of his throwaway suggestions are more valuable than the alleged 'main points' of his work. <br /> <br />In short: A valuable book - but not the only source you'll need.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|\\"Metallica: Some kind of monster\\" is a peculiar documentary on a famous metal rock band intent on recording a new album, something that ends up taking years, and a lot of pain and fights among band members.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I am not a fan of Metallica, I must say that I enjoyed watching this film. It has plenty of things to interest spectators, as it gives them the opportunity to witness the making of \\"St Anger\\" (Metallica's new album) and the dynamics of a strangely dysfunctional band. Of course, I must also mention Metallica's sessions with Phil Towle, a \\"performance enhancement coach\\", as one of the highlights of this dvd :)<br /><br />In my opinion, fans will love this dvd, and people who have barely heard about Metallica will like it too. \\"Metallica: Some kind of monster\\" is a very good documentary worth watching, even if it is not the kind of dvd you generally rent.<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000BBOUU4|3.0|This film did not need to be made.  I guess that is my main problem with it.  I wanted to enjoy it, because I loved the classic, but this is a far cry from that.  The original was a dark comedy...this film just made everything too right at the end. <br /> <br />The beginning was also way too drawn out.  Come on, we all know that Charlie eventually gets a golden ticket...let's get on with the story already. <br /> <br />Depp had me laughing at a couple parts and the obsessive sports-mom had a few good lines, but otherwise I was unimpressed.  How about originality out of Hollywood?  Wow, does every film need to be remade?  Can't you people think of anything new?
B000002HK4|5.0|Dream Theater's opening title track to this 1995 release entitled \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" is an incredible thrillride of pure stunning progressive metal virtuosity clocking in at 23 minutes. As I'am listening to this song right now, not a single word can describe how incredible this song really is. The other tracks which include mostly covers of other bands that DT were greatly influenced by are good too, but the title track is definately worth this whole cd alone. James LaBrie's signature vocals just soar throughout here. John Petrucci has awesome guitar riffs and solos that are just breathtaking. This guy is without a doubt one of the absolute best rock/metal guitarists ever, and he's right up there with Dimebag Darrell (R.I.P dear friend), Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Dave Mustaine, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jeff Loomis, Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, James Murphy, Marty Friedman, etc. You've also have great hearable and I DO MEAN HEARABLE bass lines from John Myung, great keyboard melodies and effects from Derek Sherinian, and awesome drumming from Mike Portnoy.

B000301YY8|1.0|just no. <br /> <br />This guy really doesn't have talent for writing songs or lyrics and his voice is is EH. Believe me, vocal talent is not everything. There have been plenty of singer/songwriters and bands with alright  voices, but there really isn't anything to back that up here. His lyrics are trite and the music is sappy and way over produced.  <br /> <br />Although, I can understand that people would enjoy it that haven't heard much music aside from what is played on top 40 radio.

On their mission, they get meet of some of Sullivan's old friends Kaji (Omid Djalili) and Franky (Angelina Jolie). <br /> <br />After a spectacular start with its impressive backlit cinematography and computer generated visuals inspired by \\"Metropolis\\", this film runs of out steam after Polly meets Sky Captain (which is pretty darn early) and crawls from action scene to action scene.  The rudimentary adventure plot quickly disintegrates from too many holes, omissions and convenient escapes.  For example, the journey to Nepal serves absolutely no purpose other than to provide some background on Totenkopf. <br /> <br />Jude Law is an appropriately square-jawed hero, Angelina Jolie provides a surprisingly plummy British accent, but Gwyneth Paltrow lacks the spark to be an enterprising journalist and looks too modern.  Michael Gambon as Polly's editor vanishes after stating some obligatory concerns for his reporter's safety.  Sir Laurence Olivier makes a short digitized appearance as Dr Totenkopf. <br /> <br />Kam-Hung Soh, 23 January 2006. <br />[...]
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A sheer masterpiece.  Easily emerges as the best film of the year!!
B0000039PW|5.0|Can't say enough about this disc. Puffy provides some great production, mainstream but still street with samples from everything from Dr. Dre to Onyx. The only one guest appearance (which is good since only a handful of rappers at the time could match Biggie) is Method Man, who actually murders Big on \\"The What\\". <br /> <br />Standout tracks: Machine Gune Funk, Juicy, Big Poppa, Me & My B****, The What, Suicidal Thoughts
B000002B1M|5.0|Even some hardcore Nas fans sleep on how classic this album is.  True, Illmatic is, and will always be not just Nas' greatest album, but Hip-Hop's greatest album as well.  But with It was Written, Nas displays a creativity that exceeds any other album in the genre.  His story-telling is flawless.  Many sleep on the stories he tells throughout the album: <br /> <br />-2nd verse-The message, with a timeless quotable: A thug changes, and love changes, and best friends become strangers <br />-Of course, the brilliant extended metaphor, I Gave You Power rapped from the perspective of a gun.  Also notice how the skit at the end of Street Dreams leads straight into it.  Brialliant! <br />-last verse-watch Dem Niggaz-I slept on this story until I listened close enough.  \\"The old timers, advise you to the drama that's ahead drama with the feds, not listnening just bobbing your head.  Nas paints pictures with his words. <br />-The Set Up <br />-First verse-Suspect, which I believe is the best story he tells on the album.  I can imagine a movie scene because he paints the picture so vividly. <br /> <br />That only tells half the story though. (no pun intended) The production is top notch.  Nas was laced with beats that match his vocals almost perfectly.   <br /> <br />2.The Message-10/10 Great beat and sick lyrics. \\"1 life, 1 love, 1 king <br />3.Street Dreams-10/10 Classic beat, with the lyrics to match <br />4.I gave You Power-10/10 Classic concept song <br />5.Watch Dem Niggaz-10/10 Slept on classic with mellow beat.  \\"I got no game it's just some b****es understand my story\\" <br />6.Take It In Blood-10/10 Another Classic with scratches on the hook, classic beat and Nas kills it. <br />7.Nas is Coming-9.5/10 Not quite classic only because it seems like filler to me, but hot nontheless.  The hook doesn't do it for me, but the beat and Nas' lyrics are correct <br />8.Affirmative Action-10/10 4 Hot verses from The firm, Nas comes with the best verse, but only because Foxy didn't write her verse.  <br />9.The Set Up-9.5/10 Haoc laces Nas with a nasty beat and kills the hook.  Nas lyrics are there like always. <br />10.Black Girl Lost-10/10 Great message and a great first verse. <br />11.Suspect-20/10 SLEPT ON!!!  CLASSIC!!! HOOK IS FIRE LYRCIS ON ANOTHER LEVEL! BEAT IS PERFECT FOR THE SONG <br />12.Shootouts-9/10 nice song, great hook and beat but Nas flow and words fall just a little bit. <br />13.Live Nigga Rap-10/10 Another Classic collabo wit the Mobb.  Nas murders Mobb like always but Prodigy came nice. <br />14.If I Ruled The Wordl-10/10  Timeless Classic, Nas kicks knowledge with great singing from Ms. Lauryn Hill.   <br /> <br /> <br />
0066620996|1.0|Dear Business Managers and CEOs: <br /> <br />I am here to help you. You might not like what I say because most of you have never taken a proper course on how to do research and how to analyze the results of research. <br /> <br />If you knew better, then you would not be buying this book.  If you doubt what I am saying, pick up a copy of the following journal article: Selection Bias and the Perils of Benchmarking. By: Denrell, Jerker. Harvard Business Review, Apr2005, Vol. 83 Issue 4, pp. 114-119  <br /> <br />It starts off like this: <br /> <br />MANAGERS LEARN BY EXAMPLE. They--and the consultants they pay for advice--study the methods and tactics of successful companies in search of the magic formulas for business prosperity. What could make more sense? <br /> <br />What could be more dangerous. Looking at successful firms can be remarkably misleading. I once listened to a presentation about the attributes of top entrepreneurs. Drawing on a wealth of impressive case studies, the speaker concluded that all of these leaders shared two key traits, which accounted for their success: They persisted, often despite initial failures, and they were able to persuade others to join them. <br /> <br />That sounded reasonable enough to most people in the audience. The only trouble was, the speaker failed to point out that these selfsame traits are necessarily the hallmark of spectacularly unsuccessful entrepreneurs. Think about it: Incurring large losses requires both persistence in the face of failure and the ability to persuade others to pour their money down the drain. <br /> <br />Here's the problem about learning by good example: Anyone who tries to make generalizations about business success by studying existing companies or managers falls into the classic statistical trap of selection bias- that is, of relying on samples that are not representative of the whole population they're studying. So if business researchers study only successful companies, any relationships they infer between management practice and success will be necessarily misleading. <br /> <br />The theoretically correct way to discover what makes a business successful is to look at both thriving and floundering companies. Then business researchers will correctly identify the qualities that separate the successes from the failures. Researchers might conclude- as many have--that the strength of a company's culture is associated with success because many successful companies have strong cultures. But if they were to study bankrupt companies as well, they might find that many of those also had strong cultures. They might then be moved to hypothesize that the nature of a company's culture is at least as important as its intensity and then look more deeply into the whole issue of culture. <br /> <br />Similarly, if we want to examine effective leadership traits, we cannot look only at excellent managers. We must also consider managers who failed to be promoted, were demoted, or were fired. Perhaps their styles of leadership were equally visionary- or humble. Without looking, we cannot tell. <br /> <br />Denrell continues . . .  <br />Cautionary words and counsels of failure, I know, are seldom well received. Managers crave certainties and role models from business literature, and to some extent they have to. They live in a fast-paced world, and they often cannot afford to postpone action until they get better data. But there really is no excuse for ignoring the glaring traps we've described in these pages. Success may be more inspirational, but the inescapable logic of statistics dictates that managers in pursuit of high performance are more likely to attain their goal if they give the stories of their competitors' failures as full a hearing as they currently do the stories of their successes. <br /> <br />So, buy this book at your own risk.  In fact, I hope you realize that it is better not to buy it. <br />
0307236722|5.0|This book is everything I expected it to be - fabulously attractive, great photographs, and delicious recipes.  I was a little worried that Martha would send me off on a wild goose chase for too many arcane and high-priced ingredients, but that has proven not to be the case.  These recipes are straightforward and simple.  The book showcases a wide variety of baked goods, but mostly consists of treats that are reasonably well-known by all.  This is exactly what I needed in my cookbook arsenal, and I can already picture handing it down to my children (who are 3, 2, and 10 months!)so I am jotting my own notes in the margins.  Definitely a keeper.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is one of the best sci fi movies I've ever seen.  I have not even seen the original series...yet I immediately cared about the characters in this movie.  The story and characters are so compelling that I found myself wanting more and more.<br /><br />This is one movie I want to own, not just for the purpose of collecting...but also to show support for this masterpiece.  I hope to see more Firefly movies...  I don't know what will happen, but I'll put my money on them.
B00005JOIF|5.0|Two good, fair movies have been made this year about the eternal Israeli/Palestinian war. I prefer \\"Paradise Now,\\" a tense-low budget, no-stars movie, that portrays two young Palestinian suicide bombers. \\"Munich\\" is about the cycle of revenge and response caused by the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. It's a compelling movie, as unpleasant and uncomfortable as is the subject. <br /> <br />Spielberg portrays an Israeli hit squad that gradually loses its moral certainty as assassination piles on assassination. A key moment in the film is when when a young, idealistic Palestinian terrorist talks of the need of a homeland -- much as Israelis talk -- and the dawning realization on the assassin's leader, Eric Bana, that not much in the way of moral space separates the terrorists from the hit squad. <br /> <br />Unlike others, I did not care for the omnipresent \\"French connection\\" in the movie. One is asked to believe that an old man on a farm seemingly has all the information in the world at hand, including the addresses and bios of Palestinian terrorists. This was a cheap plot trick in my opinion, a quick and easy, but hardly credible way for the hit squad to find terrorists. Better would have been a gritty search, blind alleys, and a mistake or two along the way. <br /> <br />The obvious message of the movie is that violence begets violence and a better way must be found. Spielberg doesn't suggest that better way. I won't bore the reader with my solution, but attempts to look at the Palestinian/Israeli problem in a even-handed manner is a good trend.  <br /> <br />Smallchief  <br /> <br />
B000003B6J|4.0|This cassette was SO popular when it came out- I remember little seven and eight year old kids jamming to it in the Cabrini Green projects of Chicago- they knew every word by heart. They never heard of the \\"Clean\\" version. By the way, isn't the label \\"explicit lyrics\\" and \\"Clean version\\" a contradiction in terms?? How can an album be both at the same time??? Also, how come no one talks about Easy-E dying from AIDS? I guess that is still a taboo subject. Anyway, this album is a precious historical document- and it was a trailblazing expression of the frustrations of Amerikkka's black urban underclass at the time (mid-1980's). Unfortunately, it is also a very SEXIST album that tends to treat all women as HO's. I guess you can't have everything. Public Enemy also came out at about the same time and they were a lot more sophisticated lyrically without the sexist crap.  <br />-DJ Esperanto <br />Chicago, IL
B00005MIJ0|5.0|I think I haven't heard something like this before and I have thousands of Jazz and rock fusion cds from any era. This album it is one of the fews that really blew me away since its first listening. It's melodic content, its inventions are exceptional such as the overall musical value. Its improvisations too even if I'm used to listen to very high level improvisations (from the best Jazz cats). You simply have to listen to \\"Peaches in regalia\\" to be absolutly hooked. It's incredible! It's a sort of small avant garde composition, a sort of small portrait of uncanny beauty! Wow I'm listening to it just know for the ten hundreds thousands time! It's so brilliant, funny, it's ridicolous! Perfect futurama from the sixties!<br /><br />Ok guys I'll begin this review telling you exactly which are the overall best albums from Frank Zappa because I think only a newcomer in the Man's Universe would read Hot rats reviews to know what its all about. Every person who knows Zappa knows and love Hot rats, so the target of this review is you, the one who don't know Zappa (on planet Earth!! .. where have you been? Have you slept all these years? .. just joking ...). Knowing Zappa is something not so easy to do for the newcomer due to the immense discography from the man. But if you want to know immediatly what to buy first ok, you have read the right review. They are, Grand Wazoo, Waka Jawaka and Hot rats (even not in this order or better, buy ALL THE THREE TOGETHER). I'm talking about the best studio albums. And probably the best from a  compositional standpoint. And please be aware that I'm talking about music, not about lyrics or comedy, goofy antics, theatrics or whatever. In this trilogy you'll find some of the VERY best music from the man especially if you're an open minded kind of guy and you are already familiar with different musical stuff, Jazz, psychedelia, rock, progressive, classical. If you already know quite well these \\"materials\\" you will be able to understand what Zappa did with them and to enjoy the deepest his contribution to the music world and the intensity of his music contained here, in the majestic Hot Rats. If you wouldn't like these three albums I frankly doubt that you could love another album from the man. These three are the most brilliant, have the most clever music writing, the best improvisations, the best of the best in the Zappa's Universe. They are instrumental albums and it is self explanatory why they are the best musically. Frank did concentrate on music exclusively and the results are under everyone's ear. Exceptional. Some people say this album is \\"Jazz-rock\\". I don't think so, I don't agree. It is a straight rock album (psychedelic and avant garde at least), this music in the end doesn't swing, it does not have complex chord progressions, people improvise freely mainly on pentatonics not following the chords progressions (not addressing the chords) and the gear used is not classical Jazz stuff (double bass, piano, etc). You have a sort of more or less \\"clear\\" Jazz approach only in \\"The Gumbo variations\\" where the sax has the main role, but nevertheless we're more in a rock-funky field than a Jazz one. Jazz is something else even if the sax player really used here and there a sort of Coltrane alike language. This album has a straight rock beat, I would call it a psychedelic progressive rock album, it's not Jazz. Grand Wazoo is more Jazzier and even Waka jawaka in a sense. But there's NOT BEBOP here. Just to be perfectly clear. Some people use the word \\"Jazz\\" to nobilitate a thing, to say it is intellectual, refined, sophisticated armonically. But it is a wrong use of the term. THIS IS NOT JAZZ, neither Jazz rock. Ok, this said, this album is all these things, but still it's not Jazz, it's not even Jazz rock. I'm saying this to make Jazz mates (I'm one of them) know exactly what they could find here. You would find a brilliant composer, a psychedelic mind, a really creative man, a really clever, dense, passionate, impressive, really avant garde music (avant garde even compared to standards of today in a sense) , but you will not find Jazz here. No swing, no standards chord progressions, no bebop, no substitutions. This album rocks! And it rocks hard! Psyco rock! Brilliantly and completly devastating! I'm a Jazz, bebopcat, but an open minded one and I love to death this album and a lot of other Zappa's albums. Where there's creativity, intelligence, fun, intuitions, passion, art ... I'll be there! You have to be there with me too. Buy at least Hot rats, Wazoo and Waka! Zappa rules! Music is the best.e, impressive, really avant garde music (avant garde even compared to standards of today in a sense) , but you will not find Jazz here. No swing, no standards chord progressions, no bebop, no substitutions. This album rocks! And it rocks hard! Psyco rock! Brilliantly and completly devastating! I'm a Jazz, bebopcat, but an open minded one and I love to death this album and a lot of other Zappa's albums. Where there's creativity, intelligence, fun, intuitions, passion, art ... I'll be there! You have to be there with me too. Buy at least Hot rats, Wazoo and Waka! Zappa rules! Music is the best.
B000A5044C|5.0|Kore-eda's achievement in this film is startling. This is film art grounded in the minimalist traditions of the Ozu school of Japanese filmmaking; leisurely story development, very little camera movement, minimal dialogue, perfectly-pitched performances from the actors. It references much of the best of contemporary Japanese cinema; the abused outcast child seen in Village of Dreams, the rites-of-passage trials in Firefly Dreams, the pagan rituals exhibited in Swallowtail. And yet, added to these elements, is a devastating critique of the anomie afflicting contemporary Japanese society. In recent years we have heard stories of a child found dead in a box in a residential area, a young woman kidnapped and held in a house between the ages of nine and nineteen, children suffocating in a car while their parents play pachinko, and a mother and son who starved to death in the middle of Tokyo because they were too proud to ask for welfare. The film is based on one true story, but I was reminded of all of these stories while viewing. All of these incidents happened in heavily-populated areas, but nobody knew. It is quite a feat that the director manages to indict more than the damaged, neglectful mother; the disinterested neighbours (always shot in an alienating manner, lower-body only or head turned away), the landlord, the utility companies, the convenience store clerks who fail to act. This film fuses social criticism with a beautiful cinematic aesthetic, and it will resonate long beyond the contemporary issues it addresses.
B0000009S3|5.0|This is one of the essential Zappa's records in his enormous discography. Believe me. It's easy for the newcomers in the Zappa's Universe to get lost in it and to lose the essential angles of the Zappa's prism (that is what surely you want to get at first). To me Zappa's best works, the ones that you newcomer absolutly should not lose are Hot Rats, Waka Jawaka, Grand Wazoo. Buy these three studio albums first and you'll go deep inside the heart of this man and of his music. These albus are what Kind of blue stand to Miles Davis or what Abbey road means for the Beatles. Forget for your first purchases all the Zappa's albums based more on lyrics, comedy and goofy things. You'll buy those later, if you fell in love with this trilogy. If you don't like this trilogy I doubt you would like other Zappa's records which often are a little bit confusing, less focused, less brilliant, less perfect than the three works I'm talking about. To the guys who are out there trying to figure out what kind of musician this weird man was (I'm saying musician and composer, not sociologist or guru, or comedian) these three albums can clarify you what kind of original vision of music this man had. Some people here talks about Jazz rock. In the case of Hot rats I would not talk about Jazz rock. i don't know. Grand Wazoo is the jazziest of the trilogy, it has some swinging parts (Eat that question, Blessed relief and Grand Wazoo the title track), not in the Count Basie mood obviously, it's in the Miles Davis-Biches Brew seventies vein .. ... Hot rats instead it is more psychedelic, it has a lot of improvisation sure, but it is not Jazz in the sense that this music doesn't swing. And in terms of instruments only in Gumbo variations you have a sax that dominate the scene and that demonstrate a kind of Coltrane-alike kind of language (and it takes you nearer Jazz even if its not swing here too). But Gumbo is more funk than Jazz in a sense, at least this is what it means to me. You don't have complex improvisation over changes which is the thing in Jazz. Moreover Hot rats has a straight rock beat so it's overall very distant from jazz in my opinion. But this its not something to say that this album is less precious less brilliant than Wazoo or Waka simply because it is \\"less jazz\\". Absolutly not. It is simply brilliant instrumental music that you absolutly have to know if you love art music. If Hot rats is not essentially Jazz, you can bet it is already art for sure! \\"It must be a Camel\\" is another stellar Zappa composition. I mean, the man was so pure as a composer that was able to trascend genres and to create his personal music universe which is expressed the best in these kind of instrumental compositions just as the \\"Camel\\". You wouldn't call it Jazz, neither rock maybe, it's Zappa! This to clarify the definition of the album as a \\"jazz rock\\" output. I would call it a more or less straight rock album, but with Zappa creativity (a sort of big boost!!!!). The fact that it is instrumental doesn't take this album in the \\"jazz field\\" forwhat I am concerned. It is still very rockish, but brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. It will last. Exceptional.plex improvisation over changes which is the thing in Jazz. Moreover Hot rats has a straight rock beat so it's overall very distant from jazz in my opinion.

B000002U9E|4.0|Kate Bush's colorful career is a long and exciting road, with its share of bumps and twists along the way. Her albums are maddeningly uneven and she can casually throw a masterpiece after a 4-minute exhibition of pretense. \\"Hounds of Love' is one of the best moments of that career so far, but it is definetely a characteristic moment as well, including its good and bad. <br />The album is separated in two cycles: Tracks 1-5 (\\"Hounds of Love\\") are mainstream pop/rock material, without any particular connection, whereas Tracks 6-12 are a concept album entitled \\"The Ninth Wave\\".  <br />The first part includes songs that sound accomplished, but, sadly cold. One cannot deny that they are intricate, beautifully constructed and excellent songs, but hardly any of them arouses any kind of emotion. The production sounds terribly dated, all these years later and even though the songs are decent, Bush's vocal sometimes spoils the effect those songs would have had, had she chosen to go for meaning instead of exaggeration and diva attitude. The sole exception is \\"The Big Sky\\" where Bush gets an amazing kick out of being a dreamer. The poetry is thankfully an exception. Most of the songs have soulful, deep and brave lyrics that challenge listeners instead of serving meanings on a plate. <br />However, it is the second part that blows listeners' minds away. It is easily one of the most powerful and courageous albums of any time. 'The Ninth Wave\\" retells the story of a woman trapped -literally or metaphorically- under ice, trying to make her way to the surface. It is an ode to life, it is an ode to believing in the values, in the moments, in the joy, in the gifts offered to us by life. Experimentating with Celtic tunes, choirs, everyday dialogue, drama and difficult subject matter, Kate Bush pulls it off with elegance, grace and emotion. <br />She goes from terrifying, historic flashbacks like \\"Waking the Witch\\", to the astonishing determination of \\"Hello Earth\\" without missing a beat. I feel the need to praise in particular \\"Jig of Life\\", a visionary song on survival. <br />Conceptually, verbally, sonically, \\"The Ninth Wave\\" deserves no less than 5 stars. (and I do not use that rating lightly). <br />Simply said, Kate Bush demonstrates more than anything that when her heart is involved in a project and her mind is free, she can pretty much work musical miracles.    <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|Ok... Lets get the science part of this review over with. <br />The last Ice Age took place a litte over ten (count em') ten <br />thousand years ago.  <br /> It took several hundred years for it to form. And it lasted less than a thousand years. Then the earth warmed up again due to certain geologic changes.(the shifting of the land masses, as well as a slight tilting of the earth's axis.) <br /> Now with that over with, The Day after Tomorrow, is a fun movie to watch. <br /> As long as you can suspend your belief that what took hundreds of years to take place, can happen within a few weeks! <br /> The special effects is the real star of the picture. <br />tornados, tidelwaves, giant huracanes severe drops in temperatures. New York flooded then frozen over. You can't beat <br />it for pure fun! <br /> Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ian Holm are just extras on  <br />the set.  <br />Dennis gives his usual affable guy performance. Jake's performance is somewhat better than it seems. Here he is trying <br />to give his charicter a sense of growth. From a snotty smart kid <br />to a mature young man. Here you get a peek at how good an actor Jake Gyllenhaal will become. (witness Jarhead,and Brokeback Mt.) <br /> While The Day After Tomorrow is not serious science. It is a good way to pass a few empty hours on a lazy weekend.      <br />
B000028U0Y|5.0|There is only one better live album ever recorded than this one and it was CASH's SAN QUENTUIN album, which was the 1969 follow up to this grand masterpiece. Both of the CASH acclaimed \\"prison albums\\" are triumphs in the sense of any kind of genre of music. Loud, fast, and passionate, heartfelt, warm like a glove and cold like a beast. These albums kick MAJOR ACE. Johnny Cash made those prisoners feel like they were human beings, he related to them, and gave them the best perfomances of his career.<br />This album features a fistful of classic recordings such as (one of my all time faves) COCAINE BLUES, a song which was actually written by a Folsom inmate and delivered to Cash shortly before this performance. Cash loved the song and immediatley put it to music with the help of his TENNESSEE THREE. LONG BLACK VEIL is a bone chilling song about true love that will follow you to the grave, ooooh, shivers. BUSTED, one of those short but sweet songs about tough living madness. The set also includes a few numbers with his newly married wife JUNE CARTER including the famous rendition of JACKSON. Also included is the best performance of his classic song FOLSOM PRISON BLUES. This album is timeless, get up, get mad, get down, this album rules the ROOST kids.<br /><br />P.S.. that kid ZAKK, you F'in moron. This album is totally ROCK! To its rawest core. Don't talk about stuff you don't know. You shouldn't be able to go by the name Zakk Wylde if you are going to abuse it. Thank You.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have watched this movie 7 times and would love to watch it again and again. What a lovely picture. Pride and Prejudice has been my favourite novel since I was a teen and to watch the story on screen was a delight. Superb acting by every single actor and actress. Each one was perfect for their roles and very professional, but I would like to point out in particular about Mathew Macfadyen, who gave an outstanding performance and was the perfect Mr.Darcy, tall, handsome, lovely voice, beautiful stride, sexy...etc. He danced so well and the expressions in his eyes conveyed his feelings. Only a very talented and professional actor can do such an excellent job. The story flowed so well and the settings and music was so breathtaking and original. A movie worth watching. Very entertaining, romantic and funny.  <br />
B00005JNTX|4.0|Let me start off by saying, I have never read the books/comics this movie is based on AND I had read all the hype about this movie. WARNING: This is a VERY violent, bloody movie like the ones mentioned in the title.<br /><br />Having seen some trailers and clips on the review shows I kind of knew what to expect. I thought the style was quite interesting, black and white with touches of color. The narrative style reminded me of some of the old private eye radio shows. There were some that had a problem w/the way the women were depicted but I figured a movie called Sin City probably didn't have too many saintly figures, female OR male.<br /><br />The opening vignette was surprising, but probably the only relatively bloodless scenes in the movie. The blood spewing goes up from there. The story is told in several vignettes and the characters overlap into subsequent stories. Let me say the violence is relentless. There were several times during the movie I had to pause it to take a break. About 2/3 of the way through I told my husband I had seen about enough. I listened and glanced at the rest of the movie while cleaning up the kitchen. There were some interesting stories. I did not mind the voice over. I did wonder what the deal was with the Mickey Rourke character that could not seem to die, but you never found out (maybe the books/comics explain this). I just went with it and it did not bother me, just curious about him.<br /><br />I think this kind of movie probably does not require phenomenal acting skills, since the characters are comic-book-like and the stories come off that way too. I very rarely watch violent movies, especially if there is gratuitous, unnecessary violence (Jason movies, HellRaiser), but I can appreciate the stylized, unusual look of the film and the stories vignettes were interesting.

I was truly looking forward to expanded versions on these tales of debauchery. I really appreciate his lyric writing style and had thought it would transfer into his book writing style. It didn't. There was no style. It was the literary equivalent of having a monotone droning in your ear for three days. What could have been great stories of lust and addiction were written so blandly and devoid of any emotion, that they came across like some guy in a tie trying to sell me some extra life insurance.  Do yourself a favor, just stick to their music and read Junky instead. Excerpt as perceived by me: \\"Woke up, did drugs, got laid\\" Repeat. Oh yeah, there was something about starting a band on page 343.
0385512058|1.0|This book appears to have been written by a Deloitte/Accenture/Bearingpoint software called \\"Consultantspeak Generator 7.1\\", generously sprinkled with enough stories to stroke Ferrazzi's ego and make sure that each of his 5,000 friends gets a mention.  I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather that buying it.  Each of Ferrazzi's 'secrets' is in actuality, complete common sense, that anyone with a smidge of social skills over the age of twelve already knows.  Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs.

0307276902|3.0|I was about 2/3 of the way through this book when the controversy hit.<br /><br />It took me almost 100 pages and a month to \\"get into\\" this book.<br /><br />It's hard to figure out at times who is talking etc. and I found myself having to keep back tracking.<br /><br />It did seem a little hard to believe in parts, but the back of the book said memoir/literature, so that seems to cover the author's \\"creativity\\".<br /><br />After reading the book I went to thesmokinggun.com to read the case against him and I was left with the impression that he was a spoiled little frat boy with a drinking and cocaine problem with a big imagination.  I read that he did try to sell this book as fiction first and got turned down 5 times until the last publisher said they would publish it only as a true story.  After a few changes here it is.  So, I think the majority of us would \\"go along\\" with a publisher to get a book we worked so hard on published.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I read this book, but it just wasn't the best.<br /><br />Running With Scissors and Dry by Augusten Burroughs are MUCH, MUCH better and a pleasure to read from page one!!!
B0002DKCMG|4.0|`Eurotrip' is a farce, something you look at and just enjoy. That's it. You may hate the stereotyped images of Europe - soccer hooligans in England or sexy ladies in Amsterdam, well, that is understandable. And people in Italy would most naturally dislike some part of the film, and so are those in Germany, where, according to the film, boys strut at their home like Adolf. I don't say I like everything in the film, but I admit that it has some hilarious moments thanks to the surprisingly good four leading actors. <br /> <br />The four leads are Scott Mechlowicz as nice but \\"predictable\\" guy Scott, Jacob Pitts as perpetually horny guy Cooper, Travis Wester as geeky guy Jamie (with an expensive camera and a travel guidebook), and Michelle Trachtenburg as Jenny, sister of Jamie (and for Cooper she is not a girl). Scott finds that his on-line pen pal was actually a woman, not a male, and decides to fly to Germany. But naturally he cannot go there without lots of misadventures involving his friends. <br /> <br />As you know, `Eurotrip' is like a string of goofy sketches written by three writers Alec Berg, David Mandel, and Jeff Schaffer - all behind `Cat in the Hat.' Oh, but wait, please don't run away. Surely all the ideas are based on silly ideas and the gags themselves are sometimes hit and sometimes miss. The script is untidy but largely enjoyable because of the charms of the likable main characters. These characters are not particularly original, but no one hates the idea of watching Michelle Trachtenbur in bikini, right?  <br /> <br />It is easy to ridicule the film, and call it a Dreamwork's belated attempt to do something like `American Pie' (probably it is), but the cheer and fun are undeniable. And it must be pointed out that before the recent trend of Hollywood's goofy comedies begin, Europe also did many sex comedies that are equally goofy during the 60s and 70s. No matter what we say, the tradition of silly farces would continue, and we keep watching them. Itis what we call guilty pleasure, and I enjoyed it.   <br /> <br />My favorite sketch is `The Robot-fighting in Paris.' You get additional fun from the cameo of Matt Damon, Vinnie Jones, and Joanna Lumley (in the end credit). Awfully silly but fun.
B000002513|5.0|This album was largely underappreciated when it first came out. But the truth is that it improves on Springsteen's first record, \\"Greetings From Asbury Park,\\" in practically every aspect. Bruce's vocals are stronger and more confident. The E Street Band's rhythm section has improved.     This is especially noticeable on funky, upbeat numbers like \\"The E Street Shuffle\\" and \\"Kittys Back\\", where you can vividly imagine the crowd getting into the groove at the bars and clubs the band was likely playing at the time. The slower songs are better as well, for example \\"Sandy\\" blows away \\"Mary Queen of Arkansas\\" - a draggy ballad from the first album.     The lyrics also grew, as the words became less derivative of Dylan and more uniquely Bruce, especially in his ability to convey the beauty and ugliness of life on the Jersey boardwalk. Finally, \\"Rosalita\\" comes roaring through as the best song Bruce had written up this point. Here is all the romance, adventure and courage of youth as Bruce calls out for Rosie to leave her overprotective family and join him on the highway, where they can escape the \\"swamps of Jersey\\" and seek out that \\"pretty little place in Southern California\\" that he dreams of. Of course, this search for freedom and escape is a powerful theme which continues to resonant in Springsteen's future music.    This record also marked a transitional phase, as Bruce began to leave behind the flowery words and experimental sounds to create the tighter, more precise lyrics and music of his later albums. But, for Bruce's \\"glory days\\" on the Jersey shore this record is a highlight.
0312323859|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  After reading \\"Something Borrowed\\", which I enjoyed, I was looking forward to this book.  I wasn't sure I would like it after reading through the first couple chapters.  I felt like I was being put through a review of what happened in book one. But, as the story went on, I realized it was necessary to understand Darcy's character better.  This is a character you really want to hate.  She is so shallow, mean and selfish. The author writes in a way to keep the reader interested in someone I would despise in real life.  I wanted to see what was going to happen in her life. This is a good, talented author.  I will continue to read future books of hers.
1592400876|4.0|Imagine your toughest English teacher with a sense of humor.  Then imagine that teacher wrote a very entertaining book about the importance of punctuation.  If you cannot put those images together, do not worry: the reality is that Lynne Truss is your de facto English teacher and her \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is that book. <br /> <br />Despite her narrow envisioned audience for the book, \\"My book was aimed at the tiny minority of British people `who love punctuation and don't like to see it mucked about with,'\\" this international best-seller has had great mass appeal.  The book was a quick read and it was a good refresher for many punctuation rules, but most of all, it was witty, funny, and I believe a glimpse inside the mind of a type of person most of us never knew existed: a true, die-hard punctuation stickler. <br /> <br />Rather than trying to put into my own words what a true, die-hard punctuation stickler is, I believe Truss described it best in her introduction: \\"Either this will ring bells for you, or it won't.  A printed banner has appeared on the concourse of a petrol station near to where I live.  \\"Come inside,\\" it says, \\"for CD's, VIDEO's, DVD's, and BOOK's\\"...For any true stickler, you see, the sight of the plural word \\"BOOK's\\" with an apostrophe in it will trigger a ghastly private emotional process similar to the stages of bereavement, though greatly accelerated.  First there is shock.  Within seconds, shock gives way to disbelief, disbelief to pain, and pain to anger.  Finally (and this is where the analogy breaks down), anger gives way to a righteous urge to perpetrate an act of criminal damage with the aid of a permanent marker.\\" <br /> <br />Truss' humor throughout the book made reading about the history of the use and abuse of punctuation something I could have never imagined: fun.  If you are adventurous and can adjust to some overtly British references and perspectives without being distracted, I recommend you read this very interesting book.If you do, you may just find yourself doing something you never imagined: voluntarily reading, enjoying, and learning from a book about punctuation.       <br />
B00001QEE7|4.0|If anyone bought the newly released Cinderella DVD last October, some of the trailers depicted Disney movies that were going to be coming out soon. The Little Mermaid was one of the them. It should be out in stores by October 2006. Hope this helps.
B00008QSAA|5.0|\\"Mountain\\". Big.  High.  Lofty.  Rugged.  Beautiful. <br /> <br />All those things describe this band, and I'm not just talking about the 400 pound singer-guitarist Leslie West.  This band sounded big, sounded tough, and sounded thick.  Leslie West had a massive guitar tone and voice, Felix Pappalardi's bass was fat and up-front, and Corky Laing attacked the drums as a powerhouse, not as a finesse drummer.  Throw in Steve Knight on keyboards and you had a prototypical hard rock band from the late 60's/early 70's. <br /> <br />This band offered more, however.  Beyond the huge, rough voice and thunderous guitar of West, Felix Pappalardi added his own mark on this band.  His songs are much more thoughtful and lilting, with his higher voice setting a calmer, more emotional tone to his selections.  <br /> <br />So, we are left with an album that starts with the pulverizing \\"Mississippi Queen\\" leading it off, power chords on top of the Felix/Corky rhythm section bludgeon.  A song for the ages, it just blows you away with its intensity and ferocity.  An FM staple, your kids will know the words to it when they get older, and will instantly know its coming when they hear Corky's cowbell intro.  Who doesn't recognize this classic? <br /> <br />But, the next song is a much more introspective piece.  Jack Bruce's \\"Theme From an Imaginary Western\\" features Knight's keyboards over Felix' vocals.  A song about wagon trains!  Rather than beat you over the head with crushing guitar heroics, it moves you along with the melody and thick production.  A true, emotional classic as well. <br /> <br />The album continues like this.  A West workout followed by a Pappalardi piece.  And it works.  Bi-polar power I called it in another review. <br /> <br />This is a GREAT album by a band almost forgotten today, except for \\"Mississippi Queen\\".  There is not a bad song on it.  This band was good in the studio, great in concert, and this, their first album, is their studio masterpiece.  Not quiteas polished as their later albums, this one just comes at you, raw and rough and bigger than life.
B00005JOQ9|2.0|From the look of the ads on tv I was excited about seeing Hostel. But I have learned that advertisers are very crafty and deceptive people. I didn't realize that half the movie was going to be cheap boob shots and by the time the horror started I was already sick of the uninteresting characters and didn't really care what was going to happen to them. It was all a big tease. Scenes that were supposed to be disturbing were not because they never actually showed anything happening. On a few occasions, yes there was some gore but nothing to write home about. If they had focused more on the human hunting aspect and less on the nude scenes they would of had a better story to tell. It was more annoying than anything else. The first 40 minutes you are waiting for the fun to begin and finally when it happens it's quite anticlimactic. The characters sucked and the story was weak and on top of that it seemed very short. Perhaps an unrated version would be better. Who knows. It just stinks when a movie has the potential to be good but totally lets you down.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|The movie starts out in a West Virginia town where Confederate soldiers are transporting nitro. First problem-West Virginia was a state that separated from Virginia to stay with the Union.  Why would this town be sprawling with Confederate soldiers? Second problem-The Confederate soldier was perhaps the finest fighting soldier in the history of our nation.  The endured forty mile a day marches, went perhaps three to four days without eating a morsel of corn, and constantly fought an army never less than twice their size.  The problem is in this scene seven or eight of our nation's finest fighting men being karate kicked to death by a single x Union Calvary man.  Third problem-General Bloodbath McGraft, wounded at the battle of Chickamonga.  There was no such general.  Forth problem-Jim West riding into Washington with the U.S. capitol dome being worked on in the distance...The capitol dome was completed in 1864, years before this scene was supposed to take place.  Fifth problem-I might as well just mention that every technological marvel in this movie is fake.  In fact, it isn't that these inventions such as the huge spider, the steam powered bike, the DaVinci aircraft, rubber noose, machine gun tank, and the super train were portrayed in the wrong era...they were never invented at any time!  Sixth problem-Gordon says that West should not enter the ball in New Orleans as a free black in a room of \\"southern white x slave holders.\\" Only 6% of the South owned slaves before or during the civil war.  In fact, 90,000 free blacks fought for the South during the civil war.  Seventh problem-the so called movement for Confederates to rise against the Union government historically never happened.  And the eighth problem-was Grant creating the secret service.  The secret service was created by two presidents before Grant.  It started with Lincoln and the Pinkerton Agency.  And the ninth problem is well the whole movie.  If you enjoy a movie as false and unreal as the wizard ofoz or the Little Mermaid then this film is for you.  However, at least the Wizard of Oz and the Little Mermaid do not pretend to be of real historical substance.
0800177177|5.0|This movie almost hits the mark. Its lush and romantic. There are three pieces of eye-candy for the girls (Keanu Reeves in what is probably his worst performance since \\"Ted\\"; Cary Elwes who is good, but miscast; and whats-his-name from the Rocketeer) and one piece for the guys- the super sexy Sadie Frost. (By the by, my father never got over her dying her hair black) but these are not the performances worth watching the movie for.<br />Sir Anthony Hopkins is fantastic in the roll of Van Helsing the genius madman doctor, but its Gary Oldman who carries the movie on his talent. I would have crossed oceans of time for HIM (once apon a time...) This movie was meant to be Winona Ryder's big leap from child rolls into adult rolls. It almost happened. Her performance is good but her affected accent hurts sometimes.<br />Still and all, the soundtrack not to pass over Annie Lennox's \\"Love song for a Vampire\\" is stellar. Sit back sometimes and just listen to the music.<br />Chills.
B00005K3O0|3.0|I wasted my time watching this one. It was pretty entertaining up until the end. The dad was very annoying and the little girl also started to get annoying. The ending was really dumb. I wasted two hours of my time watching this one. The only reason I'm giving the movie three stars instead of one is Anthony Hopkins. I really like him and he is a good actor with a very pleasant accent.
B0002KVULG|5.0|I was thrilled when this came out on DVD! I think this is one of the worst adaptations of the story of Dracula! It is nothing like the Edward Gorey inspired play that made Langella famous in the roll, it is directed by a genious, has a stellar cast, wonderful score (John Williams for pete sake!) but it is all wrong.<br /><br />Why do I love it so? Because it is all wrong. It makes no sense to me, I'm not a \\"goth\\" nut or anything, but I love this movie!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I think this is the best album the Strokes have done. It blows my mind. I have loved and admired Is This It and Room on Fire, both amazing albums, and this work is even better (and that's saying a lot). Lyrically and musically it is so, so strong and I just keep playing it over and over again, unearthing new things on each listen.  <br /> <br />Its sad to say that nowadays its rare to find a group, and an album, that you are just incredibly excited about, for all that it is and what it means to you. This is that album for me and I'm just really grateful for it. So thank you to the Strokes -- you've done something really incredible here.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Okay, so I understand some of the similarities between Theory of a Deadman and Nickelback (Chad Kroeger of Nickelback was responsible for discovering the band). They both are rock bands and they are both from Canada... other than that though, I find them to be different breads. While Nickelback is more of a mainstream hard rock band, Theory of a Deadman is more raw and real. \\"Gasoline\\" shows a great mix of head knockers and ballads. <br /> <br />I saw this band at Edgefest in Dallas on a side stage and was blown away by their power. The guitar riffs and lyrics are full of feeling, and unlike many hard rock bands, you can understand what this band is saying. I find that while of course the rhythm and beat is important to music, that the lyrics give the song meaning. That's why I always have a hard time liking bands where I can't understand the lyrics, although System of a Down is an exception. I don't really understand what they are saying, but their anger comes in how rapidly fast they say their lyrics and how they yell them with almost a growl. <br /> <br />So onto what my favorite songs are... the whole album is pretty solid, but my three favorite cuts are \\"No Surprise,\\" \\"Say Goodbye,\\" and the ballad \\"Hello Lonely.\\" While the first two are hard rocking songs, \\"Hello Lonely\\" is more of a ballad, but yet has a medium rock tone to it. The beat and lyrics make you feel the loneliness that Tyler Connolly is expressing in the song. I love listening to it whenever I'm down. <br /> <br />\\"Gasoline\\" is the second album by this band, and it has received much more radio play time and mainstream status than their initial self-titled album. It's hard these days to find good rock that is raw, real, and that you can jam to. \\"Gasoline\\" shows that bands are very much alive in the fledging genre, including Theory of a Deadman.
6305897786|2.0|Excellent debut<br /><br />The movie starts with a book collector writing a note (which we will never know its content) gets up and hangs himself.<br /><br />The movie continues when a book dealer is hired by a rich book collector, to authenticate a personal copy of a rare occult ancient text, rumored to open the gates of hell, saying that only 3 copies have survived through out the years. The dealer must travel to Europe, examine the other 2 copies and retrieve or verify which is the real version. (the investigated copy was originally owned by the collector who hanged himself in the beginning of this movie)<br /><br />The dealer, worried someone stealing the valuable book, puts it in a safe place at a book shop. The next day, the owner of the book shop is dead (and we will never know why or who killed him).<br /><br />The dealer goes to Europe, examines the books and the owners end up dying as well and their books burned. (again we will not know why)<br /><br />Finally the employer of the dealer burns himself and die as well. (I am not sure why either)<br /><br />I believe the producer needed 5 hours to complete the full script in this movie. Instead he only had 2.<br /><br />Similar, yet much better movies with an excellent script; try \\"The Devil's Advocate\\" and \\"Angel Heart\\".
B000286RNY|5.0|Stephen Chow directs and stars in this powerfully creative comedy and special effects masterpiece. This is the best movie I have seen in years!  <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of the \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\" special effects by any means. Yet in this movie with similar effects I couldnt get enough of it. Mainly due to Stehpen Chow and the excellent writing, casting and directing (Stephen Chow pretty much does it all.) This is a movie that leaves an impression on you due to the fantastic cast and hilarious story. Wich by the way is about a soccer team of misfits put together for revenge and profit. Revenge on the part of the coach of the Shaolin team who is out to get back at his nemesis for past wrong doings. Profit for the ex-Shaolin kung-fu masters down on thier luck.  <br /> <br />I wont say much more about this movie since I couldnt come close to doing it justice. If you like creative and original movies this is a priceless treasure. Mind blowing creativity and all round production. <br /> <br />I would be hard pressed to even think, of anyone, in cinema more talented and refined at making movies than Mr Chow. By making I dont mean just acting in or directing movies just to make a quick Hollywood buck. I mean having creative power all the way from the initial idea to making and putting it on screen.  <br /> <br />Stephen Chow does a lot in this movie and others. He will stand out though for having tons of screen presence and massive charm. This whole cast is as top-notch as it gets. If you like comedy or kung-fu or creativity or epic and imaginary special effect scenes, or all of those things watch this movie!  <br /> <br />I love kung-fu soccer!
0375707972|2.0|Two stars.  Fairly good writing, poor novel. <br /> <br />A compelling part one, a curious look at a dysfunctional relationship, setting up an exploration deeper into the two main characters...one that has no payoff whatsoever.  This is simply a lazily written novel.  If given its due, perhaps twice the heft of the published form, perhaps we could have learned something about Hanna and Michael, but no. <br /> <br />Part 2 is an unfeeling, surface exposition.  Details are employed for episodes unrelated to the characters or their plights. <br /> <br />Michael feels absolutely nothing when he sees Hanna in the courtroom. Utterly inconceivable.  Persistent numbness is not an endearing quality for protagonists.  The build up was great and Schlink gypped the reader.   <br /> <br />Michael: \\"I felt nothing...why could that be?...I've often wondered...hmm, strange.\\"  Not verbatim, but that's the depth of his exploration.  Weak. <br /> <br />All of the episodes that would constitute a novel are passed over as recollection.  When Schlink needs a plot point, he invents a recollection, everything else is forgotten by the narrator.  How many times does the narrator admittedly not recall some detail or another?  That would be fine if all of these blank memories led to a greater understanding of the character, if the reason for his inconsistent recollections was elucidated later in the novel, but it was not. <br /> <br />Schlink scratched the surface everywhere but in the first part.  By the end of the novel I expected Michael to feel nothing in reaction to some event or revelation, I expected him to do nothing in response to the challenges beset upon him (by a lazy novelist), and those expectations were met. <br /> <br />The tiny points of conflict were brush strokes, undeveloped, and reeked of deus ex machina, therefore.  The gentleman who picked him up hitchhiking leapt right into the heart of the conflict, being brash and forthright in a totally unbelievable way.  The same with the survivor at the end of the story.  \\"So you slept with her.\\"  The way Schlink shoved the character right into that degree of confrontation was unbelievable. <br /> <br />It seems that Schlink decided to write short, thumbnail chapters and squeezed the story into that format, rather then letting the story dictate its length and the length of the chapters. <br /> <br />It irks me that such books are touted as exemplary by the Oprah's Book Club brand.  The classics she chooses are indisputable (by and large) and the modern works are all over the map.  The brand on modern literature now reads \\"AVOID!\\" for this and other disparaging experiences, not to mention the Frey debacle.  I think her book club is a good thing only in that it get a lot of people reading literature who might otherwise click on the tube, but I can only hope that some of those people develop a discerning palate for the books they read.  If they read for escape, that's fine, but they are missing out on a great deal of what fiction has to offer.
1400032717|5.0|Although it has been a long time since I read this, I remember it very well and it was great. I recommend this book to everyone I meet who reads on a regular basis. I love the writing - the character development - the way of thinking about things that you ultimately become a part of. <br />This novel is a necessity - and for those of you who may be turned off by the time it takes to get through a book, this isn't very long at all and it's a speedy read thanks to the writing.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Movie musicals are usually dumb anyway but this one takes the cake. The girls are murderers and I didn't like any of them. Watch one of the many classics with Gene Kelly instead.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|I finally got to see KK this weekend. It came down to this for me:<br /><br />-Very long, but not long as in \\"Gosh! This movie took a very long time\\" but as in \\"Is it really necessary to extend scenes for so long, when they are not contributing anything more to the plot? -bottom line, it could have used a LOT more editing.<br /><br />-Storyline: limited and a little all over the place at times. It seems to focus a lot on certain characters (Jack Black's, for instance) at some point, then removes the focus, then brings it back... and in the end I neither hated nor could I particularly identify myself with any of the characters.<br /><br />-Complicating things for the sake of doing it. So many times, while in the island, one gets the inevitable feeling that you are getting tons and tons of obstacles thrown the way of the characters, in an Indiana Jones-meets-Jurassic Park kind of fashion. It gets old after the third or fourth time.<br /><br />All in all, in spite of a couple of places (mostly around the brontosaurus stampede) where there was room for technical improvement, the movie stood out mostly for the effects, and that was about it. Otherwise, it was unnecessarily long and boring at times.
074322454X|5.0|It began when i had to do a book report for AP history i didnt know what book i wanted to read sience i mostly read sci-fi and fantacy. I went to my teacher and asked what book he would recomend, he told me about this book so i went and bought it. after three days of reading i finished and i didnt want it to end. <br />  <br />  Stephen Ambrose was a highly talented author he wrote it so that as you read it you feel as if your right along with them and in this case like your actually one of the members of easy company. <br />   Along with all this he did not require you to have very much prior knowledge about world war 2 he made sure that the reader was kept informed about what events were happening and what was what. <br /> <br />   one of the things that i discovered that made me enjoy the book even more was to discover that the ship that my grandfather was stationed on was mentioned in this book which i found very interesting to see what that shiped played as in the battles that easy was involved with were. <br /> <br />   I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys very human stories or even juist an exciting war book i would give it ten stars if i could.
0385512058|5.0|Author Keith Ferrazzi is a master networker who claims that his Palm Pilot holds the names of 5,000 people who will take his phone calls. That's a powerful claim. Starting as a self-made man of humble origins, Ferrazzi developed his social network by helping people and by developing and mastering the techniques for networking. Here, he shares his methods. His light, engaging and entertaining story will motivate those who want to enhance their social and business friendships. The author advocates generosity as the key to success. That's a radical business concept, but he claims it works. It's certainly worth a try. We recommend this book to people who want to be more social, make friends and expand their business connections. It should also prove invaluable for those who are sick of sitting at home on Saturday nights.

Standouts, in my opinion, are: \\"Oceano\\", \\"Mi Mancherai\\", \\"When You Say You Love Me\\", with my favorite being \\"Si Volvieras A Mi.\\"

0307276902|3.0|This book is evrything a good book should be. Heart wrenching, sweet, pathetic, eye-opening, stomach turning, thrilling, sad, happy, conquering. And the list can go on and on. The only things it IS NOT is what it says it should be -TRUE. It was proven, and James Frey was cross examined. Apparently a \\"memoir\\", most of the most exciting and heart wrenching parts of the book are nothing more than a wild imagination. Publishers would not buy this book as a novel, but later bought it as a \\"memoir\\". But it does not take away from the fact that it is still a good book
0307276902|1.0|I tried reading this book after my girlfriend recommended it to me.  I was enthralled by it at first, because of how shocking the storyline is, but by page 50 my \\"b.s. detector\\" was ringing and by page 100 it was howling so badly that I had to throw the thing down. I just talked to a friend about it who told me that the book is in fact a bunch of lies and that I should check out the thesmokinggun.com.  I cannot believe this guy didn't expect to get caught.  Reading this book for me was like listening to an eight year old boy brag about his adventures as a macho dragon slayer.  James Frey claims he read Don Quixote in prison, maybe what he meant to say is that he is imprisoned in Don Quixote. This guy should be seriously ashamed of himself.  He's right about being a \\"Criminal,\\" (which he capitalize in such a poetic way) but not the cool type of criminal that he wants to be.  He's pathetic and he owes a lot people a lot of money and an explanation. Visit the smoking gun dot com!
B000301YY8|4.0|James Blunt's rise has been a quick one: \\"discovered\\" at SXSW in March, 2003, his debut album was the UK's highest selling album in 2005, easily beating Coldplay for the year's top spot. Even now, closing in on a year since its release, it remains near the top of the UK album charts, and it looks like the US may follow suit as well. Most surprising, Blunt turns out to be more than just a pretty face with a falsetto voice, as he writes or co-writes all the songs, and plays several instruments.<br /><br />\\"Back to Bedlam\\" (10 tracks, 39 min.) brings mostly heartfelt songs on love and friendship, not unlike, say, Damien Rice or David Gray, but with an immediate accessibility not found elsewhere. Mega-hit \\"You're Beautiful\\" (2nd single) proves that point: you've heard it once, and you just can't NOT like it. Better in my book are songs like \\"High\\" (1st single) and, best of all on here, \\"Wisemen\\", with a great dramatic tone to it. In the long instrumental outro of \\"So Long Jimmy\\", there's a nice shout-out to the Doors' \\"Riders on the Storm\\". The last 2 songs of the album deal with Blunt's experiences as a NATO soldier in Kosovo, and in particular \\"No Bravery\\" is quite effective. The only song I really don't like is \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" (3rd single), in which Blunt's voice sounds mostly irritating. The album is helped enormously by the track sequencing and running order (under 40 min.): the music flows by smoothly and before you know it you're at the end of the album.<br /><br />The immediate accessibility of the album bothers me, in the sense that I wonder if I will still like this 20 turns from now, or 2 years from now. But right now, I just like playing this album a lot. Based on the enormous popularity of this album, Blunt can be viewed as \\"the common man's Damien Rice\\", and yes, I call it a musical guilty pleasure.
B00001U0DP|1.0|I'm amazed at how many high marks this movie has been given.  I could tolerate about 30 minutes of it before turning it off.  I felt that the acting was second rate, the actor's line were idiotic and unrealistic, and if my dad talked the way this dad did in the movie to his child, I would have avoided him at all cost if I were the child.   <br /> <br />Just because this tells a story of Jewish people having to deal with Nazi death camps, it doesn't mean it has any real value to it.  Save your money and get something that is more realistic and not as corny as this.
0307263118|5.0|For better or worse, depending on your reading preferences, they just don't make `em like this any more. John Banville's THE SEA, the 2005 Man Booker Award winner, is most certainly not everyone's cup of tea; some might even put him off as bitter medicine whose tortured sentences and exotic phrasings are too difficult to swallow. However, readers who appreciate nice turns of phrase, striking imagery, and multi-layered, deeply thoughtful stories patiently revealed will find much to like in this book. Put another way: those who enjoy writers like the Garcia Marquez of AUTUMN OF THE PATRIARCH or ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE, the Faulknerian Cormac McCarthy of SUTTREE or BLOOD MERIDIAN, the Jose Saramago of THE STONE RAFT or THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS CHRIST, or the David Grossman of SEE: UNDER LOVE, to mention a few, should find rewards aplenty in this short but densely scribed novel. Interestingly, Banville's writing and story-telling style is strikingly similar in many respects to the book that many felt deserved the 2005 Booker Prize - Kazuo Ishiguro's NEVER LET ME GO.     THE SEA is, in essence, an extended elegy narrated by one Max Morden, an aging, self-described dilettante whose wife has recently succumbed to a twelve-month bout with cancer. In response to this loss, Max has returned to live out his remaining years at the seaside resort of his childhood, where he first encountered the Grace family, \\"the gods\\" as he called them. Outwardly, the Graces represent everything that the boy Max and his parents were not - money, sophistication, charm, beauty, and the idyllic family life. Young Max undergoes his first sexual awakenings with the Graces as well, via an idealized infatuation with Mrs. Grace (Connie) that is eventually transferred to daughter Chloe. Years later, the aging Max does not simply return to the resort town, he takes a room in the Grace's former home, the Cedars, now converted into a boarding house. Ms. Vavasour, the matronly landlady of the house, assures Max when he first calls that she does indeed remember him from his childhood days there.     As Banville slowly unwinds his story, we learn that Max has much to rue in his life. He is professionally unaccomplished, a dabbler in the arts who writes about them rather than produce them and who has squandered years researching the painter Bonnard for a barely begun treatise for which Max himself admits he has nothing new to say. He is distant from his daughter Claire and realizes that he has lived a comfortable life from his wife's money (inherited from the ill-gotten gains of her scamming father) without ever having done anything to deserve it. Even his relationship with his late wife is revealed to have been cold and unemotional, more an arrangement than a romance with strong hints of affairs on both their parts. Of course, the crux of Max's emotional torment is his boyhood disillusionment over the Graces. What seems to be nothing more than infatuation transformed into arrested development is ultimately revealed to have been much more, more than enough to have scarred Max for the rest of his life.     Max Morden's character in THE SEA comes across as strikingly ineffectual and oddly effeminate, perhaps a product of his upbringing. He is raised primarily by his mother, surrounded by female Graces during the summertime (Chloe's father Carlo is a hairy clown and her twin brother Myles, he of the webbed feet, is a mentally impaired mute), married to Anna, fathered a daughter Claire, and submits himself to the daily ministrations of Ms. Vavasour (who has her own disturbing connections to the Graces). Surrounded by women throughout his life, Max on two occasions turns vituperative, almost misogynistic, once angrily at his deceased wife and once with the ludicrously-named Vivienne Bun. Here the real Max momentarily appears - powerless, unaccomplished, impotent - metaphorically castrated by the women of his life. \\"I was always a distinct no-one, whose fiercest wish was to be an indistinct someone\\" Max claims in what has to be the world's most ambiguous statement of life goals.    Of course, no discussion of THE SEA is complete without mention of the author's wordsmithing. Whether coloring the world blue as he does throughout, penning phrases like \\"Rooks cawed rawly,\\" \\"rooks in a raucous flock,\\" and \\"the bland packed sand,\\" or torturing his sentences with words like crepitant, refection, jeroboam, convolvulus, scumbling, mephitic, cerements, blench, anabasis, crapulent, flocculent, refulgent, horrent, anaglypta, craquelured, and (my favorite) groynes, Banville is ever one to make you pull up short just to admire his sheer dexterity with the Queen's English. THE SEA, too, tells its own admirable story of loss, on many levels.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When I first bought this album, I limited myself to repeat plays of HUNG UP and I LOVE NEW YORK. But then I started listening to more tracks and now I can say that the best tracks on this album,(in my opinion) are:  <br />                      HUNG UP <br />                      I LOVE NEW YORK <br />                      JUMP <br />                      FORBIDDEN LOVE <br />                      GET TOGETHER <br />                      HOW HIGH <br /> <br />This album is a mix of disco beats, techno, and it definitely also has a strong 80's feel to it.  I can't get enough of this one...
B0007P3582|1.0|this album is HORRIBLE! i hate 50 cent cuz hes not lyrical at all, hes just a pop star who claims to hav street cred that he doesnt have, just watch Stop Snitchin Stop Lyin, and you'll change ur mind. if only i could cuss on here.....  <br /> <br />ps i hate 50 and gunit
B00068CVJ4|5.0|I originally bought this album only for a few tracks.  One of the being:ONE ARMED SCISSOR.  But once it was purchased, I sat down and listened to it...the whole way through.  I found other songs that quickly became favorites for me.  It is rare that I can sit through a whole album, and keep from hitting the SKIP button.  This is one of those albums....Everytime I listen to it I hear new and different things in the background.  This is a album I know I will never tire of.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I thought this was without a doubt the best Sci-Fi movie of 2005.  If you missed it while it was in theaters shame on you!  For those who don't know, this film is based on the well made but short lived FOX series \\"Firefly.\\"      The movie centers on a band of misfits leaving on the edge of society and the law: There is the ship's captain Malcolm Reynolds, who was a soldier on the losing end of a civil war;  His comrade and first mate Zoey and her pilot husband Wash; The Shepherd (preacher) Book who has a mysterious past;  The beautiful Companion Inara, the untrustworthy mercenary Jayne, the ship's doctor Simon and his gifted and disturbed sister River round out the crew.  When River's past catches up with the crew, they are pitted against a nameless, relentless and implacable enemy in the form of the Operative, a agent of the Alliance government whose only mission is to kill River whatever it takes. This leads them over the edge of society and they are forced to find and confront the secret that River holds, and that may be more dangerous than the Operative.    If you have not seen the Firefly series and are a Sci Fi fan, you will enjoy this movie.  If you are already aquainted with the Firefly 'verse, you will probably love this movie.  The special features are also above average, especially the audio commentary by Joss Whedon.  Be sure to look for the easter egg because inside is a delicious Fruity Oaty Bar!    Remember, you cannot stop the signal!
B00006SFLV|5.0|I didn't watch MSCL when it originally aired back in the 90's, as I was only about 11 years old and unable to stay up and watch it... but I remember hearing a lot about it back then.  I only started to watch the episodes a few years back, after renting a few dvd's from the video store.  I only got to watch about 8 episodes, though.  I cannot wait to view the whole series.  I was hooked from the first episode.  The writing is great.  Shows like this just are not made anymore.  I think it's a shame they cancelled it so soon, though.  Imagine how much further they could have taken it, what other ideas they could have come up with!  I love the music in this show, it definitely takes me back to the good ol' 90's.    Great performances from all.  I think (...)is quite expensive for this set, but I know I will still eventually have to break down and get it!  I love this show!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed this series completely when it was on FOX.  I remember seeing the advertisements for it and thinking it looked good, but for some reason I never found it before it was canceled.  I forgot completely about it until about a year ago I saw the DVDs on Amazon and bought them part on a whim and part from the great reviews it has.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This series is awesome.  If this was on TV now there would still be something on worth watching.  If you are a Sci Fi fan you will enjoy this short lived and well made series.  This series has my highest recommendation.
055299703X|4.0|This book's definitely a keeper. Bill, in his self-deprecating & exaggerated humour, makes this an entertaining read. Also, he decorates all the various locations he visits with intriguing historical information (that I love) & he gives enough detail for this to be a a guide book (to some degree, I reckon).
6305744793|4.0|I still remember the hype leading up to the release of this movie back in the early 1990's.  Can anyone forget that Hammer video that MTV played over and over again?  Enough nostalgia for now.  The movie is of course based on the classic TV show about the comically ghoulish Adams family.  This family of witches, freaks and monsters lives in plain view of the real world oblivious to their own oddness.  In fact they just think everyone else is weird, which is what gives them their sweetness.  The movie centers on long lost Uncle Fester (played lovingly by Christopher Loydd) and his reunion with his estranged brother Gomez (Raul Julia) and his family.  This movie is really entertaining and funny, mainly because of the great cast.  Standing out are Angelica Huston as Morticia, a very young Christina Ricci as Wednesday Adams, but especially the late Raul Julia as suave Gomez Adams.  Despite the (comically) freakish nature of the Adams Family this is a very good family movie that young and old can enjoy togther.
B0000028RR|5.0|When I first heard \\"Rage...\\"  I had never heard anything quite like it except that it sounded to me like an intelligent mixture of Black Sabbath, Public Enemy and Led Zeppelin but even then, the originality of the pure hate and rageful vocals got me rivetted.  These guys sounded like they really gave a hoot about the topics of all their tracks and in that way was reminiscent of Punk's the Sex Pistols and The Clash and yet despite all these comparisons, the band still managed to get their own signature sound.  They are also great musicians and to think that all that great sound effects on the cd came just from Morello's guitar!  The rhythm section is extremely tight and the vocalist is excellent.  This is one great hard rock album and the strongest tracks are \\"Killing...\\" and my favourite, made famous by the Matrix soundtrack is \\"Wake Up\\".  Another truly amazing thing about this disc is the production.  Not only are these guys great songwriters and musicians but they produced this album too!  The sound quality is excellent and I can only imagine how great a remastered version would sound.  Still, the sound quality is so good that you don't really need a remastered version.  Excellent tracks, great sound quality, highly recommended!
0553801503|3.0|I just read the first three books in the series within the past year, so I am new to wonderful fantasy world of George R. R. Martin.  I enjoyed all three of the previous volumes and I eagerly awaited \\"A Feast For Crows.\\"  I was aware beforehand of the split in the book so I knew this was going to be half the story.  So what is the verdict? <br /> <br />I enjoyed AFFC but I have to admit it was not the page turner that the previous three were.  About half the book's focus is on Jamie and Cersei.  The other half jumps around to Brienne, events in Dorne, a few chapters on Sansa and Ayra, and most interestingly the Iron Isles.  There is a a fair amount of historical information conveyed and set up for conflicts for what I presume will be book 6 in the series.   <br /> <br />I have to say there is room for some criticism though.  Originally Mr. Martin stated this was going to be a six book series, and right now at what should be the half way point, the story and the cast of charaters seems ever expanding.  Several new POV charaters are added as well as several new supporting charaters.  I liked the complexity and depth of the cast of charaters in the previous books, but at this point I am starting to understand more is not always better.  I am however giving Mr. Martin the benefit of the doubt because this book is in fact half the story he intended and I have high hopes for the next book. <br /> <br />To sum up I have to say I think \\"A Feast for Crows\\" is a big steak, but I hope the next book has the sizzle of the first three.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|For those of us that weren't fortunate to see the original cast of RENT on stage, but grew up loving them on CD, this movie is a healthy fix.  Maybe there could have been \\"better\\" people found, maybe not.  Personally I found Rosiario Dawson's performance as an actor stunning, as a singer a little lacking.  But hey, thats just me.  If you love RENT there is no way you couldn't love this movie.  if you like the move, go see the show on stage...you'll be blown away even more!  I'm just curious to see what show will be next for the big screen.

0671004107|5.0|If you like science fiction that leans heavily on the fiction, then this novel is not for you. There are no Dragons of Pern or Swords of Shanarra. This is the real deal, and provides the most reasonably realistic way for the human race to receive communications, and ultimately, make physical contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. As for the review that put the pu pu on the last chapter...suggesting Sagan was throwing a bone to the religious...I say he was throwing a bone to the ultimate question any thinking being can ask...WHY IS THERE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING?
0307276902|1.0|TRUTH in recovery really DOES matter. As does humility...many alcoholics and addicts like to stand out as the WORST. It's part of the 'delusions of grandeur' that go along with this insidious disease.<br /><br />But the most dangerous part of Mr. Frey's story is that his program for recovery is \\"making a conscious decision\\" to stay sober. His best thinking got him into rehab. If I were him I would NOT trust my brain to make any sort of long-term rational decisions about something so life threatening as addiction. He should have been listening to the lectures instead of playing cards in the back of the room. Most recovering folks don't have the option to go to such a posh place to get sober. He laughs in their face and tells us that their program won't work for him. He's too special.<br /><br />Shame on Mr. Frey for being so irresponsible. Shame on us for making it #1 on the bestseller list.<br /><br />And by the way - I thought his 'one big secret' that he couldn't even write in his 4th step was 'OH so timely' for 2005. His inventory of his childhood badness also seemed worse than his inventory of his using days. Seemed sort of doubtful. If true, he was crying for attention long before he picked up his first drink or drug...he still wanted that attention when he turned on his computer to start writing his 'memoir'.
0736041850|5.0|As I went thru the research Amazon provides to determine whether you want to buy a book or not, I stumbled across the price, $17.95.  After looking at the astronomical prices these big hearted sellers were quoting, I did a quick search to see where I could buy the book outside of the Amazon site and found it, New, at [...] for $19.95 (the 2006 edition).  I think you'll agree it's a far better buy than paying the ...ahem...\\"opportunists\\" selling it here for between $42+ - $199+ for Used books.  I don't blame Amazon for this, just the \\"opportunists\\" (put your own descriptor here instead if you want ;). <br /> <br />This has been your public service announcement for the day.
B0006IF92U|5.0|I have only just discovered this second album from Delta due to lack of PROMO and the fact we only had the ONE single (Out Of The Blue). So when I ordered it I wasn't expecting great things, that's until I heard it. <br /> <br />1) Out Of The Blue - a great track which builds to the excellent ending (so much better than the single version).  <br />2) The Analyst - more poppy track with a frantic piano playing throughout.  This track reminds me of Running Away from Innocent Eyes. <br />3) Mistaken Identity - Again GREAT piano here, and brilliant lyrics all about the cancer ('the girl in the chair with the long golden hair, well that used to be me') It's directness is what makes it. <br />4) Sanctuary - To me this is my least fav track, too simular to Out Of The Blue, but just not as good. <br />5) A Little Too Late - this is Mistaken Identity's version of Innocent Eye's Throw It Away.  Great pop <br />6) Be Strong - This WILL , I repeat WILL make you feel better, 'when your in your darkest hour, hold on and be strong', great words of wisdom Delta. <br />7) Last Night On Earth - now this should have been a single, an amazing love track with great lyrics, if you only download a few tracks I suggest this one and Electric Storm. <br />8) Almost Here - we have all heard this, I like it but it's not the ebst track on here by far. A great duet and single all the same <br />9) Miscommunication - Delta doing JAZZ?! Yes it works for me, it's completely different to anything else but its great, the moody lyrics are fun too 'oh you rub me up the wrong way, yes it was something you didn't say' <br />10) Electric Storm - my fav track on the album, amazing instrumental and great lyrics mean this song differently deserved a music video, unfortunately it won't. <br />11) Extraordinary Day - This is all about the day Deltya found out she had cancer (July 8th). Amazing lyrics really brings a tear to the eye. <br />12) Fragile - this song is saying how we all can feel scared anytime, another ballad with just Delta and the piano (what Delta does best), it's raw and its great. Yet another high point. <br />13) Disorientated - I love this track, it's all about feeling well disorientated basically.  The clocks, the moon, the day, it's a mixed up track which is just fun. Great writing skills Delta. <br />14)You Are My Rock - okay I admit this is slightly boring, a song about how her brother helped her through the cancer, inspirational lyrics, and just Delta with a piano. <br /> <br />Overall the album is probably the best I own, it's a shame it was promoted but hey it's like a little gem for us guys. I give it 10 out of 10 and can't wait for the follow up. <br />Well done Delta you have turned me into a Delta fan!
B000AM1TGC|5.0|This is rightly considered one of the masterpieces of progressive rock. It has the whole spectrum of the genre-- great, unpredictable arrangements (Ace of Wands), esoteric lyrics (The Hermit, Star of Sirius, Shadow of the Hierophant), manic instrumental sections (The Tower Struck Down), astoundingly beautiful moments (Hands of the Priestess), and the drama of classical-like buildups (Shadow of the Hierophant.) In order to perform progrock, you had to have the skills to pull off a wide range of musical moods.   <br /> <br />Three vocalists contribute a variety of styles-- Steve himself delivers a quiet folkish song, Phil Collins his high and airy style, and an operatic approach from soprano Sally Oldfield (sister of Mike Oldfield). Steve's brother John Hackett is superb on flute and ARP synthesizer, while John Acock provides moody keyboard backdrops. Steve himself gives a more restrained performance than you would expect from a lead guitarist let loose on his first solo album, but his allegiance if first and foremost to compositional development, as was the tradition in progrock.  <br /> <br />I'm not much of an audiophile, but I noticed the improvement in this disc immediately. This was one of the first albums I bought on CD, and I was glad to purchase it again for the improved quality. If you want to begin to explore Steve Hackett's career, or just want to relive a peak of the genre, start right here in 1975 when progrock was still one of the most commercially uncompromised genres in the history of popular music.
B00064AM6C|5.0|Before I stopped into the store and picked this album up, I had pretty bunch stopped buying music for six months and was content to listen to the Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and The White Stripes playlist I seemed to have running at the time among many other things, when I bought this Video I had the latter 3 White Stripes albums.  This video changed the direction I was heading musically,  I have since purchased the first two White Stripes albums and many others as this has relit the musical fire that had been smuldering over and not ignited launched into any particular direction.  This DVD has actually changed my life, I have purchased, Robert Johnson, Son House, Charley Patton, as well as all the White Stripes albums as said earlier and am on a musical tear to find out as much as possible as to what developed Jack White into the man he is today.   <br /> <br />    The Concert is one of the most enthralling things I have ever seen in my life. After a couple minutes into it, it becomes truly apparent that you are witness to something very special.  I own quite a few concert DVDs (not bragging,) and this is one I will watch over and over again.  Jack Whites rendition of Dolly Partons \\"Jolene\\" is on par with a performance of Stairway to heaven.  His Dylan covers and every single song he runs through on his 90 minute tear are all five star performances.  I would suggest this DVD to any music fan above almost everything else.  It is an absolute must see, and a must own, that will surely be replayed many times.
B000002UAX|5.0|The \\"White Album\\" came out 5 years before I was born. However, as a kid, I discovered the album buried in my dad's collection, and am glad I did. In my opinion, this is their greatest album. Every song is brilliant (with the exception of the obnoxious \\"Revolution 9\\"). I learned later that this was a rough period for The Beatles, and that they hardly worked together as a band on most of the tracks. Hmmm... interesting to see the circumstances that bring out of the best in people.
0898159156|5.0|I have been interested in CPs for some time, but couldn't keep them alive.  I browsed this book this past summer and now I have a tray of plants outside sleeping (hopefully-either that or they're dead) and a shelf full growing under lights in my closet.  I'm hooked.

B000000LZV|5.0|at a time where practically every single punk rock band of the moment were concentrating on who could go louder, play faster, and who could be the most (ahem)...punk rock. along came The Minutemen; a band of goofy guys who made the most perfect working class music that any intelligent, self-respecting \\"punk rocker\\" could possibly hope to call their own. oy vey. no matter which way yoiu slice it, or how you describe it, the music of The Minutemen remains as profound and sparked with brilliance as when it was first recorded and released upon the unsuspecting masses. elements of jazz, funk, folk, and yes, punk rock...all seemlessly meld into one unclassifiable mass. the sum equals it's parts, and it's beautiful, man.

B0007XT87G|5.0|PORCUPINE TREE has never failed to fully satisfy the pickiest rock listener, and DEADWING surpases even the highest of expectations.  Easily the best CD of 2005, this one rocks with great authority and purpose.  STEVEN WILSON proves yet again that his musical instincts are dead on.  The guy oozes talent.  He and his equallly talented bandmates have made a record rife with great riffs, melodic hooks, and long interludes of sonic splendor.  The song ARRIVING SOMEWHERE BUT NOT HERE is an absolute epic that induces breathlessness.  Every track on the record bristles with a ferocious, desperate electric current that shakes the spine.  PORCUPINE TREE is simply the best rock band you've never heard of, and if you haven't, you're really missing out.  Awesome disc.
0684847817|4.0|Good Faeries Bad Faeries is a book that closely resembles Faeries, the classic book in the field of fantasy art, and is done by Brian Froud, one of the contributors to that fine book. Along with that, Terri Windling did the editing of Good/Bad, and her previous success as an editor surely adds to the power of this book.<br /><br />Good Faeries Bad Faeries is a flip book that separates itself into two categories, the good and the bad side of faeries, thus the title. Each section has its own atmosphere with creatures lavishly painted to reflect their personalities. Unlike Faeries, though, this book doesn't explore the world of these creatures, only the fantastical pixies, sprites, goblins, and imps that inhabit that world. What it does do though and describe the properties of the faeries in this book, and all of the creatures are based on popular myth, so it's very difficult to find something that isn't at least familiar by name.<br /><br />Beyond that, Brian Froud's great style was presented gloriously in this book. Though Alan Lee's contribution to the book Faeries was huge, Brian Froud was the better of the two, at least in my opinion, and it was nice to see what Froud could do on his own. Despite that, the book just isn't original anymore. It was done a long time ago and many times since then. Its saving grace was the illustrator and editor involved.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to fans of fantastical art or those of you who enjoyed Faeries or any other Brian Froud/Alan Lee compilation. It's a solid work of fantasy art that shouldn't be ignored by fans of such things.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Fans of the first Franz Ferdinand release will no doubt be fans of this one. It's nice to hear the band pick up right where they left off, especially with all of the pressure of following up to such a classic debut. It's as if the band recorded two albums worth of material all at once, then split it up into two albums. \\"Do You Want To\\" is the radio hit and a great song. But there are even better songs on the album. The opening 3 tunes certainly keep you rockin', an important element to an album, in my opinion. Then the band delivers the more mellow but stingingly bitter \\"Walk Away\\", one of their best songs yet. If you don't have this disc yet, get it while it's hot!
1400049628|5.0|When you first look at this book you probably think: \\"What?? Zombies? Are you crazy? Don't waste my time.\\" However, I urge you to think of things that could happen in real life. What if there was a hurricane or monstrous earthquake in your town? What if nukes were launched? What if there was a roaring blaze running through the state? Any one of these circumstances could leave you and your family to fight off looters and bandits. The local law enforcement and even military could be off fighting their own battles and not be able to help you if looters came. There may not BE any more military or police. Even if they COULD come to you, between the time they got your call and the time they arrived, you and you family could be dead and you house burned to the ground.  <br /> <br />This guide has VERY practical information, not only to the paranoid type who actually believe that zombies will attack them (remember, this is a HUMOROUS book), but also to people who want to be ready for anything, and even people who believe that someone may be on their way to rob your house at this very moment. This ingenious book is, in almost every way, a basic survival guide that simply has the theme of zombies thrown in to make it fun to read, rather than making you feel like you're learning the calculus of outdoors. <br /> <br />The detail of the guide actually made me VERY paranoid while reading it, and I'm a very skeptical person. I honestly do believe that zombies scientifically COULD exist, though I do not believe that they DO exist. In the event that zombies or looters do come to your town, purchase this book IMMEDIATELY. If you like fiction, or just want something to laugh at, purchase this book IMMEDIATELY. If you hate paranoid people, hate fiction, think zombies are a load of bull, and/or hate Max Brooks (how could you!) then STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK INDEFINETELY! <br /> <br />I hope my perspective on this matter has helped you make a purchasing decision, but please do not make myreview the only one you read. There are likely many more out there that are better than mine.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie will grab you from the opening credits. This is a great, great film about Peter Pan. I've read other reviewers whining about the romantisism between Peter and Wendy but, come on and let's face it, it's always been there and we know that. This movie just brought it more to life than it ever has before. <br /> <br />Tinkerbell had me rolling on the floor. Even though she doesn't talk, she is ten times better than Julia Roberts. (Plus, she's hot :) <br /> <br />ANYWAY! (Kids movie, ahem) <br /> <br />The best and most touching scene of the film (and if you're a big kid at heart, it will make you cry) is the resurrection of Tinkerbell. This was so well done and you really feel like chanting: \\"I do believe in fairies, I do, I do...\\" <br /> <br />The music is phenomenal and the special effects are fantastic. Now, the special effects are not your typical effects you'll see these days in movies. They are good but the style is a mix of storybook and stage. <br /> <br />Captain Hook & Mr. Darling are played by Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy from Harry Potter) and he does a great job as Hook. (I liked him a lot better than Dustin Hoffman) Mr. Smee is hilarious but, he's not quite as good as Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br />Rachel Hurd-Wood plays Wendy and does a fantastic job. John & Michael were good but, they barely had any speaking parts. Jeremy Sumpter plays a perfect Peter Pan and does a great job. Only downside is that he's American while ALL of the other actors are British. But, it is easily overlooked because of the great jobs they all did with their roles. <br /> <br />If you have an imagination, you will love this movie. If you are not a fan of fantasy and have a cold heart, this movie is not recommended. <br /> <br />This is an instant classic. Buy it today. <br /> <br />DVD Downside: Reviewers I've read say that the DVD FORCES you to watch previews for \\"The Cat In The Hat\\" and \\"Two Brothers.\\" This is not true, you may fast forward through them. But still, it sucksthat you can't just hit \\"Next.\\"
B00006LPER|5.0|...who would have thought they could co-exist?  This movie is criticized as being devoid of content, except for it's graphic sexual and violent content.  I would disagree with this viewpoint.  I think of it more as a study of mental illness.  The film is highly unpredictable and very well made.  I loved the music in the film as well.  I personally didn't get the impression the filmmaker was attempting to make any broad-sweeping philosophical statements or moral pronouncements, as its critiques on this website are suggesting.  Its simply a bizarre, somewhat disturbing movie that is very well made and interesting.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Do yourself a favor and make an appointment at REKALL to have the memory of all previous BATMAN films erased from your memory banks.  THIS IS THE BATMAN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.  A dark and gritty fairy tale that is wholly grounded in the real world, this extreemly well written, well acted, and expertly directed tale of a true human icon shines above all in it's field and most in it's medium.  BALE is uncompromising as a tough and realistic Dark Knight.  He is the coolest.  The character tics he gives BRUCE WAYNE and his alter ego are great.  The fact that BATMAN speaks like a pissed off pitbull adds to the realism of why, if you were a criminal, a 6 foot guy in a batsuit would scare the crap out of you.  Every character in this epic is expertly fleshed out and superbly acted by a stellar dream cast.  The second hero in this story is director CHRISTOPHER NOLAN, who brought this masterpiece in early and underbudget.  What a pro.  I went into this flick wondering if it would be boring due to the origin arc.  I was glad to be wrong, this baby is packed with the kind of kinetic action that leaves you panting with an adrenalin enduced high.  The TUMBLER is, simply put, kick ass.  Probably the coolest movie car EVER.  You might think when described as 'a car chase on the rooftops of GOTHAM' that you're in for some real cheesiness.  You're not.  The sequence is down right supercool.  BATMAN BEGINS is the best movie I've experienced in a quite some time and the DVD is a must buy, with great sound and picture, some cool extras and even a comic book to boot.  Great, GREAT movie.
B000002UAX|5.0|People. You would think that Metamorpho, being reflective and all, would have the good sense NOT to put himself under this INTENSE pressure of writing a review on the White Album......but there you go. First off.... I would never even condsider giving this classic album less than 5 stars. In fact, I'd give it even more if it weren't for the limitations of the rating system (which I, good viewer, had NOTHING to do with, I assure you!). But, let's not labor on Metamorpho's reflective concerns. Onwards towards this excellence!<br /><br />  All around, a wonderful effort, even despite the fact that they were not as cohesive a unit as in the early days. Each wrote their song, everyone else was back-up. Regardless... they wisely moved away from the psychedelia of Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour. Why wise? Well.... it's not like those albums were bad, but, really, they proved their point so why keep continuing on that way? This album has less effects and somehow sounds more pure.<br /><br />  In this classic double set, the Beatles truly set out to prove that they can do anything anyone else can do - but they can do better. They out- Beach Boy the Beach Boys with \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", they out-Spike Spike Jones with \\"Wild Honey Pie\\", they out-Jagger Mick's jaggerisms with \\"Why Don't We Do It in The Road?\\", and, for the most part, fill this album with so much diversity up to and including, 1920's dancehall excellence with \\"Honey Pie\\". Not to mention John Lennon's underappreciated but endlessly fascinating \\"Revolution 9\\". Most people find it annoying because of all the sound bits, however, no one ever complained about King Lear at the end of \\"All You Need Is Love\\". So consider this an extension of that.<br /><br />  We have beautiful acoustic songs here - \\"I Will\\", \\"Julia\\" \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", \\"Blackbird\\"-some raw and not so raw rockers - \\"Birthday\\",\\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide etc.\\",\\"Helter Skelter\\",\\"Yer Blues\\", and John Lennon's musings over the Maharishi experience, \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"Sexy Sadie\\". Not only that, but we have the infamous \\"Turn Me On Dead Man\\" from Lennon who also gives us \\"another clue for you all\\". Yes folks.... Metamorpho is STILL looking for all the clues(but don't be mean like some who say Metamorpho hasn't got one! Not nice, people!)<br /><br />  There are just so many enjoyable tunes here that this album is a joy to listen to, over and over again. What a great talent they all were! I would be remiss if I didn't point out George Harrison's excellent \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". It is done here with full ensemble plus some. The real treat for me has to be the demo version included on the Anthology series. Beautiful, understated acoustic guitar with extra lyrics. It is a transcendence I wholeheartedly recommend!<br /><br />  In closing -- as unfortunate as it may have been - this album, as excellent as it is, left behind a disturbing legacy with the Charlie Manson murders the next year. His crazy mind thought the Beatles were the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and that their music (i.e; \\"Piggies\\" etc.) spoke to him and told him to murder. Well people, Metamorpho must wax philosophical here - the world, unfortunately, is never free of madmen. And I won't get into all the grief that idiot caused 25 years ago with John Lennon. However... that said.....this is truly a most worthy \\"Classic\\" and should be in any serious music collection. Metamorpho has deemed it so - so it must be so! (O.K. - I get carried away) but it is superb. Get it! Later--- Light and Truth and Beatles..........Metamorphoshi experience, \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"Sexy Sadie\\". Not only that, but we have the infamous \\"Turn Me On Dead Man\\" from Lennon who also gives us \\"another clue for you all\\". Yes folks....

B000002UB6|3.0|Although a fine album, you can definitely hear the fat lady singing. OK, not literally of course, but \\"Let It Be\\" surely marks the end of a phenomenal era of rock music. The boys here were making an attempt to return to their roots, possibly to save what seemed to be the inevitable end of the band. For an even more complete account of what was happening, I recommend that in-studio documentary movie \\"Let It Be\\". This, of course, offers the historic rooftop concert.
0380789035|4.0|This book surprised me!  I was not expecting the strong (at times) sexual references.  This book was my second by Gaiman (first being Neverwhere) and I continue to be impressed by his unsurpassed creative mind.  I have never heard a tale quite like this!  Although in the end you find it *very familiar.*<br /><br />I am usually not one for books that confuse or seem to not connect throughout, but this book kept me reading.  I have to admit the stories about the gods went on far too long at times and most it did not amount to much.  In the end I feel the story could have still come together minus a lot of those tales.<br /><br />This book had some really great twists that I did not expect.<br /><br />The end was a big surprise.<br /><br />In conclusion, I find myself perplexed by it all, but I'm pretty sure that was the point Gaiman was trying to get across!<br /><br />Definitely gets you thinking.  Very unique!  I would recommend and I'm glad that I read this title.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was never able to get into this show when it was originally aired.  I think it's because Fox stupidly showed the episodes out of order.  If they had started with the pilot episode (which somehow ended up being the last episode aired before cancellation), I'm sure more people would have gotten hooked.  Anyway, I recently bought the DVD set and the movie (Serenity), and watched the entire series in less than a week.  Wow!  Now I see what the fuss is about.  This is the second best sci-fi series to hit the airwaves in the last 10 years, maybe ever.  Only the new Battlestar Galactica ranks higher, in my opinion, and it's a close call.  If you're on the fence about buying this dvd set, stop hesitating!  Buy it right now and enjoy this wonderful show!
B000A88EV4|4.0|I highly enjoyed this movie...enough to fork over $40 for a copy of it.  It takes multiple viewings to understand the complex characters (and to interpret the heavy british accents).  Bold filmmaking, very stimulating.  There is a lot of dialogue..this is not a plot-driven film, it is more of a character study.  It's not a \\"happy movie\\"...some accuse it of misogynist overtones...some may describe it as nihlistic (I do not).  I describe it as thought-provoking and unique.  Hopefully you can find a copy of it cheaper than $40 however.  I do not think the extras warrant the excessive price of the movie, and I only paid it due to the fact no rental store in my area carried it.
B00008EUMA|5.0|Got this one the day it originally came out. Re-bought it well over 3 times. Had the CD before I even had a CD player. I don't care what people say about Dave mustaine. In my opinion Megadeth has always been a better band and not a sell out. Maybe if Lars would listen to this he might be able to come up with some good ideas to make good songs like he use to. Sorry Lars but thanks for the first 5 full length studio albums I still enjoy them. OOOPPP!!! This a Rust In Peace review. This is absolutely on the top 10 metal albums ever made. Great song writing Marty's Debut with the band,great solos. Guitar solos are not out of fashion, a song is not complete without one. If you're a true metal fan you MUST OWN THIS!!!!!
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|This is total(place imaginative word here)! Where is the movie? I ordered it before it was to come out in 2006 and now it says 2010! Thats NOT what I ordered. Who orders a movie 4 YEARS BEFORE ITS PUT OUT!? No one! Thats why it is incredibly stupid that they pushed it back! I urge others who ordered it to write and ask whats going on. Dont order this movie from Amazon because you could probly find it out EARLIER somewhere else!
B00005JOQ9|4.0|Even if the previews for this movie looked terrible and even if the movie didn't have tons of hype backing it up (stories of people getting sick and passing out in theaters) and even if it didn't have Quentin Tarantino's name plastered all over it, I still would have seen \\"Hostel.\\" Why? Writer/director, Eli Roth, won me over with his first flick, \\"Cabin Fever,\\" which definitely had a style all it's own and I've been dying to see what he would come up with next. Afterall, the guy's got just as sick of taste in horror as he does in humor. Needless to say, if you go into \\"Hostel\\" knowing what kind of movie you are seeing, you really won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The previews make this movie look like an extremely graphic, intense flick where people are being tortured for 90 minutes. I'll admit, I bought into it and sat down in the theater prepared to have my usually strong stomach put to the test. However, this isn't that flick. Just like \\"Cabin Fever\\" was misrepresented and therefore, misunderstood back in 2003, due to a poor advertising campaign, so is \\"Hostel.\\" Judging by most negative reviews, it seems people went into it under the inlfuence of the ads, which seem to promise a bloodfest. Not to say this movie is wimpy, as it has it's share of gore, but it's not as brutal and unrelenting as it looked like. Eli Roth brings his own flavor once again to this movie, and just like Cabin Fever, it's one of those movies that you never quite know what to expect. Injected throughout are sprinkles of Roth's signature sense of humor, but unlike \\"Cabin Fever,\\" the movie doesn't end in one big punchline involving rifles. The cast, led by the superb Jay Hernandez (who makes his role as human and realistic as possible) is perfect for this movie, and the European setting alone is intriguing enough to sit through this movie for, if not for the bounty of bare breasts (this movie must hold the record).<br /><br />So, when you consider the wasteland that is Winter movies (\\"Big Momma's  House 2,\\" anyone?), \\"Hostel\\" is the oasis in it all. Here you will find a movie that is interesting, original, makes you think, and entertains all your senses at once. As Roth's second film, it's a winner. Obviously it has it's flaws, but such can be forgiven. As by the time you walk out the theater, you will be wondering what you would do in this situation, or if things like this really go on in the world. You've been warned: Don't go in expecting carnage. It's just a unique, slightly bent horror flick, the kind that only Eli Roth could deliver.Momma's  House 2,\\" anyone?), \\"Hostel\\" is the oasis in it all.

B0007OCG56|1.0|The only good thing that made this movie worth sitting through was Adam Sandler and Cloris Leachmen.HORRIBLE.  I finished watching the movie and was like \\"what? is this it?  It was not worth my time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've never been attached to a TV show since I was much, much younger.  I don't even like TV. <br /> <br />After watching Firefly, I like TV even less. <br /> <br />In November of 2005, I went to see a movie called \\"Serenity\\" in a nearly abandonned movie theater.  The ceiling was missing in great chunks, the seats were falling apart and there was a total of 7 tickets sold that evening.  But this was the only theater left in the state showing \\"Serenity,\\" and something told me I HAD to see it.  Not far into the movie, I forgot all about the strange condition the theater was in.  I was hooked.  By the time the movie ended, I was obsessed. <br /> <br />So of course, the next logical step was to check out Firefly, the show the movie was based on.  I found the show to be even better than the movie (affectionatly called the \\"Big Damn Movie\\" by fans).  There isn't a bad episode in the 14 in the series.  Some episodes are better than others, but it all depends on your personal tastes.  Some episodes will have you rolling on the floor with laughter, others will move you to tears.  And you will get no closure.  The only was to describe the way I felt after I finished watching \\"Objects In Space,\\" the last episode in the collection, was heartbroken. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt, the finest television show I've ever watched.  But like I said, I don't watch much TV.  But I do love science fiction, and I can tell you this is of the highest calibur.  The characters are funny, moving, flawed, complicated, and ultimately human.  Joss Whedon has created a realistic vision of the future.  There are no aliens, no hyperspace jumps.  There are lasers, but those are for rich folk.  He's taken space being the final frontier to a more literal meaning by filling it with frontiersman. <br /> <br />The production values, for the most part, are very good.  From time to time, there will be something that looks low budget, but these moments are rare.  And the cast...where to begin...just about flawless.  From the first episode, one might think the cast has been working together for many years.  They are the show's greatest strength, with the writing being a close second. <br /> <br />I can't stress enough just how good this show was.  I've shown it to pretty much everyone I know, and there hasn't been anyone who hasn't fallen in love with it.  You don't need to be a fan of the science fiction genre to like it.  This is a show about the working class.  The characters strive to just continue.  To keep flyin'.  The going gets rough sometimes, but if they're all together at the end of the day, in the freedom of their ship, it's just enough.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I'm not a professional reviewer, or even a polished amateur, and I'm really biased toward Yes in general.  Yet the price of admission to this concert is justified by a single, brief track that is pure inspiration.  \\"My Eyes\\" is fun, it's great Yes and it'd be great to hear a full-length version of the song done with the tonal textures, the rythmic bounce and the ephemeral eerieness used in this flash of musical brilliance.  And the spirit conveyed by the band when they performed this piece is subtly gleeful, in my opinion.  I've gone back and listened to the full version on Keystudio.  The depth of Yes' craft is inestimable.  Buy the DVD?  Buy the DVD.  Watch \\"My Eyes\\" over and over.
B000001EL3|4.0|\\"Destroyer\\" was Kiss' fourth studio album and they had just achieved enormous success with their double live album.  So instead of going back into the studio to create another typical album, they decided to go in another direction.  They hired Bob Ezrin, who at that time was known only for working with Alice Cooper.  Ezrin's unique vision provided Kiss with some great songs, but some of the songs are downright bad and the production is a bit over the top for Kiss's music.  <br /> <br />1. Detroit Rock City-5/5.  One of Paul's best songs and one of the best Kiss songs ever.  This one rocks very hard.  The lyrics, vocals, music, and solos are all damn near perfect.  Excellent song. <br />2. King of the Night Time World-3/5.  This song is very weak for Kiss.  Paul sings it and he wrote some of the lyrics, but this was mostly an outside song that Ezrin brought in.  It isn't terrible, but it isn't great either.  The vocals are flat and the music is boring with too much production. <br />3. God of Thunder-5/5.  Written by Paul and sung by Gene, this is a Kiss Klassic.  Very heavy and dark.  Lyrics are perfect and Gene sings it perfectly.  Great solo by Ace. <br />4. Great Expectations-2/5.  Oh, boy, where to begin? This is hands down one of the absolute worst Kiss songs ever.  This has Bob Ezrin written all over it.  The lyrics are stupid and the vocals are flat.  And I don't care how much people think that bands should branch out and experiment, there is no reason whatsoever for a Kiss song to have a boys' choir on it.  Awful. <br />5. Flaming Youth-3/5.  Another weak song.  This one is Paul's.  He sings it well, but the lyrics are kinda dumb and the solo, not performed by Ace, is terrible.  Not because Ace doesn't play it, but because it just doesn't fit.  Not too great. <br />6. Sweet Pain-2/5.  Another bad song from Gene.  The lyrics and vocals are bad and the music leaves a lot to be desired.  The rhythm is doubled with an acoustic guitar and sounds awful.  The female background vocals are too much and the song is overproduced. <br />7. Shout It Out Loud-5/5.  Another attempt at producing a great party anthem similar to \\"Rock and Roll All Nite.\\"  I actually like this song better.  It has more energy and the lyrics are great.  Paul and Gene trade lines back and forth and it works very well. <br />8. Beth-5/5.  Beautiful ballad from Peter that became, at that time, Kiss' biggest hit single.  Peter's vocals are absolutely perfect.  The piano is played beautifully and the lyrics are great. <br />9. Do You Love Me-4/5.  Another outside song that Ezrin brought in by the same people who wrote \\"King...\\"  This one is considerably better.  The lyrics fit Paul perfectly and the vocals and music are great. <br /> <br />People who think Kiss is a big, loud, dumb, talentless rock band seem to love this album.  Those of us who live and die by Kiss tend to think that it is weak and overproduced.  Thank God Kiss abandoned this sound for their next two albums.  It just takes some getting use to, but it could have been a lot better.
B0000027K7|5.0|Climbing! by Mountain is a true rock classic. Every song is great, and Leslie West's guitar playing is AMAZING. He can say more with a couple of notes than most players can in an entire solo! No doubt about it, Leslie is a MASTER of the guitar! Pick up this cd if you love hard rock and great musicianship!
B00005JOFO|5.0|A lot's been said here and I don't need to repeat it. Best movie ever - yes! <br /> <br />One thing I'd add - the material in this movie is incredibly compressed, like really good poetry. And also, like good poetry, it gives away more and more and more upon successive viewings. <br /> <br />See this movie more than once. MANY TIMES more than once! <br />
0671015206|5.0|This is a wonderful book that tells Americans that are determined to live a life of consumerism and throw their old age on the mercy of social security the hard truth that they need to hear. What is so great about this book is that it gives advice that anyone can follow, and through the author's survey of millionaires he shows that just about anyone can build wealth and live financially secure.<br />The author separates people into two groups - prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAW's) and under accumulators of wealth (UAW's). He notes that the PAW's tend to believe in their own abilities and do not believe that a modest family background holds you back, live below their means and invest an average of 20% of their household income, never purchase on impulse, and realize that you are not what you drive. 90% of the PAW's do not believe that they will ever inherit a dime and are generally right, and their spouses tend to share their frugal habits. The author makes the observation that a household divided in financial orientation is unlikely to accumulate wealth. 80% of the wealth accumulators are college educated, but never attended a private school. They intend to finance the college educations of their children, since they are big believers in the importance of education, and consider it a worthwhile investment. The author compares this to the under-accumulator, who may have a high income but spends his time worrying about his financial future rather than doing anything about it. The under-accumulator believes that wealth means showing off via high-profile possessions versus investment.<br />This book is a breath of fresh air compared to other wealth-building books I have read that encourage the reader to take big financial risks in entrepreneurial endeavors that they may not fully understand versus taking the simple steps outlined here that can lead to big returns but take time, patience, and most of all a realignment in your attitude toward money. Highly recommended.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|This review is about the discs themselves and not the movie. So what exactly are on these 2 DVDs? The answer: not a whole lot. In fact, this edition is shockingly devoid of content.. a real disappointment considering how great some other 2-disc sets are.<br /><br />The first disc is only the movie. No audio commentary, nothing, so why even put a \\"Special Features\\" item on the menu screen? Selecting it tells you to see Disc 2. I realize this is a long movie (over 2 hours), so space was an issue here, but the studio could've squeezed in an audio commentary track. It doesn't take that much space. Director/actor commentaries are par for the course these days and a lot of people enjoy listening to them and consider them essential to a DVD purchase. Instead, we have a French dubbed track.. and we all know how people love dubs, and French, no less.<br /><br />The second disc is appallingly miserly in content: three 10-15 minute production featurettes, a 3-D gallery of the gods (who cares about bad 3D?) which are about 5 minutes each god, and subtitles. That's it! End of story. All in all, that's less than 1 hour of content. The featurettes are mildly interesting, but are too short and left me wanting more. That's the reason I and a whole lot of people buy these DVD 2 disc sets: to see the behind the scenes stuff and details about the film making process.<br /><br />Other historically based movie DVD's like Kingdom of Heaven and Last Samurai pack a lot of content in and you get a lot for your money. Not here. The second disc is virtually useless. Yet another lazy DVD put out by a studio seeking to cut corners. Don't reward lazy studios. Heaven is a much better movie and has a lot of overlap with this one (some of the same actors: Bloom, Gleeson), huge epic battle scenes.. plus it's a Ridley Scott film, and the DVD is packed with features.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Movies that state that they are based on true stories always intrigue me.  Especially when their subjects are similar to that of The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  Being Christian, I believe in God, the Devil, spirits and demons, etc.   I believe it is possible for people to become possessed by demons. <br /> <br />That said, I'll continue on with my review of this movie.  I'm not familiar with the true story on which this movie is based, so I don't know what of the movie is fact and what of the movie has been exaggerated in typical Hollywood style.  Regardless of this, I found the whole movie to be very believable and when I'm able, I plan to do some research to find out just what the facts are surround this case. <br /> <br />If you have an open mind about things such as this, you should see the movie.  It's not a movie that keeps you guessing, as everything is revealed exactly when it should be.  There are moments when I got the tingles, but that's probably only because I believe in the subject matter. <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|Someone below mentioned Jesus of Suburbia reminds them a little too much of Summer of '69 by Bryan Adams.  I haven't purchased the CD, so I don't know.  I do hear Holiday on the radio a lot though, and I love it.  But it's totally reworked Iggy Pop with new lyrics.  If Holiday is The Passenger by Iggy Pop, and Jesus of Suburbia is Summer of '69, how much of this besides the lyrics is really original? <br /> <br />It's still a great song though, and I'll buy the album anyway when I have the spare cash.
1592220053|5.0|I asked Martin if he was ever going to write more and he said, then, that he was too busy with Wild Cards.  Well, George, Wild Cards are OVER, we want more TUF!!!!!  And cats, some how, even with fixing all my cats I'm following Tuf in numbers.
6305313687|5.0|Derrik (Norton) has just returned home from serving his prison sentince for manslaughter to find his brother Danny (Furlong) has followed his example and is neo-naxi supreme.  He should be so proud, but alas, if theres one thing that prison has tought him it's that he was there for a reason...he was wrong.  This film has so much heart and soul it's a shame that there are still those who don't see it for what it really is.  You have a man who knows only one way to feel, and due to experiences in his life he feels he is justified, and throughout the movie, while listening to Derrik rant and rave you will start to see where he's coming from.  It may be scary to admitt, but then again it's not when you see the life he lived and the adverse effects childhood trauma can have on someone, regardless of rights and wrongs.  It's like when a man, abused relentlessly by his father turns around and abuses another child.  There's no justifying the crime, it's WRONG, but you can start to break down the reason's as to why.  That's what this film does, it breaks down the reasons as to WHY there is so much hate today and why people feel the way they do.  The key to this film is that you can't blame the world for what one person has done...and you can't blame a race for the jack@$$ decitions of a few.  Derrik realizes this after spending his time in prison, realizing that there is good and bad in all races, even whites, and that you can't hold a nametag over the heads of every minority you see just because the ones you know are @$$holes...It's a timely lession because we all do it.  Stereotypes are so common that he blacks will make comments in regards to there own stereotypes and whites will do the same.  We all cast judgment because of a few instances and thus make it harder for each coming generation to make there own choice as to how to feel.  We are molding our youths to feel the hatred we keep inside by the comments we make under our breath or the jokes we make when in mixed company.  EVERYONE does it, but what this movie does so well at showing is the HORRID outcome that can happen if we don't learn as a society to accept one another.  We should not hate a race but hate an action.  Don't hate every african-american because the ones on your street seel crack and gang beat your brother...don't hate whites because your brother was harrased at school by the class racist...There is good in bad in every race, culture, religion...you name it it's there...but the bottom line is that with the bad there is the good and we as humans only have to dig so far before we find it.  Edward Norton deserved that oscar hands down, no if ands or buts because with his POWERHOUSE of a performance he made me a beliver...a beliver in the fact that anyone can change what they feel and with enough effort and love we can make a differnce in the lives we effect!
0060254920|5.0|As I'd already indicated The basic bottomline premise of this book is that when Max is punished & sent to his room without supper but then still as a result of it he still manages to make the most of his punishment via first turning his bedroom into a forest & then after doing so walks through the forest & to a sailboat of which he boards to sail away to the island where he gets to be king of the wild things only in conclusion to have learned his lesson & wants to give up being king of the wild things as well return to his homelife.
006054094X|3.0|Mr. Menzies has accumulated an amazing catalog of information, but without sufficient backup.  He has entered an arena quite different from the one he excelled in, navigating a submarine for the Royal Navy.  In an effort to overwhelm his readers with an avalanche of data, he brings too much and verifies too little.  His scholarship is inconsistent, to say the least.  For example, he throws in that the Mexican museum at Teotihuacan has Chinese artifacts without even telling the readers what they might be, let alone provide a picture or a footnote.  He apparently did not know that this pre-Columbian city-state was abandoned some six hundred years before the time of Zheng He. <br /> <br />He does offer tantalizing hints at scholarship in other countries that presumably can substantiate at least some of what he claims.  Unfortunately he did not include this in his fascinating book.  He does provide one great service: his book is the best single source of rare maps from the Age of Discovery I have seen.  Zheng He and his voyages in the 1420s is real, the Piri Reis map is real, and the sudden attempt to close China off from the rest of the world did happen.  We are missing reams of questions and volumes of answers, but Mr. Menzies has taken a bold venture into the unknown.  I think he hit a reef.

ARRGGGHHH!!!!
B00003CWL6|5.0|This film touches the soul, deep and refreshing while at the same time detrimental and heartbreaking.  This film follows Lester (Spacey) as he retells the events leading up to his untimly death.  The heart and soul of this film is that all that makes Lester happy eventually kills him.  Lester is hitting his mid-life crisis.  He's got a bad marriage (his wife played by Benning) and a bad relationship with his daughter played by Thora Birch.  He hates his job and hates his boss and pretty much hates his life in general.  Now he gets new neighbors...neighbors that bring both newfound life and eventual death.  His neighbors son is a pot smoking, pot selling teenager obsessing about Lester as well as his teenage daughter...he sells pot to Lester and has sex with his daughter.  Lester quits his job and starts working at a burger place...fantisizes about his daughters cheerleader friend who is in turn fantisizing about him...he starts working out, getting in shape...He's trying to recapture his youth...the days when he was happy with where his life was headed and didn't feel so trapped in a dead end marriage in this black hole that leads him nowhere but around and around and around...He's tired of being miserable.  I wished him the best but you know it can't last when he tells you in the beginning that he's dead.  Spacey, Benning and Birch are all brilliant in there roles, but it's Spacey who steals the show with his perfect portrayal of the 40 somthing man with nothing left to live for.  This is the man we could all be one day.  It's as depressing as it is beautiful.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Now, I have read a lot of the other reviews, and I can appreciate the opinions expressed there. However, I cannot---for even a second---agree that this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is better than the 1995 one. Be that as it may, I did actually like this one for some small things like:<br /><br />1. The scene where Darcy hands Elizabeth into the carriage as she and Jane are leaving Netherfield, and, as he walks away, he has to flex his hand because he can still feel the heat of her touching him. (Very sexy).<br /><br />2. The proposal in the rain, and the sensual, deep look on Darcy's face when she told him no. (Also very sexy).<br /><br />However, these two things do not make up for the SUPREME lack of historical homework done by the writers, producers, costumers, director, etc when coming up with some of these scenes. Knowing as much about the time period as I do, it took me out of the story when scenes would pop up that I know could not have occurred EVER. When you take away the realism of a story, you lose me. Here are a few of the glaring examples:<br /><br />1. Miss Bingley's dress at the Netherfield ball. It looked more like spaghetti straps than an actual ball gown is supposed to look during this time. It is so not historically acurate and I had a hard time not being shocked by it long enough to pay attention what was going on with the story.<br /><br />2. Elizabeth showing up at Netherfield with her hair down around her shoulders. It would not happen, and Elizabeth (the character) would have been mortified to be seen so (especially by people she detested).<br /><br />3. Mr. Bingley coming into Jane's bedroom at Netherfield. I don't care if she was on the verge of dying that very minute, it would never happen.<br /><br />4. Mr. Bennett apologizing and consoling a crying Mary after he ordered her to stop \\"exhibiting\\" on the piano. This is a serious breach of the character for him. The essence (and fun) of Mr. Bennett is that he is detached (emotionally and usually physically) from his family (except at times from Jane and Elizabeth). He laughs at his wife and younger daughters' opinions, attitudes, and actions because he knows they will always be silly no matter what and it is better laugh and get some entertainment out of it than to get angry over something he can't change. He does not apologize for his actions or caustic words. He just doesn't. Even when Lydia runs off with Wickham, his saddness over his inabilities as a father lasts for about a minute and, by the end of the book, he is back to his old self. He does not apologize. He just doesn't.<br /><br />4. Lady Catherine showing up to confront Elizabeth at night, and Elizabeth (as well as her entire family) receiving her in their nightclothes. Again, none of these things would happen. Not only are both of these things severe breaches of etiquette, but they also are large steps out of character for all involved. (Think of Robin Hood---dressed in MC Hammer's pants---robbing the rich to keep it all for himself. It simply wouldn't happen.)<br /><br />5. Elizabeth walking outside (at the end of the movie) in the dawn in her nightgown. Again, a large breach of etiquette. Elizabeth---no matter how tormented she was about Darcy---would have dressed even before going downstairs, much less outside. Not only would Elizabeth have been embarrassed to find herself this way when she sees Darcy striding over in the distance, but Darcy would have been shocked to see her that way as well.<br /><br />6. Darcy just walking over to her house at the end. Not only is it way too early in the morning for him to be calling, but he comes over partially dressed (with no cravat). Now, let us keep in mind people that this is the staunchest, most prideful, proper character in the history of literature. I don't care how in love he is, he is not going to show up at the house of the woman he adores without getting fully dressed first. Again, it just isn't going to happen.<br /><br />And I wishI could say this is all. Believe me, it isn't, but to put every issue I have on here would take me 12 hours, and I have better things to do. Only know that there are soooo many more. The point is that I do not have a problem with them leaving characters out, shortening the story, leaving out storylines, flattening down characters, etc. But, I cannot buy into a story that cannot be mostly accurate. It would be like watching \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and having a scene with the Indians stopping in the middle of the buffalo hunt to answer their cellphones. (Believe it or not, some of these breaches are that big.)<br /><br />Therefore, this version just doesn't work for me. I think this is a shame too, because this version could have been so much better if they had only done their homework and made it realistic.<br /><br />Bwould take me 12 hours, and I have better things to do.

B000077VR3|4.0|My dad saw this and he didn't like it.  Thinking to myself I wouldn't like it either, I watched it.  To my surprise, I loved it.  Sure, it has its boring moments, but don't ALL films have those?  I found it very entertaining and thought altogether was a masterpiece. <br /> <br />This movie is a play in a play.  Christian (Ewan McGregor), a writer, falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman).  Although Satine HAS to fall in love with and marry The Duke, she's caught between her career and true love.   <br /> <br />The music is fantastic.  The acting was good; Nicole and Ewan light up the screen.  Kidman is hilarious, so is the rest of the cast.  In the movie, there'd be random scenes where Satine (Kidman) would faint.  One scene, Satine faints in the middle of her performance.  She falls from where she was sitting and lands in the crowd.  Of course, the audience thinks it's all part of the act, so the show goes on (Satine is sent to be fixed up until next scene). <br /> <br />Moulin Rouge is an extraordinary performance, both movie and play in play.  Watch it and see for yourself!  <br />
B00004Z459|2.0|I dont know, maybe I'm just old school. But what do people see in this music?  Its not hard rock at all. The lyrics to the songs are too soft,they are too cleancut. And the singer, whoever he is, has a terrible \\"rock\\" voice. I just think that this new generation has really missed out on good authentic hard rock music. To me, I know its just my opinion, Guns N Roses was a true hard rock band. (May they rest in peace) Nobody could match their energy or intensity ,certaintly not this lame band. All I have to say to youn LP fans, buy a copy of Appetite for Destruction and listen to it once and then tell me which band truly rocks. If you still think LP is better: then I give up.
0375707972|3.0|Though I enjoyed the book, I do sense that the writing got flattened out during the translation process. It felt dull, hollow, as if some intermediary was paraphrasing what the author had originally written. Just my feeling. Though I did like it in spite of this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the Serenity DVD, and enjoyed it. I watched the DVD extras, and was blown away by the heart of the fans, the author, and the cast. I bought the Firefly series, and whoosh! I feel like I entered a world of Sci-Fi magic, that only opened up after it was closed down. If these folks come out with either another movie, or the noodleheads who cancelled the TV series eat crow, and renew the season, and come out with season TWO, I'll buy either. Joss Whedon is a brilliant, and inspired, creator.
B000CNESU8|5.0|It's hard to imagine a movie about the television industry that can be better than \\"Network\\". Simply put, \\"Network\\" works on every level, whether it's the screenwriting, the casting, or the direction by Sydney Lumet's deft abilities.  <br />  Robert Duvall as the smarmy network executive, Faye Dunaway as the work-obsessed and dysfunctional femme fatale, and Ned Beatty lighting up the screen with his seemingly omniscient company owner all help make this movie good. But it is William Holden and Peter Finch who truly shine in their roles and propel this movie to greatness (alongside of the excellent dialogue). Finch pulls out all the stops as the insane Howard Beale, and his transformation before our very eyes from crusty yet harmless drunk to a seriously deranged \\"Mad Prophet\\" is amazing to see. William Holden brings his usual sense of gravitas to the role; his weary man of the world schtick has never had such good dialogue to work with, and his performance is tinged with a vulnerability that is a lesson in nuance. <br />    Speaking of the dialogue, \\"Network\\" was my first introduction to the work of Paddy Chayefsky (who also wrote the screenplay for the superb \\"Americanization of Emily\\"). Just like that movie, the writing here is uniformly excellent, with characters bieng imbued with an eloquence that one can only wish for in real life. Here is a script that strikes a chord like few others, with its depiction of a society controlled by a box in the living room and the madness behind it all.  <br />    Required viewing for anyone who appreciates good movies.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|Like many \\"horror\\"/Thriller movies that have come out between 1996, i.e. \\"Scream\\",  and most of 2005 there hasn't been much to talk about for this genre, filled with many things that go bump in the night and cheesy plot lines.  \\"Dark Water\\" is hardly any different than that, with the execption of decent acting by Jennifer Connelly.  Much of the story line in \\"Dark Water\\"  is much like the story line you would find in movies like \\"The Ring\\" and \\"Sixth Sense\\".  A kid and their parents or a parent or adult figure who slowly begin the realize that there is a ghostly presence who is filled with anger and rage because of something that happened to the ghostly presence in life.  Been there, seen it more than once.  It has been getting old since \\"Sixth Sense\\" first came out.  Holloywood needs to find new material for horror films.  Because this movie is no more than an average rental during halloween, if that often.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I was glued to my seat when this movie ended, reliving the heartbreaking story of two unlikely people who fall in love.  The theme song is haunting and I rushed to buy the last CD after the movie ended.  It is too bad that I could not find  one male who would accompany me.  It is unfortunate that many will not see this brilliant movie.  Ledger was totally absorbed in his character and definitely worthy of the Oscar.  Guylenhall deserves as much credit, but more so in a supporting role.  I will see it again and buy the DVD because it is that good.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This is a movie that is not afraid to take you places, some of the scariest, but also some of the most wonderful places of the heart.   Hilary Swank is brilliant in this picture about a gender confused teen who is trying to find herself in a very turbulent world.   I can see why Clint Eastwood picked Swank for \\"Million Dollar Baby.\\"  She is the perfect choice for both pictures.      Peter Saarsguard as John, one of the redneck bad boys in the film, is absolutely chilling.  His ignorance, paranoia and anger are very real on the screen.
B000A3XYZA|4.0|Two very good DVD recordings of Handel's great opera Rodelinda became available in 2005. One of them is from a 1998 performance at the Glyndebourne festival and the other from a 2003 performance at the Bavarian State Opera. I will call them, respectively, British and German, although both are truly international. For example, in the British version both kings are sung by Germans, while the German version features British singers in these major roles. The \\"British\\" conductor is native American (William Christie),  and his \\"German\\" counterpart (Ivor Bolton) is British. The staging directors are French and American, respectively. <br />Much has been said by other reviewers about the British version, and I agree with most of these mostly favorable comments, especially in respect to the great art of Anna Caterina Antonacci and Andreas Scholl. I believe, however, that most of these reviewers have not been exposed to the German recording, which seems to be less popular. I have had a chance to experience both versions extensively on a state of the art video and stereo system. <br />I prefer the staging and filming of the British performance and the artistic presentation of some singers, especially Louise Winter and Kurt Streit. The more lyric quality overall of the singing may be attractive to some viewers of the British DVD. In my opinion, both techniques of presentation are acceptable. Subtitles provided in English, German, Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese help in appreciating the dramatic plot.  <br />I do have serious problems with the sound quality of the British rendition: Compared with the warm and vibrant sound of the German version, the sound produced by the British DVD is somewhat flat and muffled. The German but not the British version gives a feeling of being in the presence of a live performance. Apparently the German version was recorded by state of the art equipment and/or techniques. <br />In conclusion, no ideal video recording of Rodelinda is available today. The opera was performed more recently under the baton of William Christie at Glyndebourne and Paris. Judging from the raving reviews of these apparently unrecorded performances on the Internet, I am hopeful that one day I will be able to view a performance of Rodelinda on DVD that will satisfy me completely.               <br />  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000025JU0|4.0|After buying this I fell in love with OMD and the album spent a lot of time on my turntable(dating myself).  I never cared for instrumentals and always skip them so I ignored the title track, but the rest of the album was great.  The songs have aged pretty well and my favorites are ones most people ignore.  \\"Love & Violence\\", and \\"Hard Day\\" are brilliant.  \\"Love & Violence\\" captures the behavior of a couple going through difficulties in their relationship with chilling accuracy and \\"Hard Day\\", does the same for the working class. This is a great CD and is enjoyable on many levels. <br />
B00004Z459|4.0|I remember some time in 2001 when I went to a CD store and heard \\" Crawling \\". It was great, with a hard edge of rock with some rhyming thrown in. I liked it, so I asked the clerk who it was. he told me it was Linkin Park. I told him I never heard of them. He pointed it out to me. I ended up buying it and going home and I listened to it. I loved it so much. Sitting here 4 years later, I still listen to it at least one time a week. The whole CD is strong. My favorite track is \\" Curing the Itch\\". Joe Hahn is my idol!
B00068NVI4|4.0|One of my fondest Yes memories is watching from the 14th row at Madison Square Garden circa 1977 (it was the Going For the One tour) as the band rocked out. And back then they truly were all about rock...albeit prog rock, but indeed it was about rock. Jon Anderson sang like an angel. Rick Wakeman returned to his rightful place in the band (replacing a fair Patrick Moraz) and hid behind long flowing blonde hair as he literally almost rocked his keyboards off the stage at one point. And Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White pumped out their intricate, precisely played melodies. All woven together to absolutely knock The Garden audience out of their seats. Literally. Everyone stood on their seats throughout the whole show.<br /><br />Flash forward to May 2004 where the boys are together to shoot a DVD during their 35th Anniversary tour. Well, seems that the guys have aged a bit from 1977 to 2004 (almost 30 years!!!), but certainly you'd never know it from listening to the musical performances in Songs from Tsongas. Jon Anderson's vocals sound superb. He hits every note (in the '77 show that I saw he had an unforgettable mis-step in Roundabout); Howe and Squire play their instruments precisely and their back up vocals sound as if you're listening to the studio versions; Wakeman and White are also as precise as the studio versions of their setlist. And that setlist is as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 (65:17)<br />1. Intro/Firebird suite<br />2. Going for the one<br />3. Sweet dreams<br />4. Your move/I've seen all good people<br />5. Mind drive Part 1 and 2<br />6. South side of the sky<br />7. Turn of the century<br />8. My eyes/Mind drive part 3<br />9. Yours is no disgrace<br /><br />Disc 2 (85:14)<br />1. The meeting room/The meeting<br />2. Long distance runaround<br />3. Wonderous stories<br />4. Time is time<br />5. Rounabout<br />6. Show me<br />7. Owner of a lonely heart<br />8. Second initial<br />9. Rhythm of love<br />10. And you and I<br />11. Ritual<br />12. Every little thing<br />13. Starship trooper<br /><br />Total Time: 150:31. Now that's a nice dose! The picture is crystal clear, and you have a choice between Dolby or DTS 5.1; it sounded very, very good. The DVD quality lends a nice effect of being in the front row of the show instead of simply sitting in front of the TV.<br /><br />It took away from the live effect a bit for me, but I skipped around to the pre-1980s stuff first, then I watched the whole show again the next evening. I was really glad that I did that, because there was a lot of material that (I couldn't believe that) I didn't even know from the 1980 forward period. The new and newer stuff is a nice bonus and \\"nice to have\\", but the pre-1980 stuff is why I bought the disk, it's performed precisely and it's \\"need to have\\" for Yes fans of that era.<br /><br />Yes fans need to hit the buy button now!<br /><br />P.S. - Warning: For those fans that were teenagers or older in the 70s, this DVD will make you feel your age! The Yes in my mind were the Yes from 1977. Silly, I know. But it was a shock in this DVD for me to see Steve Howe looking like the Cryptkeeper (he still rocked though). And an aged Rick Wakeman literally just stood there behind his keyboards like a zombie completely, emotionlessly still through each song (didn't take away from his awesome renditions).!

B000008M1P|5.0|When this album came out, we were in another dimension and another times. All the bands were trying to have a good time. So is no wonder that there were much more rock fans than today.<br /><br />The first time I knew about VIXEN was in a CIRCUS magazine (which I still have) specifically in the back cover of it. Then I bought the tape and saw the video on MTV. Even when I haven't heard them I knew that they couldn't be that bad (at least you have the looks!!!!!!!!).<br /><br />To my surprise this is a very good album, very enjoyable and very catchy. It's repetitive to keep saying that the glam metal, hair metal, soft rock, hard rock, 80's, soft metal and we can go on & on & on & on (yes, like RAVEN). I don't know if this fits in any style but it's good. It's pretty much the same music you kept hearing at the end of the eighties.  I mean, WHITESNAKE, WHITE LION, KISS, DEF LEPPARD, ETC.<br /><br />The three singles did a decent job on the lists (for a first album was great) \\"Edge Of A Broken Heart\\", \\"Cryin\\", \\"Love Made Me\\". The rest of the songs are quite surprising too. My personal favorite is \\"Desperate\\" which combines a great slow acoustic intro with a great deep rock at the middle and in the end of the song.<br /><br />The girls are quite hot, very good looking (specially Janet Gardner). Janet is a very good singer and Jan Kuehnemund is almost as good guitarist as Lita. Roxy Petrucci, the drummer started her career with a band called MADAM X which is were Sebastian Bach from SKID ROW came from. Ironically, SKID ROW was very hot at the same time.  ENOUGH TRIVIA!!!<br /><br />If your are into this kind of music, this is a winner. Maybe a little pop, but definitely a winner.<br /><br />Highlight: Edge of A Broken Heart, Desperate, Love Made Me.<br />Lowlight: MHMHMHMHM, I don't know....................Have to think a little bit longer this one.
B00004TFRF|1.0|Buyers take note- The seller states that \\"This is the PAL Region 2. Multi-Region dvd player will play.\\". None of the other reviews make this distinction. Your normal american dvd player will not play this. Hopefully someone with a multi-region dvd player will actually buy a copy and review it so we can get a clue what the quality of this copy is like.
B000005S0I|4.0|Listening today to The Cure's debut album \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\", originally released in May of 1979, it's intriguing to see how it compares with their subsequent '80s records.  But don't get the wrong idea--even though Robert Smith himself has admitted over the years to not being particularly happy with this album, \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" is far more than a mere curiosity for diehard Cure fans; this is a highly impressive debut album.  It's even more remarkable when you consider that Smith was less than 2 months past his 20th birthday when the album was released, and his vocals do have a youthful exuberance on many of these songs.    The group often displays a sense of humor here that's completely absent from the next few albums.  Songs that point this out include \\"Grinding Halt\\", with its 'bouncing ball' intro and 'dying engine' ending; the amusing, cartoonishly creepy \\"Subway Song\\"; the rambling \\"So What\\" with its classified-section lyrics; and the Jimi Hendrix cover \\"Foxy Lady\\" which actually features then-bass guitarist Michael Dempsey on lead vocals, and sounds mind-bogglingly like Devo.  Also, although not intentionally funny, notice how Lol Tolhurst, who was the drummer at the time, falls back on the same damn drum fill on all of the uptempo numbers, which does get to be a bit annoying--it's been reported he wasn't a very accomplished drummer at the time, and it really does show.    There are also no noticeable keyboards anywhere on the album.  A harmonica crops up on \\"Subway Song\\", but that's basically the only deviation from the guitar-bass-drums instrumental arrangements.  Somewhat ironically though, this album actually comes across as a bit more diverse than the next couple.      Although many of the tunes sound underwritten, there's lots and lots of ear-catching stuff here.  \\"Object\\" is surprisingly punkish; and the uptempo \\"Grinding Halt\\" has a great bass hook and sounds strikingly similar to The Jam.  The skeletal, starkly-arranged \\"10:15 Saturday Night\\" is engagingly mysterious-sounding.  \\"Accuracy\\" and \\"Meathook\\" each have crafty guitar licks.  \\"Another Day\\", with its woozy-sounding guitar intro, is a very fine tune with a melancholy, yet strangely uplifting feel.  \\"So What\\" has an irresistibly catchy, riffy backing track.  \\"Fire In Cairo\\" is a wonderfully catchy, mellow, mid-tempo minor-keyed tune; and also excellent is the title track which strongly foreshadows the direction the band would take on the following album \\"Seventeen Seconds\\".    So, although it's not a masterpiece like so many of The Cure's '80s albums, \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" is still a very fine start to their astonishingly great career.    (P.S.  \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" in its entirety wasn't released in the US until Rhino issued it in a 2 CD \\"deluxe\\" format in December of 2004.  In late '79 or early '80, the \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" album was released in the US which uses 8 tracks from the \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" album, and adds the title track, \\"Plastic Passion\\", \\"Jumping Someone Else's Train\\", and \\"Killing An Arab\\" to the track list.  If you're on a budget and/ or aren't a totally obsessive fan, you're probably better off just sticking to the \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" release for your fix of pre-'80s Cure.)
0307276902|5.0|I guess hindsight is 20-20.  Take a look at the earliest ratings.  The majority of them are 4-5 stars.  Now, all of a sudden everybody hates the book because they realized right from the beginning that all the stuff that happened couldn't be true.  I read this book before all this crap came out and it was a great book then and its still a great book.
0099483556|5.0|Though this book is only of average length, it has the feel of a big family saga, so completely does McEwan delve into the consciousness of his main characters as they attempt to cope with the long-term repercussions of a \\"crime\\" committed by Briony Tallis, a naïve 13-year-old with a \\"controlling demon.\\" Briony's \\"wish for a harmonious, organised world denie[s] her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing,\\" so it is doubly ironic that her attempt to \\"fix\\" what she sees as wrongdoing involving her sister and Robbie Turner, a childhood friend, becomes, in itself, a wrongdoing, one she feels compelled to deny and for which she will eventually attempt to atone.<br /><br />Opening the novel in 1935, McEwan creates an intense, edgy, and almost claustrophobic mood. England is on the brink of war; Briony, a budding writer, is on the edge of adolescence; her newly graduated sister Cecilia is thinking of her future life; and Robbie is about to start medical school. The summer is unusually hot. Troubled young cousins have arrived because their parents are on the verge of divorce; Briony's mother is suffering from migraines; her father is \\"away,\\" working for the government; her adored brother Leon and a friend have arrived from Cambridge; and Briony, an \\"almost only child,\\" with a hypersensitive imagination, finds her world threatened.<br /><br />Step by step, McEwan leads his characters to disaster, each individual action and misstep simple, explainable, and logical. The engaged reader sees numerous dramatic ironies and waits for everything to snap. When Briony finally commits her long-foreshadowed \\"crime,\\" the results are cataclysmic, and the world, as they know it, ends for several characters.<br /><br />Giving depth to his themes of truth, justice, honesty, guilt and innocence, and punishment and atonement, McEwan uses shifting points of view and an extended time frame. Part I is Briony's. In Part II, five years after the \\"crime,\\" Robbie, now a footsoldier retreating from the French countryside to Dunkirk, continues the same themes, seeing the crimes of war, not only between the combatants but against civilians and, at Dunkirk, by the Brits against each other. In Part III, Briony, atoning for her earlier crime by working as a student nurse, rather than studying to be a writer, brings the past and present together, tending the casualties of war. The ending takes place in 1999, at her 77th birthday party.<br /><br />This is a totally absorbing, fully developed novel, the kind one always yearns for and so rarely finds. The characters, the atmosphere, the lush descriptions, the sensitively treated themes, the intriguing and unusual plot, and the rare entr&eacute;e into the mind of a writer, both Briony and McEwan, make this novel an absorbing experience from beginning to end. Mary Whippleng from the French countryside to Dunkirk, continues the same themes, seeing the crimes of war, not only between the combatants but against civilians and, at Dunkirk, by the Brits against each other.

B000002UDB|5.0|While Sgt Pepper had at least some basic pop elements in all its songs ( major exception being, \\"A Day In The Life\\" ) some of the songs on this album are clearly not from this world.  John Lennon and Paul McCartney are definitely not on the same planet together as far as their song writing goes.  Lennon takes a far more progressive approach to his work using experimental and sometimes Avant-Garde influences.  McCartney uses a more conventional but no less impressive pop and whimsical flavor to his songwriting. <br /> <br />While some tracks like the title track stick to the usual pop formula,  others like, \\"I Am The Walrus\\",  make it seem as though the album title, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", is an understatement.  The latter track is a extremely bizarre experiment that has Lennon shouting nonsense lines over strange overdubs and sections of unidentified noise.  Lennon's other show piece on the album, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", has become a psychedelic standard.  Based on an actual place near the Beatles' home this track uses everything from mellotrons to backwards drums and distorted guitars.  McCartney is far more conventional in his approach with psychedelic pop tunes such as, \\"Hello Goodbye\\", and, \\"Penny Lane\\", the latter which has become another pop standard.  His, \\"Fool On A Hill\\", number remains one of the Beatles' most whimsical and easy going songs they made. <br /> <br />Tracks three through five mark nearly the only time album tracks have been included on a Beatles record.  \\"Flying\\", is one of the very few instrumentals the boys ever did.  \\"Blue Jay\\", and, \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", are also here, the former by Harrison being another one of his Indian songs and the latter being yet another McCartney pop tune.  The only part of the album that somewhat has a unified concept is the last two tracks.  \\"Baby Your A Rich Man\\",  states the success and beauty of the sixties generation and, \\"All You Need Is Love\\",  explores that theme even more so by telling that generation that they need more love for each other, not just romance but love for mankind as well. <br /> <br />This album is another example of how much the fab four have evolved from the early days of, \\"Please Please Me\\".  The fact that Lennon and McCartney are no longer writing similar material creates a contrasted assortment of different elements that make the record that much more memorable.  This is without a doubt an essential edition to your Beatles collection.
0671015206|1.0|A friend loaned me this book because it was 'so great'.  I tried to read it, then I tried to skim it.  Even skimming was painful.  The message (millionaires accumlate wealth by sending less) was so simple it could have been written on a postcard.  This message was repeated endlessly.  No actionable steps were given.  The book is a complete waste of time. Now, I'm reconsidering my assessment of friends who have liked this book.
B00003CXD0|5.0|I rate \\"Tootsie\\" 5 stars because it's humorous, the music is uplifting and the acting is superb!<br /><br />\\"Tootsie\\" is about an out-of-work actor played by Dustin Hoffman, who decides that women have it easier when getting movie parts, so he concocts a scheme unbeknowst to his agent. The scheme consists of Dustin Hoffman dressing up as an older woman, who auditions for a soap. Fortunately, for him he gets the soap and that's just the beginning...<br /><br />I highly recommend this 80's film for anyone who is either a Dustin Hoffman fan, or who likes a light-hearted comedy with an interesting twist to it!<br /><br />Rent or buy it--you'll be glad you did, I was!<br /><br />*(Recommended for ages 18+ above due to adult themes).
0553801503|2.0|I've read the three earlier books in this series, although I am getting a little tired of the constant grimness and lack of realistic world building. (Unlike the Lord of the Rings, to which this series is sometimes compared, there are no moments of transcendent beauty of redemption.) <br /> <br />I looked forward to this fourth volume. But it is choppy, disconnected, and boring to read beyond belief. A few of the stories are compelling, and is is always fun to see nasty things happen to nasty people (I leave you to guess to whom I am are referring). <br /> <br />Unlike reviewers who suggest Mr. Martin bowed to publisher pressure to release this book in its current form, I suspect that with Mr. Martin's fan base he could have shaped this book anyway he'd have liked. I don't really think he cares anymore, and I suspect (as the author bio suggests) he feels trapped. (...\\"[w]henever he's allowed to leave [the Seven Kingdoms (where A Feast for Crows takes place)]\\"). <br /> <br />If the author doesn't want to be there, you probably don't either. I suggest you find something better to do with your time!
B0006284JQ|4.0|It's crazy that there are so many people releasing greatest hits albums recently. However, some are more credible than others. Among the newer artists releasing these packages (I still think of Britney as relatively new since she has only been on the scene since 1999)is Mrs. Spears and her brand of polished bubble gum and a surprising knack for keeping her sound fresh with each album. She still had her own signature sound, a familiar 90's pop bassline and an ultra sticky hook made for a hit song in the late 90's and early 00's. It will be interesting to see what the new pop will sound like since Mariah has made a comeback, Black Eyed Peas are bringing the funk (even though it's pretty tepid), Jessica Simpson's little sister is under the impression she is a rock star, Justin Timberlake has ended N' Sync and Gwen Stefani was the pop goddess of 2005. But with Britney's collection, you can recall the days when pop stars did not pretend to be anything else but pop stars and it was all innocent, shameless fun. She first burst on the scene with the smoking \\"...Baby One More Time\\". That first song remains her finest moment. It's relentlessly striking, has the power to convert any anti- Britney fan, and instantly sparked Madonna comparisons. Much like Madonna, Britney has used sexuality and a good ear for what sounds hot to catipult her career. While Britney should still take notes from Madonna's carefully calculated moves, she is indeed hot on Madge's heels. \\"...Baby\\" changed the world of pop overnight, giving us a huge female idol for the 90's, much like \\"Lucky Star\\" made Madonna a household name annd the rest is timeless MTV history. Britney's catalog is quite impressive, even if at times it's spotty. \\"I'm not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" has never been a personal favorite of mine, and the lackluster \\"Outrageous\\" could have been replaced with \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\", a beautiful song and video. The Bobby Brown cover is nice and fitting to Britney's media frenzy, and while I'd like to say Bobby shouldn't have given it to her, his awful reality show makes me not even care his version is better. It's Britney who is still relevant to the pop world, and not Bobby or Whitney (what happened there!)\\"Toxic\\" is one of her best recent songs, and the haunting \\"Everytime\\" is \\"Sometime\\"'s twisted sister. Then there's \\"OOPs I Did It Again\\", \\"Lucky\\", \\"Stronger\\", and \\"Crazy\\" each with that pounding bassline that has become Britney's signature trick. Britney's duet with Madonna on \\"Me Against the Music\\" could have been better somehow but it's pretty rockin' just the same. Frantic, sweaty and gettin' kind of hectic, these two could be pop's wonder twins year round if they put their heads together (and not just at the MTV awards). Like Madonna, expecially during the time of The Immaculate Collection album, Britney's image has been more sexual than her actual music. \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" practically drips sex, and in all it's raunchy glory, remains one of my favorite songs in the collection. I don't understand the rush to get these hits out so early, but then again these songs do stand up very well considering Britney first gyrated in her Catholic school girl uniform not too long ago. But times have changed, and in an age where nostalgia seems to always win out over new invention, why not? Where music is concerned there are no rules, rhyme or reason how it all works. And while I live in fear of a pop world ruled by Lyndsay, Ashlee, and Hillary, I have faith that the Mariahs, Madonnas and Britneys will take back what's theirs. That's right, girl. You're in the club now.
B00006LI4S|5.0|If you read customers' reviews to help you choose, you are, most probably, a \\"qualified\\" fan, otherwise why look it up? Yet, can you doubt David Gilmour?<br /><br />This DVD is magnificent, hauntingly beatiful, musically superb, and fantastically enchanting. Please don't bother reading any negative reviews (Gilmour is out of shape... too old... c'mon). As far as I am concerned his inner unpretentious beauty shines even more through his wrinkles, and his somewhat raspy voice matured beautifully, his smile is as delicious as always, and his hands are really fine, flying effortlessly, recreating true heartfelt magic. All the musicians are outstanding, and Caroline Dale is just amazing and gorgeously delectable.<br /><br />This DVD is a real pleasure to watch and listen to. Do yourself a favour, no amount is too great to give yourself this gift. And for all those bad reviewers, I strongly suggest to consider uniting and entertaining each other.
074325144X|5.0|My application of Danny's running techniques all but eliminated foot pain I had due to pronation and completely eliminated knee pain.  It made running a joyful workout instead of a fitness chore.  I described some of the running techniques to my podiatrist and he was impressed enough with my results and the basic mechanics that he's now recommending this running technique to patients.  Whenever I've noticed any pain returning, on refreshing my memory with Danny's techniques I've realized I was forgetting to do some things, and when returning to those practices my running has improved again.  I simply cannot argue with these results.<br /><br />You don't have to be a New Age believer for these techniques to work.  Set aside the occasionally pseudo-scientific basis for some of his statements and don't worry about it.  These instructions are less descriptive of what you are -actually- doing than what it -feels like- you are doing, i.e. what you imagine you are doing.  So much of running is about your mental state since after all, it's your brain that tells the rest of your body what to do! Remember that Danny's really coaching your mind.  Apply the Eastern philosophy concepts as a mental construct, an alternative model if you will.  It's far more important to learn to run pain free and injury free.<br /><br />Finally, don't let all the focuses overwhelm you.  Just pick one or two at a time to work on at any given run.
B000023VR6|5.0|What can I say?  To top this album is indescriable.  Dre released this when I was a young'n and I am still bumpin' it to this day.  The guest appearances are straight west coast all the way.  no wonder people from NYC hate on Dre.  XXXplosive has to be my favoirte track on this one.  THe chronic was back in '92 this is 2001 but released in 1999.  This is rockin', dont forget who commercialized the west.  Because we all know that Too $hort was bumpin when Dre was gettin into NWA.  THis is some of the best rap/hip-hop that you will hear in the last 10 to 15 years.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I'm going to admit something here that I probably shouldn't: I haven't read ANY of the books in the HARRY POTTER series (don't hurt me!) It might be because everyone says \\"Oh you just HAVE to read this!\\" that puts me off. I'm not the type of person to follow all the lemmings over the cliff. I tend to enjoy more obscure stuff. But I digress...<br /><br />What I don't mind doing, though, is watching cinema and I've thus far seen all of the \\"Potter films.\\" And this one I found to be quite different. Although the second in the series (THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, 2002) was pretty dark, it pales (brightens?) in comparison to this third installment.<br /><br />Harry is breaking the rules and barely getting away with it. He's using his powers outside of school and in general muggles population (he causes a relative to inflate to great size and drift away). And when he can no longer stand staying with his aunt and uncle, Harry decides to leave and seek refuge in the outside world. The trouble, though, is that a dark creature seems to be stalking him. Was that a wolf peering at Harry through the brush?<br /><br />Eventually Harry makes it back to Hogwarts and discovers that a psycho prisoner - Sirius Black, played by the wonderful Gary Oldman (BATMAN BEGINS, 2005) - has escaped his cage and may be stalking him. Was Sirius responsible in some way for Harry's parents' death?<br /><br />Dementos, dark specters that resemble wraiths, are assigned to the perimeter of Hogwarts and Harry has some very uneasy feelings about them. They seem inordinately interested in him, too.<br /><br />With the help of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) Harry is led down a dark path, a path believed to contain the secret to his mother's and father's death.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Friends and enemies are often intertwined within the same characters as this third story unravels. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, 2001) gives some excellent direction to a film that could've easily gotten out of control. With the multiple twists and turns (i.e., time travel, werewolf friends, etc.) this film flowed smoothly and was packed with angst and action.<br /><br />The special effects (specifically the early bus ride) are pulled off nicely and give a slight sense of the whimsical without going overboard. But the previously mentioned wraith-like Dementos are pretty creepy and could easily freak-out children under 12 years old (so be careful, parents.)<br /><br />Again, not having read any of the books in this series, I have no idea where the storyline is going. But things tend to be darkest before the storm (forgive the cliche), then they clear. So my assumption is that things will come to a head very soon for Harry and his Hogwart friends. Darn! I might have to pick up one of the novels now!mies are often intertwined within the same characters as this third story unravels.

0920668372|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful and a wonderful way to reassure your baby (however old they are) that you will always be there for them.  However, I have yet to get past page 2 without crying.  I don't mean eyes a-glisten--I mean outright sobbing!  If you are at all sentimental, be prepared to get into the whole \\"these are happy tears\\" shpeil with your kids.  This one is a tear-jerker, but worth it!
068987474X|4.0|The authors point out that for ages women have been wasting their time meeting over coffee, drinks, or late-night phone calls to discuss their dating problems with men.  They conclude that men aren't that complicated - they're simply driven by sex, though would like to pretend otherwise.  Thus, if things aren't going that well for the female in a relationship, maybe he's just not that into you.<br /><br />The purpose of the book is to help women read the signs and evaluate their relationships - often using humor.  The \\"bottom line\\" is that if a sane guy really likes you, nothing's going to get in his way; alternatively, if he's not sane, why would you want him?  The material is based on questions received from women in real situations.<br /><br />Entertaining, and generally humorous; however, it is too short and easily assimilated to be worth paying $20+ for - just take a few minutes and read in in the bookstore, or at least until you get the idea/main point.

B00005JNQA|4.0|I started to watch this movie in my Dentist's chair. I barely got through the first half hour by the time he was finished.  The opening is really strong -suspense and excitement you could cut with a knife. And then I had to leave! I was hooked and had to see the end so I went out and got a copy and I'm happy I did.  The interplay and sexual tension between Penn and Kiddman was done with a masterful hand. The plot, a little farfetched if you looked too closely, had enough twists and turns to keep me focused and engaged. The action - explosions, chase scenes, shoot outs - was well done and not over done (given the current trend where action alone transcends plot and character).<br /><br />The wrap-up (in my opinion) was not up to the quality and excitement of the opening scenes and I left wishing for an alternate ending.  But I loved the fact that this was shot on location (NYC makes a great backdrop) and had a New York look and feel about it.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was a fun suspense thriller, definitely worth a look. It probably could have been better but, heck, this review could have been written better!

B00080ZG10|3.0|Even though he was morally bankrupt, Howard Hughes was an interesting and important figure in aviation history. Martin Scorsese is an equally interesting and important figure to modern filmmaking, and, based upon his films, equally depraved. Despite their spiritual corruption, wouldn't you expect the combination of these two interesting and important figures to produce an interesting - if not important - film? But not so.<br /><br />Visually interesting? Very. The photography is exquisite. Rather than using a traditional sepia tint to give the film that vintage look, the design team uses a sophisticated palette of greens and oranges - the favorite of interior designers - producing a very stunning look. Scorsese's camera eye is as deft as ever, although there are some rather poor cuts in the film. The special effects and recreations of the planes are also exceptional. Most everything shown is real, with very little CGI work. And the period music is nicely balanced.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the drama doesn't follow suit. Almost across the board, recreations of famous people are colorful, yet uninteresting and unconvincing. DiCaprio as Howard Hughes is adequate, but not memorable, as such a legendary - and some would say, heroic - figure requires. He put a lot of research into this part; but I think his desire to fill Hughe's shoes was wishful thinking. He is definitely not the charismatic leader that Howard Hughes probably was, but instead seems weak. For that matter, most of the movie star characters seem artificial. Even Cate Blanchett playing Katherine Hepburn fails to have the wispy, alluring quality that defined Hepburn. Only Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, who wanted to clip Hughes' wings, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the president of competing airline, Pan Am, turn in compelling performances.<br /><br />The story, which should have held everything together, adds little more than a framework for displaying the various vignettes of Hughe's life. Hughes lived a larger life than most men, and that should have come across in the film, but it doesn't. What does come across are his excesses: too much money, too many women, too many toys; and later, too many obsessions, too many compulsions. But what about the character of the man? That, along with the story, seems to have gotten lost in the excesses of the director. Unlike Citizen Kane - which the movie seems to be trying to imitate, and which, unlike this film, did show the inner workings of a driven man - The Aviator simply scratches the surface.<br /><br />As can be expected from any Scorsese film, the audience is left with nothing more to chew on than the paradox of how such brilliance and depravity can coexist in the same man, and of Scorsese in particular. It is almost inconceivable how someone can see so much and understand so little. It is a shame that such talent has been wasted on someone so void of soul and character. Like Hughes, he wallows in the excesses of a life out of control, wrongly thinking that he is somehow blessed above other men. And, like Hughes, he will eventually drive himself mad from his excesses, and reap all the emptiness that such a life deserves.<br /><br />In the DVD's favor, there are more extra features that you can imagine. If you don't learn about the real Howard Hughes from the movie itself, you might get an inkling of what he was like from the features. There are several on Hughes, including a History Channel presentation, and a couple on the disease that he supposedly suffered from: OCD. In addition, almost every department of the production team has its own feature. So, what the film lacks in drama, the features try to make up for. But nothing can make up for Scorsese's - or Hughes' - lack of spiritual consciousness.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithfe than most men, and that should have come across in the film, but it doesn't.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|Really, who cares about the \\"copy-protected\\" feature. I surely don't, because this is a great album filled with great music. Whether it was copy-protected or not, it would not affect the overall experience of this CD. However, if the copy-protected does bother you, then use the many techniques out there to \\"defeat\\" the computer. <br />OK, now let's get into the review. First of all, I want to say I'm a newcomer to Foo Fighters. I've heard a few songs of their earlier albums, but I do not know every single song they've made. Nonetheless, judging by the great tracks In Your Honor possesses, I could say Foo Fighters is one of the greatest bands out there.  <br />In Your Honor is divided into 2 CD's. The first CD features the heavy, head-banging songs. In the second CD, the Foo Fighters slow things down with ballads and acoustic rhythms.  <br />The first CD is amazing. Songs like In Your Honor, No Way Back, Best of You, DOA, and End Over End (all in the first CD) simply make you want to jump off the walls. One of my favorite songs in the first CD is Hell, even though it is one of the shortest songs in the album clocking in at 1:57.  <br />The second CD, like I said earlier, is slower. Foo Fighters drop the electric guitars and the amps for the acoustic guitars, violins and the harmonicas. Songs like What If I Do?, Miracle, Another Round, and Cold Day In the Sun are memorable. I am not a big fan of the second set of songs, but that does not mean it is not as outstanding as the first. <br />If you're a long-time Foo Fighters fan then you already have this CD. If you've recently been introduce to the Foo Fighters then In Your Honor is a great place to start your collection.

B00003CWPL|1.0|I suppose one is supposed to find something artful to say about an art film; I can't say anything but to plainly advise everyone to avoid it-unless you take some perverse pleasure in having profoundly disturbing imagery injected into your brain without local anesthesia.<br /><br />The Movie \\"Brazil\\" was also disturbing, but at least the cinemetography was a rich visual tapestry. What can one say about a nightmarish film noir which vividly portrays one's most nauseating, nerve fraying fears in  relentless stabbing strokes of black and white? This is what the truly \\"lost\\" would find amusing and stimulating....\\"lost\\" meaning all those wretched souls who will one day descend, permanently, into a reality much like this one. If it was supposed to save us from moral and cultural decline, it failed miserably. Life is too short , brutish and nasty to spend one's time wallowing in the interminably brutish and nasty. Move on...don't waste your time. A mind is too precious a commodity  to putrify.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok Computer is the best album written in the 90's.  Some would debate that a band like Nirvana or perhaps a hip hop act like Dr. Dre should deserve to hoist the 'i wrote the best album of the 90's' plague above their heads, and i understand their reasoning.  Hip hop as a genre took mammoth steps in the 90's, much due to the prolific songs written and produced by some the more influential hip hop artists (Dr. Dre, Biggie, Snoop, etc.), and Nirvana is often viewed as the figurehead of alternative rock, changing both the subject matter and production styles of mainstream rock music.  Not to take anything away from them, but Ok Computer is a masterpiece.  It shall stand as tall as 'Dark Side of the Moon' stands now in the thirty years.  It will still sell thousands of copies a year in thirty years.  It will influence (and has influenced) a new generation of songwriters to push all the boundaries established by a half century of stagnant rock formulas.  Every Radiohead record deserves a 5.  If you don't like it, it is probably because you have questionable taste  in music, art, and philosophy; and modern society has most likely  already brainwashed you beyond repair.
0316172324|4.0|This is not a book that will teach you to make better decisions in the blink of an eye.  There is no magic formula in this book that will change your decision making. <br /> <br />It will however try to show you how we all \\"thin slice\\" people and situations even without realizing it.  The author gives many examples to support this theory.  There is alot of information in this book about how the police officers thin slice people, sometimes correctly and sometimes incorrectly with horrible results.  The book talks about Amadou Diallo of NY extensively and the police officers who fired 41 shots, killing Amadou Diallo.   <br /> <br />My favorite chapter in the book is the last chapter: Listening with your eyes.  I think this chapter captures the essence of the book better than any other. <br /> <br />Many of the example in this book, I think, can be explained by the fact that our experiences say alot about our decision making.  The tennis pro, the sculpture artist, the police officers all make a \\"gut\\" decision because they have all been faced with similar situations before.  There is no magic in their decision making.
B00000269M|5.0|This is the best follow up album ever. When an artist has an ablbum like \\"Thriller\\" and do so good it is hard to follow up and to make a good cd.This is my #2 favorite of Michael cd's. <br /> <br />1)Bad-********** ( 10 stars)  raw, bad ass <br />2)The Way You Make Me Feel- ********** ( 10 stars) sexy, sexy in the video <br />3)Speed Demon- ********** (10 stars) it doesn't get enough representing, no one plays that video. I think that it is a good video. <br />4)Liberian Girl- ************ ( 11 stars) one of the most unique songs that is on the album because of the music in the song <br />5)Just Good Friends- ********** ( 9 stars) a cute song <br />6)Just Another Part of Me- ********** (5 stars) it is very short in lyrics but it is a very good song, you can dance to it <br />7)Man in the Mirror- *********** (11 stars) one of the best songs on the album because it makes you want to get up and dance around and it could be a gosbel song <br />8)I Just Can't Stop Loving You- ********** (10 stars) sweet song, sounds cool in spanish on the special edition. <br />9)Dirty Diana- ********** (10 stars) very very raw song, very dirty <br />10)Smooth Criminal- ********** (10 stars) smooth song, you can hear his heart beat, sexy <br />11)Leave Me Alone- ********** (10 stars) good, good song. Close to Scream getting to be anger at the media.  <br />   <br />     This should be call the album to idolize because it is like great. Not a lot of people can do something so huge and do something like this. It shows that Michael is going to the best. He is the best and nobody can do anything like that
0375701427|5.0|The Levovs lived the American dream for two generations, building a glove factory in Newark, New Jersey that brought wealth and prosperity to the family.  When the next generation comes, the American dream changes.  The very prosperity that two generations had fought for was no longer important.  The freedoms that made America great were a side effect of a greater demon.    Swede Levov struggles with trying to grasp what went wrong with his daughter in \\"American Pastoral\\".  Was it mixing Jewish and Catholic parents?  Was he too idealistic?  Was it his wife's fault?  As a teenager, Swede's daughter Merry becomes vocally opposed to the Vietnam war.  Eventually, this opposition turns to a violence greater than Swede can grasp.  While Swede struggles to maintain his family, his daughter runs from the law seemingly attaching to any set of beliefs with stability.  When he finally meets his daughter again, she is withered away in the practice of Janism.      In the end, the author shows that Vietnam was not the only conflict of the times.  Social values, religion, and money were brought into question during this turbulent era.  The even greater conflict stems in social relationships and the burdens that they bear.  The same flaws we see in others are very present in ourselves in differing ways.    This is Philip Roth's Pulitzer Prize winning novel.  It is a wrenching yet staggering acheivement.  While it seems verbose as the reader struggles with Swede Levov to rationalize his thoughts, it does not detract from the big picture of the death of an idealism that once motivated post World War II America.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is truly an exceptional movie following an exceptional show. The storyline and characters have no competitors what so ever. I don't know what were the reasons to cancel the show, but there are plenty of reasons to get it restarted now. I truly hope that Joss Whedon somehow finds a way to continue with this project. Buy the DVD set and the movie. It'll leave you wanting more and make an instant fan out of anyone who watches them.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|After the break up of the Beatles John Lennon and Phil Spector took the master tapes of Let it Be and finished them into an album.  Paul has always wanted the album to be bare Rock and Roll without orchestration, and with nothing more than guitars and drums.  John and Phil Spector released the album that we all know and love, and the rest is history.  Paul McCartney after all these years decided to release it the way he wanted it.  To a certain extent there is a little charm to some of the songs in this format. The problem I have is that a song like the Long and Winding Road does not sound the same, infact it sounds hallow or unfinished.  From a technical stand point the album is very good and the guitar parts are very clear.  Some songs are better, for instance, One After 909 is better, as well as Get Back and I've Got a Feeling.  This is an album for a Beatles collector.........enjoy
B00000AFGM|4.0|With \\"Animals\\" Marilyn moved away from his more grindy/screamy hate-rock that was on Antichrist in favor of an androgenous \\"glam\\" look and more synth and samples. I'd also heard rumors that he'd gone to Japan and visited with Mana of Malice Mizer, some of his outfits would seem to show some Visual Kei influence (the hair, the wings, the dresses). The songs were also more somber, people called this Manson's \\"fit in pop album that even Grandma can listen to\\" but people who say that only scratch the surface and can't see beneath the packaging. The subject matter is still dark, but this time its about the dissapointments of love and popularity and not irresponsible hate and blindness through power. By far my fave song on the album is the Floydian \\"Speed of Pain.\\" Call me sappy, but it always makes me cry. \\"New Model\\" is also very Gary Numan-esque. The lyrics are more constructed, the sound is more constructed, the look is of a post-human, androgenous robot. The other albums were different, because Manson changes about the same way Madonna does. Don't expect him to stick with just ONE thing.
B000001EGE|5.0|Ok, when is someone going to admit this is Elton shown at his best? 'Might as well be me, i guess.  This shot is so attractive- very intense, introspective...and yes, mad sexy. Shameless adoration- this cover adorns my desktop right now.  By the way, the music is great too.  This album is a close runner-up to 'Captain Fantastic &...' for me. Rocket Man is stellar.
6304981635|5.0|If you wanna know bout Bruce Lee, his kung fu style, his cinematography, deails of the plot of the movie.. there are enough reviews out there to give you plenty of info I don't intend to repeat. However, take this thumbs up review from a chick who says ITS A MATTER OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE / CULTURE OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO KNOW, REVER AND OWN THIS MOVIE. Nuff from me.
B000002L99|5.0|There were expeculations and doubts on wether or not Van Halen could rise as survivors after the departure of rock`s greatest frontman,David Lee Roth.Van Halen managed to do so by making one of their best albums and starting with a new chapter in their super career as one of rock`s biggest monsters of all times.Sammy Hagar,ok,he`s not David Lee Roth,but DLR isn`t Sammy Hagar either.DLR was the voice of an era of partying,drinking,smoking and f@!#$ng and they were fabulous.SH was the voice of an era of loving,thinking,caring and fighting and they were fabulous too.Both eras have their own greatness,why?,because both were under the name of Van Halen. <br /> <br />\\"5150\\" is an album full of good songs from start to end.I can`t remember an album with more catchy songs than this one.The lyrics are very good and the band sound super cool.Sammy`s voice is up in the sky and the guitar solos are incredibles.\\"5150\\" brings some new experiments like Alex Van Halen electric drum kit and the keyboards in more than two songs.I personally don`t like keyboards and electric drums,but Eddie and Alex make them sound great.Michael Anthony found his peak in his backing vocals,excellent! <br /> <br />With songs like \\"Why Can`t This Be Love\\",\\"Dreams\\" and \\"Love Walks In\\",you can feel the new Van Halen coming out of a giant ball with rage.The formula:keyboards,new voice and positive messages.\\"Get Up\\" is like \\"Hot For Teacher\\" part 2.The guitars came to work too,because \\"Summer Nights\\"(MY FAVORITE),has one of the finest riffs you can imagine from Eddie Van Halen and the chorus is the best.\\"Best Of Both Worlds\\" is very similar to \\"Highway To Hell\\" from AC-DC but with less distortion.\\"Good Enough\\" take you to Van Halen`s trademark sound like \\"Panama\\",\\"Runaround\\" and \\"Ain`t Talkin``Bout Love\\".The title track,\\"5150\\" would have been a hit if they`ve made a video of it.Cool song!! <br /> <br />In resume,this is the begining of a new era that was as good as the albums in it.\\"5150\\" represent the fight of a champion that  is struggling to \\"Get Up\\" but finally makes it and wins with a surprising punch.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|I gave this movie two stars simply because of the special affects, which I was happy to see were kept to a minimum, and for the costumes. Other than that it was actually a waste of time. If you spend two hours doing something in your life you should do something that you can look back and and say, \\"hey, remember when we--?\\" But The Brothers Grimm is not one of those times. I actually fast forwarded it about 90 minutes into the film to watch the rest go jogging to the end. You can't blame the actors as some on the review board did, it's really not their fault. Blame the script writers and the lousy lines these people have to read.
6304602944|5.0|Tango and Cash is fantastic. The movie is one of the best buddy cop movies around with excellent action sequences and a funky musical score by Faltermeyer that endlessly plays in your head. <br /> <br />The story revolves around Stallone and Russel playing \\"Tango and Cash\\",two of LA's top cops who can't stand each other, but are framed and actually have to work together to clear their names.The action sequences are first rate and the sequence when they escape from jail is a knock out! The dialogue is funny and you will keep chuckling to yourself throughout the movie. Teri Hatcher as Stallone's sister is a great addition and Jack Palance as the whacky villain makes the movie a lot of fun. <br /> <br />The movie was a huge hit worldwide making some 200 million ( not including dvd and VHS, sales and rentals) and of course Stallone was the king of Holywood at the time.At this time, Stallone's box office power started to grow more overseas and Stallone's performance is refreshingly funny, irreverent and cool. It would be unfair to say that Stallone does not have a flair for comedy as this movie and another action comedy hit, \\"Demolition Man\\", prove that. <br /> <br />Kurt Russell more than holds his own against Stallone and is by all accounts a terrific actor. I really can't say who was better... I think both were equally good. I was also quite impressed with Kurt Rusell's physique. He looked amazing. <br /> <br />I am really surprised that Hollywood did not see the wisdom in making a sequel to this movie because who ever I talk to say they would love to see the dynamic duo again. What would be nice is if Stallone, Russell, Andrei Konchalovsky and the powers that be, got together and make a special collectors addition of the movie. It would sell, believe me!
0393316041|3.0|Richard P. Feynman, the author of the New York Times bestselling autobiography \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!,\\" is a truly intriguing person. This \\"curious character\\" of a physicist has had his share of adventures, from creating a make-shift science lab in his basement to speaking before such successful scientists as Albert Einstein to traveling to Japan and Brazil to continue his life-long learning experience. <br /> <br />But with so much potential for a great book, his writing falls short. After all, he is a physicist, and unfortunately his writing mimicks mathematical equations. Every story in this book, while containing interesting material, lacks in verbal creativity. He uses the same general format of storytelling substituted with new subject matter -- same equation, different variables. <br /> <br />That's not to say \\"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" is a complete wash. Feynman does manage to incorporate humor, and in small doses the book is good for a nice laugh now and again. His unique perspective on science and learning -- he is self-taught in many areas, and enjoys impressing others by applying scientific knowledge to everday routines -- is equally enjoyable. <br /> <br />But the lack of literary creativity means that the work stops short at just that: enjoyable in small doses, good for a laugh. Feynman's bland writing style certainly does not do his exciting life justice.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Wilco, Wiskeytown, Bright Eyes, and Ryan Adams. I have to hand it to these wonderful artists who choose to undertake the very difficult task of adding to the Folk/Country landscape of the American sound. It's hard to create a song that sounds fresh yet familiar at the same time. One that is intimate and emotional that invites you to look at the artist's soul and challenging enough to get you to look at your own. Folk, country, and blues all have very simple structure and lots of limits. Of course Adams is going to sound like a ton of others. But the nuances of difference, the variations of a common theme that is at the heart of a given genre is what make his music his own. Perhaps it's just me, but I don't expect Ryan Adams to be anyone other than himself on his albums--as schizophrenic, cheezy, or imitative the result might be. Still good music in my humble opinion. <br /> <br />Perhaps this is why I do not view Adams' (or his contemporaries work) as constantly missing the mark. I love this album. I also love Adams' Rock-n-roll album as well. It serves its' intended purpose--the artist's vision--and does not pander to the audience. I don't expect an artist to constantly sound the same, in fact I would prefer they challenge themselves (and my ears) with each new undertaking. (I'd even give Adams' a listen if he tried his hand at jazz or rap just to see his perspective on these genres.) Then again it's always nice to hear him come back from his journeys and incorporate what he's learned into that which he is most familiar with. That's how I view this album--a synthesis of his stretch on the Rock-n-Roll album and his previously demonstrated mastery of the alt. country sound. While others criticize this as undermining his genuineness in his work, I see it a testament to his artistic integrity. Others see his lyrics as trite or lacking finesse, but I see them as simply poetic and poignant.   <br /> <br />As a suggestion, check out Jackie Greene if you want to hear a \\"modern day Dylan\\". Awesome young cat from the Sacramento area. Just don't blame him when he chooses to switch up and rip out some amazing blues or traditional country. (Besides, Dylan was still alive and kicking last I heard, which would technically still make him the actual modern day Dylan.)
0307276902|5.0|Whether or not parts of this book are \\"fabricated\\" doesn't change the fact that it is a wonderful book that has touched many people. I personally think the amount of publicity regarding parts of the book that may have been elaborated makes more people want to read it. When I found out that there was some controversy, it did not change my opinion of the book at all - it was the same book I read before the controversy came out and I believe it deserves 5 stars both now and then.
0609610570|4.0|I enjoyed many of the concepts in this book, even though many of the ideas were not new to me.  I have given this book to my middle managers who are raving about it.
0553801503|2.0|My brother-in-law introduced this series to me 2 years ago.  I picked up A Game of Thrones and didn't emerge until I finished Storm of Swords.  I loved it!  I couldn't imagine how all you day one, die hard fans of Martin had managed to wait so long for the next installment.  My own anticipation was keen to say the least.  But, oh boy!...I threw A Feast for Crows down at one point and told my husband (and his brother) that I was done with Martin.  If I had to read one more chapter on Cersei I would gag!  There wasn't enough \\"good\\" character chapters to balance her out.  She is not even excitingly evil.  She is just despicable mixed with foolish.  Why can't Martin throw her out the moon door, too?  MAKE HER FLY!  I would be glad to shove.   Heck, maybe even throw this book out with her.  Okay, in all seriousness, I did finished the book.  It was tough but I feel it was for the greater good.  It had a few merits. Here's hoping for a better 5!  I haven't lost faith completely...
0316666343|3.0|i think this book is OKAY.  it's good . .but i agree with \\"don't believe the hype\\" review.  i hate to be negative but it's true, somewhere in the middle of the book the author went from fabulous to mediocre.  i stayed in it b/c it was so promising. the story line had a chance to be told really well.  i mean, the story is a li'l quirky but i bought into it anyway.  there were moments where the storytelling just really went backwards. i got frustrated b/c some parts were just not written well. i had to re-read some parts b/c the story wasn't being told well.  the author lost me b/c the writing style got lazy and the quality diminished. despite that, i finished it . . so, go figure.
B0007P3582|1.0|This collection of rhymes is repellant,  at best.  The sampling is as deplorable as are the sexist lyrics.  This type of music although leaves me happy for one right:  The freedom to crack the disc.  I gave this rubbish a chance.  Not a good ambassador for this genre of music.
1573223026|3.0|I'd have to say that, compared with some of his other work, this book wasn't Hornby's best at all. I'd still give it a good review though, for being thoughtful if not quite as philosophically satisfying as some reviews/synopses I'd seen had made it out to be. So I was a little disappointed but the book was a pleasant read and gave me a decent amount of smiles and even chuckles in its better moments. The major peeve I had with it though, was the JJ character, who is supposed to be American but speaks and narrates with a bit too much British affect--perhaps Hornby needed to be a little more acquainted with American slang instead...
B000099T2L|2.0|The compositions are rather moderate here.  The sampling of Summer's \\"Love To Love You\\" is well done.  That's it.  I can only give those kudos to this LP.  It is listenable,  whatever that means.  Perhaps if Knowles would attempt to sing,  instead of sounding as if her vocals were being forced through cotton.  I simply do not understand the \\"biz\\" on her voice.  Now,  having said that:  a good voice is NOT necessary to create great pop music,  but this attempt just falls short.  It's not good.  I tell you,  it's not good.  Perhaps another vocalist,  then,  yes I would love this LP.
0553801503|5.0|Sometimes I think that Jordan fans come to Martin reviews just to bash, and vice versa.  I can't believe that anyone who has read the previous books in the series doesn't love this one. <br /> <br />I suppose this review was written as a counter to the less-than-stellar reviews that precede it.  I believe the series is headed in EXACTLY the right direction, and truly gets better with every installment.  I read some of the reviews here prior to reading A Feast for Crows, and it worried me.  If you are on the fence, do yourself a favor and read it for yourself.   <br /> <br />Though I had my reservations when I learned which characters would and would not be covered by this volume, I found that this was one of the best of the series.  If you are afraid it won't be the same without Jon or Dany, rest assured that the replacement point-of-views will satisfy.  Believe it or not, I'm now worried that the next volume, with no Brienne, Sam, or Iron Island chapters, will feel lacking! <br /> <br />Maybe other reviewers here have problems with this volume because they were only in it for the body count.  If you only enjoy the series for the deaths of major characters, you may indeed be disappointed.  Just don't think for a second that nothing important happens; the groundwork for some SERIOUS world-shaking (and character shaking) events do occur throughout the book.  Also, rest assured that this book is pretty grisly, with the same visceral fight scenes and gruesome disfigurements that are a hallmark of the series. <br /> <br />I have discovered that I just love the world Mr. Martin has created. I personally find the details about the characters and the world they live in, to include the seemingly inconsequential minutiae of heraldry and history, to be infinitely fascinating and worth reading.  In fact, worth reading again and again so as not to miss the brilliantly laid clues, hints, and easter eggs found throughout the series so far.   <br /> <br />In short, if you have everfound yourself trying to construct a timeline of Westeros, or taking notes on the knights of the Kingsguard so you don't get them confused, or furiously flipping back to a prophecy from a previous book because you think it just came true, this is the book for you.  Come on, you know who you are!  Just read it! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|i obviously listened to the reunion concert for what it was supposed to be,A BLOODY REUNION CONCERT,after 37 years or so what do some of you guys think you are going to see or hear,these guys are pushing towards 70 years old.listen to the music and you will here a few lazy notes or mistimed ones but for a band with 3 musicians only and no session artists hiding in the dark background,these guys are a credit to themselves and the cream legend,back in the late sixties i was in a 3 man band,we did  some cream numbers in our shed that we practised in and the sound filled in nicely,take that sound out onto a stage and o boy how thin and weak it sounds,unless you are a proficent and talented band like cream,the sound on this reunion concert is superb and full of dynamics that some of you have obviously no idea about,sure they play a few songs a little slower ,hell at their age i hope i can still walk to the loo by myself.if you want to take a cheap shot at musicians try listening to a lot of the crap bands today with their mega watt systems and not a lot of talent,as ive heard one old rocker say in an interview a lot of the bands these days arent that good but their loud.now thats somthing they can hang there reputation on isnt it\\"NOT\\" <br />and for those of you who have never played an instrument in a band you would have no idea how much energy it saps out of you ,so instead of critising just for the sake of a cheap shot wake up and  listen to this concert for what it was intented, <br />fresh cream,maybe not, but still 3 of the most talented musicians of their time
B000A6CLL0|5.0|ENTERPRISE seems to invoke either high praise or harsh critique. I really like ENT and have trouble understanding why its own fans destroyed this fantastic series. <br />The 3.Season ranks as one of the best, along with Season 4. And no doubt would have gotten better if only been given a fair chance. <br />It has a suspense ongoing storyline, strong characters and a purpose. The last 7 episodes starting with AZATI PRIME and finally culminating in ZERO HOUR keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time and makes you hunger for more. <br />For me ENT is clearly the highest ranking series in the franchise, along with VOY and DS9. The highly praised TNG was boring me to tears most of the time. Don't get me wrong I like Picard and his crew, but if I had to choose I would pick ENT everytime. I can watched any ENT episode over and over before I start TNG again.  <br />The DVD set itself is what you come to expect from Paramount. The case is more beautiful than any of the other series and I have them all. And with ENT we finally get to see some bloopers, although they become shorter as the series comes to an end. <br />If you like Sci-Fi, drama, suspense and a darker setting,BUY it. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JNQA|3.0|Interpreter is a suspense thriller about the brutality of African politics, an assassination plot, and an UN interpreter who overhears an incriminating clue. For two suspenseful hours, the investigation is just a half-step behind the forces of darkness in fulfilling their mission. Chasing down every lead, the federal agents may not succeed in protecting the target: President of a small African country torn by internal dissension.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman does a beautiful job portraying the interpreter. Sean Penn becomes the Secret Service agent assigned to protect the foreign dignitary and investigating the UN interpreter. A good movie which overperforms driven by top star performances.
0064471837|4.0|\\"Sabriel\\" surprised me. The beginning started of tense and mysterious, very interesting, but then it bogged down a bit in description and backstory and I was afraid I'd managed to pick up yet another in a long line of bad fantasy books. But once the narrative picked up pace again, it didn't stop. There was more than enough suspense and good characters to keep me turning pages long into the night.<br /><br />Sabriel herself exists in two worlds. She's spent most of her life at a boarding school for young ladies in Ancelstierre, a country that has technology equivalent to 1917 or 18 in our world. However, across a heavily defended border wall, lies the Old Kingdom, where Sabriel was born and where magic rules. No technology will work there, in fact it will break down into its component parts if it gets too far in to the Kingdom. Magic holds sway, and in increasing numbers, so too do the Dead.<br /><br />It's not quite zombies, but it is the walking dead in various deadly incarnations, and when Sabriel goes in search of her missing father, Abhorsen, a necromancer of sorts (as she is one herself; his legacy to her) she finds herself having to fight against animated rotting corpses. Then running for her life as far worse things pick up her trail. She may have talent in crossing the border between the living and Death, laying spirits to rest, but she's not quite up to her father's skills. Not yet, anyway. And there's something out there controlling all the Dead, setting them after Sabriel, something she'll have to be much stronger to face or risk the same fate she's beginning to fear has taken her father.<br /><br />This is a well written book with characters I could take an interest in, truly come to care about. From Sabriel herself to the mysterious Touchstone whom she rescues from Death, to my personal favorite, Mogget the cat. Or something that closely resembles a cat. But Mogget has its secrets, the same as everyone else. And like all the rest, that secret is deadly.<br /><br />The Old Kingdom is a place of constant danger and death. Where death isn't always permanent and you can still be enslaved long after life has left you. Some things about this story are truly scary, and I liked that.<br /><br />As I said before, the pace gets a bit slow near the beginning, but push through that and the rest of the story reads fast. There isn't much said about Ancelstierre, which I thought could've been more developed as a country so different from the Old Kingdom, but it's not really all that noticeable once you get caught up in the story. The only other bump in the narrative is the switching points of view, an easy writing trap I was a bit disappointed the author fell into. There's no need to leave Sabriel's point of view to move the story. It would've gone just fine without direct input from other characters' minds.<br /><br />None of that is enough to detract badly from the story, though, (just enough to stop me from giving it five stars) and even if they do throw you out of the narrative on occasion, it's easy to get drawn back in. This is definitely a book I'd recommend to people.eadly. <br /> <br />The Old Kingdom is a place of constant danger and death. Where death isn't always permanent and you can still be enslaved long after life has left you. Some things about this story are truly scary, and I liked that. <br /> <br />As I said before, the pace gets a bit slow near the beginning, but push through that and the rest of the story reads fast.

B0001L3MI0|1.0|This is the worst piece of patriotic nonsense I have ever seen in my entire life. Not to mention having more plot holes than swiss cheese. A computer virus??!? C'mon.<br /><br />Would someone in Hollywood please actually write a somewhat logical first-encounter movie where the aliens aren't humanlike and don't use Windows or Macintosh compatible computers and fly spaceships that could have been designed by the Air Force in about 20 years? And while you're at it, come up with some dialogue that doesn't insult our intelligence over and over and over again.<br /><br />Oh wait, I guess that would be \\"Contact.\\"
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Even if you don't like this music, you would have to agree that Sufjan Stevens is highly original. It may be too orchestrated, but is not ever the top motown Phil Spector like. <br /> <br />There is a smorgasbord of different instruments of sounds, but still the album sounds like 1 whole piece. There are soundscapes that could be part of movies, especially opening scenes, but also small acoustic songs.  <br /> <br />From looking at the songtitles it is clear that the album is about the state of Illinois. Great songs like Chicago (though maybe a little too christian-rock orientated) or Decatur are stories about places in the the state. Much like Built To Spill less-than-two minutes masterpiece 'Twin Falls, Idaho'. <br /> <br />He also sings about the people from that state, and he does that best in 'Gacy' about the massmurderer, even trying to explain he actions somewhat.  <br /> <br />It's a very light album, in the sense that like many concept/theme albums are bombastic, this one is not.  <br /> <br />It is not easy to name influences, and that makes him very original. There is some Cure, Elliot Smith, Belle & Sebastian, Will Oldham and a lot of folk, he sounds a little like Donovan sometimes.  <br /> <br />Because of the pure brilliance of the album I can see through the sometimes too many christian references. Maybe it's his Holland, MI background. It can be a little annoying, but then just don't listen to the lyrics and only to the music. For me however it's the reason why it gets only 4 stars, instead of 5. There is a certain looking-down-the-nose morality and that's a little too much. I am not passing judgement on someone else however, it's just something I! have trouble with. <br /> <br />But overall, it's an unique album and well worth getting.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Ah, me. I'm not one of those folks who self-identify with little fandom groups with weird names--Trekkies and furries and whatnot. I liked FIREFLY: liked it a lot. Thought the world of it and really really really wanted more than the scant 14 episodes we got. <br /> <br />I was in Moscow--the one in Russia--on a business trip with nothing to do (it gets cold in Moscow at night). I'm wandering the hotel and see the sign for the American Movie night. The poster is in Cyrillic and has some metal clad chick with an axe. Hey, wait... that Cyrillic says \\"Serenity\\". <br /> <br />I was alone. I mean utterly alone in the makeshift theatre. With no one to tell about this film. It was... an epiphany. No, it isn't perfect. Boy does it have some warts (I didn't much buy the trip to the dead planet in the middle), but mostly this movie is alive, breaking rules and breaking a fan's heart. So much what, say, SITH was not. Joss Whedon does not tip is hat to the fans. Not at all. Neither does he \\"reboot\\" the series, starting over at the beginning. And you don't see things coming. <br /> <br />I walked out a Browncoat with nobody to tell. It was (mostly) magic. A ticket to a science fiction world you've glimpsed maybe here and there. And here you are in it. <br /> <br />The reviews (I scoured them) were downright weird: 4 star reviews that duck at the end and say \\"well, you know if you like this kind of stuff\\" (as if it must be washed off).  <br /> <br />What does FIREFLY/SERENITY have to do to get noticed (so that the money guys will give us another fix)? I don't know. As I write this, though, the DVD is #4 in sales on Amazon. Somewhere, someway, under the radar, a lot of folks are finding it. Singing the weird-as-get-out theme song. Ain't no power in the 'verse can stop that. <br /> <br />Dang.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|I am of mixed minds on Dune, because I think the movie itself feels like two different movies. The first half is a marvelous set-up. It's filled with incredible details and wonderful visuals. It takes its time to effectively set the stage for what is to follow.<br /><br />On the other hand, the second half of the film is rushed. Things happen too quickly, without enough detail. And the hack of using technlogy rather than fighting style to train the Fremen is nonsense. (And I won't even go into the very silly final minute of the film.)<br /><br />I still enjoy the film because there is so much that is good in it. But at the same time, I'm dissapointed that the second half didn't live up to the promise of the first.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a more than a film, certainly much more than a \\"gay film\\".  It is one of the saddest and most profound emotional experiences that you will ever encounter in a movie theatre.  The tragic love story between two soulmates is brilliantly realized by Ang Lee, and the performances are flawless.  Both Jake and Heath are remarkable.  Everything blends beautifully in this powerful story----the script, the direction, the cinematograhy, the scoring, and the performances of the entire cast.  The painful story of these two men caught in circumstances they cannot control, and the resulting tragedy is like nothing else I've seen in recent years.
0783226845|1.0|I seem to be in the minority that absolutely hated this movie.<br /><br />Not necessarily because of the performances, although Al Pachino's Oscar for this was a pretty obvious case of giving the award to a fine actor who is often nominated, but never wins. This was not his finest performance.  Instead of giving the nuanced performance of which we all know he is capable, Pachino sinks into the over the top schtick that's common among successful actors that are phoning it in.  He's not acting, he's yelling.<br /><br />Chris O'Donnell gives a fine performance, although nothing that stands out.<br /><br />The majority of the movie involves the young Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) shepparding Pachino's blind Col. Frank Slade arround as he intimidates the young boy into accompanying him on a last hurrah before he heads home to kill himself.  Most of the memorable scenes from the movie come from this section, but mostly it's setting up a bond between the tired old warhorse and the young impressionable kid who admires his ability to live large despite his disability.  Amusing, but not remarkable beyond Pachino's annoyingly over the top performance.<br /><br />What was truely horrible about this movie was the appalling message it sends-Chris O'Donnell's character, Charlie, is a nice kid who is put in the impossible position of either sniching on classmates who pull a nasty, hurtful prank and leave him to take the fall, or turning them in and having to deal with the fallout.  And the adults around him, who should be supporting him so he is able to do the right thing, either browbeat and threaten him (eg. the principal-deliberately made unsympathetic in order to support the take home message), or in the case of Col. Slade actively defending him for not turning them in.  And holding this up as an example of the epitome of HONOR.<br /><br />The only more dishonorable thing he could have done would have been to actively participate in the prank and then go out and kick some puppies.<br /><br />I don't expect a lot of moral sophistication from Hollywood movies.  And I usually enjoy movies that explore moral ambiguities or deficiencies.  But the way that this movie not only tolerates, but beats us over the head with the message that we are somehow supposed to admire this behavior is much more offensive to me than senseless violence or explicit porn.puppies.   <br /> <br />I don't expect a lot of moral sophistication from Hollywood movies.

B000002H4C|4.0|There's only one thing as cool as seeing this movie at midnight in the right state of mind, and that's this soundtrack. Even without the connection to the film, the tracklist is awesome. Included is the great title song from Sammy Hagar, the odd-but-cool cover from Devo, a huge hit from Journey, and killer tunes from Blue Oyster Cult, Don Felder, Sabbath (with Dio), and the beautiful Stevie Nicks. If the 70's were your decade, this is your soundtrack. Sure, by todays standards this might not be considered metal, but it is classic, it is heavy, and it does rock!
B000001A3R|5.0|This album is the essence of simple hard, riff-heavy rock, call it `stoner rock' if you will - whatever genre - this will raise the hairs on the back of your neck in a style only the rock gods in the olden days could. This was my first Kyuss album and remains my favourite after going through their discography (which, isn't really much of a feat, it is tragically small). The album's structure is of three pieces, each containing at least three songs, almost creating a medley. At first this structure frustrated me, it wasn't that accessible if I wanted to listen to a part of each long piece, but overall it creates a flow to the album, almost giving it three `movements' each representing different ideas and musically diverse.<br /><br />The first piece kicks of with `Gardenia' through a powerful muddy, down-tuned riff which progresses through different variations until Garcia's vocals kick in. His voice is brutally raw yet melodic at the same time. I've read some reviewers complaining about his lack of variation, but to me his voice is just perfect, complementing the heavy old-school guitars. `Gardenia' is a mighty opening blow, full of crunching riffs that engulf the listener in a thick haze of distortion. `Asteroid' is a superb instrumental, something Kyuss like to throw into thei albums. It's somewhat progressive in style, built around a simple theme with some mighty crescendos thanks to Homme's advanced song structuring.<br /><br />`Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoopa' and `100 degrees' are typical Kyuss rockers, great riffs and melodies. `Space Cadet' then follows halfway through piece two, and what a tremendous surprise it is, an utterly beautiful moving ballad. The guitar playing is amongst the finest on the album and Garcia's vocals are, I would argue, diverse to the usual delivery - soft and tender. The piece washes over in its seven-minute entirety almost too quickly, fortunately though it leads into my other favourite of the album, the driving `Demon Cleaner'. On this one Garcia's vocals have a dreamy aspect to them, recalling the tripped out desert feel. Along with Homme's relentless riffing, this song is simply stunning.<br /><br />Piece three is probably my least favourite out of the three, but is still a thundering tour-de-force of riffs and melodies. `Odyssey' is one of the most aggressive, confrontational pieces on the album, highlighted by Garcia's overwhelming delivery, launching himself into the lines `once you return from the belly of the beast/ you're never quite the same'. `Whitewater' is a fine way to close the album, a personal highlight for me. It slowly builds to a monumental riff.<br /><br />This album is quite simply powerful, `listen without distraction' it says in the liner notes, I wouldn't worry about that, this is truly engulfing stuff. For fans of old school rock and metal, and fans of metal in general, try this band immediately.s vocals have a dreamy aspect to them, recalling the tripped out desert feel.

0812548094|4.0|This book is long and slow reading compared to the 1st. Mostly because of the amount of new character developement done in this book.  However it is definatly worth the read, and gets better near the end.
B00097DX3U|3.0|Audioslave's self-titled debut was heavy rocking; it was a thunderous album full of monumental riffs and stunning Cornell banshee screams. It also had a lovely subtler side to it, highlighted by some solid ballads. So I had high hopes.<br /><br />`Out Of Exile' was certainly hyped; in various interviews the band seemed most happy with their work, especially Cornell. So I was expecting more of the beastly rocking and the subtler ballad style that seemed to work so nicely.<br /><br />Instead the band hit a kind of middle ground, there are still heavy moments with great riffs, and Morello's soloing may even be better here, but the ballads are weak and simply too often. The rocking sections don't always rock, and the quieter sections leave me wanting more. `Your Time Has Come' is a great opener, after putting the cd in and hearing this, I was already questioning the negative reviews. Then the title track just goes past with its ok hooks, never at any point does it grab my attention, it doesn't have any powerful playing, and it doesn't have any subtle playing. Its just a middle ground rock song. Same applies for the next two tracks, `Be Yourself' becomes very monotonous after a few spins. `Heaven's Dead' is just a slow burning ballad that doesn't burn anything.<br /><br />On the upside (apart from the opener), `Drown Me Slowly' has great energy and the band really seem to connect here. Cornell's vocals complement the raging guitar playing with the panache found on their debut.  `The Worm', while being very simplistic is just a brutal hard-hitter. Cornell's `HALO' screaming is most ravishing. `Man Or Animal', similar story to `Drown Me Slowly', Audioslave laying out the hard rock in style. `Yesterday To Tomorrow' is the only half-decent slow song here, very much a Metallica ballad in sound, but in a good way, the vocal and guitar arrangements are good enough to keep my attention and actually make me enjoy a slower moment, as opposed to pushing the skip button.<br /><br />So, this is a mixed bag to be concise. The rocking moments are good at times, and generally I dislike the ballads. The style of the debut is seemingly lost here, instead of trying to create a `rock classic', I'd much rather see Audioslave lay off the balladry and pummel me with their amazing ability to create power. 3 stars, worth a listen.r /> <br />So, this is a mixed bag to be concise.

0393327655|3.0|A book like this needed to be written in our world today. Unfortunately, this isn't the book that needed to be written.     Harris touches on many of the reasons why we need a book like this, including broad issues (not just faith based terror, there's also faith driven violence and intense social coercion inside the U.S.) and some of the roots for that (the way comments about faith end conversations, so beliefs remain unexamined; and how we are expected to treat all beliefs with equal tolerance and credibility).     As it is, it stops being useful in advancing the conversation because of the absolute insistence on \\"reason\\" as he defines it as the only test, and the underlying axe that Harris seems extremely intent about grinding. Maybe Harris' reasoning leads him to the inescapable conclusion that there's no place for religion in the modern world, but it would help to avoid acting omniscient, and be willing to do a more even handed job of looking at various perspectives.     Dismissing religion as the misguided consolation of idiots and madmen just isn't going to advance the conversation. Equally importantly, an overemphasis on logic shows a rather one dimensional approach to the discussion.     There are lots of things we have theories about, for which the theories are not currently testable by science (like super string theory). There's room for philosophy in our world - but it does need to be discussed and examined. Also, recognize that most of us believe several impossible things before breakfast each day.     Also, it would help to separate out which things are really being done for the sake of religion and which are being done for power and money - whether we're discussing the Crusades or Supreme Court nominees.     Harris should have set aside his absolutist views, and put more emphasis on how to get society to have conversations about what works, in building a life and a culture, and what doesn't work (those unexamined things that we can't seem to discuss today, like how Islamic societies have failed their people).

B00005JOFO|5.0|Finally, the Golden Globe awards allowed a local movie house (hungry for cash) to step outside of narrow-minded convention and show this great film. Such lust for cash was the only way I had the opportunity to see 'Brokeback Mountain'! Brokeback is a great movie which has inspired my purchase of the short story.  Both Ledger and Gyllenhaal gave superb performances.  You could actually feel the longing and misery of those two 'cowboys' doomed to live a lie. I will definitely purchase the DVD when it is released.  Two thumbs up!!!!
B0002858YS|5.0|This album should be considered one of the best album releases within the past five years. It has a sound for everyone with an ear for good music. It combines electronic, with 80s, with new age rock. Some people compare this band to Franz Ferdinand or Modest Mouse, but The Killers seem to have an essence and sound all their own. Sometimes I have bought an album for the hit single or several for that matter, which I did for this one, but found myself very pleased with the purchase as a whole. You will not get bored. This is an album that is well worth the money. Each song keeps you listening and gets you hooked. Believe me.....I was hooked for weeks on end. Hot Fuss is right. This album is indeed hot, and there should be quite a fuss about it. Purchase this album and you won't be disappointed. I would rank it in my top 10 cds that I listen to. From the old to the new, The Killers give you hope that their is different and intriguing music out there.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|Ive been listening to Punk/Emo for a long long time, and honestly Ive never heard anything like Panic! at the Disco before. There style is unique to punk unlike most bands... who are essentially doing the same thing as everyone else.  Hmm many people complain about Brendon Urie sounding identical to Fall Out Boy's vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump's... which is definately not true... This band is not another Fall Out Boy, i assure.  Dont get me wrong Fall Out Boy is OK but not amazing.  Panic! at the Disco Composes a nice blend of techno/punk/pop... which for the sounds amazing, especially some of the intros to the songs.  While their debut album \\"A Fever You Cant Sweat Out\\" is amazing for the most part, with the exception of a few songs... Ive never liked techno but i must admit PATD incorporates the style into their tracks well. Introduction and Intermission arent exactly hit single's but their just their to complete the album... As for the others here's my scoop on what is exactly is worth listening to on the cd and what needs some work... I dont do 15's outta 10... Im straight up with my ratings, 10 being amazing. <br /> <br />Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage: 8.5/10 - Although this song isnt a great example of PATD's techno aspect until about the end of the track, its still a great song and really grabs your attention as the CD opens up.  The song earns it 's 8.5/10 towards the end when you hear the real PATD. <br /> <br />London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines: 6.5/10 - Good song but weak in many ways. Lyrics not very unique or very catchy.... Ending not very strong in my opinion. <br /> <br />Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks: 6.5/10 - This song caught me at first but as i listened it just lost my attention very quickly, sound is not very original but does represent a chill kinda song, maybe trying to relax the listener after two faster paced songs. Good sense of techno though. <br /> <br />Camisado: 7/10 - I have mixed feelings about this song. Its very up and down in terms of good and bad... I love how It starts fast and just slows down immediately to pick up again... A nice song but it almost becomes annoying in the middle of the track, with its high fast paced loud beats. Starts to get better towards the end and has a very unique sound, but then comes the annoying beats again... its a decent song though. <br /> <br />Time to Dance: 10/10 - Wow... This has got to be PATD's masterpiece and should have been their first single, instead of \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\"... Starts off with a great essence of techno and nice beats and just picks up tremendously with kick ass lyrics and a great sound with techno and punk mixed gorgeously. I guarentee you in the shower youll be singing \\"when i say \\"shotgun \\" you say \\"wedding\\"... \\"shotgun!\\", \\"wedding!\\", \\"shotgun!\\", \\"wedding!\\"...\\" Great job PATD! <br /> <br />Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off: 7.5/10 - Great lyrics and awesome beginning, very nice beats which go well with the vocals. It randomly picks up with louder and more direct lyrics which is somewhat nice because without it the song would be bland. Odd ending but kinda interesting... All and all is a good song. <br /> <br />But It's Better If You Do: 5/10 - Not a song Im to happy with or enjoy listening to... its just to plain with dumb lyrics and definately is just a filler for the cd... Didnt seem to have a lot of effort put into it. Will get you bobbing your head but thats about it. <br /> <br />I Write Sins Not Tragedies: 9/10 - PATD's first single and probably best known song due to TRL and Last Call with Carson Daily... Excellent song with fun lyrics that are easy to learn and sing along with, very up tempo and just a great listen with unique sounds that will leave you satisifed. <br /> <br />I Constantly Thank God for Esteban: 8/10 - I like this song alot... its fast paced with intersting lyrics. You gotta give it a chance because itdidnt stick at first for me but its attached now and i find myself listening to it alot. <br /> <br />There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't: 6/10 - Odd lyrics but has an interesting sound... pretty fast paced but lacks the energy of some of the better songs but i must admit the music is pretty kool, the lyrics just fall short... <br /> <br />Build God, Then We'll Talk: 7.5/10 - Pretty good song, awesome beginning but slows down lyrically and musically for a while in the middle of the song, but it does pick up near the ending to give the song its decent rating... Not a great closer to the album though. <br /> <br />All in all the album has a very unique feeling and sound, which could be extraordinary... \\"A Fever You Cant Sweat Out\\" is astounding but lacks the energy and lyrics on a couple songs... Id really give this album a 4.5 star rating.  I think the album should have opened with \\"I constantly thank god for esteban\\" and ended with \\"camisado\\"... which may have made the lyrics a little more meaningful... Hope this review helped ya! :P

B000BJ7BCA|4.0|It is always a struggle to find a movie at the video store for \\"family movie night\\" that both of my elementary school daughters will enjoy and I will, if not enjoy, be able to tolerate.  I have certainly appreciated the effort that many studios have made to make kids' films more enjoyable for parents.  When my younger daughter chose \\"Sky High,\\" I was not terribly optimistic, but Disney actually did a pretty good job making it sort of fun for this GenXer.  More importantly, the younger crowd LOVED it.<br /><br />Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), the son of two superheroes, Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston), is about to start high school.  Will is not going to just any high school.  As the son of superheroes, he will go to Sky High, where he will follow in is parent's footsteps.  However, Will has a secret.  He does not have any super powers, so he is relegated to classes for \\"Sidekick's,\\" and that is obviously a disappointment to his famous father.  At Sky High, Will must deal with everything a \\"normal\\" kid must face while growing up, but, through a series of typically teen-age blunders, discovers he must also face his parents' greatest nemesis, Royal Pain (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).  The future of Sky High and of the entire world depends on Will.<br /><br />Disney used a lot of great tricks to transcend the generational gap in \\"Sky High.\\"  For GenY, some of the costumes, acting, and special effects were very much reminiscent of the wildly popular, live-action, Saturday morning television show, \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\\"  What boy born after 1978 was not secretly in love with the Pink Power Ranger portrayed by Amy Jo Johnson?  (Confession: When my little sister watched \\"Power Rangers\\" a couple of decades ago, I was sort of into the Pink Power Ranger myself!)  Royal Pain's costume, body movements, secret hideout, and general evil demeanor are a dead-ringer for \\"Power Rangers\\" genre.  For Gen X, a wonderful little trick that I had not seen before, although I have to imagine it has already been employed, is the use of classic, coming-of-age anthems, like, among others, \\"I Melt The World,\\" \\"Save It For Later,\\" \\"Voices Carry,\\" \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World,\\" \\"And She Was,\\" but had them recorded by contemporary artists.  Heck, I think the entire soundtrack is comprised of `80's remakes.  (I still think The Talking Heads' version of \\"And She Was\\" is superior to that of Keaton Simons, but what would a six-year old care?)  For both Baby Boomers and some early GenXers, the casting of Kurt Russell is sort of an interesting bookend to Russell's Disney career.  I remember going with my parents to local single screen cinema to see Disney's \\"The Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes\\" and \\"The World's Strongest Man\\" with Kurt Russell playing the teen-age lead.  Appearances by the original television \\"Superwoman,\\" Linda Carter, as well as \\"Kids in the Hall,\\" Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald go a long way to make \\"Sky High\\" ironically humorous for the adult audience.  Nicely done.<br /><br />A film completely appropriate for the younger crowd with just a little cartoonish violence, \\"Sky High\\" is a thumb's up for both kids and parents.  This is the kind of movie that made Disney what Disney was.  If we see more \\"Sky High's,\\" Disney will very soon once again become the entertainment powerhouse it used to be.have to imagine it has already been employed, is the use of classic, coming-of-age anthems, like, among others, \\"I Melt The World,\\" \\"Save It For Later,\\" \\"Voices Carry,\\" \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World,\\" \\"And She Was,\\" but had them recorded by contemporary artists.

B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of my top ten favorite animes. Simply breathtaking. I almost wish for a sequel, but we all know how those turn out. The story is of a boy who after a battle with a evil demon is infected and cursed to die a slow death with will kill him and consume his soul in the process. Fighting alongside of the wolf princess he tries to right the wrongings of Iron Town. A town that has raped the land to the point that the forest spirits are to wage war on the humans. It a great anime and I highly suggest the purchase of it for any anime collector.
B00005JOII|4.0|Match Point, in many ways, doesn't feel like a Woody Allen film.  For one thing, there is no \\"Woody Allen\\" character - no nebbish comic hero.  It doesn't take place in New York, but rather in London.  In fact, there's only one American character in the film, and that's Nola, played by Scarlett Johansson.  Although there are funny moments, this isn't a comedy at all - it's about the choices people make and just how far they will go to get what they want.  What does feel like a Woody Allen film is how the characters are able and willing to describe exactly how they feel at a given moment and engage in philosophical conversations at the drop of a hat. <br /> <br />The story concerns Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Myers), a good-looking, ambitious, young tennis-pro.  One of his rich clients takes a liking to him and introduces him to his sister, Chloe.  Soon, the whole family has taken a liking to him and young Chris goes from a poor tennis instructor to being a rich businessman.  There's only one problem - he's in lust with his brother-in-law's fiance.  Eventually, they take up a relationship.  One of the nice things about the film is how ambiguous everything is.  When Chris has to choose between Nola and Chloe, the choice isn't obvious.  Certainly, he is more attracted to Nola, but that could be just lust.  He does seem to love his wife. <br /> <br />Woody works well with his young cast.  Nothing in the film feels false.  In fact, it feels like a British picture.  London looks great as the young, beautiful people make their way through their luxury apartments.   <br />
0399236201|3.0|Like any other action based novel, the storyline flows very well. The suspense and action will definitly leave readers on the tip of their chairs.    However, I found the lack of character development very disapointing.     Alex is a 14-year old - who's uncle has been murdered - and still he manages to be so calm about the whole ordeal. It's just unrealistic to have a 14 year old - stay so calm in his first mission with only several weeks of training. I was also disapointed that there was no special insight into Alex's character other than his abilities and skills.     It's clichd, but it's fun to read because of the action.    I recommend this book to action lovers. However, if you want developed characters, don't go near this book.
B000024C7W|5.0|As bassist Jeff Berlin said, Stevie Wonder is one of the five or six most important and creative musicians of the 20th century. The Secret Life of Plants ices it. Weirdly, The Secret Life of Plants is one of Stevie Wonder's most hard-to-find records. I rate it as his best. One way to describe this record is Duke Ellington writing about trees, bugs and venus fly traps. As a synthesist (ie. synthesizer player), on these albums Stevie Wonder brings the instrument probably as far as it has ever gone as a human, expressive instrument. But always his voice, acoustic piano, drums and bass and found ambient sounds meld with electronic textures to create something nobody had ever done before and people have been copying ever since. Secret Life of Plants has some of his best singing as well, freed from trying to get a \\"hit.\\" In my opinion, this sound cycle is one of the most important recordings of any genre made in the 20th century. Why all the gushing? My dad was a tree cutter and landscaper and taught me all the scientific names of every tree in Massachusetts by the time I was 15. So all of the stuff about trees here is true.  They are oldest and longest living creatures on Earth and are what humans were born under. Stevie Wonder does a beautiful job with this theme and for me it resonates very deeply.
078681859X|4.0|Would you ever want to go somewhere magical? Then this book is for you. Based in soggy London town, this place seems pretty boring, right? Wrong. Full of magical wonders, whereabouts, and wizards, `The Amulet of Samarkand is a must read on anyone's list. <br /> <br /> 12-year-old Nathaniel is training to become a magician. But, summoning up a 5000 year old djinni won't help him progress any further. Nathaniel gives the djinni, Bartimaeus, an excruciating task. He must fetch the Amulet of Samarkand. An amulet so powerful, it could take out any magician in the blink of an eye. Even Simon Lovelace, one of the most powerful magicians in the world. <br /> <br /> One of the characters I like to most is Simon Lovelace. He doesn't have such a big part in the story, (or so what I have read,) but he is mysterious. He was once the owner of the Amulet; but once Bartimaeus got a hold of it, it is now Nathaniel's. <br />  <br /> What I like most about the book is the drama in it. One of the characters, Nathaniel, reminds me of me. I say this because  Nathaniel is mysterious and funny.  <br /> I give this book two thumbs up. Back in the 5th grade, I was inspired by a friend to buy this book. I got bored of it, because I really didn't understand the content in the book. But, now that I am in middle school, I understand more of the content inside of the book. <br /> <br /> Recommended for children ages 12 - 15. Full of twists and turns, you'll always be too eager to turn the page. <br />
B000059T1E|4.0|Just one correction.  The official review above mentions the title tune vocal as being one of Winwood's best but Jim Capaldi handles the lead for most of the song with Winwood singing harmony on the choruses.  I was privileged to see this tour and the highpoint of the show, for me, was this ancient song performed with acoustic guitar, tambourine and flute to a quiet crowd in the middle of a rock concert.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Overall this is a pretty good follow up to the band's self titled debut.  If it is not as strong, it does seem to be building a solid foundation for their third release.  Franz Ferdinand has shown themselves to have the talent and attitude to pull off something special, and if this is not it, at least it beats a good portion of what is currently their compititon (i.e. Interpol, Bloc Party, Kaiser Cheifs, etc.).  Until 2007....
0553801503|4.0|Whereas, Martin's writing in itself, was just as honest as before, I felt as though I read 700+ pages and discovered that nothing--nothing--nothing! was resolved.  The story went no where.  The only thing I felt was gained was a deeper insight into Jamie.  He truly was a deluded soul. He believed so strongly in his nutso sister and was so completely entralled by her that he became blind to all else, even common morals. The reader begins to feel sorry for him, even though he attempts to gather inner strength.<br /><br />What drove me the most crazy about this installment, other than the fact that many of my favorite characters were glaringly absent, was the fact that Martin decided to leave the reader with HUGE cliffhangers.  You really have no idea if some of these characters are dead or alive.  In previous books (I believe the second one it was) he told the reader in the end that little Bran survived, but here, well, I guess we'll have to wait a year or so to find out.  Hopefully, it won't be more than that.<br /><br />Over all, still a wonderful read, I only took off one star for the problems listed above.  After all, if Martin want's to make sure to make a killing on his next, he most certainly accomplished that.  I possitively on pins and needles waiting.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Though beautifully shot and ably acted, there is too much story in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to fit into 2 hours. The film skimps on the relationship between Elizabeth and her father, and flattens the differences between the sisters until they are nearly indistinguishable. Mister Collins, the fusty pastor, is only marginally dull; fiendish Mr. Wickham seems incapable of guile; Lydia Bennet insufficiently silly. The movie gives us little background to appreciate the country-vs-city issues, such as why Darcy and Miss Bingley considered walking so bizarre a mode of transport. And not for a moment did I consider Keira Knightley as someone who could be taken as plain-looking.<br /><br />The sets are quite splendid, however. Even the Bennet's \\"poor\\" country manor, for all its faded and peeling glory, is rendered with great detail. The sountrack however, was so loud and lush and hardworking that it bordered on clich&eacute; -- when it wasn't actually masking important dialog. So much of the film is hurried, with machine-gun dialog that I could not understand. And compensatory touches -- like providing the characters with different outfits or outsized personalities -- were ignored for some reason, perhaps to focus more on the main characters. If so, this was a huge mistake. The charm of P&P is the interplay between the book's many characters and the norms that governed them. To streamline the characters and plot is to take away the story's soul.<br /><br />And no amount of loud music can make up for that.<br /><br />I highly recommend the 1995 miniseries, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. It's more than twice as long as this movie, but has to be.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I bought this dvd to get their new song \\"no more cloudy days\\". What I got was a whole lot more. The songs are great. It was recorded with multiple cameras, so the video keeps moving, and the camera always cuts to where the action is, ie guitar solo etc. The quality and sound is great too. I just thought the Eagles had a few good songs over the decades, but after having this video,I see they've had lots of great songs. Best of all, their live recording sounds just like the original recorded hits. Many groups just don't sound the same in live concert,they do. After buying this dvd, I've ordered many other live concerts, but this is simply the best! p.s. I'm an Eagle fan now, I can't wait to see them in live concert when they appear nearby. <br />
B000AYEIL8|2.0|I strongly disagree with the positive reviews on this site and with the people who list Leolo as one of the best movies ever made.  I found it to be depressing and pointless.  It is not enough to keep saying I dream, I dream, I dream.  The hell with that.  It is artsy nonsense as it leads us from one depressing scene to another.  This film, and the reaction to it, shows me that if you say something very trite over and over again, and wallow in mud for two hours, there will be a lot of people wallowing with you and praising your artistry.<br /><br />You have the older brother of Leolo, the cowardly older brother who lifts weights to gain a very impressive physique, and then backs down and cries once again when his childhood bully bullies him once again.<br /><br />You have the insane grandfather who tries to drown Leolo for splashing in the pool, and the reverse scene where Leolo tries to hang his grandfather with a noose.  What idiocy.<br /><br />You have no end of filth, excrement and squalor.  You have sexuality turned filthy.  If that's your idea of art, I really have to question your taste.<br /><br />I'm not objecting to the filth.  I'm objecting to the emptiness, the lack of artistry, the substitution of filth for art.  If you think filth alone, misery alone, are valuable works of art, you will love this one.<br /><br />However, it makes no sense at all, and is full of trite nonsense about I dream, I dream, whatever.  It is high art for the tasteless.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|He was a man who was in need of an inspiration and they were a family who were in need of a fatherly figure, someone who would care for them.  It was a chance encounter and it was the one that created Peter Pan.  Inspired by true events, this story tells of J.M. Barrie, a famous playwritght, who was losing his creativity until he met the Lewellin family, a mother with four children who lost her husband to a jaw cancer.  She herself is not well and is often overcome by convulsive coughs.  Her family is falling apart, particularly Peter (the second youngest of the four) who has not been the same since his father's death and who is constantly concerned for his mother's health.  J.M Barrie brings life back into their family and hope while they, in turn inspire him to write a play that he will most be remembered for.  Underneath the main plot, J.M Barrie is also strugling with his failing marriage as he spends more and more time with the Lewellin family and eventually, his wife leaves him.  The only thing that seems to keep him afloat is Neverland, a place he created in his mind while a child.  He passes on that dream and hope to the Lewellin family as well.       It is a beautifully written story with wonderful acting by Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, and the kids.  It's a love story of different kind, an inspiring story that is both sad and happy.  It truly is a jewel and a must see, for it is never too late to get in touch with your inner kid again.
B000301YY8|4.0|Wow!! Such powerful yet meaningful lyrics! I love this album. I hate that it is so short 39 mins. James Blunt definitely is a great new artist! I am so glad I bought his cd, because it was worth every dollar I paid for it. It takes a couple of listens to get into the lyrics of the song but they are all great. He has such a great voice! I cant stop listening to it. It is that amazing! Buy It you wont be sorry you did!
B0009S3HI0|3.0|I have to say, Deftones is one of my favorite bands EVER.  No one can do what they do.  They defy all the rules of rock and come out with something totally unique every time they pick up their instruments.  However, I was highly dissappointed with the CD part of this compilation.  I WILL ADMIT THAT I AM BIASED, HOWEVER.  The Cure, The Smiths, and Duran Duran are not my favorite artists, so it's really hard for me to like covers of their songs.  I kept flipping track to track trying to find some good old hard Deftones songs.  Couldn't find one.  The acoustic versions of Change and Be Quiet and Drive are excellent. <br /> <br />The DVD with this album is AMAZING!!!!!! I would suggest getting this album just for the DVD.  It has all their videos, including \\"Bloody Cape\\" which was never relased as a video, except for ONE FREAKING DAY on their website.  The DVD also features videos of the band playing shows in their earliest days in California. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great CD for anyone who is already a Deftones fan.  This is not, however the first CD a new fan should get.
0140067477|4.0|Most books with the word \\"Tao\\" in their title have nothing to do with the Tao. THE TAO OF POOH actually explores the Tao and its finer points in a simple and delightful way. Hoff shows a deep understanding of ancient Taoist principles and presents them in the nurturing environment of A.A.Milne's classic WINNIE-THE-POOH. Very creative, and a fine introduction to the teachings of Lao Tzu. Of benefit to readers of all ages.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|This is a great \\"chick flick\\" movie, one I've watched many times already.<br /><br />When I first watched it, the film brought back painful memories. I can see how my mother, who came from a family of career women (although typical \\"female\\" professions such as School Teacher and Nurse), was frustrated at being shoved into the box of housewife and mother. She was never happy in that role, and after seeing this movie, I can see what tremendous pressure women were under back in the 1950's to conform. When she got married, my mother gave up a job she enjoyed because my father and society expected her to do so.<br /><br />My mother did not get a college education because my grandfather did not think it was worth educating girls; her brother got the college education. Seeing these bright college girls in the movie was sad, because you knew almost all of them would never use what they learned.<br /><br />I went to college in the 1970's and was still getting ribbed by older men as getting my \\"MRS\\" Degree, snicker, snicker. I never found that joke funny and I still don't. This movie gives the origin of that attitude that still is prevalent today. A college educated woman is still not worth what a college educated man is; otherwise, women's salaries would be on equal par with men's in all professions.<br /><br />The superb costumes and hairstyles reflect the period and were historically accurate, except Julia Roberts' hair seemed a bit too contemporary at times. Yes, she was portrayed as a Bohemian Feminist from California, but her hair and makeup lacked that fifties Bohemian look. (Note Audrey Hepburn's Hair and Makeup in 1957's \\"Funny Face.\\")<br /><br /> The soundtrack was also excellent, reflecting the time period and popular music of the 1950's.<br /><br />I would LOVE to see a sequel, featuring all the same characters 10-11 years later, around 1963-64. That was such a turbulent year, and I'd love to see how these characters were affected by the political changes and climate of that time.hanges and climate of that time.
B000000W6X|5.0|i like how the people who wrote negative reviews, did so in the year 2005. this album was released in '94. back in those days this album was excellent, with tracy singing in the right key and all! more than one can say for portishead. yeah, of course newer chill albums are going to sound better and fresher. if you spend all day listening to bt, then yeah, kraftwerk is going to sound a bit boring. does that mean that kraftwerk's albums sucked? NO!  hell NO!
037571457X|5.0|This is a graphic novel that everyone should read.  Marjane Satrapi was only 10 years old when the Islamic Revolution occurred in Iran.  Through simple but powerful pictures and prose, she details what it was like for her to grow up in Iran during that timeframe.  She is taught rebellion by her parents who opposed the Islamic regime and consequently as a teenager she wants to listen to the forbidden music of Kim Wilde, Iron Maiden, and Michael Jackson- even though she knows the penalty for being caught listening to it is severe.  She has to hide behind the veil in public but looks for ways to rebel, including painting her fingernails and wearing hidden jewelry.  Satrapi maintains a sense of humor throughout many portions of the book, including one memorable scene where her father tells the veil-enforcing teacher that the teacher needs to shave her mustache if a female's hair is so stimulating!  However, long after I read this book the first time, one scene haunted me in particular.  Early in the book, a massacre occurs when everyone in a theater is locked in to die while the theater burns to the ground. I think what makes this book particularly powerful to me is that the author is only 1 year older than me and it is only when I compare my life from ages 10-14 with her life that I realize just how much she had to endure.  Highly recommended to all!
0765309408|5.0|Old Man's War is Starship Troopers without teen angst, without the militaristic proselytizing (although the philosophizing in ST was amongst the best parts of the book, forget the horrid movie), with much more humor and with David Brin's concept of humans fighting for their survival in a universe with a multitude of hostile creatures (Startide Rising, Uplift War).   <br /> <br />The concept is simple: if you are 75, would you leave Earth, never to return, and fight for humanity amongst the stars for up to 10 years among the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF) in the face of a 70% mortality rate, in exchange for physical restoration to youthful status, and the ability at the end of your service to settle upon a human colony at the physical age of 25, thereby giving you a second adulthood?  Protagonist John Perry would, and did.   <br /> <br />OMW is essentially the memoir of Perry's first year or so with the Colonial Defense Forces, from leaving Earth as a 75-year old widower with his son and grandchild left behind, to joining the ranks, to accepting a new physique and mindset, to becoming a leader within the CDF.  It deals with aging, rejuvenation, heroism, war with aliens and alien first contacts with humor, swift plotting and no small amount of empathy.  The plot devices are similar to Ender's Game, The Forever War and Starship Troopers -- strange aliens attacking humanity, humans seeking to colonize the stars, otherworldly technology that allows humans to \\"move\\" faster than light-speed, super biological enhancements, etc., but in Scalzi's universe war is not dependent upon inability to understand the aliens (Ender's Game, Forever War), but instead stems from both competition for habitable worlds and the presence of aliens who see humans as a food source. <br /> <br />Scalzi's aliens are diverse and intriguing, from animal-like creatures to inch-high humanoids to nasty slime; but none are more interesting than the Consu, insectoid zealots who are like Heinlein's Bugs and Card's Buggers but who can communicate with humans, believe in a Klingon version of Buddhism (reaching Nirvana through combat), have a Borg-like worldview and have a strange affinity for their victims. <br /> <br />Some very good stuff with action, humor, philosophical introspection and more packed into a short, fast book.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Obviously Ghost In The Shell Innocence is no doubt one of the best films of the year but why is it getting so many bad reviews? Because this DVD is an insult to fans and this should have never been released so unfinished. There are no special features, nothing you would expect to get come in this DVD so your basically paying a bunch of cash just for the film and you get nothing else.<br /><br />Some people don't like to read subtitles and some don't care but watching this film with subtitles makes it seem too long and boring so it's obvious they should have put in some extra effort and made English audio with the actors from the series. I have watched plenty of anime and other films with subtitles and had no problem reading them but G.I.T.S innocence is really a movie that needs English audio. Hearing Batou's voice from the stand-alone complex would have been more exciting and edgy.<br /><br />Besides that the film is amazing, the animation is so realistic and sharp that if someone walked in and started watching they would swear you were watching a real life movie. The story is sharp and creative plus there's a little surprise that will make fans happy. At first I wasn't sure if Batou was going to be able to hold this film together but he sure did give a heck of a performance. He's no Major but he packs a mean punch and his gunplay is sick. The movie is fine and it is a sure classic it's worth it for the animation alone but as hard working paying fans people should know this is one of the crappiest DVD's you could ever buy so I suggest to buy it when it is on sale or in a discount store.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have seen this movie a few times now and have enjoyed every single viewing. There are many people who have a problem with this movie being environmentalist, something I really have no problem about, though I am not one my-self though I do hold many conservative values.  <br /> <br />But my point is I'm not rating this movie according to the message it's trying to send out. I'm rating it according to what I thought of the story, the voice performance, and character development, all of which I thought were superb. <br /> <br />There are also those who would call this a silly childish plot, and to that I deny. The fact that there are talking animals is completely irrelevant. The plot revolves around a situation of warring civilizations and the extermination of races. Not exactly the kind of tape you pop in for the kids. 800-page fantasy novels have been written involving animals blessed with human qualities and millions of ADULTS read them, I mean don't be ridiculous calling this a kid's plot. <br /> <br />In short, this was a terrific movie, and that's coming from someone who rarely thinks this highly about any movie he watches. <br />

0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\" will likely prove to be a challenging if not daunting read for novices, but lovers of the literary novel genre who are experienced in navigating complex thematic artifices and structures, should simply trust their instincts and dive straight in, for there's gold in this magnificent chinese box of six tenuously interrelated, tantalizing vignettes. I'm sure Mitchell wouldn't approve...but I took the unconventional path of taking each of the short stories in turn, completing the reading cycle for one before proceeding to the next, in order to reduce the burden of remembering names and other plot details of six completely disparate tales contemporaneously.     The six stories are individually set in different times, different locations and told using voices and narrative styles that are couldn't be more different. Yet there is a clear integrity and an unmistakeable cohesion in the novel's overall contruct. Though the stories are linked by the thinnest of threads from incidental plot details running through the story chain, thematically they bleed into one another and congeal seamlessly to produce a kaleidoscope of images showing the history of man's inhumanity to man from past through present and into the future. Mitchell's clarion call for humankind to take heed or perish reaches its climax in the cataclysmic, futuristic sixth story and that's the toughest one to navigate through `cos it's narrated in dialect.     Adam Ewing's sojourn through the Pacific bears more than a passing resemblence to Matthew Kneale's classic \\"English Passengers\\" while Robert Frobisher's tale of deceit is deliciously comical. The pace quickens with Luisa Rey's heartstopping escapades, surely the stuff of Hollywood movies. Timothy Cavendish's plight is both social commentary as well as black comedy. Next we find ourselves in Hermit Kingdom where robots yearn to become human beings once they've tasted the forbidden fruit. Different as each of them is from one another, they're all gems and I love them unreservedly and unequivocally.      Mitchell is a genius and \\"Cloud Atlas\\" an astounding literary achievement.  Criminally, it made the shortlist for several book prizes in 2004 but walked away with none that mattered. Never mind, it's a wide and enduring readership that counts and it's heartening to note that after more than 12 months after its original publication, its Amazon sales ranking in the UK is still at a healthy triple digit level. Quite clearly, the reader knows best.

B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel's \\"Greatest Hits Vol. 1-2\\" showcases what I believe to be the best part of his career. It is during this time that he released such classics as \\"Piano Man\\", \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\", \\"Uptown Girl\\", \\"It's Still Rock and Roll To Me\\", \\"Big Shot\\", and \\"You May Be Right\\", in addition to others. Billy Joel is one of the greatest musicians and songwriters ever and this compilation is a good representation of some of his finest work.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Looking at the front cover of Porco Rosso I automatically thought that the animation will a little old and foggy so I hesitated to buy it. I am ashamed of myself for judging the anime by its cover because this film has some of the most beautiful animation I've ever seen. Porco starts the film with his pig head so you will have to watch the film to find out how he got this curse. It is said Porco Rosso is one of Miyazaki's oddest films but the only thing odd in this is Porcos head.<br /><br />One of the biggest influences for Miyazaki creating this film was his love and obsession for planes. He shows off his love with this cursed ex military pilot turned bounty hunter who is just trying to live out the rest of his life while having absolute joy in tracking down pirates and getting paid to do it. Even though Porco is cursed with this head many for his heroic act in the military love him.<br /><br />Someone who just wants to be able to say I took out the legend but Porco is far from dead has shot down his plane. He takes his plane to Italy for repairs but trouble is still on him as his home Italy wants him for abandoning the military. He finds a young girl there that is an amazing designer and she makes Porco a plane even better than what he had. The two become partener and the rest is history.<br /><br />Porco tries to play the hard bounty hunter but he still gets love and respect let it be from a group of schoolgirls he saved to a young woman who always worries about his safety. He uses his big pig head a lot  but he also has a bigger heart that he puts to even more use. This is a film that you will not forget after you see it and it will make you want to buy everything that is Miyazaki. The ending could have been done better as you are left with questions that were only partially answered but I guess they weren't meant to be fully answered.
B000002UVX|5.0|This has to be the best live perfomance every to be recorded, not only from Jimi, but from any musician. Of course, I am a huge Hendrix fan, yet I happen to like Band Of Gypsys better then the Experience..Its just to bad that Jimi died shorty after this was recorded. WOrth the price of the album alone is the best recording of Machine Gun that you will ever hear, not to mention that this is one non stop Jam..DIG this, you will like this album even if you dont like Hendrix..Its not popular, it doesnt have any well known songs on it (expect to Hendrix fans) but give it a try..ENJOY
B00005UEAR|4.0|This is my first foray into Dream Theater's music. As a kid I was enamored with Tool, Staind, U2, Pink Floyd, and Coldplay, but found all of the bands to be lacking... something. Even after years of theory, I couldn't put my finger on it. Well, I think I've found it. DT has a lot of the something I was looking for, and this CD has mesmerising melody, annihilating drums, and technical and compositional skill all over the place. <br /> <br />That being said, nothing is perfect, this CD not excepted. <br /> <br />1.) The first two tracks are a bit too long and overblown, and don't make very good of dynamics. The repetitive thuds on Glass Prison get on my nerves at times. <br /> <br />2.) The lyrics are too hard to hear on my headphones!!!! GAH! It's the 21st century, fix it!!!! <br /> <br />3.) The accidentals in Glass Prison and Disappear don't always work, sounding off-key and misplaced on the synth especially. <br /> <br />4.) The lyrics to Disappear suck, hands down, like a bad movie soundtrack. <br /> <br />5.) The Test that Stumped Them All is too good to exist. OK, that's not bad but I had to toss it in here :)
B00005KFUM|5.0|This highly underrated album is without question one of the best of the last ten years.  Although its popularity pales in comparison to that of its successor, \\"Absolution\\", the same cannot be said of its quality.  Every track on this album is adventurous and all are successful in their brave endeavors.  This musical journey through hard rock, art rock, new synth, and even opera-inspired pieces will wow you from start to finish.  An absolute must in any modern rock collection.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|The acting is quite good.  Everybody, including the little girl, do a superb acting job. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can say about this film.  I can't even think of who WOULD like this film.  It tries to be scary, but it isn't.  It tries to be smart, but it isn't.  There is no tension and the only part with a little bit of suspense was just weird. <br /> <br />The Ring was great!  The Grudge was okay.  But this addaption of a Nakata film really missed the mark.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I thought this was the funniest movie I've seen in the longest time.  Usually I sit through \\"funny,\\" movies with a straight face and nary a snicker.  I had just drank a large gulp of my diet Coke when the sex scene popped up and I just about choked on my drink I was laughing so hard.  Parker and Stone even topped Mel Brooks flatulent cowboys with a scene of the hero blowing chunks in an alley for so long, that I went from laughing, to being slightly bored, to laughing all over again.  This made the recent conceit that their TV show, \\"South Park,\\" was a conservative show making fun of liberals, into total nonsense.  No one was safe from a good sharp barb.  Macho Hollywood movies, liberal movie personalities, conservatives who seem to want constant warfare and be thanked for it were all sent up.  The closing theme song sounds like it should be played at football games, with it's vulgar patriotism, although it would probably offend some self-proclaimed patriots.  Toby Keith, are you listening? Maybe karoke bars will fill in instead.  I actually do remember the old TV show \\"Thunderbird,\\" but was always somehow bored with it as a kid, but I too was reminded of this show while watching this movie <br /> <br />My particular favorite character was the officer in charge of Team America, who never seemed to let go of his martini glass, even when he was being blown apart with explosives, and other dangerous \\"devices.\\"
078322737X|3.0|Just FYI the \\"High School Reunion collection\\" version of American Graffiti is just a repackage of '98 version..  Boxart on reverse shows 2003 copywrite but the dvd inside carries a '98 date..and quality of dvd transfer is definitly of that vintage..also prices at wholesale clubs now down below $5..new version must be around the corner??
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Man, what can you say about Jimi that has not already been said. He's been called a genius, an insane lunatic, and he's been called the greatest guitarist ever to play by Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page, and many others. He could hit more notes per second that anybody else. Hendrix was the only guy that I knew of that could that could be playin', miss a note, keep playin' and make something absolutly beautiful.      Despite all of what I just said, Hendrix only managed to get one hit in the states, a cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the watchtower\\" off of his \\"Electric Ladyland\\" album which went to #20 on Billboards Pop Singles Chart in 1968. I don't know if one day people woke up, heard \\"Hey Joe\\" playin' and said to themslves \\"man, we f***** up on this guy cause he was something special.\\" I don't know if that's what happened because I always liked him. But anyway, Hendrix is now liked by just about every fan of classic rock and this CD has his most well-known music and some you don't hear that often. You can hear \\"Purple Haze\\", \\"Foxey Lady\\", \\"Hey Joe\\" on just about any classic rock station in America, so that had to be on here. But this CD contains some great songs that you don't hear alot. \\"Manic Depression\\", \\"If 6 was 9\\", \\"Stone Free\\" are all great songs that showcase some of Jimi's greatest guitar work and every one of them is on this album. The only song that is missing is \\"Hear My Train Comin.\\" That is one of my favorites and I think that it should be here, but other than that, this is a wonderful CD that I would suggest to any fan of great rock.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a great album! I had expected it to be more punk, but it isn't. That doesn't change the fact that I have heard it non-stop for a week now, and I'm still not bored with it. Actually it becomes better the more you hear it.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|I have listened to all of Deva Premal and Miten's CDs daily for the past two years. Dakshina is simply the best! I put it on first thing in the morning following meditation and listen to it for hours. She touches the depths of my Being. Track 4 brings tears frequently, as it pulls my heartstrings in gratitude for the One in all. Patiently anticipating her next masterpiece!
0515125024|4.0|I picked this book up on a plane from a friendly neighbor. I had no idea what I was going to read. I found the title inticing. I was immediately immersed and this is the first of the Jack Reacher stories that I read. I have read all but one and still find this the best one. So unlike the other reviewers who refer to Killing Floor as the best one as they had read it first, I believe this is it. I just finished Killing Floor and I really think Die Trying was so much better and had the character of Jack Reacher so well rounded up. After so many of Reacher's adventures, I noticed the tiny details that changed -i.e. he is always called Reacher and in this one, he is sometimes referred to as Jack. <br /> <br />All in all I am hooked to Reacher and wish there were more -because when I start, I cannot stop reading and read until 3am. And I am a big Hitchcock fan -and only find the mysteries and thrillers fascinating that I cannot figure out. <br /> <br />Keep going, Lee! <br /> <br />Thank you for the entertainment. What a great character you created. <br /> <br />
0393327655|5.0|Harris here makes the case that literal belief in ancient myths is doing the world more harm than good, a fact any sane person should be able to appreciate in light of the 911 attacks. When someone sincerely believes they're doing the will of God, there is no horror or atrocity that can't or won't be used towards that will. <br /> <br />Many might think that fundamentalist Islam is the only religion to fear, but Harris credibly argues that any religious belief system, including our comparitively tame modern version of Christianity, can easily lead to fanaticism that could spell the end of free society, and possibly society period. As proof, consider that if the most hardcore elements of the american Christian Right were to have their way in this country, all homosexuals would be in danger of imprisonment just for having consensual sex, any sexually explicit content on television or internet would be illegal, millions of young women would be facing prison terms for having an embryo the size of an almond removed from their bodies, and the scientific establishment would have to rewrite just about every textbook in at least the fields of biology, astronomy, geology, physics, and anthropology so as to make them conform to the ridiculous biblical notion that the Earth and the human species are 6,000 years old. This is not an exaggeration, this is what they actually want (ok, the textbook thing is a bit exaggerated, but not all that much!) -- because they're convinced their \\"God\\" wills it. Religious fundamentalism inexorably leads to severe loss of freedoms, which is frankly downright un-American. <br /> <br />Finally, because I feel it necessary to confront fundamentalist perversions of logic and fact whenever I encounter them, I must address the previous comment that claimed Christianity provided the basis for the ending of slavery. It has always amused me the many times I've come across Christians uttering this patently nonsensical claim, but it has also frustrated me as I have realized just how great the self-delusion must be that these people are under to believe something so backwards. The level of rationalization the typical Christian must engage in in order to make sense of certain aspects of their theology is gargantuan enough, but the level of rationalization necessary to convince oneself that not only was the biblical God opposed to slavery from the very beginning, but that he was ultimately the real reason slavery was finally abolished, is truly too staggering to contemplate. <br /> <br />But let's allow the Bible to speak for itself on the matter of slavery, it happens to be rather uncharacteristically clear and consistent on the subject: <br /> <br />Leviticus 25:45-46 (Old Testament) <br />\\"You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.\\" [Wow, how's that for equality! But I thought all of us were made in the \\"image of God\\" and therefore have basic rights and dignity endowed by him? Oh, well.] <br /> <br />Exodus 21:2 (Old Testament) <br />\\"If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, `I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.\\" [Honestly, I'm not making this up. It's right there in the \\"Good\\" Book! But wait, there's more!] <br /> <br />Exodus 21:20-21 (Old Testament) <br />\\"If a male or female slave is beaten and dies, the owner must be punished. If the slave recovers after a couple of days, however, then the owner should not be punished, since the slave is the owner's property.\\" [So, not only can we own slaves, but we can also beat them to within an inch of their lives. We have a truly great God!] <br /> <br />1 Peter 2:18 (New Testament) <br />\\"You who are slaves must accept the authority of your masters. Do whatever they tell you--not only if they are kind and reasonable, but even if they are harsh.\\" [Wait a minute, I thought we were morally justified in overthrowing the oppressive slavery in the south against the resistance of the slave owners. Does that mean the Confederacy troops were the \\"good guys\\" in the Civil War after all?] <br /> <br />Titus 2:9 (New Testament) <br />\\"Slaves must obey their masters and do their best to please them. They must not talk back.\\" [I guess a slave fighting for his freedom is out of the question then?] <br /> <br />Ephesians 6:5 (New Testament) <br />\\"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.\\" [Ok, ok, so a slave should serve his owner just as he would serve God himself? Should the slave make burnt offerings to the owner as well? The vibe I'm getting here is that slave ownership is next to Godliness.] <br /> <br />And that's just a taste of the pro-slavery biblical barbarism. I haven't even presented the verses allowing the selling of your daughter into slavery and the use of virgin females captured in war as sex slaves, but this should be enough to make the point that anyone who honestly believes that this religion is responsible for the abolition of slavery should have his or her brain chemicals checked for proper neurotransmitter balance. <br /> <br />But no one should be the least bit surprised that twisted, perverted logic such as this gets peddled by otherwise bright people who unfortunately believe that a multi-thousand-year-old book of confused myths, written by desert-dwelling barbarians of the distant past, is the divinely inspired bedrock of human morality. The obvious reason Harris wrote his book is to nudge people into re-examining their beliefs in the interest of the future of the entire human race. Can we really survive in the age of doomsday weapons when we have scores of people on the planet who believe in horrifically primitive ancient scriptures which promote cruelty, intolerance, and barbarism -- and which have virtually no relevance to modern life? Isn't it time we put the stories away and finally grow up?
B000000OF6|5.0|Queen is my all time favorite band, I almost never get tired of them. They cover all different types of music, if you like hard rock, they've written hard rock songs, if you like mellow rock, they've written mellow rock songs, if you like songs that are inbetween both of those, they have those too. This set of greatest hits contains all of their great songs, so it's a good starting point if you're new to the band, since it doesn't have any of their experimental mess ups. Here are my favorites: <br />Bohemian Rhapsody:An absolute classic that blends all different types of rock. <br />Another One Bites the Dust:Awesome beat, it's impossible not to move while listening to that song. <br />Don't Stop Me Now: One of their less well known songs, but one of their greatest. <br />We Will Rock You:Arousing, a great song. <br />We Are the Champions:Classic, no other words can describe it. <br />Radio Ga Ga:Amazing lyrics, kick*ss beat. <br />I Want it All: Great hard rock. It actually became a rallying song for Black African Youth in South Africa during their civil rights movement. <br />Who Wants to Live Forever:Great, sad, mellow rock. <br />Invisible Man: Wild and eccentric. Awesome guitar solos. <br />The Show Must Go On:Sad, emotional, and awesome. <br />If you like bands such as Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and the Who, I'd reccomend this band for you.
0385510438|5.0|I found this to be a very enjoyable book, filled with the tapestry of times gone by, both the innocent and the guilty, a fairly seemless story of a young man coming of age, an horrific crime, and resolution.<br /><br />There can't be a more oppositional place for Willie Traynor to settle in then Clanton, Mississippi around the time of desegregation. Syracuse University educated you can just see Bubba and Cooter, second cousins, sitting in front of the General Store when Willie (then just Will) rides into downtown Clanton, long hair and all, in his Triumph Spitfire, talking about that 'damncommiejunkieliberalcatholicdeeeeeegenerate' who takes a job at the dying newspaper as a cub reporter.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham is patient and takes his time creating a sentimental (OK, occasionally too sugary) journey for Traynor, funny, sad, and insightful, draping it over a horrific crime of rape and murder that rocked the small town.<br /><br />I admire Grisham, like Lehane and Parker, because they all have a successful formula and yet are unwilling to stay with something safe. Profitable but not very creative.<br /><br />So with \\"Painted House\\" and \\"Bleachers\\" Mr. Grisham steps out and tests the water. And I believe with \\"Last Juror,\\" he combines his sharp trial narrative with a gentler view of life in the South.<br /><br />I have to be honest with you. Being a Vietnam Vet, Grisham's (Willie's) editorial against the Vietnam War in 1971 brought tears to my eyes. His relationship with Miss Callie is warm and tender and courageous, and his stuttering outrage at the Parole Board Hearing for Danny Padgitt is profound.<br /><br />Very good book. Nicely hung together. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B000BYA5GO|4.0|From start to finish this film packs a semi-sweet .40 caliber punch. Nicholas Cage portrays the character of Yuri Orlov, a man who's come from nothing and took his younger brother with him. The film's dark comedy tones, not only deal with the morality of dealing guns to some of the world's worst people but the addictions that plague us all and the wars we all face, world-wide, and personal. You'll laugh almost the entire way through, yet hate yourself at times for doing it. A powerful performance, a great film, and a must-see. Best of all, it's a true story.
B00009UW0N|1.0|Released at the same time as Dawn of the Dead. I would pick Dawn of the Dead over Halloween any day! The mask of William Shatner on Michael (The Shape) Myers face looks like he just came back from a Star Trek Convention! I recommend HELLRAISER instead over this piece of tripe! We have such sights to show you...
0307276902|4.0|I am a professional in the field of counseling and addiction. I read this book with fascination and horror but ultimately respect for its raw portrayal of addiction. I am dismayed by all the controversy surrounding the accuracy of certain events in the book. My clients who are currently in treatment have found some hope in this book because they relate to the realities of the addiction Frey so vividly portrays. Whether or not every single detail of the book is accurate, I believe the essence of living with an addiction is still there. Until you have walked through his shoes -- whether they be expensive or not -- don't pretend to know what he is writing about and trying to convey about his life. Excellent read!!
0446691437|4.0|I've tried many different books on creativity and the practical aspects of creating, but none of them seemed to have a voice that worked for me. Most were too flowery, and others tried to psychoanalyze it too much. Finally, after reading Gates of Fire, I tried this book and found exactly what I needed. This is tough talk on what it is to create, but also what it is to struggle and succeed. Pressfield's perspective of \\"resistance\\" being the force that prevents creativity and progress is unique. His cure for resistance is not unique, and not for someone who can't look at themselves critically, but it's dead on. I liken it to what The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People would have been like if the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket had written it.
0553801503|4.0|I am amazed by George R. R. Martin. Yes, this is a weaker book than the others but it is only half of the book, the rest will come. He is just amazing with his characters, they are fascinating. I thoroughly  enjoyed this book, read it slow and easy and can't wait for the next!!!
B000002MIB|3.0|In 1993, at the height of grunge and alternative rock, Van Halen released yet another multi-platinum CD with their first ever live album \\"Live: Right Here, Right Now.\\" Compiled from various shows between 1988 and 1993, \\"Live: Right Here, Right Now,\\" focuses mainly on the Sammy Hagar era of the band and Van Hagar's first three albums \\"5150,\\" (1986) \\"OU812,\\" (1988) and most notably \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" (1991). Hagar's renditions of a couple Roth-era songs, a WHO cover, a few Sammy Hagar songs, and a few instrumentals round-out the album.<br /><br />\\"Live: Right Here, Right Now\\" has a lot going for it. Many of these live renditions sound fuller than the studio versions, especially songs from \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812.\\" Hagar's monologues, although at times long-winded, are generally interesting, especially his speech about living in the moment in the middle of \\"Panama.\\"  The instrumentals are more hit-or-miss. And there are A LOT of instrumentals; a drum solo, a guitar solo, and a bass solo. If you're into that sort of thing you will be well pleased with this release. But if you don't care for long instrumentals and solos, you may find them tedious. A cover of the WHO's \\"Won't get fooled again,\\" sounds good, an obvious choice it may be.<br /><br />The biggest drawback of this release is that it focuses exclusively on the Sammy Hagar-era of the band. It would have been far more desirable to have two CDs, the first covering '78-84 shows, (with Roth) and the second covering the Hagar era. But because the Van Halen brothers have always tried to downplay the Roth years and make Van Hagar out to be the definitive Van Halen (see \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\") we get a double-album of the Red Rocker without any Diamond Dave. When the band plays Roth-era material, it sounds good, until the vocals come in. As much as I like Sammy, he never could pull-off singing the Dave songs. While Hagar doesn't butcher the Roth songs, they just sound goofy, i.e. \\"got my ass against the record machine\\"(Hagar's replacement, Gary Cherone, did a terrific job singing all three eras on Van Halen's 1998 World Tour). Another problem with \\"Live: Right Here, Right Now\\" is that there are too many songs from \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.\\" Even if this had to be a Hagar-only live album, more songs from \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812\\" should have been included.<br /><br />While \\"Live: Right Here, Right Now\\" isn't exactly KISS \\"ALIVE,\\" (1975) it's still a pretty good album. While casual fans are advised to stay away, VH fans, especially fans of Van Hagar will enjoy this release. Hopefully someday an official Roth-era live VH album will see the light of day.'s replacement, Gary Cherone, did a terrific job singing all three eras on Van Halen's 1998 World Tour).

0765309408|5.0|Picked this up at the library, read it through within 36 hours. It is the kind of sci-fi that just pulls you in and makes you finish the book. There are several good synopsis above so I will just add that in addition to a good plot, I laughed out loud more a few times and there were a few sad parts that were written well. Not groundbreaking but a good story that that leaves you wanting more.
B0000029AL|3.0|3.5 Stars<br /><br />With the possible exception of KISS and later Van Halen, no other band is synonymous with great 70s hard rock as much as Aerosmith. With their blues-based boogie grooves, the \\"toxic twins\\" Steven Tyler, (vocals) and Joe Perry, (guitar) along with Brad Whitford, (guitar) Tom Hamilton (bass) and Joey Kramer (drums) produced some of the best rock albums of the 1970s, most notably \\"Toys in the Attic\\" (1975) and \\"Rocks\\" (1976).<br /><br />Often a band's best album is their debut. It is common for a band to tour and tour and tour, perfect a batch of songs, release it on a spectacular debut, and then run out of ideas and have to face the \\"sophomore slump.\\" With Aerosmith, however, the band didn't really get its groove until their third album \\"Toys in the Attic.\\" Aerosmith's 1973 self-titled debut and its follow-up \\"Get your Wings\\" (1974) are good solid albums, but seem rather tepid and underwhelming when compared to the band's mid 70s prime material. While the self-titled debut contains the classics \\"Dream On\\" and \\"Mamma Kin,\\" the rest of the album isn't up-to-par. That's not to say that the self-titled debut only has two good songs and a bunch of filler; as the rest of the album is good, it's just that it doesn't compare with the band's later material. With the self-titled debut Aerosmith found their signature, it's just that the band's writing hadn't yet reached its peak. While the opening \\"Make it\\" and the classic balled \\"Dream On\\" and the rocking \\"Mamma Kin\\" stand as some of the band's best work, the rest of the album is just good, but not great.<br /><br />If you are an Aerosmith fan, by all means, get this album. If you are new to Aerosmith, however, start off with \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"Rocks\\" before buying the debut.

0786856297|5.0|THis is one of the best books I have read in a while.  Once I started, I could't stop so I read for four hours (from 10:00 pm to 2:00 am) unitl I finished.  The idea of Olympus being on top of the Empire State building, and the Underworld being in L.A. was really funny.  This is also a good action book.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I suppose many \\"elitists\\" out there will criticize me for choosing an album of (mostly) cover songs of other artists as the best Johnny Cash album, but as a personal preference, this is my favorite of his output; and it is a testament to the power of his music that he can make cover songs his own. <br /> <br />For me, the highlight of this album in particular is \\"Hurt.\\" I never cared much for the Nine Inch Nails version, but Cash does it justice. Trent Reznor cried when he first saw the music video (while working with Zach de la Rocha in the recording studio), and after I first saw the video, it left quite an impression - it's hard to put a finger on what, exactly, the music (and video) does to you, but it's a powerful statement. <br /> <br />This was Cash's farewell and it's a fitting bookend to a lifelong legacy that will be remembered for years to come.
B000002TQV|5.0|It would be hard to find many people who thought Radiohead could do what they did on this album. Just a couple years before, everybody and I mean everybody, was writing off Radiohead as a one hit wonder band because of the infamous 'Creep.' Nearly every critic panned 'Pablo Honey' and in all honesty I would agree to a certain extent. The Bends is leaps and bounds better for multiple reasons. The album as a whole just sounds better, Thom has more confidence in his vocal work, guitars by Ed and Jonny are superb and the band as a whole is clicking. The first song, 'Planet Telex,' is a worthy first song and it is obvious Radiohead has changed. Other standout tracks are 'The Bends,' 'Fake Plastic Trees,' 'Just,' 'My Iron Lung,' 'Black Star,' and one of my favourite Radiohead tracks of all time, 'Street Spirit.' Many fans who do not like the Ok Computer-present era believe this album is Radiohead's best. I would be hard pressed to disagree. I listened to this album over and over for several days and I still enjoy greatly. For a first timer, this would be the album to start off with to give Radiohead a listen.
0307010856|5.0|I had this book when I was younger and would love reading it, then when i got older i would read it to my sisters, the fun was amplifiying your voice or whispering as he did and they would giggle and laugh all the way through it.  Usually I did too.  This is a GREAT book the anticipation never stops and i am very much grown up now.<br /><br />There are few books this great.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I rented 'Shaun of the Dead' back when it first came out over a year ago. When I first saw the film, I laughed out loud several times and chuckled at other places. I recently purchased this DVD after having the urge to view it again and I have to say this is a classic, one of my favourite film of all time. In order to truly get this film you have to view it multiple times. I watched this movie three days in a row and every time i watched it I picked up new tidbits which made the film even more hilarious then the last. This film is laced with details and jokes that are truly genius. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright did a masterful job with the script and each character is wonderfully cast. Although this is a comedy for the most part, the story is really tight and  gets serious. Overall, a great flick that great to watch with some of your friends.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Truman Capote was for a time, famous for being famous..Moreso, since Capote had written \\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" at an astonishingly precocious age, a title he pirated from a wealthy confidante who told him about a sexual encounter he'd had with a sailor, and the next morning Capote's friend said to his guest, \\"Brunch is on me at the finest restaurant you can name\\", and the seaman said, \\"Well, let's have breakfast at Tiffany's!\\"..Capote, like all resourceful writers salted that away, for that useful rainy day..It was a title in search of a novel..And that's how Capote worked, he imagined a scenario and spent months constructing it in his sub-conscious mind, then went into seclusion and wrote like the devil..Capote stumbled upon the senseless killing of an an upright, God fearing family in Kansas while perusing the backpages of the New York Times, and realized there was sensational value in the story, and intended to write how the murders affected the community, regardless if the perpetrators were ever captured..Capote told his editor he was leaving for Kansas immediately, and would take Harper Lee, author of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", along as his research assistant..Nell, Harper Lee, would prove invaluable to Capote since she had an engaging ability to charm a rural community already on extreme edge since the incident, and was less shocking than Truman upon introduction..Capote met Alvin Dewey, the Bureau agent in charge of capturing the killers and told him he needed carte blanche to the police files, but was not concerned if the killers were found, he only wanted to write how the town was holding up!..Dewey told Capote, \\"Well, I do care, Herb Clutter was my friend\\"..In the end, Capote used his contagious charm to defrost the community, and was granted first person status, above all other journalists covering the crime, in fact Capote wrote a friend, \\"People here initially rejected me, but now I'm practically the Mayor.\\"..When Capote and Nell first spyed Perry Smithand Dick Hickok in court at their arraignment, Capote told Nell, \\"Look, Perry Smith's feet barely touch the ground.\\"..Nell told a friend, \\"Oh my God, this is the beginning of an intense love affair between Truman and Perry\\"..While writing \\"In Cold Blood\\", Truman changed course and realized the article intended for The New Yorker would become a narrative novel, since the subject matter expanded, and his editors agreed..Six years hence in utter agony \\"In Cold Blood\\" was published, and Capote was the recipient of adulation not seen since Hemingway wrote \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\"..The net result became, Capote had the wealth and celebrity to finance his disintegration, and never finished another novel..Capote died alone at the home of Joanne Carson, wife of late night talk show host Johnny Carson at the age of 59, suffering from acute alcoholism and drug addiction, perhaps because he never recovered from the trauma inflicted on himself from \\"expoiting\\" Perry Smith, who died compliments of the state of Kansas, from a hangman's noose, for the shotgun murders of the Herb Clutter family, for a score of 29 dollars, and a transistor radio.

B00005JO9G|5.0|This was an excellent sequel to the first. They did an amazing job on everything in the movie...although the second sexual scene was a bit unnecessary I think kate and scott was all the movie needed but that's just me. There are lots of twists and turns and I actually wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was and I'm a huge fan of the first one since kate is so badass in both!! >) Not sure if there will be a third but it appears as if they might attempt it. Like I said I have NEVER heard such positive feedback in a theater from everyone for any movie I've been to. Everything I kept hearing was \\"I am getting that when it comes out on DVD\\" and \\"that was so good...I'm surprised, pleasantly surprised\\" and to not hear not one person say something negative is a rarity.
B000002J1F|4.0|I just purchased this supposedly \\"remastered\\" edition of Fragile, the 2003 release on Rhino/Elektra.  Amazon's record for the item calls it \\"remastered,\\" but the words do not appear on the cd's actual packaging. The booklet for the item is riddled with typos, including several misspellings of \\"Roundabout.\\" The photos in the booklet look like fourth generation images, the quality you'd get if you clipped pictures out of old magazines, then made color copies, then pasted 'em on a layout, then printed! The Roger Dean artwork is fuzzy. The bar code for this inadequate reissue is 8122-73789-2. Can anyone out there confirm that this is \\"normal\\" for this reissue? I'm trying to figure out if I've purchased a counterfeit through an amazon affiliate. Thanks
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This is a great live album. Many songs are much more better here than what they produced in their studio. The roar of the crowd really is great and it adds more entertainment value to this album. I can imagine how ppl gone crazy in the Zero Bullshit thing in 'Spit It Out'. Even though I dislike the turntables sound (I think it's needless to add such thing in metal music), but in here, the turntables just sound to get into the music and doesn't sound annoying like what it did in their first album, Slipknot. <br /> <br />The only disappointment is that Corey's voice doesn't sound as powerful as in their studio production. His screaming isn't as heavy and thundering like what he done in the studio and sometimes he sounded like he was tired and hardly could catch the breath (listen to '(SIC)'). But I think all of that is okay, Corey is a great performer though. He had done a great job. The interactions he did with the audience is awesome and they sure know how to put on a good show. The backing vocal is great too and isn't disappointed. <br /> <br />The drumming and percussion are nothing to be said anymore. Every one knows that Slipknot always got good drumming in their song. This is what they are always proud of. Joey is a great drummer. He really done great drumming in each song and there's a track where he do solo drumming which show his awesome drumming skill and proof that he's an amazing drummer. <br /> <br />If only Slipknot will add some guitar solo to their song, then they're a perfect metal band. I'm expecting to see Slipknot come out with guitar solo in their future work. <br /> <br />This album is Slipknot at their very best. For you, all the head-bangers, the whole album will make you head-banging all over the place like crazy. So what are you waiting for?! Bring back this CD home and turn it to the loudest.

B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second studio album Ride the Lightning was released in 1984. It came only one year after their debut Kill `Em All. Although many of the mainstays on Metallica's set list are present on this album, it's sadly underrated. Many Metallica fans consider Master of Puppets to be their masterpiece but all of the elements that make Master a thrash epic are evident in Ride the Lightning. <br /> <br />When one first listens to the album they may wonder if they bought the right album. The opening track \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" begins with a joyful guitar arrangement that seems more at home on the soundtrack to Bambi. In a moments notice, the faade is dropped and a torrential rain of sixteenth notes punctuated by power chords assaults the listener. James Hetfield mirrors the rhythm guitar part with his vocal, which lyrically is about the concept of M.A.D, or mutually accepted destruction. One highlight of this song apart from the furious rhythm guitar would have to be the dual guitar harmony part that comes in near the finish that is reminiscent of the work of Iron Maiden. <br /> <br />The title track is thematically about a man that is on death row dreading his execution in the electric chair. While the chorus is catchy, the rest of the song is rather uninspired and consists of little more than eighth notes on the low E string being played at a moderate pace. <br /> <br />\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is one of the three tunes off of this record that nary a Metallica concert goes without. One of the main highlights of the song is Cliff Burton's bass playing. Also, the main riff of this song is one of the most identifiable riffs in all of heavy metal. <br /> <br />\\"Fade to Black\\" was a big departure from everything Metallica had done previously. This is Metallica's version of a power ballad. Unlike the rest of Metallica's songs up to this point which had all implemented a heavily distorted rhythm guitar, \\"Fade to Black\\" included a finger picked passage for the intro and verse sections. The song contains three tasteful solos by Kirk Hammett which are much more melodic than most of his work at the time and is far better than his \\"noodling\\" on Kill `Em All. The song was such a departure from their regular sound that it prompted many fans to call the band sellouts. The song also received flack from the PMRC for its lyrics about suicide. Many fans have stated in Metallica's defense that the song helped them in rough times in their lives. <br /> <br />\\"Trapped Under Ice\\" is a good song but when compared to the other stellar tracks on the album, it just doesn't compare. <br /> <br />\\"Escape\\" is lyrically about a person being who they want to be instead of letting others control their life. <br /> <br />\\"Creeping Death\\" is another standout track that no Metallica performance goes without. The song is about the plagues depicted in Exodus. The song seems anything but holy when the band starts chanting \\"Die\\" over Hetfield's thundering rhythm guitar. The song is concluded by one of Hammett's more memorable solos and then Hammett and Hetfield joining in for some more Iron Maiden-esque harmony guitar parts. <br /> <br />\\"Call of Ktulu\\" is an epic instrumental based upon the story of Cthulhu by H.P. Lovecraft. The song is very creepy as it employs great use of chromatics in many of the riffs. For the last half of the song, Kirk Hammett's lead guitar pyrotechnics takes center display.  <br /> <br />Ride the Lightning is perhaps Metallica's finest album. Even thought there are some tracks which obviously don't stand out as much as the album's premiere tracks, they are all great songs, better than what most other bands in the genre are capable of. Every fan of heavy metal needs to have this album in their collection. <br /> <br />

B000BJS4TO|5.0|This is it. The follow-up score to \\"Schindler's List\\" that everyone was expecting in 1994, but never got. It's passionate, beautiful, ominous, painful and features remarkable solo performances. <br /> <br />Countless reviews before me have mentioned it, but Williams was going for the feel of a river in this score, and it definitely translates to the listener. The music flows seamlessly from track to track, from gentle gushing and playful bouncing to deep and dark, culminating in the appropriately-titled \\"Confluence\\". But enough with the water metaphors! The two recurring themes are \\"Sayuri's Theme\\" and \\"The Chairman's Waltz\\", with the former the central idea of the score. Some tracks revolve around the theme, but in others it dips in quietly and leaves so it never feels overused. The Waltz sounds almost European - very reminiscent of \\"Jewish Town\\" from \\"Schindler\\", but it's still hauntingly beautiful. Other highlights include the extremely catchy \\"Going To School\\" and, of course, the \\"Yep, that's Williams\\" track, \\"Confluence\\". The whole score builds up to it, but it's still restrained enough to retain dignity. Though it never reaches those unchained heights from \\"Schindler's List\\", it never feels like it should have. <br /> <br />Like Yo-Yo Ma said in an interview, Memoirs is definitely a Williams score; not because it sounds like his other scores or he reused ideas, but because all of these worlds are a part of him, so he is a part of them. A brilliant score in an astounding year from the Maestro.
0156027321|5.0|Having finished Life of Pi yesterday, and then reading about 100 reviews here, I've decided to throw my oar in the water, so to speak. <br /> <br />Could it be that the reason \\"we will believe in God\\" after reading this book (I believe Martel wrote that phrase with tongue-firmly-in-cheek)is that this fable is an allegory for Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and possibly (thanks to the person who pointed out the Tsimtsum reference) kabbalistic Judaism -- all separate, but equally, represented? <br /> <br />I can speak to the Christian allegory I read.  I don't know enough about Hinduism or Islam to understand the allegorical references here.  But I do believe they're here.  I believe that Yann Martel has told us unequivocally that he finds value in all three religions, and I believe they're all \\"hidden\\" in this book. Doesn't a prince ride a tiger in one of many famous Hindu art pieces?  Please, could well-read and deeply-faithful Hindus or Muslims please respond here so we might know your thoughts? <br /> <br />As a Christian,let me share what I see Martel imputing into this fable: <br /> <br />The Life of Pi is the life of Everyman or Everywoman.  Pi, of course, is without beginning or end, just as we are, just as our souls will always be -- eternal and of great significance. <br /> <br />If orange is the color of Hinduism and the green the color of Islam, I vote for blue as the color of Christianity.  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.  Heavenly blue is also the historic color of faith, as well as representational of the Virgin Mary during the Gothic and Renaissance periods.  Pi floats between blue sea and sky. <br /> <br />Pi, like Noah, has been forced to live in his private ark, taking care of the animals.  In the beginning, God told man to have dominion over all the birds of the air and the fish of the sea and the animals on land. Pi is saddened as he learns to kill and eat flesh, but he must do it in order to survive.  There is an order andregimen to his days, just as God said after the flood (hmmmmm) that daytime and nightime, planting and harvest, the seasons, would never cease. <br /> <br />More than that, the lifeboat is really its own island, just as all of us live as \\"islands\\" alone, bobbing along the mostly blue surface of this planet. (With no apologies to John Donne . . .)    <br /> <br />Each of us must come to terms with our own loneliness, our own sin and brutal nature that travel as part of us through life (Richard Parker). We are all sinners-saints and equally divided, just as the lifeboat is divided into two separate areas.  Our brutal nature scares us and in fact energizes us as we try to keep it at bay. Pi, in the book, thanks Richard Parker for keeping him alive.  It's doubtful that a less fearful creature would have kept him so occupied in building a raft, securing enough water, finding food to feed both of them, being attentive, etc. <br /> <br />The survival manual in the lifeboat is similar to the \\"instruction books\\" we have been given to navigate the waters of life -- the Bible, the Bhagavadgita (sp?), the Koran, the Torah. Of course, each of us believers reverences our own particular book, but these books exist and chart the way for each believer. <br /> <br />What about the French cook, also blind, also floating on his own island?  Interesting that Pi's influences (Pondicherry) and even his name (Piscine) are half-French, half-Indian and that these two parts also meet in the water.  Perhaps Pi's imagination summons up a cook because of his hunger? The French represent the old rule of India -- the \\"old man\\" -- who dies off with that encounter. I think of the old hymn \\"Amazing Grace\\":  I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see.  Point made. <br /> <br />The floating green island, I believe, is an allegory of Eden, untouched, unblemished, filled with creatures who are innocent and have no fear. Don't forget the tree in the middle of this island who eats man.  Godexpressly forbid man to eat of the fruit of the \\"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\\" or he would die.  Someone did eat of this fruit and Pi -- all of us --are the worse for it. The Garden of Eden was polluted by sin and so became a Venus fly-trap, a flesh-eating creature. The Earth sprouted thistles and weeds, which forces all men (and women)to labor and to work hard for our daily bread.  Finally, it consumes us all at the grave. <br /> <br />Pi survives to tell the tale. He is ressurected after a near-death, returning to tell us both a tale of heaven and a tale of hell. <br /> <br />I'm sure when I reread this book one day I will see much, much more. Please, fellow-readers, Hindus and Muslims, will you enlighten us as to what you see of your faith \\"hidden\\" in this fable?  I would love to learn even more of the intricacies of this book and the careful weaving of timeless truths and stories that it encompasses!  Bravo, Yann Martel!

B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot was written to tell a story (a \\"punk rock opera\\"). The title of the album in itself, and it's art, explains of what's to come. There's much confusion to actually what this album and all of its songs mean, and it's questioned to what it could mean. I'm following, basically, with my own outlook, and from information from the band.<br /><br />DEFINITIONS IN THE STORY:<br /><br />J./JOS/the Idiot of America: The Jesus of Suburbia Tunny: Random person met on the street who Jimmy befriends The Underbelly: JOS/Jimmy's group of friends Mom and Brad: JOS' parents. The way that JOS refers to his father as Brad, could mean that is father is gone and Brad is a stepfather, which would explain why he's calling him by name.<br /><br />AMERICAN IDIOT<br /><br />The title track of the album. Basically, there's a confused, disoriented, angsty kid wrapped around a world of misconception and he has nowhere to go and feels hopeless and miserable. So this kid, the Jesus of Suburbia, is just crying out an anthem for the world to hear, screaming miserably \\"Don't wanna be an American Idiot...\\" He sees that he's stuck in this 'redneck agenda' and there's not a thing he can do to change it.<br /><br />JESUS OF SUBURBIA<br /><br />Everyone on the album has their own track. Jesus of Suburbia basically introduces us to the Jesus of Suburbia, how he was brought up in rage, and love, his atmosphere, friends, and basic general information. Part I, JOS, is just an introduction. \\"I'm the son of rage and love, the Jesus of Suburbia...\\"...Part II, City of The, is just a crying out for help, hating his town, his city, and his overall miserable life that he lives. Part III, I Don't Care, is properly named and is about just that. JOS' apathetic screams of pain and how he just doesn't care about anything anymore. Part IV, Dearly Beloved, is JOS asking if what he's feeling is natural, how he can get out, and if anyone can understand...Tales Of Another Broken Home, Part V, is basically the end of the anthem. JOS is fed up, and just decides to quit town and quit the life that he's living. \\"I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize. When there ain't NOWHERE you can go. RUNNING AWAY from pain, when you feel victimized, tales from another broken home\\"...and he just leaves.<br /><br />HOLIDAY<br /><br />So JOS has just left town and he's living his life on the streets (Hear the sound of the falling rain...). He's speaking outloud and acting in vein :P, but it seems like he's talking himself into the fact that running away was the right thing to do. Explaining his reasons of discontent to himself. He still feels alone, and shunned from society, but it seems he feels a little more self-confidence, and happiness out on the road. It is also remotely political with the whole \\"Zeig heil...\\" thing, but it's basically just JOS yelling out and expressing his own dead beliefs onto the world. Like screaming into mid air. Also, to go 'on holiday' is said to be like, a vacation. So this is basically like an escape, a runaway. This leads us into Boulevard of Broken Dreams.<br /><br />BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS<br /><br />JOS is out alone, on the cold streets, nothing to do, nowhere to go. The happiness has worn off and he walks alone. Everyone's asleep, no one can hear him, no one cares, and he just walks...<br /><br />ARE WE THE WAITING?<br /><br />Still, alone, living it rough. JOS plays tricks in his mind, and you can see his slowly losing his sanity. He even starts to not believe who he is anymore. He's not the king of his local 711 out on the streets, where no one knows who he is...he's not the Jesus of Suburbia anymore. He's just...there.<br /><br />Now is where the controversy starts. The album picks up into an angry, purely amazing, anthem about the ever-so-lovely St. Jimmy. Now, people have said, and this sounds pretty true, that the JOS is just pushed over the edge, turned into this new you punk named St. Jimmy. Basically, pushed off of the deep end into schizophrenia. Green Day, actually has stated, that JOS meets this kid, St. Jimmy, on the street somewhere, but that's questionable. I'll leave the interpretation up to you.<br /><br />ST. JIMMY<br /><br />Fast, upbeat, so hardcore. St. Jimmy...the patron saint of the denial. Tough, rough, not afraid to kill. The run of the mill punkkid times 70. The hardest, baddest guy around. He's lived his life on the streets, knows all, sees all. Lies, and pretty cocky to boot. He can actually be seen as a foil to JOS, who's totally innocent and callow going into this thing.<br /><br />GIVE ME NOVACAINE<br /><br />JOS meets Jimmy and becomes close with him. They do everything together, hang around together and JOS depends on Jimmy to keep him sane, without knowing anyone else. Give Me Novacaine is basically his experimentation and how Jimmy introduces him to everything to ease the pain of everyday life.<br /><br />SHE'S A REBEL<br /><br />While on the streets, Jimmy and JOS meet a rebel girl named Whatsername. As described in She's A Rebel, she's holding on JOS' heart like a hand grenade. For JOS, it's love at first sight. It's a basic introduction to the girl, and a new twist in JOS' heart strings. New feelings, new mindset, new atmosphere.<br /><br />EXTRAORDINARY GIRL<br /><br />Again, about Whatsername. JOS' feelings for her, what he thinks of her, etc...<br /><br />LETTERBOMB<br /><br />After getting close with Whatsername, there is an eventual breakup. The beginning \\"Nobody likes you, everyone left you...\\"...is Whatsername taunting JOS, and writing him a goodbye letter. She explains that JOS doesn't care enough, and that he isn't who he thinks he is. \\"You're not the Jesus of Suburbia. The St. Jimmy is a figment of, your father's rage and your mother's love, that's made the idiot america\\"...she's explaining that JOS has turned into what he's always hated and she leaves him. \\"Well she said I can't take this place, I'm leaving you behind. She said I can't take this town I'm leaving you tonight...\\"<br /><br />WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS<br /><br />JOS is alone again. Lost his friends, the only girl he ever loved, he's out of home, out of job, and back where he started, sad and alone on the streets. He describes himself as innocent, or at least he was, and he just didn't last. They broke him down, and he's just dead inside. This is also, on a more personal note, a side song about Billie Joe's late father, who died years ago (September 1982), when Billie Joe was 10. Both explanations apply.<br /><br />HOMECOMING<br /><br />JOS has nothing left to do. He's been on the streets. He stands alone again. So where else to go? Home. Part I, the Death of St. Jimmy. He's leaving the streets, he's going back, he's leaving Jimmy behind. He realizes that turning away wasn't the answer, and he's gained nothing from it except knowledge that life is no better in a different atmosphere. He hoped for too much, and got nothing in return. St. Jimmy kills himself, in a sense, in JOS' mind he's gone. Still, there's no one who cares, and nobody cares. Part II, East 12th St, tells us that JOS met and accepted conformity, got a job, and is just in his own world as people move around him. He'd rather be out and around with 'the underbelly', his friends. He feels trapped. Alone, and again, must get away. \\"This lifelike dream ain't for me\\"...Part III, Nobody Likes You. He's still depressed about losing Whatsername, as he waits for her to return, but no luck. All of his dreams at this point are shot to hell, as her voice still pounds in his head \\"NOBODY LIKES YOU, EVERYONE LEFT YOU...\\" Part IV, Rock 'N Roll Girlfriend, in the inlay, is shown as a postcard from \\"Tunny\\"...who seems to be another person JOS met while on the streets. Tunny explains that he's living it up where he is, and the rebel life he leads, while JOS is rotting with his dead end job, in his dead end life. Part V, We're Coming Home Again, is JOS accepting things. He's coming to the realization of everything and everyone, and is just accepting it. He comes home. It's left on a confusing note. He's not sure if he's happy or sad, he's just home, living, and he just...is.<br /><br />WHATSERNAME<br /><br />After being home, and just living in normality, he still regrets losing Whatsername. It's been so long, he can't even remember her name. He wonders what happened to her, and can only remember. All he has is his memories of her. The album ends with him still trying to forget \\"If my memory serves me right, I'll never turn back time, forgetting you, but not the time.\\"...He doesn't regret living his life on the streets, using it as a learning experience, but still tries to forget Whatsername, and the pain that she put him through, and vice versa.. She said I can't take this town I'm leaving you tonight...\\" <br /> <br />WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS <br /> <br />JOS is alone again.

As the human (Buddy the Elf, of course) grows, he can't help but notice he's \\"different.\\"  And finally, Buddy is told the somber truth--that he is not an elf, that he is a human, and that his father (who happens to be on Santa's \\"Naughty List\\") resides in Manhattan.  And so Buddy sets off, on foot, (after saying goodbye to various animated North Pole pals) to the Big Apple, where mayhem reigns supreme upon his arrival.<br /><br />Like I said:  nonsense.  But funny nonsense.  Will Ferrell plays Buddy with simultaneous naivete and tongue-in-cheek raunchiness; he more than carries this film on his bright green shoulders.  James Caan is pure vanilla bland as Buddy's reluctant, long-lost father, while Bob Newhart is at his deadpan best.  The plot is hokey, the ending syrupy (as is Buddy's diet) and contrived, yet ELF had me laughing in spite of my curmudgeonly self.  The holy grail of entertainment is escapism, and ELF takes the viewer directly into the story and doesn't let go until the last giggle.<br /><br />This is a movie not only appropriate for Yuletide cheer, but anytime one needs a raucous laugh.  My only concern is my utter confusion:  ELF's elves are little munchkin midgets, while the elves in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" are tall and stoic.  Wow.  Guess I've gotta brush up on my elfology.<br /><br />--D. Mikels
0393317552|1.0|I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if you're going to point out a lot of problems, at least have the ben wahs to offer a solution or two.   How hard is that?  I'm not a writer, but for this book, I could at least come up with something like: Teflon vest, HandiWipes & a good suit of plated field armor.  Take that Jared, now go get another 6 inch lowfat Subway sandwich & be hungry again at 3:30...
B000000ORX|5.0|Old hippies (like me) will love this album but it's already 15 years old! I was amazed by the beautiful melodies and complex arrangements but it was the lyrics that hit me like bullet. Joni, now 62, has never made a bad album but \\"Night Ride Home\\" is one of her best. Recommended with a glass of wine or a bit of ganja.
B000001ES9|4.0|While they were just getting their foot in the door with their 1973 self-titled debut album (1974 in the U.S.), Rush showed glimpses of what they could (and would!) evolve into on successive releases. Starting out as a blues-driven hard-rock act, Rush combined fantastic musicianship, integrity, and a love of music that set them apart from most bands. Combining the styles of bands like The Who, the Yardbirds, and Led Zeppelin, the resultant fusion was a great framework for the genre-defying progressive rock that Rush would create throughout the 1970s. <br /> <br />Rush is a fantastic release, though by no means their most solid work. Most of Geddy Lee's lyrics on this album are a bit generic, and look almost comical when one views the lyrics that future drummer Neil Peart wrote on most of their songs once he joined the band before the Fly By Night album was released in early 1975. <br /> <br />1. Finding My Way - A solid and rocking opener to kick off the album, this track starts off with a bluesy riff, which increases in volume as the measures repeat. The intro lyrics sound quite a bit like something Robert Plant would belt out on a Led Zeppelin song, but I forgive Rush for this being their first album. Bands start off by playing what they know and love, and the bands that inspire them oftentimes find their way (no pun intended) into the early works of a new band. The solo is solid and the post-solo riff is tight. All in all, this is a great intro track and the recording sounds fantastic to this day: 11 out of 13 (84.6%). <br /> <br />2. Need Some Love - A short track with a fast tempo and cheesy lyrics. I dig the vibe of this song, even if the lyrics are sub-par. The drumline following the second chorus is simplistic but solid, and John Rutsey was not a bad drummer by any means. The guitar solo is short and sweet. This song: 10 out of 13 (76.9%). <br /> <br />3. Take A Friend - This track fades in slowly with a driving drum beat and a sweet guitar lick which repeats for many measures before the rhythm guitar kicks in to begin the first verse. The chorus showcases the seed of vocal harmony that would become an intregal part of Geddy Lee's fantastic vocals in future releases. Yet another guitar solo graces this song, and it fits in nicely with the rest of the song. That's one thing about Rush is that the individual parts don't sound out of place, whether it's a flashy drum, bass, or guitar solo. Rating: 11.5 out of 13 (88.5%). <br /> <br />4. Here Again - The longest track on the album, clocking in at seven and a half minutes, Here Again closed out the first side of the original vinyl album. A slow-tempo song with a groovy rhythm guitar line which graces a large portion of the track time. Geddy's vocals sound more mature on this track, though it is spotty. You can tell that Geddy's voice wasn't fully mature, and may have still been changing from his teenage years. This song makes you want to sit back, relax, and enjoy some good rock music. The guitar solo near the five minute mark stretched out for a solid minute and a half, and is smooth as silk. It has a nice echo added, and doesn't sound out of place at all. The second solo near the end of the song is great, and closes out the track perfectly. This song gets: 10.5 out of 13 (80.8%). <br /> <br />5. What You're Doing - A neat little ditty with a cool guitar riff. John Rutsey's drumming is solid in this track, and Geddy's wisecracking lyrics aimed at naysayers are bang-on. The guitar solo is top-notch and Rutsey's snare roll is solid as can be. The closing is a bit much with a few false endings, but the mini guitar solo makes up for it. Survey says: 11 ouf of 13 (84.6%). <br /> <br />6. In The Mood - This track is one of my favorite Rush tunes, and boasts a good intro guitar riff, which carries the rhythm of the tune during the verses. Lyrics are generic, but Geddy's vocals are good. Drums keep up the beat, as usual, but nothing too flashy from Rutsey. Alex Lifeson belts out ashredding solo which is a fine tribute to blues form. This song gets: 12 out of 13 (92.3%). <br /> <br />7. Before And After - A peek into what Rush would evolve into in later albums, Before And After is a solid track which begins with a somber guitar riff and a slow tempo. Lots of harmonics and clean chords. Distortion kicks in at about a minute, and once the verse kicks in, the song shifts tempo up a bit. Geddy's vocals are varied, and the simple chorus (Yeah...Yeeeeaah) is quite effective. Alex unfolds another fantastic solo in this song which sounds perfectly in place with the rest of the song. I give it: 9.5 out of 13 (73.1%). <br /> <br />8. Working Man - A classic Rush tune, which gets a lot of air play on classic rock stations to this day. The big hit song off this album, which is surprising since it clocks in at seven minutes. A good and heavy guitar riff opens the song and carries the verses. A groovy little breakdown cuts the song in half, and the closing guitar riff/solo are fantastic. The boastful conclusion bids you good tidings until the next release. All in all: 11 out of 13 (84.6%). <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great classic rock album, and a good addition to your collection whether you're a casual or serious Rush fan. A more digestible form of Rush for the casual listener, and a glimpse into the roots of the prog-rock juggernauts they would become for the more serious music fan in the Rush spectrum. Overall rating of 'Rush': 10.8 out of 13 (83.1%).
0131479415|5.0|Mike tells everything you need to know about agile estimating and planning. He shows different alternatives and which ones work in which circumstances. The example chapter at the end provides a great overview of applying all the lessons learned.<br /><br />I regularly recommend this book to my clients.
0688163173|4.0|While reading this book, I couldn't help but feel as though I was in a fog most of the time -  a good thing in the sense that I had to figure out what was on the other side.  Man!  the ending still has me spinning, three years later.<br /><br />I found it to be refreshing and entertaining.  I have recommended this book to family and friends.
B00003CXBK|4.0|I am not an anime fan (in fact, I rather dislike it), but this movie is awesome. Don't view it as a cartoon - it is far, far more than that. Definitely a movie to make one think, nothing is ever clearly black and white. Lady Eboshi, while commiting what an environmentalist would consider unspeakable crimes (and I am one) also has a good heart, caring about the people in her charge. Give this one a try.
B00008AWOG|5.0|First off, I am NOT a metal expert in any sense of the word. As a matter of fact when I first heard \\"death\\" metal growls I laughed. I thought they were just so lame and corny. I bought \\"Damnation\\" by Opeth in 2003 and realized (IMO) that this music is a Godly masterpiece. Simply,cold beauty. I digress, Damnation has no growls and it was right up my alley. \\"Still Life\\" does have scorching death vox,as if Akerfeldt summoned them from the very pits of hell. Also Michael sings in a \\"clean\\" voice that is (IMO)the best voice in any genre of music. I would say 60% death vox and 40% clean, something like that. The concept attracted me, for it's about a man who is kicked out of his community by the town \\"council\\" for rebelling against the Christian theocracy held so dear in the town. In the process he loses his true love Melinda. The music and lyrics on \\"Still \\"Life are about his return and attempt to retrieve Melinda. The music could not be better in conveying this concept. As far as the growls I looked at the vocals as another instrument(for that's what the voice is)in conveying the tone and composition, that has helped me to not only like the death vox, but appreciate them as well!!! This will take a few listens to be fully revealed, be patient. Opeth is not just a \\"metal\\" band. They are all extremely gifted musicians in the truest sense of the word. You would be doing yourself a disservice for not listening to this band because of the death vox. Have an open mind and you will be rewarded. The song Benighted is quite possibly the most beautiful song I have ever heard. The way the clean vocals come in to the music is stunning. Opeth and Pain of Salvation are two metal bands that are completely unique and wonderful. They have certainly set the bar high, for all metal bands to come. All hail the mighty Opeth, Still Life is an absolute masterpiece. Peace.
0743455967|5.0|I've read a ton of &quot;how to&quot; books, and if I had to pick just one, I would pick Stephen King's &quot;On Writing.&quot; Everything you need to know is in this book. Character development, plot, dialogue, pacing, revision--it's all here. King has distilled a lifetime of writing into this little book. He also says what many other books say but adds biography and unmistakable King-like humor as he goes along.<br /><br />I wish I'd read King's book when I started to write fiction. I probably wouldn't have read all the others. I also don't keep many books on my shelf--most go back to the used bookstore--but Mr. King's is definitely a keeper.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Actully I Give this Recording and Show 100 Million Stars <br /> <br />I have seen Wicked  once on Broadway with the original cast and once in Denver Colorado.  From the moment you see Galinda/Glinda fly in on her bubble to the heart stopping second Elphaba, The Wicked Witch, takes flight ending Act 1 the the finalie this show is inspiring and Beautiful. <br /> <br />Now for the album, While Idina Menzel's booming voice sounds much, much better bouncing off the rafters in the Gershwin theater than on this cd it is still amazing and the same goes for Kristin Chenoweth. This cd is full of amazing orchrastrations and Whitty and Beautiful lyrics. I like everysong on the cd, but I will do a breakdown so you can make your own decision  <br /> <br />1 No One Mournes the Wicked- A great opening song. 8/10  <br /> <br />2 Dear Old Shiz- This song is short and progresses the story. 7/10  <br /> <br />3 The Wizard and I- Amazing vocals from Menzel make this song one for the books. 10/10  <br /> <br />4 What is This Feeling-Idina and Kristen blend well in this hurmors song. 9/10  <br /> <br />5 Somthing Bad- The only time you get to hear doctor Cillmond sing  adn he does it well, even if he does sound like a goat. 7/10  <br /> <br />6 Dancing Through Life- A big splashy show stopper that is very enjoyable. 8/10  <br /> <br />7 Popular- Kristin's big number is fun, funny, and a standout. 10/10  <br /> <br />8 I'm Not That Girl-Again Idina shines. 8/10  <br /> <br />9 One Short Day- Another show stopper. Makes me want to spend one day in OZ 10/10  <br /> <br />10 A Sentimental Man- Short and Sweet. 7/10  <br /> <br />11 Defying Gravity- Inarguably the absolute best song on the album and in the show. Idena gives this song her all. the ending will have you in tears every single time you hear it. 20/10  <br /> <br />12 Thank Goodness- Another kristen song, a little long but enjoyable. 9/10  <br /> <br />13 Wonderful-A song to spotlight Joel Grey's talent. 7/10  <br /> <br />14 I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)-The only reprise on the album. Same as above, but with Chenoweth singing this time. 8/10  <br /> <br />15 As Long as You're Mine-A truly intresting love song with a hint of longing. Norbert Leo Butz and Idina Menzel sound great together. 9/10  <br /> <br />16 No Good Deed- Again Menzel belts it out in this song.  <br /> <br />17 March of the Witch Hunters- A short song that progresses the story, It remindes me of \\"\\"The Mob Song\\" from Beauty and the Beast\\". 7/10  <br /> <br />18 For Good- The final duet between Elphaba and Glinda. 9/10  <br /> <br />19 Finale- Great! 7/10  <br /> <br />* The Wicked Witch of the East- this song isn't included on the cd because it is mostly talking and would give away too much of the plot.  <br /> <br />All in all this is a great Broadway musical and a great cast recording.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I listen to this day in and day out, and still love to listen for it on the radio. The music seems to flow through my mind, and yet each song is different from the other. I got the C.D. mostly for the song Boulevard of Broken Dreams, but it turned out that all the other songs were just as enjoyable than Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Give me Novicane is now one of my favorite songs, along with pretty much every other song on the C.D. This is especially great for older teens, but I sjould warn younger teens, there is foul langauge.
0743490304|4.0|I read this book even after reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. Even though it is not even close to both best sellers, I still believe is a great book!!! I really dont like the comparisons, since it is a whole new different topic. It has a lot of detail, the author has done a terrific job in all his research. I love those books which you can tell the author has done extensive research on the topic. Great book. Definitely worth reading. You wont regret buying it.
0553801503|3.0|I agree with some of what many of you have said. i think publisher pressure had a lot to do with the decision to release the book in this format, but after reading interviews with Martin i think there is more to it than that.<br /><br />  Basically what happened is that while writing this latest book he ran into a problem and had a decision to make. He could go the established route or try something different...and he chose to try something different. The problem that arose is that he had created a number of new characters to introduce in the book along with the established ones. He reached a point however, where he realized he would not be able to tell all of their stories in one book. He felt that rather than either tell only the newer characters stories or only focus on the previous characters would be a disservice to the fans.<br /><br />  Now, here comes the choice: either he, A. focuses on all the characters and cuts all their stories short, or B. Pick half of the characters and tell their complete stories, then later tell the other half in the next book. He obviously chose B. Now, i have to give Martin some credit. On paper this must have looked good and he honestly thought he was making the best choice for the fans. He obviously didn't mean to hurt the fans who hated this book. He took a 50/50 shot and in my view, it bombed. I personally think he made the wrong choice.<br /><br />  First of all, experimenting with literature is risky. I hate to say this Mr. martin but at this stage in the history of writing, if there is a literary convention that is never used...there is a Good reason for it! Especially when you change formats from your previous books in a series.<br /><br /> The really sad part to me is that it looks like the fans that hated this book because of the format will probably not like the next book any better. i am sorry to say all this because I think G.R.R. Martin is one of the most gifted fantasy authors of all time and i'd hate to see that reputation tarnished all because of a shot in the dark editing decision. but thats just me.
B00005JNEW|5.0|First, highschool does NOT define who you are for life! <br /> <br />Okay, with that said, this movie defines a CLASSIC football film.  One of the best.  Why Amazon is \\"packaging\\" this with crap like \\"Ray\\" I'll never know. <br /> <br />This movie excels with performances by all involved and a story that even non-football fans will find riveting.  The unnecessary \\"relationship\\" scenes at the beginning of the film have nothing ot do with the rest of the movie, but that is the only failure of this film...must needed to have appealed to younger audiences. <br /> <br />Adults and true football fans will see the tragedy and beauty that is Friday Night Lights.  A film that will go down as a classic in this genre.

B000067J1H|1.0|It's a number. A star. A rating. Tyler knows that. He doesn't care. He's just pleased to know that in a world where even God doesn't know most people's name, there's another man who knows who Tyler Durden is. <br /> <br />Tyler Durden lets Big Lou punch him repeatedly in the jaw, while laughing maniacally, mocking him and infuriating him. At the end of the scene, Tyler seems to make the point: Real men don't always beat the crap out of other men, Real Men laugh silly at other men who try their best to make them feel pain, but only fail repeatedly. How would you feel if you sucked in all the power you had, landed a blow on a dude, and he laughed in your face as if to say, \\"That's your best shot?\\" Not very good, I think. <br /> <br />Tyler Durden [Brad Pitt] is the manifestation of every man's fantasy. Good-looking, brash, arrogant, fights like a tank, takes a beating like a tank, ****s like a machine and doesn't do any REAL work. <br /> <br />The Narrator [Ed Norton] is the manifestation of most modern men's reality. Plain-looking, dead-end job, no stable relationship, a decent collection of lifestyle accessories and sheer boredom. <br /> <br />When the two meet, you might expect the movie takes the usual route where the two men get to learn from each other, and find that each person's life has as many highs as pitfalls, and that your life is what you make of it. Err...no. Tyler is an enigma. A revolutionary of sorts. Hell, he isn't here to \\"learn\\" about the Narrator. He's here to \\"Jack\\" his life!!! Tyler Durden is a bigger, larger-than-life figure than James Bond, the Terminator or even Neo. He could easily steal any one of Bond's potential bed-mates from right under his nose. He could easily program the Terminator to believe its existence was useless and that it should self-terminate. He might even make Neo give-up and dump the whole \\"Because I choose to..\\" talk. <br /> <br />This movie may not \\"change\\" your life, but it will affect it. You will develop a liking for red leather. You will start working on a new walk. You will start sizing people up everywhere you go. You will stop caring about the fact that you're a 6-foot 120-lbs weakling with 13\\" biceps. You will start to think, \\"I'm sure I could throw ONE good dislocating punch at a 220lbs biker even after I take 4 punches to my face\\". You will want to be in better shape. You will cringe at the idea of a woman having any kind of control over your life. You will want to learn the art of dead-pan sarcasm that scares your boss out of his/her wits. Watch this movie, and you will wish that someday, people will ask, \\"Say, Who is (insert your name)?\\" <br /> <br />One of the better \\"mainstream\\" movies to have come out of Hollywood in recent years. Unless you exclusively like movies with a \\"Made for Oscars\\" plot [Disabled dude learns to appreciate life, WWII/Vietnam Veteran learn the value of human life,Gay Dude stands up against the system, etc.], you will have a hard time wondering why this movie didn't win a few dozen awards. In Tyler, You Can Trust.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I'll leave it to the other reviewers who have offered rundowns of \\"Advent's\\" plot and named all the cameos of familiar faces from FFVII.  If nothing else, I just want to share how moved I felt when watching this movie!   <br /> <br />There were moments when the emotions conveyed by the characters felt so incredibly real to me that I had to remind myself this was still an animated flick.  Whatever plans Square-Enix has for the next generation of Playstation games, the gap between the virtual and the real surely will become increasingly blurred. <br /> <br />Visuals: excellent.  Soundtrack: compelling.  Storyline: a little sketchy at times, but it's decidedly convoluted in true FF fashion.  Obviously, Squeenix intended its audience to be intermediate-to-expert fans of the original game, given the countless nods to past events that aren't necessarily explained for their importance.  Who wants to be handheld during an action-packed movie anyway? <br /> <br />Not patient enough to wait for an English-dubbed copy to make its way to daylight, I bought mine through Amazon's Marketplace.  I have no qualms in reading while watching a film, and the subtitles seemed a decent translation for what little Japanese I actually understand (that would be none at all).  Aside from a few glitchy phrases that were clipped on the left and right margins of the screen (I don't have a widescreen TV), I never found myself utterly lost. <br /> <br />As others here have said, if you loved the original game, you'll undoubtedly love the movie.  This is one reunion you won't want to skip. Replaying FFVII has jumped to the top of my gaming to-do list!
B000BMSU68|5.0|I was very pleased to see that Paramount released a special collector's edition of the classic 1980s film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This special edition contains the original film with a digitally remastered 5.1 surround soundtrack. There is also a fairly good amount of bonus features, including a very nice documentary on the process by which the film makers selected the actors and actresses who would play Ferris, Sloane, Cameron, Jeanie, and Mr. Rooney. These bonus features contain interviews with the actors/actresses 20 years after the film was released, which provides a nice retrospect. <br /> <br />The movie itself follows the exploits of Ferris Bueller, a larger-than-life high school senior and a rebel with a cause who decides to skip school one spring morning. Bueller hooks up with his girlfriend Sloan and best pal Cameron and has a little fun in downtown Chicago. Meanwhile, the school's iron-fisted principal, Mr. Rooney, has caught on to Bueller's shenanigans and vows to catch Ferris playing hookey red-handed. Ferris's angry, bitter sister Jeanie is determined to bring down her brother as well. In the end, Ferris has the last laugh as he eludes his enemies and stands tall with pride. <br /> <br />This movie is loaded with tons of laughs and great acting. Matthew Broderick became an over-night star with his performance as Ferris Bueller, and Alan Ruck is terrific as Cameron, an uptight, stressed-out teenage son of over-protective parents. Director John Hughes includes some nice cinemetography of various Chicago locales, such as the shores of Lake Michigan, Wrigley Field, the Sears Tower, and downtown Chicago. <br /> <br />Ferris Bueller's Day Off remains the best of the \\"Brat Pack\\" 1980s flicks that centered on wise-cracking teenage schoolers (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, etc.) Fans of the film will be very pleased with this collector's edition.
B000AL730O|3.0|Wow, everybody wants to weigh in on Sir Paul, who has definitely made us think with this release. I'd say he generally puts out one great album each decade, with the exception of the '70s -- when \\"Band on the Run\\" and \\"Venus and Mars\\" competed for that title.  <br /> <br />This album grows on you. The first listen doesn't capture its essence. But \\"Too Much Rain\\" offers good-though-simplistic advice about depression and \\"Promise to You Girl\\" and \\"This Never Happened to Me Before\\" are Beatlesque (very catchy and upbeat). \\"At the Mercy\\" provides some beautiful symphonic work and is churchlike. \\"How Kind of You\\" makes you wonder if ol' Paul isn't being sarcastic. The final tune, \\"Any Way\\" provides some wonderful new sounds that are worth listening to over and over.  <br /> <br />Maybe it's just me, but Paul's voice sounds strained and he can't hit the high notes like he used to on a few of the tracks. Perhaps he should back off on the world tours to save his voice.  <br /> <br />It's obvious that working with Nigel did Paul a lot of good! Now if he'd just do more with Elvis Costello (as he did on \\"Flowers in the Dirt,\\" his best 1980s work).
0684847817|3.0|For those of you familiar with the Faery Oracle painted by Brian Froud and written by Jesa MacBeth, you know that this book is a wonderful companion. It provides extra insight about the faeries on the cards and lets us get a deeper peep into their personalities. I was delighted to find so many of the fae from the cards in the book, as promised.<br /><br />However, I was shocked if not a little angry that Morgana Le Fay was listed as a \\"bad\\" faery. Morgan is not a bad faery at all!  She began as Merlin's mentor, not the other way around, and was loyal to Arthur and loved him dearly. Otherwise, she would never have lain him to rest in Avalon.<br /><br />The reason we all believe her to be a bad faery is the bad wrap she was given by the monks who got their hands on the story. They rewrote Morgan as a villian in order to knock the legs from under women. In those times, women weren't allowed to be beautiful, magical, and clever all at once without being wicked -- and a woman as Merlin's mentor was too much for them, I suppose.<br /><br />It's these same sexist views that started the witch trails. Women were learning to read, getting educated, showing their cleverness -- and were being burned at the stake for it.<br /><br />I'm not trashing Brian Froud's work -- far from it, I think he's wonderful -- I just wanted to correct a common misconception. I'm sure Morgan would want it corrected.<br /><br />Well, I'll come off my soapbox now. Don't let this tiny mistake keep you from purchasing Good Faeries and Bad Faeries. It's actually a very good book and I hope to see more from Mr. Froud.
0553208845|5.0|Herman Hesse's mystical 1920s novel of the titular Indian youth who flees his Brahmin caste in search of deeper meaning in the universe is one which seems strangely anachronistic in our synthetic age, where most novels are exercises in banality and are devoid of any philosophical or spiritual content (I'm talking to you, Stephen King, and you, Da Vinci Code).<br /> \\"Siddhartha\\" is brief, yet extraordinarily powerful, with complex messages that take years, perhaps a lifetime to fully absorb. This is the book which first awakened me to the writings of German author Herman Hesse. It is powerful by anyone's standards, mostly because the themes it adressess(love, hate, death, the quest for truth, the conflict between the passions of the body and spiritual fulfillment, etc.) are so universal, But I think that, more than anything else, it was the time period during which I read \\"Siddhartha\\" that contributed so greatly to it's impact on me. I was a twelve- year-old with vague philosophical notions and stirrings of rebellion drifting about within; \\"Siddhartha\\" helped them assume a more tangible shape.<br /> The novel is embedded throughout with a colorful, earthy sense of the period in which it takes place, namely, that of Medieval India, when Gotama Buddha was first rising to prominence. The Buddha is, in fact, one of the foremost authorities Siddhartha questions during his journey. Why, he asks Buddha personally, is education promulgated by persons who are themselves uneducated? Why are the principles of Nirvana (enlightenment) taught by those who have not themselves experienced Nirvana?<br /> After his companion Govinda deserts him to join a clan of Buddhist monks, Siddhartha meets a charlatan who invites him into a morally bereft society where he is able to experience \\"Samsara\\" or \\"the game of life\\", first hand. It is here that Hesse explores one of the themes that will preoccupy him in many of his later works; the conflict between the lust of the body and the longing of the soul, the desire for material satisfaction and the need for greater spiritual fulfillment.<br /> And yet, by the end of his long quest, Siddhartha's bitterness towards the world disappears as he realizes, among many other things, that the threads of life are connected imperceptibly, that as we each pursue our singular destinies we are merely following paths that will bring us closer to one another.<br />  While the Eastern mysticism of \\"Siddhartha\\" may be rather off-putting to a Western society which believes only in fast food joints and one God, it definitely contains elements which are timeless and transcendent and will move any thinking person with their lyrical elegance and deceptive simplicity.<br /> If you liked this book, I suggest also reading \\"Of human bondage\\" by Somerset Maughaum, another tale of personal growth and discovery.l, the desire for material satisfaction and the need for greater spiritual fulfillment.

0553278223|5.0|Bradbury is my one of my favorites of the older generation of speculative fiction writers. He blends social commentary with strong and traditional plotting in a way that is both moving and accessible.<br /><br />The Martian Chronicles (published in 1950) is a set of short stories which together create a tapestry of life on Mars. The first story, \\"Rocket Summer\\" begins with the first human expedition to Mars and the book ends with \\"The Million Year Picnic\\" with what is most likely the last expedition. These stories are not concerned with accuracy or believability in the sense of science and xenoanthropology. Instead, they should be seen as a series of \\"What If\\" stories which illuminate all aspects of human behaviour: good, bad, and ugly. The believability comes in the way that people treat each other in times of great stress.<br /><br />You won't catch a fan of the genre giving this book less than five stars. It is too important and too well-written to be considered anything less than a classic. I will say that it is not my favorite Bradbury. Some of the stories are stronger than others. I think that some have not aged as well, and are too preoccupied with the concerns of the early 1950s when the book was released. Still, if you are interested in Bradbury or early speculative fiction then this is a must-read.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Bradbury's works already, then be aware that it has little in common with recent space opera. If you like writers such as Clifford Simak, Mary Doria Russell, or Michael Swanwick then you are probably will also enjoy this collection.
6304698623|3.0|My 5 year old daughter cried hysterically in the final scenes of this movie.  She said she hates this movie and wishes she had never seen it.  I feel this movie ought to be rated PG rather than G because the part just before the end was so emotionally wrenching.  When evil Miss Minchen accuses the main character Sara of stealing and calls forth a group of police to come arrest the girl, Sara nearly slips to her death as Miss Minchen grabs for her as she escapes during a thunderstorm to a neighbor's house.  There, she discovers her father is alive after all.  But her amazement turns to horror as he repeatedly denies knowing her (he has amnesia) and pushes her away.  Sara's cries of \\"Papa!\\" grow increasingly frantic.  By the time the police wrest Sara away from her father and carry her out the door, she is screaming and crying.  The father suddenly snaps out of his amnesia, but too late -- my sobbing daughter did not want to see any more.  In sum, this dark \\"G\\" movie is not for everyone in the family.
B0007TKNI8|5.0|I have never in my 60 plus years witnessed such passion and a great variety of emotions as I saw in this wonderful movie.<br /><br />I have been watching it daily on TV and now I'm going to make sure I have it and ordered the movie and companion book. I already have the soundtrack ordered.<br /><br />I now have a sincere appreciation of opera and after seeing this movie so many times I feel that the characters are talking instead of musically conveying their thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />I cannot compare this movie to any other that I've seen because no other production comes even close to this presentation and I would give it more than 5 stars if that were possible.<br /><br />Watch it my dear friends and enjoy.<br /><br />Also, the actors and the actresses did a beautiful job with their parts.  This is truly an entertaining movie that you don't want to miss.
B00000255F|5.0|It was on their third album, \\"Born To Run\\",that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band finally reached the heights of their power both musically and lyrically. There were many factors contributing to this. Bruce's vocals were much more confident, achieving the passionate, soaring quality that became his trademark. The band had also turned the sound up another notch, with Max Weinberg now on drums and Roy Bittan on piano and organ. The improved production gave the record a tighter and more epic sound. But, perhaps most importantly of all, Bruce was writing better songs. It was here that he left behind the Dylanesque wordplay and florid language for precise narrative stories of unique power and intensity, as Mary, Terry and Wendy join Rosalita in the world of classic Springsteen characters. \\"Thunder Road\\" finds Bruce coaxing Mary to hop in his car and hit the highway, leaving behind the Jersey streets in search of a brighter future - \\"it's a town full of losers, and I'm pulling out of here to win\\". \\"Backstreets\\" features Roy Bittan's haunting organ and recalls the intensity and sorrow of youthful romance, with Bruce and Terry - \\"sleeping in that old abandoned beach house, getting wasted in the heat\\". And, of course, there is the album's classic title track, where Bruce realizes the American dream he was brought up on is only \\"a death trap, it's a suicide rap\\". He's determined that Wendy and he get out while they still can, in search of that place where \\"we'll walk in the sun, but till then tramps like us, baby we were born to run\\".<br /><br />Future records would find Bruce and the band continuing to grow and develop in new directions. But, in capturing the intensity and anguish of youth, rock music just doesn't get any better than this!
0307276902|5.0|After all the finger pointing going on because of this book, I bought it and read it, I came away thinking 60% is probably true while the rest is made up. I do think it is a great book and I would recommend it, the descriptions of being high on drugs or being drunk are very real, too real. That is why I give it such a rating, once you start it you can't put it down.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|So after 35+ years we finally get a Cream reunion.  Wow.  The concert presented here is the best of four nights at the Royal Albert Hall.  And it's great.  The three guys are really enjoying themselves and it shows.  They are tight and play just as well as they did in the sixties.  Too bad they didn't do a full-fledged reunion tour.  I would have gone.  But this beats shelling out hundreds of dollars to attend the concert, and I can enjoy it over and over on the CD.  \\"I'm So Glad,\\" \\"Spoonful,\\" \\"NSU,\\" \\"White Room\\" and \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" are the highlights for me.  This CD is an absolute must for Cream fans.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|The Constant Gardener isn't just a movie, it truly is an experience.<br /><br />The story follows Justin Quayle on his journey through Africa after his wife, Tessa, is found murdered alongside an African country road.  Justin is a British diplomat, and Tessa had taken up her own antics while they were living in Africa.  And someone wanted her dead because she was digging too deep at something.  This is the basic plotline of The Constant Gardener.  This is a film about murder, revenge, politics, and faith.  The film is very political, and is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve.<br /><br />What makes a film good? Is it the story?  The action sequences?  The acting?  In the case of The Constant Gardener, it's all three of these.  The only flaw of the film is the pacing with which Fernando Meirelles directs.  The film seems to drag on at some points, but whenever it focuses back on the central story, and Justin's quest to find the truth, the film is truly captivating.  The film is even heartbreaking at moments.  The most powerful moment of the film comes when Justin finally breaks down and shows his grief when he returns to Tessa's home in Britain, and is greeted by flashbacks of their first intimate moments together.  Ralph Fiennes is an amazingly talented actor.  I still consider him not getting an Oscar for Schindler's List one of the greatest travesties of all time.  Fiennes is typically great in this film.  In my opinion, he deserves the Oscar for best actor, but he won't get it; too bad.  Rachel Weisz does an admiral job as Tessa Quayle, but nothing groundbreaking from her end.  The best character second to Fiennes' Justin Quayle is Bernard Pelligrim, played exquisitely by Bill Nighy, who is fast becoming one of my favorite actors.  Even though he is in the film sparingly, the few scenes he are in he completely takes over.  Nighy has a great ability seem inviting yet dangerous at the same time.<br /><br />Maybe the best part of The Constant Gardener, though, is its realism.  The ending is absolutely perfect for the film.  Some average movie-goers will probably be unhappy with the way film ends, but I admire the courage of a screenwriter/director to stick to his beliefs and end a film the best way he thinks possible.  The ending leaves you shaken, and thinking back on the whole film, and the importance of the subject matter at hand.  Believe me, I'm no bleeding heart, but this film did strike me in a way I did not expect it to.  It made me angry, it made me feel desperate, but most of all, it made me see how the world works sometimes, and how most of us are helpless to change the big scheme of things, but we can all do our small part.<br /><br />The movie is best summed up in a quote that is said twice during the film, once by Justin and once by Tessa.  In both situations they are trying to help a single, suffering African civilian, and are told that there are \\"thousands who need help, and this is only one,\\" to which they both reply: \\"But this is one we can help.\\"<br /><br />This is a great film.though, is its realism.

B000001Y5D|4.0|Linda Perry a female Robert Plant?  I thought that was Ann Wilson.  Well, actually, Linda is sort of Ann Wilson on steroids, so I guess it works out.  She's pretty ferocious anyway, even if her \\"alternative\\" cred is dubious in the hippest circles.  If you don't worry about such one-upmanship, you'll find much to enjoy on this one-shot release from the group I'll probably always confuse with Concrete Blonde.      Like so much rock music, the lyrics are clumsy on the lyric sheet but work fine in the context of the unrelenting music. Linda's vocals range from Chrissie Hynde cool (opening of \\"Train\\") to Wilsonian wailing.  I even hear touches of Judy Henske and Buffy Sainte-Marie, the two least prettified  60s folk madonnas (but still I have to wonder if Linda has actually heard either). More contemporary reference points would have to include 80s folkie-blues shouter Toni Childs.  Somehow though, the singer she evokes most for me is Grace Slick (especially the sardonic verging on punky Slick of the \\"Eat Starch, Mom\\" era), and it seems appropriate that these two powerhouse belters later hooked up for Linda's contribution to THE CROW:CITY OF ANGELS soundtrack (appropriately titled \\"Knock Me Out\\").    This one probably could have used a real ballad or two to balance things out.  (Closest would be the power ballad \\"Drifting.\\")  Even with a few slow songs, however, the power vocals would have alienated many listeners.  But hey, this is NOT  outre Yoko Ono or Patty Waters territory, gang.  This is rock'n'roll, and I pretty much like it.
0316172324|5.0|Great look at how a person's entire existence and experience can impact the snap judgments they make when faced with a decision, the book also does a nice job of giving encouraging a person to trust your instincts - unless of coarse you have very little background in the decision you are about to make. Fun read similar to Gladwell's other book tipping point.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity is obviously loved by those who are meant to see it. I think it's good science fiction, just not great science fiction. If you haven't seen the show Firefly (I've seen bit and pieces) the first half of the movie will probably come off as confusing and a little dopey. I think the last third of the film is a blast. The story is good, though not without problems, and the acting is good. The special effects are fantastic. I don't concider this great science-fiction like Minority Report or Blade Runner, but it will satisfy any genre fans for sure.
0783229364|5.0|1. A great lead actor: Michael J. Fox in the prime of his career, really drives this film, and makes it as enjoyable as it could possibly get.  I doubt any other actor of the time could have pulled this one off.  He plays someone trying to be the yuppie that Alex P. Keaton strived to be in the hit TV show Family Ties. <br /> <br />2. Excellent supporting cast: Robert Jordan and Margaret Whitton as Fox's uncle and aunt by marriage; and a good sidekick: John Pankow (Ira in TV's Mad About You) as Fox's mailroom, lowest on the office totem pole counterpart, who played off Fox very well.  I did find Helen Slater to be a little cold. <br /> <br />3. Euro chic cinematography: With Carlo Di Palma (Blow-Up, The Appointment, Hannah & Her Sisters) on board, the look of this film was several notches above other similar films of the timeframe.  Just look at some of the interesting shots in the film, including a scene where you see Robert Jordan in the mirror of a restaurant, while he's talking to Helen Slater with his back to the camera.  Little stylish elements like this really make it an enjoyable rewatch in the present day. <br /> <br />This one never went overboard with the sexual antics, and remained very innocent compared to the huge lot of other 80's R-rated romps.  It was also a few years ahead of just about every other teen film of the day, and I mean it in the sense that everyone else was in High School, while here we have a young man's journey on a career path after college.  This would also make it appealing to young adults who were otherwise too old for the John Hughes type movies. <br /> <br />The DVD is definitely worth adding to your 80's film collection, especially considering it's low price.  The extras are the trailer, cast bios, and some production notes.  Presentation is widscreen and the picture quality is high. <br /> <br />Some say it was very contrived, and I can't dispute that, but surely you can't overlook the entertainment value of this rather unique,yuppie, 80's gem.  A film truly tailored for the 80's MJF.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|The first ridiculous scene is during the descend on a planet in order to commit robbery. To begin with the spaceship was not challenged in any fashion by a traffic control, but today an airoplane simply can't fly between plases without being challenged by traffic controllers several times. But apparently in the future, nobody is interested in air and space traffic. That becomes even stranger, as this supposedly happens where there is lack of freedom and the regime is opressive, but such regimes are preciselly the ones that tend to police everywhere. Yet, no-one did pay any attension to theyr arrival apparently. <br /> <br />The captain approaches the planetary athmosphere at something like 40.000 km/h (but as every world in this story happens for some magical reason to have got a 1G gravity field approach speeds should be the same as for the Earth. That means the same minimum orbital speed of mac 24. Spaceships approaching the Earth therefore will have got that speed + plus theyr approach speed to the planet). As the descend is about to begin, the captain tells into the intercom that the main heatshield of the ship has just been lost. That means in plane language that the ship and its crew are doomed. The intense heat of entry will burn through the unprotected fuselage, the crew subsequently being fried alife, the ship at some point during the descend braking apart somewhat like one of the spaceshuttles did not such a long time ago. In the future though, perhaps, spaceships will be capable of great amount of acceleration, so perhaps in such an absolute emergency the captain might be able to redline the engines in order to quickly slow down beneath the dangerous speeds that do cause such the intense friction temperatures. However that would mean pulling in lots and lots of Gs. However during deceleration from the extremelly high entry speeds when everyone ought to have been plane unable to move from theyr acceleration coutches due to the intense G levels, the crew was a) not in acceleration coutches and b) was freely moving about the ship corridors like they were inside an oceanic cruise liner, not a rapidly decelerating spaceship and c) not one looked desperatelly worried even though they were all planely in very dire straits indeed. <br /> <br />What resulted was a somewhat boring scene instead of what could have been a highly exciting one. <br /> <br />Later they were chased by some reapers. They flew something which looked somewhat like a badly welded pickup bed and they were chased by something which looked somewhat like some of the chase veicles in Mad Max 1 or Mad Max 2, except that Mel Gibson's movies were far better and happened on Planet Earth, and the raw and ready looks had actually business being there. The weapons also looked somewhat similar to those used in the Mad Max movies, i.e projectile weapons incluting even a harpoon, so no futureistic weapons in the future eh. <br /> <br />The spaceship itself was completelly unairodynamic in outlook. Well, while spaceships do not strichtly speeking require airodynamics in space, the type which is designed to operate in air as well as in space most definitelly needs airodynamics. The podded engines, f.e., would inevitably have burned off during descend. <br /> <br /> <br />Well, this is just during the first 15 minutes of the movie. I could go on like this for several pages. This is simply by far the worst space movie I have ever seen. It is not just badly made, terribly acted, it isn't even stupit in the right manner; meaning sometimes movies are so bad they become funny for that reason. It does not even manage that. <br /> <br />I would rate it 0, but the site does not allow that. <br /> <br />Einar

B000B8QEZG|3.0|Madonna has played it safe with this album and made a somewhat generic dance record. The album is solid but Madonna's trademark creativity is mostly absent on Confessions. Evidentally this is the singer's attempt to remain commerically viable and unfortunately the music shows. Stuart Price has to be the least original producer Madonna has worked with in years. I feel the big problem with American Life, were the lyrics not the musical production.  The unique sound on that album is light years ahead of this practically by the numbers fluff. Confessions actually sounds as if it should have been released in the mid nineties and not in 2005. This was the album I was expecting Ray of Light to sound like. Unfortunately, Madonna has taken three steps back with this dated sound but I understand why she did it. American Life was a big commercial disappointment and Madonna has to counter with a safe record. Hopefully, after this CD puts Madonna back on top, she will then feel confident enough to take risks again with her next project. I find this album enjoyable but I don't admire it.
B000005DSN|4.0|The true bands best recordings are Fright Night,Dreamspace and Fourth Dimension. They have more creativity and originality.    When I bought this album and listened first I thought it was masterpiece, but I don't think it anymore. It's because of that god damn Jorg Michael's addiction to double bass drums that spoils these tracks: Legions ( despite the good melody ), Holy light ( this instrumental song isn't bad at all; Jens Johansson the keyboardist , playing harphischord, incredibly manages to follow Timo Tolkki in his turbo soloing, putting the musical notes at the same speed as him, Wow!) , Visions and Forever free  ( I hate these 2 songs , they suck! )  Another reason to hate Forever free is the chorus. Magnification.  Equal to Episode's (album) Father time.   Happily ,Jorg Michael, stopped with these annoying repetitions in the 2005 release. Now I forgive him.    These 3 songs are killer:    The Kiss of Judas:  The song that introduced me to Stratovarius.   It has the best drumming peformance by Jorg in the band's history to me besides his multiple flaws.   The solos ( keyboard and guitar) are really fabulous.  Surely it's one of most techically difficult guitar solos that Tolkki even invented. Watch him doing it at the clip and you'll see what I mean. He's a guitar monster, and one of my idols of this genre.  Another wonder in this track is the ending: the chorus in a different tone that gives a gorgeous feel. One of the best endings Strato ever done.    The abyss of your eyes: It starts with a muffled guitar.  No comments:very well played.The bridge and the ending are  amazing.    Coming home: The best ballad of Timo Kotipelto's times. Beautiful.    Black Diamond was one of the singles. The riffing is cool and enjoyable and fits perfectly with the harphischord. It's the   only one where the double bass drum doesn't disturb.  The chorus is another goodie.  \\" Paradise\\" is catchy.    Visions (1997 release) has more hits than mistakes and still worths your money.    Now I?ve listened to all studio albums and that?s my sincere opinion from best to worse:    1. Fright Night  2. Dreamspace / Fourth Dimension  3. Visions  4. Infinite / Elements part II / Stratovarius 2005  5. Intermission  6. Episode / Destiny  7. Twilight time  8. Elements part I    Buy in this order if you want to be a completist.It?s really difficult for these finnish to do a perfect record and Fright night came closer. You can see that 2 of the releases on the  top of the list are with Timo Tolkki on lead. The consistency of the songs overall was my standard.  The recipe to be perfect: the repetitive double bass drum loss was the first step , Timo Kotipelto is an extraordinary singer, but Tolkki could get more courage to sing together with him or do backing vocals at least,   put some more skilful guitar/ keyboard solos per album ,forget the ballads without electric guitar ( \\"drop in the ocean and celestial dream \\" - like ) and get back with that instrumental songs , with the same quality as Fire Dance or Stratovarius where Tolkki shows why he is number 84 in a list of the best guitarists of all time.  The worse mistake in the double bass drumming was the IDENTICAL rhythm in the songs:  Find your own voice and Father time ( arrgh ), anthem of the world, learning to fly , freedom ( not 100%,but close enough), glory of the world, legions, visions, tomorrow , speed of light , no turning back and stratosphere.

B000002UWE|5.0|Once people get over the 80's shame, forever linked with gated snares and haircuts, they will hear clearly that some of the best and most innovative music was written in that era. Standing in the midst of this was Mark Hollis and Talk Talk. This band used the flavour of the 80's as a carrier for their well crafted hooks and heart wrenching melodies, sung with the honesty of Hollis to produce such classics as It's my Life and My foolish friend. Anybody who compares these songs to Duran Duran clearly isn't listening well enough. But Talk Talk didn't stop there. They went on to produce jazz influenced albums that started off with the masterpiece, Colours of spring, with backing by Steve Winwood, and towards more obtuse but critically acclaimed offerings such as Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. You really can't go wrong with Talk Talk except, as others have mentioned, you might end up buying the entire catalogue. Go for it. Enrich your soul.
6305744793|4.0|This is a very funny film, with a great all star cast you get just what you expect, a great comedy.

I don't know if Uncle Fester is really their uncle or not.
0739308742|5.0|I,ve read hundreds of books, perhaps thousands, and very few were fantasy in nature due to the derivative nature of the genre. Martin, on the other hand puts it all together in an original way like few others, Tolkein, Donaldson, some of Williams work (mot muc), and Simmons when he ventures there. Surely I,m leaving some out that I have read and should not have forgotten to give credit to, most definitely I've missed some great ones to my loss, but Martin gets my credit where I believe it is due.

0375758992|3.0|I liked this book.  Not that it is brilliantly written, but the text reflects the fact that this story is being told in a simple way by a young girl living in an inhospitable land in constant stages of unrest. Alexandra Fuller conveys her unruly white rural African childhood with candor and sensitivity in an unsentimental way.  As you read the book you see her life through a child's eyes and the details and things that are important at each stage of her life, albeit in an environment very different from the normal american child.  <br /> <br />As the story goes (1972-1990), \\"Bobo\\" grew up on several farms in southern and central Africa. Both parents are unique, tortured and strongly independent.  I actually admired the strength and conviction of these British expatriates, even though I believe they were very human and made the mistakes that all parents do.  <br /> <br />This book is more than a biography or a survivor's story. It is the portrait of a young girl/woman with a strong unbreakable bond with a continent she calls \\"home\\" and it's people.  I can definitely relate to that bond with an environment you are spiritually linked too and yearn for.  It's a feeling you can't really describe to others nor want to justify, but just keep in your heart to treasure.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|[...]  Cabin Fever was one of the worse \\"horror\\" movies ever made.  It lack a story, character development, and had no plot.  The premise was completely preposterous, namely a flesh eating bacteria suddenly breaks out among a group of poor city slicker visiting the back woods of white-trash redneck-ville.  The stereotypes were trite and plastic, even genuinely racists to both whites and blacks.  Thus is the limitation of Eli Roth's talent for both writing and directing.    In Hostel, he does no better, only now substituting more blood and gore in a pathetic attempt to compensate for his blaring deficiencies as a writer and director of cinema.  Yet Roth seems to genuinely believe he has achieved something of greatness in showing, for instance, a woman strapped to a chair having her toes chopped off with a larger lock cutter.  This, we are to believe, is the height of  artistic talent and creativity.  Indeed, only the most scatologicial and undeveloped, vacant loser minds would find such poor garbage as this amusing.    The only thing that proves genuinely grotesque about this movie is Roth's appalling lack of imagination and most undeserved sense of accomplishment and unjustified pride in believing he has any talent other than to amuse adolescent, puerile teenage minds.      This movie was not horror nor horrifying an experience.  Compared to movies like Seven, which despite having little or no blood in it was far more frigthening and distrubing than Hostel for cleverly eliciting the viewer's sense of dread and own imagination to fill in the suggestive details, Hostel just inundates you with a barage of senseless, frenetic images that soon become formulaic and tedious.      Moreover, unlike Seven, which presented a very real scenario that didn't insult the intelligence of viewers and had skillful,  competent actors who actually acted, Hostel is premised on a very preposterous premise of a large underground torture and murder industry in which despite a large clientele of murders and ever amassng murder victims, no one is the wiser outside of the town in which these crimes take place and where everyone in the town just about is involved in the scheme--all the while presented by so-called \\"actors\\" who cannot act to quite literally save their own lives.  Even the supposedly \\"steamy sex scenes\\" (to borrow from the trite description so often said of the sex scenes), the acting is stiff (pardon the pun) and plastic.      You have no concern for the characters, except for perhaps one, an Icelander who is arguably the most sympathetic.  The movie then truly proves as a puerile excuse for genuinbely gratuitous lame and rather unerotic sex and female nudity and blood and gore.  You'd have a far better time renting a porno, then, and watching an Ultimate Fight match than seeing Hostel if that is watching cheap looking women acting like whorish fools and seeing blood blow is your sense of entertainment.    --Josh Evans Jr., Film Student

What he wrote was this memoir, which resurfaced after his speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention.  Obama, a Senator from Illinois, writes about his growing up years in Hawaii, his distant relationship with his father, his search for a cause after moving to Chicago, and finally, his embracing of his father's African roots. <br /> <br />This book is moving and eloquent, and even though Obama is not a writer, the narrative moves along at a decent pace.  I particularly resonated with his experiences in Hawaii - having lived there several years myself, I found it to be a difficult place to live, and inhospitable to those who \\"don't belong\\" on the islands.  I was also fascinated by the section dealing with his transition to Chicago.  It was a difficult time for him, and a really fine example of how people in their 20s struggle to create an identity for themselves.  Overall, an excellent read, and an unflinching portrayal of one African-American man's experiences with racism and identity.
B00003CWPL|4.0|Lynch stretched the boundaries of black & white film to their limits when making this film.  I've read he had to send parts back to the lab repeatedly because the techs kept \\"correcting\\" it on the assumption that he couldn't possibly have wanted what he asked for...  Consequently, there are scenes that contain extremely subtle images on film which frankly, don't reproduce worth squat in the more limited dynamic range of video.  If it wasn't for that I'd give it 5 stars.  This is the first movie you should use to test to see if HDTV and/or your new plasma TV has any better intensity range, and not just XY resolution.  It may not fare any better in HDTV than it does on NTSC/PAL if all they did is pump up the X & Y when then designed HD.    Otherwise, Lynch has successfully captured the surrealism of a nightmare, along with its disconnected logic and frightening imagery.  The extreme surrealism will no doubt throw many people off, but it's not by any means without plot or point.  It used to be my favorite film until I came to realize I now prefer more optimistic dream-surrealism-- my favorite film has since been Tuvalu, a film that tells its odd little story with far less dialog than Eraserhead (!), and quite a bit more heart.      With Eraserhead, Lynch kicked off (or helped to kick off) the \\"industrial\\" movement of the 1980s, bringing us new visions of the dark ages of the big cities around 1900 as the industrial revolution began, an updating of the environment in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.  Lynch also used much of this imagery in The Elephant Man, his second best work (after this one), noisy gas lamps, industrial accidents, the oily grime of the proto-industrial city.  Unfortunately, such scare tactics do not seem to have abated the continuing negative effects of industrialism on modern life in the slightest...    Addendum 09/2010:    A lot of the negative reviews on this site claim that there is \\"no plot,\\" that it is \\"abstract,\\" pointless, etc.  Frankly, I think there's very little in Eraserhead that has no point.   Certainly it is a nightmarish dream world, but most of it makes sense, if you're paying attention.  This includes things like the faulty electricity, the railroad references including the brakeman (and roller coasters used to use those kind of brakes), the woman in the radiator, the \\"premature\\" umbilical cords.   It is a dismal caricature of life as the recipient of an unplanned pregnancy.   Henry Spencer inhabits a bleak little universe in which everything is disfunctional, and he's completely resigned to it.   A dream that is so bad that it is short circuiting, going \\"off the tracks.\\"   And Lynch explores Henry's nightmare universe with a magnifying glass.  I'm sure for some people, their unexpected experience as a new parent is every bit as horrible as it is for Henry Spencer, in it's own way.       But despite the bleakness, Eraserhead is packed with droll humor.  It's clear that many people don't get or don't like droll humor (perhaps they should stick to movies like \\"Airplane\\" instead).  The symbolism is obviously over many of these reviewer's heads, or the references are a bit too obscure, or they just don't have the patience, or just don't find the absurdity of the Lynchian nightmare funny.  And  Lynch, like Kubrick, does not lead you around by the hand and explain everything to you as if you are a child.  Lynch's universe is completely at the other end of the spectrum than Walt Disney's.    One reviewer wrote, \\"A woman ululating for no apparent reason.\\"  Obviously, someone unfamiliar with epileptic seizure.   And combing the hair is an old home remedy, as it would calm the person.  If you've seen any other David Lynch films, you might have noticed that many of his characters have mental disorders or head injuries, it's one of his trademarks...
B0009ML238|5.0|I wish some prog listeners could look past bands' influences. Yes, Circus Maximus is heavily influenced by Dream Theater, but why does everyone make such a big deal of it? I've had this disc for over seven months now and each successive listen proved to be more rewarding. This is a fantastic debut from a young Norwegian band. It encompasses a wide variety of styles but always keeps them within the boundaries of melodic progressive metal. Vocalist Michael Eriksen is the type of singer every prog metal band would want to have. He has excellent range and killer phrasing. Sometimes I have to think of Geoff Tate circa Operation: Mindcrime, sometimes the amazing Tony Harnell from TNT, and even some AOR vocalists, but one thing remains: Eriksen sings everything with a heavy melodic focus and delivers amazing vocal harmonies throughout. Starting with one of the best album opener's of 2005, \\"Sin\\", he belts out jawdropping screams, impressive double vocals, and classic hard rock type of harmonies, whilst the band behind him produce some of the best composed riffs and melodies you'll ever find on a first album. The end of the song is highlighted by a frenetic interplay where every member gets his part to impress the listener.<br /><br />Central to the album are the keyboards played by Espen Stovo who has unfortunately left the band recently. Stovo provides an array of different sounds and tones, ranging from symphonic synth elements on \\"Alive\\" (he also duels wildly with guitarist Mats Haugen at the end) to majestic piano interludes and lots of 70's prog rock organs. On \\"The Prophecy\\" the band combines lush acoustic guitars with solemn piano and then abruptly breaks into a riff-laden prog number that is eventually underlied by a beautiful symphonic backdrop utilising a brief analog synth solo along the way. Likewise, the 19-minute title track features a delicately arranged keyboard orchestration in its slowly building intro before the Haugen brothers go into a thrash-inspired instrumental pasage with syncopated drum and guitar accents. Joined by thick bass rhythms, the three players dabble with a killer tech metal experimentation before they suddenly cut out lest Espen Stovo can offer a pretty synth lead akin to those on Flower Kings albums. Because this is a long song and the closing solo by Mats Hauglen is slighly neoclassical, \\"The 1st Chapter\\" has been labeled as a Symphony X clone by some, and while I can hear similarities, that's where the comparisons end as far as I'm concerned. Inspired by Roman history, \\"Glory of the Empire\\" is another lengthy tune conjuring up images of fierce battles, and displaying Michael Eriksen's most versatile performance. On this song, Eriksen first sounds like an 80's AOR singer during the folky synth lines in the intro before he shows us his Tate-like upper register vocals. The band's instrumental prowess is best presented on the complex \\"Why Am I Here\\", a song that I assume must be quite hard to pull off live. The chemistry between the guitars and drums, and the very heavy bass walk, all occasionally backed by sprinkles of keyboards, elevate Eriksen's majestic vocals to a higher level. This song is a work of multi-riffage and constant shifts between time signatures. More technical brilliance is executed on the instrumental track \\"Biosfear\\", which could compete with the best tech metallers out there. Haugen lays down choppy guitar licks right from the get-go, while his brother and Glen Mollen on bass form a strong rhythmic backbone to the song. However, once again, it is Storo's stunning keyboard work during the unison solo that makes this piece. Storo makes subtle references to 70's prog and plays beautiful Egyptian melodies on this one.<br /><br />Besides the amazing musicianship, booklet, and mixing job of Tommy Hansen, The 1st Chapter also deserves mention for its lyrical depth. Michael Eriksen is also a great lyricist. He explores dark themes on some of the songs. For instance, \\"Sin\\" is a study incrime, from the perspectives of both the criminal and victim, while on the acoustic guitar and synth-driven ballad \\"Silence From Angels Above\\", the lyrics portay the desperation of someone who kills his loved one and then seeks forgiveness and piece of mind through religion.<br /><br />2005 was a great year for prog metal bands. This disc is most essential to listeners who bought and enjoyed the last albums of Pantommind, Zero Hour, Sieges Even, Redemption, NovAct, Pagan's Mind, and Shadow Gallery.perspectives of both the criminal and victim, while on the acoustic guitar and synth-driven ballad \\"Silence From Angels Above\\", the lyrics portay the desperation of someone who kills his loved one and then seeks forgiveness and piece of mind through religion.     2005 was a great year for prog metal bands.

B00005JOQ9|5.0|Even though it's not directed by Tarantino, sure you can still find some Tarantino's uniqueness injected into this film, like whispering anchoring and playing his own flim like Pulp Fiction clip in part of this movie. Indeed, Tarantino is the executive producer of this film. About the movie, the plot is simple but the psychological effect is tremendous. Job well done! The only blemish is missing the clear shot of the harsh torture execution. It's always fast and blurry. As rated R - Restricted, it should be able to go much further and grosser. <br />
B00020X88O|5.0|Showgirls is a lost post-modern classic. While not quite up to the level of masterpiece, Starship Troopers, Paul Verhoeven succeeds again in making one of the most bizzarely atonal modern American films. Dealing in atonality and paradox(Nomi's bipolar mood swings, the films subversively unerotic nature given its subject, providing cheap titillation for his viewers and then savagely reminding them of rape, etc.) Verhoeven nimbly blows up the ugly Star is Born cliche and throws it in his audience's face. Thankfully, film scholars everywhere are beginning to see the light and have been favorably reexamining Showgirls and many other films by Verhoeven, declaring them to be the stunning classics that they are.
B000002KDO|4.0|\\"cough-cough-cough-cough....a-hack...a-hack...a-hack...a-hack\\". And so begins the ridiculous hymn to pot \\"Sweet Leaf\\". There are lines like \\"you introduced me to my mind\\", which reflects an adoration that should be given to the Almighty, or at least somebody's lover. Someone chose this waste of five minutes to kick off this album when it shouldn't even have been on it. A shame, because this album has a lot of great material. The cautionary \\"After Forever\\", aimed at people who know nothing about what happens after Judgement Day and could care less. This sort of mentality gets the Commandments removed from courthouses and young girls booted out of school for saying a prayer over the stadium PA at a school game, and Ozzy and Tony were ahead of their time taking aim at it this far back. \\"Children Of the Grave\\" is sort of a companion piece--if you think only of the here and now, you're in a heap o' trouble when it ain't now no more. \\"Lord Of This World\\" is Satan, pure and simple, and I hope you aren't mentally hearing that sentence in the brilliant Dana Carvey's Church Lady voice. You sit back and let that mother take over, that's the main Sin Of Omission. I think it was at this stage that B/S started showing up on stage wearing crosses. \\"Into the Void\\" is a familiar theme--hop a spaceship to escape the evil of the world, but I think this was the first time that was done in popular music. The instrumentals \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\", which I think predated Led Zeppelin in bringing acoustic guitar to hard rock. The problem was that piezoelectric pickups hadn't been invented yet, so neither sounds very acoustic by today's standards. Probably DeArmond or Barcus-Berry pickups were used here, when they should have just miked Tony's box. He was never as skillful as Jimmy Page, but you have to admit this album shows just as much imaginativeness as Zep's \\"Zoso\\".

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Here's a challenge for you: Try watching this movie *without* comparing it to the 1995 miniseries. While the miniseries was fabulous, there's much to love in this movie.  <br /> <br />The chemistry between the two leads is remarkable. Matthew MacFadyen's Mr. Darcy smolders and suffers with his love for Elizabeth Bennet. He literally made me sigh (and nearly swoon). And Keira Knightley is fresh, energetic and lovely in the role of Miss Bennet. <br /> <br />The scenery made me want to catch a flight to England and find a misty moor to wander. The soundtrack strikes a perfect note throughout. The supporting cast is everything it should be. <br /> <br />So forget for a second the 1995 version. Forget for a moment more the ways the screenplay strays from Miss Austen's words. And then enjoy a sweet, rich, heart-warming love story that stands the test of time.
0670033375|1.0|I tried to go into this with no preconceptions carried over from my long perusal of \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".  I tried to make my mind a blank slate and just take \\"Collapse\\" at face value.  I don't know if I was successful or not, but I came to the same conclusion.  Jarred Diamond has one story to tell, and he's going to tell it over and over.      The thesis here is that environmental degradation is the root of societal collapse; that wars and strife and famine and rapine and the erasure of a civilization come not from human strengths or weaknesses in statecraft and technology, but because they cut down their trees or peed in the creek one time too many.  This is ludicrous on its face.  If Egypt was so used up and wasted, then why did another culture step right in behind it and do things the Egyptians never dreamed of?  If an untrammeled ecosystem is really what it's all about, why is Iceland such a nice place to live?  It's a denuded rock in the howling North Atlantic, ripped by volcanoes and without enough topsoil to grow a turnip, except for what the busy, brilliant Icelanders have made themselves.      It would be too easy to go on and on with a dozen handy examples of ways that this thesis just doesn't work.  My favorite howler is the thought that apple trees depleted the Montana soil.  Nothing a little manure and a hoe won't fix.      I don't know if there will be a recognizable America 500 years from now.  But I do know that, if there isn't, it won't be because someone in Bozeman forgot to fertilize his apple trees.
B00003CXXR|4.0|A surprisingly good film considering it is the third in the series, Jurassic Park III, provides another take on the well known by now paleontologist and of course... the dinosaurs!  When Alan Grant is contacted by a wealthy couple to act as a guide on an aerial tour over the restricted island of Sorna things are not all that they seem... <br />Sam Neill, Tea Leoni, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie. <br />On the negative side, the 11-year old surviving for 8 weeks on Isla Sorna is ridiculous to say the least, not to mention his overly confident attitude throughout the movie!  <br />In addition, Allesandro Nivola's character is not all that interesting and that takes away from the enjoyment.  In the end you kind of wish he hadn't made it... <br />In short, the plot is average, while the setting, the special effects, and the music are EXCELLENT!   <br />Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching and one to consider adding to your movie collection!  <br />
B00000K31V|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the book \\"eXistenZ\\" written by David Cronenberg.  Cronenberg also wrote the screenplay, directed, and was one of the producers of this movie.<br /><br />The movie occurs in the near future where computer game designers are worshipped like superstars and players can enter inside the games.<br /><br />The virtual reality game alluded to in the title of this review is called eXistenZ which was designed by Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  Players can enter the game via a \\"bioport\\" (essentially, \\"a hole in the [player's] spine\\").  A connection is made where one end of an umbilical cord is attached to the bioport and the other end is attached to the game proper (called a game pod--a synthetic, seemingly organic device).  The game runs on the energy of the body's nervous system and can tap into the player's mind.<br /><br />Forced to flee a failed assassination attempt from another computer company, Allegra teams up with a person named Ted Pikul (Jude Law) who becomes her unintended bodyguard.  Allegra asks Ted to test the game with her and we see through Ted how the game works.  To convey to you how the game actually works, here are some actual things Ted says to Allegra:<br /><br />(1) \\"I'm not sure...I'm not sure, where we are, is real at all.  This feels like a game to me.\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"I'm feeling a little disconnected from my real life.  I'm kinda losing touch with the texture of it.  You know what I mean?  I actually think there's an element of psychosis involved here.\\"<br /><br />(3) \\"We're both stumbling around together in this uninformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or even possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces we don't understand.\\"<br /><br />The movie becomes a bit tedious as we are going through the game's world.  In fact, it took me awhile to figure out what was going on and I thought the movie was kind of strange and confusing, especially at first.  But I stuck with it until the end and in its fantastic double climatic ending everything is explained (more or less).  I suspect that those who gave this movie a low rating did not stick with it and gave up on it too quickly.  (This is the biggest mistake you can make when viewing this movie.)<br /><br />The acting of this movie is very good.  Both Leigh and Law carry the movie.  There are seasoned actors like Ian Holm and Wilem Dafoe that, even though they have small parts, give memorable performances.<br /><br />This movie has some of the gore associated with Cronenberg's movies.  Thus, this movie is not recommended for the queasy.<br /><br />This is not only a science fiction movie.  It is filled with corporate espionage, virtual reality gaming (as mentioned),  suspenseful elements, technology, physiology, psychology, and even sexual metaphor.  It can also be thought of as a black comedy on computer games and those who play them.  (Some of the actors probably broke up laughing.)<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone.  Those who are not patient and who like a movie to tell you everything as it goes along will not like it.

6305511055|3.0|A good suspenseful movie about the spy game.  Redford plays a CIA analyst who comes back from lunch [the diner is still on Lextington ave.] and everyone in the office has been murdered.  The intent of the movie is to show us how evil the CIA can be, typical Hollywood left wing propoganda of the time, 1975.  The CIA thinks someone in the office is a double agent so everyone must go.  I hope they would be this efficient today. This movie wants the government to play fair in a very ruthless cold-war world.  Redford just wants out but he doesn't know who to trust, and it appears the best result for the shadow government is to elimate Turner played by Redford.  The idea is that our government will do whatever is needed to maintain our way of living as will all other governments, even killing innocent people to protect us.  Boy I hope so.  Did the CIA lie to President Bush to get us into Iraq?  This is a suspenseful and entertianing film with a good cast Faye Dunaway, Max Von Sydow and Cliff Robertson.  Where is this CIA today, instead of arresting terrorists they should be dumping them in land fills.

B00005JKTF|3.0|\\"Always remember who you are not.\\"  \\"Soon,\\" our heroine Charlotte Gray is told, \\"you'll transform yourself from who you are now into somebody entirely different.\\"  So when Cate Blanchett's character is air dropped into occupied France (24 minutes into the film) a member of the French resistance asks, \\"You are...?\\"  \\"Dominique Guilbert,\\" the 'former' Miss Gray responds, as they remove her from her parachute.  \\"Welcome to France, Dominique.\\"  Thus begins her work as a British agent; having told her lover earlier that she too wanted to be brave, thus when her soldier-friend goes missing in France she decides to follow.  She had studied French when she was younger so they presumed that she could pass herself off as a Parisian.  For effect, in the beginning of the film, Miss Blanchett does utter some words of French, but not a word of it while in France itself.  Apparently, the makers of this film thought it be better if we only made believe all were speaking French (as all the characters speak nothing but English; or, I should say, all of the French and British characters, for the Germans do utilize their native tongue on occasion. Late in the film, for example, a Vichy French hack asks this of Michael Gambon's character: \\"Do you have a certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race?\\"  Then tells him that \\"the aim of collaboration is, and always has been to safeguard the independence of French citizens.\\"  Simply put, such dialogue in English loses its import in my opinion. There's a fine Czech film about World War Two (Dark Blue World) that starts in Czech and thence when that film's characters make it to England intertwines Czech and English throughout the remainder of the film.  I wish they would have done likewise with \\"Charlotte Gray.\\"  An above average film (such as this one is) set in war-torn France simply ought to have some French in it, I should think.  It would have improved the film, in my opinion.  Notwithstanding this criticism, \\"Charlotte Gray\\" still (albeit barely) works as a film.  A bit more authenticity, though, would have immeasurably improved it. Cheers!eit barely) works as a film.  A bit more authenticity, though, would have immeasurably improved it. Cheers!  <br />
0393317552|1.0|I listened to this (unabridged version) twice, once casually, the second time carefully.  The first time I really enjoyed it, and thought he was plowing new ground.  But there were nagging doubts...thoughts that would not go away.  And so I listened again, and it seemed less logical the harder I pondered it.  As everyone knows, Diamond's thesis is (basically) that the \\"winners\\" in the game of life (we westerners and a few Asian societies) got that way not through hard work and dedication, through discipline and having a flexible yet strong culture that encourages growth and values the individual.  No, we basically lucked in to our success.  It is for this reason that there are no skyscrapers in wildest Borneo, that the tribesmen of New Guinea do not have cellphones and satellite TV. <br /> <br />This is an intoxicating thought to those who, a little or a lot, loathe the West.  But the logical inconsistencies are so blatant that, once Diamond's satin prose has worn off, they cannot be explained away easily.  Why are today's winners yesterday's losers?  Why did France go from howling backwater, to a powerful empire that covered the globe, back to its present state as nearly bankrupt social welfare state?  Surely climate and topography, soils and water, did not change THAT much from the period of AD 1000 to AD 2000.  The same can be said for Britain, Rome, Venice, and on and on.   <br /> <br />Diamond is an outstanding writer - I mean truly gifted.  He makes the humdrum spring to life.  He chooses examples and asks questions that are compelling and fun to read and think about.  But it would be very easy (witness all the happy, glowing reviews) to stop there.  I don't pretend to fully know why the West won, but it has.  Hands down.  There is a crescent of commercial success rimming the Pacific, but every winter the hot new flu comes from China for a good reason - millions of people in China still live with their livestock, and this in a culture that once put the empiresof Europe to shame.   <br /> <br />Some cultures get it, others don't.  Maybe it's as simple as that.  An illustration: in the world of sailing and sailboats, there is a body of sailors that admire the \\"junk\\" rig, used on Chinese junks.  There are those that scoff at it, preferring the traditional western sail plans.  One wag of a writer put it best, \\"The Europeans sailed to China hundreds of years ago.  The Chinese haven't sailed to Europe yet.\\"  An oversimplification, but one that bears thought.  Diamond's book deserves thought, too.  And the more thought you give it, the more you'll see he started with a conclusion, and wrapped a book around it.  That's not the way we got where we are today, and Diamond should know that.  But then, I suspect he just doesn't \\"get it.\\"
B00005MP58|4.0|While I did truly enjoy this version of Pride and Prejudice, which I have seen in both VHS and DVD( I own the DVD),I prefer the 1985 BBC release starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, which I own in both versions. <br />My first reason involves the language used, the script and the dialogue. Fay Weldon does wonders in recreating the language of the original book. Many of Austen's keenest observations of human absurdity can only exist in her own words in a verbal form. The 1985 version retains many of her most famous observations in their entirety. The Firth-Erle version does not retain enough of the original language. <br />The second reason is that Harker is not pretty enough to be the Jane to Erle's Elizabeth. This is very annoying! One of the most important plot points is that Jane is the prettiset of the Bennet girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent, rational and sensible of the girls and she is her father's favorite; but she is NOT prettier than Jane. Harker is also not believeable as a sweet, lovable girl. She is herself too intelligent and she cannot disguise that quality. All in all. Harker as Jane was a poor piece of casting <br />Thirdly, while I adore Colin Firth as a Romantic hero, he does not have enough reserve or stateliness to play Darcy. He does not conceal his passions well enough. I still like him, but he is not perfect in the role as David Rintoul is perfect. <br />There are many fine performances of more minor roles in both productions that make both of them worth viewing. I recommend the Lady Catherines in both productions, the Mr. & Mrs. Bennets, the Mr. Collins and many others.
1573223026|4.0|Suicide doesn't particularly evoke comedy in one's mind, nonetheless I found myself laughing at the honest and poignantly true observations of the four characters. In A Long Way Down, Nick Hornby addresses things people might believe or think about in regards to religion, having a special needs child, divorce, music, relationships, families, fame, cheating, and all types of other life issues. He says what people are afraid to say through his characters, especially Jessica, the teenager, who in my opinion is the most annoying. That has to be my only gripe about the book having to read and put up with her often rude observations. Even though I don't like overly introspective novels this was one I did enjoy and highly recommend.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Okay, first of all I'm a huge Jane Austen fan, as many are.  I've read everything she has written and have watched every movie I can get my hands on that is even loosely based on her novels.  Having said that, I'm not one to get into the realism of each scene and whether or not it was historicaly accurate.  I loved the movie.  Until the end.  I loved the cast and thought they did a brilliant job.  Until the end.  Was I the only person who was left in the theater going \\"That was the end?  Are they kidding?\\"  There was no kiss, no joyous words of love exchanged, nothing. You wait the whole film to see the end and they just cut it off, like they ran out of money or time and had to end it right there.  I'm all for leaving things to the imagination, but that was just mean.  How could they not kiss?!  There's no culmination of the love that has been built between them.  I left this movie feeling like something great had been built up and then just ripped away. Am I the only one who felt this way?  I can't imagine I am, but   I was disappointed when I left. So, great movie, bad ending. Or, lack of an ending, really.
0689878451|5.0|I got my copy of the book just days before the NYT article saying that the daddy penguins split up. It didn't make the sweetness of the story any less.  <br /> <br />I want my children to grow up knowing that there are a lot of different kinds of families in the world, and this is a charming, non-preachy example of one kind of family that you don't see in too many childrens' books.  <br /> <br />The illustrations are soft and attractive, and would probably appeal more to an older little one than to a baby or early toddler.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I must have watched this ten times when it played on Showtime back in the late 70's and having just recently purchased it on dvd I am glad to see it not only holds up to my fond childhood memories but it worked on my girlfriend, passing the generational test. We had a blast watching this film for its 70's conception of the future and stay young til you die theme--this is the first time I've seen the film since I was a kid, and the little button in the palm of my hand would have blinked red seven years ago, so it made a different impression on me than it did when I was 10! Yikes!<br /><br />The amazing costumes and set design look every bit as good today as when this premiered WAY back in the late 20th century and, aside from some unconvincing matte  work in the second half of the film, the special effects hold up remarkably well, too.<br /><br />I was thrilled at the picture and sound quality of this disc;the digitally remastered soundtrack was a serious treat for my rock and roll damaged ears!  Anyone who saw this growing up will want it on dvd and they won't be disappointed with the goods offered here. Bravo.
0792843584|5.0|After being totally wrecked by studio executives,and crucified by the Hollywood press,this work of art emerges as one of the most magnificent films ever made. The wealthy cattlemen thought they had a right to own thousands of acres of land while keeping the immigrants off of it. My review title is a quote from one of the mercenaries when he sees the attack strategy used by the homesteaders. The battle sequence is not too long. Cimino gets the last laugh.
B0006U4UAU|5.0|i am constantly looking for new and original audio entertainment. at the local misik store recently, the disco ball on the cover caught my eye and i said, \\"hey, let's give it a try\\". F*#$%CKING blown away. In some ways LCD is like Scissor Sisters in how they change and evolve with each song, each new rhythmn , never letting the listener know what to expect next. They have a hint of Franz Ferdinand in there, and exquisite lyrics (circa Postal Service and Death Cab for Cutie). I was just blown away and can't take it out of my cd player. I am hyping it to all I know who like genuinely unique, real, but totally fun tunes. It deserves nothing less than 5 stars...and i must confess, i burn a good share of music, but this deserves to be bought (even though I feel there that there are very few new musik acts who I would waste $20 bucks on). This one does, folks. It's got something for everyone, and even the stuff/styles that you think that you may not like you eventually will.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|With the recent release of their 7th album, \\"See You On The Other Side\\", KoRn has increased <br />the size, variety and tone of their musical career. KoRn (minus one member) released their hit <br />single \\"Twisted Transister\\" to a nation of skeptical critics that believed's Head's (Brian Welch) <br />departure meant the end for the gorup who started the nu-metal genre. To the dismay of dubious critics <br />and pleasure to a multitude of fans, See You On The Other Side is a smash hit. <br />With this album, KoRn have opened the doors to even more creativity and disarray. The result is <br />the most revolutionary KoRn album since their debut, a barb wired, bastard son of blinding musical <br />fury, dark and twisted lyrical cander, and searing, sociopathic tendencies.It's the culmination of <br />everything KoRn have come to represent musically, morphed with an industrial-strength alter ego that's <br />been suppressed--until now. The band is at its deftest on \\"Getting Off,\\" \\"Politics\\" and \\"Coming Undone,\\" <br />which highlight the industrial bend. Stalwart fans need not worry for \\"Liar\\" and \\"For No One\\" remain in <br />lock-step with classic Korn. \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is more than the evolution of KoRn--it's an <br />evolution of heavy.
B000002UAO|4.0|I know this is a matter of taste and what you're used to but I do not like the UK version as much as the American version. In my opinion, \\"Drive My Car\\" belongs on \\"Yesterday...and Today,\\" while \\"Nowhere Man\\" is always linked in my mind with \\"Yellow Submarine\\". I realize that the UK version was the way that The Beatles and (probably) George Martin intended the album to be but I will always love the American version more. I have a difficult time listening to \\"Rubber Soul\\" without \\"I've Just Seen a Face.\\" If you feel the way that I do than I suggest that you compile your own American version of this GREAT album with either purchased individual songs or you can buy this and make your own American version by buying just \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" and \\"It's only Love.\\" As far as I understand it the American version is not available on CD. To me, the American version is the sound of my childhood, the sound of the 60s/70s as far as I experienced it in Berkeley (where everyone else had the American version). Believe me, I am not being patriotic. It's very easy now to say that the best \\"Rubber Soul\\" is the UK version but some of us aren't so pretentious. I know that everyone loves \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" but I feel that the American version of \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" are the best albums by the Beatles.
0062502182|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" by Paulo Coelho is a quick, intriguing and refreshing read about a boy's journey to find his Personal Legend.  This book is beautifully written in the manor that it can be whatever the reader needs it to be.  It can be a simple or deep and insightful - it's purely up to the reader's discretion.  Also, I think that there are a lot of messages in this book.  For me, the theme of not giving up on your dreams even if an easier path is presented to you hit home but that's not the only message there.  I think that the relevant theme will strike each person differently and that's what's so wonderful about this book.  I highly recommend this book for anyone.  It's a quick and likeable read even if you're not into extracting deep meanings out of books.  Besides that, it's a short book that doesn't take long to get through so even if you don't like the book when it's all said and done, it will not have taken much time out of your life to read.
B000002IGV|5.0|Twisted Sister released one of the best metal albums in the 80s and achieved mainstream success with \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", \\"I Wanna Rock\\" and \\"The Price\\" and the rest of the album is brilliant.  However, Twisted Sister failed to capitalize on the success of this album with Love is for suckers and Come out and play.  Twisted Sister released a great album here and it is a masterpiece.  They are not responsible for the start of hair metal.  No way!  That is Van Halen, Poison, Motley Crue, and Guns N' Roses.  Twisted Sister might have been successful in the early 80s.  I will give Twisted Sister credit for two of the most influential videos in metal history and even Michael Jackson ripped off Twisted Sister for one of his videos. <br /> <br />Twisted Sister's Stay Hungry is a great album- but they are not responsible for hair metal.  It could be said that Twisted Sister is over-rated. <br />
0767821629|2.0|I'm getting really tired of saying this about movies, but this yet another movie that had an interesting idea, but poorly executed. That preceding sentence may as well be my username. In this case, it wasn't the overall thread of the story that was the problem, but individual scenes that were so unrealistically written/directed that I unfortunately have no choice but to assume that the movie makers were either 1) on drugs, or 2) just got off drugs.<br /><br />There's never been a movie where I look at the story and say, \\"ok, that's just not believable, this story is just too over the top to take seriously.\\" I never say that. I'll respect any story someone wants to tell me as long as the movie follows some sort of internal logic, and has its characters reacting and interacting with their world in a manner that approaches some semblance of realism. This movie lacked exactly that, here are some examples:<br /><br />-When Ashton first finds out from Hall that his world is not real, he becomes *extremely* hostile and is ready to kill Hall. Why are you in such a hurry to off the ONE GUY that can give you more insight into this unbelievable revelation? You'll of course feel angry, but wouldn't you want to get more information on this first before you murder him, if you still plan on going that route?<br /><br />-One of the characters explained to Hall that when he was driving down the highway and eventually stopped, he was completely terrified by what he saw ahead of him (referring to the digital holographic structure that Hall would eventually see). Umm, a sane person would ask the next obvious question: \\"WHAT DID YOU SEE?\\" Why would you not ask that obvious followup question? Don't you want to know what he was so terrified by? Instead Hall keeps that same stupid worried look on his face.<br /><br />-When Hall is talking with the girl in the grocery store, the girl eventually asks, \\"you're not from around here, are you?\\", and tells Hall that he looks familiar. What the hell. If he looks familiar, then why is she assuming that he wouldn't be from around here? What kind of person even talks like that? Who was the script supervisor? Did they even have one, or was he one of the people on drugs?<br /><br />-When one of the characters gets pulled over by a cop, the cop asks for his driver's license. The character tells him he forgot it at home. The cop then says, \\"check your glove box.\\" When was the last time you got pulled over, tell the cop you don't have your license/registration, and have the cop suggest you check your glove box? Give me a break, that was just an amateurish attempt at building suspense since we find out a second later that there's a gun in the glove box.<br /><br />Yeah, thinking about this movie makes me angry.at the hell. If he looks familiar, then why is she assuming that he wouldn't be from around here? What kind of person even talks like that? Who was the script supervisor?

B000BTC5LW|5.0|...somebody issued a DVD version of the PULSE Laserdisc so I was able to see this excellent concert, as I missed out on the original VHS and Laserdisc releases over 10 years ago.  I pre-ordered this official DVD and am patiently waiting for it's arrival, as I watch the bootleg at least once a week. <br />The CD soundtrack is quite different from the music in the DVD, as other reviewers have noted.  The new 5.1 soundtrack on the upcoming  DVD is probably the cause of the delay in relase of the official DVD of PULSE.
B00006AW2M|5.0|I got to tell ya I am as big a Stones fan as anyone else and I feel that this album is one of their BEST. It is different than any stones album and that is what makes so appealing. If you take any stones album after Mick taylor left the band, they would all sound the same,So for argument sake let's forget those albums with Ronnie Wood.Satanic is not a ROCK N ROll album , it is an experiment of sounds.The guitar sounds, and riffs on this album were never repeated again by keith, some would say that is good, I do not.If I were deserted on a beach and had to take 2 stones albums they would be-Satanics Majesty's, and Get yer Ya ya's out!
B000000OUW|5.0|There is one song in the album that I thought was going to a piano ballad and then it immediately picks up steam and momentum. The only problem I had with this album is one song that sounded like noise and an instrumental seemed out of place. It is a great album and worth listening to.  Manowar's Louder Than Hell is an awesome album!! <br />
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Let me start by saying I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  It is one of the few movies I can watch over and over.  I remember as a child when I had the chicken pox over christmas break, and I must have watched this movie a hundred times.  The story is wonderful, and in my opinion even though it is often times lumped in with family movies instead of musicals, it has to be one of the best musicals ever made.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were made for their roles.  The little children were wonderful as well.  The supporting cast is made up of the Walt Disney stable of actors that he used over and over again, but you really don't notice because they are all such good character actors they make their parts real to the viewer.<br /><br />You will love the animated scenes and the fox hunt is just crazy!<br /><br />This specific DVD version is the best because the behind the scenes stuff and documentries are great as they explain the animation, and how they painted the beautiful london cityscape on glass.  The Disney fanatics should also buy this as they will get a special peek into the Disney movie machine that isn't usually shown on camera.<br /><br />On my personal top list of all time I rate it #15<br /><br />So get this movie and watch it again and again and again!
0780020685|5.0|This is the overwhelming theme of this epic movie. The Samurais are decent people falling on hard times. But once they realize that saving this village is a task of honor and nobility they accept the job for next to nothing. Despite financial hardship they take up this mission because their sense of morality and honor trumps any material gain. This really is one of the best movies ever made and watching the Samurai transition from apathetic mercenaries to caring and noble heroes is a tale for the ages.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer really does debut with a bang. The Blue Album is absolutely fantastic. It is pure Rock with elements of Punk thrown in. With songs like \\"Say It Ain't So\\" and \\"Undone\\", how can this album do anything but Rock?!<br /><br />I have been a fan of Weezer for many years and I recommend that everyone who is interested in this incredible band buy this record first. This is Weezer in it's rawest form and it definitely has excellent songs. My personal favorite song on the deluxe edition is Susanne. Some other greats are No One Else and In The Garage. So many fantastic songs, it's hard to pick favorites. A brilliant Rock album.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I recently saw this movie after hearing all the hype and hooplah  about it. You know what? There isn't enough hype and hooplah about it!!!!! Get it more publicity and out of the \\"closet\\" so everyone can enjoy it. Fantastic scenery, excellent casting, wonderful soundtrack, and a storyline as beautiful as it is controversial makes Brokeback Mountain a classic before its time. Ang Lee did it again. The story is about deep love and devotion (who cares if it is between 2 men?) and how no obstacle can stand in the way of it. You soon forget that the two people in love are same sex and concentrate on the aspect that even though forbidden, they manage to endure obstacles that prevent them from being together permanently from living in different states, loveless marriages, nagging in-laws, money, and the fear of being \\"found out.\\" I found my self both empathizing and sympathizing with Ennis & Jack on their quest to happiness. I was totally numb and glued to my seat and could not move at the ending! I sat there in tears as the credits rolled by wanting to see more and hoping it would have ended happily. The last film I cried in was \\"The Notebook,\\" another credit to everlasting love. Yes, men do cry at films; there is nothing wrong with that. I say if you can cry at a film, then the director made his point and the actors earned their keep. The love scenes between the two men were very tastefully done and not shock value for the sake of selling tickets -- it again reiterated the story line of pent up emotions that finally erupted and were long overdue. Heath and Jake were perfectly matched in their roles. I was so moved I bought the soundtrack, the book, and am waiting for the DVD to be released to ad to my collection. This film is a \\"must-see\\" even if you are not open-minded to the topic of the plot -- see it for what it is worth -- entertainment from a top-notch director bringing a short story to life specatularly.
B00004YA66|4.0|\\"Frequency\\" is one of my wife's favorite movies, and it's one of mine to.  The movie intorduced Dennis Quaid to me all over again, and Jim Caveezel for the first time.  I thought both of these actors did an outstanding job in their roles.<br /><br />The catch line is \\"what if?\\"  What if your life took a turn in a totally different direction?  What if someone in your life who died when you were young, didn't.  How different would your life be?  This movie says loudly,your life would be very different.  I really enjoyed this movie, it had a pretty suspenseful plot line, and some comedic scenes as well.<br /><br />The song you here in the background throughout the movie is \\"Suspicious Minds\\" by Elvis, and centers around the World Series with the \\"Amazing Mets\\".  With that as the backdrop the movie is a modern day fairy tale of \\"what ifs\\" come to life that every child probably dreams about every night in bed.
B000089RVX|5.0|No matter what others will say, Evanescence is truly a great band. They somehow made their way into this mess of mainstream music even with their beautiful, unique sound (it's unique to MTV, anyway!). Mainstream rock bands, such as Evanescence, do not normally have female vocalists either, so that adds to it all. It's really neat, actually - the idea that a band this good would get the recognition that they do! <br />Onto Fallen though! It's a brilliant debut album, I can tell you that. In my honest opinion, there isn't one skippable song on this CD. Amy Lee has an absolutely amazing voice, the lyrics are very pleasing and deep, every song differs from the next, and the music blends so perfectly... If you don't at least try out this album, then you are missing out on a lot, for sure! Evanescence's music can be enjoyed by almost anyone. :) <br />Here's a song-by-song review of Fallen by none other than me (but you wouldn't have guessed that, right?). I like reading these things so I've decided to make one for other people like me to enjoy. Haha. <br /> <br />1. Going Under -- (4/5 stars) <br />Very nice way of opening Fallen! It's a catchy song, actually. I really love the guitars in it, and the fact that there's some nice piano music hidden in there makes me happy, too. :D It may not be the best track on the album, but it's definitely worth a listen (or a few listens...). Actually, if you can, try to view the video for this song! It's creepy... In a good way, of course. <br /> <br />2. Bring Me to Life -- (4/5 stars) <br />In my opinion, this song is so overplayed! What's unfortunate is, if they hadn't literally played this song everywhere possible, then it would've had a very good chance at being the best track on this CD. It's still a great song, don't get me wrong! It just would've been better if I hadn't heard it hundreds of times before buying the album. :) In reality, everything about this song (even the male vocals) is strung together very nicely. Even if Ihave heard it more than enough times, I never skip it when listening to this CD. <br /> <br />3. Everybody's Fool -- (4/5 stars) <br />I find the choir throughout this song very nice - it adds to the song tremendously. The lyrics give you something to think about, too, which is good. Overall, this track is definitely above average, but if you listen to it too many times (which can easily happen), then it certainly does get old. So try not to do that. ;) Oh, and the video for this song is amazing, as well. Definitley check it out. <br /> <br />4. My Immortal -- (5/5 stars) <br />The first time I listened to this song, I cried. No joke - it literally brought tears to my eyes, and not too many songs can do that. It's a very, very beautiful song. And, I much prefer this version over the \\"band version\\" from the video. A sudden blast of loud instruments is just what this song doesn't need! It's an incredible song, and it doesn't require and ounce of rock in it to please listeners. :) <br /> <br />5. Haunted -- (4/5 stars) <br />Sounds silly, but this song kind of freaked me out when I first listened to it! Haha. The music, the lyrics, the vocals... The title defines this song very well because it really does sound \\"haunted.\\" It's a very unique song, and it's not hard to get into the mood that it tries to create. It's the shortest track on the CD, but it's definitely not the worst! It's delightfully spooky, as well, which is just my taste, hehe. <br /> <br />6. Tourniquet -- (3/5 stars) <br />Technically, this is the only apparently Christianity-based song on Fallen, though it is rather nice to listen to. I know a lot of people that really like this song, but it's not as appealing to me. In fact, I find it to be the track I like the least. Though, I do like Amy's screaming of, \\"I long to die!\\" Haha, I'm weird like that, but I think it sets the mood quite effectively. And the end of this song nicely merges into... <br /> <br />7. Imaginary -- (5/5 stars)  <br />...Imaginary! Definitely one of the best tracks on this CD, without a doubt. It's beautiful, powerful, and I, personally, can relate to the lyrics with ease. The music literally puts you into a \\"field of paper flowers with candy clouds of lullaby.\\" They've just about perfected this song, honestly. It easily gets five stars from me. <br /> <br />8. Taking Over Me -- (4/5) <br />At first, this song might seem rather average (it did to me), but if you pay closer attention to the music, you'll find that it is quite far from average, indeed! Everything goes together very smoothly in this song. The lyrics might strike one as being influenced by Christianity, but even if they were, they're quite a deal more subtle than Tourniquet's, and you can interpret them in any way you choose. <br /> <br />9. Hello -- (5/5) <br />Oh, this song is beautiful. The lyrics are sad, and the music supports that well. It's another song almost completely held up, music-wise, by piano. I can't even put it into words, really... It may be the best song on this album, in my opinion. <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath -- (4/5) <br />I have a bit of an attachment to this song, but it's still a very different and enjoyable track either way. The music is very unique, I think, and the lyrics are very poetic. This song's got more of an orchestral sound to it, really. It's a beatiful blend of sounds, no doubt. <br /> <br />11. Whisper -- (3/5) <br />A song about fear... Hey, I can totally relate! Haha. Well, I have to say, it's not a horrible song by any means, it just sort of lacks something. Can't really say what, though. The choir really helps the song move along, and especially the chanting in Latin (I think?) at the very end makes this song what it is. And, really? It ends Fallen on a good note (no pun intended). <br /> <br />So there you have it! I still stand by what I said... There isn't one skippable song on this album, no matter how hard you look. Even the songs I rated three and a half stars are above average! This is truly an outstanding album, and I highly suggest you look into all of Evanescence's previous works (their EP's and such) if you enjoy this CD. You can't buy any of their EP's anymore (for reasonable prices, anyway), but you can download the songs all over the 'net (I seemd to have the most luck at mylastbreath.co.uk). The band has said that it's perfectly fine to do that, so feel no guilt! :P (Just make sure you buy THIS album, as it's still very available!) <br /> <br />If you've read this whole review, then I congratulate you! It took me longer to write this thing than I thought it would, haha! I hope I've helped you in some way. :) <br /> <br />Hey, just for the fun of it, here are some other bands you can check out if you like Evanescence: Within Temptation, Gretchen, Unfinished Thought, Switchblade Symphony, and Flyleaf. There are pleanty of others, you just have to look! ;)
B0001D0FTW|5.0|Indeed it's even better in some ways than their last album and I gave that five stars too. After Tears of a Mandrake I was almost nervous waiting for this disc to hit my stereo as how could they surpass the last one. Well they managed. There is more humour and more uncouth kicking butt here than many paint by numbers power metal tossers manage in an entire career.<br /><br />Just throw it on and listen as the first track roars out of the blocks. Track two had me worred - it's a damn long creation, but once you get over that your back into the swing.<br /><br />Tobias is in fine voice and the band seem so tightly meshed into some driving force. I actually caught them on this tour and the show just blended into one long celebration of metal. I couldn't of picked a highlight if I tried.<br /><br />And it doesn't slacken off toward the end, more cool tracks with a sense of fun - like the single Lavatory Love Machine. This is a band that doesn't mind making fun of itself though some might find the infamous German sense of humour a hurdle.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful album from a band that is thankfully somewhat removed from some of their power metal peers.
1400082773|5.0|As an author (\\"Suomalaiset: People of the Marsh\\" ISBN 0972005064) and lifelong participant in and follower of liberal politics, I found Senator Obama's story a facinating critique of race in America. Well written, terse, with the feel and breadth of a novel, the book is compelling and essential to anyone trying to comprehend what it means to be a minority in this great nation of ours. I can find nothing to criticize in the telling of this engaging tale except the publisher's insistence of including the text of Senator Obama's 2004 speech in support of John Kerry and John Edwards. Frankly, even though I am a liberal and didn't support the current guy in the oval office, I think including the speech demeans the spirit and integrity of one of the best memoirs I've read. Next time 'round, I'd urge the publisher to delete it and let Barack's story, as unfinished as it is, stand on its own merit.
B00097A5HW|4.0|This CD is great.  You will want to listen to it over and over again.  Shakira is great when she sings in English, but when she sings in Spanish...  Oh, it will make you melt.  Defintately not a one hit wonder, Shakira shows she has staying power as both an American and International Rock Star.  A must have.
0393312836|4.0|Although not the easiest book to read because of the author's diction, I found the novel well worth the effort. A Clockwork Orange is the story of a fictitious (but not all around improbable) society in which the protagonist, Alex, is a young heathen and criminal. He enjoys wretched activities such as vandalizing, stealing, and raping.  <br />   Life begins to turn sour for him when the police finally catch him. He is taken to a prison, and chosen to be an experimental guinea pig in a new brainwashing or \\"curing\\" process. Upon finally being considered \\"cured\\" some questions of the ethics of the process arise. Caught in the middle of a heated controversy, Alex, now the victim instead of the benefactor of this society, is left to fend for himself and try to live with his will virtually sucked out of his being. This is where the term \\"a clockwork orange\\" becomes relevant to his life. <br />    Overall, the theme the author conveys in this book is rather thought provoking, which I found to be the most enjoyable part of the book. I finished the relatively short novel feeling eager to ruminate on this question of morality. Is it right to making a being safer to society at the expense of his soul? It is a puzzling and unanswerable question that the author well represented in this novel of potential quandary.

B00005JL2O|3.0|When seeing the Austin Powers: Goldmember I thought it was an average comedy. Seriously they Mike Myers should have stopped at the second one. I didn't think that this was very necessary. The plot made no sense, (even though I thought it was kind of nice to go back into the 1970's). The new addition of the characters was pointless, and personally Beyonce should stick to singing, because she cannot act.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) meet in Tokyo, in a luxurious hotel. He is a has-been 70s actor, going on his fifties, and she is a young Yale university graduate in Philosophy. What do they have in common? It would seem everything would pull them apart. Yet, they find each other - because of their intense loneliness, and because of the soul-searching that invariably accompanies young and middle age.  <br />Bob isn't quite so sure whether his choice to become an actor was the good one; he's in his fifties, has been married for half his life;he is often traveling, away from his family. He is estranged from his wife, and the type of father that forgets his kids' birthday, yet still loves them deeply. Charlotte is a bright young graduate, and she has been married for two years only to a photographer (this is the reason why she is in Tokyo - she is accompanying him on the trip) who is not quite as bright as she is, and is also very busy, leaving her alone in her golden cage. She doesn't know what she wants to be in life, and probably questions her choice of mate as well. Neither of them speaks japanese, and they both suffer from insomnia. <br />This film, is certainly one of the best recent movies done. Admittedly, if your type of movie is action-oriented and fast-paced, it might be better if you saved yourself the trouble of watching Lost in Translation. Sofia Coppola's style is slow and methodical, yet deeply entrancing. The movie traps you, and puts you into the shoes of the protagonists (the gorgeous soundtrack helping immensely). You can feel the ennui like they do, and be sad as they are. <br />The story is one of affection - dare I say love? Between the two protagonists. Little is shown, but everything can be interpreted.  <br />Some of the scenes are poignant, and memorable.
0307276902|1.0|I read this book a couple of week before the Smoking Gun came out with their article and the truth about James Frey's many lies in order to make this book a best seller. <br /> <br />In looking back I should have been able to see for myself how ridiculous most of this book was. Originally the only real question I had was about James having to undergo all that painful dental work without any help from painkillers or anesthesia - that part seemed inhumane in the most extreme manner. <br /> <br />Now I believe the whole book is trash and I wish I had saved my receipt so I could return the book for a refund. I am sorry that this book, as well as My Friend Leonard continues to sell so well. It makes me sick that James Frey became a wealthy man based on lies, all the while pretending that the truth and only the truth was so important to him. He played me and every person who purchased this book for a fool. <br /> <br />I am very disappointed that both his publisher and Oprah have chosen to stand up for him. What a bad example for anyone to follow and I have lost great respect, especially for Oprah. <br /> <br />There is nothing to this story, if it is not based upon the truth. I would never have purchased this book if it had been listed as fiction. It is no wonder that so many publishers turned it down when it was presented to them as such. <br /> <br />James Frey is a liar and a fraud.
B000001EL7|4.0|Following the near perfect \\"Rock and Roll Over\\", Kiss decided to continue the momentum with another album in the same vein.  \\"Love Gun\\" features many superb songs from the band and is one of their best ever.    1. I Stole Your Love-5/5.  Excellent heavy rocker from Paul.  The music is killer, the lyrics are really cool and the vocals are among his very best.  A great way to open the album.  2. Christine Sixteen-5/5.  A truly raunchy song from Gene.  The music is excellent and proves that Kiss could use other instruments such as pianos and not totally destroy the song, as happened many times on \\"Destroyer.\\"  Great rocker with cool vocals.  3. Got Love For Sale-4/5.  Kiss try the acoustic backing the electric guitar thing again, but this time it works very well.  Really cool upbeat rocker from Gene.  4. Shock Me-5/5.  Ace's first vocal outing and it turns out great.  He has a very powerful voice and it suits his song well.  Very heavy song with Ace's best solo.  5. Tomorrow and Tonight-4/5.  Another great Paul rocker.  Very anthemic.  Lyrics and vocals are good.  6. Love Gun-5/5.  One of the all time Kiss Klassics.  Very cool opening riff, with the rest of the music being equally heavy and rockin'.  Very cool suggestive lyrics with some of Paul's best vocals.  7. Hooligan-4/5.  Another good song from Peter.  This one doesn't rock as hard as \\"Baby Driver\\" from the previous album, but it is still a good rocker with some cheesy lyrics.  8. Almost Human-4/5.  Cool, demonic sounding song from Gene.  This is similar to \\"God of Thunder.\\"  Very dark and heavy.  Great song.  9. Plaster Caster-4/5.  Very cool music and lyrics to this song.  I'm not gonna go into what the song is about, but trust me that it is quite raunchy.  It is an upbeat rocker from Gene that is highly overlooked.  10. Then She Kissed Me-2/5.  This was a very dumb idea.  Kiss doesn't do cover versions very well and this is no exception.  Very bad music and vocals from Paul.  A big mistake.    Overall, this is one of Kiss' best albums.  No fan should be without it and I would recommend it to any fan of 1970's rock.  It isn't quite as good as \\"Rock and Roll Over\\", but definetly better than \\"Destroyer\\".
B000002JNJ|4.0|because you will when you hear this album! Pantera started off as an 80s glam band but with the release of this album in July 1990, the band carved a new niche for themselves. this album isn't as heavy as their next few albums. it is more along the lines of 80s thrash metal. Phil does more falsetto screaming than growling and Dimebag Darell (R.I.P.) was just as amazing on the guitar back then. <br /> <br />the album kicks off with the classic title track. \\"Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell!\\" ha ha damn right! other faves are the catchy The Art of Shredding, the well-known Psycho Holiday, and Heresy, where Phil hits some HIGH notes. there are also some hints at now heavy Pantera would become on future albums on songs like Primal Concrete Sledge, Domination, and Shattered (man, Phil rips his voice to f*cking shreds on this song).  <br /> <br />i also love Cemetary Gates. very melodic and emotional. just check out how high Dime plays those notes at the end while Phil SCREAMS!!!! how anyone can sing that high is simply beyond me. <br /> <br />so there you have it. if you love thrash metal and you don't own this album then what the heck are you waiting for?!? buy this album NOW. and you will thank me later trust me.
B000001ELF|5.0|Ace Frehley managed to take everyone by surprise with his solo album.  I don't think anyone expected this to be as strong as it is.  The songs are much heavier than most Kiss songs were and was the biggest seller of the four, mainly due to the hit single \\"New York Groove.\\"  Not my personal favorite of the four solo albums, Ace's album is surprisingly consistent in a way he never would be again. <br /> <br />1. Rip It Out-5/5.  Super heavy opening track with excellent lyrics and Ace's best vocals.  The song grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go.  Excellent song. <br />2. Speedin' Back To My Baby-5/5.  Another heavy rocker with an upbeat blues riff to it.  The vocals, music and lyrics are all excellent. <br />3. Snow Blind-5/5.  This was the B-side to \\"New York Groove.\\"  This one is a bit slower than the first two, but is still very heavy and the lyrics are very autibiographical.  Excellent track. <br />4. Ozone-4/5.  This one is probably the weakest song on the album.  That doesn't mean its bad.  It's slow and sludgy with okay lyrics, but great vocals. <br />5. What's On Your Mind-5/5.  Another great rocker.  This song has an acoustic guitar backing the electric guitar and it works extremely well for the song.  One of my favorites on here.  The lyrics are about love without being cheesy.  <br />6. New York Groove-5/5.  This is a cover song.  I'm not sure who did it originally, but Ace's version is very good.  It isn't very heavy, but the beat is catchy and you will catch yourself singing it whether you want to or not. <br />7. I'm In Need Of Love-4/5.  Similar to \\"Ozone\\" in that it's slow and sludgy.  Not fantastic but not bad either.  Cool guitar effects and cool vocals. <br />8. Wiped Out-5/5.  Another autobiographical song.  Ace tells of his alcohol troubles, but doesn't get too serious about it.  Music is very playful until the chorus kicks in, and when that happens you will have your horns in the air and you will be banging your head.  Great song. <br />9. Fractured Mirror-4/5.  I'm not as big of a fan of this song as most people are, but it isn't bad.  It's a cool instrumental song for Ace to show off his excellent musicianship.  He plays everything but the drums on the entire album, proving just how talented he really is. <br /> <br />I don't think Ace's is the best of the four solo albums, but many people do.  It is without a doubt one of the most rockin' albums ever.  Highly recommended for everyone.
B0007XT87G|5.0|AMAZING. Best album of 2005, but even that doesn't do it justice. Best album of the millenium, so far. I hesitate to say best of all time, because of things like The Fragile and then all the Floyd and Beatles stuff that people could simply out-argue me about.  <br /> <br />DEADWING: Thrilling opener, never gets old, 10 minutes that feel like nothing. Unrelenting, very Tool-like in places, but also has moments of pure PT bliss. Actually, this song is worse than Blackest Eyes as an opener, but not far behind.  <br /> <br />SHALLOW: Steven Wilson describes this song as \\"a big dumb rock song, done in the way someone not dumb would do it\\". This song is awesome! Very straight ahead but intense and powerful, and no PT song could be complete without the major piano part contrasting with the heaviness. <br /> <br />LAZARUS: Well, this is the worst song on the album, sorry. People have said that this is better than Trains, and that is one of the most blatantly incorrect statements ever concocted, but oh well. Still a pretty nice song, nothing special, and not out of place.  <br /> <br />HALO: Perfect song. Kickass bass line, awesome drums, cool spoken word in the verse, catchy chorus, awesome jam in 17/8 in the middle, and back again. Cannot go wrong, and sounds terrific as the live finale. <br /> <br />ARRIVING SOMEWHERE BUT NOT HERE: Well, everyone's talking about it, and I can't really argue. It's magnificent. A 12 minute song has never ever felt shorter. This song does not get repetitive, it does not get old, it's totally cathartic, and seeing it live was one of the highlights of my life.  <br /> <br />MELLOTRON SCRATCH: Some people like this song more than others, and I personally feel like it's simply too long. But the harmonies at the end make it all worth it, and it's a good listen no matter what.  <br /> <br />OPEN CAR: This song grew on me the most. It has a very interesting riff that seems to not really make sense or click at first, but once you \\"know\\" the song, it's excellent. Also awesome chorus, and a brilliant, quiet ending.  <br /> <br />THE START OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL: This is my favorite song by Porcupine Tree. Completely haunting and genius. Awesome groove in the verse, a little action in 9/8, and a great catchy chorus that is so singable. My brother thinks that the piano section in the middle is a little bit cliche and overdone, but I don't, I think it fits terrifically and is not hackneyed at all. Such, such, such, SUCH a good song.  <br /> <br />GLASS ARM SHATTERING: It's chill, it's very Floydian (most Floydian they sound on this album), hard to argue with, and a great ending.  <br /> <br />SHESMOVEDON: Although this song is great in every way, I think that PT made a mistake by including this rerelease on the album, because it doesn't really sound any different than the one from Lightbulb Sun, but more importantly because So-Called Friend and Mother and Child Divided did not make the album, and these songs are both so awesome that Wilson should have included at least one of them on the A-side.  <br /> <br />Here is the thing about Deadwing, compared with In Absentia: I think that Deadwing is a better album, but barely. The first 6 songs of In Absentia set the pace for the best album of all time, but the last six simply do not hold up, so InAbs is flawed and therefore worse than Deadwing, even though very little on Deadwing matches InAbs's beginning. Both are incredible albums and should be bought, bathed, fed, and treated like royalty. Either that, or Steve Wilson should.
0316857750|3.0|This book is about a boy (Kiyosaki) and his friend Mike who learn about money making and financial decisions for the future from men (their fathers) that have experienced the highs and lows of business decisions.  The two boys learn the different ways that different people (\\"Rich Dads\\" and \\"Poor Dads\\") make and use their money.  One of the fathers is a very well educated professor and the other is a dropout.  Conversely, the dropout ends up becoming a very rich man that teaches the characters about money making and keeping money.  This book is basically a \\"How To\\" guide to dealing and valuing money.   <br />  <br />The message that Kiyosaki wants to convey gradually reveals to the reader that one has to make their money work the way he or she wants it to.  Kiyosaki does a good job about guiding the reader in to show how it is possible to make one's money \\"work,\\" however, there seems to be no sturdy actions that one can take to accomplish certain financial goals.  The book does give several examples that justify the general idea, but it seems like it would be hard for one to apply bring about their own needs given the limited \\"real-world\\" guidelines.  In conclusion, Kiyosaki gives beneficial advice to those who are struggling with maintaining financial stability.    <br />
B00070Q8DQ|2.0|This is my first Behemoth CD and I almost find it laughable when others desribe this as \\"epic.\\"  Nile does epic, this is just crap that goes nowhere.  Boring guitar riffs with random note solos just slapped over top, this reeks of untalented to me.  The drumming is just OK (look ma I can do blast beats, woohoo!), who knows what he could do with good music, maybe something.  The vocals are the worst, he has got some wierd effect on his voice most of the time and is the most monotone, nasal vocalist in my entire CD collection.  Whoever told that mouth-breather he could sing in a band was sadly mistaken.  Aside from all that the songwriting is subpar and forgetable.  In my quest to find good metal I bouth this album based on the hype and reviews on amazon, don't make the same mistake I did.
B00005JNJV|5.0|My husband and I recently watched Batman Begins (purchased the dvd based upon these Amazon reviews) and we were pleasantly surpised by this movie.  I am not a Batman fan, of either the comic strip, TV show or previous movie versions, but I thoroughly enjoyed this adaption.  All of the actors did an excellent job, especially Gary Oldham - is there no charcter he cannot portray?  I was expecting not to like Katie Holmes, but again, was pleasantly surpised by her performance. She was too young to play the part of an assistant DA, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. And her character does an excellent job of reminding \\"Batman\\" of his roots and of his parents and what they represented.  The movie did not drag and I look forward to more adaptions featuring this winning combination of director, actors, writing, etc.
B00003CXFV|2.0|Even though I would agree that \\"Erin Brockovich\\" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in \\"Pretty Woman.\\"  I am second to no one in enjoying a good \\"David and Goliath\\" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the \\"true\\" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the \\"Xena\\" character is the main attraction in \\"Xena: Warrior Princess\\" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character). <br /> <br />Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in \\"Pretty Woman\\" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs. <br /> <br />Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired \\"work clothes\\" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests. <br /> <br />Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The \\"convenience\\" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar \\"bonus\\" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a \\"thanks\\" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.  <br /> <br />The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly. <br />
B0000636UN|4.0|Sheryl Crow in her previous albums had moved in an acoustic and almost Dylan type mode. <br />This CD she is moving into more of a commercial Rock mode. <br />Steve McQueen is a Rocker that is high energy and gets you in a Rock mood. <br />Soak up the Sun to date is in my opinion her most commercial effort ever. I almost get the feeling it is something Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys would write. <br />She does a duet with Stevie Nicks that is the title song for the CD entitled, C'mon, C'mon. <br />Abilene is a nice ballad, and shows her country side. Weather Channel is another song of note. <br />This is a departure from her previous albums and is her most commercial. There are some good songs and it is worth the listen
0425152251|4.0|As a philosophy major now in college, i can say that this book is what introduced me to the world of and progression of philosophy.     <br /> <br />That being said, it is truly a great way to learn ONLY THE BASICS about philosophy (in a pretty entertaining way).  The mystery side to the novel, helps make this intro to philosophy a little more enjoyable to read.  I personally think that this book should be required for all young high school students. <br /> <br />I only gave this book four stars because if you are looking for a good mystery, keep looking.  This is a long book with the actual plot/mystery definitely taking a back seat to the education of young Sophie in Philosophy.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a good reference book in philosophy, this is not that either.  For that purpose it is far too brief.
068987474X|4.0|My therapist begged me to put this book down...however....the very day after- confirmation!  I'm \\"sort of seeing someone else\\".

No way.  <br />If they're \\"just not into you\\" move on, they are missing out for sure.
B000002KLP|5.0|Prince's first two albums are good, but they don't exactly sound like the Prince that we all know. There's something kind of generic about them. With his third album, Dirty Mind, Prince finds his sound and ability to shock. <br /> <br />The album is legendary for its shocking songs about oral sex & incest, but the most shocking thing is how the music must have sounded at the time. A blend of rock & funk Dirty Mind was the most exciting of each of those types of music. <br /> <br />Dirty Mind is actually the demo tapes of the album. Prince was told by Warner Brothers that they should release them as is. This gave the album a raw sound that Prince himself has never matched.  He effortlessly plays every instrument, drums, bass, keyboards & vocals like a tight band.  <br /> <br />It's a no nonsense collection of fast, fun, and danceable music that presents Prince for the first time as most of us would always picture him. Many Prince fans await his return to this style of music.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|\\"Collateral\\" is a fashionable example of just how exuberant a thriller can be. A film such as this is an endurance test for the director, since it is composed of gritty, dark material that makes the film itself more challenging to tame. The film's sturdy foundation is constructed primarily of the performances of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, who, when they are both at the top of their games, seem to dominate the other major and minor characters that arrive on screen. I am sure that the movie would have been as enticing if it were just the two of them in the story and no one else.     As the first frames elapse we realize that we could very well be watching two totally different movies. It is mid-afternoon in Los Angeles, and a mellowed-out cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) is shuttling his fares around the city. One of which is Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), a beautiful attorney who is trying to get back to her firm and do some last minute prep work for a big case that she has the following day. Annie suggests a route to her firm, but Max offers a quicker one. He tells her that if his way is, in fact, slower, she will not have to pay the fare.     This opens up for a long conversation in which two people at different spots on the social ladder engage in some intriguing, flirting-free dialogue. Screenwriter Stuart Beattie uses this scene to set up two important characters who inevitably play crucial roles in the story, and not a single word exchanged between the two gives the film a negative effect. Max ends up winning his bet with Annie, but he insists that the ride be free of charge. When Annie walks away, we can tell by the look on Max's face that he wanted desperately to get her number. Then Annie unexpectedly returns to the cab, taps on the window, and hands him her card.     As she walks away, Max sighs in relief as he realizes his night is made. But as he pulls away from the curb, another fare slips into his cab. The man's name is Vincent (Tom Cruise). He needs a driver to stay with him during the night and take him to five separate locations around Los Angeles, and he offers Max a handful of one hundred dollar bills to do the job. Vincent is a polite, charming, and conversational individual. He has a big night ahead of him - and so does Max.     What unfolds for the remaining 100 minutes is a long conversation between hit man and mild-mannered cab driver. \\"Collateral\\" is all about dialogue and set pieces, with a story managing to fit perfectly into a script. The two leads exchange late night chit-chat, personal beliefs, and, when a body falls from a window thanks to the violent will of Vincent, some more aggressive words. Max finds himself fending for his life, as Vincent abruptly morphs into a malevolent customer.     The mere fact that Vincent is a killer does not make him the bad guy in the film. True he is bad, but \\"Collateral\\" somehow does not establish the \\"hero and villain formula.\\" In fact, it is not even focused on establishing it. The conflict is that of a struggle between two men with two totally different agendas, and the battleground is composed of psychological and verbal warfare. We watch and hope that the struggle will escalate into a physical battle as we realize that this is a situation that Max can not escape just by using words and mind games. He will have to get out of it by using his head and, if needs be, his more aggressive side. The question is, will he? That is a question that you must find the answer to. \\"Collateral\\" is such an intelligent film that seems so complex, but is instead so simple.     There is one scene where Vincent and Max go into a jazz nightclub and talk with the owner, who has a long history of performing in music. It is incredible how situations so simple can grasp your attention just by the words that are exchanged by the characters involved. Most movies are stories jammed with dialogue, but \\"Collateral\\" is dialogue jammed with a story.     Not to say that the film is flawless. Asthe movie lags on, the body count rises, and if you have seen last years \\"A Man Apart\\", you probably know how careless this can get.  \\"Collateral\\" s final twenty minutes should be its most enticing, and while they are, they are also the sloppiest. I would have loved to have seen the film end in something besides a chase that rampages through a massive building and concludes on a subway, but Michael Mann's direction and Stuart Beattie's screenplay thoughtfully turn it into an intriguing cat-and-mouse game. You can't help but lean forward in your seat during the prolonged climax, but when all is said and done, you will most likely hope for some sort of alternate ending on the film`s DVD extras.     If nothing else, \\"Collateral\\" is purely electrifying when it wants to be, and even when it isn't it is still an enjoyable watch. What we have here is a thriller that focuses on its two main characters, gives them a certain period of time to battle it out, and entertains the audience in the process. While there is not enough potential for an Oscar as far as best film goes, this is still a great movie, but screenwriter Stuart Beattie should be given an award for his trouble.    Rated R; 120 minutes; Directed by Michael Mann
B00005JOQ9|4.0|What else would one want in their horror movies. This one had the graphic violence and gore. It also had Cinemax late-night soft-core porn for most of the first half. Ain't nothing wrong with that.
B00005R8FI|5.0|I first heard \\"Room to Move\\" many years ago on a rock and roll retrospective radio show and thought it to be a neat little curiousity at the time. I was more familiar with his electric work with the Bluesbreakers and when I heard it again thought I'd seek out the album, discovering it by accident in my local library (Hartford, CT branch, excellent CD selection!). I was putting together a collection of unplugged CD's for my car and knew \\"Room to Move\\" would be included. I didn't count on every song being worthy of inclusion! The Turning Point has such a nice flowing groove to it, it's not quite blues, not quite rock, not quite jazz, just very good timeless acoustic music. The 3 songs added for the reissue only add to the groove Mayall establishes from the suitably low-key intro he gives his band members and they kick right into the groove on the first song \\"The Laws Must Change\\". A highly recommended treasure from Bill Graham's much-missed Fillmore East. Wish I could've been there! <br /> <br />Thank you Bill Graham wherever you are!
B00005JO04|3.0|In \\"Syriana,\\" director/screenwriter Stephen Gaghan returns to the same formula that he used in his screenplay for Steven Soderbergh's \\"Traffic\\": he tells four separate but interrelated tales of suspense and skulduggery, all revolving around the same multinational theme. In \\"Traffic,\\" it was the drug trade; in \\"Syriana,\\" it's the oil trade. The stories in \\"Syriana\\" involve Bob (George Clooney), a longtime CIA agent operating in the Middle East; Bryan (Matt Damon), an oil-industry analyst backing a Persian Gulf prince (Alexander Siddig) for succession to the emirate; Barrett (Jeffrey Wright), a young attorney who discovers that his firm is involved in some very shady oil deals; and Wasir (Nazhar Munir), a Muslim radical in the making. The film looks good, the dialogue is excellent, and all the performances are effective. (Besides the aforementioned actors, there are fine performances by Chris Cooper as an oil industry hotshot and Christopher Plummer as a reptilian Washington power broker.) Yet the film, though watchable, never really takes off. Gaghan lacks Soderbergh's ability to tie all the stories together effectively, and in places--particularly those scenes involving Barrett's investigation of his own firm and his meetings with the Feds--the film slows down to a crawl. The other three stories are all worthy of a full-length movie on their own; as it is. Gaghan leaves us wanting more, and not in a good way. We never have quite enough information on these characters, or quite enough invested in their ultimate fates. At least one reviewer has accused Gaghan of completely subverting the non-fiction book on the oil trade on which he supposedly based his story. I've never read that book, but I can say that Gaghan's movie, though well-made, never really engaged me.
B00000HZFH|5.0|Simply put, Keep it Like a Secret is the culmination of the greatest three album run in indie rock history.   <br /> <br />My story with this album is something like MWM's just below.  It's a little embarassing but it must be told.  I bought this album when it came out in '99.  Somehow, I didn't get it.  Somehow, I stopped listening to it almost immediately.  And somehow, I eventually sold it back.  It wasn't until 5 years later that I got back into BTS via There's Nothing Wrong With Love.  I quickly got every BTS recording including obscure stuff like the BTS/Caustic Resin EP.  Having seen them in NYC last year, I feel comfortable now calling them my favorite band.   <br /> <br />I too regret my lost time with this band, but my failure to connect immediately with them is not a random thing.  This stuff comes at your ear from a different direction than you may be used to and it MUST be listened to several times before you start to get it. You hear the word \\"angular\\" used a lot to describe BTS and whatever that means it seems to convey this facet of their music.  Great music is often uncomfortable to hear the first time and BTS was because it truly is something different, an advance in the history of rock music. <br /> <br />Humorously enough, my brother, who has similar musical taste to me is caught where I was 5 years back.  He owns this one and never spins it.  I burned him There's Nothing Wrong With Love and Perfect From Now On and he shrugged them off after one listen.  Dude, if you're reading this, get into this band already. <br /> <br />For those new to BTS, this is a great place to start.  There are definitely moments on their previous two albums that I would consider my favorites (Car, Big Dipper, I Would Hurt a Fly), but this is probably their most consistent and accessible album overall. <br /> <br />This band tends to be compared to Sonic Youth, Modest Mouse and Pavement, but if you're like me, you find those bands either too avant garde, too angry or too arch (respectively) to truly love them and setlle for liking them instead.  While similar, Built to Spill are humble and earnest enough to connect with emotionally and they are adventurous and experimental without resorting to pointless noise.  Get this, then go to town on their whole catalog, then wait breathlessly for \\"You in Reverse\\" in April. <br />
B000005IS1|5.0|Throughout rock history, there have been a number of bands, particularly from the Midwest, vying to be known as *the* all American, working class \\"people's band.\\" This is a trend which, I would say, probably accelerated with Grand Funk, continued through the 70s with groups like the Michael Stanley Band, as well as Bob Seger (whose Get out of Denver is a classic, and whose Night Moves remains for me a personal favorite of its era), and others, and then picked up steam in the 80s with John Mellencamp (an aside - there is a contemporary punk band, I don't know what they sound like, but they call themselves John Cougar Concentration Camp, which I find amusing, albeit in a non-PC way), and probably dozens of others. Most recently, we've had Kid Rock.<br /><br />However, I've always thought the true representatives of the repressed condition of the heartland working class were more the rebels and miscreants like the MC5 and the Stooges, (or in England, Black Sabbath from the industrial city of Birmingham would have been more or less the equivalent) and then later on, bands like the Dead Boys and even Pere Ubu , or today, the novelty-rap act Insane Clown Posse. No disrespect intended to the working class, or for that matter, the Midwest; I come from working class roots myself, and spent three enjoyable years of my life in the Midwest.<br /><br />Listening to this blend of garage band power chords, proto heavy metal and protest rock, what you hear, beyond a somewhat murky sound, is the blood, sweat and tears of a fine group of rebel rockers. These guys deserve to be thought of as a seminal precursor to punk, particularly the more politically driven punk of bands like the Clash, Dead Kennedys and Millions of Dead Cops. Here, then, is a chance to hear what the MC5 sounded like live. It may have been the 60s, but mellow is not a word to describe them.
B000001GOZ|4.0|First, let me note that I am very picky about the Mahler 6 and have not heard any recording that deserves a five-star mark.<br /><br />That said, that means Boulez's recording is among the top. I like Boulez's clean instrumental separation; some consider it antiseptic or stringent, but I prefer to think of it as deromanticized.<br /><br />And, by the time he gets to the Sixth in the Mahler cycle, Boulez had developed his Mahlerian chops on nuances of tempo, shadings of volume, and all the other filigrees that distinguish good Mahler from bad. (Do be careful with some of Boulez's early Mahler recordings, though.)<br /><br />But, as with other reviewers, I must note the lack of fire, especially in the first movement. (That said, I'm not sure I've heard ANYBODY play the opening theme crisply enough... not just tempo, but overall crispness.)<br /><br />For people looking for a good more \\"traditional\\" interpretation, I suggest the first Bernstein recording, among others.
B000031XCR|2.0|I really wish I could have rated this higher. But the simple truth is that as a greatest hits album, this was lacking.  <br /> <br />My main reasons for buying this album were \\"The Power of Love,\\" and \\"It's All Coming Back to me.\\" I already own the previous albums that these songs came from, but I thought it would be nice to own them on a single cd. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the songs on this cd were shortened versions.  <br /> <br />If you're just a passing listener who only wants an overall showcase of Dion's carreer, than this cd is fine. It collects a fairly good sampling of her stuff. It has the glaring absentee of \\"All By Myself.\\" Come on! This sucker was played to death on the radio. I think it deserves a spot on a hits album.   <br /> <br />If, however, you really love the music and respect it, you don't want shortened versions of the songs. When you know a song and know it well, like the back of your hand, it can be jarring and disheartening to hear it chopped up and edited like this.  <br /> <br />This is not a slam against Celine. She's a great singer and I've always at the least respected her, if not loved her music. I just can't rate this album high after what it did to my favorite songs. <br />
B000001GRE|5.0|As one other reviewer noted, the Seventh is probably Mahler's most \\"analytical\\" symphony. So, Boulez's \\"deromanticed\\" interpretation of Mahler logically works best here. Plus, as I note on my review of the Sixth, the later Boulez gets into the Mahler cycle, the more nuances of good Mahler conducting he gains.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|This album is starting to settle in with me after the fourth or fifth listen.  When i heard that the strokes were going to shake things up on their new album i became excited with it, Ive always liked the band but felt they could use some more variance in the song writing.  Then after hearing the corny juicebox bassline and reading luke warm reviews i started to become cynical towards the release.  I bought it expecting to be underwealmed, but after listening to it a few times i decided it's about as good as anything theyve done.  One complaint is the length.  In their first two releases the albums were tight and to the point.  This album has alot more fat.  I find mself getting bored with the album somewhere around track eight.  They shouldve cut a few songs namely fear of sleep and red light and maybe a few others. <br /> <br />If you enjoy their first two albums and want more Strokes then by all means pick this up.  If your looking to get into the strokes then I wouldnt start here.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Probably the selection of songs could have been better, but what a performance and what a production. It is a treat to see Jordan Rudess (keyboards) and John Petrucci (guitar) taking the main solo lines supported by John Myung (bass) and Mike Portnoy (drums). Jim Labrie, on the other hand and in spite of the years, is still reaching the highest notes and delivering a powerful performance. You should not miss the opportunity of adding this high quality production to your DVD rock collection.
B00008WG3U|1.0|I have always and still consider my self a big NOFX fan, But this album sucks in my opinion.  It just doesnt sound like NOFX.  NOFX has always done a great job at making catchy ass songs with out falling into the same old pop punk trap that alot of their epitaph brethren have fallen into.  Im afraid thats not the case with this one.  There are a one or two good songs but when compared to Liberal Animation, S&M Airlines, Heavy Petting Zoo, White Trash, etc...  it's a big let down.  I first thought maybe it just had to grow on me like Pump up the Valium or So Long had to, but it never did. Its just not a good album.  I hope their next one is better but Im enclined to think this one is the begining of the end.  If your new to NOFX and looking to hear their best stuff try one of the earlier mentioned albums and pass on this one.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|It's a good record.  Mayer obviously has a tight band and good guitar chops, though his singing still doesn't do it for me.    But even if he's transitioned into guitar god mode, he's not one yet.    [...]  Sure, he has great chops, and he knows his history (at least some of it).  But having legions of fans or 14 Dumble amplifiers does not a great guitarist make.    I listened to \\"I Got A Woman\\" and kept wishing for something to kick in.  I'm not sure what.  Something to push the solo over the top.  Listen to Stevie Ray - he'd get to a point where the music would jump into some other dimension.  Listen to Wes Montgomery - he would keep the listener on the edge of the seat for a good twenty choruses, with each one building on the one before it.  Listen to John Mayer, and while it's good playing, that \\"it\\" factor is missing.  He doesn't have that deliberateness in his playing.  Listen to Wes hit a note and you know damn well that he wanted that note there, in that exact place, for a reason.  Or Bird, or Charlie Christian, or B.B. King, or Hendrix, or Santana.  Listen to John Mayer and that presence isn't there.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|I was living in Los Angeles and I remember the HUGE billboards going up all over town prior to the movie's release.  Even before it was released, everyone was panning the film.  Too many people listen to critics...  I look at it this way:  If someone is a movie critic, they are an actor, director, screenwriter, etc. who has failed.  Ditto for music critics - they wanted to be composers, musicians, recording artists, and failed.  I went to see this movie and laughed till I couldn't breathe.  I picked it up on VHS years ago and will purchase it on DVD as well.  It was a modern take on the various 'screwball comedies' of the 50's and 60's.  The characters are hysterical even if they [and some of the script] is a tad predictable.  There are inconsistencies in the film, such as the story taking place in New York, but when they go to a hospital, it is the hospital in Woodland Hills, CA.  [they COULD have put up a fake sign while filming], and other 'mistakes' that a trained eye can catch during the film.  But overall, Griffin Dunne and Madonna work well together and there are so many quotable lines in the movie that after all these years - I remember and still laugh at.<br /><br />Highly recommended for an irreverent, laugh-filled viewing.

B00003CXWV|4.0|This is my first time buying an \\"Infini-film\\" product and was discusted. The DVD skipped durring every chapter transition. I duno if anybody else had this problem but Blow only comes produced by this company so I guess I'll deal with it. I have a brand new DVD player that plays all other DVDs perfectly, except this one. On another note, the movie is great, Liota, Depp and Cruz at thier best. I give it a 4 because it is a high quality film but on a low quality DVD.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|The script was clumsy, and the special effects were unprofessional.  The letters and signs were in English, even though the action takes place in Germany.

0307276902|1.0|I read most of this book and was skeptical even before the hoopla broke out.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|The Concert at Royal Albert Hall is a remarkable document, as well as a flat-out thrill for long-time Cream fans.  I can recall ruefully seeing a clip of Jack Bruce sometime in the `80's declaring that he didn't think there would ever be a Cream reunion-\\"Some things are not for sale,\\" were the words I believe he used.  The famed feud between he and drummer Ginger Baker was to deny the world for another 20-odd years the sublime delight that has now culminated in this DVD.  If you have the notion that I might be exaggerating the greatness of this recording, then you either do not appreciate the blues-rock genre, or you have simply not seen the concert.   <br /> <br />Right from the opening, Spoonful serves up a Cream concert standard that rivets the beholder, and the ensuing tour de force keeps the intensity unabated through the encore of Sunshine of Your Love, some two hours and another disc later.  Eric Clapton, on the included interview session admits that the re-formed band had to go into training not only musically, but physically to be able to produce the shows it did.  This definitive power trio positively amazes the viewer with its continually fresh improvisations and energy, despite the 60 year ages of its members.  There are no side men, there are no synthesizers, tape loops, and in fact no famous wah-wah pedal in White Room.  But that track, and so many others, will blow you away.  In his interview, the ever brash Peter Edward \\"Ginger\\" Baker asserts defiantly \\"I think we sound better than ever.\\"  And he is right. <br /> <br />I got out some of my vinyl and listened to it critically, and I am here to tell you that Messrs. Bruce, Baker and Clapton have grown tremendously in musical ability and style in the 36 year hiatus of Cream.  And it is not simply the quality of the recordings.  Each musician is a virtuoso, not just compared to their contemporaries in 1967.  Ginger Baker admits his grudging admiration for the skills of his band mates, \\"I don't think there are three musicians with a better sense of time than three of us.\\"  They play, they go into individual improvs, but they come back on a beat like they were never apart.  You can catch glimpses of their individual joy as each segue begins.  <br /> <br />Here in the US, there has been little attention paid to either Baker or Bruce since, let's say the early `70's, while Eric Clapton has been a regular in the music scene all along.  Accordingly, one might have expected that he would dominate the concert, and you will see the young folks in the audience anticipating this.  But part of the magic of this reunion is that Eric is the superstar gone home to his family, where he is given no special deference, and his \\"family\\" brooks no conceits from him.  Each one feels and plays as an equal and that is really what made Cream the stuff of legends.  Even rock and roll's other great power trio, ZZ-top, has never achieved this kind of parity among members. <br /> <br />My personal favorite is White Room, and when you watch it, you will really see the power of Ginger Baker.  The whole thing is done with drums, bass and single guitar, and despite the never-to-be-forgotten licks of the original, along with the numerous overdubs necessary to yield the grand introduction of this rock classic, 2005's version is simply outstanding.  Far better than the awful \\"WAHHH, WAHHH, WAHHH, WAHHH\\" vocalized by the band on the Live Cream, Vol. 2 recording.  Similarly, Deserted Cities of the Heart, done originally in the studio with a lot of overdubs and phase-shifting, has been simplified, but plays well.  I was disappointed to have Those Were the Days left off the play list, and there are some others that the band should try, like I Feel Free, SWLABR, and Tales of Brave Ulysses.  But you won't be dissatisfied, I promise you.   <br /> <br />The individuals have certainly aged, but Eric Clapton, who is the youngest, I believe, looks well, Ginger Baker looks the oldest, but he is, and he hasn't let health scares keep him away from his cigarettes, still looking like he could handle himself in a tussle outside a club. He kicks it for ten driving minutes on Toad, never boring the audience with die-outs or re-grouping of himself. In his own interview, Jack Bruce alludes to health issues he has had, but he doesn't slack off a bit in the show, despite occasionally resorting to a drafting chair for support.  He belts out the majority of the vocals like he has a rented set of pipes, careless of how he might return them.  He characteristically messes up the lyrics here and there, but that, like Clapton's sweat-soaked blouses and Baker's numerous broken sticks are testimony to the authenticity of the performance.   <br /> <br />So, if you wonder what to watch on a cold winter night, hook your stereo up to your DVD player, cue up Cream at Royal Albert Hall and prepare for a real treat.  As Ginger Baker says, \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog have reopened their shop.  I think they are selling T-shirts.\\" You will want \\"more Cream, please.\\" <br />
044651652X|4.0|I usually don't like romance novels because of their predictabilty but Waller's Bridges of Madison County breaks through the genre with emotional characters and thought provoking morality questions.     The Bridges of Madison County leaves you questioning your ideals as you attempt to justify or condemn the affairs of the two main characters.  Honestly the writing is average but the setting and the purity of the character's emotions make this story work. <br /> <br />Clearly the most interesting aspect of this book is the polarity in peoples reactions to it.  It's a deeply personal tale and those that can relate to it probably are the ones that can appreciate it.  Does it glorify adultry?  Perhaps, but the stars were alligned in this affair which makes it easier to accept and enjoy from a readers standpoint.  Which ever side of the fence you fall on will also probably determine if you like this book or not.  I say probably because personally I disagreed with what the characters were doing but the beauty of the whole literary experience made the book enjoyable.  I guess in the end I rationalized that this was fiction and that I didn't have to take a stance. <br /> <br />I haven't seen the movie nor do I have any desire to since Maryl Streep and Eastwood are way too old to be these characters in my mind. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  An interesting look on the dichotomy between the simplicity and complexity of a marital affair.  What some find beautifull and pure, others will find abhorent and ugly.. <br />Bottom Line

0805028846|1.0|There are dozens and dozens of pictures showing what you could make with paper, pencil, and exacto knife, but the instructions were minimal and only for the simple projects. Beautiful examples are shown throughout the book, but no instructions on how to make them. Having patterns for the more intricate projects would definitely help out. It's an okay book to learn the basic, but lacking for advanced designs.<br /><br />The Title \\"Step by Step Instructions\\" is very misleading.
B000286RNY|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this film is a delightful masterpiece.  It's full of silly comedy, but it also has a very nice story about a team of losers seeking to become something more.  Yes, that's nearly every sports movie that's ever been made, but what seperates Shaolin Soccer is its visual flair. <br /> <br />The movie takes those old Wu Shu cliches and puts them on the soccer field.  More importantly, it does so without insulting the kung fu genre.  This is a silly movie, but it's also full of geniune characters and enjoyable action.  Never has soccer been more ridiculous or awe-inspiring. <br /> <br />I hate to compare movies, but I'd have to say that though this film and Kung Fu Hustle share a lot in common, they are also very different.  Shaolin Soccer is more realistic, set mostly in the real world, with super martial arts as its only strong fantasty element.  It's a quieter film, but by no means did I find it boring.  It's still a unique and entertaining film, full of nonsense, grace, and heart.  And that's not something you get to see everyday. <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|I have listened to Paul McCartney's music from his early days with the Beatles through his Wings era and his on again, off again solo efforts.  There have been moments of absolute brilliance and moments where I wondered why.  In recent years there have been serious lows in the quality of Paul's music.  I was apprehensive in buying this music.  Was this going to be another \\"Pipes of Peace\\" or was it going to be \\"Band on the Run.\\"  Of course, it is neither, but it is very good.<br /><br />I was impressed at the outset with \\"Fine Line.\\"  I am partial to this song because it sounds so much like McCartney from the Beatles era.  I know that Thomas Wolfe said you can't go home again, but this song certainly feels like home.  The song is surprisingly bouncy and buoyant.  The lyrics may be less than inspired, but with a sound and style like this, and the instrumental excellence, who cares?  Interestingly, Paul plays most of the instruments on the songs in this CD, and he does very well.<br /><br />The second song, \\"How Kind of You,\\" is much less inspired lyrically than the opening track, but the music is still good.  I consider this song one of the weakest on this CD, and yet it is still listenable.<br /><br />Next is a song that is so heartbreakingly reminiscent of the Paul of old that it is almost hard to listen to.  \\"Jenny Wren\\" bears some stylistic similarity to \\"Blackbird,\\" though the lyrics and topic are completely different.  This song is one of the best on this CD and this song shows that the creative spark that has always been Paul's hallmark remains.<br /><br />\\"At the Mercy\\" is a slow song with guitar highlights that make this song interesting.  I am unenthused about the opening and the refrain, but that guitar is so good that it saves this song.<br /><br />Flipping back to a faster beat is \\"Friends to Go.\\"  Again Paul returns to a style reminiscent of days gone by, and creates yet another comfortable song that is enjoyable to hear.  Paul follows that with another stylistically classic song, \\"English Tea.\\"  At an AM short 2:12, this clever little song is a lovely addition to this CD.<br /><br />With \\"Too Much Rain\\" McCartney moves into more serious and complex material.  The music is fresh and optimistic and is one of the best songs on this CD.  The music is appropriately dramatic in places, and yet is never so deep as to be bombastic and is never so shallow as to be throwaway pop.  Current pop artists have a lot to learn from this music.<br /><br />To keep the music interesting, McCartney tries another style.  \\"A Certain Softness\\" is light and lovely, with interesting lyrics.  The piano work and speed of this song are perfect for slow dances, candlelight and romantic evenings.  Sir Paul still has it!<br /><br />I find the mixed reviews of \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" interesting.  This slow song is introspective, as exemplified best by the lyrics and the pace of the music.  However, the vocals keep the song from falling into a malaise.  I like this song, though it features some of Paul's weaker vocals on this CD.  While the song is introspective, it is actually about the self-absorption of a significant other.  The melancholy tone is because the singer sees no way through his significant other's vanity to reach her heart.  A poignant song about a love that is forever doomed.<br /><br />After the complexity of the previous song, perhaps it was fitting to have a simple song to follow.  \\"Follow Me\\" is simple lyrically and musically.  The music is more upbeat than the previous song, and with its faster pace it provides a nice contrast with the previous song.<br /><br />Paul returns to Beatles days with \\"Promise to You Girl.\\"  The harmonies and pace are both haunting memories.  Even the lyrics are reminiscent of those days.  This fine song is a fitting addition to the catalog of this former Beatle.<br /><br />I like the delicate song \\"This Never Happened Before.\\"  Romantic songs should sound like this.  The words are simple and the music is easy on the ears.  The pace is quiet with subdued guitars.  This elegant little love song may break little in the way of new ground, but when they are this easy to listen to, who cares?<br /><br />This CD closes with the very long song \\"Anyway.\\"  This song sounds much like McCartney of the 70s.  The music is old and new, bright and blue, and written for me and you.  There is a brief pause in the middle of the song and a transition to an instrumental that is markedly different from the opening song.  The instrumental has elements that encompass Paul's career from the Beatles to today.  We can only hope that this song does not represent a coda on Paul's career.<br /><br />Paul McCartney has found himself once again on this solid album.  His vocals are often amazing; the music is refreshing with a very good mixture of classic and new elements.  It would be easy to look back over a career that is into its fifth decade and become maudlin, but Paul refuses to allow age to change his musical outlook.  Paul will always be a Beatle, and part of Wings, and above all, he will be himself.  This album proves it.  Please Paul, give us more like this.s are simple and the music is easy on the ears.

0679720200|4.0|The other reviewers who mentioned that this book is dreary reading with an unlikeable, inwardly dead protagonist have hit the nail on the head.  Though the book is short enough to be fairly easily read in one sitting, I found it impossible to identify with the soulless protagonist, and the dreary story seems to last much longer than it does.  It wasn't until I started to write this review that I began to understand what I believe the book's lasting appeal to be. <br /> <br />That appeal, I believe, lies soley in the main character.  Camus does an amazing job of putting his reader inside the head of the ultimate amoral, cold-blooded sociopath and passes no obvious judgements on his lack of emotion or values.  Camus takes many of the abstract quandries of an existentialist, absurdist view of life and gives them flesh and speech.  In doing so, he (perhaps inadvertantly) points out all the unsavory problems with this philosophy, which go far beyond the mere rejection of traditional morality and values and extend into the rejection of what we think of as humanity itself. <br /> <br />It's an interesting, enduring book for that reason.  Hell of a dreary read, though.  If you examine the ideas behind this book, you'll definitely think.  Just don't expect to feel anything, except perhaps disgust.

B000BYA5GO|3.0|Obviously intended to be a dark satirical look at the amazing world of gunrunning, Andrew Niccol's LORD OF WAR offers the average viewer an inside look at not only how and who sells guns and weapons, but why.  Nicolas Cage stars as Yuri Orkov, a Romanian immigrant who works his way to the top of the gunrunning trade, taking on a fashion model wife (well played by<br /><br />Bridget Moynahan), his cocaine-addicted brother (a convincing Jared Leto) and a competitor (Ian Holm, cagey as always).  Cage's character is really an antihero but with his sharp wit and self assuredness, a likeable one.  Ethan Hawke has a supporting role as Jack Valentine, a federal agent who dogs Cage but can never come up with enough evidence to put him away.  The movie's ending is chilling in its implications.<br /><br />While not a movie to really admire for its thematic content, LORD OF WAR is very well done and Cage is extremely good in this difficult role.
B000065PUE|5.0|Loud, usually angry voices, awesome background vocals, great lyrics and distorted odd guitar leads make this album what it is. Although it's more \\"accessible\\" than Surfer Rosa, it still took me 3 or 4 listen to get into it. This album is one of the most important albums  for the Pixies, so before you call yourself a fan, you must get this, then Surfer Rosa. Get this album as soon as you can.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|From New York comes yet a great and honorable band that has made it this far. From previous albums \\"Is This It\\" their debut album which had hype all over the press and know we know why has been a great success for them. And in 2003 they yet released another follow up album from their debut which is \\"Room On Fire\\". <br />Which people thought was a copy of \\"Is This It\\". Songs that just repeated themselves over. Now in 2006 we get their best album up to date which is \\"Fist Impressions Of Earth\\". In this album we see The Strokes full potential on what they can do. With Julian Casablanca's very tone dramatic voice,Fab Morreti's power drumming which he truly shows off in \\"Heart In A Cage\\", Nick Valensi power dronning guitar, Albert's very thrash banging sound, and Nicolai Faiture who really kicks up the album a notch with his booming and throbbing bass riffs.The Strokes truly show themselves off in this one especially in \\"You Only Live Once\\" which is a very good change for them.\\"Juicebox\\" with a bassey and thrash guitaring tune.\\"Heart In A Cage\\" which is a very fast paced. With Julian Casablanca's very catchey songwriting and with nick,albert,fab,and nickolai teaming up to help him this alnum is an instant classic in my books, and the best strokes record yet.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is full of sadness, and emotion, but it doesn't bore you . I still can't believe one of the reviews, which said, <br /> <br />\\"...none of these songs have ever been on MTV, TRL, BET or the radio, that tells you right their that Radiohead is a joke band with no talent!! If you want good musik with good guitar playa's who know whats up, then by any album from Hawthorne Heights, My Chemical Romance, Green Day, Taking Back Sunday, Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects, Papa Roach, Atreyu, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Kid Rock, Disturbed, Death Cab For Cutie, Reliant K, Good Charlotte and the always brutal KoRn\\" <br /> <br />Wow, this is what the music industry has created huh?  <br /> <br />Anyways, this album is essential for any Radiohead fan.I recommend this Radiohead album after the Bends, because the Bends would 'ease you into Ok Computer. It might take a few listens, but you won't be disappointed at all.  <br /> <br />My Favorites - Lucky, Exit Music (For a Film), Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Karma Police, No Surprises. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are also excellent, but those are just my favorites. So get this album after the Bends, but it is an essential CD for any music fan.
B000AGTPUA|1.0|This movie was written for young children with very little to stimulate adults.  Most good Christmas movies connect with all age groups.  This movie was boring, predictable, and really did not say anything healthy or meaningful to children as far as I am concerned.  I agree with the reviewer who is concerned about this movie's theme of \\"believing without doubt or questioning.\\" That message is a very dangerous one considering the world we live in.       My wife and I were looking at our watches a great deal, even though we like Christmas movies.  I guess it might have been visually exciting if I could have seen it in 3-D.
B000068IEU|1.0|I really thought this movie was going to be great. I watched it, and I was very dissapointed. The main menu of the DVD is better than the whole movie. I thought the story line was horrible, the acting was worse. The score was absolutely terrible. There were scenes in the movie where the girl was running from the killer, and it was some upbeat banjo song. How bad is that. I want to give this movie a zero star rating as well. I really wish I could take it back and get my money back, but I can't. I wouldnt even pick it up at a garage sale for a quarter. This movie is horrible. Dont waste your time, or money.
B00005JNZJ|2.0|The cynic in me is beginning to wonder if there is a shortage of filmworthy material out there, as again another borrowed medium makes its transition to the screen. Now, this is no crime, when one looks at the success of the Spiderman, X-Men, and more recently Fantastic Four movies, and other pictures that have developed even video games into movies, with moderate success. But most of those had a wider recongition base, and global audience to work from leaving this feeling very \\"special interest\\". So I understand it, Aeon Flux is a relatively successful animated pulp magazine/storybook, and previous short TV series on Liquid TV that has been around for some time, and has a reasonable following amongst the adolescent community. The picture however, starts from the false assumption that you are familiar with the storyline, characters, and chronology of the aforementioned books. As faithful and appealing as that may be to hard core fans, it does tend to leave the uninitiated viewer out in the cold, so to speak. I spent the first 30 minutes or so wondering what the hell was going on, and although I picked up the idea (and a nice SciFi idea it is) the script and action had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Often movies like this, bypass the theater and head straight to their intended target audience in the DVD section, and gambling on a major release with the injection of big name actors, is a very hit or miss affair (anyone remember Spawn?)<br /><br />Theron is certainly visually distracting in a seemingly endless wardrobe of leather and spandex, and the rest of the cast DO follow through their dialogue with conviction, but it simply isn't enough. The end result comes out like a ruined surprise souffl&eacute;, with plenty of promise, but flat as a pancake. Considering the short 93 min running time, some back story would have been more than feasible, and would have helped the movie immensely; also a little more concise editing would have been a welcome addition to the often choppy direction you see on screen. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but it's really not very good either, and sadly the inventive story and initial ideas ended up being way too large for its own production leaving a watery popcorn flick for the MTV generation. Wait for the DVD!hoppy direction you see on screen.

0142004235|5.0|This book has everything that a good read should possess.  It's dramatic, ironic, entertaining, holds meaning, makes one feel and is beautifully written.
B0000AOV85|5.0|This is the best documentary I have seen about any rock album. There is great editing, weaving the music in and out of the documentary. There is great interviews with all the band members, (although Nick Mason does not get much air time, Why?). There are also clips of the band members doing acoustic versions of several of the songs, Absolutely incredible!!!!!!!!!  A Must have for any Pink Floyd Fan.
0307276902|1.0|I just want to say that this book was an utter waste of my time. I didn't even finish it...If it's not getting interesting by page 200 then \\"chuck it\\".  I'm a voyeur, who isn't?  I love a good biography.<br /><br />However, I think I can honestly say that this is one idiot that I don't have any interest in knowing about.  Screw Oprah's Book Club.<br /><br />I understand the whole addict thing...my family and friends to name a few...But, come on. Get a clue dude and stop screwing around in rehab when \\"it's your only chance left\\" Boo-Hoo James Frey....This is one book that we could all burn and it would be okay...
0060512806|2.0|I'm still trying to convince myself that going from his superb portrait of Nell in The Diamond Age to the rather weak characterizations of Amy and Glory in this book didn't bias the underlying humanist/feminist nature of my critical faculties unduly against this whole enterprise. And while I found his inability to write an ending only mildly exasperating with TDA, it was wholly unacceptable to me in this book. Because? It felt like nothing had happened. I know a lot of stuff happened around the characters, but Bobby and Randy and Amy didn't seem to grow from it. This is the one book of Stephenson's that I've read so far (up next, the Baroque cycle) where he's allowed the technology to overwhelm the characterization. It was disappointing, as he's always been excellent at balancing the two before.
0451169514|3.0|'It' had the potential to be Stephen King's greatest novel, surpassing 'The Stand', if not in length, then at least in the size of its emotional wallop.   Unfortunately, King strayed from the focus of the story, and crammed too much improbability into the last hundred or so pages.  All of the ingredients for greatness are there: immensely likeable characters(one of King's many strengths is his ability to 'write kids') pitted against Pennywise,  a personification of evil in its darkest, most depraved form.  It's too bad King ruined the spirit of several characters in the story's climax. Coupled with the underwhelming true nature of the threat of 'It', as well as the ridiculously melodramatic disaster that befalls the town of Derry, the story suffers from a lack of focus, with too much going on in too many places.  Despite its flaws, 'It' is still a remarkable piece of work. Fortunately, many of the flaws of the ending can be overlooked so that readers can form their own, more satisfying version.  The 1990 TV movie thankfully rewrote the worst aspects of the story. Read the book to get to know the characters, but see the movie for a somewhat more satisfactory wrap-up.
0553801503|2.0|The first three were as spectacular as this one is a flop. Most chapters, with a good editor on them, would have been deleted. I wish the crows could pick this dead corpse apart and leave the slate clean for us... since it can't I still have hope Martin will actually listen to the critics and make a save with the next book... which likely I'll wait for in paperback! Save your money on this one, skip it if you can, you'll miss a lot of Cercei paranoid and power hungry delusion and an idiot journey of Brienne of Tarth. A few chapters are worth printing... the ones on Arya. That's it!
0689859368|5.0|After much protest, my son broke down and read the first book of this series, The Field Guide. I had already read it and knew that he was in for a real treat. For the very first time, my reticent reader ASKED for me to buy him a book (Book 2) with the same enthusiasm usually reserved for Yu-Gi-Oh cards or Bionicles. What's even more amazing, he sat down immediately to write his book report... on his own! <br /> <br />This is a great book and a fast read. I already shelled at the $9.95 for Book 1 but it will be donated to the classroom library. Can't wait for the boxed set to arrive!
B0006J28KU|4.0|This is an all-time classic in the book of film noir and gangster films. However, as complex as the 3hr. plus picture is, it is undeniably out of balance. The thief being as methodical as he is and as careful (enough to pull \\"this shot or that shot\\") as he is, should get away with it in the story line. The casting of two titans of Hollywood Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, goes without saying is superb. All other secondary roles and story lines are all contributing to the same balance this picture lacks with its main characters. If this is not the battle between good and evil, what is it about then?. If this is not a story about confrontation by the powers that be vs. the currents that want to take some of it. What is it about?. In other words, if you fail to see that there is a lack of balance and try to put it on the photography, the other actors, the story line as a whole, you probably need to have your senses checked. And did I mention that you don't need to live in L.A. to understand this?
0790729342|5.0|The Road Warrior AKA Mad Max II. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have articulated the fine features of this film. Allow me to throw a few of my own unique ones into the pot. <br /> <br />Collapse of Western Civilization: I don't think its been done better. The screenwriters set it up with excellent reality making it entirely credible. <br /> <br />Use of visuals: One of the beautiful aspects of the film is that it uses visuals and music instead of dialogue to tell the story in many scenes. That results in 100% brillance. So often today films have to overkill the dialogue. This is done with taste and quality. Its a lesson to modern filmakers. <br /> <br />Tension: The music score is perfect augmenting the feeling in the scene that accompanies it. The editing is also flawless. <br /> <br />Story: As a person who understands human nature the story is entirely believable. Western civilization falls, all hell breaks loose it becomes kill or be killed leading to anarchy. Thus, the \\"sane\\" world becomes rapidly devoured up by chaos. <br /> <br />Acting: No weak performances. All the characters flesh out wonderfully. <br /> <br />Many would consider this not a \\"chick\\" flick. (I can't believe I typed that cliche) It is a deeply intense drama that brutally represents of what the world would be like if anarchy ruled. It might turn off some for that dark protrayal. For me personally, I view this as a post apocalypse \\"Gladiator.\\" Gladiator had many of the excellent film and story traits this film has. <br /> <br />Simply put - Probably the best example of the post apocalypse genre in terms of story, film making and editing. If you don't have it you are missing an excellent piece.
B000BKJ78K|5.0|Guys and gals, QUIT THE WHINING !!! This is NOT a money making scam. If you read the info on the DVD release (on amazon, for example) it will tell you that this is a cheaper version of last year's release for those who want to spend less. It also FOREWARNS you that there is no bonus disc. It burns me up that people gripe and whine when they don't even know the facts.  <br /> <br />As for the special editions, They are Lucas' movies and HE CAN DO WHATEVER THE HECK HE WANTS TO WITH THEM AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T BUY IT !!! I myself happen to like the special editions and could care less if I ever see the dated, 70's-80's versions again. As a matter of fact, I would love to see all the movies with updated effects, etc and even more alterations and editions. It Lucas' vision, he put up his cash to make them, and he doesn't have to give a hoot what you think about his vision of the movie. The funny part is that you will gripe, but you just keep on buying behind the scenes. Get a life people. Enjoy the movies in whatever format you have them and leave Lucas alone. Geez
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've never writen a review on Amazon.com, but any fan should take the time to try and spread the good word on this show. <br /> <br />I don't watch much TV and I have to admit that I paid no attention to Firefly when it was on Fox.  I can't even remember seeing ads for it.  It was just recently (after hearing all the glowing reviews for the Serenity movie) that I stumbled onto the Firefly DVD set.  I decided to give the show a look before I watched the movie.  It took me a couple of episodes to get my head around the style (kind of a sci-fi/western vibe), but once I did I have to say that the DVDs were worth every penny.  A very original and entertaining show! <br /> <br />Don't let the fact that it's a sci-fi show turn you away.  My wife (who usually can't stand sci-fi) even got hooked on it! <br /> <br />I'm guilty of passing the show by when it was originally on the air, but I have to say it's a shame it was cut short so soon.  I only hope that this series will someday be resurrected.  The characters, stories, and style were so original that it just doesn't seem fair that the book was closed on them.  Maybe if the fans (old and new) keep spreading the word the series will have a chance to live on.  Judging by Amazon's sales rankings of the film and the tv show it could become a possibility. <br /> <br />Five very well earned stars!!
B00005JOIF|4.0|MUNICH<br /><br />During the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, eleven Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered by a Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September. In retaliation, the Israeli government recruits a group of Mossad agents to track down and execute those responsible for the attack.<br /><br />  Anytime I hear that Steven Spielberg is directing a film I immediately take notice and become interested. I am a big fan of true events being brought to the screen and this film certainly did not disappoint. I had always known of the massacre that occurred in Munich during the 1972 Olympic games but never knew in great detail what actually occurred. So I went into this film expecting a great film and at the same time hoping to be educated in this horrific event.<br /><br />  Eric Bana plays Avner the leader of the group of agents that are attempting to bring justice to what occurred at the Olympic games. I had never been a huge fan of Eric Bana, he was commendable in the film Troy but Hulk was a miserable film to say the least. However I do not necessarily blame him for Hulk, I tend to start disliking the people that are associated with crap films. Regardless, Bana redeemed himself in Munich.<br /><br />  This film does not pull any punches, it is a very gritty and emotional look into what took place and it does an excellent job of immersing the audience into a world of revenge and loyalty to ones country. At times this film will have you on the edge your seat as you watch the agents set up and pull off assassinations then immediately throw you into a emotional roller coaster as you watch the mass murders ensue and the paranoia that plaques the agents as they try to fulfill their duty to their homeland. Real footage of the Munich tragedy is at times seamlessly blended into the movie and the cinematography is stunning to say the least. One worthy mention is Ayelet Zorer who plays Daphna the wife of Bana, she does not have a huge part in the movie but she excels in her role and I hope to see more of her in the future. Munich definitely has the Spielberg touch and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />  Rating: 4/5excels in her role and I hope to see more of her in the future. Munich definitely has the Spielberg touch and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />  Rating: 4/5
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite Prince albums of all time, and im one that ranks N.E.W.S, Come, 1999, and The Love Symbol Album in my favorites with it. Sure there's the whole spiritual and political idea behind this album, but that only gave him focus, and no matter what your beliefs may be, you cant deny the unbelievable music coming through your speakers. This is one of those albums that can get you dancing and moving around your room with tunes like 1+1+1 Is 3, Family Name, Everywhere, and The Everlasting Now, and yet it still has the ability to make you wanna make some sweet love to whoever your lover(s) may be with tracks like Muse 2 The Pharoah, Digital Garden, The Sensual Everafter, and Mellow. This is one of the most well put together albums he's ever done, the spacing of each style of sound really flows like a story, and if your IQ isnt below 80 you should be able to follow it. Pick this up, it will expand your mind.
B000BP86OG|2.0|THE DARKNESS<br /><br />One Way Ticket To Hell..and Back<br /><br />This review is going to be short and sweet...<br /><br />The Darkness is merely one step ahead of Tenacious D as far as taking themselves seriously. I just cannot take them seriously, they are very talented musicians do not get me wrong and I have found myself many times cranking up the volume on some of Justin Hawkins stellar gutair solos. But overall this is not a band who I ever travel 16 hours to see as I did for U2.<br /><br /> Looking at this CD, without remembering the brilliance of the first album ( Permission to Land) makes this a decent album, however, it is definitely nothing to write home about. Their sound has been slowed down alot and in my opinion having only 10 tracks is unnacepptable. To be honest nothing particulary sticks out from this album for me other than the song Bald. They try their best to imitate Queen on the final track Blind Man  but it falls up short. Overall this album does not deliver and fails to exceed their debut album.

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was one of the few books that made me cry while reading it. The words are so touching that I couldn't keep back the tears. Albom's writing was just so fluid that I swam through the pages with such comforting ease, finishing the book in a few days. It's books like Tuesdays with Morrie that I truly appreciate. Not only do you enjoy a heart-felt story, but you are able to reflect upon life and think about what really matters in the end. Of all the books I've read, Tuesdays with Morrie is by far the best.
0684833395|5.0|And now to explain Catch-22 in a single word \\"circular\\".  Heller managed to create a variaty of characters and then milk them for all they've got.  For those of you who expect an anti-war book, go read something else.  If, however, you enjoy quality literature and can stand the unexpected, Catch-22 is addicting. <br />Note: This book is very confusing, and to those who can't make sense of it, it will be really bad.  I read it for an english class, but if I tried reading it for pleasure, this reviewed would be titled \\"ADD Overload\\"
B000063DFN|1.0|First off, I'm a huge fan of heavy medal and punk and all kinds of hardkore rock, my friends know me as that crazy guy that likes all that head-banging musik!!  I was rekommended this album cuz all my friends know of my love for hardkore musik, so I was prepared to be blown away, but when I played this album, I had to wonder what the heck this band was smoking when they recorded this album!!  The worst part is the singer, its not medal the way he sings, he's trying to be an opera singer, the lyrics are weird, and there's no rap or hip-hop parts in his vocal delivery!!  The guitar players are all over the place, its pretty confusing!!  The bass player is turned up wayyy too much in the mix and the drumber might as well not even show up!!  There are better bands, I say buy anything from harder edged bands like KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Hawthorne Heights, Taking Back Sunday, Green Day, Good Charlotte, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Kid Rock, Papa Roach, Atreyu, Slipknot, Death Cab For Cutie, All american Rejects and intelligent hip-hop artists like Kanye West, 50 cent, nelly, Jay-Z, Juvenile and Chingy!!  Leave this Iron Maiden band to rot in the cut-out bin at your used rekord store, hahha!!  Go Bengals!!  Who-Dey!!!
0783231202|5.0|We as black Americans have been denied our history too long. Steven Spielburg makes a movie about how white people mistreated our black ancestors and the movie critics down his movie. This is blatant racism. If you can praise him for Schindlers list then why can not you like this movie? This film was an eye opener to all of the black men and women who have been enslaved by the white mans misrule. Why praise him for a movie about an ET or the holocaust and then ignore him when he tells the story about slavery. I say again it is racism. You all should be ashamed! <br /> <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I rarely buy DVDs without having first seen the film, but based on reviews posted here and over on Netflix, the very favorable comparisons made to Colin Firth's Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and Richard Armitage's John Thornton in \\"North and South\\", I rushed out and bought this sight unseen. I didn't really expect it to live up to all the rave reviews, but I'm delighted to say it exceeded them, and oh, what a romantic ending -- compares favorably the ending in the Kiera Knightley/Matthew Macfayden movie, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" although it takes place beginning on a railway platform and ending inside a train carriage.<br /><br />I certainly can see why many compare \\"North and South\\" with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" although most refer to the 1995 BBC production. But I would include the 2005 film in my comparison (and I love both versions) because, for example, I really noticed the close-ups on the touching of Thornton's and Margaret's hands, especially at the dinner party (I half expected Thornton to flex his hand as Macfayden's Darcy did; he doesn't) and later Margaret kissing his hand -- both these events compare very favorably with Matthew Macfayden's Darcy's reaction to holding Lizzy's hand to help her in a carriage and the ending when she kisses his hand. And Thornton's more casual look in the final sequences without his coat and cravat -- which gives him a romantic Lord Byron look in his big sleeved white shirt with wide cuffs which come to his knuckles -- rivals the casual look Darcy presented when he comes to Lizzy at dawn at the end of the film. These men go from being buttoned up and formal to more casual romantic suitors. It's very pleasing. I think most women will swoon at the kisses -- the best I've seen in a very long time -- as I did and it is true the 5+ minute ending is one of the most romantic and satisfying ever filmed. I've rewatched it many times.<br /><br />Although the excellent story (wonderfully acted throughout by a talented cast) is grim at times (people do die in this), and it is certainly not the lighthearted fare of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as it deals with the Industrial Revolution -- the horrifying working conditions in the cotton mills, strikers versus their employers -- I think the story is more real and easier to relate to than \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" And, interestingly enough, it is a story which would more easily be updated to a present day story in some ways (look at United Airlines, General Motors and others which are struggling with worker's vs. management, layoffs and averting financial ruin). I found it is easier to relate to businessman/entrepreneur John Thornton struggling to run his cotton mill, a huge manufacturing complex, as he deals with restless workers and the market forces of the cotton industry (the pre-Civil War Americans -- this story is set around 1850 -- are flooding the English markets with cheap cotton products and English manufacturers like Thornton are having a hard time competing) than to landed gentry and matchmaking of Jane Austen's books. This business aspect, as well as certain parts of the love story, are almost contemporary.<br /><br />The love/hate, pride/prejudice behavior between Thornton and Margaret definitely rivals in many ways the Elizabeth/Darcy relationship right down to her rejection of his offer of marriage, their verbal barbs, his walking from her home after his rejected proposal (shades of Colin Firth's Darcy leaving Mr. Collin's house after Lizzy rejected him). Above all, Richard Armitage (a very handsome actor) as Thornton definitely does smoulder as much as Colin Firth's Darcy did -- maybe more so. I hope to see a lot more of him because it's not just looks here, but he's a very fine and talented actor.<br /><br />All the actors in this production are terrific. This is a wonderful BBC production I can highly recommend and again, the last 5 minutes are among the most romantic ever filmed!(people do die in this), and it is certainly not the lighthearted fare of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as it deals with the Industrial Revolution -- the horrifying working conditions in the cotton mills, strikers versus their employers -- I think the story is more real and easier to relate to than \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" And, interestingly enough, it is a story which would more easily be updated to a present day story in some ways (look at United Airlines, General Motors and others which are struggling with worker's vs. management, layoffs and averting financial ruin).

0060278234|4.0|\\"Lirael\\" picks up some fourteen years after \\"Sabriel\\" ended. Sabriel and Touchstone may have defeated the Dead and saved the kingdom once, but it was only a stopgap measure. There are other, far worse things out there that want control of the Kingdom, magic, and all the lives they can take. Sabriel and Touchstone (now Queen and King of the Kingdom) do what they can to stem the tide of destruction, but this time it's up to the next generation to take the fight to the Dead things.    Sam, the son of Sabriel and Touchstone and a prince of the realm, is the Abhorsen-in-waiting and Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, those who can See into the future. The problem is, Sam is terrified of Death and has no desire to be the Abhorsen, and Lirael doesn't have the Sight. Neither is lacking in courage, though, no matter what they might think of themselves when despair comes over them.    In order to rescue a friend from his school days in Ancelstierre, Sam sneaks away from the palace and the overwhelming weight of responsibility to become the next Abhorsen. But things are far from being as simple as he thought. Traveling alone with no practical experience at doing for himself, he quickly finds himself in over his head.    Lirael becomes an assistant librarian in order to keep her mind off of her lack of Sight, and in time she begins her own study of Charter magic, finding her way into places no lowly assistant is meant to go. She grows in power as a Charter mage -- with the help of Dog, whom she \\"creates\\" (much more complicated than that) -- and eventually comes into a destiny she neither sought nor really wants.    Two young people who both have hard lessons in life to learn, and truths neither of them want to accept. They both cling to a vision of what they, or others, want their lives to be, and letting go of that may be the hardest thing they've yet to do, even after going up against necromancers and the Dead.    There is no nice wrapped up ending in this book; it will (hopefully) be concluded in the third one, but this one doesn't suffer from being only one half of a whole. The writing is engaging, even with the switching points of view, and although Sam spends too much time in whining and self-pity, he and the other characters are likeable and well fleshed out. The big revelation at the end of the book is pretty obvious, from the first time we meet Lirael, actually, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the story. This is definitely a good follow up to the first book.

B000AP04FG|4.0|Mr. and Mrs. Smith was quite a surprise.  The opening scene of the film bears similarities of an obvious plotline.  Little do we know that Brad Pitt (John Smith) and Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) live a double life in their quaint suburban splendor-- two car garage and neighborhood parties  Behind the white picket fence, lives the gun toting couple who live on espionage and intrigue, and lies.<br /><br />The film is a cross between a James Bond film and an episode from Alias.  With its fast-paced action and semi-dark comedy tone, the film offers the crash and boom along with the laughs.  The laughable dialogue and movie soundtrack includes the eclectic sounds from Joe Strummer, which gives some of the scenes where Jolie and Pitt \\"duke it out\\" a quasi spaghetti western feel.<br /><br />Jolie and Pitt may not be in the same league as past Hollywood couples.  However, they attempt at providing sophistication and humor to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which makes it a \\"good-looking\\" film with all its high gadgetry and high jinx.  It is one of those films to see for the fun of it.
0440241588|4.0|Being my first Grisham novel ever, I found that The Broker is a quite lightweight on law and attorney issues, which are not my favorite book subjects.  Grisham's depiction on the main protagonist's runaway plot in Italy is quite convincing.  Though mostly fictitious, he depicted streets, daily lives, eateries, etc. in an interesting way.    CIA, Mossad, Chinese intelligence, Russian intelligence and the FBI all want to get their hands on this broker.  While the action part make up about a third or less of the plot, the remaining parts are mostly basic daily life topics.  These topics include romance.    I really enjoyed this novel and may consider other Grisham's novel, as long as they are not too heavy on law and attorney issues.  Comparable reads: Dan Brown's Decption Point and Elizabeth Peters' The Golden One.    Though superbly written, the author falters near the very end of his novel.  Why?  On the very last chapter of this novel, one issue has not been resolved by Grisham and left unfinished.  That is, the Chinese had sent their best undercover agents to \\"fix\\" the protagonist and even have arrived in the vicinity of the protagonist locations, but they never took any actions at all.  These supposedly highly-trained and high-IQ operatives had never even been in contact with Backman senior, the protagonist.    Another predictable plot is when the Mossad is hesitant in finishing up Backman senior, though they could have done it halfway through the book.  At the end the Israeli government pulled the plug for this operation, which is also predictable.    What could have been a five-star novel, is now reduced to four-stars.  Nevertheless, The Broker is a recommended light read.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is one of the best albums I bought last year. Its got great songs and great music. Rarely can I listen to an album all the way through and actually enjoy EVERY song. I recommend it to anyone. I've also seen them live and they were great. They put so much energy into their live shows and they really interact with the crowd a lot. They are just a lot of fun. There is a reason so many people say they are an amazing band to see live and there is a reason they are selling out all over the world. They're just that darn good.
B00067BBQE|5.0|Very good, I couldn't have been more pleased, the only complaint, which many people agree with this, is the rapid editing, but that wasn't really as bad as people make it out to be (unless your picky about these things) anyway, this DVD was great (I loved the hour of behind the scences they showed! It was hilarous!)
B000BVEKO0|5.0|Alright, reading some of these whiny one star reviews makes me want to take a hammer to my skull while watching old \\"Wings\\" re-runs. Once again i read paragraph after paragraph sayng how korn has changed and why dont they go back to their roots blah blah blah,yet these same people hated Take a look in the mirror which was closest to their self titled debut, or their roots  Even still these same people , and there seem to be many of them, say Korn has not done anything good since follow the leader.Truth be told follow the leader was Korns worst effort to date. Yet sadly its all many \\"fans\\" hold on to nowadays. Every Korn album has been ingenious and creative in its own way with exception being as i stated, follow the leader, which was more like a rap album and had that god awful Fred Douche, err i mean Durst. Now as far as this new effort, Coming undone and the bonus track Eaten up inside, which belonged on the main album, are the 2 standouts on SYOTOS. Liar is another cool track. Only songs i truly could not stomach to listen to more than once or twice were politics and tearjerker. This album is a must have if your really into Korn and the raw emotion and thought they put into their trend setting music.There is the noticeable absence of \\"Head\\" which ,while unfortunate he is gone, doesnt detract from SYOTOS in any way and hopefully Korn keeps pumping out album after album. God bless Korn
0060899190|5.0|It was the dust jacket that grabbed my attention. I bought this book last night off a whim. I brought it home around 11:30pm and didn't go to bed until 5:40am due to what I found inside. You open this book to find the confessions of families, friends, neighbors, individuals who you would probably never expect to have the secrets they do. These are the secrets of everyday people. I found a lot of these personal anecdotes common to my own thoughts...I just have never had the balls to tell someone. A great conversation piece...intriguing, amusing, disturbing, inspiring! <br /> <br />\\"There are two kinds of secrets: those we keep from others and those we hide from ourselves.\\" - Frank Warren
B000301YY8|1.0|This album may have some good lyrics and melodies in places (like some other reviewers stated), but the apparent flagship of this album \\"Beautiful\\" (judging from chart position) isn't any praise worthy at all. A lyrical example:\\"I saw your face in a crowded place, and i don't know what to do\\". Sounds like something anyone could have written anytime. The melody in this song is extremely weak, repetitious and tiring in combination with James' voice that most of all sounds like a goat (which usually aren't associated with great singers).    If you can't sing, why not let someone else sing your songs?    I know I might be at risk of being shot by ex-soldier Blunt, but it's a risk I have to take. This kind of garbage can't go by without a comment...
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I'm a big fan of the original movie.  When I heard this re-make was being done, I was hopeful and curious and waited in anticipation to see what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp would come up with.  I watched the original movie on DVD with my kids and we watched the documentaries and such.  I then decided to get the book and read it to my kids before the movie came out. <br /> <br />Doing both of these things really made me appreciate this movie more than the original.  Don't get me wrong.  The original is a classic and will always be a favorite of mine, but this movie is so much closer to the book and brings the sights, sounds and smells of the book into a more vivid light than the original movie could for it's time. <br /> <br />When you watch this movie, you must remember that when comparing the two, you're looking at two very different movies made in different eras with different amounts of technology available to them.  If you're a huge fan of the book, you may have loved the original film because it was a marvelous adaptation for it's time, but it's very flawed and strays somewhat from the book in several areas (there is no bribe from \\"Sluggworth\\", Charlie doesn't steal Fizzy Lifting Drinks, there is no Wonka-mobile or Wonka-Wash,  the Oopma Loompas look more like midget clowns and - let's face it - the Great Glass Elevator wasn't made of much glass at all).  The new film, however, sticks very closely to the book with the exception of Willy Wonka's childhood sequences and the slightly altered ending.  But these additions simply work and work well. <br /> <br />The movie starts out a little slow, but so does the book, telling about Charlie, his family, his love for chocolate and the grandparents (all of them talk in this movie, not just Grandpa Joe) telling marvelous stories about Wonka's early years.  Then the fun begins with the introduction of the contest, the children and Wonka himself.  I know that some people will find it old and clich, but I think the \\"It's aSmall World\\" spoof right before the children enter the factory is hysterical. <br /> <br />Like many others are saying the Oompa Looma's are THE highlight of this movie.  This version sticks right to the book in terms of their origin and appearance.  Like I said, in the original movie they are a little freaky looking - like demented little clowns - who sang cutesy songs.  I was wondering if Tim Burton would do something with the songs - either rehash the ones from the old movie or do something entirely different.  He completely surprised me by having Danny Elfman take the original words from the book and put them to music.  I have to say that these songs are truly inspired, very good and should be nominated for an Oscar.  Sadly, by the way the Golden Globes turned out, these songs will be sadly overlooked. <br /> <br />Freddy Highmore and the rest of the children are great actors and filled their roles well.  I really didn't care that they weren't very much like the ones in the old film because this is a different time and children have different interests.  For example, the best way to portray Mike Teavee in this day and age is to have him be a too-grown-up-for-his-age (and his own good) videogame junkie instead of a gun-loving, western film watching TV junkie. <br /> <br />The aspect of Charlie's home life is a real treat, something that seemed a little forced in the original movie.  We get interaction with all of his grandparents and he has both parents.  You can see and feel the love they have for one another despite their poverty.  Of course, we also get the typical Tim Burton architecture (incredibly slanted walls, gaping holes in the roof and a chimney that looks like it's about to fall over) for their little shack.  I even found myself liking Grandpa George more than Grandpa Joe in some parts!  But David Kelley, as Grandpa Joe, was a joy to watch and brought a little more joy and wonder to the role than Jack Albertson did. <br /> <br />Ah, and then there'sJohnny Depp as Willy Wonka.  What can I say?  Weird?  Freaky?  Demented?  Absolutely!  I read an interview where he said he was a big fan of the original film but didn't want to be influenced by (or more importantly, compared to) Gene Wilder's performance.  He simply had to take the character in another direction while keeping him as true to the book as possible.  I think he accomplished this very well and the sequences of his childhood show us why he may lack some social graces (leaving home at a young age) and be out of touch with reality (building his own reality inside the factory).  I even understand that when going through the script, Depp had his copy of the book and requested changes to be made that came directly from the original source. <br /> <br />For those who loved the original movie, you may or may not like this movie, depending on how open-minded you are in terms of artistic license and acceptability that this is a NEW film based on the book - not a reworking of the first movie.  For those who love the book on it's own, I think you'll be very pleasantly surprised.  This is a wonderful adaptation done with flair and love - and much more faithful to the source material.  I must admit that the only thing I missed in this movie in comparison to the old movie was the part in the boat when Wonka hauntingly sings, \\"There's no earthly way of knowing / Which direction we are going / There's no knowing where we're rowing / Or which way the river's flowing / Is it raining? / Is it snowing? / Is a hurricane a-blowing? / Not a speck of light is showing / So the danger must be growing / Are the fires of hell a-glowing? / Is the grisly reaper mowing? / Yes, the danger must be growing / 'Cause the rowers keep on rowing / And they're certainly not showing / Any signs that they are slowing!\\"  A classic part.  But this movie is still great nonetheless. <br />
038073186X|5.0|I bought this book strictly on the recommendations found here on Amazon. I finished it at 4 AM today. I could not put it down. As I was getting close to the ending I had to keep going back and reread to see if what I was seeing was really correct and if so, how did I miss it? After I finished it, I went back over the prolog and the ending and then laid it gently on my nightstand. I couldn't sleep, wondering how someone can write a book like this and admiring Dennis Lehane for the incredible twists and turns and eventual blockbuster ending.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal, is sent to a mental institution to find a dangerous female inmate who has somehow escaped. He has another mission, to find the man who killed his wife. He was surprised and annoyed to find that he has a partner, Chuck Aules, another U.S. Marshal. Teddy is aloof at first but then finds that he really likes Chuck. A hurricane is coming, and they will be stuck on the island. It appears that all kinds of things are going on here, some criminal experiments on patients, evil doctors, dark secrets. The deeper Teddy and Chuck get into the goings-on the more the reader gets drawn into the mysteries.<br /><br />That's as far as I'll go. To reveal the ending would be a crime! This book is very disturbing. You will probably think about it for a long time, I know I will!<br /><br />I immediately came to Amazon to pick up some of his other books. I don't think he could top this one but I intend to find out!
B00005B4GU|3.0|When \\"Amnesiac\\" was released, critics referred to it as \\"Kid B,\\" because it was obviously related to Radiohead's prior album.  The most blatant similiarity is the fact that \\"Morning Bell,\\" a below-average Radiohead song at best, appears on both(although I like the version on \\"Kid A\\" more).  I know it's practically blasphemous to criticize anything Radiohead, but I think it's safe to say that \\"Amnesiac\\" is their weakest album, excluding \\"Pablo Honey,\\" which I can't comment on, because I'm not familiar with it.    Not that it's all bad.  Quite the contrary, in fact.  As with the band's other albums, one must use headphones to appreciate this album -- Radiohead uses stereophonic sound to their advantage about as well as anyone this side of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  I love the song \\"Knives Out,\\" with its subtle acoustic intrumentation and unnerving vocals. Other highlights include \\"Pyramid Song,\\" \\"You and Whose Army,\\" and the hypnotic \\"I might be Wrong.\\"  I have trouble deciding whether \\"Dollars & Cents\\" is brilliant, boring, pretentious or all three.  The remainder of the songs though, to me are unmemorable.  The Stone Roses did backwards better (\\"Like Spinning Plates\\"), and I can't really accept Radiohead as a Klezmer band (\\"Life in a GlassHouse\\").  \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,\\" sounds interesting, again, with head phones, and only after the first few listenings.    Anyway, Radiohead's next album, \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" was better, and got them back on track as one of the greatest bands of the last 20 years.
B000092ZYX|5.0|CAREFULL!!!  Listening to this album may change the way you listen to music for good.  This is a great experience, you should definitely try it!  It's not Radiohead's best because they've invented a monster called OK COMPUTER, don't know if ever heard of it...  Anyway... Hail to the Thief is music buddy... not some mainstream peace of junk.  This will enhance your mind for music forever, just like any of their previous albums (except that one with Creep...their worst song).  And like every other of their albums you have to listen to it's intirety.  This album's in my collection.  I hope it's in yours too.  Thank for reading this.
0307276902|1.0|Many of us were familiar with this pack of lies in 2003 when it was still under radar and laughing about it back then. Frey hired the best PR people he could find to get Oprah's people to read the book; with the hook that it will help millions.  In fact, the opposite is true.  This book is harmful to true addicts because Frey suggests you can do it on your own; if you HOLD ON, which is similar to Nancy Reagan's JUST SAY NO. Frey also refuses to acknowledge that he got sober in an AA facility and worked the steps and got better. Stopped at the amends step; too bad, but in all likelyhood the priest is made up anyway. If you read carefully, the book is constructed like a screenplay which is Frey's true dream.  He wrote RAMBO IN REHAB... the tough guy, the tragic love story (as is Lilly ever existed what a joke) the mobster guy (right) the dentist scene to top MARATHON MAN (as if) he already admitted that he DID NOT have a hole in his face, but a cut on his lower lip on the airplane.  Anyway, I disgress, such a phony. Only if her were man enough (or sober enough) to admit this thing is fiction but now caught up in all that Oprah haze, he can't. She can't. She looks like a fool, her producers look like fools and now that the actual recovery community from Hazeleton is speaking out that this is false, is there anything else really to say here?  THis book has helped no one, an actual addict could be hurt by the false hope in the book, i wouldn not recommend it to anyone. It appealed mostly to housewives who watch Oprah, who enjoy the \\"true grit\\" ala same people that might like watching the surgery channel or desperate housewives or news disasters.  Once again, we see the pathetic taste of the American public but more pathetic one cheat is got rich.  If he was a true addict recovering with humility he would donate his money to Hazelton!  The very place that helped him in the first place, if he ever went there... i give no stars but you have to give at least one apparently.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|Cenerentola has been served well on DVD, with four fine productions available, but Ponnelle's film (set somewhere near the Victorian area, given the costumes) is truly an achievement. It's incredibly funny, has great musical values and is also very, very touching. A few of the jokes misfire, (I could do with less of the sister's squealing), but the production, filmed in and around La Scala, is wonderfully innovative. During the overture, we get a tour of the La Scala house and lobby, with it's statues of great Italian Composers singled out, especially that of Rossini (of course). This is a fairy tale with a genuinely happy ending, by the way, and it's exquisitely staged: The Magnificos, who have worn extravagant clothing and hair-dos throughout, appear at the wedding in Victorian grey, looking plain and penitent, only to be forgiven by a dewy-eyed Von Stade. The Sisters break down in tears, and Magnifico is wonderfully and genuinely humbled and forgiven. The scene is nowhere near as touching on the other videos.  <br /> <br /> Frederica Von Stade's exquisite Cinderella brought tears to my eyes with her performance of the finale: it's a testament to her skill that this was not her most famous role. It doesn't hurt, of course, that she is a genuine beauty. My Favorite moments: the look on her face as Cenerontola Discovers love in the Prince's Valet and then her wonderful, wonderful smile as she relives the ball and strokes the bracelet on her arm (only to hide it, with excellent comic timing, when her family comes back.) As her Prince Charming, Don Ramiro, Francisco Ariaza is in fine voice. His falling-in-love duet with Von Stade has to be heard to be believed, and his big aria goes over very well. <br /> <br />Paolo Montarsolo's Magnifico is simply the best on disk or video. His singing and diction are impeccable and his Mugging is less evident and more appropriately handled than in his performance as Basilio and Bartolo in Ponnelle's films of BARBIERE and NOZZE DI FIGARO Films. His Magnifico is both a cruel man, but he's not a buffoon and there's a something sympathetic about his downfall. His nearly-silent work in the finale shows that there was much more to his skill as a singing actor than being funny. <br /> <br />He matches wits with Claudio Desderi, an Excellent Dandini. Chubby-Faced and expressive, (he bares a passing resemblance to Dom DeLuise) he's an excellent musician and very funny. His opening ballad and ensemble features a wonderfully held line, excellent coloratura and impeccable patter.  He appears as Magnifico on another video, but his work is nowhere near as good as it is here.  <br /> <br />Paul Plishka is given an expanded role as Alidoro, who observes much of the antics of the other characters silently. He sings his aria well, and is provided with the production's one major departure from tradition. Usually, On the line \\"Look, and see who I am\\", Alidoro takes off his begger disguise and reveals his rich clothing. Here, Alidoro is already in his court dress, and on the aforementioned line, he points to the statue of Rossini, which comes to life. Plishka appears made up very convincingly as Rossini and, at one point, appears on screen with (and duets with) himself, as Alidoro appears to drive Cenerentola off to the ball. <br /> <br />The Sisters (Maria Guglielmi and Laura Zannani) both sing well and are very funny, though, as I said before, I could do without much of their squealing (which is not in the score). <br /> <br />Abbado repeats his fine work from his CD set (the Magnifico family are also the same). A true Rossian, his work is impeccable with an irreproachable sense of style and speed, making the all-important ensembles work like polished clockwork. Even without the visual aspect, this is one of the finest CENERENTOLAS on record. If the soundtrack to this film was released, I'd buy it in a second. <br /> <br />This film, by the way, makes an excellent companion to the Saltzburg Festival video withAnn Murray. Murray is nearly on Von Stade's level as a Cenerentola, Ariaza repeats his performance (if not in as fresh a voice), and plays Ramiro with an angry streak. Gino Quilico is good without approaching the brilliant Desderi as Dandini, and Walter Berry, while not on stable ground vocally, is a nasty Don Magnifico with very little that's funny about him, an interesting and appropriate characterization that counter-points Montarsolo's interestingly. There is an attractive (both physically and vocally) pair of sisters and Wolfgang Schone, a great Alidoro. Either of these Versions would be proud assets to a collection, but I would never want to be without Montarsolo, Von Stade, Desderi and Abbado. <br />
B0001LYH9S|3.0|I bought this CD when it first came out.  Not this enhanced version.  Loved 80% of it.  Would love 100% like I do for all his music.  But 2 songs seem to be just fillers: \\"I Am With Name\\" and \\"Wishful Beginnings\\".  It would have been more likelable if he took those out and kept \\"Get Real\\"   Not sure if I would buy the CD again just for one more song? <br />
B000002IHU|5.0|This is the album that define their music style. The guitar riffs of Crosby/ De Martini are terrific, you need to heard \\"Lay it down\\" and see what i'm talking about. The drummer Bobby Blotzer was one of the best drummers in the scene, and Juan Crucier with their bass lines makes a great contribution. This album along with \\"Dancing Undercover\\" are the essential  albums by Ratt. <br /> <br />
B000002RXS|5.0|My favorite singer singing my favorite opera. No other opera is so filled with fresh, innovative melodies... dramatic polar contrasts/opposites, and choir-multiple character interactions. No singer is as clean ( with accurate timing of gasps and rests) dramatic and prolific as Callas. In my mind this is the pinnacle of opera and most definitely of the non-Italian 19th century operatic landscape.
B000002LCE|5.0|<br />   In my opinion the last strong album that Dio ever made!!! Very melodic, incredible lyrics and a ambience keyboards that make's the listener wants for more.
B00007GZR0|4.0|Doris Day and Rock Hudson were the quintessential romantic team of the late fifties.  They made three romance classics together.  Tony Randall often was one or both's best friend. <br /> <br />In this film the two are married but his hypochondria threatens their marriage.  Tony is the next door neighbor.  The story is simple, they breakup but eventually find out they cannot live without each other. <br /> <br />Of their three films, this is definitely the weakest but if you are a fan of either Doris or Rock, then this is needed to complete their set. <br /> <br />There are some very funny scenes but not up to the quality of their first two. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B000002IJO|5.0|This album along with \\"Invasion of your privacy\\" define the greatest moment of Ratt's musicianship and lyrically. The guitar riffs are terrific, in the song \\"One good lover\\" in my opinion is the shining moment of Crosby/De Martini twin guitar attack. Other songs worth mention is \\"Drive me crazy\\", with a blasting solo courtesy of Robin Crosby. There is no filler here, so if you want one album of the Ratt's catalogue, this is the one.
B00005S6K8|4.0|The Larrabee's are a old money but moving with the times.  They keep their business growing by keeping up with technology.  Although, a merger by marriage is not out of the question. <br /> <br />Linus (Harrison Ford) is the responsible older brother, David (Greg Kinnear) is his irresponsible younger brother, Maude (Nancy Marchand) is the matriarch of the family.  Their trusted chauffer Fairchild (John Wood) has a gawky teenage daughter Sabrina (Julia Ormand).  Sabrina has a fantasy crush on David.  Fairchild sends Sabrina to Paris to finish her and make her forget David. <br /> <br />Eventually, she returns home, a much more polished woman.  Upon her return, she runs into David who invites her to a party (not knowing she's the chauffeur's daughter.)  David is falling for Sabrina and this does not please Linus (David is to marry Elizabeth Tyson to assure the merger.)  Linus steps in and parts Sabrina and David.  This works a little too well. <br /> <br />This is a remake of a classic Billy Wilder film.  I will state now that the original is a near perfect film with a perfect cast, Bogart, Holden and Audrey.  But this is a fun romance with its own fine cast. <br /> <br />Harrison Ford is excellent as Linus and shows that not only can he be romantic but funny.  This was Greg Kinnear's film debut and proved his likeability and charm (similar to Holden who was the proverbial second lead at the time the original came out).  And Ormand had already proved herself as an accomplished actress in French films, showed that she could handle a Hollywood film. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B000301YY8|5.0|I got this album back in nov-05,I love every song.  I listen to it every day LOVE IT.
B0002S64OG|2.0|I bought this after reading the reviews. I have 7 month old triplets who are captivated with all 9 of the Baby Einstein videos I own, no matter what age group they are for.<br /><br />This video did not produce that affect. It is pretty much a low budget BE knock-off, but what's missing is the puppet shows, which my babies love.<br /><br />These have computer animated animals and children's songs that are great... but must be targeted for older babies, because 3 out of 3 of my babies do not pay attention to those.  I am hoping they will like this video once the girls reach 1 year old.
B0000024JN|4.0|I'd have to say that I was the perfect age when this album came out. I was 15 and just into high-school. I had the tape, the shirt, and I thought it was so cool that on the cover, the numbers on the plane were 3MTA3. Sure there was rap and rock on albums before this, but this was the big splash right here. \\"Licensed To Ill\\" was stupid, loud, fun, and totally awesome. Not only did it contain the anthem of a generation in \\"Fight For Your Right\\", but every other track was great as well. Everybody loved the un-PC \\"Girls\\", \\"Brass Monkey\\", and I know a million people out there could still sing \\"Paul Revere\\" word for word. It definitely ushered in a new era of rap, rock, and alternative music in one package. I might not like it as much as their next album, but I still find \\"Time To Get Ill\\" often.
0307276902|4.0|By the age of 23 all that James Frey had accomplished in life was being and Alcoholic, a Drug Addict, and a Criminal. In this memoir his love-hate relationship with himself drives him almost to the point of dying. His journey through a Christian based drug rehab center will keep you reading until the end. His compelling tale speaks out against drugs and alcohol to help people everywhere. He learns to laugh, love, and live again. I would reccomend this book to anyone looking for something to keep them reading on.
B00003CWPL|3.0|For the artsy crowd. Can appreciate it but I wouldn't say it was entertaining though it was funny in spots. One thing I will say is I felt a little cold at the end. Must have been that howling wind throughout the movie.
0792163710|5.0|Shane is the typical power western.  It is about the small farmer versus the giant rancher.  The farm family is played by Van Heflin, Jean Arthur and a young Brandon de Wilde.  They are befriended by a retired gunslinger turned drifter, Shane (Alan Ladd). <br /> <br />When Shane dispatches the thugs, the rancher hires a professional (Jack Palance).  This culminates in the expected showdown in the bar. <br /> <br />What makes this film different from the others of its type is the subplot.  The young boy's adoration of the loner.  Brandon de Wilde's obsession of the loner is eerily similar to that of a stalker trying to emulate their obsession. <br /> <br />Alan Ladd as the title Shane, gives a perfectly controlled performance.  Director George Stevens also showed that he had future potential with this simple yet complex film. <br /> <br />This is a definite must for western film fans and those who like great character studies. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by director's son George Stevens jr. and associate producer Ivan Moffat. <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a great film that will stay with you days after you've seen it. It is a beautifully made and acted film with a story worth telling which is nice to see since that has become a Hollywood rarity. This is a movie that one should definatly give a chance, it is well worth your time. Both leads are very impressive escpecially Heath Ledger in what is indeed a career making performance. The story draws the heart and mind into full involvement. One cannot help but debate the nature of love and the horrible powers of prejudice and ignorance after seeing this film. A neccesary film for any film lover and a movie that has been long overdue. Daring, fresh, and worthy of every bit of praise it receives. A very high recommendation.
0800141660|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is the best feature film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  It is a typical Jane Austen plot.  Young women with no means looking for a good match.  The Dashwood sisters' father has passed away and they have lost their means of support.  The cousin who inherited the land has put them on a meager allowance and forced them to move to a small cottage with their mother (Gemma Jones). <br /> <br />Elinor (Emma Thompson) meets Edward Ferras (Hugh Grant) and she falls for him.  The problem is she finds that he is promised to another (Imogene Stubbs).  <br /> <br />While visiting neighbors, Marianne (Kate Winslet) meets the stoic Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  He falls in love at first sight with Marianne but the she meets the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and immediately falls for him.  Unfortunately, Elinor finds out that Willoughby has the reputation of toying with women. <br /> <br />In the end true love wins out.  Elinor & Edward and Marianne and Brandon marry. <br /> <br />This is a brilliant adaptation in every sense (& sensibility).  Ang Lee had success with a couple of Chinese films and proved that he could adapt into the English language film market.  In interviews he gave a lot of credit to Emma, stating that she worried how the lines were being said and he concentrated on the visual aspect of the film.  This made a perfect combination. <br /> <br />Emma wanted better roles and decided to adapt the book.  You can tell by her use of language that she loved the book and Austen's writing.  She deserved her Oscar for the screenplay.  She also deserved her Best Actress nomination.  She has shown in her two Ivory Merchant films (Howard's End and Remains of the Day), plus this, that she is the perfect period romance actress. <br /> <br />Kate Winslet had a success in an Australian film but this was the film that brought her to the attention of the mass market.  Alan Rickman was best known for playing villains so this was an unexpected surprise.  He showed that he has a truly romantic side.  The Hugh Grant stereotype, the befuddled gentleman, was created in this film.  <br /> <br />The production values from sets and costumes to music and cinematography are all first rate. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Commentary by Emma Thompson and producer Lindsay Doran <br />Commentary by Ang Lee and co-producer James Schamus <br /> <br />Emma Thompson Golden Globe Award acceptance speech - this is worth the price of the DVD alone. <br />
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Peter Jackson is an impressive filmmaker indeed. The King Kong story is not a very involving one, at least I never thought it really was, not until now. Jackson's new film is vastly superior to the original and the crummy 70's remake. This film has a heart which is rare to find in a popcorn film such as this. The acting is very impressive and the special effects are astounding. The films length didn't bother me really, I didn't find it boring at all. A good movie for some great adventure scenes and for a surprisingly emotional relationship between Kong and Watts.
B000BNI99K|5.0|Well, I got this box set as a gift from my brother, I find it really nice and interesting, it is great for a fan to know Rod Stewart still is important in music charts, I enjoy this albums eventhough many of the tracks are really new to me because being peruvian I have not listened to any song before but keep on thinking they are wonderful. Finally I wait for more rod stewart success on charts. <br />Jamel Cavero Gamboa
B000003NA3|5.0|This album has the best recorded version of \\"Softly as in a morning sunrise\\" (with quite possibly my favorite McCoy solo) that has ever been rendered and for that alone I have to give it 5 stars! However there was a 2 record set (issued back in the days of records) that also had this version on it along with my favorite things, after the rain and the beautiful Mal Waldron ballad Soul Eyes and I must say I believe that collection to be far superior (as well as far less expensive) to this if you could somehow find it. <br /> <br />  <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First of all... GORGEOUS animation. I have waited SO long for trailers in English and after getting the jist of it, I finally broke down and watched the Japanese version. Gorgeous, absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br />I'm a little interested to see the dubbed version because the english voices never seem to compare in infliction and emotion to the japanese... oh well. <br /> <br />The rumors on North American release were first around November of 2005, then supposedly it was January 19th, 2006 and now I'm reading on here March or April? Although, the other day while tracking about for other footage and reviews and what not, I saw some info that said Japan had exclusively released one million copies to America...? Well, whenever it gets here I take pride in knowing that I suckered... well, not suckered, INTERESTED my \\"husband\\" into this movie even though he put in his last hours with FFVII sometime a few years ago (say four or five perhaps?). He didn't follow the story too well, but he didn't need to... mainly what he was interested in was the animation. Hook. Line. Sinker. See you on the flip.
1565117700|5.0|The book has long been known as a classic, a masterpiece. The same can be said of Gary Sinese's reading. It makes the book and the characters come alive, as if they are with you, in the room or in the car.  An absolute masterpiece, both in writing and in the reading.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I had been meaning to see this movie for a long time. Ever since I got the soundtrack album for it, composed and performed by Peter Gabriel, I knew I had to check it out, since Peter never lends his name to productions that are not worth it. Indeed the wait was totally worth it! The movie combines visuals, music and performances in a way that I can only relate to the experience of watching \\"Until The End of the World\\" or \\"Whale Rider\\".<br /><br />The story takes place in Australia, during the first part of the XX century, at a time when the lives of the aboriginal people were controlled in an absurd manner, obligating them to do things for their \\"own benefit\\", such as separating the young children from their parents. Three little aboriginal girls escape a camp where children are kept and walk back over a thousand miles by the rabbit-proof fence that they remember leads back home, in an effort to reunite with their mothers.<br /><br />The performances by the girls, who were new to acting, will leave a deep mark in you, as will the impeccable music that accompanies the shots of the incredible spaces of the Australian outback. In a nutshell, \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" is well worth watching and, considering the movie is based on real-life stories, the movie makes you gain a deep respect for the aboriginal people of Australia and what they had to endure.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I'd never watched Firefly but had heard about it and was intrigued but didn't expect much other than a simple evening's entertainment.  This film is far, far better than I'd expected and a wonderful example of what scifi can be.  If George Lucas had an opportunity to see this before he made the Star Wars series, those movies might actually be watchable.  He might have seen what characterization, decent writing, compelling characters and heart and soul can do for a movie. There is more excitement and humanity in 20 minutes of Serenity than in any three of the bloated and annoying products of  Lucas's imagination.  Watch it and enjoy.
B00000DBXL|5.0|Like most people, I first heard Cake when they released \\"Fashion Nugget\\". But for me, it was this album that really made me a fan. I've since bought all their albums and I love them all, But this one is still my favorite.<br /><br />\\"Magic\\" is upbeat, witty, and fun. \\"Satan Is My Motor\\", \\"Mexico\\" \\"Guitar\\" are some favorites, but the whole thing is solid. Seriously, there isn't a weak track to be found. I think it's their most complete album.<br /><br />I highly recommend Prolonging the Magic, and all the other CAKE albums.
B0000508U6|5.0|In the words of Chris Martin \\"i think we're the biggest thing since slice bread\\". I couldn't have said it better myself. Now, are they unique in their musical style? No. Could they be the next Beatles? Maybe. Do they rock? HELL YEAH!!!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I suppose the one-line review of Kate Beckinsale's pseudo-horror star vehicle, \\"Underworld,\\" would be, \\"If you're going to see one movie this year about vampires fighting werewolves in a gothic metropolis, make it this one.\\"  Which could reasonably be interpreted as damning with faint praise. <br /> <br />Len Wiseman's first directorial effort results in a visually polished, darkly handsome film.  Set in the present day in an anoymous gothic city, peopled with beautiful-yet-dangerous creatures of the night who live in fantastic mansions and drive hot Europena cars, \\"Underworld\\" offers plenty of visual thrills.  The aforementioned Beckinsale, clad in a uniform of black leather that makes Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman suit look bulky, stalks the night as Selene, the top Death Dealer for the vampires.  What does it say about the 2001 monstrosity \\"Pearl Harbor\\" that Beckinsale gives a more convincing performance as a vampire than she did as a WWII nurse?   <br /> <br />Using a host of flashbacks, examinations of powerfully-illustrated history texts, and voice-over exposition, the film tells us that the vampires have been at war with the werewolves, or \\"Lycans,\\" for centuries.  Apparently, the lycans used to be the vampires' servants, but then got uppity.  There's also a smidgen of a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" romance that played a role, but that's not the focus of this story.  While the war is sometimes fought with fangs and claws, it's also fought with guns and high-tech ammunition.  They stop fighting long enough to mutter ominous portents about \\"returns,\\" and \\"prophecies,\\" and \\"the war.\\"  Nobody is having much fun being a vampire or a werewolf. <br /> <br />And that ultimately is what \\"Underworld\\" boils down to - not that much fun.  It looks great, but despite the special effects (which are very convincing), there's just not that much point to it all.  Allegedly, Selene has a \\"romance\\" with a human, Michael (Scott Speedman), who is fated to play an important role in the war.And there's also Viktor, a \\"hibernating\\" elder vampire who gets brought back to life by Selene \\"a century ahead of schedule.\\"  There are a few delicious moments as god-of-camp Bill Nighy (\\"Love Actually\\") sinks his teeth into the Viktor role, but there could have been so much more here.  <br /> <br />While ostensibly a movie in the \\"horror\\" genre, it's really more of an action film.  There are no moments of genuine terror, and most of the potentially scary moments dissolve into hastily-cut action scenes.  This isn't a criticism, just an observation about a movie that was hyped (at least to me) as a horror film. <br /> <br />There's a bit much going on with the names in \\"Underworld.\\"  When a sleazy vampire is named \\"Craven,\\" you're crossing the line from \\"showing\\" to \\"telling.\\"   <br /> <br />You do have to give the filmmakers credit for cojones, however.  The movie is an obvious set-up to a series, and it takes some serious confidence if you believe that you are guaranteed a series of big-budget films based on this visually-splendid trifle.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is the album that turned sparked my interest in music so much, my CD collection has quadrupled in size since '03. Despite having a couple average tracks, I still gove this album 5 stars, The best songs are just that good, and the rest are still enjoyable listens. Theres nothing else out there quite like the sound of Wayne's voice next to those pshycadelic sounds and electronic noises. The concept of a Japanese woman fighting pink robots does sound juvenile to the un-initiated, but its actually quite brillinat. Ive never tired of playing this album.
0316286850|5.0|Kevyn Aucoin's book is so very interesting, just to see what can be done.  Then if you want, how to do it.  His personal attitude about makeup and life is so right-on. (to coin an old, but apt phrase) I love the way he invites people to spurn the fashion nazi's, and encourage people to be and look how they want.  He ranges from the sweet natural look to the avant-gard all with instructions and photos. Many including a before and after, and diagrams. Great ideas to try. Fun just to even look through and marvel at.
B00008YJH5|5.0|The pixies are the MOST underrated band . . .EVER.  I realize that their popularity has grown since their break up, but when the best band of the 90's (nirvana) says that you're their greatest influence, you're doing something right.  Every song on this CD throws so many different ideas at you in usually less than 3 minutes.  That's impressive.  Also, the songs are so diverse that it never gets borring . From the edgy break my body to the poppy gigantic, which is the best song on the cd IMO it's all pure orriginality in the best form humanly possible.  I heart the pixies.  They are definately a band that is an aquired taste, considering i completely hated them for the first 3 months i had their cds, now their my favs.
0141439513|5.0|I have read this famous Jane Austen's classic when I was a kid. I remembered I loved it so much and it remained as my favorite for a long time. This second time is even better! Can't say enough how I enjoyed reading it. The conversations between characters are so vivid, and the stoy flows so smoothly on. It was such a pleasant journey and I can't stop reading until I finished.
B00078XGRO|5.0|Naw, it doesn't really have the same ring as 'Damn it, Jim...' does it? However, this is still the only Next Gen movie that comes even close to the genius of The Wrath Of Khan, The Voyage Home and Undiscovered Country. <br /> <br />First Contact is the Next Gen crew at their very best, and this intelligently scripted movie excels at all levels. There are also so many excellent performances in here, including a stunning Alice Krige as The Borg Queen, that this movie will keep the average fan on the edge of her/his seat. <br /> <br />Yet it is not all intensity, and Marina Sirtis turns in a hilarious and quite frankly, very sexy performance as a tipsy Deanna Troi. It is the increased warmth between the crew members that stirs echoes of the Classic Trek crew, and had the Next Gen movies been able to duplicate the high standard set by First Contact, they would have won over a lot more fans. Sadly, Insurrection and Nemesis never delivered on the promise of this genuine classic. <br /> <br />Will they make another movie to repair the lost credibility over Nemesis? I don't know. After all, I'm just a reviewer Jim, not a miracle worker. <br /> <br />Definitely an important purchase. Damn it.
0333710932|5.0|I agree with comments below.  This is an adorable story with fantastic vocabulary. It is too bad that this book is not easier to find in the USA.    FYI: it is available in hardcover, paperback as well as a board book for younger children - be aware of what you are ordering
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle is supposed to be a comedy but it's so much more than that. The story begins with a rather serious scene when the entire Crocodile gang is taken out by the dancing, powerful, and notorious Axe Gang. After getting to know their power you are then introduced to the stupidity of Sing and his sidekick.<br /><br />The two want to be members of the Axe Gang but they can't fight and they are too wimpy to pull off any crimes. Sing tries to fool a barber in Pig Sty alley, which is a district that had no trouble because of poverty. Sing starts something he can't finish when he sends a fake distress call used by gangs when in the need of help. The Axe gang isn't pleased when they find a district of broke people picking on two fake members of their gang but somehow they didn't notice they had nothing to do with their gang.<br /><br />Not only does Sing get the district in trouble he unknowingly gets the Axe Gang in trouble. There are heroes within the district but you would never think these guys  were anyones hero, one is a tailor, the other a cook, and the last is just a hard labor worker. None of them look like heroes but they are and man can they fight. I know Kung Fu Hustle is supposed to be funny but to me it was just a perfectly blended masterpiece. The fight sequences were amazing and like nothing you've ever seen before and the story is gripping. There's one scene where these two assassins use sound waves as a weapon so maybe that helps to show how unique this is.<br /><br />My only problem was some things were a little too fake or digitalized and this made some of the fights not as good as others. I recommend watching this film in subtitles and not in the English dialogue. Seeing it in English just takes away from the film because you miss most of what is really being said. The music is great because it adds extra edge and suspense to the film.
0060934913|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud and feel utterly disgusted in a good way. As a talented writer and chef, Tony Bourdain gives you an inside look at the restaurant business and funny,  autobiographical tidbits that combined make this book one of the best I've read in years. <br /> <br />If you like eating out, you can't pass this book up. Digest this book thoroughly. You won't regret it!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I'm going to see this show sometime this summer, and I am in love with the soundtrack in the meantime. I loved Idina Menzel when I saw the Rent movie (Maureen), and one of my friends got me hooked on Wicked. Another awesome production, I can tell from the music. I've seen probably every picture there is to see from the original show (Idina, Kristin) and read the book. I absolutely adore Fiyero, he's brilliant.<br /><br />My top 5 fave songs are (in no particular order):<br /><br />What is This Feeling -- what's not to love about unadulterated loathing?<br /><br />Dancing Through Life -- it showcases Fiyero's talents wonderfully<br /><br />Defying Gravity -- Idina gives it her all with an awesome endiing<br /><br />As Long As You're Mine -- the love song we've all waited for!<br /><br />For Good -- best friends parting ways, I've cried on several occasions<br /><br />The entire CD is amazing, I usually set my player on shuffle to hear everything when I go to sleep. Can't wait to see the performance!
0307276902|1.0|Since I'm not a drug addict, I cannot say if this would be any benefit to someone with dependency issues, however since it seems to promote Mr. Frey's \\"superhuman\\" ability - and dishonors any proven establishment (medical, psychological or spiritual), I'd say it's a disservice to them. Mr. Frey was brought up with a sibling in a nice house with parents who were happily married and well-traveled. Seems to me that he took advantage of them and now wants to simply whine on paper. For me, it was a waste of time and money. There's enough depressing stuff in the world. Most of Oprah's selections are worth the effort, so I stuck through this one until the end and still can't stop shaking my head.  Marley and Me would have been a much better choice, Oprah. Sorry.  The only thing this book did is make the author/liar, Mr. Frey, a richer man.

B0001WTUH6|5.0|Selene is a vampire Death Dealer, one who lives to hunt and kill Lycans. She seeks revenge on all Lycans because she is told by Viktor, her dark father, that Lycans killed her family. She enjoys her job until she meets Michael, a human recently turned into a Lycan. Selene is torn between her coven and her feelings for Michael.<br /><br />Michael is a human hunted by the Lycans for his unique DNA. When he is bitten by a Lycan, he is pulled into the middle of a centuries old war of Vampires against Lycans.<br /><br />The war between the Vampires and the Lycans has raged for centuries, but the Vampires think that most of the Lycans are dead after their leader, Lucian, is killed. Selene uncovers a possible betrayal of the coven when she discovers that Lucian is very much alive. This sets off a series of events leading to the revelation that the war was not started the way Selene was told it was started. Lies, betrayal and forbidden love all come to an explosive finale.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie because I thought the story was good, creating an intriguing myth for the relationship between Vampires and Lycans. Underworld moved along at a fast pace, keeping the viewer interested. At first, the good guys and the bad guys seem clear until the end when the truth is revealed. The look and feel of the movie was dark and gloomy, which fit perfectly with the story. Well-developed characters dominate the screen, breathing life into ancient mythic creatures. I especially liked Selene with her dour attitude and how she stood up to the controlling Kraven. You go girl! What I also liked about her character is that her hair was messed from the rain and all the fighting she was doing, which is realistic. She still looked hot. I hate when female warriors have hair that does not move or get messed up after fighting. I would have loved to see more romance develop between Selene and Michael. Hopefully this will happen in the sequel. I highly recommend this movie to fans of dark fantasy and vampire and werewolf lore.s of dark fantasy and vampire and werewolf lore.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|I don't know if it was the loss of Head that completely destroyed Korn's old sound, but something did it, and the result is not great. This album was highly anticipated by many, and proved to be overall disappointing.  <br /> <br />It does have its high points that rock as hard as any Korn track of old, which include Twisted Transistor, Politics, Hypocrates, Liar, and For No One. Although these five songs are all very good and demonstrate the evolution which would be appropriate for Korn, the album as a whole is just weighed down too much by the slowness and weakness of the rest of it.  <br /> <br />One good thing that Jonathan Davis did on this record was looking to other sources of lyrical inspiration than his own pain and sorrow, which was beginning to become cliche Korn, but it is obvious that musically they are not where they should be with this one.
0688002307|5.0|I decided to re-read this book now that I am older, have my own bike, know a little bit more about Buddhism, and (showing my non-Buddhist material side) wanted to convert a ragged paperback to a hardback for my permanent library.  It was certainly better than the first time around, but my favorite quote is still right at the front of the book, \\"We want to make good time, but for us now this  measured with emphasis on 'good' rather than 'time' and when you make a shift in emphasis the whole approach changes.\\"  This is a book I can hopefully read many more times in my lifetime and an easy five star.  This version was the 25th anniversary edition and has a new introduction from Pirsig.
055380457X|2.0|If the authors cut down on the fats they have put in this book while telling the story about Google (more specifically, about its founders), the book will be one third the size, more readable and perahps even less expensive. It sounded like Brin and Page were superhumans throughout the book. I expect a thorough analysis of the mistakes made by google (and any organization I am reading about), which the authors failed to deliver. <br />Overall, I was disappointed with the approach of someone writing about the most exciting internet phenonmenon without even interviewing the founders very well. Sounds like the book was written in a bit if haste.
0312330537|5.0|Soon (2007) to be a first run movie staring Johnny Depp as Lin, how could this not be a great book?  Actually, it is a great book.   A bit on the long side, but really interesting and entertaining.   Also, when one considers that it may be partially autobiographical it becomes even more interesting.  My mother-in-law purchased this for me as a gift totally unprompted and unrequested based upon a recommendation from a local book store.  I would have never purchased it myself (like Mary Karr), but I have since purchased a total of four copies for others and recommended it to at least as many more.  Certainly a five star rating from me and I really look forward to the movie.
B0002S947K|4.0|It took many spins for me to warm up to this CD.  At first, I was generally unimpressed.  But, after repeat plays, it grew on me and the rootsy vibe clicked.  Ray sings much like Van Morrison. He does not sound like Van, but sings from the soul like Van.  This is a great CD for chilling out.  A very impressive debut for an artist that will be around for years to come.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|Dude, like this movie is totally awesome. Like my homie and I were chillin' back wit it.

But then the pimp daddy came back and when they blew up the Death Star, yo that was dope!!!    But my dog was like totally disrespectin' this flick. He be trippin' sayin' Star Trek is better than Star Wars. I said, \\"Man don't be playin' like that. SW is like tricked out and ST ain't got H.S. Pimp Daddy, you know what I'm sayin'?\\" But he was like, \\"But what about Troi's but?\\" Then I was trippin' cuz I like big buts and I cannot lie. So I was like, \\"Word.\\" I don't want to be dissin' SW cuz it's still stacked, but ST is the Mack. It like reins supreme, you know what I'm sayin'?      **********SPOILER ALERT*************    For those who didn't know, Darth Vader is actually Luke's father.

0385510454|4.0|I loved this book. I am a Grisham fan but not certainly a literary expert.<br /><br />I loved the characters, the plots, the irony of a lot of them, and wanted to ask for more than the 3 stars it has been averaging.This is a 5 star book.<br /><br />Some one John's books have been life changers in their own ways.<br /><br />The Broker re-affirem true love and romance and was a wonder travel log of Italy just after I left on a too brief visit.<br /><br />It is not anything like standard Grisham but that makes me love it all the more. Please read the book. You will never be sorry.<br /><br />It is one I will read again
0307276902|4.0|As someone who has been addicted, and gone to rehab, I could relate to this book in a lot of ways.  Never mind the fact that it's exaggerated for dramatic affect.  (of all the drunks I've known, none of us could remember a black out with such vivid detail as Frey does)   <br /> <br />But the ironies are these:  <br />1) He denounces AA, which in and of itself does not bother me.  I too have had my moments with AA - though ultimately it did save my life.  But what gets me is that the fellowship of those guys he hung out with, with whom he got close, shared stories etc in rehab,  that's what kept him around.  And that's what AA's about really.  Not a devotion to a god so much as being around people that share  your addiction.  So he misses the point.  the second irony is ..  <br /> <br />2) That AA is all about getting honest with yourself.  If Frey had become involved in the program he probably would not have lied about the factual accuracy of his book.  Of course, he's a wealthy liar now.   <br /> <br />All of this notwithstanding, I really enjoyed reading the book, fabrications and all.  It took me back to a time and place that was very raw emotionally.  enjoy.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World at War DVD set is a must have for your collection. Truly a masterpiece documentary on WW2. From the start to end, every chapter is compelling and accurate. It grabs you and brings you to the reality of war. So many words to describe how fantastic this DVD set is. Real footage of battle and great interviews of the particpants of battle. I would recommend this DVD for anyone just for historical purposes alone. A great teaching aid for World History!
B00005NC66|5.0|A movie more famous for style than substance, though it set the movie world on its head. A third-rate hood in Paris (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who thinks he's Bogart, steals a car, then kills the policeman who pulls him over. Now on the lam he goes to his girlfriend (Jean Seberg) and asks her to hide him until he can collect some money owed him from a previous job; after that he tells her they will go to Rome. But Seberg is as empty, soul-less, and finally ruthless as he is, and at the end she turns him in to the police.<br /><br />But it's the way Goddard relates the story that had everyone ga-ga over this movie masterpiece: he presented new ways of viewing his material - fast-cutting, imaginative camera angles, a total breakdown of time and space, no transitions. His idea was to give the impression of \\"living in the moment.\\" There are some memorable scenes, especially the bedroom scene with Belmondo and Seberg discussing art and philosophy and the final shot of Seberg, but at times it's very hard to relate to these two conscienceless, amoral characters; I know it's all about alienation and impetuosity, but whew!<br /><br />The location photography on the streets of Paris is superb and set another precedent for New Wave filmmaking. Excellent too is the musical score (part jazz, part classical). It's an extremely influential movie, groundbreaking and revolutionary, though some of it's most creative techniques (jump-cutting, for example) have become second nature today.

You're thinking that this is just another guitar book just like all those other ones you bought and never finished because you couldn't get through the first chapter, I know. I said Fu*k it and spent the 13 bucks on a book that produced immediate results for me in 1 hour. Guitar comes very naturally for a few but we all love it the same. We keep playing hoping that one day all those lessons and thoughts will connect and finally pay off. Stop dreaming and start playing great music. BUY THIS BOOK!
B00006879E|4.0|I never heard of Maroon5 until I saw them on the playlist at the radio station where I work. <br /> <br />I was prepared to hate them being a close minded old geezer, but I couldn't! <br /> <br />Maroon5 is a definate breath of fresh air in a sea of one dimensional bands out there today. <br /> <br />This album will still be heard on the radio 20 years from now
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I first heard Panic! At the Disco on Sirius and immediately I knew I had to buy the CD, although I wouldn't describe PATD as a band that would normally appeal to me. It was just so catchy! I was worried that the rest of the CD wouldn't be the same way and I was blown away with what I discovered- not only is the rest of the CD catchy and great to listen to, but all the songs are well written and executed. It's one of the CDS that you just listen to once and it's stuck in your head for the rest of the day. What a great find!
B000BNX3B4|2.0|So, should a good husband/boyfriend bring this home for the little lady?  No.  I double dog dare you to read on...<br /><br />Plot: sad divorcees search the internet for love<br /><br />This is not a romantic comedy.  It's a drama about how depressing it is for your spouse to cheat on you and leave you.  It's framed on the ridiculous notion that everyone should do whatever it takes to be happy.  I say ridiculous because by that same logic, Diane Lane's hubby and John Cusack's babe were both justified in making our lead characters miserable.  The only glimpse we get of comedy is Christopher Plummer walking around with a goofy smile on his face throughout the entire film, no doubt under the impression that this feature was supposed to be a comedy.<br /><br />Cusack's character is supposed to be neurotic.  I know my boy Johnny can pull off neurotic -- I'll stand by SAY ANYTHING as one of the greatest character-driven movies of all time!  But in MUST LOVE DOGS, it's like we're watching some guy off the street impersonating Cusack as a neurotic.<br /><br />The film makes 2 points:<br /><br />(1) Diane Lane will still be hot when she turns 60.<br /><br />(2) Photoshop is a user-friendly software.<br /><br />Anyone who's ever spent valuable work time putting coworkers faces on exciting bodies of other humans or animals knows that Photoshop takes TONS of practice.  I found that plot point very misleading.  My wife needs to understand that what I do to people isn't easy at all.
B0006L16N8|2.0|This is an OVER PRODUCED album.  I am pretty sure that the four men of Coldplay could have used their money on something a litte more meaningful than this pittiful album.  Martin's lyrics are totally annoying and Buckland is trying way too hard to sound cool while playing the guitar.  The boys should stick to what they know; and that is piano, acoustic and base.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Both my parents were Pentecostal ministers.  My father was gay and my mother's mission in life was to save/change him.  At one point around the age of 14 or 15 I babysat for my father's boyfriend's son. My father died a deeply depressed, broken unfulfilled man still blaming my mother for protecting me from him and preventing our relationship.  The marriage was what they thought God wanted... a marriage of duty not love.  I came out to my parents at 18.  My father knew I was gay but never sat and talked honestly with me about his situation.  Around the age of 26 I became depressed and my mother swooped in hoping to succeed where she had failed with my father and talked me into entering a (teen challenge) sponsored program that claimed they could change gay men.  For one year I worked hard, did as I was told, read or viewed nothing from the outside, memorized scripture, abstained from sex of any kind, fasted for 11 days while cooking for 16 people and prayed.  After one year they told me I was changed and released me into the world.  I was being encouraged to marry a girl from my parent's church but no one asked if we were in love.  After a few months of honest reflection I ended the relationship and went on my way to live my life as intended.<br /><br />Gay people are accused of having an agenda.  Just read the above and tell me honestly who really has the agenda.  The gay agenda is to end the lies, hate, bondage, brutality and destruction.<br /><br />I went to see Brokeback  Mountain last weekend.  At first I was stunned... then overwhelmed with sadness as I saw my father's life decisions repeated in front of the world.  The sadness turned to empathy and understanding of the terrible anguish my father went through trying to change.  My thoughts then turned to my mother's pain caused by her misguided mission of beating her head against the stone wall of my father's orientation.  Again the sadness set in as I realized what a destructive force this misguided agenda to suppress gays is to entire families.  Then I felt something lift from me realizing that so many people would see the destructive forces at play in our society.  The rug is being lifted and the dirt of silence and oppression underneath is being exposed.  There was a time when mixed race love was treated the same way.  Thank you E. Annie Proulx, Ang Lee and all those with the courage to be involved with this project.  Thank you for exposing the truth and wreckage.<br /><br />I am 52 now and have been in love with and living with the same man for 27 years.  There are many things the laws and lack of equal rights deny us but nothing can keep us from loving each other.  Jack Twist was right... It is possible to be gay, in love and happy.enda to suppress gays is to entire families.

B0007NFL18|2.0|i gave this album less than 3 stars because it has more bad songs than good ones. <br />i think there are many tracks 50 shuldve left out. <br />some of the songs aren't bad and have a real grimy feeling to it like get in my car,im supposed to die tonight,in my hood. <br />there are about 12 songs in this album 50 shuldve left out or replaced with something else.
B0006399FS|4.0|Although it was produced by Lillywhite, this album has a lot of similarities with ALYCLB.  Probaly you can pair up some songs: Vertigo and Elevation, Beautiful day and City of Blinding Lights, Kite and Sometimes you can't make it on your own.  The sad fact is that after the poor POP acceptance in the US, U2 was forced to land to safe ground instead of continuing the experimentation of new sounds and rhythms. <br />It is an excellent album with very meaningful and personal lyrics that help me to instantly connect with it, despite of the lack of musical experimentation and innovation I was used to especially after the release of AB.
B0000029DD|5.0|Mr. Buckley's was certainly a gifted man. <br /> <br />Not only is his voice beyond description, the songs he writes are beautiful, ghostly and even tragic. <br /> <br />Mojo Pin sets the somber mood. Jeff demonstrates his traditional style of singing. It goes from a waver through each chorus to a painful wail near the end, ultimately climaxing the piece.  <br /> <br />The title-track Grace has this folky sort of greensleeves type of melody going about it. Doesn't lose too much momentum with this one. <br /> <br />Then we go to the forgettable last goodbye. Not really as good as Jeff gets on the album, but still it sets you for the next terrific piece. <br /> <br />Lilac Wine is a masterpiece, one of the best songs on the album. It is a cover, but Buckley's style really brings out his own version of the song. (Sadly, some of his best songs were covers) There's a sense of motion to the song that really grips me every time I hear it. <br /> <br />Then So Real is another average song. But that chorus is hauntingly beautiful. <br /> <br />When I first heard Hallelujah, as was probably everyones first song to hear off the album, I was amazed. One that a man could possess a voice of that calibur, and two that someone could really top Leonard Cohen. I think the beauty about the song is that Cohen never really was that dynamic of a singer, a very cynical singer if you will. But Buckley made that song his own, like it or not, his angelic voice and Cohen's deep lyrics turn this into an instant classic. Oh yeah, and the guitar part is tear-jerkingly beautiful. <br /> <br />Lover, You Should've Come Over is Buckley's best song that he wrote by himself. A little to scarily like the Titanic soundtrack at first... but this pretty much puts Celine Dion to shame. It's another bittersweet tale by Buckley about his lover, of course. <br /> <br />Corpus Christi Carol is another great cover. You really hear his range in this song. <br /> <br />Eternal Life is a nice rocker, really comesout and smacks you in the face. It's very cool. <br /> <br />Dream Brother is the haunting outro of Grace. It sends chills down your spine once you've finished, and gives you a sense of unfullfillment...which sucks...but is great at the same time. <br /> <br />As much as I lavishly described this album, I honestly think some people are being too indulgent in Buckley's masterpiece. His voice actually sounds untrained, which is part of the beauty. But he was not the greatest singer ever, nor is this the greatest album ever...sorry <br /> <br />But it is a VERY overlooked gem of the nineties. 4.5 Stars. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, if you don't already know, he drowned in the Mississippi river before he could release his next album... sad...yup. I guess it makes this album, and Jeff Buckley's profile even more of an enigma.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Ok did he even read the freakin book? Obvilusly not or else he would have made a better movie. <br /> <br />I am obsessed with All thing Harry Potter so obviously I was extremly excited to see this movie, after it was over I almost cried at how bad it was.  Curon chopped and hacked and tore this story until it was barly recognizable as Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban. I won't even go into all of the things that were left out and distorted by tis movie because it would take too long to write. I do have a couple questions though like: <br />WTF is with the kids wearing street clothes? They don't do that in the book so why do they do it in the movie? <br />Why did he change the layout of Hogwarts? The Whompimg Willow wasn't even on school grounds in the movie and since when is Hogwarts the site of Stonehinge? <br /> <br />When I saw this movie I felt betrayed and saddened and I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone who is a Potter-Head because you WILL be disapointed, very disapointed. <br /> <br />I gave it 2 stars because it is a Harry Potter product.
B000001FKY|5.0|A few weeks ago, scavenging through my somewhat extensive tape collection, dating back to the end of the ice age, Hysteria came into view, and so did my memories of the 1980's. Those of us reared on Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple during the wacky seventies, Def Leopard seemed to be the new force in \\"true\\" rock and roll for the old and new generation. Here was AC/DC with a Pop sound and songs you could bang your head to. Needless to say, I immediately jumped in my car and slotted the relic in the player. Wow, I thought, these songs still sound good, particularly, \\"Pour Some Sugar On It\\" and \\"Animal\\". Here was a great English band that, in my opinion, has withstood the test of time, as their music will continue to resonate when most of us are dead and forgotten.<br /><br />Hysteria is considered by rock pundits and historians to be one of the top ten rock albums of the late twentieth century. The album's history and its development is a tragedy but a lesson on the strength of the human spirit.<br /><br /> As the story goes, drummer, Rick Allen, was involved in a near fatal car accident, alive but unfortunately lost his left arm. For anyone, particularly a drummer, this would be devastating. The band was about to start production on Hysteria, and actually had a few rough tunes put together, however, all work came to a standstill. The boy's got together and decided, out of respect for Rick, not to continue working on the album. Over a year after the near fatal accident, Rick taught himself to play the drums with one arm. Joe Elliot, lead singer, managed to get the famous Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange to produce the album. The band had previously had a successful tour in the U.S. with their previous album, which included one of their greatest songs, \\"Photograph\\", and was intent on surpassing that album.<br /><br />Well, after two years of constant work, they succeeded. When the album was finally finished, the band decided to put out \\"Women\\" as a single. (It didn't do very well) They then put out \\"Animal\\" which skyrocketed up the American charts. The Hysteria tour across America and the world rank, in terms of success, with the Rolling Stones. These northern England working-class boy's had truly made it and had become a significant force in Rock and Roll history.<br /><br />Many rock experts have said that Def Leopard, more than any other band, is the \\"icon\\" band of the 1980's. Listening to Hysteria again after many years, I would have to agree, because their music filled the airways during the decade of greed, sparking some great memories.<br /><br />If you like great Rock and Roll, eighties style, buy this CD, you'll not be disappointed.<br /><br />An easy five starsy well) They then put out \\"Animal\\" which skyrocketed up the American charts.

B0002OERI0|5.0|To give some context for the following review, I am a punker since Punk was new. I saw the Ramones, Dead Boys, and Tuff Darts (among others) in Houston around 1978-79, when I was 17 years-old. I love Punk music, and loved Green Day's first album, but really haven't listened to anything from Green Day until American Idiot. American Idiot reminds me of why I loved Punk from the very beginning.<br /><br />I saw Green Day in September 2005 because a friend had an extra ticket. It was at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts where the Patriots play. I enjoy Green Day a lot, but I have real mixed feelings about the show. To me, Punk was never meant to be played in a stadium, but I guess if it ever was to happen, at least it's Green Day. In that venue, with so many teenie-boppers, I pondered whether I was witnessing the death of Punk. In some ways it felt very satisfying if I was... like a chapter has closed and now there's room for something new. And if I was really witnessing it, it was a fabuous death.<br /><br />One incredibly satisfying moment occured when, during one of too many audience call and answer periods, and while Billy Joe began to moan (and the audience moaned back) he slipped his hand down the front of his pants and whimpered, \\"somebody suck me.\\"  I knew in a flash that he'd just freaked out a whole bunch of chaperoning moms and dads, while at the same time I was thinking, yes, yes, yes!... affirming for me that the makers of the music have the same spirit that drew me to Punk in my teens, and it felt exactly the same. If Green Day can produce an album like American Idiot (which I really do like a whole lot) and take their show to stadium proportions, I wonder where they can go from here? I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to disband after this tour. It almost seems like it would be the right thing to do.
B000067G3C|1.0|Man, this movie sucks.  Make no mistake, I am a man.  I like my movies manly and violent.  I just wanna point this out, cause so many people love to write reviews for things that they wouldn't generally care for, which is pretty worthless.  I have nothing against 'Speed' in theory, or action movies in theory, anyway.  Basically, 'Speed' lives on its gimmicky premise.  The trouble is, this premise proves to be exceedingly dull.  Riding the bus is not especially thrilling.  In fact, actually riding the bus is more interesting than this film: there are often crazy people on the real bus.  Also, you can play a game to try and determine which of the 5 cell phone conversations that you are overhearing is the most asinine. (This is futile, however.  They are all always banal beyond belief.)  Then the movie goes on for a lot longer than it should've, and simply becomes silly and moronic rather than tedious, so it covers all its bases, I guess.  Also, it has the obnoxious, loathsome Sandra Bullock and a particularly dull Keanu Reeves.  Hopper hams it up, as he ought to, but he's a lot less fun than usual.  That's the ultimate problem with this movie-- it's stupid and tedious, but in a pious, serious way.  You can't laugh at this the way you can lotsa crappy action movies.  All you can do is groan, sigh, yawn and finally, sleep.<br /><br />Grade: D-
B00006JIA4|5.0|I can speak for the hard-core fans, because I'm only a casual Queen fan who's familiar with their biggest songs.  I like this compilation because Disc 1&2 have legitimate, original versions.  I consider Disc 3 like a \\"Bonus Disc,\\" because it's basically a bunch of collabos.  But for the price and quality, this would be a good buy for any casual Queen fan.  I bought it retail and was very pleased.  Thanks, have a good one!
B000000OQF|4.0|For the longest time I'd felt fairly ambivalent towards Guns N' Roses.  They generally had some pretty decent instrumental work, but the vox were mostly shrill and obnoxious.  That, and they are a bit mainstream as far as my taste for hard rock and heavy metal is concerned.  But, a dedicated student of the hard rock and metal like myself can only go so long w/o picking up such a legendary album.  And what can I say, it's good.  Not a masterpiece, I don't think, but solid thru and thru, for what it is.  I still find Axl's voice to be a bit grating most of the time, but it sounds better when you're actually listening to an album, as it always does, and the band is plenty rocking.  So it's a good time, definitely worth the cash.<br /><br />Guns N' Roses never were a hair metal band, though they aren't really what I'd call heavy metal either.  They're just a driving hard rock band with a slightly rough, vaguely punkish edge. (Or, they are here, anyway.)  Stradlin and Slash are both fine guitarists, and the leads on this album are uniformly strong, though they aren't always utterly memorable.  The rhythm section is unobtrusive, but driving, and they can groove pretty well when they try to.<br /><br />The album has no weak tracks, though they aren't all exactly mind-blowing either.  For the longest time I'd never been certain whether or not I liked the song 'Welcome to the Jungle', or hated it.  Turns out I like it and it's one of the best tracks.  Some of Axl's vocal affectations are irritating, but it's just a great, pulsing rock song.  'Nightrain' is a great one.  Perhaps the catchiest chorus here, some of the better vocals.  'Mr. Brownstone' is an interesting one, a rather funky track, kinda a heavier, modernized 'Trampled Under Foot'.  It's pretty good, though it doesn't groove quite as much as it probably ought to.  For the longest time I'd never cared for 'Paradise City', but upon listening to it on the album a buncha times I've determined that I like it, too.  Again, it's probably a little to repetitious, but it's undeniably catchy and has some really awesome leadwork, the best on the album.  'Sweet Child O' Mine' is another uncertain one.  The second half is pretty good, but the first half has got some really shrill guitarwork, and is just a little to syrupy overall.  However, the darker second half of the song is interesting enough to carry the whole thing, and it works well in providing an unexpected contrast.  'Rocket Queen' is the closer and is one of the best tracks here.  Probably the best, most propulsive rhythm work on the whole album, and another good chorus to go along with some more unexpected dynamics.<br /><br />I guess I don't have too much to say about this album.  Just a quality hard rock album, energetic and rocking and all that.  Check it out.Again, it's probably a little to repetitious, but it's undeniably catchy and has some really awesome leadwork, the best on the album.  'Sweet Child O' Mine' is another uncertain one.

B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's follow-up to OK Computer proved to be quite an interesting ordeal. Kid A is a fascinating and almost completely electronic transcendental experience. Thom Yorke is harder to understand than ever, (remember this is before Amnesiac) and the band's experimental sound reaches new heights with tracks like \\"In Limbo,\\" \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" and \\"Morning Bell.\\" Even though that this album is only 10 tracks, all of the songs hold their own, and upon repeat listens, reveal intricacies that reward the listener. My personal favorite is \\"How to Dissapear Completely\\" - a soft, meloncholic song that is orchestrated with strings, while rhythmic acoustic guitar and a smooth bassline push things along. Its a dreamy song that, like so many of the other tracks provide the listener with a soundscape that carries the listener far off places. The album is strange, hard to listen to, and has been called garbage by many people. However, don't dismiss it, because you'll be missing out on a great experience. (btw i dont do drugs-hehe)
B0009F9O6W|5.0|In the late 70's I ventured into a garage sale in the farms of Michigan and found this album for a buck (along with some King Crimson fare).  Imagine some farm boy listening to art rock!  I didn't know anything about VDGG, but I picked up on a couple tid-bits form the album jacket: 1) Robert Fripp appeared on the album on a couple tracks--this was a good sign; and 2) John Anthony was the producer.  Why did that ring a bell?  Well, in the early-mid 1970s, John Anthony was the producer for 3 bands (of which I was aware): GENESIS, ROXY MUSIC, and QUEEN (Queen I); and now VDGG (All right, it is a little geeky that I knew who John Anthony was when standing at this garage sale).  Enough said.  If you like Nursery Cryme and Trespass, you can't go wrong. <br />This is CLASSIC progressive rock--songs that are 10 minutes long that contain lots of musical obligatos (generally keyboard, but not to the level of YES, Genesis, ELP, etc; the sax player makes this sound unique from those icons), and lyrics that appraoch 'poetry' status in their own right, and that invite your intellect to listen again (and again).  Like all music of this genre, it is meant to be listened to actively rather than passively [Honestly, has anyone ever put Foxtrot (Genesis), Close to the Edge (Yes), In the Court of the Crimson King (King Crimson), or Tarkus (ELP) on as BACKGROUND music?  No.  It DEMANDS that you get involved.  Each time you play it, it is an event--yet the effort is made willingly!]  <br /> <br />Needless to say, a fine $1 purchase back then, but this remastered work finally took away the pops and crackles I became accustomed to.  I agree with those who say this album marks the hieght of VDGG's career.  Do not stop here though--owning the earlier releases of Aerosol Grey Machine (good luck finding it), H to HE, and The Least We Can Do... are mandatory.  Post-1975 stuff is different, and I'll allow you to seek other advice on those recordings (I don't care for them).   <br /> <br />As forPawn Hearts, you may even recognize THEME 1, which was used for a couple TV spots back in the day--similar to a few Tangerine Dream themes.  I can't recall now what it was associated with, but I remember knowing it instantly back then.  I seem to think it was sports-related, like an NFL theme or something.  Ah well.  Enjoy the hell out of this important work in music history.  Yes, I think it rises to this level.  Fripp bought into it, after all! :-) <br />
B000AOJ9X0|2.0|Other than John Lee Hooker's efforts that combine superstar guest artists; there are very few CDs that successfully make this combination work.  And Buddy Guy's effort isn't one of them.  The duets or combination songs just simply fall flat and are strangely uninspiring.  Give this one a miss and save your money.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Easily one of Daron Malakian's best lyrics on an album packed with memorable, quotable sentiments and images. The incredible title track is one of System's best songs ever and confirms what longtime fans have known for a decade, SOAD is one of the most innovative, musically accomplished and genuinely brilliant bands of the 21st century. Everything on \\"Hypnotize\\" works, from the thrashing, warp speed rockers, to the longer (for this band anyway) tracks, most notably the excellent \\"Holy Mountains\\". My biggest relief; the fact that the band hasn't lost its sense of humor, songs like the shapeshifting \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" and the herky-jerky \\"She's Like Heroin\\" are two of my favorites, in short, I'm glad these guys are still weird and proud of it. This LP is a very intense, 40 minute scream that almost never lets up, but leaves the listener both exhilarated and exhausted.
0060751967|5.0|I picked up this book expecting a fluffy/vampire-hottie/kissing book. Well, there is kissing and a hot vampire, but there is much more.   <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed this book and was surprised at the great plot and great writing.  I look forward to Ms. Sparks next offering.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|Thankfully I saw this movie on cable and didn't pay to see it. The movie is just boring and it's not that funny. There are funny parts through the movie but not enough for it to pass off as a comedy, there also isn't one laugh out moment through the whole movie. Also I really dislike the british accents and their sense of humor is just boring and sometimes confusing. So if you're into british comedies then I'm sure you'll love this movie and you should buy it, but if british comedy isn't your thing then don't even bother with this movie.
B000002AH7|2.0|I've had this for a few years now.  After the mandatory three listens once I acquired it, I put it back on the shelf to try again at a later time.  Like other music that doesn't initially take, I play it every six months or so, giving it another go, wondering if maybe this is the time when it'll sink in, waiting for that \\"A-ha!\\" moment.  Sometimes, like John McLaughlin's \\"Electric Guitarist\\", it eventually comes.  Other times, though, you just have to finally accept the fact that not every album will find a place in the heart of every listener.    I'm certainly not the biggest Miles fan in the world.  I have some of his albums, but I don't feel the completist's need with him the way I do with some other artists.  \\"'Round About Midnight\\" is my favorite by far, \\"Kind of Blue\\" (of course) and \\"Milestones\\" are both excellent, and I especially love his playing on Cannonball Adderley's  \\"Somethin' Else\\".  I'd heard plenty of good things about \\"Sketches of Spain\\", a friend of mine even said it's his father's favorite album, and since I enjoyed the other Miles music I owned it seemed like a riskless purhase.    I'm stunned by the lack of melody.  I'm not asking to tap my toes or find myself humming the music when I'm by myself in the elevator, but I expect SOMETHING to be memorable.  It doesn't speak well of an album when I can't remember a single note in context moments after I put it away.   If there was any motivation to Miles's playing here, then it got lost somewhere between his head and his lips and fingers.  And there's virtually no synergy between the orchestra and Miles.  They sound more like they're going through the motions of making a sad mood piece than trying to create something inspired.  I realize what they're trying to do, but I'm simply not feeling it.  I've never heard the original Concierto de Aranjuez, but if it's anything like the version here I don't feel the need to seek it out.    I'm not going to stop getting Miles's albums.  I'm just going to be alittle more wary about making a blind purchase.    Judging by the number of positive reviews here, I know I'm in the minority on this one.  Much like Picasso, Tolstoy or Fellini's works, I can appreciate that there's something in the art that appeals to a great many people, but that appreciation doesn't always translate to a liking.      Find someone who has a copy of \\"Sketches of Spain\\" and listen to it first before picking it up yourself.
B00005B36H|1.0|The only good songs are the grudge and schism and the rest are slow, boring and forgetable.
B00005UQ9F|2.0|I was surprised by all of the excellent reviews of this movie.  Personally, I watch movies to be entertained and as a form of escape, not to have to interpret dreams and delusions in some vain attenpt to figure out what the characters are meaning or experiencing through their bizarre and undecipherable mind trips.   <br /> <br />I found the plot scattered, the music annoying, and the end totally worthless.  Not enough information was given to the standard movie-goer to fully understand what was happening with the characters, and unless you are a psychotherapist yourself you would probably have a great deal of trouble figuring out what the heck is going on.  <br /> <br />I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with most of you.  I didn't like this one at all and I can't recommend it.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Ten and Vs. are two of my all-time favorite albums. The passion and emotion that run throughout both of these records are unparalleled by any other Pearl Jam release. But No Code is the record that makes this band legendary and timeless. There are few bands that would have the stones to release an album like this at the peak of their commercial success. While the raw angst and emotion of Ten will never be duplicated, No Code stands as a far more mature and dynamic record. Unfortunately, many fans did not follow on this journey.  <br />When this album first came out, it seemed as though Pearl Jam had fallen off from what made them great. There are no 'Jeremy', 'Alive', \\"Daughter', 'Betterman', 'Dissident' type of songs on this record. But this is also what sets No Code apart from other Pearl Jam albums. You will never be bogged down by overplayed radio singles. No Code stands as a unique experimental masterpiece that very few bands are able to accomplish.  <br />While Ten and Vs. are probably my favorites, this album may be their most timeless. 'Off he goes', 'Who you are', 'In my tree', 'present tense', 'smile', and 'red misquito' are all songs that stand apart from songs on other Pearl Jam releases. It is through these unique qualities that this album becomes very difficult to compare to their other releases.  <br />The more you listen to this album, the more it will grow on you (more so than any other Pearl Jam record). For anyone who quit listening to Pearl Jam after Vs. because they changed their sound, take a look at No Code. The change was worth it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This film is incredible. I can't wait to own it on DVD. The story, acting, music,costunes, scenery/location . . . This movie brings back the art and power of cinema and how stories move us.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the best album I have listened to in all my years. It all comes down to experience or exposure i guess. You cannot judge art if you are not an artist or at least have some knowledge or appreciation about the subject. The same applies to music. Now it may be true that not all of us know what 'contrapoint' means but some of us have listened to music, and then I don't mean 'baby hit me between the legs one more time'.  <br /> <br />This is plainly speaking, music for audiophiles. Such a mature, cohesive and introspective work of genius is hard to find. Just make sure you take your daily vitamins and get enough sunlight. Music has on this album become a medium for social commentary about Liberal democratic Westernised culture ( the downward spiral of the autonomous self) - a function of art... And what art it is! <br /> <br />- Pieter van der Merwe (pabjnr@yahoo.co.uk)
0920668372|5.0|First, I cant' believe people actually think this is creepy! It's harldy prose, half the book is poetry, and it should be treated as such. Where's your imagination and sentiment?? I just read this for the first time last week while I was babysitting. A four-year-old asked me to read it to her. It was one of her favorites, I could tell before I even began reading. Well, I couldn't read the book without stopping because I had to keep regaining control over my shaking voice and wiping the tears from my eyes!! It's a beautiful representation of a mother's love. My only regret is that I didn't come across it earlier. Don't mind the faint-hearted reviewers - go pick up a copy!
0975991477|1.0|I was wary about reading this book after checking out Bruce Lipton's website and my instincts were quickly confirmed in the preface where he lists Yanni as one of his great inspirations. Another scientist-cum-guru. I'd reached my limit with Candace Pert, whom Lipton cites briefly but favorably. Like Pert, he claims to have gained an important insight into life or the human condition or whatever through his research, then having had to leave traditional science when his pronouncements became too heretical. It looks to me more like stretching the conclusions too far beyond the data. Lipton's two papers of 1991 and 1992 show that immortalized endothelial cells take on different phenotypes in the culture dish when grown in different conditions. Hardly surprising now, but from this he gets an epiphany that DNA does not control every characteristic manifested by a life form. Would anyone say otherwise nowadays? That's the problem with this book in a nutshell; he keeps claiming to have arrived at heretical paradigm-shifting ideas that in the end are either trivial (the membrane is the brain of the cell), scientifically (yet) unverifiable but unoriginal retreads of New Age standards (there is a vibrational energy that communicates between life forms), or fairly undisputable truisms (how you think can affect your physiology).  All this presented in the self-congratulatory context of telling his story of transition from academic scientist to proselytizer of the \\"New Biology\\" in a traveling road show. First of all, to still call yourself a cellular biologist 13 years after your last paper was published takes some chutzpah in my book. Secondly, this is more a story of a man with a mess of a life finding peace and happiness outside of the rat race. Fine, but his telling of the story is embarrassing at times. And he states some howlers regarding what \\"science\\" thinks (as if it's a monolithic institution) such as, \\"it is only in recent years that scientists have realized the importance of the membrane's IMPs (integral membrane proteins).\\" The whole long history of the field of pharmacology was \\"realizing the importance of IMPs,\\" figuring out how the membrane actually does what it does. I, like almost every other biologist I know, have spent my whole career in science studying in some form membrane proteins and how they transduce input from the external environment into intracellular \\"awareness.\\" And his whole \\"DNA is not paramount\\" schtick is knocking down a straw man. To refer to \\"scientists\\" as genetic determinists and social Darwinists, believing that genes direct everything with no regard to the environment, is cartoonishly simplistic. Overall, I feel a little guilty criticizing an enthusiastic and energetic purveyor of quite positive and optimistic ideas about the human condition, none of which I have any problem with at heart. But I've heard or read all of these ideas elsewhere, much better presented. He did provide good references, some of which I was not aware, and if any readers are first exposed to these ideas here, than more power to him.tance of the membrane's IMPs (integral membrane proteins).\\" The whole long history of the field of pharmacology was \\"realizing the importance of IMPs,\\" figuring out how the membrane actually does what it does.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|Normally I try to avoid the hype machine that surrounds a band referenced or namechecked on \\"The OC\\" or some other blisteringly popular and annoying teen show. But something about the first single off Death Cab for Cutie's album \\"Plans\\" spoke to me in a way that nothing on the radio has in quite a while. So I picked up the album (keeping in mind that they were supposedly \\"Seth Cohen's favorite band\\" and not hold it against them). I can say I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I'm not going to pretend that I know the history of DCFC or their indie-rock roots. This is their major-label debut, and it's pleasantly against what you'd normally expect from a legendary cult band trying to achieve pop immortality on their very first major record. The album starts quietly, and ends quietly. In between, there are a lot of quiet songs.<br /><br />A snoozefest, right? Not so.<br /><br />The best tracks, besides \\"Soul Meets Body\\" are Summer Skin, I Will Follow You Into The Dark (an aching acoustic ballad that makes the listener weep), Crooked Teeth, What Sarah Said...really, the entire album lives up to the heady expectations that some will bring to it. It's not for everyone per se, but it has certainly had an effect on me.<br /><br />Again, I'm new to the whole DCFC mythology and mythios. But I know great music when I hear it, and you can't do much better than \\"Plans\\". Nevermind the hype, this is the real deal.
6305313687|5.0|we watched this movie in our english class while we discussed the topic \\"violence in society\\". even though it was quite shocking because of some brutal and violent scenes, we liked it. \\"american history x\\" has a really good message about the danger of joining a violent group like skinheads. the main character derek has undergone a quite impressing evolution. at first he is rather brutal and proud of the power he has over his family and right-winged friends. after coming back from prison, because of having killed two black guys, his attitude has changed all the way. now he is emberassed about his past and tries to convince his brother danny, who has become a member of the same group while derek was in prison, to think about the consequences of his racist actions. the end is a big surprise and quite sad. \\"american history x\\" was worth seeing it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Alright, I've heard of Green Day. Who hasn't, right? They've been around for a good long while. I've heard a few of their songs here and there but never picked up an album. I never buy an album unless I'm sure I'll like more than just the songs that hit the radio stations. But, this album was different. I heard all the singles for \\"Blvd of Broken Dreams\\", \\"American Idiot\\", and my personal favortite \\"Holiday\\". So I thought I'd pick up the album. I actually got it for Christmas and it is just incredible. I am now considering picking up their older albums. This really is an amazing piece of work. Every single song is amazing and just makes you want to jump up and chant right along with them. Good job, guys. Well done indeed.
B000002HMH|5.0|The songs on the load and Reload era are one that made Metallica into what it is now, the best band of all time. The reason people will not like this album is because its not thrash. Thats really sad because 20 years from now when teens are listening to metallica they will respect these album more than our generation ever did. Metallica takes time to grow on you it just that no one wants to take that chance. Epic crash down like in songs like Bleeding Me and Hero of the Day are what shine in this album. <br /> <br />Songs that shine the most <br /> <br />Aint My Bitch <br />Two by Four <br />The house that jack built <br />King Nothing <br />Bleeding Me <br />Hero of the day <br />Until it sleeps <br />Ronnie <br />Mama said <br /> <br />A true critic will actually listen to the music before posting a review.

0670914665|5.0|\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is a classic children's book. First published in 1964, the book was re-issued in a special \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\" in 2004. This review refers to both the book in general and to the special edition.    Charlie is a poor boy living in a small run-down house with his mother and father and his four grandparents. The four grandparents are so old and frail that they spend all their time lying in one large bed. The family is so poor that they don't have enough to eat, and then Charlie's father loses his job, and the family begins to starve.    This is a story for children?    Not far from the house in which Charlie lives is a huge chocolate factory owned by Mr. Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka is a master at inventing new kinds of candy and chewing gum and other sweets. His factory is manned not by human workers but by small Oompa-Loompas, miniature people who work hard and love to sing.    Willy Wonka's amazing factory is closed to the public, but Charlie and four other children (and their parents) get to visit the factory one day. The other four children have various behavioral problems, and they all, one by one, get their comeuppance. Willy Wonka blithely comments that they just got what they deserved, and the Oompa-Loompas sing an amusing song for each of the four children to mark their departure from the tour of the factory!    Do naughty children really deserve such serious consequences?    Children seem to think so. They love the story and they love the quirky and strange Mr. Willy Wonka and his fantastic inventions and they delight in the songs of the Oompa-Loompas and the beguiling illustrations. So who am I, a mere adult, to argue?    So five stars for the book, based on it being a children's book that children love.    The book has been filmed twice, in 1971 with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, and in 2005 with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. I've never seen the 1971 movie. The 2005 movie is great, but it should be noted that Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka is a somewhat different and much more developed character than the simpler Willy Wonka of the book.    And finally, a few comments about the \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\". As far as I can determine, all that is special about this special edition is that it is hardcover and that it has a very nice dust jacket with a bit of gold printing on it. Frankly, I'm disappointed that when they advertise a book as being a \\"Special 40th Anniversary Edition\\" that the contents have not been made special in some way.    Rennie Petersen
B00001QEFU|3.0|I was fortunate enough to buy the original Secret Records release on vinyl as an import from Italy back in the 80s and I am so happy that I still have it because I really don't like what was done to this album in the remastering process.  All of the raw intensity has been stripped away in favor of way too much reverb on the drums and vocals, ostensibly to \\"clean up\\" the sound.  UTB was not a clean-sounding album to begin with and that was part of why it succeeded so well.  Sadly, this happens with way too many remasters -- reverb effects or drum triggers that did not exist in the original production are added supposedly to modernize the production and, in every case where this is done, it detracts from what made the album so great so many years ago.  I don't know if a CD has ever been released with the original mixes of these tunes, so you may have no choice but to hear it only in its remastered form.  Fortunately the tunes are great and, if you've never heard what the original mix sounded like, you won't know what you're missing anyway so definitely buy it on the strength of the tunes.  Me...I'll stick to my vinyl copy thank you very much.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This album is a refreshing reminder that Madonna still knows how to make a great CD... After the Preachy \\"American Life\\" and less than Exciting \\"Music\\"... \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a good fun return to what made Madonna great in the first place. <br /> <br />Now all the pre-release Hype made promises the album didn't keep... We were promised No Messages, No Kabbalah, No Ballads... <br />well, we didn't get any Ballads.. but not all the songs are really what I'd call \\"Dance\\" Songs...  <br />BUT there are Messages and Kabbalah... Let it Will Be & How High - in which Madonna laments YET AGAIN about the trials and tribulations of fame... Isaac - even though it isn't about that Rabi everyone thought it was about, it is still laden with Kabbalah.  <br />The Good News is the rest of the album is Catchy.. even the Message Ridden Kabbalah Songs... it's almost a guilty pleasure to enjoy when Madonna climaxes Let It Will Be declaring \\"JUST WATCH ME BURN!\\" and How High's electronica feel... <br /> <br />The Highlights in the album are HUNG UP, which grows on you fast as the song on the album with the most commercial potential; SORRY which has the very addictive line \\"I've heard it all before\\"; GET TOGETHER which is reminiscent of her classic Holiday; LET IT WILL BE ... JUST WATCH ME BURN; PUSH is a very different feel for Madonna, and it's very high energy and very addictive; and JUMP which has a very neo-disco feel to it. <br />The Songs to skip: Future Lovers- Mirwais takes his last breath as he makes one of the more boring songs on the album; I Love New York - \\"Other places make me feel like a Dork\\" is really gonna keep you from enjoying this song.. but it's actually kinda catchy if you can get past Madonna's brain-fart lyrics on this one; Isaac - I'm tired of Madonna obsessing over Kabbalah in her music. I don't care if she's a Kabbalist or not.. hurah for her.. but jesus woman... don't you think you've preached about it enough? <br />This album is not as good as some of her classics like \\"LIKE A PRAYER\\" or \\"RAY OF LIGHT\\" but it is definately one of the better ones.
B000002ITK|5.0|People, the name of the CD is \\"big Hits and Nasty Cuts\\", not \\"Twisted Sister's Greatest Hits and Nothing else.\\"  As a loooooong time Ts fan, I love the fact that this CD represents the full picture of the band.  Sure, they had some huge hits in the hayday of hair metal, but in the late 70s and early 80s, they were one of the most vicious live acts around in terms of their intensity.  the live tracks recorded at the Marquee Club in London show just how intense they were before their radio-friendly hits were recorded.  I think the name of the CD says it all and no one should be surprised at what they are getting when they buy it.  The Cd has equal helpings of their most well-known hits, as well as just enough early live stuff to show you what they sounded like before they were the darlings of MTV.
B000CPGZHA|3.0|I love Kylie... but the girl just doesn't know how to put on a show. She's got some great videos (Come Into My World, Red Blooded Woman, Did it Again), and some Classic Hits.. (Can't Get You Out of My Head, Locomotion, On a Night Like This)... but she just can't do THE ULTIMATE Show... <br /> BRIEF REVIEW: <br />-I hated the costumes.. especially the first one, that showgirl look just wasn't it for her.... loose the plumes you look like a broke-down peacock.. The costume for \\"SLOW\\" was alright. But I swear I think I saw some of the same costumes in the FEVER tour.. especially on the back up dancers in SHOCKED. <br />-Some GREAT Performances of \\"I BELIEVE IN YOU\\" \\"DREAMS\\" \\"RED BLOODED WOMAN\\" \\"I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY\\"  <br />-Choreography Sucks, but that's nothing new for Kylie... But she actually danced during \\"CONFIDE IN ME\\" which shocked me.. and I enjoyed that part. <br />-Poor Performances of \\"GIVING YOU UP\\" \\"COME INTO MY WORLD\\" \\"ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS\\" and \\"OVER THE RAINBOW\\" <br />- KYLIE, better than Madonna or Cher.. knows how to make an entrance.. but just like Cher (and unlike Madonna)... Kylie doesn't know how to follow it up. She just stands there...  <br />-Some of the songs are really emotional to you... or at least to me when you sit there and think \\"This woman has breast cancer, and she's still out there doing it.\\" Granted it was just before she went into treatment.. but the cancer is still there. <br />- Costuming on the Guys is HOT, especially in RBW. <br />-GREAT Setlist. <br />-Sings Live, which is always a plus.. even if you don't have a great voice.. we'd rather hear what you have to offer than a lifeless show that was entirely pre-recorded. (Did you hear that Britney?) <br />- In Some Respects it's better than FEVER.. which in my opinion was her best concert... but is other respects it's closer to an over-produced nameless anyone pop concert...  <br />-A Fun show for a Kylie Fan.. but not the casual Kylie listener... she might make an entrance.. butthe overall show does not hold you like Our Lady of Concerts does.. (Madonna). So if you're just looking for a good concert.. This isn't your best pick.. but if you're a Kylie Fan, you'll love this.
0060516402|5.0|A visionary company, say the authors, is one that is the premier organization in its field, one that has had a long standing impact on the world, and has had an average stock-return performance of fifteen times the general market since 1926.  The authors of Built to Last spent six years studying visionary companies in-depth to uncover the underlying factors that helped them to outperform the competition.  They first polled hundreds of CEO's to find out what companies they most esteemed.  They then chose eighteen to profile in-depth and also researched a competitor to compare them with.   <br /> <br />Here are some of their findings about visionary companies: <br /> Visionary company founders take an architectural approach to building their firms.  They concentrate on the company's processes, systems and values, not their products.  They also develop their managers and employees, so that the company survives long after the visionary leader is gone. <br /> Ideals and core ideologies drive visionary companies, not profits alone.  Visionary companies have basic precepts that say, \\"This is who we are;  this is what we stand for;  this is what we're all about.\\" <br /> Visionary companies commit to Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAG's), that serve as unifying focal points for development.  These goals should be clear and compelling, involve risk, be consistent with the core ideology of the company, and be so bold and exciting that progress will continue even if leaders leave before the goal is achieved.   <br /> Visionary companies have cult-like cultures.  They are great places for people to work, if the people \\"fit\\" into the company culture and ideology. <br /> Visionary companies use home-grown management.  Of the eighteen companies studies, only four times did one of them go outside of the firm for a CEO.
0446577383|1.0|This was my first David Baldacci book and it will be my last. I have read hundreds of novels and never before read a more hate filled book towards the United States. This book makes Michael Moore and Ted Kennedy sound conservative. If you are one who believes that George Bush went to war in Iraq to boost the stock price of Halliburton this book is for you. If you think the USA is evil and we just need to understand the plight of terrorists you will love reading this trash. I want my money back!
B00005JOFO|5.0|Dear Mikey, You should probably get out of west hollywood for a while. If sex scenes are all you want, stick with porn. The rest of us can appreciate a love story between two men at a time when it wasnt acceptable, much less tolerated. The understated relationship between these guys is what makes the film so good....it says a lot without saying a lot. I loved it and will see it again.

B0000025D0|5.0|\\"Born To Run\\" cast Bruce into the rock and roll spotlight. But \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\" found him retreating into the shadows to face his demons. This is probably the most soul searching and gut wrenching of all the Springsteen albums.     The songwriting is consistently excellent as an older and more mature Bruce begins to face the trials of adulthood. He establishes himself as a voice for the working class on songs like \\"Factory\\" and \\"Badlands\\" - \\"workin' in the fields till you get your back burned\\". He explores the painful and estranged relationship with his father on \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\" - \\"you inherit the sins, you inherit the flames\\". While \\"Racing In The Streets\\" and \\"The Promised Land\\" find him seeking out glimmers of hope amid all the despair -\\"we're gonna ride to the sea and wash these sins off our hands\\". The E Street Band's music is better than ever, with \\"Born To Run\\"'s \\"Wall of Sound\\" production being replaced by a more minimalist style, with each individual instrument being heard more clearly. I especially enjoyed Roy Bittan's piano playing and Max Weinberg's drumming.    Intense, haunting and yet hopeful \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\" clearly ranks among the very best of Springsteen's work. \\"Born To Run\\" is his all time classic. But I think this album may be my personal favorite
B000003CMB|5.0|The Allman Brothers band. Woooo Weeeee. This is some amazing jamming and good god damned rock! Southern Rock to be exact. Allman Brothers came around just about a year earlier, and had released two studio albums previous to this one. It was a period of time, I understand, when new ideas were very much accepted in the world. Especially when it came to rock and roll, however, since so many people were trying \\"new\\" stuff, it was easy for many bands to get overlooked. Even though, Duane Allman was a respected session player both in the US and the UK, when he got his brother and a few of his hometown friends out to tour, they weren't hardly recognized. That was until they TORE THE ROOF OFF at the FILLMORE EAST. The album recorded here put The ALLMAN BROTHERS into the spotlight where they belonged. They added a southern country, and much more blues oriented sound to the JAM scene that had all of those Grateful Dead hippies going nuts at the time. This stuff, was no psychedelic business at all though. This stuff was strait up ROCKIN! The first song STATESBORO BLUES will get you groovin' good... if you ain't gonna, then I know your SISTER will! The last song borders on Metal, with that heavy bass drive and killer guitar solos. ELIZABETH REED is an incredible instrumental jam, probably the one that opened my ears to extended style jams in the first place.. it starts off slow and jazzy but it WICKED ROCKS by the end. Allman Brothers were showing up the good stuff, and what was about to start coming from the south... NOT COUNTRY.... SOUTHERN ROCK!  Drink some Jack or So-Co, get down with this absolute live class act. Get into something truly AMAZING! You won't regret it.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|I like to consider myself open to all kinds of horror films.  I don't care if they're cheaply made, badly acted, or not well thought out, as long as they do one of two things: either make me jump a couple times, or at least have some good gore.<br /><br />Dahlia Williams is moving into an apartment with her daughter on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia is going through a divorce (backstory) and is under a lot of stress due to her current situation.  The apartment seems nice at first, until she notices a leak in the bedroom.  From that point, the movie never seems to have any focus.  Are we supposed to be worrying about the leak? the imaginary friend? the obnoxious tenants of the building? Dahlia's divorce?  It's never made clear until the end, when we get the classic revelation of what happened in the apartment upstairs, and why it's affecting Dahlia.<br /><br />Dark Water cannot be considered a horror movie.  The only reason it falls into that category is because the storyline involves a ghost.  There are no scares in this movie.  There are no scary moments.  There is no tension, whatsoever.  Quite simply, this is one of the worst, most disappointing \\"horror\\" movies that I have ever seen.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|The Butterfly Effect is a movie that frustrated me from begining to end. At the beginging we see the childhood of Evan, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny, where Evan has occasional blackouts during certain tramatic times. Now this early stuff isn't particularly good, but it gets much worse. <br /> <br />Evan, played as an adult by Kutchor, finds out he can go back to those certain blackout events and change events by reading his journal. Now the fact that they spend almost no time explaining how he does this doesn't bother me near as much as the obsurdity of the time changing outcomes. This movie is so over the top with every single major transition and almost always seems phoney. There's one decent performance by Amy Stuart who plays the adult Kayleigh, and love interest of Evan, but every other character is lined with overacting gibberish. Kutchor was definetly not the right person to play a psychotic, but to be fair the material is so dead that the best of actors couldn't save it.  <br /> <br />I really try to think about what other people who like this film are seeing, but the only positive thing I can really say about it is it kept my attension throughout, though it did so in a way that often made me squirm. It's not a bad movie I laughed at, it's just a bad movie. I wanted to stay for the ending, but that was ultimately as stupid as anything else the film had to offer. If this movie becomes a $5 bargin bin one than I'd say still avoid it.
B000957O82|4.0|Hitch was a movie I wanted to see in theaters but I was so positive it'd be just another date movie that I didn't even bother, I was given the movie the other day though so I was eager to see if it was worth the wait. I can safely say it was worth seeing, through the entire film there was consistent laughter despite the cliche pattern it followed (boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back). Eva Mendes was excellent in her role injecting the appropriate amount of humor and snootiness. But the two people who stole the movie completely were Will Smith and Kevin James. Kevin James is always hilarious but when paired up with the equally hilarious Will Smith, well that's just cinematic magic.<br /><br />The basic plot follows Alex Hitchens, the 'date doctor', as he deals with his personal life and helps Albert win over his dream girl. However bland that may sound, the jokes along the way help the pace of the film greatly.<br /><br />You can say what you will about this type of movie but it's no doubt that Will Smith can make anything watchable. He exudes such personality that its hard to not like him. As for Kevin James, he's just funny as heck, he reminds me of a little tamer version of Chris Farley. The women in this film hold their ground surprisingly well, Eva Mendes is pretty funny and Amber Valetta shows real potential. This movie does have it's slow parts though. When Will is hung over from the allergy medication and Eva is talking to him, I thought that scene kind of drug on a little long. Then after Eva prints the article about Will, that was a bit slow as well, but each scene bounced back nicely. So when all is said and done if you can handle some pretty cliche movie moments, this movie is well worth seeing.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|This album is one of the best albums around at the moment. The songs are very meaningfull.

B00092QUQC|5.0|What A great CD! No Filler, Just Killer. I've Thought this band was great since 1994, But they get No respect, at least here in the states. I know if the CD's were more available and cheaper here they would be all over the place selling out concerts and CD's. Anyway, get this CD if you like melodic, catchy, and smart hard rock. This is one of the few import CD's that's worth it for the price, and then you'll be hooked on getting there back catalogue.
0393327655|4.0|I can just imagine your typical Bible or Koran-thumper's eyelashes burning as they read this book. That is, if anybody of said persuasion would actually even glance at this book. <br /> <br />The author's pungent attack of religious unreason is exemplary and brave, while his conclusions are sobering, and frankly, depressing. <br /> <br />One reservation I have is that on the last chapter or two he takes a sharp left turn and goes New Age on us. I failed to understand exactly what he bases his beliefs on, and it only makes you wonder why in this section he seems to be suspending much of the same reasonability standards that he had been championing up to that point. He actually addresses this in a newly added afterword. Furthermore, I've since read an interview of him in which the interviewer calls him on this very point, but yet once again failed to make a case for his stance, in my opinion. Hence the 4 stars. <br /> <br />Still, I think this is a very relevant and outstanding work. <br />
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This korean masterpiece is a MUST SEE! This film has a great story line, great music, and chorigraphy. My favorite scenes were the awesome street fights. This might not be a martial arts movie but it has many aspects of \\"Martial Arts\\" in it. Once anyone sees this film, they'll have to buy it. This film beats any other \\"TARTAN ASIA\\" has possibly made. May all who see this movie, also see the beauty of Martial Arts which is present in this awesome film!!!
B00028HBKM|2.0|The Passion of The Christ, dealing with the last days of Jesus's life, is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus, laughing at his pain, mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent, but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable, and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it.
0679720200|4.0|I read with amusement the reviews of this novella.  One fellow was uncomfortable with this story and gave it 4 stars though he said he hated it.  I believe Camus would be pleased.  Others said the story stayed with them long after finishing the book.  Exactly.  This is philosophy--not a murder mystery.             The sheer economy of Camus' writing, the short, clipped sentence structure, and simple reliance on creating a setting to present a story reminded me of of a mythical cross between Hemingway and Poe.  This story is not meant to be uplifting.  It is been meant to make one consider the purpose of existence (existentialism).  As for those who believe Camus was pessimistic about the purpose of human existence, read \\"The Plague\\".  Read \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\".  Camus loved life and provides us all with a way to examine our purpose in a very simple and pure way.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|When I bought the Pirates of the Caribbean DVD despite not having seen it, I feared disappointment despite the recommendations of friends. Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />The score by relative unknown Klaus Bedelt complements the movie's action almost to perfection. It does seem to have borrowed a bit from Zimmer's score for 'Gladiator', but has its own spectacular moments, including 'The Medallion Calls' as pirate Capt. Sparrow sails his near-sunken boat into a British port from atop a mast, and 'To The Pirates' Cave!' when Elizabeth escapes from the wily Barbossa into the hands of a living-dead crew of skeletons that man the Black Pearl.<br /><br />This is a score that will make a great addition to the collection of anyone who loves movie soundtracks.
B00000K31Q|5.0|\\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" totally overwhelmed me, I was expecting a lackluster teen romance, what I got was a re-working of William Shakespeare's \\"The Taming Of The Shrew\\" to modern perfection. This movie is amazing and boasts some huge stars: Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gabrielle Union. The movie is actually really believable.<br /><br />The characters are well-played and crafted, the performances are superb. The script is witty and inventive. The soundtrack has some great songs but most of all the experience of watching this movie stays with you. My favourite characters would have to be Katarina (Julia Stiles) and Chastity (Gabrielle Union). The movie draws you in and you will find yourself watching it many times. It's probably good to buy a back-up copy as well, in case you wear out the first, in fact buy a third, just to be safe!!
B000063UR2|4.0|When I was little, there were only two movies that scared me: Jaws, and Legend.<br />This is one of the most hauntingly eerie fantasy movies I have ever seen. The plot revolves around a young Princess named Lily (Mia Sara) and Jack(a very young Tom Cruise), a wild boy who lives in the magical forest she visits.<br />The peaceful frolicking of there child-like love affair is soon shattered when the Lord of Darkness uses Lily (unwillingly) to slay one of the last living Unicorns (the mystical and beautiful creatures who keep the world filled with light and goodness).<br />What follows thereafter is both dizzyingly luscious and nightmarishly gothic.<br />The Lord of Darkness brings Lily into his world and is set on making her his demonic bride, while Jack fights to save her and the rest of the world, from being plunged into total darkness.<br />Ridley Scott is one talented director! This film is BEAUTIFUL to watch. While some people complain about the plot-line and some of the acting, this movie should be taken in more so as 80's fantasy art. The cinematography is exquisite. There are few movies that have captivated me so fully just with visuals as this film. It's amazing! The two disc feature gives viewers the option to watch the directors cut-which features added scenes and the original score by Jerry Goldsmith. I honestly prefer the Tangerine Dream soundtrack over the Goldsmith one by far because it is more creepy and beautiful. The Goldsmith score is more orchestrated and less dramatic in my opinion. Legend is an adult fairy tale that shimmers, glimmers and mystifies the mind. The twinkling world that dances on the screen is so vivid and fantastic that you can barely take your eyes from it. Anyways, this film is a classic in my opinion. It may not be the best movie ever made-but it was visually groundbreaking for it's decade.
B00080ZG10|5.0|The Aviator is a great biopic of offcentered aviation pioneer Howard Hughs. From his compulsive behavior and ecentrities, to his falladering with women, to his imagination of what he wants to do next, this movie gives you all of this historic figure. Leonardo Dicaprio gives his best performance yet, and the cast including Cate Blanchet as Kathrine Hepburn and Kate Beckensale as Eva Gardner do a fabulous job. The period of the 1930's and 1940's are remarkably created. This is one of the best films of 2004.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This album is awesome.  John is such a great player and songwriter.  Anybody who wants to listen to a good blues fusion album should check out TRY!   <br /> <br />Remember folks, this is a live album - don't expect the sound quality to be top notch.  Just wait until the spring when his studio album 'Continuum' comes out so you can drool over the quality. <br /> <br />Best songs: Wait Until Tomorrow, Vultures, Another Kind of Green
B000E1YVZU|5.0|RENT from 1996 until now has not changed. The meaning of the story is untouchable, generations to come will love RENT. Jonathan Larson would be proud. RENT is the story of love, hope, faith, and being different. Each character brought their own vibe into this film, and as a person who absolutely loved RENT on stage, I love it just as much, if not more on film.
B000002KBU|5.0|Previously the only I had really known about Joni Mitchell was the fact that Counting Crows & Vanessa Carlton had covered one of her songs by the name of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" and she had written a song called \\"Both Sides Now\\", that was it, I had really never listened to any of her music and that's why I loved this album so much, because it sounded so innovative and beautiful. This album is regarded as her masterpiece, and so it should be, it's amazing, upon first listen you are immediately drawn in.<br /><br />Although only about 36 minutes in length, \\"Blue\\" is well worth the stress of hunting down and buying, most good record stores should have this album. The songs focus on an emotional, up-front approach with the lyrics and sparse, minimalistic instrumentation. Joni's voice is unlike anything I've heard before, it can be tender, deep, soft and loving yet it can be powerful and show and amazing range. Some suggest that her unique vocal texture is the fact that she has been smoking since she was nine.<br /><br />The album starts with the superb song, \\"All I Want\\". Joni's voice is really warm and welcoming and I love the crescendo's in this song. The instrumentation fits the song perfectly, without a doubt this song is the best song on the album.<br /><br />\\"My Old Man\\" sees Joni adopt a Tori Amos like approach to the song, even though this album was released at least 15 years before Tori's debut!! I love the lyrics and Joni's vocal range.<br /><br />\\"Little Green\\" is the oldest song on the album, written in 1967, this song is the most folk influenced song on the album, showing remnants of her early days. The next song, \\"Carey\\" still sounds fresh and innovative some 30 years after it was released. I like the vocal harmonies and imagery created with the lyrics.<br /><br />The title track is a stunning, hauntingly beautiful ballad that is sparse yet sounding like an epic. The piano is just so heavenly and played to perfection. \\"California\\" is basically an ode to California, nothing simpler!! Even though she is from Canada is seems like she is singing about her homeland. I love the guitars, again.<br /><br />The eerie, almost at times melancholic \\"This Flight Tonight\\" is another track that sounds so modern and has obviously stood the test time. Her confessional lyrics give us an insight into Joni herself. \\"River\\" at first sounds like a bizzare re-working of a Christmas carol, even though it is themed around the season of giving it isn't all \\"Joy to world.... fa la la la la\\" it's more of a self-analysis of herself than anything else, simply using a river as a symbol.<br /><br />\\"A Case Of You\\" has great lyrics and I really like the symbolism of Joni's love for someone being symbolised through alcohol, how she talks about drinking a case of someone, pure genius. \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" is a great way to end such a great album, with it's haunting piano opening you know it's going to be a great song. The way she talks about the past is great and clear.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a superb find for me and I am totally overwhelmed. Many people call it melancholy the whole way through but I differ, I hear lots of reconciliation and plenty of happiness. I now plan to explore Joni's music further, with expected purchases of \\"Court & Spark\\" and \\"The Hissing Of The Summer Lawns\\". I highly recommend this album to anyone wanting to hear some really good music and indulge in a true masterpiece.ornia, nothing simpler!!

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|If one were to watch a condensed version of P&P, this is the one to watch. If one is a newcomer to P&P this is the one to watch. If one has watched the A&E version nine million times, and may want something fresh(despite eight other adaptations out there), this is the one to watch!<br /><br />  Granted, I myself, am not an austere follower of Austin, but I have read enough of the novel, and seen the A&E version enough times, to know what it is supposed to be. Call me romantic(I am), call me an idealist(I am), but no matter what way you look at it, this is the probably the best theatrical (non-television) version we will ever get.<br /><br />  It holds true to the spirit of the book, and although there are a number of storyline omissions, and some missing characters, it keeps all the key scenes, and stays true to the characters.  Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet is spunky and refhesing and Matthew McFayden's portrayal of Mr. Darcy holds his own when compared to what is the considered the definitive portrayal of Mr. Darcy; Colin Firth. This coming from an avid Colin Firth fan as well. I love Colin Firth, and he will always be dear to my heart, but Matthew McFayden has earned a place next to him as well thanks to this movie. His Darcy is restrained, yet sexy, prideful and haughty, yet tender and kind of sensitive. He walks a very fine line, as only Firth has been able to walk before, and it is a delight to watch.<br /><br />  The other characters, such as Lydia(Played by the always marvelous Jena Malone) and Mrs. Bennet, were not quite as over-the-top annoying as some of the portrayals of them in past versions. The relationship between Mr. Bennet and Lizzie seemed much more clearly defined as well (though the scene where Mr. Bennet apologizes was out of character for him...). Although I did enjoy the A&E's Mr. Collins, this one seems more appropriate to the period, and much more believable. Judi Dench is simply wonderful, and is the definitive Lady Catherine (even though they changed some of the scenes from the book, her portrayal of the character itself was fantastic!).<br /><br />  The characters in this version seemed much more suited to the era then in the A&E versions, the contrast between the Bennet's finfancial state and the Upper Class(Darcy & Bingley), was much more obvious, which was nice. The characters know their places, and they act like it. The dances also come off as more real and natural, not so staged as in the A&E version.<br /><br />  If all else fails to entice you, the Scenery is to die for! The English Moors are so beautiful their worth seeing the film for that alone! The scene were Mr. Darcy comes out of the mist to meet Elizabeth has to be one of \\"The most geourgeous\\" in cinema history.<br /><br />  So my hope for you is this: That no matter how many times you've read the book, no matter how many film(Tv or movie) versions you've seen, you can appreciate this one as well and be able to drink in the scenery, the marvelous music, and the wonderful acting.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyough they changed some of the scenes from the book, her portrayal of the character itself was fantastic!).<br /><br />  The characters in this version seemed much more suited to the era then in the A&E versions, the contrast between the Bennet's finfancial state and the Upper Class(Darcy & Bingley), was much more obvious, which was nice.

0140143505|5.0|Thank goodness this book is so short, because I could not put it down until I had read every last word.  What a delightful little read, and how desperately I wanted to be a part of that book shop, and then Helene's little apartment.  Not to be missed.  Follow it up with the lovely film starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Having proven his ingenuity as the writer of The Truman Show, and writer-director of Gattaca and the under-appreciated Simone, Niccol is clearly striving for Strangelovian relevance here as he chronicles the rise and inevitable fall of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukrainian immigrant to America who makes his fortune selling every kind of ordnance he can get his amoral hands on. With a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) who's initially clueless about his hidden career, and a younger brother (Jared Leto) whose drug-addled sense of decency makes him an ill-chosen accomplice, Yuri traffics in death the way other salesman might push vacuum cleaners (he likes to say that alcohol and tobacco are deadlier products than his), but even he can't deny the sheer ruthlessness of the Liberian dictator (a scene-stealing Eamonn Walker) who purchases Orlov's \\"products\\" to expand his oppressive regime. Niccol's themes are even bigger than Yuri's arms deals, and he drives them home with a blunt-force lack of subtlety, but Cage gives the film the kind of insanely dark humor it needs to have.
B000002VQQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest debuts of all time, Patti Smith is a true legend, despite no RIAA certified albums and one charting single. She has shaped much of the female music we hear today, everyone from Alanis Morissette to PJ Harvey have obvious influences from her music and prescence in the industry.<br /><br />\\"Horses\\" released in 1975 saw the dawn of the angsty alternative female 'persona' and music scene. This album was widely praised for it's innovation and progression even though it was only a minor hit.<br /><br />\\"Horses\\" is a defined classic in every right, from the cover photo to the songs everything is unique and special.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Gloria\\", the best song on the album. The song is a rock track firstly but has gospel influences in the chorus with a choir chanting \\"Gloria\\". Patti's voice is really raw and pure, making the song that much more believeable.<br /><br />\\"Redondo Beach\\" is a reggae-ska influenced track that sounds similar to No Doubt's early work. I loved the synth arrangement, it really works wonders alongside Patti's beautiful voice.<br /><br />\\"Birdland\\" is the first of two tracks that run over nine minutes. To do that is potentially fatal to an album as it can easily bore a listener and is hard to right a song that long. This song has nothing boring about it and I found myself thoroughly enjoying it.<br /><br />\\"Free Money\\" starts with a lovely piano opening and continues in a vein of a mid-tempo ballad until... the chorus when it goes into pure rock. This track sound like a classic mosh-pit song.<br /><br />\\"Kimberly\\" is another beautiful track that has everything, Patti's beautiful voice, catchy guitar riffs and a beautiful subtle background synth. The song sounds a tiny bit like \\"Redondo Beach\\" with it's synth although it's much subtler here.<br /><br />\\"Break It Up\\" is a great anthem like song that has a lovely soaring lead guitar from Tom Verlaine of Television fame. I really love the hook in this song. It's one of my favourites and it contains some nice vocal textures from Patti.<br /><br />\\"Land\\" is the last of the two nine minute epics. In my opinion this one is far better than \\"Birdland\\". It's a mixture of spoken poetry and full blown rock. The guitar really is a feature of this song. Long, but well worth the listen.<br /><br />\\"Elegie\\" is a short haunting track with another guest guitarist, Allen Lanier of Blue Oyster Cult. It's a nice eerie track. Patti's voice is more subdued here, surprisingly.<br /><br />A bonus track on the re-issue is a live version of \\"My Generation\\" recorded live in 1976 at The Agora in Cleveland, Ohio. This song rocks the live feel is one of immense energy and stage presence I would love to see video footage of it. Patti's voice is so raw and bare here proving she sounds just as good live as she does on CD.<br /><br />Overall, this is an essential for any female music lover, this is the first emergence that women could compete in the rock and alternative music fields. Patti created, crafted this classic which many generations can now love and appreciate. I just hope the Hall Of Fame & GRAMMY borads realise her importance in the industry and recognise her talents.e of my favourites and it contains some nice vocal textures from Patti. <br /> <br />\\"Land\\" is the last of the two nine minute epics.

B000B8QF14|4.0|1st, to the reviewer below me, you are overreacting. Green Day are NOT retiring any time soon, they have announced the plans for the next album and BIAB is soley for their fans. Anyway, about the album...<br /><br /> Okay, the DVD has a lot of flaws but it's still worth your $15. I saw these guys with my dad and it was pretty awesome. They played a lot more songs at my concert than thge number of songs that Sam decided to put on this DVD(People who were there came on here and said that they played more songs than the ones featured on the DVD). At my concert, Billie even got people on stage to play guitar, bass, and drums, which was cool. Near the end of the show, Green Day played their own cover of We Are The Champions. After that, Billie walked to the end of the runaway and played the classic Time Of Your Life. I think Billie came up with some of those antics later in their touring, if not tell me otherwise. I'll list some of the flaws of this DVD.<br /><br />1. 1st of all, Sam could've put all the songs on the DVD.<br />2. It really makes me cringe whenever the screen switches to black and white. Especially since that whenever there's B&W there's some good light effects. What's even worse is that the best shots are in B&W, and whenver there actually is color, either it's a closeup on a players face, the camera is focused on the audience, if there is a good shot in color, there's a big glare on the screen, and whenever there's color, the camera is  flailing away in total chaos. But as the concert moves on, ther IS less B&W, I'll give it that.<br />3. The most obvious flaw is that after each song, we have to watch an interview of the guys. Don't get me wrong, the interviews are cool and it's cool to finally see what Billie, Mike, and Tre do before going on. But Sam could've separated them and give an option to watch them with the performance.<br />4. As I said in the color part, the camera has to go out of control whenever the music speeds up. Camera man, if you can hear me, we could care less if you're skilled with the camera(GASP).<br />5. Is it absolutely necessary that the camera angle switches every 3 seconds?! There's really no need for that!<br /><br /> Now that I have that out of my system, this is a must for any Green Day fan, they play songs from AI as well as some of their great classics like good old Long view, Basket Case, Brain Stew, Hitchin' A Ride, King For A day(Possibly my favorite song from GD just because I think it's funny and catchy, also, it's mixed with Green Day's own cover of Shout.), and the almighty Time Of Your Life. As always we get Billie's fun and mezmerizing antics like the hey-o! Which I personally can't help but sing along to. Anyway, don't let the bad parts of the DVD that I listed(and that other people listed)turn you off of this DVD. It's great and, like I said, worth your $15.s if you're skilled with the camera(GASP).  5. Is it absolutely necessary that the camera angle switches every 3 seconds?!

B00004U2EZ|5.0|. . . highly recommend this album. the songs are beautiful and the singers seem to carry over the emotions that the characters feel to the listener. AWESOME!
B00006J3T4|1.0|Seriously, the only good song here is Way Aye Man. The rest is just more 80's sounding crap...Extremely boring, but hey, it's Mark Knopfler.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|This movie is viewed on two separate levels: first, as a serial killer thriller and, second, as a psychological horror film. This movie achieves success in both areas, and is actually a really good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe. The one thing that I consistently say about this movie is that the NAME and Picture have caused many to never see this movie....  But, that is also one thing that is appealing about this flick<br /><br />The movie opens with two characters, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and nondescript young Joe-everyman Adam (Leigh Whannell), waking up in some dingy forgotten bathroom, chained to the walls with a dead body lying between them. Without completely running the storyline I will say that Saw definitely has some unique twists and clever fright scenes. Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere. The dank bathroom and the spooky interior settings make this movie very unsettling, while the more visceral horror works on a more psychological level.  Definitely a movie that I would watch in the dark....<br /><br />Despite any shortcomings that some may discuss, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience. The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.  If you want to watch a movie that makes you think while scaring the pants off you...watch this movie!
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is NOT my origninal review. My 1st review revealed that I hated this album, since it was not as good as Trent's last few records. 2nd said that I finally found it to be ok. I am now going to write my final review on Trent's latest album.<br /><br />With Teeth is no TDS, or The Fragile, but it's still a great record. I gave it some time to grow on me, and I found that I really enjoyed it. Trent isn't miserable or a drug or alchohol addict anymore; that has to be factored in when listening to this album. If you can understand that, then you can actually enjoy this album. I'd say that With Teeth is a \\"pop masterpiece\\", and one of the best albums of 2005. The songs are catchy, organic, and full of fun dance beats. Trent has said in interviews that, with his cleaner and more sober life, he has \\"never been this excited about making a record.\\" If you're a NIN fan. you'll probably like this album to an an extent, though you may like it a lot. It took a while to grow on me, but I have finally found it to be enjoyable and catchy. I guess that some people really do expect too much from an artist who once wrote songs around his misery and is now writing them with a better life and a more positive outlook on it...<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great record. I'm a big NIN fan, I own all of Trent's albums, and will probably buy whatever he puts out. Let's just hope we won't have to wait another 5 or 6 years for a next record (actually, I heard that he plans to release a new album in 2007 with some songs he wrote; awesome!). Moving on...<br /><br />These are scores of the songs based on my liking of them:<br /><br />ATLITW- 8/10<br /><br />You Know What You Are? (well, more like You Know What You F***ing Are)- 10/10<br /><br />The Collector- 10/10<br /><br />The Hand That Feeds- 9/10<br /><br />Love Is Not Enough- 7/10<br /><br />EDIETS- 10/10<br /><br />With Teeth- 8/10<br /><br />Only- 100/10<br /><br />Getting Smaller- 6.5/10<br /><br />Sunspots- 1000000/10 (definately the best off the album, and I think this is one of Trent's best songs)<br /><br />TLBTB- 9/10<br /><br />BYIT- 9/10<br /><br />RWIB- 10000/10 (the 2nd best off the album, and I think this is one of Trent's best songs as well)00000/10 (definately the best off the album, and I think this is one of Trent's best songs) <br /> <br />TLBTB- 9/10 <br /> <br />BYIT- 9/10 <br /> <br />RWIB- 10000/10 (the 2nd best off the album, and I think this is one of Trent's best songs as well) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd at their best.  It has it all.  The riffs, the genius lyrics, the steady flowing music.  I like both Roger Water's and David Gilmour's voice, but David's dominates here.  The lyrics explore many topics, it is just a great all-around album.  I can't think of anything else to say, for a better review, see mine on \\"The Wall\\".  You go Vera Lynn.
B00004Y6NP|2.0|The 1980's were a bad decade for music, and this album is a good example of why. I hope you like overly long, overly synth driven tunes that run out of inspiration shortly after they begin, because that's pretty much all you get. In fact, I can only think of two tunes worth salvaging here; Money for Nothing and the Man's Too Strong, which even then don't touch average works by great bands (the Beatles, the Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin, etc).<br /><br />A fine example of everything bad about this release is Why Worry, eight-plus minutes of boring...for one, you can barely hear it, but when you can it's fairly uninspired. The same can be said for the title track and especially the opener, So Far Away, which repeats the same line (not to mention measure) for about two minutes in the end, and the title track. I'd avoid it, but that's just me.
0307276902|1.0|Having lived with a daughter that became addicted to Meth (Ice) at 16 and now going through recovery for the second time with her....Having a wife that responded to this by turning to alcohol for 2 years.....having worked with abused and deprived children in the juvenile courts system for 4 years, I read this book with great interest. I was right at the end when I started hearing how the author, Mr Frey, had actually \\"exaggerated\\", \\"embellished\\" parts of this book. This truth immediately answered what my heart was telling me as I read the book; \\"this is bull crap\\", \\"there is no substance/depth to this writing\\". Every time the writer reached a major point....there was simply nothing there. This book is anti AA, anti Christian, anti God and has no redeemable value. At the end, he finds his sobriety in the power of self, by simply choosing not to drink. This thinking is so typical of the addict. They get off drugs/alcohol for a period of time, they no longer need help, can do it on their own so they leave the program....and then, be it 1 month or 15 years, they relapse...and the relapse is always harder and more destructive then the first go around. With this book of lies, James Frey, will do nothing but hinder true healing and give false hope for those struggling with this death he claims to have conquered. His demons will be back...with all their friends...to feast off his lies...and money. Buyers/readers, friends and family of addicts, give serious thought to recommending this book!!!
B00004RSA8|5.0|Twelve Monkeys is a sci-fi approach to the likely scenario that a deadly virus spreads rapidly, endangering mankind and threatening life on Earth.  The likelihood of such a phenomenon is presently great indeed (SARS, Bird Flu etc), and hopefully the film will get many people thinking.  <br />Apart from the \\"back from future\\" element, the movie is very realistic in its approach, and conveys a much needed message of the dangers facing the world, especially when dealing with viruses (i.e. how fast and easily many of them can spread).  Moreover, one realizes how helpless governments would be in stopping or preventing such a disaster if a virus fell into the wrong hands.  <br />Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, and Medeleine Stowe, whose performances are simply AMAZING, make this movie one of the best of its kind.  <br />The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.   <br />Resident Evil (Milla Jovovich) is another very good movie dealing with virus-related incidents/threats, though it falls much more under \\"Horror\\" than Twelve Monkeys, which is a more \\"Thriller/Action/Sci-Fi\\" type of film.  Another movie that comes to mind is Outbreak (Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman, Rene Rousseau), which probably provides the most realistic approach of the three to similar virus-related threats to humanity. <br />In short, Twelve Monkeys is a movie definitely worth watching (it's an eye opener) and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!   <br />
B00000K3D4|5.0|This strange and magical movie will set your spirit high. this was a very good movie. I enjoyed David Bowie's Performance and singing.

On the way she befriends a goblin, monster and a daring fox, and they all have to find their way through the Labyrinth maze. and if she don't make it in time she'll lose her baby brother to the Goblin King. So becarful what you wish for.<br /><br />If you liked the movie check out the soundtrack & Novel.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|In truth, I've only been exposed to ten or eleven of Elvis' 30+ records. Some are very good. Some are very bad. Still others are just okay. But This Year's Model beats 'em all, except possibly its sequel, Armed Forces.<br />The first thing you may notice about this album is the difference in bands. Clover, Costello's collaborators on My Aim Is True (his third-best), were just another bar band. Not the Attractions. The Attractions were an anaglam of punk, New Wave and a bit of funk (listen to Bruce Thomas' bass, and you'll know what I'm talking about). They're also far more fierce. They don't just rock, they rock with a vengeance. And everybody adds something important: Bruce and Pete Thomas give a strong, supple, funk-rock rhythm section; Steve Nieve, weird, sometimes cheesy keyboards. And Elvis of course gives the VENOM.<br />Then there's the songwriting, which is even sharper than it was first time out. The melodies are always strong, whether the song itself is great (the Beatles-like No Action; the cynical This Year's Girl, lightspeed Lipstick Vogue) or just okay (Little Triggers, Hand in Hand). But even the just-okay songs are listenable. And the lyrics. Remember how I talked about venom? It's all over the place. You've got your big, bad, funky anti-hendoist classic Pump It Up (with the ultimate shout-along chorus - arena-ready, but in a good way. And that bass solo!), the nervy, paranoid, very underrated Beat (which I think is my favorite on the album - I love the chorus and Neive's keyboards), the unforgivably nasty, take-no-prisoners attitude of This Year's Girl (Based on the Rolling Stones' Stupid Girl, which it manages to one-up in the anger department); the aforementioned Lipstick Vogue, which again spares nothing in putting down an ex-lover (\\"Sometimes I almost feel... just like a human being\\" - great, GREAT lyric), and my second-favorite, (I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea, where Costello unloads all his ire against vanity. And it's funky, with Elvis almost rapping over the tight groove. Love it. Oh, almost forgot the Spector-esque protest Radio, Radio. WHAT A SONG! While Costello was mad with everybody, he decided corrupt, payola-influenced DJ's would be another valid target. And while it's essentially whining, who can argue with the brutal lyric \\"They say you'd better listen to the voice of reason/but they don't give you a choice because they think that it's treason\\" (or something like that)? Love the video, too. I'm not the kind who sits around watching MTV or VH1 - I saw it at a Hard Rock Cafe - but it was amazing, just so unpretentiously fun - look at Steve Nieve in the background, totally making a fool of himself. (It's worth noting that, right afterwards, GN'R's pompous, unintentionally hilarious video for Estranged came on - no need to ask which one I prefered, I hope). More to the point though, that's a hell of a video.<br />And this is a hell of an album. Like My Aim is True and Armed Forces, it's all the Costello a beginner needs, along with a compilation of some kind.g over the tight groove. Love it.

0553801503|1.0|Oops.  Martin has Robert Jordan syndrome.  They lost their fans back in book 3.  These guys must love hearing themselves write.  Too bad the plot got lost in all the words, I was really hoping for more. <br /> <br />There are way too many details on secondary characters, and not enough broadening of the main characters (half of which aren't even present in the book).  It is too mentally exhausting to put forth enough effort to try and keep all of them straight in my head, because they add no value to the plot.  I know, I know, the story about the books split in two.  Bad idea. <br /> <br />Skip this book and you'll have missed nothing that advanced the story.  Let's hope for more with Book 4, A Dance With Dragons.

0440224764|3.0|Perhaps I am missing something, but it seems to me that aspects of the plot were not well thought through.  As we learn early on, Patrick has faked his own death and his wife Trudy has received a large insurance settlement.  One of the subplots consists in the idea that Trudy and her boyfriend, Lance, now have a motive for killing Patrick because then Trudy will not have to repay the money to the insurance company.  But I don't see how that makes any sense, because everyone knows now that Patrick is alive and, after all, no one has been paying the premiums on the insurance policy.<br /><br />There is also a scene where the father of one of the main characters is described as jogging \\"three hundred kilometers\\" in what is presumably several minutes (p. 279, hardcover ed.), a further sign that the author was asleep at the switch.<br /><br />This is a fun read while it lasts, but when you get to the end you feel it wasn't really worth it.
B000BP86OG|4.0|THE BAND: Justin Hawkins (lead vocals, lead guitar, piano/synth), Dan Hawkins (guitars, bells and triangles), Ed Graham (drums), Ritchie Edwards (bass guitar).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2005) 10 songs clocking in at approximately 35 minutes. Included is a super glossy 18-page booklet with band photos, song lyrics and thank you's. Recorded at Rockfield Studios, Gwent, UK. Great cover artwork by Mark Wilkinson. Two versions (with explicit or edited lyrics) available. Label - Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: No sophomore slump here with \\"One Way Ticket To Hell...\\" - this album absolutely rocks. A 4.5-star rating for two reasons: 1st - Way to short a disc. I thought the days were gone of Kiss and Van Halen albums that were filled with 9 or 10 three and a half minute songs, right? Not so. And 2nd - tracks 1-7 are downright fun, catchy, melodic, hard rocking pop songs... but tracks 8-9-10 fall off; not to mention to much of Hawkins' high pitched singing dominates these last 3 tunes. Song for song though, I like this album better than their debut, \\"Permission To Land\\" (2003). The Darkness bring back sweet memories for those of us growing up on 1980's rock and roll. Thoughts of big hair, lipstick and mascara, spandex or ripped blue jeans immediately come to mind. As do 80's bands with similar sounds - like Giant, Europe, Thunder, Krokus... and dare I say Dexy's Midnight Runners (due to a few of their Celtic influenced songs). The first hits to land on our local FM airwaves are \\"One Way Ticket\\" and \\"Hazel Eyes\\" with good reason - simply great songs with very catchy beats. The UK must be proud of The Darkness - I've read in 2005/2006 that they're selling out everywhere. The rockers make you want to crank the volume up, and the ballads (\\"Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time\\" and \\"Bling Man\\") are thought provoking. I wish more bands were playing music like this today. Great disc.
1594200106|5.0|With 3 kids, I'm particular when it comes to a book.  It will consume all my free-time and it, therefore, must be great.  This one was great!  From page one, I was hooked.  The Shadow of the Wind is a Spanish-type Usual Suspects.  It has twists and turns that will keep you enthralled.  I wish this author had more books translated into English for us to enjoy.
B00005JKYI|4.0|From the moment of the opening credits, one can't help but laugh at the fashion of the early eighties.  Did we really wear that stuff?  The hair, the clothes, and Hollywood's insistence of casting actors that were nearly in their thirties to play high school children.  The premise is just as goofy now as it was then--a town that forbids dancing and loud music--is a stretch, but the movie is just so much darn FUN.  The soundtrack is just as infectious now as it was back then and the over-zealousness of the church is just as prominent now as it was back then.  I still wonder how Kevin got into his jeans, and I'm amazed how much Sarah Jessica Parker has bloomed over the years.  Who would have thunk, huh?<br /><br />Overall this is a feel good film for those of us who grew up in the 80's.  An instant throwback to when were young and footloose.
B0000062FN|5.0|Contrary to most reviewers, I find this to be the most consistently engaging Santana album from their early period. I think the addition of Neal Schon on guitar (who was probably only 15 or 16 at the time) really helps keep this album fresh. For its part, the album follows the same themes as the debut and Abraxas, but expands on the improvisational concepts further (an expansion which would push even further with the next 3 albums, Caravanserai, Welcome and Borboletta). The album opens with a great medley of Batuka/Nobody to Depend On/Taboo, with Neal Schon, Santana and Rollie trading off solos over a lush latin rhythym section. Everybody's Everything is a great pop tune with some motown brass thrown in for good measure. Guajira is a fun little jam piece on a latin song, which leads into Jungle Strut, which conjures memories of the Almann's \\"Elizabeth Reed\\" with its dual guitar line harmonies and dueling guitar solos. \\"Everything is Coming Our Way\\" is another fine tune in a more pop-oriented structure, and the album is capped with a little spanish tune called \\"Para Los Rumberos\\". The remaster also has some nice fillers, live performances of songs from this album. The sound, as compared to the original CD release, sounds a lot better. That first press was pretty flat sounding, but that definitely isn't the case anymore. Definitely a must-have for serious Santana fans as it compares very favorably with Abraxas and is a big step up from the debut album. Still, the real treats are to be found on the follow-up album, Caravanserai, where Carlos really expands on the improvisational angle in a much more jazz-oriented way. Definitely worth getting, but don't stop here!
B000003TA4|5.0|Reading the reviews of this album on amazon, I noticed quite a few that were written by individuals that were under 10 when this masterpiece was released.  While, that in and of itself speaks to the magnitude of this material, quite of few of the reviews were missing something I had taken for granted as a 20 year-old college student in 1991. The ACTUAL effect this music had on the pop culture. <br /> <br />I can remember the exact MOMENT I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit for the first time.  I was sitting in an outdoor bar/restauruant and the bartender began to play the CD.  A friend of mine and I went up to the bar and asked him what he had been listening to.  At the time, mainstream music didn't sound like that - period.  Flashy videos with attractive women and long guitar solos by guys in spandex had conquered the world and we were tired of it.  Some of us were fans of the Pixies, Sonic Youth, etc. and we were ready for change. <br /> <br />I realize that younger fans might not understand the true change that took place at that time, but it was enormous.  Goodbye Warrant, Poison, Billy Idol, and Michael Jackson.  Hello Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.  And as the years passed, the \\"new\\" sound became the \\"old\\" sound as countless bands tried to jump on the wagon.  All of this, can be traced to Nirvana and Nevermind. <br /> <br />Regardless, younger fans that purchase this album - enjoy it.  And even if the changes it brought are hard to fathom 15 years later, just know that some things, however small, can change everything.
B000002A3T|5.0|This is without a doubt one of Pink Floyd best albums. It does not get the recoginion it deserves getting lost in the maze of Roger Waters albums (Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall). Don't get me wrong I love those albums but this truly deserves to be on the level of those.
0440217563|5.0|I am an avid reader and very often finish a book in just a day or two . So often I wish that I could continue to follow the characters in a book and see how thier lives end up. It has been wonderful to read these books and not have an entire lifetime summed up into two or three hundred pages or a brief glimpse into a life. I love that you get to follow this through from beginning to hopefully end. When you read as much as I do it is nice to be able to stay with the same story for a while and not be bored. The details of everyday life in our history is amazing and I am always interested to see how certain things will be done. After a lifetime of reading anything within reach there are very few literary characters that I can instantly remember without deep thought and Claire and Jamie and thier cast of characters are always memorable.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Plot: Willie Wonka an innovative business man closes his chocolate factory to the public than posts a contest for the world inviting 5 lucky winners to a tour of the factory promising a prize for one of the winners. 4 of the 5 winners of the tour are either spoiled, a brat, or obese, as for Charlie of course is a very considerate young lad and is loyal to his family.  The world inside the factory is visually STUNNING!!! From the Garden-like Candy world to the mountains of chocolate and umpa lumpas this movie has amazing effects. The Umpa Lumpa sings several really catchy songs with cynical intent to each of the spoiled brats in disco style was very entertaining.  Willie Wonka (Johnny Depp) is off in his world and does a great job acting the mentally strange Wonka.  All in all a very entertaining movie almost on the same level as the classic 'Wizard of Oz'.  The last couple movies of Tim Burton's (big fish and this one) are absolutely amazing don't miss em if you like fantasy tales!!
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|I thought the concert part of the DVD was good, not great. I've seen better live performances from them. You can by their confidence levels that they are not the same band they are today.  I think they definitely put more rock into their sound for this show. Chris Martin and guitarist Johnny Buckland seemed to be experimenting with different sounds, modified tempos and lyrics. \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Life is for Living\\" were my favorites, but unfortunately LIFL and several others weren't included in the CD. I wish the tour diary was in a more straight-forward documentary style, instead of haze, nightshots, and shaky camera, which was fine for the actual concert. I think the tour diary gave me a better feel for their personality but not any  real stories, history, or insight.
1400082773|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Extremely well written, plenty of visual descriptions and phenomenal metaphors.  While a biography, the parts I found most meaningful to me were his visions of what his life in foreign lands meant, how his experiences in New York and Chicago influenced his thinking and how he treats all people with equal reverence.  How unusual it is to have a man, who delivered such an inspiring address at the Democratic convention, whose actions mirror his words.  I sincerely hope that he is given the opportunity to run for President some day.
B00004WKII|3.0|This should be a five star collection of the truly best and most valuable of Jimi's recordings, a staggeringly inconsistent canon. It has already been noted that there are glaring omissions from his short career, a mistake that easily drops one star off right away. How can this be the career spanning masterpiece it should be when milestone moments like Woodstock and the Band of Gypsys are left out?<br /><br />Secondly, the inclusions lack the quality and genius that would go along with such a worthy undertaking. Why do we have second-rate versions of songs when the original releases are so vastly superior? Why do we have sub-par live recordings when so many better live versions are available to choose from? I realize that one of the \\"bonus\\" features of boxed sets is the fact that \\"rare\\" outtakes, demos, and live recordings are unearthed for the rabid fans, but rarely do these gems live up to the hype. Simply put, there is a reason they were never released in the first place. They should stay buried. If a fan feels uncontrollably needy, they could make them available in other forms.<br /><br />The good news is there is plenty to enjoy and, for me, the inclusion of many cuts from the extraordinary lp \\"In The West\\" makes this worth the high price. The versions of \\"Little Wing\\" and \\"Red House\\" from that old 70s lp are unparalled, as is the electrifying take on \\"Johnny B. Goode.\\" It is pure Hendrix showmanship at its finest.<br /><br />I was so hoping for more when this came out and I have to sadly say that the true value of this pricey set is that it compiles many heretofore unavailable tracks in one set. Unfortunately, there are too many pieces missing and too much filler.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Last year, I paid over $10 for a used VHS copy of hazy, dark print of the original King Kong. I needed to see the film to prepare for a writing project, and couldn't find a copy of the original in video stores, so I settled for it.<br /><br />The gusto and velocity of this special effects landmark shown through the terrible medium. It seemed a tragedy that this great film wasn't available on DVD.<br /><br />Thanks to the excitement generated by Peter Jackson's remake, we now not only have a new, cleaned-up \\"print\\" of the classic, but a whole disk full of great features.<br /><br />\\"I am King Kong\\" is a great biography of Merriam C. Cooper. It ends kind of abruptly, but is still a wonderful bit of background.<br /><br />Peter Jackson and his crew created their own history and tribute to the film. As if the weren't busy enough creating their version, they re-created the Kong figure used in the original's stop-motion sequences, and then -- my God! -- recreated the \\"lost spider pit sequence\\" using animation and live actors.<br /><br />Worth every penny.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|\\"All my songs are protest songs.\\" <br />-Bob Dylan <br /> <br />\\"I've never written a political song. Songs can't save the world.\\" <br />-Bob Dylan <br /> <br />Throughout Martin Scorsese's two-hundred minute documentary we get to see Bob Dylan squirm under a barage of journalist questions. Several times he just asks the questions right back at them, and at one point starts snapping pictures of the photographers themselves. Dylan is portrayed as a chameleon, refusing to be a spokesman for the left or put on a pedestal by the folk movement. The closer Scorsese gets to his subject the blurrier he becomes. <br /> <br />The story of Dylan is framed nicely within the turbulent times his music came about. When pictures of Dylan's sleepy Midwest town is flashed across the screen it's apparent that the straight laced conformity was indicative of the nation as a whole. <br /> <br />No sooner are we are introduced to the restless kid who enrolled in college but never went to any classes, then we see him skirt to New York where he is rumoured to have followed in the footsteps of the old bluesmen, and sells his soul to the devil. Shortly after, his mediocre playing is transformed into confident musicianship. <br /> <br />During the times Dylan is in New York you can almost feel the pressure that was building in America. This is also the time where he probably gained a political consciousness that he would later accept or deny depending on how he felt, or maybe on who was asking. <br /> <br />The majority of the concert footage contains booing and heckling from the crowd. I had always heard about the controversy concerning Dylan \\"plugging in,\\" but it is something else to actually witness it. <br /> <br />This documentary has a long running time, but it never dragged. I was constanty intrigued, and always engaged. No Direction Home is richly layered and deals with a lot more than just Bob Dylan -- I'm sure I don't understand half of it. Scorsese show us a scene of Andy Warhol andDylan right before he cuts to some British fans deriding the new Dylan music as \\"pop.\\" As is the case with any Scorsese movie, it is about a lot more than what's up on the screen. In some way No Direction Home is about the changing art of the sixties. It was this decade that modernism started to visibly give way to the post-modern movement, and that's represented here as Dylan claims his music is a collage of influences. <br /> <br />The relation between Dylan and his music also intrigued me. The Beats and many of these folk musicians viewed art as a truthful unveiling. Much of this film will have you wondering if Dylan's music concealed as much as it revealed. The idea of an artistic \\"Truth\\" is chipped away at, and instead Dylan lets little \\"truths\\" slip out of his art. There is an act going on whenever Dylan writes a song, and especially when he performs a song. At times it is almost as if he is creating a personality out of bits of images and sounds he finds in the world, and then puts them together to create something fresh. <br /> <br />The film manages to deal with multiple themes without losing sight of its subject. In fact, it is precisely because the film deals with so much that it didn't lose my interest despite its length. Scorsese has shown us one of America's great artist, and in the process proves that he also belongs in that category. <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|As a music lover I've always dreamed of discovering an album that would take me away to somewhere I've never been and never let me go back.  I thought I had it with Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 until this little masterpiece came along.  So hot I'm surprised the cd doesn't actually melt! <br /> <br />I won't duplicate what has already been said other than say that by creating an autobiographical album to a disco-beat, it is a potentially disastrous affair, let alone being ambitious enough to segue each track as if a non-stop megamix.  Yet it works.... <br /> <br />Each song is distinctive enough to stand out on its own merits, with choruses catchy enough to make you sing, while having the dance-savvy and class of a reputable club trak.  Few artists command such broad cross-over appeal. <br /> <br />I play it in my car, play it on my ipod in the gym and dance to it @ clubs....and yet I still yearn for more. <br /> <br />The great thing about the album is that we see parts of Madonna (hence the Confessions reference) we've maybe not seen as clearly before.  Her analysis of fame, celebrity, etc, etc.....but yet there's still room for euphoria.  Perhaps the only artist worthy enough of sampling ABBA and doing so so brilliantly on Hung Up, or allowing us time for escape (Jump....or the opening lines of Let It Will Be...''forget about loans, administration'')......this album has it all <br /> <br />Push, Sorry & Jump alone make this album worth buying.   <br /> <br />Perhaps Madonna's chef d'oeuvre....COAD underlines a living legend with increasing capability for evolution and reinvention (as her last tour extolled....Reinvent Yourself).....will I still be dancing to this cd in 5 years' time?  You bet....and will no doubt be a few 1lbs lighter for the privilege. <br /> <br />
0596007124|5.0|I bought the book last week and I'm about half way through it so far.  Finding it an enjoyable and enlightening read.  So often in the past, I have read books containing really stupid and irritating jokes.  Not here - I actually laughed to myself on some of the musings in this book (e.g., see p 38).   <br /> <br />The book actually provides some deep insight into achieving better designs and the proper use of patterns and I recommend that folks be familiar with OO design principles to get the most from this book.  <br /> <br />Also, as the book states, a knowledge of Java is useful but not essential.  Happy reading.
6305313687|4.0|What I liked most about the movie is its non-biased, unstereotypical view of people getting into the dilemma of committing race-related crimes. That's why I'd rather call this a film and not a movie because it's far away from any Hollywood-commercial-happy-end productions.It aims at understanding how easily our own environment can become a ground for everyone's own evil potential to grow. Undoubtedly we all experience the manupilative impact of our surroundings, not only the obvious effect of right-wing propaganda but also of educational efforts as shown by Dr. Sweeney. The viewer realizes it won't do to put the blame on others for things that shaped and determined their own life but to take action oneself to make sure that our ''memory'' (...) will be once ''touched'' again '' by the better angels of our nature.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|i really don't like emo music very much but one of my friends who is really into it told me to listen to Panic! At the Disco, so i bought their album and I loved it at once. They have lots of really catchy dance beats and great lyrics too. i would defintley give it a listen.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I usually laugh at these types of movies given their lack of true credibility when it comes to believing that a super hero really exists.  Superman for example, required a man from another planet - unlikely.  However, this batman shows from scratch how it is possible.  I always wondered where a guy like Michael Keaton had the time to build all the toys -the cave, the fancy equipement, planes, boats, etc. etc.  Not too realistic.    The rediculous evolution of fancier, blingier, more hollywoodistic toys, like the spinning light show that brings the batmobile up and ready to drive off.  Where does a guy who is busy fighting crime come up with time for that?  And for what purpose?  It's all hollywood, and it kills the reality of the character.  Arnold and Clooney pretty much put the nail on the coffin for that crap.    But thank god for this episode.  Not to say the toys were not unrealistic, but they were explained.  And they were tested, and modified, and of course already developed by real scientists who had no clue what they would end up being used for.    Really, the only unrealistic things I found were that a stone mansion would burn down so easily.  Does a billionaire not have a sprinker system?  Or the rediculous subway system that seemed to soar right to wayne enterprises, and how simply it all came down with a few shots in one of the support beams.    Never mind just finding the raw strength to pull a huge man like Liam with one hand up the side of a mountain, only holding on by the glove with spikes in the other hand - that was simply not possible for a man his size who had just exerted all of his enery escaping an exploding building.    Or the \\"feature\\" boy that always seems to spot batman and be saved by batman.  There are probably thousands of kids running in the city, but of course our feature kid always gets to see batman.    But still, I loved the details.  By the time he became batman, you knew how and why, and were right there with him ready to kicksome ass.  The story line is not consistent with the past versions, for example, Commissioner Gordon spots batman for the first time in the original, but in this episode, he is still just a grunt working along side a developing batman.  And the story of Jack (the Joker) killing his parents is no longer possible, given he was shot in court (at least that's what we think happened).  The Joker was previewed, so I hope that the genuiness carries on for the next episode.  If you listen carefully to the last line of the movie, \\"robbery, double homicide\\", you realize that he was in fact not killed in the courthouse - it just occurred to me.    And major kudos to Morgan Freeman - he is truely the light in every movie he stars in - he is the hope and inspiration that makes us all believe anything is possible.  Gary Oldman was ok, he's getting pumped up as a great actor, but really I saw nothing exciting about his role here - anyone could have done it.    But the director was very careful here with the details.  For example, batman wears the black makup around the eyes, obviously, but in the scene where he takes his mask off, you think, hmm, will that black makeup be there?  Well, let's just take a shot from the back and we don't have to address that issue.
B00000DGUY|5.0|A great collection of songs, and some of the best audio quality I've ever heard from a standard CD.  Turn this one up on a high-end system and enjoy the crisp clean sound.
0316172324|5.0|I believe that Malcolm Gladwell belongs to the new generation of authors - the ones who definately look at the things out of the box and take their readers with them. The best thing about the Blink is that it makes you reflect on your own expereinces in life, even makes you think in a different dimention. I found this book a fascinating and easy reading - great book to read after work and add more enthusiasm into the daily routine. This book definately stays in your mind for a long time as a point of reference - and if you are interested in a deeper understanding of one of the concepts, Gladwell offers a wonderful choice of literature for the curious minds.
B000002BBY|5.0|A great album. One of the best albums of all time. However, the antics of the Gallagher brothers prevent me from saying one of the best groups of all time. They are both arrogant jerks who frequently don't finish a concert because of internal bickering which in my book doesn't rate you \\"rock and roll\\" but unprofessional. Luckily, for them, their music is very good but people and fans will grow tired of the \\"act\\".  Until then, enjoy the ride while you can boys.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Having Asperger's Syndrome, I was having trouble picturing what is in the book, so when I watched the movie I finally had an idea of what the setting was. What came to a surprise to me was that Rosalind Chao (Keiko O'Brien in Star Trek DS9) was in it. I liked that, but I also liked the emotion behind the mothers when they were young, especially An-Mei. It was saddening when we saw why Suyuan had to leave her two babies behind; I can't tell you why, that would spoil it. I liked this better than the book.
B000002JOH|5.0|If you thought that Cowboys from Hell was heavy, then brace yourself for this one. Pantera kicked the heaviness up a notch for this release. Phil Anselmo abandons his screams for more of a growling sound, but it fits the music well. This album was released in February 1992, when the world was obsessed with grunge acts such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam. But Pantera stuck to their guns and stayed to true to what they wanted, and that was to make a good metal album. <br /> <br />There's a lot of Pantera classics on here including the aggressive Mouth for War. You gotta love it when the song speeds up and Phil yells \\"No one can piss on this determination!\\" at the end. And then there is the mid-paced Walk, which I am sure many of you have heard. \\"Are you talking to me? No way punk\\" Gotta love that. I also love F*cking Hostile, probably one of the fastest songs they ever wrote. Tell me if you can listen to that song and not want to beat the living daylights out of someone. Another classic is the power ballad This Love, which has a killer music video and one of Dimebag's best guitar solos. And then after the gentle ending of This Love, BAM! the song Rise kicks in and it is FAST! Phil screams his guts out while Vinnie Paul totally annihilates his drums (don't know HOW he does it so fast)  Other faves include No Good (Attack the Radical) which has a good message, the stomping A New Level, and the emotional power ballad Hollow (about a friend of the band who was in a coma). I also like By Demons be Driven. Listening to this song is the musical equivalent of getting socked in the face by concrete. Vinnie sounds like he is trying to rip his drums apart on this one. <br /> <br />So there you have it. But trust me, words CANNOT do this album justice, it is one of those albums you just have to hear. You don't know what you're missing if you don't buy this album <br />
B000002UB6|4.0|It was heartbreaking for millions of people around the world to face the fact the Beatles were no more.  I don't agree that this album is bad or not up to par.  I think that there are many excellent songs here that would have been wonderful if they were fully fleshed out on a real album with George Martin.  As it is, it is still a great piece of work. <br /> <br />1. Two Of Us-5/5.  This is a great collaboration between John and Paul.  The music is real folky and the lyrics follow suit, but the strong point here is the harmonies between the two.  It adds something to the song that elevates it above average. <br />2. I Dig A Pony-5/5.  My original vinyl record has the \\"I\\" although the CD version doesn't.  This is a strong rocker from John, with his trademark weird lyrics.  The chorus is very sing-a-long and anthemic.  One of his best songs. <br />3. Across the Universe-5/5.  This version is different from the original version released on a wildlife preservation charity album.  This version is far superior.  It is slower and the vocals sound more emotional from John.  Excellent. <br />4. I Me Mine-3/5.  George's songs on this album were weaker than his previous songs were.  The lyrics aren't up to par and the music isn't all that great either.  George's vocals are very good though. <br />5. Dig It-2/5.  This is some nonsense 30 seconds of John shouting out the acronyms of various governmental agencies.  Pointless. <br />6. Let It Be-5/5.  This version is slightly different from the single version, which is better.  It sounds more real.  This version just isn't quite as good.  Beautiful ballad from Paul. <br />7. Maggie Mae-3/5.  Short little bluesy song from John and Paul.  I believe this is a traditional song, but the two of them sing it.  Nothing special. <br />8. I've Got A Feeling-5/5.  Great overlooked gem of a song.  The music is excellent.  This is one of my favorite Beatle songs ever.  The vocals by both John and Paul are superb. <br />9. One After 909-3/5.  This is an updated version of a song that they wrote for the \\"Please Please Me\\" album that they never could get right.  Very upbeat bluesy rocker.  This version isn't very good.  The original version on the \\"Anthology 1\\" CD is much better. <br />10. The Long and Winding Road-5/5.  Another beautiful ballad from Paul and one of my favorites ever.  It has been said that Paul didn't like the background choral arrangements that Spector added to it, but I think it takes the song to a much different level and makes the song almost angelic.  Perfect. <br />11. For You Blue-3/5.  Boring little blues song from George.  The lyrics are very repetitive, the music is boring, although the slide guitar solo is excellent.   <br />12. Get Back-5/5.  This version is a little shorter than the single version released the year before.  The single version is much better in my opinion.  Sort of bluesy with some strange lyrics from Paul, but he sings them very well. <br /> <br />The main problem that I have with this album is all of the talking and banter back and forth between the songs, along with the addition of \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"Dig It\\".  Both of those should have been left off, along with the talking in between the songs.  It sounds very unprofessional.  However, the songs themselves are excellent.  Much better than many people would lead you to believe.  Strongly recommended for anyone who likes rock and roll.
B000002KDO|5.0|Okay you practically pushed heavy metal light-years forward with Paranoid, and now you have to follow it up. Well the boys did just that, and they did it well. In my opinion, this album is darker and heavier than the two before it. For 1971, this was pretty much untouchable. <br /> <br />Sweet Leaf starts with a hacking cough, and then BAM you're hit with a slow metallic groove. Other heavy moments include Lord of this World, Into the Void, and Children of the Grave. Children of the Grave is simply HEAVY, i mean tell me you can't headbang to that! Embryo and Orchid are instrumentals. Embryo is haunting while Orchid is more emotional, probably the most comfortable moment on the album. Solitude is a sad ballad type of song that can bring a tear to the eye. After Forever is another heavy number. \\"Would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope, do you think he's a fool?\\" I think everyone remembers this line. <br /> <br />So....this is a heavy metal milestone. WAY ahead of it's time blah blah blah, just buy the album and enjoy it!
0307276902|1.0|I was really touched by this \\"memoir\\" until thesmokinggun.com burst my bubble.  Now I feel sucker punched. A book can't qualify as a memoir if huge chunks are a fictional re-telling of events. I don't care what Oprah says or how many people she claims this fabricated story has helped. Frey is a fraud and a huge (and now rich) disappointment.
B000002KHH|5.0|I mean, seriously, how can you begin to describe this album? This album damn near made heavy metal what it is today. Many metalheads cite this album as a favorite and for good reason! People didn't know what to expect of this in 1970. You just didn't hear stuff like this back then. Tony played his guitar like no else and i wonder how he came up with this stuff! and Ozzy is well, Ozzy. His voice definitely made the band, anyone else would not have been able to pull off the power of this album. <br /> <br />This album is filled with classics. It starts off with War Pigs, an early metal classic. I really love the Luke's Wall part, very melodic guitar playing. Then there is Paranoid, which i think EVERYONE has heard before. We also have the slow and brooding Electric Funeral and Hand of Doom, which pretty much gave the doom metal genre its name. And you gotta dig the instrumental Rat Salad, which showcases the amazing drumming of Bill Ward. Iron Man has one of metal's most recognizable riffs (how does Tony do that?) and Planet Caravan is slow and trippy. Ozzy sounds like he is under water or something. Jack the Stripper is a nice melodic beginning to the heavy Fairies Wear Boots (supposedly it was written about a time where the band was attacked by skinheads but don't quote me). <br /> <br />As my friend Chuck so eloquently puts it, \\"Without Black Sabbath, heavy metal wouldn't f*cking exist.\\" And that is good enough for me. So why am I sitting here reviewing an album that everyone should own anyway? This is one purchase you won't regret!
B00006879E|5.0|My cousin brought this CD over a long time ago and played it while we were hanging out and I couldn't help but lose my train of thought while listening to this refreshing album.  I say refreshing because from the lyrics down to the vibe the album gives off, this CD is different from the rest.  Now everyone has hear \\"She will be loved\\" because I think it was on rotation at every radio station for air-time almost every twenty minutes, but that song aside the rest of the CD is great...and not to say I don't like the song it's just that I've heard it so much it may take a while before I puposfully turn it on.  \\"Harder to breath\\" the opening track is wonderful and I can never get enough of it.  \\"This love\\" is another hit, another single and thank god the radio didn't overplay those two too much.  \\"Secret is one of my favorite songs on the CD with a cool laid back vibe that reminds me of a cocktail bar somewhere back in the 50's where everyone wore Capone hats, sipped whiskey and smoked cigars while some guy in a tux played the piano and sang to the women in the room.  Come to think if it that me be a great video idea for this band, doing a black and white 50's style mafia sort of thing.  Anyways!!!  \\"Shiver\\" and \\"The Sun\\" are awsome songs, in fact the whole CD is a great compliment of itself and for the most part should be listened to from start to finish to get the full effect.  Another standout is the inclution of a live track...\\"Not Coming Home\\" which in my opinion is a real standout.  I've seen these guys live and they really know who to worka crowd.  They sound just as good on stage and really add a uniquness to todays music.
B0001L3LUE|2.0|Poet Philip Larkin wrote that sex began in 1963.  Actually, it was 1961, January.  That's when the kids and Whiz Kids with hair and testosterone came to town, and when old dull bald Eisenhower and his wife with Bettie-Pageboy bangs went back to the farm.  That's when sex began.  <br /> <br />Robert McNamara, with flipcharts and probing, pointed questions and thrusting, pointed pointers was the brave new world's most improbable and potent sex symbol.  Camelot, 1961, was a party at which women, the best and the brightest, wanted to be seated next to Robert McNamara.  Then the war came.  The whole world was watching as strange Robert McNamara changed his spots or sloughed his cold skin or melted down (or whatever reptiles do) and became a reptile.  Then he faded away. <br /> <br />This film brings him back as a reptilian and equivocal Mr. Know It All.  It creates for him Eleven Lessons, although God was satisfied with only ten and although McNamara himself had only a Ten Point Plan for saving the world from itself and from Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. <br /> <br />Robert McNamara's Eleven Lessons teach us nothing beyond the lesson painfully learned long ago that America was imperiled by entrusting power to a kid like Robert McNamara.  They also raise old ghosts: <br /> <br />*  McNamara playfully admits that his president, John Kennedy, won the presidency with a lie, the slander that General Eisenhower allowed a missile gap in the USSR's favor.  Harvard's Kennedy was briefed throughout the 1960 campaign by friends from the CIA, which was saturated with Harvard elitists.  The CIA was also saturated with the certainty that a Soviet-slanted missile gap was a lie.  The CIA had that certainty because the CIA's Richard Bissel, a Harvard elitist, had designed the spy plane that proved beyond doubt that Eisenhower had maintained American missile superiority, a superiority we kept until the progressive era of detente. <br /> <br />*  McNamara recycles the Thirteen-Days mythologyof 1962's Cuban Missile Crisis.  General Curtis LeMay -- not Khrushchev (who emplaced missiles and warheads in Cuba) or Castro (who wanted to launch them against America even after the crisis was \\"resolved\\") -- is the mythology's designated villain.  The mythology's heroes are the Democrats who srote the mythology.  (Leftist Eric Alterman offers a necessary corrective and a truthful synopsis of the 1962 crisis in his recent book, When Presidents Lie.) <br /> <br />*  McNamara seems to affirm Oliver Stones thesis that JFK, had he lived, would have drawn down his nascent Vietnam War and ended it.  The problem with the thesis is that there were two assassinations in November 1963, several weeks before the draw-down was to begin.  JFK was murdered on November 22 (Clue:  By the Communist.  With the Mannlicher-Carcano.  In the Depository.)  That was after another assassination that married America to Vietnam for a very long time.  That was the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, America's ally in South Vietnam. <br /> <br />Our Left effected the near-destruction of CIA-FBI coordination because our clandestine services may have been complicit in assassination attempts against avowed enemies of America.  Even now there are whirlwinds of concern and firestorms of depair about plots against Cuba's Castro and Chile's Allende.  About the murder of Diem, America's feckless friend, there is silence aside from inadvertent occasions when someone like McNamara hints at what happened in early November 1962.  Let me speak the unspoken and overwhelming question:  Did John Kennedy or someone close to him order the assassination of an American ally, or permit it with a wink and a patrician nod?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Why don't the leftists who write our history and our mythology?    <br />  <br /> <br />
B00009ATIX|3.0|First off I'm a huge Lem fan and Solaris is the one book I had read four times and will probably read again. I wasn't all too convinced by Tarkovskis adaption which is a great piece of cinematic art but doesn't deliver what the book was about in its core. Lem wasn't happy with the movie neither. This new adaption he accepted more easily, but not wholeheartly.    To me, there's one specific thing about Lem's work that was not present in Soderbergh's adaption. Sure, one thing is a book, the other is a movie, there shouldn't be much of a comparison, but I was SO let down by the fact that everything else was taken into the movie but NOT the main theme, which was the question of communications, be it with human or alien beings.    In Solaris, people are trying to solve one huge problem. They found this planet that is moving between two suns which is not a seldom thing. But this one isn't behaving correctly: it should only be a matter of time untill the planet gets blown away by one of the suns due to gravitation rules. This one is different. The problem is that this planet might mean that one of the most important physical laws could turn out to be wrong, absolutly wrong. It would be like finding evidence nowadays that our planet in fact IS flat. This would trigger so many questions, it would turn it all upside down. Countless universities are trying to find out if science had been COMPLETLY WRONG, students are doing studies on the subject. So that is the reason why astronauts were sent up there to begin with. In the movie, they are doing \\"energy research\\". Is this a detail? Hell no it ain't.    In the book, the scientists have absolutly no explanation on anything, they have been doing experiments during the last fifty years or so but they could not repeat one single experiment and get the same result. Whatever they did, the ocean planet SOLARIS never ever behaved in a way that could even give an idea of what this planet is all about. Now the story begins with the arrival of Kelvin. His mission is not only to look after the astronauts but also to make one huge decision: should the whole Solaris project be stopped due to huge costs and no useful results or should they go on and keep looking for clues? It is in Kelvins hands to make this decision. And this also is an important point of the story. Science had never found an explanation, they could only file the side effects of the planet. All they could do was watch and be dazzled, but there was no way to influence or trigger something willingly. Sometimes the ocean did not react on an experiment, sometimes it did, but never twice the same way. And while they are looking for explanations they get these visitors who don't know themselves what it all is about. They even quesionize why they hadn't questionized their being there... on a space station light years away from home. Even the visitors do not have an explanation. They can only watch, and if their host is leaving their field of view they freak out. So they HAVE to see their hosts. In the end the scientists are the ones being researched and observed. For what reason they don't know.    Lem mostly is giving you a special Sci-Fi scenario in which something ALWAYS become clear: these are humans. But Solaris is a place where there is not one single human motive. It is not a place for humans, it has nothing human to it, it goes beyond any possible human explanation, just like a cat would never understand that art and movies exist. Nevertheless, humans are using their human brain to solve a totally un-human thing by asking human questions. Science means asking questions. But every question has the answer already, be it fully or partly. If you are researching the biohazard level of some specific water the result will be restricted due to your restricted thinking pattern. If humans wouldn't have found out that biohazard exists they would have been looking for a totally different thing and found a satisfying answer whatsoever. Lem always successfully shows that in science there are human thinkers, no gods. The problem human people have between each other is absolutly the same the scientists have with Solaris, and therefore that science has, fundamentally. In the book, there are people interacting with each other and the planet. In both cases the communication fails for exactly the same reason, although one is an alien ocean planet, the other is a human.     So in Lem's work one point was to show the impossibility NOT to communicate. There cannot be NO Communication but missunderstood communications due to lack of the possibility to fully identify with and understand the other.    This film is not a good adaption. But it's an interesting love story taking place in space. It's just not Solaris and that is not so bad. If only Soderbergh wouldn't be this convinced by having adapted the original material. Looks like he didn't understand the book by no chance.
0679422714|5.0|Yesterday's New York Times (23 January) expends about two dozen column inches on Bush: The Unknown Story.  Elisabeth Bumiller informs a grateful nation that the Newspaper of Record is still on the job, recording this week's gotcha of a president who eavesdrops illegally (see the New York Times, December 2005 to present), tortures freedom fighters (see the New York Times, 2001 to present), and betrays CIA agents (see the Plame Name Blame Game via Judith Miller.) <br /> <br />Yesterday's scoop du jour?  Bumiller reports that Bush reads.  Bumiller further reports that Bush is reading Mao: The Unknown Story, which \\"has been embraced by the right as a searing indictment of Communism\\" and which \\"was published to mixed reviews.\\" <br /> <br />\\"To be honest,\\" said historian and plagiarist Doris Kearns Goodwin, \\"I'm not certain that it's so weird for him to be reading this,\\" but that's probably a minority opinion, probably not shared by Elisabeth Bumiller and the New York Times.  Nick Kristof's recent NYT review of Mao: The Unknown Story, implied that he knows Mao's story better than the book's authors know it.  Kristof indicted authors Jung Chang and Jon Halliday of wallowing in (to use Bumiller's words) \\"a moralistic, good-and-evil version of history.\\"  As every reader of the New York Times knows, moralistic good-and-evil versions of things appeal profoundly to our boy-in-a-bubble president. <br /> <br />Nuance appeals to Kristof and his Times.  Mao, to nuanced intellectuals, was a mitigated monster, an agrarian reformer and social engineer making omelettes and breaking a few (c.70,000,000) eggs.  Mao was a liberal in a hurry.  In his rush to utopia, mistakes were sometimes made. <br /> <br />Mr. Kristof and the New York Times are entitled to their own nuances, but let's pray (Bush, according to the Times, does that too) their nuances don't extend to national socialism's utopia.  Would Kristof and Times intellectuals cut slack for Hitler because no document directly implicates him in c.7,000,000 murders? <br /> <br />(Documentation and sourcing, by the way, are the proximate causes of Halliday and Chang's mixed reviews.  As noted on this site, Andrew Nathan deconstructed several Mao footnotes and conclusions.  In the absence of survivors -- Mao's 70,000,000 body count is not disputed -- there may be no final answer to Mao's final solution.) <br /> <br />
B00005V0X5|4.0|i'm getting a feeling that people are underrating this album and it pisses me off. i love this album its raw fast and cool im not saying its their best but it is very underrated and more people should listein to it especially last rites  and rattlehead and the tittle track this album is a great example of thrash metal and now that i think of it this deserves five stars
0790729407|5.0|Some \\"Collins\\" updates are worth mentioning, esp. for film historians, e.g., the presence of a very young Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in a brief but pivotal role in this film, an early major break in his career. Also worth mentioning that this winter, Neil Jordan is back with a film, Breakfast on Pluto, with many of the Michael Collins cast, including Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea, the latter a standout in that film as well as in 'Michael Collins.' Indeed, Mr. Rea's work in Michael Collins is worth re-viewing as great understated acting -- his Ned Broy is really quite touching (compare with Rea's role as a detective in \\"Citizen X\\" -- he's good in those parts).    (Update, April 2006: Stephen Rea appears in the new release \\"V for Vendetta\\" -- as a detective.)    It's also worth analyzing this story, as a story, in the post-9/11 world. Although the movie says little about the vicious war in the countryside, between the Black and Tans and Collins' flying columns -- mind you, it does have him telling them to fight on their own terms, a central tactic in any unconventional (asymmetric) conflict -- it does have him emphasizing the need to capture arms to sustain the struggle. (Touched on later when his agents return from a hit, show him the newspaper headline, Detective Riddled With Bullets, and his angry reaction, \\" 'Riddled?' 'Riddled?!!' What're you goin' round riddlin' people for? 10 or 20 bullets when the one will do? ... They don't grow on trees!\\")    This sort of conflict -- whether or not you want to call it \\"terrorist\\" -- does get argued out in the film, and not just as a depiction of a brutish military response by the Black and Tans. Eamonn de Valera is also shown as an advocate for the old conventional clash of arms, e.g., the attack on the Customs House, arguing against a Michael Collins wanting to \\"play by our own rules.\\" The film rightly makes a central incident of the killing of the British detectives, for Collins seemed to have grasped that detectives, in an urban war, are not just combatants but central to this kind of conflict. Bloody Sunday, the day Michael Collins effectively blinded the British Secret Service, and a central sequence in this film, seems to have been a turning point, leaving the other side with nothing but the Black and Tans -- the sports-field reprisal was perhaps not historically accurate but as a metaphor it works. In a conflict like post-9/11 any intelligence -- police intelligence, financial intelligence, \\"names, addresses, clubs, society columns, where they bank, down to what they eat for breakfast,\\" (Collins' comment) is crucial to success for such a movement. Or to hunting it down.    In fairness to Julia Roberts, it's worth noting that she was hobbled by a peripheral role, subdued dialogue and the hideous fashions of the day -- not to mention the centrality of the friendship, and falling-out, of Harry Boland and Michael Collins. (She might have had a far meatier role if Mr. Jordan had cast her as the fiery rebel Countess Markiewicz, arguably the La Pasionaria of that day).    DVD very much worth owning.

B00000ICN5|5.0|Texas Flood is the debut album of SRV. Very few debut albums can ever be compared to this one. <br />Stevie Ray has four of his finest songs on this album. <br />The songs are, Love Struck Baby, Pride and Joy which is probably his signature song.. <br />Texas Flood in my mind is his finest blues song of his career. <br />Rude Mood is another song of note. <br />What you have here is the master doing his thing. SRV is probably the finest blues player ever (some might argue Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix) <br />We do know one thing. SRV has left his legacy for all of those who love the blues.  <br />His guitarmanship is legandary..............this is one album to savor. <br />
B00005R62K|5.0|ah man this cd is just so great i cant even explain it the vocals from the world famous rob halford are just great this is his best performance yet especially on exciter wich is one of my favorite priest songs ever this album is so solid and influential to every metalhead and you dissagree you are just ridiculous  cause if you dont like priest do not consider youreself a metal head. the solos on this album are great all priest solos are great pretty much and the song i have to talk about is my favorite priest song is beyond the realms of death its just a great ballad better than any ballad ever and rob halford voice is so kick arse you must buy this album it is worth every cent
0307276902|5.0|This is a great book!  It's written so that it feels as if you are thinking what he is writing and it's not meant to be some literary great, but instead an account of a man's journey through drug abuse.  And in case anyone who doesn't have experience with drugs, it's hard to remember all the facts all the time.  You mainly remember your feelings and pieces of things that happened.  The guy never said it was non-fiction!  And how accurate could any account of life be through a blurry drug haze.  I say well done James!  Well done!
B000001FTD|4.0|this is a great solid album from the \\"big fours\\" most underrated band this a great band that more metal heads need to get into but back to the album the first five trackks are great awsome i love listeining to it with a great opener and the classic anthrax song caught in a moshthan the song that is one of my favorite anthrax song ever i am the law than we go to the song efilnukinfusin after we have skeletons in the closet which is another awsome songf but than we have indians no a horrible song but it ruins the flow a little bit  the next track one world is my least favorite this album can do withought that we have a.d.i a cool song not bad and than immitation of life good song not boring good closer
B000C3H4M2|3.0|Talking Heads, one of the greatest, most innovative rock bands ever, are not well represented by Rhino's new series of expanded reissues on DualDisc.  <br /> <br />For my money, Fear of Music was Talking Heads' peak and is as close to perfect as an album can be. The \\"CD\\" side of this DualDisc does offer a nice mastering job that's equal to the analog original (minus the vinyl crackles). If you're lucky, your CD player will play it, because a lot of the Amazon reviews for the new Heads DualDiscs indicate that people are having problems playing them. The four bonus tracks are interesting for a fan like me who has loved this album for 25 years, but they really aren't something to listen to more than a couple of times. <br /> <br />The \\"DVD\\" side of this DualDisc is disappointing and points to the poor choices that Rhino has made with the Talking Heads catalog. There's a \\"surround-sound\\" remix of the original LP. Personally, I couldn't care less about a remix 25 years after the fact. There's also some skimpy video content, two performances of Fear of Music songs from a 1980 German TV concert. The footage is great, but it really belongs with Remain in Light, as it features the expanded lineup that toured that LP. And if Rhino did these reissues the right way (separate CD and DVD discs, which the European market is getting for these issues), we could have gotten the full-length concert. <br /> <br />To top it off, these reissues are packaged in digipaks. Digipaks might be OK for standard CDs, but these DualDisks have information on both sides, and the digipaks offer pretty poor protection for whichever side of the disc is facing out.
B000002H97|1.0|okay im so pissed off that people are saying this is a masterpiece its garbage its not a masterpiece if a two year old can play all the song on this album. this is ridiculous i ahte people that say this is metallicas last of the best cause its not ...and justice for all is okay this is gay stuff and this album is junk for all new metal heads do not buy this album it is a comercial gey album with no musical talent what so ever listein to real metallica like kill 'em all ride the lightning master of the puppets ...and justice for all do not waste youre time with this plain old garbage and i cant bealive all the posers that are giving this album five stars you are probably the same people who give great albuyms like hell awaits and kill 'em all and killing is my business...and business is good bad review you all are posers do not try to act like youre real metal heads and do not try to make people follow in youre direction by telling them albums like this one are masterpieces
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Uh, somebody needs to be supervising whoever writes these descriptions a little closer....this is the new version with 4 bonus tracks including a great rough demo of the dog-eared \\"Teach Your Children\\"??? Or is it not??? No more bong breaks for you guys.....Oh yeah, this is a landmark recording and should be in everybody's collection; perfect singing, playing and writing, often copied, never done better..... <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I love this music, Avril has pretty strong singing voice and she plays the guitar, piano, and i love her style and lyric writing.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|This is just to clarify an earlier \\"review\\" which disputed the aspect ratios as listed in the DVD details. <br /> <br />Those who have watched this DVD all the way through can attest that the TV version IS indeed presented in 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen. The only exception to this being the title scenes of the TV Version which are presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio created by cropping (matting) the 4:3 TV Version. <br /> <br />To say again in no uncertain terms: The TV Version of Dune offered on this DVD set (ASIN:B0007PAMR4) IS presented in 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen. <br /> <br />I make a point of mentioning this as this has been an area of uncertainty for quite some time with much speculation circulating (as perpetuated by reviews like the one written by \\"T. F.\\" from Visalia, CA) <br /> <br />Please see here: [...] for screenshots and further confirmation of this fact. <br /> <br />Also it can be confirmed that this release does NOT contain a DTS track.
B000002VCQ|5.0|If you have a record player I honestly suggest you buy this used as a RECORD as well as a CD.  Whitney's vocals are the highlight of this album.  So pure and captivating, you'll want to play this album over and over.  Each single (Except the underrated \\"You Give Good Love\\") was a #1 hit.  When you listen, you remember why she was a superstar in the 80's.  She was incredibly beautiful and extremely talented--the recepe for sucess.  The upbeat \\"How Will I Know\\", the remake of \\"Greatest Love Of All\\" and the anxious \\"Saving All My Love For You\\" are all highlights.  Unfortunately rumours of drug use and her controversial home life have deterd her from being as big as she once was, but if you want to re-live her glory days get this album.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I remember when this album was released and I was in Grade School.  I remember seeing his face on Time and Newsweek magazines.  I remember holding up the album at least a dozen times in the winter of that year.  I remember hearing a radio concert from Cleveland in the summer of '78 that I swear was at least 3 hours long.  But I was never a Bruce fan.  I had just turned into a teenager and Kiss, Alice Cooper, The Sweet, and Deep Purple were my tastes and on my turntable.  The song \\"Born to Run\\" was on the radio but it didn't do all that much for me.<br /><br />  Fast forward to college and 2 characters from the Philly area, (Philly & Mac) were torturing me with this record, Greetings, and Darkness for 2 whole semesters that by the time I returned home, I actually missed hearing Springsteen.  Not that I really liked his music but it did grow on me and I started to miss it.  Zeppelin, Maiden, Sweet, and Lizzy are still my favorite bands but when I heard about this upcoming release, I really became excited.  Not as much for the album or the documentary (both very well done by the way) but the concert from 1975.  When Bruce and his band were hungry and on top of their game.  I have to admit, my favorite tunes of his are \\"It's Hard to be a Saint in the City\\", \\"Growin' Up\\", \\"I Came For You\\", and \\"Rosalita\\".  So I really wanted to see this concert from the Hammersmith.  A few of those tunes aren't included here and some of his pre-BTR stuff I really don't care for are here but the concert is fantastic.  A little dark but folks let's remember that the time was 1975, lighting and recording technology was what it was.  This concert is to really be enjoyed for the energy and the songs, THE Springsteen live experience.  This does not disappoint unless the song selecion doesn't include your favorites.<br /><br />  The entire package (album, documentary, concert) is well done and well worth the money.  I am surprised that neither the documentary nor the concert weren't released on their own a while ago.  A worthy purchase for the casual Bruce fan, a MUST for the true fan of this man and his music.own a while ago.

B000002U9W|3.0|1970's \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" has appeal for a few reasons. There are alot of musical germs here that would later grow into more successful songs on other albums. This is similar in tracking to their next album, \\"Meddle\\" with a gigantic suite sprawling over one side of the record, and then regular four minute tunes on the other side. The difference between \\"Meddle\\" and this, is that the second side is really not worth a whole lot, save Richard Wright's \\"Summer 68\\" which is a number about stupid groupies with a brilliant bombastic bridge that dwarfs the subject matter a little. Would've worked better with a heavier theme than one night stands with hippy girls. This is probably Floyd's most egalitarian record, as all three writing members get a shot at one song apiece. Oddly, Gilmour and Waters' offerings are flat. \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" is complete dross, only worth mentioning for what a waste of 13 minutes it is. The title track is quite pretty, and pretty weird too, certainly their most symphonic composition, and probably sounds earth shattering with the right pot.     Not a necessity to get, but not a total waste of money either. A mixed bag.
B0000062GK|5.0|This album by Satriani is extremely hard to classify both in its place in the instrumental guitar genre and in Joe`s discography.However, it is undeniably a first class job.     Satch`s techical control over his instrument is unquestionable, but he does not confine his fret work so as to please aspiring shredders who are only satisfied by lightning speed 6 string sweeping arpeggios. With that said, Satch is still second to none for those who seek undiluted musicianship and instrumental tracks full of creativity and a distinguished style.     This album stimulates a whole gamut of different feelings and each song has a unique attitude. Despite the superior overall quality of the songs, Crystal Planet has its moments.The title song is a very strong composition and has a very solid melodic structure blended with nice drumming and bass lines. Secret prayer is one my favourite songs while bearing the most intense and mellifluous solo Joe has ever played. But the absolute favourite in this album is Time, which has already been a classic. Especially the second part of the song is utterly mesmerizing through one of the most avantgarde progressions in instrumental guitar. Until now, Satriani has never failed to launch a decent record but this one is exceptional by all means.
0684135051|1.0|I thought this book would do as it title suggests......didn't happen...still tears....no pictures to \\"show\\" you, it's like reading a really boring book. And the \\"stories\\" are to help you knit sweaters.........which still didn't help. I have only been knitting for a couple of years, but thought this book would give me some helpful advise. I would reccommend (one of my most favorite books) \\"Teach yourself Visually Knitting\\" by Sharon Turner...lots of pictures with easy to understand intructions..
B00004T9UF|5.0|If you want the same old i got riches bang bitches and kill anyone who steps to me this cd is not for you.  But for something funny and pretty interesting stories with great beats. On top of everything the best lyrically today nobody this day can even get close and nobody even try to say the real pittsburgh steeler Jay-Z.
B000002LRX|5.0|This is a strange album for me to call a classic as I've only become a Faith No More fan in the last year or two. When I first heard this there was something I immediately liked about it but still I wasn't that big on it. I liked how weird it was but I couldn't totally get into it. But after hearing this album numerous times and loving it more and more I find there's more that can be my style than I realized. If there was ever an album by a mainstream band that needed many listens to fully appreciate, this is it. Although by using the word mainstream, that's not to say this album is radio friendly. It's very different and daring after their previous album but it is still mainstream as in it's not by an underground band. I don't know what else I could possibly say about this record that hasn't been said before and probably a bunch of times. So I'll keep it short. This albums has it all. Mostly rock and metal but also some stuff I can't really classify and some softer moments but not very many. Very innovative and original and a great direction for the band to have gone after The Real Thing. One of the best and most influential rock albums of the nineties. A truly great recording.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|\\"titanic\\" finaly get the treatment it needs on this three disc set. all the extras and bonus stuff the film should have had the first time it was released.the story speaks for it's self so just know that the extras make this a joy to have and even more of a treat than it was already.
B00005JNZJ|4.0|Like many males in the Cold-War, Baby-Boom generation, I grew up reading science fiction when the best Hollywood could do was cheesy \\"Giant Ant\\" and \\"Dumb Flying Saucer\\" flicks. Closely critiquing this film misses most of the point (and the fun). Anyone past the age of reason can list this (or any) movie's shortcomings. Science fiction films deserve a looser, more sympathetic evaluation because they are attempting to do something that, when done right, is VERY difficult. The reward for considering Sci-Fi flicks by a different standard is a less tethered imagination. <br /> <br />For my money, \\"real\\" science fiction is Not a \\"cowboy flick set in outer space.\\" It's a window into what the future might actually look like. What are people thinking and doing in the future? (The farther out, the better) In thinking about what was likable about Aeon Flux, I think about how hard it is to build a sketch of the future that has BOTH a plausible and unexpected 'feel.'  <br /> <br />I know that the further into the future one goes, the harder it is to achieve this. Aeon Flux went over 400 years out! Not many films come to mind that had the courage to even attempt that. Now, imagine bringing someone from 400 years ago into our time. How much of ANYTHING would they understand?! Do you think that 400 years from now, things will have changed less, about the same, or more than they've changed in the last 400 years? I think more. Aeon Flux attempted to portray that kind of change by creating a plausible technology based on laws of physics we haven't really discovered yet. That takes guts and imagination in a medium that is risking a lot of somebody's money. <br /> <br />One of the most interesting ideas in Aeon Flux had to do with \\"perferating the vail of memory\\" that separates biological incarnations. In the whole history of human (sexual) reproduction, few have reason in their own experience to suspect they have lived in the past. Would (asexual)cloning change any of that? I can't recall a Sci-Fi flick out of Hollywood that even rubs up against this question. <br /> <br />What I liked least about Aeon Flux was that \\"human nature\\" did not appear to evolve very much. Everything was very slick and stylish, and there was a degree of freedom to move from science fiction to science fantasy, but it moved along on the same tired, predictable, adolescent crap about authority versus the rebels-without-a-clue. This begs the question of whether a film set in the future would interest us at all if we were unable to recognize the plot in terms we understand. I'd like to see less Star-Wars nonesense, and more attempts to get out on that ledge with an audience. Show me something that almost totally bewilders me but, at the same time, anchors me to a new vision of what humans could become. \\"Chimps with gadgets\\" is what we have now. Show me something different in the future.  <br /> <br />Aeon Flux has its shortcomings. So did Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Alien, Pitch Black, Dark City, and Le Jete (12 Monkeys was the far less imaginative remake). Erodite criticism in this genre is the domain of the truly boring. On the other hand, minds straining to see NEW possibilities will find much on which to chew in Aeon Flux...beats the hell out of giant ants.
B000059HAI|5.0|i first saw this film when i was 6 years old and though it was great. now that i'm older i find it even more powerful than ever and 10 times better than pearl harbor. this take on the battle follows all the missed chances to stop or at least keep the damage to a smaller level. it's thrilling even though the outcome is known and the battle it self is one of the best ever put on screen. a must own for war movies fans or history buffs.
B000002U8G|5.0|this is it, a terrific album, never gets old. I actually prefer this over DSOTM, definetly my favourite album of theirs.
B00003CXTG|4.0|i though the attack on pearl harbor was one of the best action/war scenes ever filmed. the silly story that gets you there isn't even fresh for a film made during the war. jon voight and cuba gooding jr. turn in fine if small roles. but really, couldn't they have come up with a better story than this one. just a waste

B00006L7XQ|5.0|Okay, I am not a country fan.  I actually loathe 99% of today's current country acts (trace adkins records some of the most worthless, sellout crap on the face of the earth as evidenced by \\"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\\").  My genre is hardcore/metal/progressive.  But who on God's green earth can deny Johnny Cash?  He is one of the most important figures in rock/country/overall music in history.  He has the greatest, most powerful singing voice that I have ever heard and wrote some of the most thoughtful, yet simple music to date.  He can basically do no wrong because everything he did and everything he sang he stood behind 100% and that is something that ANY music fan can respect... even us metalheads.  This album consists of 15 stellar tacks (most of which are covers)and is among the top 10 albums in my collection.  My favorite tracks are: The Man Comes Around, Hurt,I Hung My Head, and Sam Hall.  Like one reviewer said, Johnny Cash may do some cover songs on this album, but he makes them his own.  This is a GREAT album and I recommend it to anyone and everyone.  No disappointments.  Thank you to the Man in Black, Mr. Johnny Cash.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|What attracted me most to the Lynch \\"Dune\\" is how visually foreign/alien, even moody everything looks--the sets, clothing, even the gestures of the various people. One does need to know the book to grasp the movie, and I remember when I saw it in a theater people were leaving asking each other \\"What was THAT about?\\"  This was a very creative film, and it's about time we got the longer version with extras (I also liked the other Dune movies).<br /><br />Paul gradually realizes that he is a messianic figure, but I never grasped whether he understood his role as part of the will of God, or why he was chosen, and whether is his victory a good thing for the universe.  Watching Dune is a great escape, Sci-Fi at its epic best, and very thought-provoking.  Let's hope this satisfies our desires for a more generous DVD release.
B000002LQQ|4.0|On Every Street~ Dire Straits is not as great as their debute albumed and it does feel a tad too polished at times. Mark Knopfler is a great lyricist and a decent enough vocalist. My problem with this album is that it sounds a bit too much like music for the Armani wearing , vintage wine drinking upper class crowd. The music sounds so polished and at times you want to shake things up a bit more and get that rough sound that they had on their first couple of albums. Do not get me wrong, this is an album that I give four stars and tracks like on every street, calling elvis and others serve their purpose well, but it sounds like they are affraid to scare away the Armani crowd so he writes safe yet well written lyrics that somewhat lack his earlier fervor.
B000002UB3|5.0|Always been a big music fan (late thirities).  Until recently The Beatles were 'Yesterday', 'Help' and 'Hey Jude'. I've always been a Bowie fanatic and my recent buys vary from Oasis to Kaiser Chiefs, Stereophonics to Travis.  What's all the damned fuss about bloody Beatles?  So, after listening to Hunky Dory for about the thousandth time I read up on the Beatles and, hardly knowing a song from the White Album, splashed out on it big style.  Wow!  Sergeant Pepper and Revolver soon followed, and 'A day in the Life' is so stunning, readers, that if a smoke alarm was going off in my house at three in the morning and it was playing in some other room, I would still stop and listen.  I'd heard it before on a hissy tape and liked it, but lying alone with a CD the song is mind-blowing indeed. <br /> <br />So onto Abbey Road.  I first saw the zebra crossing cover as a three year old back in the early 70s.  I'd looked once or twice at the track listings as a teenager.  No titles I could just recall.  Bought it last month. Put it on.  'What the hell's this?' I thought, probably like so many others.  Couple of listens, yeah, 'Come Together' is one I've heard many times before, 'Something' too, beutiful track.  'I want you' starts to grow on me.  But the 'second side' is what most of the fuss is supposed to be about.  Why do I find it so 'just ok'? Five listens later and that 'Carry that weight' is drumming inside me, 'Such a dirty old man' from 'Mean Mister Mustard', and then suddenly I am transfixed.  I have played 'Sun King' through to 'The End' so often in the last few weeks that I'm worried the disc might become distorted in that particular region.  In short, it is some of the most stunning and magnetic music I have ever heard.  If you are of today's generation, enjoy your Arctic Monkeys and Oasis sure, but I would suggest you buy a copy of this album and let it play, as I did, over and over again.  It is stunning in every way possible and the guitar solos will knock today's greatest through the ceiling.  I have come to the conclusion that the Beatles are the finest band of all time and its taken me 37 years.  I could kick myself for being so bloody ignorant. <br /> <br />Buy Abbey Road.  Fill the bath with bubbles, and soak the darned thing into every pore.  A masterpiece in every way: cover, titles, lyrics, music.  What more is there to say?
0385338686|4.0|Anyone who has read Sophie Kinsella before knows that her books are very entertaining.  While not works of great literary fame, the characters are endearing. This book proved no different for me.  I felt like the book started out a little slow, but once the plot was developed more with more characeters, etc. it got going, and I couldn't put it down.  I enjoyed Samantha's character-she was a strong business lawyer, and easy to relate to.  I enjoyed feeling the embarrassment for her when she began her new job, as well.  This is a fun read, and won't take you long.
B0000046KM|5.0|In this unusual CD from 1992, her first CD with a full orchestra in almost thirty years, Shirley Horn teams up with composer/orchestra leader Johnny Mandel.  Horn has always sung as part of a trio, playing piano (which she considers her primary skill) to the accompaniment of Charles Ables on bass and Steve Williams on drums, and she insisted on recording the songs on this CD originally with just Ables and Williams backing her.  Mandel, adapting his own arrangements to her recordings, enhances and emphasizes her music instead of competing with it.<br /><br />As is usually the case, Horn slows down her tempo and sings quietly, sometimes even whispering the words to convey the emotion and drama of the lyrics, as the violins and violas from Mandel's orchestra add to the romance quietly in the background, often playing only chords throughout.  Most of the songs begin a capella (or nearly so) with Horn adding her piano to her voice before the song takes off.<br /><br />Three of the most interesting songs are, not surprisingly, Mandel's own songs.  \\"A Time for Love,\\" in which Horn laughs when she sings of holding hands, also features a trumpet solo by Wynton Marsalis halfway through, Marsalis playing brightly, but not brassily, in deference to the mood.  Marsalis also solos in \\"Quietly There,\\" another Mandel song in which the vibes provide accents to the unusual harmonies and disharmonies of this jazzy interpretation.  (Marsalis agreed to substitute for Miles Davis, who passed away before the CD was completed.)  \\"Where Do You Start,\\" about the breakup of a household, begins, unusually, with the full orchestra to which Horn adds her piano before beginning to sing, a song of great poignancy and sadness.<br /><br />\\"Return to Paradise\\" shows the advantages of a full orchestra over a trio, as the Latin rhythms inspire a mysterious, atmospheric background of tropical sounds--animal cries, bird song, insects as reproduced by the orchestra--before Horn's long piano solo and lyrical interpretations.  Quiet, intimate vocal interpretations, enhanced by a sensitive and self-effacing orchestra leader, create one of the most romantic and moody CDs ever recorded, and one of Horn's best albums. n Mary Whippleuiet, intimate vocal interpretations, enhanced by a sensitive and self-effacing orchestra leader, create one of the most romantic and moody CDs ever recorded, and one of Horn's best albums. n Mary Whipple
B00000K0E5|5.0|Goldeneye is the perfect bond movie. It has just the perfect ingredients,suspence,violence,decieving villians,hot women,humor,and a very good plot. Unlike some unoriginal,thrown together,simple,stupid problems like in most bond movies, this one actually makes the viewer feel watching this is important. It makes you want to watch the rest of the movie. Also for the video game nerds out there. Goldeneye wasn't just a video game that apeared out of thin air, it was based on this movie. And if you love the highly acclaimed 1st person on the N64 YOU WILL DROOL OVER THIS! I will even go as far as saying this is one of my all time favorites. So grab a buttery bowl of popcorn and enjoy!
0380789035|5.0|All the really good, intellectual stuff has already been said.<br /><br />I will just add that I picked this up at a used book store, have never read Gaiman before, and had nothing but generic expectations.<br /><br />Great book, great read, strong combination of character, mythic minutae, and story. A myth within a myth. Well done.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napolean Dynamite is so hot.  He makes Brad Pitt and George Clooney look like immature snot-nosed baby rats.  For that reason alone, you should get this movie.  Oh yeah, also because Yolanda has luscious lips.  Two reasons to get this movie.  It is so way cool.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Exciter never excited but the Angel seems dark and brooding, which is to say that Depeche Mode (DM) are back at doing what they do best, write songs that linger in your mind long after you heard them, causing mild pain and slight trauma...I love that stuff. <br /> <br />Playing The Angel is a good return to form for DM since I almost gave up on this band with Exciter. That album had 2 good songs and a pathetic rest. On the contrary, I found only two tracks on Angel irritating and out of place. Damaged People and Macro, which when deleted from this CD make it good from first to last.  <br /> <br />I like almost all the songs, although I should confess a greater liking for A Pain that I am Used To, Lillian, Suffer Wll and Darkest Star..very sad, very dark and sometimes very depressing. This is exactly why I love DM. A good CD to buy...
B000BW7QWW|2.0|This is a mixed bag from the maker of the popular Angel and Buffy series. As well as the short lived Firefly series that this was based off of.  The series I never got into.  Didn't hate it, just wasn't my type of show though I am a big fan of his other creations. <br /> <br />As a movie Firefly is ok.  It is fun, lighthearted, not overly violent or strange so it is kid friendly, and Whedon's wit still shines here and there. <br /> <br />The problems are that there are a lot of flaws in the writing and the directions that were odd for Whedon to make.   <br /> <br />The concept is nothing new.  There was a b movie in the early 90's called Oblivon that won a few indie film awards that was the same concept, sci fi western and parody.  Wild west themes also played heavily into the original Star Wars series. <br /> <br />Whedon is well renowned in Buffy and Angel for making interesting bad guys, or big bads; the Mayor, Wolfram and Hart, Spike and Drusilla, Adam.  This group however is rarely seen aside from their ninja superagent.  The other problem is that they are pretty much Britain in everything but name.  Which is a long running cliche in American movies. In an interview Kenneth Branagh commented on how America needs to let it go and stop making British villians.  If more focus had been made on it I would have accepted it as a joke.  He made similar references to good guys in Buffy, calling them white hats.  But here they are just vague references to a parliment and well refined British speaking bad guys that are an afront to the goodly salt of the earth heroes. <br /> <br />The action sequences were a dissappointment.  They were often filmed too close to see what was going on. Strange flaw for the maker of Buffy.  Mostly what you see is random images of peoples faces  <br /> <br />There was also the problem that this film offered little for those who haven't seen the show.  I reall just didn't care about the characters and for the life of me can't remember anythingspecific about any of them save the captain and young girl. <br /> <br />this movie I give four stars for my dedication to whedon and appreciation for what he has done.  but I wouldn't advise it to anyone that wasn't a fan of his or who hadn't seen the show.  Because that is pretty much what this is, a long episode of the show.  if you like that, this will be your holy grail, if not, it just passes time.   <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|I don't care what people say about the accuracy of this book. I read it before the fuss, and as a recovering addict, I can say that James Frey has truthfully depicted the struggle of being addicted.  <br /> <br />I mean, c'mon. When a book opens with a guy on a plane, unaware of how he came to be there, you have to know that you're dealing with an unreliable narrator.  <br /> <br />James Frey is a Person who Understands.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who struggles with addiction and to their family members and friends. I also recommend this book to writers everywhere, because the style of Mr. Frey's writing is so spare yet powerful. <br /> <br />
0345444051|4.0|In this alien invasion story, the aliens are peaceful and actually improve life on Earth, ending all war and hunger...which is cool and everything, but I think it's too simplistic. I don't believe that anything (let alone a friendly alien invasion) could make a \\"utopia\\" on Earth, free of war and hunger. I know this is science-FICTION, but I must say that it's just not possible.    Clarke does a great job creating suspense by keeping the Earthlings and the reader unaware of the appearance of these alien beings (they control Earth via radio from their orbiting motherships) until half-way through. For those of you who haven't read Childhood's End yet, I won't tell you what the aliens look like, but I will say that they are supposed to have first landed on Earth thousands of years ago, giving rare prehistoric on-lookers a glimpse of a popular \\"mythical\\" creature we speak of today. Clarke, you clever devil (*hint hint)!    Clarke goes on to describe in very intelligent detail the interactions between the humans and aliens, giving the story much philosophical weight towards cross-cultural relationships. The only thing that I dislike is the ending. If you've read any of my other reviews, this tends to be one of the things that bugs me the most about books...don't know why. I can't remember how it ends (I know, it's not very legit to criticize something when I can't even recall it, sorry) but I do know that I finished it feeling incomplete somehow. Clarke must have forgotten something. The title of the book implies that this alien civilization lifts mankind out of its seemingly self-destructive course up to that of more intelligence and maturity (the end of childhood *hint hint*), but you never feel like that was actually accomplished, and Clarke doesn't bother to explain why.    While I'm not satisfied enough with the book to give it a full 5-star rating, I must congratulate Mr. Clarke on a superb premise and intelligent imagination througout the story.
6305428220|3.0|The Faculty pokes fun at itself - and that's admirable. They aren't trying to make a movie like Scream; rather, they are trying to make a serious movie, but my guess is that they know they won't succeed as much as they would like to. Here's my point. Early in the film, Casey (Elijah Wood) and Stokely (Clea DuVall) are discussing Casey's beliefs that aliens are overrunning the school. Before I go any further, why jump at aliens first? There are many possibilities for what seem to be odd possessions...one that pops to mind is demonic. Anyway, Casey shares his belief with Stokely (whose character oddly pretends to be a lesbian so that people will stay away from her), and she doesn't really buy into his theory. During their discussion, they discuss The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Stokely says that the movie was simply a poorly done remake/stolen version of Robert Heinlen's Puppet Master's (I believe). In essence what the filmmakers are saying here is that their own movie is a pale imitation of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which is itself a pale imitation of something else. <br /> <br />That may mean that they knew they weren't making an A+ movie and tossed those lines in so that they could say, \\"Hey...I wasn't being completely serious, look!\\" <br /> <br />Then again, it may just be me. <br /> <br />One reviewer said that with Scream and I Know What You Did...\\", teen horror films are becoming common. That's ridiculous. Freddy and Jason movies are teen oriented, and there were perhaps seventeen films between the two of them. Those are just the \\"big\\" ones. There are plenty of smaller films looking for a teenage audience (such as the Scarecrow, which is terrible, and I don't recommend that to anyone). <br /> <br />Anyway... <br /> <br />The movie is typical for the genre, and while the main characters are cookie-cutter stereotypes, the filmmakers do make an attempt to turn some of these around. The captain of the football team decides he wants to be normal, and Casey (lesbian in hiding) is secretly in love with him (completely against her character, btw - that just didn't make any sense), and ends up being a nice little girl in a skirt and sweater by the end of the film. So they reverse two stereotypes and create another. <br /> <br />Josh Hartnet's character, Zeke, is as unbelievable as their solution to kill the monsters. He's repeating senior year because he pretends to know nothing (so we think he's the typical grunger), but he's actually just short of being a genius. He makes something akin to crystal meth in a lab at home (that, luckily, doesn't explode like the real ones when it's being torn apart), and lo and behold, the \\"meth\\" is what kills the aliens. The movie is asking us to suspend disbelief (almost impossibly done) on that. <br /> <br />Most \\"teen\\" horror films - most horror films, for that matter - have a guy and a girl fighting the big bad beastie together at the end, but this one didn't. While the ending was hardly unconventional, it was good enough to get a \\"star\\". <br /> <br />Watching this was guilty pleasure for me. I was home sick, flipping through Comcast's On Demand, and found The Faculty. There were, certainly, more intelligent films to watch, but I chose this. <br /> <br />It's difficult to review a movie by its merits when you like it even though you know shouldn't. The merits of this movie are few. Perhaps the cast made it enjoyable. This was Josh Hartnet's third film, but his first that was relatively high profile. For Elijah Wood, it was a transition film - he was making the move from a remarkably successful and quite good child actor to adult actor (at 24, we can safely call him an adult, even if he's barely taller than a hobbit &lt;wink>). It's always interesting to watch that transition, especially when it's successful. <br /> <br />Salma Hayek, of course, was nominated for an Oscor in 2002 for her supporting role in Friday. Usher - well, we all know what happened with Usher. <br /> <br/>There are more interesting notes regarding the cast (Bebe Newith, of Lilith fame, is there), but I'm tired and don't feel like tracking all of them down. &lt;grin> <br /> <br />So...final thoughts...guilty pleasure, not an original movie by any means, good acting. Tough call. <br />
B000AYEIZY|4.0|For the many classic bands that have reunited, Cream can be very appreciated for their touring. As a shortlived band, Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker always had a sensational chemistry when it came to making music, however they formed the band while not even knowing each other very well. So it is quite easy to see why they may have difficulties coping as a band. Nevertheless, in their 3 years they compiled a number of fantastic songs, ranging from fluid blues tunes to rock psychadelia. In these Royal Albert Hall concert sets, they show that they haven't lost their incredible sense of blues and rock.<br /><br />\\"I'm So Glad\\" opens with its familiar riff, and is a great extended version of the original recording. \\"Spoonful\\" is a superb blues cover originally composed by Howlin' Wolf, and the trio compiles another great performance. They stay with a blues theme in \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", which is definitely one of the most impressive performances with Clapton shining on his guitar.  \\"N.S.U.\\" is a driving force of rock energy, with great lyricism from the band. \\"Badge\\", a song composed together by The Beatles George Harrison and Clapton is a sensational song, and the performance is well done. \\"Politician\\" contains a heavy guitar riff which leaves it as probably the heaviest song in Cream's repetoire. \\"Sweet Wine\\" delivers well too, with awesome guitar work and a great vocal. The first CD closes out with \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\", a performance which I find quite superior to the recording.<br /><br />The second disc opens with some more blues, another cover song entitled \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\". Cream follows this up with what I think to be the best performance on this double album. A 7 minute extended version of \\"We're Going Wrong\\", with a powerful vocal from Bruce and a sensational guitar solo from Clapton. \\"Crossroads\\" is another strong track on the listing, however \\"White Room\\" disappoints greatly, featuring very few of the guitar hooks that were in the original recording and one of Jack Bruce's worst vocals on the album. \\"Toad\\" is a longest song on here, clocking in at 10:06, featuring a fierce drum solo from Baker, and great instrumental work from the group. Without a doubt the group's biggest hit as a band \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" comes after that epic, and is performed in a beautiful, bluesy style. To close out the second disc, their is an alternate take of \\"Sleepy Time Time\\" which is a good performance, but the song itself does not do much for me.<br /><br />Overall, the classic blues/rock trio Cream released a sensational reunion tour concert, featuring some excellent, bluesy workouts, and also having some nice rockout songs. Many of these performances are songs significantly extended from their original recording length, and this makes the double album even more worthwhile. For any fan of Cream's music, this concert is a great buy, highlighting all the best songs from Cream's career with outstanding renditions from the group.

1400032717|5.0|Reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time was a great experience on at least two levels.  Taken at face value, the book does a good job at opening a window into the mind of a young autistic boy.  As you see the world through his eyes you begin to understand the ailment and its implications both for those who have it and for the remainder of society as it interacts with them.  IF this were all the book offered it would be a worthy read and I would recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br />Haddon, however, has created an allegory for inter-personal relationships in a much more general sense.  Christopher's, the narrator, difficulties arise from his inability to understand others, particularly his inability to understand others' emotions.  As he embarks on a journey to into the world beyond the borders of his neighborhood, this cognitive limitation creates unnecessary, dangerous, and isolating distance between him and those he interacts with.  This ailment is not limited to the autistic adolescent.  His father's inability or unwillingness to trust Christopher leads to difficulties in their relationship and ultimately heartbreak for both the father and Christopher.   <br /> <br />The true take-away from this book is that all of us suffer as a result of our inability or unwillingness to get outside the rigid framework of our emotional and psychological paradigm and truly reach out to others.  This failure both isolates us and causes tragic and needless harm to us and others.  This story is a poignant allegory of the emotional distance we all suffer through as we journey through life attempting to add meaning to our lives through relationships with other people. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with the caveat that those who are particularly sensitive might take offense at some coarse language that, while neither gratuitous nor anachronistic, is nonetheless present throughout the book.
0800196341|1.0|Where does one begin in reviewing this travesty? Here is perhaps the greatest stage work in the English language on one hand; and on the other hand here is a highly overrated and overblown ego in charge of producing it on film. The result is an unmittigated disaster that would turn Shakespeare's stomach were he unfortunate enough to have survived the watching of it. <br /> <br />Let me make just a few basic points to explain. Although Branagh claims that he has filmed an \\"uncut\\" version of the play, he never really explains what he means. There are at least three important early editions of the play (1st quarto, 2nd quarto, and 1st Folio), no two of which are identical. What Branagh has done was to pick and choose bits and pieces from each, seemingly at whatever whim hit him, and patch together his own \\"uncut\\" edition. In reality, the play NEEDS cutting; in the First Folio, supposedly created from promptbooks removed from the Globe theatre when it burned down in 1613, it seems clear that Shakespeare had made several cuts and emendations from the 2nd quarto (the longest of the three major editions). Branagh might have benefited from considering Shakespeare's motives for these changes. He might also have acknowledged the cut of the one sentence that is clearly missing its completion, probably due to a copyist's error. <br /> <br />In casting this film, Branagh follows his usual practice of asking, \\"How many stars can I put in cameo roles.\\" There is little logic behind many of his choices. The most unfortunate is that he uses the great Jack Lemmon in a role that is so far from removed from even a hint of typecasting as to be ludicrous: Would you hire a 75 year old as a palace guard? Other absurdities include Gerard Depardieu as Reynaldo (Reynaldo!?!?!?) and Robin Williams as Osric. How embarrasing for such great talents to be wasted and (incidently) mis-directed in these roles. <br /> <br />I also think that Branagh's decision to show that Hamlet and Ophelia were intimate is a serious mistake. If it were at least an intelligent, thoughtful interpretive concept, I might be able to live with it -- although I doubt that it makes sense that they were actually lovers in a physical sense -- but here it is clearly extra-textual (so much for \\"uncut\\") and typically self-indulgent; is Branagh such a sex symbol that he must add a lovemaking scene to Hamlet? <br /> <br />I have to make one additional (though it's hardly the last or least) complaint. What was Branagh thinking when he set this in the 19th century? The only logic that seems apparent is that he thought it would look interesting and colorful. Certainly there is nothing peculiar to the era that supports the choice. I am certainly not opposed to playing with time and place when staging Shakespeare, but there needs to be some reasonable logic (or better, some compelling reason) for the choice. There is nothing like that here. <br /> <br />If the reader wishes to find a good version of Hamlet, there are better options: Laurence Olivier's 1948 film, though cut and now dated, is far more intersting and more meaningful. The 1964 videotaped stage production with Richard Burton, though flawed and not nearly as vibrant as actually experiencing it in the theatre was, is excessively superior. The Nicol Williamson version, also flawed, is also more interesting and far more intelligent. Finally, the overpriced BBC version (Ambrose Video) with Derek Jacobi and Patrick Stewart is a far better, more accurate and traditional (and almost uncut) production. Try one of these and skip Branagh's excercise in self-aggrandizement. <br /> <br />If I could give this film zero stars, I would; Amazon insists that I give it one or more.
1400031087|1.0|This was the worst-written book I have ever read. Run-on sentences, an apparent phobia of commas,a decision by a neophite published writer to not use quotation marks, apprently meaningless random capitalization. And people buy this buy the millions? I am reminded also of the terrible writing style of \\"Bringing Out the Dead\\", by  Joe Connelly, and of course the legendary \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" Does anybody edit this stuff? Does anybody at the publisher talk to these \\"writers\\" and explain the basics? Or do the publishers just make a decision that if it looks like it's going to sell, anything goes, they'll publish anything to make a buck. The story of this book's bestseller status is a sad commentary on the state of publishers and so-called writers in America today.  <br /> <br />Also, anyone who has actually been through rehab and done the program can see the whole thing is made up. What a farce.
B0006L0LOS|3.0|Reviled by most critics.  Winner of four Razzie awards.  A real loser, right?  Not really.  Granted, CATWOMAN is not a work of cinematic genius, nor is Halle Berry ever going to live down the fact that she made this movie after winning an Oscar.  But as far as lightweight, implausible entertainment, CATWOMAN's not really all that horrible.  It sometimes seems more like an episode of TV BATMAN, with its droll humorless humor, and it's tongue in cheek.  Just watching Berry sashay around on rooftops with that tremendous swing on her back porch is enough to classify this as camp entertainment.  Berry is joined by Benjamin Bratt as her cop boyfriend, and the delighftully catty Sharon Stone as the villainess.  It's really no worse than THE CROW or FANTASTIC FOUR; I think it got such bad reviews because we expect more from Berry?  Oh, well, I'm in the minority and that's purrrfectly okay with me.
1572814349|5.0|I love this deck. Of the many decks I posess, this one became my favorite. The collages are beautifully done, and the golden rims add to the 'this is kind of a historical and special deck' feel. It has a very nice small book too.  The imagery is based on the classic Rider Waite deck (which is one of the most used decks, lots of modern decks are based on that one), so people with knowledge of Rider Waite will have no problem reading it. But I think anyone can learn how to work with this deck.  I just love reading with this deck and like studying the images with all it's rich details and beautiful colors. It is worth buying for it's artwork alone (taking in account you like this kind of style of course)  All the images of the cards can be seen on the creator's site, goldentarot.com (since there aren't any images provided here).  I really treasure this deck, of all the decks I have (about twenty), this is my favorite. I even ordered a second one as an extra study deck. Highly recommend it.
0743454537|5.0|I, like many of the reviewers, loved this book up until the ending. I could NOT put it down and found myself getting very attached to the characters. As for the ending, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. In a way, I feel like it was gratuitous and unnecessary, again like other reviewers. But on the other hand, I feel that I took away the message that anything can happen in life...we can expect one thing and get another, and that's just the nature of things. The fact that this book was able to make me emote so strongly lets me forgive Picoult for the ending.
B0000A36J1|5.0|The extended edition of the Two Towers really helps to explain some elements that may have been confusing in the theatrical version. It is well known that this is one of the greatest movies of all time. Amazing performances by all the actors, Elijah Wood(Frodo)(my personal favorite) does a superb job portraying the pain, suffering and other emotions Frodo felt during his journey, and also amazingly easy on the eyes. Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn)is absolutely one of the best, every time he is in a scene it adds tons of interest. Orlando Bloom (Legolas), Sean Astin (Sam), Dom Monaghan (Merry), and Billy Boyd also give stunning performences.
B000002GB4|5.0|Crystal Ball marked a turning point for the band, and that was the departure of John Curulewski and the arrival of a certain young Southerner named Tommy Shaw who would help the band launch them in to superstardom. Crystal Ball, although not selling as well as their previous album, Equinox, is still an excellent album. It's a mellower album. \\"Put Me On\\" is the opening cut, with band vocal harmonies, James Young, and Dennis DeYoung sharing vocal duties. The end part, with Dennis DeYoung singing is the mellow part. Dennis DeYoung's \\"Jennifer\\" is a great piece with nice vocal harmonies, I really like the synth ending. The album's centerpiece is the title track, fully written by Tommy Shaw. It starts off almost folk-y, but then Dennis DeYoung gives us some nice synth solos to go with it. This is the cut that receives FM radio airplay. \\"Shooz\\" is a more rocking-number that you might often find on one of their early Wooden Nickel albums, while Dennis DeYoung's \\"This Old Man\\" (luckily, it's not a cover of the nursery rhyme everyone had known since kindergarten), shows Styx at their most progressive. I am in to prog rock and this band had often got a bad rap in prog rock circles, but if you're a prog rock fan and don't run at the thought of the band, I can recommend this album (as well as any of their other major label efforts up to Pieces of Eight). The band had often did the occasional cover of a classical piece, like Copland's \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" off their 1972 debut, Bach's \\"Little Fugue in G\\" off Styx II, and Handel's \\"Halleljah Choras\\" off The Serpent is Rising. This time it's a short cover of Debussy's \\"Claire de Lune\\", which then segues in to \\"Ballerina\\". To me I think the album gets a bit ignored, especially when their following was none other than The Grand Illusion, which made them from only a locally known band (the Wooden Nickel albums) to moderately selling act (their first two major label albums) to major AOR arena rock act. Regardless this is a fantastic album and if you're a Styx fan, you need this album.
B0002S94BG|1.0|When I played the remaster of Grace for the first time, I was skeptical. First of all, the album was superbly mixed and mastered before. So why would you remaster something that was already amazing? Second of all, there was no mention of who did the remastering on the album sleeve. If the re-mastering engineer did a good job, he would have given Sony hell for not giving him credit on a JEFF BUCKLEY album. So I put the CD in hoping to be pleasantly suprised. Unfortunately I was not. I think it's a sad day when people think LOUDER means SOUNDS BETTER. This version was so overcompressed that I started feeling sick halfway through Lilac Wine. My next beef is with the reverb. Now understandably, most people don't understand why you don't use reverb on a remastering job. The reason you don't do that is because whoever mastered the original ALREADY DID! You guys who liked this version should go by some Rush cds and enjoy the buzzcut audio all night long. This album was supposed to have dynamics. That means that there are supposed to be quiet parts AND loud parts. Not loud parts and LOUDER parts. The feeling and emotion is completely gone from this album. If I had anything to do with the making of the original, I would find this remastering engineer and...well...let's leave it at that.
0920668372|2.0|Allow me to preface - I am the mother of two boys, 4 and 5, who I absolutely adore.  Am I emotionally cold?  No.  In fact, we're a very open family in tune with our emotions.  (Not to suggest we sit around a campfire singing, \\"Kumbayah.\\")  This book was given to me when I gave birth to my first child. A gift.  The accompanying card told of how this book made her cry and reminded her of all the love she has for her son.  With that said, I was excited to embark on tale of mother-son relationships and unconditional love.  To my horror, I found a book filled with pages of CREEPY!  Am I exaggerating?  OK, so it doesn't get utterly creepy until the son becomes a teenager...but when it does it's undoubtedly CREEPY.  In the books defense, perhaps the illustrations make it open to such criticism.  Don't get me wrong, I understand the story's pure tale of a mother's unconditional love (I'm all for a parent's love for his/her child).  I've read this book to my children and haven't had any repeat request.  They, too, found the creeping a bit odd!  For the story's motivation alone, sans illustrations, I gave it 2 stars.  However, a mom creeping on the floor to her teenager's room?!  A mom driving in the wee hours of the night with ladder atop the car so that she can creep into adult son's home only to rock him?! I'm going to have to pass on this one...in fact, I brought the book to work today and gave it to a colleague.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album rates as one of if not my favorite, songs \\"Drive my Car\\", \\"Wait\\", and \\"Norweigan Wood\\", are good but \\"In My Life\\" stands out in my mind as an anthem of soul and pain, I could listen to it over and over.
0307276902|1.0|Long before the controversy over just how much of Frey's so called \\"Memoir\\" is fiction rather than fact, I picked the book up and gave it a shot based on the mostly stellar reviews I had read of it online.  Frey comes off as a spoiled little rich boy who is begging for sympathy through his tough guy posturing.  It comes off as a pose.  Now I understand why -- because apparently it is. <br /> <br />The prose is simply unreadable, and so friggin' meandering.  It felt like an excersize of unending sentences.  For example: I wake up and I walk to the bathroom and I throw up blood and I fall to my knees and I throw up and I throw up and I throw up and I... on and on.  And at a staggering four-hundred-plus pages, I couldn't imagine reading beyond the first one hundred which felt like four hundred alone.  It's a major pain. <br /> <br />Perhaps those who have gone through drug and alcohol treatment centers or those on the verge of doing so might find something of merit in this clunker, but I just can't imagine anyone -- the Oprah crowd specifically -- finding anything of real value, be you the literary fan or one simply looking for a good book to read, other than a headache.   <br /> <br />Skip it. <br /> <br />
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour is one of the greatest forgotten Beatles albums. Songs \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" are unbelieve songs that could speak to an entire generation. John Lennon is a lyrical master with the composition \\"I am the Walrus\\", and \\"All you need is Love\\" made it to number one on the charts.  Bottom line this is a fantastic album.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Ok, let me start by saying Opeth is THE most original and most talented heavy/death metal band in existence.  Wait can I even call them merely heavy/death metal?  Definitely not.  They add an acoustic/smooth feeling that is uncomprehensible at first when juxtaposed to the intensity that they produce.    Anyways, Opeth's newest release _Ghost Reveries_ is an epic best and most easily described with one word.  That being: MASTERPIECE.  There is quite a debate about which album is their best, whether it be _Still Life_, _Blackwater Park_.  Personally, _Ghost Reveries_ is my favorite.  Also, I love the pure harshness of _Deliverance_ and the haunting clarity and uneasiness of _Damnation_.  Actually, all Opeth albums are unsurpassible by any other band so what does it matter anyways, right?    Ok, so _Ghost Reveries_ burst into full blast right out of the gates with \\"Ghosts of Perdition\\".  Mikael ?...kerfeldt's dark growls are in full effect and scorch your ear drums as usual.  Then a great breakdown pronouncing clearly to the world: \\"Devil cracked the earthly shell foretold she was the one.  Blew hope into the room and said 'you have to live before you die young.'\\"  Great, poetic lyrics!  Sorry but I'm not going to do a track by track breakdown here.    Throughout the album there are the classic Opeth epic ballads that go on for 10+ minutes.  All being great.  The guitars are fantastically, technical as always.  Perfectly precise and killer.  The drums are fantastic, they drive everything.  Great double bass drum now and then.  And the bass is clean and supports everything very well.  Great Musicanship as always, but it wouldn't be Opeth otherwise.    This album doesn't even really need reviewed, it just needs to be bought and listened to and marvelled at.  BUY IT NOW!
0596007124|5.0|I know what you're thinking: \\"This can't be serious\\", \\"What's with the clip art\\", or maybe \\"This isn't the GoF book!\\" but dispite the silly cover, this is one of the best and most informative books on computer programming I have ever read.<br /><br />If you're looking to refine your development skills but just don't have the patience for a BS in Computer Science, this book is just the thing for you. HFIDP covers the very abstract and difficult to understand concept of Design Patterns in an engaging and fun way. By employing several different styles of teaching and visualization (including challenging questions, real world examples, and humour that isn't overly cheesy) it's nearly impossible not to learn something. There is even a section on how to retain information while reading!<br /><br />This is a Java oriented book, but I have found it to be very useful for ActionScript 2.0 programming as well.

I love that he plays more than one instrument at a time. It is great to watch him do this live. <br /> <br />An amazing tribute to their mother as well as carrying on the traditional music to the next generation. <br /> <br />Haste to the Wedding being on here makes my day..... <br /> <br />Absolutely worth the wait to finally get this in the US.
B0000A98ZP|1.0|OK in all seriousnessity...this movie has a misnomer.  It really should just be called \\"The Lunch/Snack Time Club\\" because did anyone but me catch the fact that all the significant events occurred..DURING LUNCH/SNACK TIME?? helllo! it wouldn't even qualify for the brunch club! Nice try guys..but I totally picked up on this little mistake.  Better luck next time...IF YOU EVER GET ANY FUNDING FOR ANY MORE MOVIES! <br />J/K..it wasn't too bad. but really...lunch/snack time guys..come on.

B00008GKEG|5.0|When \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" CDs started coming out it seemed like it was basically an attempt to clear out the vaults of anything that might be of passing interest to Beatles fans.  The \\"new\\" Beatles songs, \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love,\\" were okay but nothing special (what could be under the circumstances?) and while hearing the very first Beatles recording (\\"That'll Be the Day\\") is charming, the demo version of \\"No Reply,\\" the false starts of \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" and the strings only version of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are of relative value.  George Harrison's early acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is a gem, but my favorite bit was actually the bit with Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise where they do shtick with the boys (Eric keeps talking about \\"Bongo\\" playing the drums) and sing \\"Moonlight Bay.\\"  But overall we are talking about a whole lot of alternative takes that you can take or leave.<br /><br />But when you sit down to watch the eight parts of \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" DVD everything changes because, to coin a phrase, seeing is believing.  Back in November of 1995 the there were three two-hour television specials, which coincided with the releases of the first CD.  But by the time they put out this DVD set \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" had been expanded to eight episodes running just a bit short of ten hours, which is a significant increase in length.  You also get a bonus disc containing extra material to get you over the 10-hour mark.  The story begins with the birth of the boys in Liverpool and ends with \\"The End,\\" the final track from the final album.  What we have is a combination of film and audio footage from the past mixed with interviews with the (then) three surviving Beatles (John Lennon's comments come from his press interviews) and three key members of the group's inner circle: producer George Martin, roadie and Apple executive Neil Aspinall, and press representative Derek Taylor.  Restricting the talking heads to this small group creates a more intimate retrospective because we see the Beatles story from the inside with all of the perspectives from the other side being contemporaneous comments.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for rare footage of the Beatles performing, there is plenty of that here, but it is also interesting to hear what the Beatles themselves have to say in retrospect (which even John gets to do, albeit not from the perspective of today).  However, if you are looking for the definitive answers on such questions as whether or not John wrote \\"All You Need Is Love\\" for the live broadcast, forget about it, because this documentary is perfectly content to let people disagree.  Paul McCartney is the one who seems to be most aware that he is speaking for posterity, but that is hardly surprising.  This documentary really is for the long time Beatles fan, because these eight episodes do not really serve as an introduction to the history of the group.  If you do not already know who was married to whom, what Beatles songs were topping the charts, or some of the other basics, \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" will not enlighten you.<br /><br />Still, it is a fascinating look at the most important music group in history.  John can dismiss them as just being a band that broke up, but few people ever bought into that particular bit of revisionism, much as we appreciated Lennon's efforts to avoid self-aggrandizement.  Ironically what I ended up appreciating the most was how the music from the CDs came alive in the context of the documentary.  Hearing different versions of familiar Beatles songs works here because being slightly different they become new again.  Besides, this time you are not hearing track after track of alternative versions and false starts, but hearing them mixed in with archive footage and contemporary interviews.  \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" is not the definitive look at the Beatles, but it does become their version of their own story for what that is worth (which is a lot, but to be taken with those proverbial grains of salt).  You would have to be a hard-core Beatles fan to own the DVDS, but as a rule of thumb I would say that if you have all of the Beatles CDs (with or without all of the\\"Anthology\\" CDs), then you should check this out at least once.rains of salt).

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|damn ... they could've made this album so much better. It still has it's fair share of good songs but i HATE it when half the song is sad and poetic (by the SOAD i love) and then the other half just changes mood and goes to goofy. I mean ... seriously ! But this is really good advice for you guys>> if you bought this album and were dissapointed so you didn't buy the new one; Hypnotize ... then go out and get it. Cause it's really great. I mean fantastic. Such great songs. But offcourse there are goofy songs. I don't favour no.1, 7 and 10. (and 3's alright) <br />hope i helped !

Although 1, 7 and 10 are not as good as the rest, i am definately not dissapointed !! confession: everytime i hear track 12 - soldier side, i actually cry. No kidding. That song just has so much emotion and to tell you the truth ... i'm only 14 !! But this album is actual music. Not like that shiit you hear lately on alternative radio stations. It's real music. Chek it out for yourself.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|The good news is that both the theatrical and extended versions of this film are in the proper aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and from what I can tell, the extended cut is true widescreen and not just a cropped version of the 1.33:1 TV format (I have an advance copy of the DVD).<br /><br />Also, the colours are pretty good for the extra scenes, although for the most part noticeable when they're inserted into the film, but aren't as noticeable as the bootleg versions of the extended cut.<br /><br />And now for the BAD NEWS..., oh sure, it is the extended cut all right, the one from TV, you know, the one with new scenes added, and questionable scenes removed, for the over sensitive viewing audience...!!!<br /><br />Yeppers, so what we get here is the version missing the baron's psycho flight about the room, covered in what looks like oil, just before pulling the young boys heart plug...<br /><br />So, I guess I'll have to hold onto the bootleg copy of the fully UNCUT extended version of this movie (even if it is in pan and scan)<br /><br />Drats, drats, and double DRATS!!!<br /><br />Oh, and the 3 star rating is for the edited extended cut, and NOT for the movie, which I think is GREAT, being both a visual and mentally stimulating, treat for the senesce.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|<br />VERY NICE ALBUM THIS ALBUM INCLUDES ALL OF MY FAVORITES BY PHIL COLLINS. I ENJOY THIS ALBUM A LOT. THIS ALBUM INCLUDES A LOT OF HIS TRADEMARK SOLO HISTS.  I LOVE THIS WHOLE ALBUM EVERY SONG ON HERE IS GOOD. I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANY PHIL COLLINS FAN.
B000009HF2|5.0|I was 17 when this album came out, and knew of Frampton, but had never bought any of his music. A friend gave me his LP to listen to,(i still have it, I bought him the cassette in return) and I was hooked. I then attended 'Day on the Green' at the Oakland Colisium. You had to be there to understand what this album had become in 1976. I rank it as one of the top albums of the 70's, along with Rumours and Hotel California, and it was the last big thing before \\"DISCO\\" (shaking my head in shame) It's an album that you can pick up many years later, and know every word of evey song.
B00001ZULV|5.0|<br />THIS IS A GREAT CD. THIS CD CONTAINS ALL OF MY FAVORITE SONGS BY GENESIS. IT CONTAINS: INVISIBLE TOUCH, LAND OF CONFUSION, I CAN'T DANCE, HOLD ON MY HEART, TONIGHT, TONIGHT, TONIGHT, IN TOO DEEP, THAT'S ALL, AND THROWING IT ALL AWAY.I LIKE THIS ALBUM IT IS VERY GOOD, GENESIS WAS A GREAT GROUP THAT SPAWNED PETER GABRIEL AND PHIL COLLINS DYNAMIC SOLO CAREER. VERY NICE MUSIC. <br /> <br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANY PHIL COLLINS OR GENESIS FAN.
B00004R7TP|5.0|It isn't nostalgia when I say this album is a masterpiece unmatched by countless imitators (Tori Amos being the most obvious, who ISN't better looking or more talented!) My fav is still \\"The Dreaming\\", but this one is her most acessible & solid work until \\"Aerial\\". Not owning this CD is a tragedy! Get it! Worship Kate!
B000002VCO|5.0|Prime time: A nice soft rock song, sung melodically by Eric Woolfson. Similar to 'eye in the sky; but in my opinion, even better. Excellent array of acoustic guitars with some electric in places. The melody is really catchy. One of my faves on the album, this is an extremely melodic song. <br /> <br />Let me go home: A rocker. Lenny Zakatek sings lead on most of the APP rockers. He has the kind of voice that either grates or excites. This is a fairly strong effort into rock, but not a standout. <br /> <br />One good reason: I love all of Eric's vocal contributions, except this one. I find this a totally unmelodic tune, without much direction and a very bland feel to the whole song. Probably the weakest here. <br /> <br />Since the last goodbye: A beautiful ballad with Chris Rainbow on lead vocals. His voice is exceptional and pure. If you like beautiful, precise and pure ballads that have a soaring melody, this is for you. He also sings beautiful harmonies. Another stand out, I can't praise this song emough. <br /> <br />Don't tell me: Another beautiful song, crossing the path between melodic ballad and pop song. Again, Eric handles lead vocals, and  excels. I find the backing music to be beautiful and the percussive effects make me feel this is almost Christmassy in feel. Don't let that put you off, it is subtle. This just oozes melody. Exceptional, with good backing vocals. <br /> <br />Dancing on a nightwire: Colin Blunstone also has an exceptional and extremely pure voice. Prominent bass features here, with nice acoustic guitars. If you like colin's solo work, this sounds like a lot of his work. Again, this toys the line between ballad and pop song, with a bit more of a funky feel than the former track. <br />Also a really strong song. <br /> <br />You don't believe: Again Lenny Zakatek on lead. This sounds just like something off 'Eve'. Listen to 'Lie down with dogs'. I don't like the verse at all. Repetitive and tuneless. The chorus is slightly better. I was amazed a reviewer thought this was the strongest track. I just don't see it. 'Let me go home' rocked well. This falls flat on its face...but it is still listenable...just. <br /> <br />Pipeline: A beautiful instrumental. Listen to the excellent bass at the beginning. Very atmospheric and good change of chords. This is one of those instrumentals that begins with a good chord sequence, which builds and builds with loads of instruments and the orchestra. It also has enough parts to keep one interested. The saxophone parts are very soothing, played in tandem with the orchestra. Outstandingly mellow. <br /> <br />Ammonia avenue: The big progressive ballad. Eric sings beautifully and with much feeling. The lyrics are also first rate, but the melody just cannot be beaten. There is also a superb extended middle eight, as in 'silence and i', but this time, with acoustic (It may be spanish) guitar, then the build up of orchestra. Excellent piano playing also. <br /> <br />Primarily an album for those who like melodic ballads and well constructed pop songs. There is no 'I robot' here. But this album should not be criticised for not being prog. It is still a damn fine piece of writing.
0895260131|5.0|The best part of the book, is the direct comparisons of Christianity and Islam. Every American should read this book.
0670033375|1.0|Yet more out-of-date Malthusianism from Diamond. Although he has no qualifications or training whatsoever in the fields of anthropology, sociology, or archaeology, none of this prevents him from making bald assertions that would never hold up under any sort of professional inquiry. Instead, Diamond is willing to assert claims that biologists let go of in the 1950s, in order to re/create his model of biological and ecological determinism. Utter rubbish.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Dream Theater are back for their 8th studio album hence the title Octavarium.  The lineup of James LaBrie, John Myung, John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy and Jordan Rudess still remain for 8 tracks of Art Rock madness not to mention being a more keyboard driven record this time around.    Track One:  The Root Of All Evil (F).  Part 3 of Mike Portnoy's Alcholics Anonymous saga.  Sounds more polished compared to The Glass Prison (Pt 1 off Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence) and This Dying Soul (Pt 2 off Train Of Thought).  Still it's a great track opener.    Track Two:  The Answer Lies Within (G).  A slower number this time around and yet a very nice tune indeed.    Track Three:  These Walls (A).  One of my favourites off this album.  Petrucci's solo reminds me of Neal Schon's guitar playing in Journey.  But he gets no complaints from me.  Still a great track overall.    Track Four:  I Walk Beside You (B).  A ballady type number.  Still a great song if not perhaps the weakest link out of the 8.  My opinion of course.    Track Five:  Panic Attack (C).  Without a doubt the heaviest track on the album.  It's been argued that this track sounds like something from the band Muse.  Well I've never listened to Muse so I wouldn't know to be honest.  Still a great hard out rocking track from start to finish while not forgetting the intensifying instrumental section.    Track Six:  Never Enough (D).  Another one of my favourites off the album.  Gotta love that instrumental section later in the track not to mention the arpeggiated section which kinda reminds me of something the Beatles did.  Still the song is amazing.  LaBrie is excellent on this track.    Track Seven:  Sacrificed Sons (E).  A song that apparently attacks the Bush administration.  A fantastic track this is.  Beautiful chorus excellent drumming from Portnoy all of the above.    Track Eight:  Octavarium (F).  This is it.  The one you've all been waiting for.  The one true highlight on the album.  24 minutes of melodically driven, hard rocking riffagy from start to finish.  This track really has a Genesis kind of orchestral vibe even.  But that's the way I envision it anyhow.      The beginning actually reminds you of Pink Floyd's Shine On You Crazy Diamond but that's okay.  Later in the track there's a really cool section with lyrical references to classic songs and certain personalities pasted together.  For example 'Jack \\"The Ripper\\" Owens (former Judas Priest vocalist with the Owen Wilson reference moulded in) Wilson Phillips and my Suppers Ready (Genesis classic).'  Jordan later plays a killer keyboard solo followed by a hard rocking instrumental section by the entire band not to mention a little jazz section.  But the one true highlight for me is John Petrucci's heartfelt guitar solo during the closing minutes of this epic masterpiece.  It's perhaps without a doubt the most beautiful solo he's ever played since Lines In The Sand, off the Falling Into Infinity album back in 1997 or the Fading Fast solo off Explorer's Club's Age Of Impact in 1998.  The Octavarium solo very much left me in tears.  It's not often that a piece of music does this to me.  A truly moving solo indeed.  Well done JP.    And so the last note is played and makes it so that it repeats itself back to the beginning.  And you may even notice that each track is played in a certain key.  The cover at the back indicates the keys by the way.  You'll notice with the tracks I reviewed above that there are bracketed letters.  These represent the keys in which they were used.  Octave-arium.  Get it?    Best album since Scenes From A Memory?  You bet.  Fingers crossed that DT comes downunder sometime soon.  Please do.  There are many New Zealanders and Australians eagerly awaiting the day you guys set foot in Australasia.  Do come soon....
0141301139|5.0|This book was so exciting and just another wonderful work of children's literature by Dahl.  This is the third Dahl book that my 5-year-old and I have read over the course of the past year, and all of them were hard for both of us to put down.  The fox is truly fantastic and is a hero to his family and the other \\"digger\\" animals around him.  He outwits three farmers and prevails with his cleverness.  The underground adventure that the fox takes us on keeps us on the edge of our seat.  What a great story for children!
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|I would place The Strokes (though this is their 2nd album, indicating they've been around for a few), into the \\"art-rock\\" category.  Art-rock is when a band tries REALLY REALLY hard to be original and unique, but they are stuck.  What to do?  Make a torturous, abstract style of music!   <br /> <br />I have to admit, their first album was tolerable and had rhythm.  Perhaps their success got to their head, and they think they're invincible?  They make this album, which every song I've heard, and they pick \\"Juicebox\\" as their #1 hit single.  Just like when Our Lady Peace chose the worst song on their album, \\"Where are you\\" as THEIR hit single, the Strokes think that people like abstract-sounding music. <br /> <br />\\"You're so cold, you're so cold, you're so cold, you're SOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLDD!!!!!!!!!!\\" <br />\\"Everybody can see me, everybody believe me, standing in a light field, standing in a lightfield, waiting for some action, waiting for some action, *something unintelligible*\\" <br /> <br />Those are just 2 lyrics I got from listening to that rubbish.  I just can't see anyone going to a concert like that and having a moshin' good time.  In a summary, \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" teaches us that aliens truly don't know how to make good music. <br />
B000AGTPUA|4.0|Christmas time is here.  It's a time of Joy and maybe even a little pain.  It's that special time every year I give the cynic in me a little time off.  It's also the time I let myself get pulled into the movies of the season.  I'm not talking about the fodder for Oscar that permeate this time, or the stupid little comedies created to play off these high class art.  I'm talking about those movies about Christmas, the really engage and audience.  Films like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, A CHRISTMAS STORY, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, or MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS.  Films that on the surface are a little schmaltzy and silly, but have so much heart I can't stand to be pulled in.<br /><br />THE POLAR EXPRESS follows the adventure of a young boy whom has lost his faith in Santa.  He muses the question any growing boy would ask \\"Does Santa exist?\\"  When a mysterious train appears on his front lawn on Christmas Eve it whisks him away on an adventure that could take him to meet the big man himself.  Was it a dream? Does Santa really exist?  All these question will be answered in 90 minutes<br /><br />Christmas has a new movie: THE POLAR EXPRESS.  A film so sweet, and breathtaking it's hard as a critic to shower it with negatives.  Of course I could... I could tell you there are moments when the films momentum screeches to a halt, the ending goes on forever, and the tone of the movie is a little to sweet for its own good.  I also thought the needless cameo by Steven Tyler completely dragged me out of the film.<br /><br />\\"Oh look it's the guy from Areosmith,\\" I mused. It took me out of the film for a moment because I thought I was in a much cheaper film.  But I will not acknowledge those small trifles anymore.<br /><br />This film is breathtaking.  It's one fueled entirely by imagination.  The new computer imaging effects do a great job of conveying a magical aura, without drawing us into reality.  I don't believe we'll ever get to the point where a computer generated person will look human, (and that's just fine with me.)  Had the creator's of the Polar Express tried to do that it would have destroyed the look of the film.  But the characters odd movements, and almost human emotions strike the right chords.<br /><br />I loved the dancing chef's And waiter's sequence on THE POLAR EXPRESS.  It was silly and  so full of life.  I wondered if they had tried to shoot this film in live action (without green screens and body suits) what would this sequence look like.  My thought: Bad Broadway.  But the CGI characters could fly through the air, do difficult physical stunts and all without the scene feeling choppy.  This is the first big sequence and it sets you up for the even more amazing wonders to come.<br /><br />The Polar Express also takes us on an adventure in speed over and icy lake, down the steepest hill imaginable, and introduces us to characters that are both vibrant and fun.  Tom Hanks fills at least 5 roles, and gives each one their own aura.  I especially loved the vagrant Hurdy Gurdy man whom appears and disappears to help out the young hero.  The scene on ski's... I really don't want to ruin it for you.<br /><br />THE POLAR EXPRESS is high art aimed at a young audience.  If you have a heart of stone, I wouldn't recommend you waste your money here.

B000063WDH|5.0|This is a great album by a great band. The best thing to come out of Akron Ohio. This two piece band takes blues-rock to another level, with vocals that will surprise anyone listening that its a white guy. The soul of Dan A.'s voice is one that i havent heard yet.  Surprisingly, like the Stripes in less ways than one would think, and in many ways better. A truely powerful debut by an amazing band.
B000002JKA|5.0|I just don't know how else to describe this one.  Dream Theater's \\"Awake\\" is one of the very few albums I would easily describe as perfect.  I just simply cannot get enough of \\"Voices\\", \\"The Mirror\\", and \\"Scarred\\".  These select few put me in a trance every time I listen to them.  One of my most treasured CDs.
B00005ATQF|4.0|I usually can't stand war movies, but for some reason this Kubrick film was very compelling and jolting, especially the first half showcasing the USMC boot camp. The reason for that is probably because I went to see it with a group of barracks mates on leave because we had all just gotten OUT of boot camp a month before this movie came out. This made seeing it replayed right before me very surreal, particularly because we had a guy in our unit who was also a big, uncoordinated, not-so-bright goof and our company commander (this was Navy bootcamp, not Marines, and the late 80s not Vietnam era, so some things were different, but not everything) rode him all the time and had ALSO Christened him with the name \\"Gomer Pyle\\" just like the D'nofrio character. Of course, they never gave us live ammo, so he did not end up the same way.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I heard the first track from this cd on Public Radio one evening and wondered how I could have missed this Billie Holiday recording, but logic told me that it could not be Billie.  This performance of \\"Dance me to the End of Love\\" is worth the price of the cd alone, and has become one of my all time favorite songs.  Surely this is exactly how Leonard Cohen intended this song to be sung.  Track 5 is also a delight!
B000A59PMO|5.0|It takes some doing to create a series with an encompassing main storyline stretched over 22 episodes, whilst at the same time intertwining separate independent plots per episode.

This is a cheap player I've had for 2 or 3 years. Since it is a standard DVD player, I can't play the DVD-A tracks. I can, however, play the Dolby 5.1 Surround tracks and they sound very good. You can also select Dolby Stereo from the DVD menu if you want. The CD side plays with no problems in my Denon CD-changer which I've had for about 10 years.<br /><br />A warning about DualDisc: don't play in slot loading drives such as car players and some computers. The disc is thicker and may get stuck, getscratched or not play properly. My MacMini falls in that category. Fortunately, I have an external Lacie DVD burner which plays back both sides with no problems. I was also able to rip the CD side to iTunes.<br /><br />I am new to this album, but after one listen it sounds like I am really going to like it. The acoustic version of Psycho Killer is a real treat with string instruments used extensively on this amazing bonus track.
B000AY74OG|5.0|Don't believe the Disney-fed knuckleheads who've panned this movie. This movie is funny on many standards. First of all, it's made by DreamWorks Animations, and not Disney-Pixar. Since it's not Disney, you don't get the corny formulaic singing and dancing often seen in Disney animations put just to pimp soundtrack sales.<br />What you get is a cleverly written (and animated) movie that my kid absolutely loves and I enjoy along with him. Grown-ups can enjoy the pop-culture references such The Twilight Zone spoof, and Alex the Lion doing his best G-Rated impression of Charlton Heston from Planet of the Apes. If you're good with the pause button, you can also catch many subtle cookies left behind by the makers of the movie. For example, when on the ship, as the penguins are about to take over the bridge, the logo on the captain's shirt says \\"S.S. Act II\\". Why? Becuase the Act II of the movie is just starting then. Clever!

B0000399WI|5.0|Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is a non-supernatural Stephen King book.  This is a great human drama.  The film takes place at Shawshank State Prison.  The two main characters are Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins).  Andy's wife was murdered and he gets convicted of the crime but he cannot remember that night.  It is a high profile case and his conviction makes him a celebrity prisoner (which is not good.)   <br /> <br />Red takes Andy under his aged wing and shows him the ropes.  They become fast friends. But Red cannot protect Andy and he becomes fresh meat for the prisoners to abuse.  This continues until one day Andy does a favor for a guard and gets his crew a treat.  This endears him to the men. <br /> <br />Andy gets assigned to the library.  Then the guards start to see Andy for financial advice, earning him more favors.  When the librarian Brooks (James Whitmore) is paroled, we follow his attempt to adjust to outside life.   <br /> <br />Andy wants to build a proper library for the prison and after a concert effort the Brook Hatlen Memorial Library is opened.  The warden is impressed by Andy's ingenuity and asks him to help him launder his kickbacks.  This causes a problem when a new inmate tells Andy about his old cellmate that killed a banker's wife and her lover.  The warden cannot let Andy go free. <br /> <br />This is a great film about man's humanity under oppression.  Frank Darabont has crafted a masterpiece.  Morgan Freeman received his third Oscar nomination for this film and should have won.  James Whitmore once again shows what a great supporting performance is.  Once again he gets ignored at awards time for more critically favored actors in less demanding roles.  Tim Robbins has the lead role but his character is the one that everything hangs from. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B00008438V|5.0|That bar scene has got to be the most hilarious part of this movie.<br />I must have seen this 100+ times and counting. This is a must have for any 80's fan.
0307276902|2.0|Fiction or non-fiction, it doesn't matter. It was a poorly-written account of addiction. Oprah originally called the book \\"riveting\\"? I'd call it boring. I mean how many times to we have to beat this dead horse? Every addict or alcoholic that I've ever spoken with comes out of rehab, sober for the moment, thinking that they can write a book. BORRRRRRIIIINNGGG! I'll give Frey two-stars for at least finishing it. That's an accomplishment. Fortunately, his career is finished as well.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series was one of the best WWII series ever made. It shows the conflict and struggle of friends who are sometimes forced to give their lives in the event of war. Extremely accurate and compelling. The actual men of Easy Company felt that it did them justice.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|The \\"Underworld\\" franchise exists for one reason: to punch you in the face. It accomplishes this with its cold visuals and gratuitous violence and nudity. So you sit in the theater, constantly under the attack of explosions and gross-out shots and your attention is consequently held. But there is nothing in either of these films that you will remember by the time you get home. Never have I witnessed such forgettable atrocities. Behind the blood, the vampires, the werewolves, the underwhelming origin story, and of course behind the leather is nothing. These films are as soulless as the vampires they are about. <br /> <br />The lack of sentiment inspired by the \\"love\\" story is utterly inexcusable. The first movie explored the idea of a love story between Selene and the hybrid Michael. And just when I thought we were in for an interesting twist, they dropped it and didn't mention it again for the rest of the damn movie. Well, in the second installment it goes further, and fast. Before you know it there they are having sex as if that was the logical next step. I don't know about the rest of the audience, but I could have used some freakin development. And they certainly had time if not in the first film they couldve stretched it over the second. And you know what? When Michael took a fatal pole through the chest I didn't care! I felt nothing for Michael, or Selene, or the whole stupid vampire community. I'll tell you what did make me feel something: when he came back to life. Give me a break! He should've stayed dead. Or Selene should start referring to him as The One...(needless to say there were more Matrix parallels than anyone conscious for the last seven years would be happy sitting through). <br /> <br />Well let me end this rant by telling fans of Underworld to rejoice, because it is explicitly clear that yet another sequel is on the way. The final monologue by Selene was so transparent that it may as well have been someone from the studio saying \\"in summer 2007,in a theater near you...\\" Unfortunately only one example of the shoddy, shoddy writing. So, if you're in the mood for a mindless slasher, go for it.
0380977788|4.0|Let me start off this review by saying that I'll be 26 in one month and I LOVED this book!  It is written for ages 8 and up, but it is such a creative storyline that you won't even realize it.  And it is shockingly dark for being written for such young audiences.  I wish a movie based on this book was in the works!!!  You will enjoy the creative illustrations almost as much as this story.  Gaiman and McKean have a classic on their hands.  I felt my childhood imagination coming back to me!  I loved this book.  I gave it minus one star because the ending was too \\"typical\\" for me, however, there was an unexpected surprising twist that went along with it and I can't be too hard on this book because it was written for 8 year olds :)
0740748475|5.0|One of the best daily comic strips of all time, an enjoyable set that all can read from child to adult.  Highly recommend.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Somerset Maugham liked to characterize himself as a good writer of the second rank.  Much the same can be said of Truman Capote, with the caveat that he wrote one book of the first rank, his astonishing nonfiction novel IN COLD BLOOD.  This marvelous film tells the story of the writing of that book and reiterates the theory of one of Capote's most prominent biographers that the writing of that book was not merely the culmination of his career, but the cause of his decline as a writer and his descent into alcoholism.  The past few years has seen an explosion of biopics, but by any standard this has to stand as one of the very finest, and perhaps even the best.<br /><br />Whatever other merits this film has-and it has many-first and foremost is the incarnation of Truman Capote in the performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Almost every year going into Oscar season we see at least one performance that so completely overwhelms all of the others it seems inconceivable that that performance will not win the Oscar.  Last year that performance was Imelda Staunton in VERA DRAKE.  This year that performance is Hoffman in CAPOTE.  No performance in 2005 by either a male or female came anywhere near the job that Hoffman did here.  What is astonishing is not merely that Hoffman did such a magnificent job of imitating Capote's voice and mannerisms that he seems to be channeling rather than impersonating him but that within that imitation he delivered a performance of enormous subtlety and emotional range.  In other words, this performance truly is more about acting than about imitation, though the imitation is impeccable, despite the fact that Hoffman is far too tall for the role (but, then, Peter O'Toole was about a foot too tall to play the diminutive T. E. Lawrence in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA).  Hoffman's performance is so dominating and so remarkable that it alone would have been sufficient to guarantee the film's success, but luckily he is far from the only good thing in the film.<br /><br />This film, which has been widely reported as having been shot in slightly more than a month, is remarkable on almost every level.  The period look is impeccable from the dress to the d&eacute;cor of rooms.  Every aspect of the production is first rate, but what really shines is the superb cast, which is populated with a host of great character actors.  Apart from Hoffman no one performer stands out, but that is more a testimony to the overall excellence of the cast than the failure of any actor.  Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener (a great beauty who glams down in this one as Capote's close friend Harper Lee-the odd kid in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was modeled on Lee's childhood friend Truman--showing that she is going in middle age going to be one of our most versatile actresses), Bruce Greenwood (as Jack Dunphy), Bob Balaban, and Mark Pellegrino all perform marvelously in a very strong cast.  Clifton Collins Jr., an actor I previously knew only from several appearances on the television show ALIAS, was very good in the key role of Perry Smith, one of the two murderers with whom Capote somewhat identified and who he both befriended and exploited in writing his book.<br /><br />The story, of course, revolves around Capote's investigation of the horrific murder of a well liked and important family in a small town in Kansas.  Each of the victims had been bound and shot in the head with a shot gun.  After a police hunt two young men, Perry Smith and Richard Hickcock, were arrested for the crime.  They were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death.  During the proceedings Capote, who was covering the murders for the New Yorker, befriended Smith, who has a background similar to Capote's own.  The film is superb at showing the complexity of human motivation, how Capote both truly likes Smith and yet exploits him shamelessly while also being repulsed by him.  The cold-blooded manner in which Capote both exhibits tremendous compassion for Smith and lies to him aboutthe state of his book is almost as scary as the murder that Smith commits in flashback.  Smith repeatedly asks Capote about how much he has written and what the title of the book will be and is told that he has made little progress on his untitled work.  In fact, Capote has nearly finished the book, largely waiting to find out whether Smith and Hickcock will succeed on their appeals of their death sentence, and very early on settled on the title.  A mark of how good the movie is comes when how tortured Capote is shown to be by his exploitation of Smith.  At the end his guilt drives him to agree to witness Smith's hanging.  The story from beginning to end is both riveting and horrifying.  I kept thinking of how the title of Capote's great book could be applied to almost every aspect of the entire story.<br /><br />I would highly recommend anyone who has seen this film but has not yet read IN COLD BLOOD to do so as soon as possible.  This truly is one of the most marvelously written books in the past half century.  The prose is as exquisite as any written in English during that period, with the nightmarish, harrowing murders portrayed as coldly and dispassionately as they were committed.  Throughout Capote distances himself from his subject matter and although to any attentive reader it becomes obvious that he has inside knowledge of many of the events in the book, he does not appear in any guise whatsoever.  If one knows nothing about Capote's involvement with Smith and Hickcock, as I did when I first read the book, it is clear that at the very least he conducted extensive interviews with everyone associated with the case.  Knowing how deeply involved Capote actually was makes his utter absence in the book especially eery.  IN COLD BLOOD is one of the finest American books of the past century and this fine film will hopefully be watched in conjunction with it in the future.  I will close by adding that while IN COLD BLOOD was made into a superb film (starring Robert Blake as Perry Smith), I think CAPOTE is an even better film.  I cannot recommend either the book or the movie more highly.the state of his book is almost as scary as the murder that Smith commits in flashback.

B00009Z574|5.0|Unfairly maligned and spit upon by weird old Yes fans, Tormato is in need of a second opinion a quarter of a century after the fact. This collection of songs is (of course) not as good as CTTE, Relayer, or Going For the One - but those are the band's best albums... how could it be?  For my money it's better than Drama and full of worthy songs in the Yes catalog. Future Times is catchy and deep enough, Don't Kill the Whale, though dated is still a nice little groovy number and Release Release rolls along unrelentingly much in contrast with the soothing Madrigal and Onward.<br /><br />It might take a second or third spin to \\"get it\\" like any Yes album, but it's not unworthy and it's both better than it's reputation and almost everything that has been release released since.<br /><br />ha!
B00000099Y|5.0|I will admit, I listen to a plethora of musical genres... and metal music is not one of my favorites. However, Tool and A Perfect Circle have a certain charm about them- a classic sound that, despite the claims otherwise, is unique to them. I listened to this album when it first came out when a friend of mine going through a Marilyn Manson / Nine Inch Nails phase reccomended them to me. I was in middle school at the time and found the music a bit shocking and unusual, something I would listen to with friends but would't want to own myself. Time has worked wonders on this album and many of Tool's cds... I now have more of an understanding of the music and respect it as a fabulous creation. After I graduated high school, I re-evaluated my musical tastes, and Tool was one of the bands that made the cut. I appreciate the chaotic sound- it changes but stays so rythmic and entrancing at the same time. This album is a great one to just put on when you need to arouse your emotions, it is great for a plane ride, a long trip, or as background music when hanging out with friends. On the other hand, it is perfect for wailing along to when driving in the car. I appreciate the time and skill put into it, and I hate that many people are not able to understand the reasoning behind the \\"so-called\\" monotonous sound.  Many artists create a cd to be an ongoing story- not all bands are out to create a vivid array of instant top 10 hits. This album sets a mood- follows a theme- and in doing that, you hear many songs with the same sound and feel, and I think they accomplished what they set out to beautifully. This cd is not for everyone- it is passionate and that doesn't mean I believe some people are unable to \\"get it\\", but that this type of music takes a certain amount of understanding and appreciationg that not everyone has for most 90's music, especially not more \\"edgy\\" stuff. Tool made an effort to make their lyrics a bit more \\"smart\\" and intelligent; to some people it makes them come off as precosious or forced. The more you listen to Tool, the more you like the music. If you don't like it after many listens-through, then obviously this is just not your cup of tea, don't bash it just because you aren't interested in it. To all of you \\"OMG'ers\\"- please try to expand your musical tastes, do not just like this band because all of your friends have Tool t-shirts and you are expected to love them. You wouldn't believe how similar the messages and feelings that you absorb from metal bands etc. are portrayed in other genres of music, and just because you have an indie cd or a country cd or even a rap cd doesn't mean that you are any less \\"cool\\". Music evolves and the people who listen to it need to appreciate all types, you guys know you would be sad if your dog died or your girl broke up with you so stop bashing songs that tell it like you feel it just because you feel social pressure to! *endrant*
B00000F169|4.0|You must keep in mind the fact that this move PREceded Star Wars. For that fact alone it is significant. There are simply some classic scenes in Dark Star as well as some hilarious ones. <br /> <br />Yes it is somewhat cheesy by today's standards and the effects certainly look terrible today but the movie had some depth to it and at least attempted to get you to think. <br /> <br />If you like sci-fi or just a little irreverence and can get past the old effects it is still a classic movie.
0307276902|5.0|ANYONE WHO CAN PULL ONE ON OPRAH IS TOP NOTCH WITH ME. <br />GO MAN GO!
0307276902|4.0|Okay, so you begin to read the book and you become a bit enthralled when reading compelling portions of it, until you realize that every thing you read may, or may not, be true.   <br /> <br />I get the whole \\"embellishment\\" thing, but to what extent?   <br /> <br />I bought this book after seeing the encore presentation of Oprah's show where she first introduced the author into her book club, had him on the show, talked about his life and showed several testimonials.  I became very intrigued and went out and bought the book right away. <br /> <br />A week later, the s**t hit the fan.  He's on Larry King, the Smoking Gun, all over the place about how a lot of the facts in the book have been embellished, but that the controversy is only over a couple of pages in the book and that's it, as opposed to the other 420 pages.  And even Oprah backed him up. <br /> <br />But from then on I began to put two and two together and read what some other people did, which was a million little lies. <br /> <br />His character (which he now admits it is) is this badass annoying guy who's stubborn and stares every one down.  That got a little annoying.   <br /> <br />However, if you read this at face value, and I recommend you do, you might enjoy it.  The writing itself gets a bit bothersome after a while because of the lack of punctuation, but you push through it.   <br /> <br />If you buy this book, just think of it as fiction, and nothing more.  It's nothing more than the product of the author's imagination; a good product.
0440178002|5.0|When I first looked at this book its length caused me to put it down.  Then a good friend of mine told me to \\"read the first two chapters.\\"  I did.  I was hooked. <br /> <br />Sho-Gun is a book that gave me good reason to finish work and get back home and read; I would read late into the night until I was finished.  It's a captivating story about politics, people, relationships, history and cultural and religious clashes at their best.  <br /> <br />I have recommended this book to several avid readers.  Each one has thanked me for the recommendation.  Need I say more?
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|so, i've seen other reviews of this album. some from critics, some from listeners. it seems to me that this band has had nothing but Sh*t thrown at it from the get-go. i can only think someone would do this for one reason: because the band is fronted by actor Jared Leto. first off, this is a stupid reason to give this album a bad review...or the band a bad review in general. no one seems to be looking at the music here. second off, this truly is an amazingly, talented band. the lyrics, the guitar, the drums, everything you would want in a great album is here. just because the band is fronted by an actor doesn't mean these guys should not be taken seriously...they truly are a force to be reckoned with among many bands today. songs like \\"Beautiful Lie\\" are better than anything i've heard lurking on the airwaves lately. the album itself is beautiful.jared leto truly is a great singer...his voice is very distinct and he carries his own against some of the greatest singers out there today. it's heavy, but not too heavy. soft, but not too soft...nothing is overdrawn..nothing is overdone...everything is as it should be. it's not an entirely perfect album either...but, of course, there is no such thing. some of the songs...maybe only one or two...do feel somewhat lacking, but it doesnt keep you from enjoying the album. outstanding tracks on this album are: <br /> <br />Beautiful Lie <br />The Kill <br />Was it a Dream? <br />R-Evolve <br /> <br />so, before you judge this album simply because it's an \\"actor's vanity project\\", think twice. you won't be dissapointed.
