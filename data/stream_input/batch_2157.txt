B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love everything that he writes and I really love that he keeps it so clean. Now that I am done with the book I can't wait to see the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect simple and understandable calculator. It's hassle-free and works perfectly. No complaints at all. Quick and easy to use !
B009UX2YAC|1.0|everything was working fine until one time I got back on my kindle fire to play and notice the score was 0 and it was back on the default character taking me through the tutorial mode.  really disappointed it lost all of my game data.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought the game was alright. After playing it for a hour, I began to enjoy the game more. Great game for everyone.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I'M FURIOUS !  I really liked the Kindle 3 chapter Sample, BUT either Simon & Shister or Mr. Stone required Amazon to DISABLE Speech.  Why?  It is a 700+ page book, why can't we listen to part of it on our Kindle.  I want to listen when I drive and read when I am at home, maybe listen a bit while I wash dishes. Why?  Almost no other Publisher Disables Speech.  $13+ for a digital book, should allow them to allow Speech.  And they have not way of email them directly.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The best show on tv! I didn't think I was going to be able to catch up on my lost episodes...thank you Amazon! Great quality!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great follow up to the GWDT.  I enjoyed this book better than GWDT because most of the characters were in place and there were not as many.  Great series.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Just one of those movies I grew up with. I bought to have my kids watch it. Now we all love it.<br /><br />Shane
0805083367|5.0|Although we purchased a used book (one that was worse than the condition stated) my boys don't seem to mind.  This book is very easy to read and is suitable for all ages.  I have a 2 and 5 year old and both are just as interested in this book.  I am asked multiple times a day to read this.  Like any of eric carle books, art is simple and unique.  We own a few  others from his collections and this one holds up to the rest.  This is a must in any little ones collection!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I wish I had never read the misleading review, this book has no redeeming qualities. The characters are not believable.
B006LSZECO|3.0|First half of the book was very good. However the second half took a turn that I felt did not fit the characters or the character POV.  I also found the ending very unsatisfying.  That said, the author is a very good writer and the book is worth reading.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Clever lyrics, great tunes, beautiful voices.<br /><br />Cheerful, sing-along-at-the-top-of-your-lungs music.<br /><br />Makes you feel young again music.<br /><br />Great quality recording from a group that should still be recording.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I picked this up because I LOVED Slaughterhouse Five quite a bit. While this book shares a lot of the style, the narration is a little off to me. Vonnegut doesn't write characters who are good or evil and he does a lot of foreshadowing. In this book, it almost seemed like some of the foreshadowing fell a little flat and the people were not as likeable. The book is still a fascinating read, more correctly classified as a Vonnegut but not poorly placed as sci-fi. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I loved some of his other work.
B000002LCB|5.0|Beautiful soundtrack for this beautiful movie. My previous CD mysteriously disappeared and this replacement has brought me a lot of enjoyment again.
B0085LMFAE|4.0|This album has some of his best hit songs in one album.  A classic!  Paul Simon at some of his best moments.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|I am not a John Wayne fan. (Thank goodness my real name is not revealed here!) That said, I do like this movie. I remember seeing it as teenager or young adult, and finding the romantic interplay between Mr. Wayne and Ms. Sullivan to be delightful.<br /><br />It is dated, and not a movie anyone under 50 would probably like (but what do I know?)  This was an excellent quality recording and a delightful way to spend a little time reminising.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|I had this album on vinyl, so had to have it on CD.  I like the bonus tracks as well.
B001KOFH2G|3.0|If you loved the show, you definitely has to watch this! It's not as good as the show but it does a decent job.
B00000342V|5.0|This has got to be one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time, and getting the whole deluxe edition package makes it even better.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Went in a little skeptical, thought it would come off preachy. But it is a very interesting movie, and one of the best of the year.
B003W77SA8|5.0|This is one of ELO's finest albums, and having it on CD with the bonus tracks is just as great, although I do miss the this side and other side I had with the vinyl copy.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best television shows out there, it's a shame that it was canceled after one season. I highly recommend a watch!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a handy little thing and it serves its purpose well. Like a couple of other reviewers here, mine came with a bit of rust on the carbide side but that's not a huge deal since I'm not planning on using it on kitchen tools. Even if I were planning to, I'm sure that I could clean them afterward to remove any lingering traces of rust from the knives. The instructions say that you can replace the blades, but the pocket pal does not come with any replacements. At least one set of replacement blades, for each side, would have been welcome in the package; but you can't have everything. I would probably give this a 4.5 but, at this price, my minor complaints don't seem worth a markdown. This thing should last a while, and buying a replacement would be cheap enough. I'll probably buy this again at some point. Might even gift it to some people, if I feel it is appropriate.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|One of the best in it's genre if not the best. It leaves you with actual feels and new ideas and opinions. Check it out.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|These are my overall impressions. I haven't read the books in awhile, so take that into account.<br />First, it should be obvious that you really need to either have seen season one or read the first book before watching this season.<br /><br />I didn't think this season was that much worse than season one. However, there is a decline in the quality of the acting simply because we lost two great actors in season one and the several new actors don't measure up:<br />Boring new actors: those playing the roles of Stannis and \\"Yara\\"(Asha).<br />Okay new actors: those playing the roles of Margery Tyrell, Davos, Melisandre, Balon Greyjoy (Theon's father), Craster, Talisa (a character invented for the show, Robb's love interest this season - takes the place of Jeyne Westerling), Jaqen, Ygritte, Xaro, Brienne (is she only 6' 3\\"? They make her look 7 feet tall), Pyat Pree<br />Outstanding new actors: none<br /><br />I didn't have any major problems with the actors of season one, only how their characters were written (for example, Cersei was too nice in season one. She gets meaner in this season.)<br />Littlefinger - almost too nasty this season. Well, alright, season one firmly established him as one of the bad guys.<br />Theon - People who haven't read the books will be confused by him. In season one, he appeared to be completely loyal to the Starks. Now, he is shown to be otherwise. I've read 4 out of 5 of the books at least twice each and still don't get his character. Does \\"selfish traitor\\" cover it, or is there more to him?<br />Jorah Mormont- looking too old to be a potenetial love interest for Dany.<br />Old Man Mormont on the Wall - not as respectable as in the books.<br />Pycelle - the writers messed up the \\"manhood\\" joke.<br />Arya - too old to pass for a boy.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted the various discrepancies between the novels and the series. These may not be large enough to damage the story, but since we don't have the entire story yet, it's too early to tell.<br /><br />Features on the 5 Bluray discs<br />(I haven't gone through all of these, so my advise is to avoid them until you've seen the episodes, to avoid spoilers.)<br />-19 \\"animated\\" (motion comic style) history clips-these are about 2-5 minutes long and are told from the viewpoint of individuals characters, with their biases. This helps give the viewers who haven't read the books (or those of us who need a refresher) a lot of back history that they couldn't cram into the episodes. To unlock these, you have to play the episode through; if you fast-forward through the episode you won't be able to watch them. This feature is part of the<br />-an In Episode guide, which also gives you brief descriptions of the characters in the scene you're watching, as well as showing where (on a tiny map) the scene is taking place.<br />-War of the Five Kings- an interactive guide to the ins and outs of the war<br />-Hidden \\"Dragon\\" eggs- So far, four of these have been discovered- each containing a deleted scene<br />-12 commentaries<br />-The Religions of Westeros- Martin and the writers discuss these for 7 1/2 minutes<br />-Game of Thrones Inner Circle- roundtable discussion between 4 of the actors, Benioff, and Weiss<br />-Creating the Battle of Blackwater Bay-<br />-History and Lore- the 19 animated history clips all in one place<br /><br />Features on the 2 double-sided DVD discs<br />-None. All the special features in this set are on the Bluray discs.<br /><br />Also included: A fold-out map showing the ENTIRE Game of Thrones world.<br />-A digital copy authorization code.<br /><br />And, if you buy the set from the same massive chain store I did, it comes with an additional disc with one 20 minute clip on the special effects<br /><br />There's a scary little slip of paper that warns that there may be playing issues if your Bluray firmware hasn't been updated, but so far I haven't had any problems, except for the amount of time it takes for the disc to start playing.laying.
B004KA9UX4|5.0|As a jazz theory illiterate, I was lucky enough to play with a horn/piano player who knew jazz theory like an idiot savant -- he played piano for Don Cherry -- but was patient like a kindergarden teacher.<br /><br />Mark Levine has all of the insights you can get from such a person, but they're in book form. That means if you don't \\"get\\" what sensei just said, you can re-read, practice the examples and build your knowledge.<br /><br />Further, Mark has organized the material so that it builds nicely from basic to advanced. Throughout, he adds personal anecdotes and critical insights about major players and their approach that make the book a fascinating read.<br /><br />Mark makes no claim that his material will perform miracles. He makes it clear both directly and indirectly that you, the reader, need to make a huge investment in practice to play jazz properly.<br /><br />I think I can speak for the folks who play jazz \\"by ear\\" (Although I'm not any where near the level of Wes Montgomery) because that's how I came to jazz. This book explains what you're doing when you \\"get lucky\\" and play a magical solo. More importantly, it tells you how to escape the more common mediocre \\"noodling\\" that comes from not knowing the theory. It gives you the musical abstractions that will elevate your playing by replacing brute force with intelligence.<br /><br />Finally, I love that Mark clearly appreciates the jazz of the 60's and beyond. He's clearly a fan of Shorter, Henderson, Hancock and Shaw, which are favs of mine as well. Since I aspire to play some of what they do, this further inspires me to both read and work through Mark's book.<br /><br />To paraphrase Morpheus from the Matrix, \\"This book is \\"the one!\\"\\"
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another excellent Reacher book from Lee Childs.  Can't wait for the next one.  He never fails to excite his readers.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|This is classic and very heartfelt Capton blues -- this is a well-recorded concert and a must have for any EC fan
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love playing this game. It is very relaxing after a day at school. My Grandson is learning to play it also. I recomend anyone who like solitary to try Spider.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Best Show ever!<br /><br />I love this Series.  It has everything, suspense, drama and comedy.  I cannot wait for next season to be released.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I am not a band wagon fan. I have been following this artist for quite some time, not to sound pretentious. To be honest his other albums were decent, but this blows it away. This is easily one of the best albums of the year, and that's strictly from a musical standpoint. The instrumentals are new,refreshing, and well produced. This album is non stop hits and i highly recommend it to anybody. Lyrically the album refreshing with a good mix of uplifting and fun wordplay. Not to mention Macklemore is the only independent to reach #1 in the billboard charts. Also the fact that he has a song showing how much record labels pimp their artists. Support independent artists/Seattle and purchase this album. I'm a proud Seattleite and highly endorse this album. If you like Macklemore definitely YouTube his song \\"the town.\\"
0446693804|1.0|I really expected more from this author as so many movies have been based on his works.  I never quite got reeled in and it seemed more like a novel for teenagers, not adults.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|This book had me rushing to try to get to the end to find out what happened, to slowing down and not wanting it to end because I was enjoying it so much!<br /><br />The characters were vivid, realistic, believable. The story was gripping and while fantastical, it was certainly credible. The &#34;story within a story&#34; was handled well - so often it isn't.<br /><br />Murakami is never easy to read, but I found this story so gripping, that the world he created was easy to get submerged in.<br />(I will review Book 3 next, but I have to say I was disappointed by it - I found it made the story too long, but I had to read it to reach the conclusion.)
B0098G67TU|5.0|Having this blueray is like seeing the movie for the first time all over. This being my favorite movie I was not sure if they could impress me, but they did! I would recommend this to any true fan. Even if you own a previous version this is well worth it.
B005EWDA3I|3.0|You have to read Book 3 after Books 1 and 2, because it is one story that would otherwise be without an ending, but for me, the third book was disappointing. I felt it made the story that I was so taken with in the previous books, drag on too long. It didn't hold my attention as the others had.<br /><br />But Murakami did complete the story neatly and I was satisfied with the ending.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I bought this for my 1 1/2 yr old daughter. shes getting more into watching movies now and ive been trying to get her ones with lots of music and/or dancing and she loves this movie because it has just that. She says &#34;Birdie!&#34; all the time while watching it and dances to the music, its so adorable. The movie itself is very cute and fun for all ages to watch.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Jodi Picoult makes for easy reading of difficult subjects. The Pact is no different: two teenagers are found late one night, one dead and the other alive and unharmed. A suicide pact is the obvious explanation to many people, until the survivor, Chris, is charged with the murder of his girlfriend, Emily.<br /><br />The story tells both the history of their relationship, as well as what happens in the present, with Chris's experiences in jail, during the trial, and how both his family and Emily's family deal with the tragedy.<br /><br />As with many Picoult books, the reader is left guessing right until the end, and this suspense is elegantly handled.<br /><br />My complaint about the book is that some loose ends are not dealt with - without giving anything away, Emily's mother finds a piece of evidence that may or may not have a huge impact on the trial, but then nothing happens with that object. I also felt that the relationships between the members of both families were unresolved.<br /><br />I felt that Picoult describes the overwhelming sadness and fear that Emily felt before her death very realistically.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I wasnt sure if this was going to turn out as funny as i heard it was but it did not disappoint! I was laughing sooo much and quote lines from the movie all the time now. It may not be the deepest plot ever but it is a fun movie to kickback and watch for some good laughs.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|I love this movie and have since it came out, now I can share my love of Hercules with my sons. I love that I can also stream it on my tablet so we can watch it on the go. (Granted we go places with wifi)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great app that is very challenging and, like the first, relaxing. this one seems to be a bit more difficult than the first bit that is a good thing. can't wait for Memento to come out! great job on the apps
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is great for taking your mind off things and you can play as different characters.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|good movie for family!  Somebody in my household keeps 'borrowing' my copy, so I had to order another one.<br />Obviously everyone else love it too... LOL
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is pure fun if you just want to kill some time this game is perfect for those with a little spare time. The game is easy to play so it's good for all ages. It is definitely a step up from Temple Run 1 better graphics, better game play, more obstacles and a lot more interactive. I recommend this game to anyone who liked the first one as well as those who love face paced reaction games.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|the beginning was a little slow but as it progressed it held your interest.  the technical aspect seemed very current and informative.  not one of the monsters and unbelievable things one can encounter.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing! I cannot believe how well written it is and how much I feel Auggie's emotions and feelings. I wish there was a sequel or movie to this wonderous book!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I am unsure as to why everyone has such bad reviews of this product, they must be using it wrong.<br /><br />I bought this adapter 2 years ago when I bought my iMac.  I bought it alongside a 50 foot HDMI cable, I have the iMac attached to my living room TV 24/7, I stream netflix and other videos I find online to my TV whenever I feel the need to.  I do not move the cord or disconnect the cable ever.  So far I have had no problems, no incidents whatsoever.  The adapter works perfect, it has a solid construction with a mixture of plastic and aluminum.  Please do not believe the other commentators, this is a great product.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|This app is a great idea although I do wish that when you draw you view it with your writing and I wish you could actually drag pictures on to your pages. It would be more like a notebook if you could write draw and paste pictures all on the same area
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Non stop page turner. You will laugh get angry you will dollar and cry. This book makes you feel alive in it and go through all the emotions. So sit back and get ready for the ride.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved this book!! It kept me awake at night trying to think what would happen next, or how it was going end. I recommend this book to someone who is looking for a book about love but with a twist that it sometimes doesn't always last.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I'm only into the second eipisode of the season but so far so good.  It's very entertaining and the plots are very clever.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|a challenge and fast paced.  would recommend the game.  I have my gradchildren hooked and they play on their units when not here.  Would recommend it.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|The movie is good and entertaining and terrible in outcome. Schwarzenegger is at his best in one of the old hits of the ninety's.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I couldn't figure this game out and quickly dismissed it.  will go back and try again see if it holds my interest
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I thought it was excellent!! It was one of those books that I couldn't put down. I loved that it wasn't predictable, and kept me guessing. Very well written, and truly felt connected and invested in the characters. I also appreciated that it dealt with the sensitive subject of mental illness, and portrayed how family members and friends deal with someone in their life that is struggling with a mental illness.  What it isn't is your typical love story, which might be why I enjoyed it so much.  I
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I enjoyed the fast pace and challenge of the game but now that I finished all themwhat is the next level or is there one
B002VUFKG6|5.0|If you are getting married or divorced you need to read this book.  I am glad she had a happy ending
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book had a lot of suspense and I could`t put it down. The whole plot was good. I think any mature reader would like this book.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I read it over for a second time.  First time I read it I was rushing to get to the ending.  Second time I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything.  pmn
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ<br /><br />I love it so much a wanted to marry it<br /><br />It was the best action packed book l have ever read
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|our future as citizens under Obama Rule.  Hunger, pain and suffering will all be ours under socialism and complete ruin.
B002MRROKS|5.0|As for Nirvana live performances this is it. All fans wish that there were a whole lot more high-quality live concert performances out there but such is not the case. Very happy to have this document.
0061950726|5.0|This is a very well-written historical fiction. It moves between 1920 and present day revealing more of the characters backgrounds with each chapter. Two main characters are Vivian and Molly, people who at first glance could not be more different from each other but once we get to know them we discover how alike they really are. Vivian story is set mainly in the past in 1920 and deals with the orphan train and several other difficult subjects (horrible family situations- think THE WORST). Molly's story is mainly in the present and intertwines with Vivians seamlessly. It is very easy to fall in love with this book and the characters. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes more modern historical fiction as well as those who like stories about overcoming the odds.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Honestly, this has to be the worst book I've read in a long long time.  Very poorly written, terribly weak characters, and the plot?? well there is no plot, actually. Author had a great idea. Why don't I write about sex masters and subs? Great idea, it worked, I got caught too, and author made a fortune (i'm happy for her). Except that she can't write at all. Clich&eacute;s and repetitive expressions are all over (how many times must a person 'purse' his lips before we imagine the picture??) and make the reading extremely annoying. I made it to the half of the second book and couldn't stand it any more.<br />Gosh. You are insulting your readers. I feel betrayed. But heck, you got my $$$ so I guess that's what it's about.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I chose the rating because I'm in Love with the main character!  I liked her moves, and everyones moves pretty much, it has good music/beats. But I gotta say Bianca a damn Hotty, and pretty much loved the whole setting and storyline, good job with the writing for this movie, way better than the 1st Step Up. It's more inspirational, and will be watching it for a long time. I would recommend this Movie to pretty much everyone in their 30's and younger.
1427210241|5.0|This was the most satisfying ending I have read in a long time.  I borrowed the audiobook from my local library and loved it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Don't usually like this genre but loving this game. Deeper than expected. Find' t even know I could buy in-game content. No need. The game fills my 90 minutes of commuting each day.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was a fantastic show.  I am sorry that I have not watched it on TV but this was the next best thing!!  I loved it and can't wait to get the 3rd season!!!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|My kids fight over who gets too play.  I enjoy the game also.  Fun to figuire out how to unlock each level.  It would be nice if you could list each player so we could work it out by ourselves.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|Really good, heart warming movie!! The actress who plays Rick's girlfriend (Sugar) at the end is phenomenal!!!!!! And the robots are pretty cool too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn does it again, but the storyline surpasses any of the other Mitch Rapp exploits. When his injury from the explosion leaves him with memory loss, Irene worries how much of it will return and when.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I have a friend going through this with his wife and I wanted to read what SHE might be experiencing as they navigate this awful disease together.  It has given me some insight and at some point, I will recommend it to him.  If you are finding yourself the caretaker for a family member or friend who has been diagnosed, this book just may help you have more patience dealing with the idiosyncrasies of someone who disappears from you a little more each day.
B005LAII12|4.0|The movie is good and will be entertaining to almost anyone. I chose to give it a four rating because I did not totally like the movie but I thought it was still pretty good,
B007PTJOV0|5.0|resly good game i got it on my i pod first and finshed it the first night it was so good
0151009554|5.0|The book was good. I did not like the extra writing stuff inside of it. Other than that it was good.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen. A true story of redemption for a fascinating man. It is just as they mention in the film, a story so incredible that it is hard to believe. This is a film for all of the dreamers who never received their moment in the sun. Through the hard work and dedication of a few good people, a star is re-born. Rodriguez has a new fan in me. I will buy the DVD and all of his CD's. There is no way to ignore the power of Searching for Sugar Man. Thank you!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I admit that I was not a fan of this game at first, but my 4 yr old son stuck with it and managed to figure more out.  Now it's a game he adores and is rewarded with.  This one makes you think and use some basic physics.  Cute.  Also a little tricky but when you are 4 you don't really care about getting ALL of the stars anyway.
B008EKMGPA|3.0|This Glyndebourne production of Handel's great \\"Rinaldo\\" is set on a Harry Potter type school for teenagers.  There are misbehaving children, amorous teachers, and dreams of battles, crusades and sorcery.  BUT, does it work? Alas, not for me.<br /><br />\\"RegiaTheater\\" is the term used over the past decade or so, for stage works (plays/operas) wherein the director's radical take largely overwhelms the underlying work being performed.  It has, here in America, a very negative connotation, smacking of German/Austrian uber-works and director hubris.  Most opera fans here will say that they hate it and just condemn these productions, often sight unseen.  (\\"I'll play the dvd but only to listen to the music.\\") But, the audience for these directorial efforts is more amenable in Europe.<br /><br />But what is RegiaTheater really?  The idea, as here, of changing the time and place where the work is set is hardly new.  Orson Welles did it in the 1930's with Shakespeare, and the idea is so common as to be hardly radical.  I can scarcely think of a Shakespeare play that I have seen in the past fifteen years (live or dvd) where this wasn't the case.<br /><br />The same is true with many opera productions, both now and over the past years.  Think of Peter Sellars updating of the Mozart/DaPonte operas into modern New York [[ASIN:B00092ZANQ Mozart - Cosi fan Tutte / Susan Larson, James Maddalena, Sanford Sylvan, Peter Sellars, Craig Smith, Wiener Symphoniker, Peter Sellars]]; [[ASIN:B00092ZAN6 Mozart - Don Giovanni]]; [[ASIN:B00092ZANG Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro / Sanford Sylvan, Susan Larson, Jeanne Ommerle, Sue Ellen Kuzma, Frank Kelley, Peter Sellars, Craig Smith, Wiener Symphoniker]].  Or Jonathan Miller's mafia-style Rigoletto of years past [[ASIN:B000LP6KU8 Verdi - Jonathan Miller's Rigoletto]].  This updating/transformation is as common in opera now as it is in Shakespeare play performances.  But is it the evil \\"RegiaTheater?\\"<br /><br />I address this here because I have just watched two 2011 performances released on dvd where this was a key part of the production.  This performance of \\"Rinaldo\\" and Pesaro's production of \\"Mose in Egitto, set in modern war torn Middle East [[ASIN:B009F7YTC4 Mosè in Egitto (Rossini Opera Festival 2011) [Blu-ray]]].  (I thoroughly enjoyed the \\"Mose\\", but found this \\"Rinaldo\\" much less effective.)<br /><br />And even the Peter Sellars productions of the Mozart operas were artistically uneven, in my opinion.  (The Cosi set in Despina's Café worked quite well, and Figaro set in the Trump Tower worked pretty good, but a Count living on the 50th floor?  I don't think so.  And the \\"Don Giovanni\\" set in Harlem's ghetto did not work well at all.)<br /><br />But let's start by examining this Rinaldo.  It opens during the overture, with Rinaldo (played as a trouser role by Sonia Prima) entering the classroom, dreaming about adventures.  He is then beset by his classmates, and eventually the teacher where he is caned for some offenses.  Thereafter, it transforms into the Crusader world of rinaldo, and plays out the story.<br /><br />In most of the first act, the actors where their school gear (preppy jacket and ties, pullover dresses for the girls) with armor or helmets placed over them/.  In the second act, the school clothes largely disappear un til the end.  For me, this staging really didn't work, and just didn't make sense.  One detail, which illustrates it for me.  Ultimately, it is a love story between Rinaldo and Almirena, where they profess their profound love for each other several times.  But, both are dressed in prep school outfits, clearly intended to be about 14 years old or so, so this intense romance (even lust) is highly in appropriate.  So, again for me, it just didn't work.<br /><br />The singers were quite excellent.  I particularly enjoyed Luca Pisaroni as Arganto.  He followed it up later in the year with \\"The Enchanted Island\\" [[ASIN:B008ROGZUK The Enchanted Island (The Metropolitan OperaHD Live 2011)]]where he was also excellent.<br /><br />So, is it \\"Regiatheater\\" and what does that mean?  I take it this way.  Any radical changing of the setting/time of a work is a form of regiatheater, so just labeling as such  is not helpful.  All that really matters is does the change make for an effective production, one which MAY get you to re-think other aspects of the work in question.  (Also to be considered- is it internally consistent, which can be a problem.  If it is not consistent, then it is effect just for effect's sake.)  And sometimes, whether it is regiatheater or not may just be a matter of degree (how much is the underlying work smothered by the staging?).<br /><br />Here, although I didn't think the staging overwhelmed the story, I just thought it didn't make sense.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey Series. It is so beautiful! The costumes, the castle, the people--each character is played so well that you almost feel you know them. I wish there were an endless amt. of episodes to watch! I really love it and I'm part of the fan club. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great story, great cast, beautiful costumes, and the beautiful castle! Fabulous!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an easy read with a complex plot. Just read it. Now.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good app to pass the time, at least for my kids.  Very nice graphics and rich colors which provide additional visual excitement.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book did not disappoint me. I loved the first book, The Hunger Games, and Catching Fire had me glued to every page. However, I did feel that they rushed the beginning of the book a little bit. I feel like they there was some hurry with getting to the games. Also, I really enjoyed the dire need for survival and panic aspect in The Hunger Games that I just didn't feel when reading Catching Fire. There was a big twist at the end and I recomend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first one as much as I did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best game ever I play it all the time over the weekend and during the day I love this game

B0055PGUYU|3.0|It is not as expected. Many times it is boring<br />It has some tips that are beneficial but most of the time it is not.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I'd a alright game it's kinda hard though I don't think a kid could play it but it does past time by

B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the series I'm still sobbing from the ending though. I'm even doing a report on the hunger games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously. I have been reading some of the one star comments, and some people say the story line is predictable. It is so original and greatly written
B007HACDLK|4.0|The ability that Mr. Flynn has to record supposed conversations in the<br />text makes you feel that you are actually hearing the words and feeling the emotion of the moment.
B002RFX9R2|5.0|There is a good reason Chronicles is still selling welll. Creedence's 45s were vital rock & roll. That said there is probably not much call for this. I bought it to feed my 45 rpm jukebox having sold my 45 collection a decade ago (but for the money records and a couple of hundred for the jukebox). It is priced reasonably and provides different picture sleeves than the original releases. But then, with vinyls resurgance and the belief of some that 45 rpm provides a better sound quality than 33 rpm, shell out the cash for this.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I just love it he always gives a good book. I love to read about Painter and his team, you never know what is going to happent next
0971855110|5.0|This book is great to motivate you to start re-thinking the way you view your household activities and the stress that sometimes comes with handling those day-to-day activities and family concerns.

B004LROUNG|4.0|I really liked this novel. Well written. Thoroughly enjoyed the humorous touch, too. A bit of humor makes life tolerable even when things go wrong!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. A Game of Thrones is a real page turner that you do not want to put down and just keeps gaining speed throughout the entire book. I very much look forward to purchasing the second installment to the series and highly recommend this read to anyone that enjoys tales of days past with knights, lords and kings. If you do read this book of deceit where you aren't sure of anything or anyone, you'll truly see why it is named a game of thrones...
1608870081|5.0|The book is great! High quality construction, great graphics, and an amazing layout. I would not recommend it for children under 5 however.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Loved it! So adding it to my collection. Great for adults and kids. We were all cracking up and the cast they picked up for the voices was great!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is really fun. It crashes on the kindle sometimes but I can deal with that. overall great gameplay.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So many twists and turns keep you fastinated.  There's never a dull moment!! Hope there are many more seasons to come.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|What a great game! Playing on k-fire.  No prob's at all.  Three worlds in arcade with 99 levels each.  Also has classic and mineral.  &quot;Cannot go wrong with this game...lots of fun playing time!&quot;  5 STARS*****
B005U9RE1Y|1.0|I have extremely fast Fios Internet connection yet the quality of this movie was awful I will never again rent from AMAZON.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|There are a few prominent people who are currently spiraling down because of bad choices earlier in their lives.  It is a very realistic story.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Seems very slow in the middle and I have to really push to finish.... I thought it very interesting but slow
B001HN6922|3.0|I suppose I could see why this film is Pixar's least critically successful feature, but for what is is it is pretty entertaining. I find it a little more entertaining than the original Cars, but the idea for Cars 2 to be a spy movie..well, let me put it this way; I think a spy themed film would be better off as a separate Pixar film. The idea for this movie is somewhat pointless, but its not a terrible movie (and to tell you all the truth I enjoy it more than Pixar's Up). But I think this represents that the Cars francise is more for little kids. I recently watched Doug Walker's Disneycember review on this film and we both agree that The Incredibles was the Pixar film other than Toy Story to deserve a sequel. Watch this and you'll understand his point.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|It is great to see a quality movie with action and a real story. This movie proves that you do not need to throw bad language, sex, and violence around to get quality. Thank you for a movie like this!  Mavericks is better quality and cleaner than what you can get on network tv on any given night. Producers can learn a lot from the group that put this together!
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|Out of all the Dreamworks' CG Animated films, this is probably the weakest (kinda interesting because the NEXT film \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" would be my favorite of all time). There's no comedy, no adventure, it's just bees talking to humans and humans being surprised by talking bees- *sigh*. I have only seen this once in my life and I barely remember that I even saw it. Jerry Seinfield is a bland boring uninteresting actor, the other characters are forgettable, Patrick Warburton is kind of funny, but he's an actor who have played in too many roles. The climax is boring and weak. Also the idea that bees can only choose one job and are stuck with it forever is just-terrible! For me, I can't find enough to like in this film. Personally, I'd skip this one.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|This is such an upgrade from the crumby MGM release, but seriously...where's the darn blu ray? This edition is crisp and clean and fits your widescreen TV. Awesome...can we get up to date and have a blu ray?  haha
B004J09ONG|5.0|Time has not diminished the high quality and endearing story told through this 1965 movie. This one you can watch with the kids.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I loved this movie! It has all the elements of a cheesy blockbuster, but somehow succeeds in avoiding all the tropes and cliches. It's a completely original concept even though it's futuristic-police-force-of-mercenaries has been done (poorly) before in The 6th Day, Minority Report, and Total Recall. I loved the new take on time travel and liked how the filmmakers handled the obvious logical problems associated with having yourself and a future version of yourself in the same present moment. It was a mental stretch, but I had no trouble suspending my disbelief.<br /><br />All in all a must-watch movie. Bruce Willis is totally great and actually doesn't overwhelm the rest of the cast, who all got a chance to act along side the superstar.
142314189X|5.0|I ordered this set for my eight year old daughter as she loves Percy Jackson.  She enjoys this series so much that I actually give her a book at a time as a reward for school accomplishments, etc!  It's hard to get her to put these books down!
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|Every one of these movies has been cooler than the previous one. The first movie was extraordinarily tame by comparison to the ones which followed, and this fourth installment doesn't disappoint! In my opinion, using the X-Box 360 Kinect as a night vision ghost-visualizer was an extraordinarily cool and inventive idea.<br /><br />In the second movie, the coolest moment was definitely when all of the pantry doors blew open at once. In the third movie, I loved the idea of attaching the camera to an oscillating fan (I mean, it was one of the coolest film ideas in movie history--you were always wondering what would happen once the camera oscillated back and forth), and in this movie, the ghosts get captured for the first time actually moving around by millions of tiny dots projected from a Microsoft Kinect console. Very modern, very cool. I think that's basically what makes all of this entire movie franchise essential cinema: how creative can you get using normal household junk to tape the ghosts. In the first movie, he sets up a camera. In the second, you've got household security monitors. In the third, they stick the camera on a fan, and in the fourth, again--the Kinect. These quirky film making techniques are what makes the movies so interesting and unbelievably watchable. Each movie puts ordinary suburban families in extraordinary circumstances, which is always the basis for a great story.<br /><br />Yes, the story in the fourth movie jumps the shark a bit. Yes, it's sort of forced. But is 'the story' really why you watched any of the other movies? If you're looking for dramatic plot development, don't ever, EVER watch movies which are essentially stripped-down stories about scary things that go bump in the dark. Just have fun and enjoy the ride!
B001O1O71C|5.0|I feel the book was great but it feel it was a lot different from the movie.Nice it was awsome
B000067FP8|5.0|There is nothing better than watching a sweet little creature go crazy!  We enjoyed this years ago and have watched it a couple of times since receiving it.  Another classic family movie.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Kindle fire edition<br />OK imagine this. Your playing this game,  it becomes highly addictive, next thing you know your playing it all the time. Everytime you get some free time, your playing ..you rack up thousands of coins. Your score is getting higher, so you decide to invite your FB friends to play.

NOTHING.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|Horton Hears a who wasn't exactly what I thought it would be from the start but I wound up enjoying it. It is a childrens movie but has some interest for an adult; especially if you like a happy ending with only moderate suspense.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book from page 1! I've been hooked!<br />Ready to see the movie and see how everything plays out.<br />I would definitely recommend this book.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved this story, never thought it would end up being a love story but love the way it works out...so far. Now I get to watch the movie!
B0015XWUCC|5.0|This was a good CD of David Bowie. I enjoyed every part of this quality album. It was shipped quickly! philboatbike
B001C1066E|3.0|The Gamachan I was sent, the nose is off by a few cm, it doesn't align with the eyes so it looks kind of weird, and one of the eyes is positioned a little weird so it looks like the eye would come off but it's perfectly in place. It's still a cute product but I was too embarrassed of the nose and eyes to really show it off to my friends. Still good coin purse however.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|While watching with the kids we noticed instead of the Sorcerers stone it is the philosophers stone, we researched it and discovered it was how it was originally created but they dumbed it down for us Americans. Everything else is as good as it could be.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This is the best game ever I play  every day BEST GAME ever awesome awesome BEST GAME ever play every day

B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Clarke is what I like to call an &#34;Evolutionist&#34;.  In many of his works, he shows humans in a transition to a higher life form.  Using the &#34;Overlords&#34; as a &#34;deus ex machina&#34; in this well crafted tale, Clarke leads the reader through the transition.  The ironic twist of fate about the Overlords destiny lends an interesting counterpoint to the continuing development of humanity.  Surprise plot twists and multiple story lines keep the reader engaged.  Where does it end?  Remember, it's a story of evolution.
1400031001|5.0|Something about this book just hit the bull's eye.  A tale of a lad growing up in the 1900's England (and elsewhere), it's a quick moving and moving story.  The main character experiences an extraordinary and exciting life.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Using five fictional families, Follett skillfully blends their lives into the context of a changing world.  His dramatization of the ending of the Imperial Age and the impact of WWI and the Russian Revolution on the world is both vivid AND factual.  He gives life and substance to a time and events that seem remote and pointless to most people.  After reading this book, my wife exclaimed that she wished she had been able to read the book when she was in high school.
B000IZ21BS|5.0|I bought the instant download of Child's Play. Obvisously it was cheaper than buying the dvd but more convienent also. It was available to watch through my son's Wii game system.

Cuz if I do I would end getting mad at all the changes...so when not comparing this and forgetting about explosive pens, I look forward to future movies as Craig as Agent 007 because Skyfall was a great movie...
B009EEFTMC|2.0|Fun game... But today it won't open for me to play .... Please fix soon ..... Other than today it had worked great
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great show as it evolves from season to season.  The character development and change in relationships.  Looking forward to Season 5 and 6.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you are a fan of the British aristocracy in the early 1900's then this is a great show for you.The series highlights the trials of a wealthy family and those that serve them. Very well done!
B00AGKH45I|1.0|Well, the new Rumours 4 CD/DVD/Album package is for the most part very disappointing.<br /><br />The CD of the original album with Silver Springs added doesn't work well because they put it at the end of the CD, so it is right after Gold Dust Woman. It would have been better to put Silver Springs in the place of Songbird, which was at the end of the original album side 1, and put Songbird at the end of the CD to close the album.<br /><br />The two outtake and demo CDs are fun to listen to, but not something you will play over and over. They will get played a few times and then never again. And a lot of them are already floating around on YouTube.<br /><br />The live CD of the Rumours tour is good, especially the live versions of Dreams and Don't Stop, since those songs that were on the 1980 album Fleetwood Mac Live, from the Tusk tour, were both actually recorded at sound checks, and not live in concert. Also The Chain, Gold Dust Woman, World Turning and Oh Daddy are good, since they were not on the 1980 live album. But overall the sound mixes don't have very much bottom end and they should have included a few more songs on this live CD. It clocks in at 55 minutes and surely they could have added a few more live songs to make it worth the price. Most noticeably missing are live Rumours tour versions of Landslide, Over My Head, Say You Love Me and Second Hand News. And they did perform Silver Springs a few times on the Rumours tour, again one great version is on YouTube. That would have really been a terrific inclusion on this CD.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing thing here is the DVD of the Rosebud film. Most of it has also been on YouTube for years, and since Fleetwood Mac never put out a DVD of their videos ever, this would have been the chance to do so. The DVD is only about 30 minutes, and you don`t even get to hear most of World Turning. The end piece of that song which opens this film was shot in Santa Barbara in 1976 and also filmed then was a fantastic version of Over My Head. That and the full World Turning should have been on this DVD. And they should have added the wonderful taped studio version of Dreams, and the live performances of Over My Head and World Turning from the Midnight Special TV show. They also should have included the videos of Tusk, Sara, Hold Me, Gypsy, Big Love, Seven Wonders, Little Lies, As Long As You Follow, Save Me, Skies The Limit, Silver Springs and Landslide. It would have made this DVD really special, and again, worth the money.<br /><br />As for the new album itself, I, like most people don't even own a record player anymore, so this is a total waste. I know albums are making sort of a comeback, but that is only to a very small audience, so this should have been sold separately to those who want it. Most people will never play it.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac doesn't seem to completely understand what their fan base wants and sometimes they inadvertently insult us by appearing to not care and make us pay for what we don't want and not give us what we do.<br /><br />The money spent on this package would have been better used to buy a ticket to see them more than once on their upcoming tour.
B00B2QA646|1.0|When I read the novel, I took my time...devouring it one bite at a time, chewing slowly to savor it.  This terrible movie is like taking the finest cut of beef....and grinding it into two all beef patties.  It's impossible to care about the characters, the pace is frenetic and more time is spent on the oh so artistic (note heavy sarcasm) shift of scenes and the high school English level of symbolism that it destroys what should be an emotionally satisfying story.  It's almost as if the screenplay was written using Cliff notes and turned into a parody of what it should be.  Shame...I had been so looking forward to a sumptuous banquet given the talent involved in this movie.
B006RXQC2Y|5.0|Even with the passing of time, this is a great movie.  My wife and I enjoy watching many movies together but this is one that has no bad words and very few raunchy scenes.  A great general family movie in my opinion.<br /><br />I had a slight issue trying to purchase a 48 hour rental from Amazon.com using my account.  I first attempted to buy from my computer (HD) to watch on my PS3 in the front room.  This purchase appeared to go through but my PS3 never had an entry in the library for it.  I then tried to order from the PS3 and was eventually able to do it.  Good streaming performance.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This story is somewhat predictable, but still a great love story.  Nicholas Sparks book are a favorite of mine, so I enjoy reading them!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This book is beautifully written, painfully deliberate and so worth finishing.  One member of our book group did not finish the book because she found it too painful, but the others found it remarkably interesting in its presentation of resilience vs. fragility.  We discussed this book for nearly 90 minutes before we came up for air, a commentary on the feelings it raised in all of us.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time!  Very intriguing and it certainly keeps your attention!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The casting location attire and story lines converge to present a highly entertaining product. Easy to become involved in the lives of the characters.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Like all of Flynn's books, this is a page turner with a wild ending. I really enjoyed her character development and pace of the story; never wordy, but never incomplete
0740748475|5.0|We bought this for our grown up son.  He loved Calvin and Hobbs as a child.  He had all of his books.  Now is is all grown up and married.  He had this on his Chirstmas list! :)  He was thrilled and we were very pleased with the quality.  Lots of great memories for him.  We got our monies worth!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Last time I did things the hard way, converting my book to Word 2003, then to html, using Mobipocket to create the Kindle book, etc. Very involved over multiple revision until the book was finally ready to publish. This excellent, step-by-step book helped me move directly from Word 2010 to a working Kindle book with no false steps. Huge improvement over figuring out the process on your own and better than the online support info in kdp. Another big advantage was being able to read the &#34;to-dos&#34; on a separate device, my Kindle, instead of having to constantly switch screens on my computer from the online support to my book project and back. Thanks for this resource.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|We bought these to use in our small classrooms for what should be easy to deploy WiFi signal access. Whether running via PoE or with the included power adapter, directly to our switch, these devices are an absolute waste of money. They require an almost daily power cycle to get them to respond, they drop connections, and they are a pain to deal with.<br /><br />These are supposed to be setup, activated, and then left alone as they should just WORK. The setup is annoying, they lose their configurations, and they do NOT JUST WORK.<br /><br />Avoid these at all costs. A serious surprise that Cisco would make something like this. We upgrade the firmware and tried every recommended procedure to overcome these problems but nothing worked.<br /><br />The reality is they SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS. Get this fixed CISCO!

B002WY65VU|5.0|One of the best &#34;in role actor&#34; narrated films ever.  Woody Harrelson's classic bad-ass survivor is someone you would want with you in the crazy post-apocalypse world.  The two young ladies are beautiful, conniving and adorable.  Bill Murrary, although a minor character, portrays an excellent role.  Grab the popcorn and sodas and sitdown for a bloody good scream and film.
1451695195|1.0|It was awful.<br />Dr. Alexander took what could have been a 10 page story and turned it into a book.  I get the feeling that he wanted to make money off this story.<br /><br />I walked away from this book wondering why I wasted my time.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|A wonderful movie of the struggle to face the world on a daily basis as a TG person plus suddenly be tossed into the fire of having an unknown child.  The performances of Ms. Huffman is brilliant as is that of the troubled teen.  A story of trying to be who who really are inside and not how people see you.  The encounter with Bree's family is poignant and very hard hitting with the mother being someone you love to hate at first and then suddenly you realize she has her own demons.  An absolute watch for anyone interested in the world a TG person faces and the disfunctional families we somehow try to hold together even when you wonder why.  Highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We watched all three of the series, we are looking forward to the 4th series. Too bad you had to kill one of the main actors.

I hope none of these calendars sell for what they're asking and may these pirates who profit get cat scratch fever.

0062238868|4.0|This is a very well written book and the insight into the war in Iraq so sad to see a man that gave so much for our country and serves 4 tours comes home and is shot down in his own country that he was trying to defend from these types of acts of cowardness
B004W2V254|4.0|This film raised interesting moral issues about competition, ambition and indirectly, about the Nazis' idea of heroism as they were coming to power. Although the film is based on a true historical event I was not familiar with how it ended so for me the movie was full of suspense and tension. It's very well acted, and I'm amazed at how they got so many realistic shots of people dangling precariously from great heights. Definitely recommended.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|At 1st didn't think it was great but after watching it 3 more time, it is one of the best Bond movies ever!

B001QJUX24|4.0|I watched the Searchers a while back, and since I didn't remember much of it I assumed it didn't leave much of an impact on me. I've since merely brushed it aside as another one of those westerns about a cowboy who seems to have walked right out of a dry cleaners manages to shoot down hundreds of hooting Indians who charge at him recklessly, while never needing to reload. Until finally curiosity finally pushed me to watch it again. So I ordered it and watched it a few times.<br /><br />Not being much of a John Wayne fanatic, he certainly had a very strong screen presence. He played as Ethan, and ex-Confederate soldier who returns back to his brother's family as the American Civil War winds down. After his brother's family is massacred in a Comanche raid he goes off to find his niece whom is believed to have survived the attack. His character headstrong, never actually surrendering to the Union, and a bigot as well, given his attitude towards Indians including his mixed blood ride-along. His nature nearly gets the best of him as well in a climatic and very tense part of the movie.<br /><br />While the movie does feel generic, I guess that is only because of the massive influence it has had on other movies that either took inspiration or ripped it off all together. Overall a great movie, and definitely an important one not just to Westerns but in cinema history as well.<br /><br />On a side note, while many may find the portrayal of Indians in the Searchers unsavory. I find them amusing. Being a Navajo I've long heard about how Navajos were used extensively as extras in numerous Western movies including this one. Ironic given that culturally, Navajos don't have much in common with Comanches other than our ancestors were equally fond of horses as the Comanche were.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|Not bad. Good story premise, though some of the writing is not very sophisticated. Many typos, incorrect word usage, and missing punctuation throughout.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This version is so much better than Elementary.  The writers have brought this version into modern times in a very clever way.
B00004RF9I|5.0|This was a great movie. Very intense and filled with drama right from the beginning. I had seen excerpts of it in other movies prompting me to check it out. Wow it should have won more awards. Being from 1976 it is still pertinent today. Big business TV is probably worse today. I made other people in my family watch it just for the feedback and conversation.
B00821OX98|5.0|The series starts out pretty rough with bad acting and low production quality, but it improves greatly. It seems to get better with every episode and by the end it is one of my favorite series. Tough it out through the first 2-3 bad episodes and you will like it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book tells a wonderful story with a heart warming conclusion.  I grew up near Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter South Carolina during WW11 and watched these plain fly in and out all the time.  It brought back memories.  I really had a hard time putting it down.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The sets are extremely well done, the graft and corruption is well portrayed and the actors are intense in their rolls.  There is something in this Series to uplift and offend everyone.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Let's start off by clearing the air a little bit: if you are looking for the next best picture nod and/or the next great fantasy epic, this is not it (and, quite frankly, I'm curious as to why you thought this one WOULD be it). If, however, you can enjoy movies without deep character development or scenes of life-changing consequence, then this is a movie that I highly recommend. I can unequivocally state that this movie did not make me re-evaluate my life, nor did I shed a single tear over, well, anything in this movie due to its emotional narrative...but it was so much fun! I'm someone who can watch best picture movies that stretch your brain and emotions and enjoy them intensely - I am also someone who can fall in love with a movie simply designed to entertain, and, well, I fell in love with this one. I felt that each character was played correctly and hit the tones they were supposed to. There was plenty of action and - contrary to popular opinion - there WAS a plot. I went to the movies expecting to see a flick that would entertain me and I got exactly what I paid for - in fact, it was one of the most satisfying movies I'd ever watched simply for what I was expecting and what I got out of it. Also, for an R-rated movie, there was a lot less stuff than I was expecting. I mean, there IS stuff in it - it is R-rated, for heaven's sake - but it was a lot better than I'd thought, which was great. I can only think of one or two things story-wise that irked me to the point where I wanted someone to have corrected them, but I'll leave them for you to figure out :) I gave it 5 stars not because it was a perfectly made movie, but because I wanted to see it again after watching it...and I don't always feel that way about movies that ARE flawlessly made. Rent the movie if you don't trust me enough to see it in theaters, but I think you'll find it an enjoyable 1 1/2 hours.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was floored by the absolutely unbelievable number of incredibly creative people out there!!!  I get great ideas every time I check it out.  Tried some great recipes, and just tweaked a few of my own because I got inspired after viewing.

I hope she starts it off with their children and go from there. Just an idea.....
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of the best reads I have had in a while.  Each chapter is like a magic incantation and one of the best endings in novel-dom!  Highly recommend !
B000003EPN|3.0|This is a fine recording of Rigoletto, and the cast is star-studded. My reservations pertain to personal taste rather than objective flaws:<br /><br />1. Alfredo Krauss' voice is too \\"contratenorial\\"/feminine for my taste; I would prefer The Duke to sound more like Pavarotti and/or Alagna.<br /><br />2. Anna Moffo's voice seemed too dark and heavy for the role - she reminds me of Angela Gheorghiu's. I feel that this role would be better done with the lighter girlish voice of Cotrubas or Scotto.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book!  Stayed up all night reading it!  Wow! What an amazing first kiss! I can't wait for Holder's POV
B002PJ8BE6|5.0|Madama Butterfly, together with Tosca and la Boheme, is one of Puccini's most frequently performed masterpieces. It is brave to dare to record this opera, when you know that you have illustrious predecessors such as Tebaldi and Callas.<br /><br />Callas' dramatic sense and Tebaldi's pretty voice notwithstanding, Angela Gheorghiu outshines them both through a complete, mesmerizing fusion with the character Cio Cio San. She gives it her all, vocally and dramatically. Gheorghiu's voice is ideal for this character and she brings to her rendition incredibly beautiful coloring and phrasing. Her exquisite rubato shows her to be the most congenial soprano to Puccini's often-misunderstood style. Unsurprisingly, she won the Classic Brit Award 2010 for this particular performance. There are many videos on youtube where you can see her performing \\"Un bel di vedremo\\" - but that's merely an appetizer for this cd. It is a recording for the ages.
B003M70O5O|5.0|It's one of those rare shows that keeps you so involved that episodes seem to last about 10 minutes.  Like a good book, you keep saying &#34;one more episode and then go to bed&#34; until you look up and it's 2 AM.

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|All and all, this is a perfect app to act as a travel alarm. I'm especially pleased that it works when the KF sleeps, contrary to a couple of reviews which almost dissuaded me from getting it. I even like the unobtrusive weather data in the upper left corner. However, because the ads ARE obtrusive and cover the three icons at the bottom, I couldn't give this more than 4 stars.<br /><br />Perhaps in other Android devices, this will stay on all night, but with the Kindle whether plugged in or running on batteries, when the Kindle sleeps the display goes off. Again, the alarm works with the Kindle sleeping, when using other apps, or just reading a book.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|The game is ok but sometimes more child-like than for adults. Overall it passes the time.  It could be more challenging at times to be more enjoyable.
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|Rarely, very rarely does one like every song on an album. Push the Sky Away is one of those rarities. Not only is Nick Cave's voice at its very best, but the music by the Bad Seeds blends perfectly. I tried to select two or three songs to list as must listen to songs ... that didn't work, I'd just end up listing them all.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|So, I love Kung Fu movies and this is definitely very much a throwback to some of the old school 70's ones...but there is one giant glaring issue with this movie.  The RZA decided to not only direct, which was hit and miss, I could see him improving, but he decided to star in the film.  Why exactly I would want to watch The RZA, who does not even sort of appear to know any form/s of martial arts have a decent amount of screen time fighting is beyond me.  Let's also just put out there that he may have written himself one of the most laugh out loudable all time back stories I have seen.  The music was very good during 90% of the movie so I won't comment on that really, I overall rather liked it.  Wish I could get my money back on this purchase though.  If I could give The RZA an idea of what would have fixed this movie it would be...don't cast yourself as the star and just stick to the action which was definitely this movies strong point.  I have mostly no complaints about that aspect.  Just was hoping for an average film from a technical standpoint with Kung Fu in it and did not get that.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|awesome game , out of the norm . the levels do take some thinking, and sometimes I scratched my head a bit too much , but still , there's nothing better than walking around as an ugly stickman and love it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is amazing because Dr.d and his new minonator are on and instead of water he needs sludge. I would definitely recommend this app!
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a good reminder of world events that occurred when I was only 9-10 years old. There was less propaganda involved that I had expected and....while others have criticized the movie for some of its historical inaccuracies....I did not find these items to be significant.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good loved it from page one of book one to the last page of this book again lost without another good series
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed it lots. Not as addictive as 50 shades but still enjoyable. About to start book 2  of the series. Well written and I'd like to read some more Sylvia day books.
0307346617|4.0|Brookes was not trying to write the War and Peace of zombie novels. He was not trying to carefully explore the psychological development of a large cast of characters. The book would have had to be twice or three times as long if he wanted to do this. Instead, in a relatively small amount of space, he wanted to explore the worldwide ramifications of a solanum epidemic. He accomplishes this in World War Z. All of the stories are engaging and, even though a substantial amount of character development does not occur anywhere due to the author's chosen format, this only occasionally detracted from my personal enjoyment of the story. Don't become too attached to a particular plot or character and you'll be fine. Several times while reading I felt a little frustrated over the briefness of each account. A few of the narratives could have and should have been extended and, for this reason, I give it four instead of five stars. World War Z is good, but choppy. On the other hand, one wonders if more detailed narratives would have kept our attention.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am obsessed with this book.... As in I pulled an all nighter to finish it. and then read it again two days later. I'm weird, I know. But the book, honestly, was that good. I am so so excited that there's a book two coming out. However, I'm bothered by how long it's taken for boo 2 to come out. Either way, the author made us readers fall in love with the main characters... especially Travis ::sigh::

B00003CXMG|5.0|I came of age in the early Seventies.  Long hair.  Bell bottoms.  Sex.  Drugs.  And rock 'n roll.  And Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical ALMOST FAMOUS captures this extraordinary time, when rock bands and their groupies explored communal love and carnal desires in tour buses and flea-bitten motels.  This film is a coming of age tale for 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a talented teen who gets a once-in-a-lifetime gig from 'Rolling Stone' magazine to cover the up-and-coming band Stillwater as the group embarks on a national tour.  Stillwater is led by lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup is sensational), a mega-diva who feels his considerable talents are wasted with his bandmates, and who keeps putting off interviews with the hero-worshipping William.  Yet the band is smart enough to allow William into their midst to befriend him--a strategy the members hope will result in a glowing article; and this midst includes the traveling groupies, including Russell's favorite, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).  William becomes smitten with this flower child, and accordingly, comes to resent Russell's callous treatment of her.<br /><br />The interactions of the band, their fans, and William's eye-popping observations of all that transpire, are as believable as they are hysterical.  And during this journey, William is mentored by a cynical publisher (Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a terrific performance) and his progressive, yet overbearing mother (Frances McDormand ain't bad, either).  Over the course of three breathless weeks, William experiences love, euphoria, disappointment, and angst; for this teen, it's a life-altering experience.  Yet for Stillwater--in particular, Russell Hammond--their lives are forever altered, too.  And this tour causes Penny to do some serious soul searching of her own.  The music is terrific, the interactions totally credible, and the comedy flaunts a distinct, hard edge.  If you never got to experience the Seventies, ALMOST FAMOUS is one of the best ways to see for yourself how we old geezers used to get our grooves on.<br />--D.

B000000OE7|5.0|I am self-confessed Freddie Mercury lover and everything about him touches me in a deep way.  So when I bought this CD, I was definitely prepared for some heartache, knowing what was going on in his life when this was mixed (many of of the tunes were recorded years before)and also recorded-and what the band was going through with him.  What I didn't expect (why I don't know, because Queen has never disappointed me)  was how wonderful the music was on this CD.  I knew it would be good, but the different tunes, the maturity of it, the soulfulness makes me rate this as one of the best they ever did.<br /><br />If you love Freddie as much as I do, be prepared for these tunes to rip your heart out.  But I must be a masocist because I don't want to turn it off.<br /><br />I definitely recommend adding it to your Queen or Freddie library.<br /><br />Just an addendum to my previous review.  You really FEEL Brian in this album.  His touch on Freddie's vocals, his superb (as always) guitar playing, joining with Freddie's voice is just poetry.  It took Brian 2 years to to finish the mixing on this album and he was going through much too, not just the loss of Freddie, but his father and the band itself now without its charismatic front man-and the loss of a lifelong friend.  Listen close to the tracks and you can almost see him sitting at the mixing board, with that wry grin on his face and nodding as he puts it together.

1936608898|5.0|My boyfriend and I got this book as a challenge for the new year. We are avid crossfitters and have been curious about the Paleo diet but not entirely sold on all of its concepts. What drew us to this book in particular is that instead of claiming to be another \\"Paleo\\" book... it claimed healthy, sustainable, life changing dietary concepts. This book is about eating the best foods for your body and understanding WHY certain foods should be avoided, or limited. I also like that the emphasis is on my individual experience, and that it shows me how to cater the information to me and my body, and the way I personally react to certain foods. It talks a lot about auto immune diseases and how foods can affect inflamation and hormonal changes in your body. Since being on the 30 day challenge (which has morphed into an ongoing lifestyle way of eating for us) I sleep much better, my chin acne has completely cleared, I have more energy throughout the day, I am working more efficiently in my crossfit workouts and seeing clear and big gains. I have dropped about 4% body fat and lost about 5 pounds.<br />Since reading this book and implementing its ways, my guy and I have purchased 4 additional books and gifted them to friends and family. They too have all had positive changes. READ THIS BOOK, it will change the way you think about food and what you put into your body.

B00AYB1RGG|4.0|A pretty good movie with enough special effects to keep your attention.  Rather stark and dreary set of a high-rise apartment building in the not to distant future.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very good characterization and plot; gives an extremely clear picture of its characters lives and thought processes.  Interesting and enjoyable.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My wife and I really loved this movie.  Parts of it were utterly hilarious but it also had a more mature side to it.  Terrific animation made it a pleasure to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I live this game it is fun and life like! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves playing virtual horse games.
B008B403VS|5.0|...has an excellent quality to it. made very well and durable. matches other transformer masterpieces in weight and size. about the height of mp ten optimus...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is similar to super mario world. The graphics are clear and colorful and a delight to view. The sound quality is also good. There are levels to the game that I am going through now, so I can't tell you how long because I am stil playing this. Overall it is a very nice game and the litle Lep is easy to navigate through out the game unless you fall lol. Great app!
159413586X|4.0|I don't want to finish this book, cause I do not want the story to end. So, I am taking my time and reading it at a slow pace(which is hard). Not a big fan of the extra large print, but it works.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am going to invest in a Kindle card lol. I am very impress with this puzzle app. It provides a set of pictures which is a catagory. Under the catagory are a few lovely pictures you scroll with your finger from right to left or visa versa to choose a puzzle to assemble into a full picture. This app also provides different sizes. Theres a side bar you can slide also to choose the puzzle pieces for that picture and place it in the center or where you think it belongs. Its just really great and yes magical. The app, for being free is good it also gives you an option to purchase more, I have seen landscapes so this is a keeper for me. Great while in a doctor office or to kill time or for just enjoyment. You won't be dissapointed. My favorite are the Annie babies sleeping in flowers or in as flowers themselves in groups very beautiful and the kittens.
1594135851|5.0|I read it too fast to enjoy. I could not put this book down! Not a big fan of the large print, but it did the job!
B00633W614|5.0|cant wait for the others to come out in a few months, big fan of this author. yadda, yadda, yadda
B000065V42|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid, now my kids love it too! It came sooner that it was suppose to. We watched it so many times it is scratched already, after only a month!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Can't always activate the menu button while playing a game when you want to start over. Fun game to play when waiting for an appointment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the best game in the world gotta get it or you are a nobody and I mean a nobody so get it right now
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Personal fav is the thunderstorm. Since my whole purpose is to be<br /> lulled to sleep by a comforting monotonous sound, loops just add to the monotony and have never been a problem or concern.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought that the twists were unpredictable and made me want to turn the pages every time! Best book I have read this year! If you like romance this is the book for you
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful easy read with important insights for everyone.  Should be required reading for all schools.  Something for everyone to learn from.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It did mess up and I lost my characters and my money but I kept my rank.
B002RV01QI|5.0|My daughter's preschool used to play this CD at nap time, so I bought it for home - she loves it.
B008IBPMZG|4.0|This is a very nice show.  Depicts a historical period and shows life in this time period with out pointless violence language sex or nudity.<br /><br />Enjoy it very much and look forward to each new episode
B001LX2J22|5.0|There is great acting in this movie. If you like suspense and police/detective type movies or tv show then you would also enjoy this one!
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Great movie for anyone! Just puts you in a good mood and makes you want to dance after!<br />Definitely recommend it!
B0073PPNE8|5.0|This is a movie about the hardships of the civil war and love. I would recommend it to people who enjoy movies about war and love.
B00340LM8C|2.0|I don't mind rating things but don't want to write a review<br />Far too old a movie. It was O.K in its time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love love love it<br />this game is great besides the snake and fruit game I cant pass it I got 4900 and needed 5000 but cant ever get that
B0000541AM|5.0|Ordered on the 16th, received it on the 19th -- WOW!  Since I KNOW it's not the &#34;enhanced director's cut&#34;, or whatever the f*** they called it (which had a montage of cartoon scenes in nearly every break), I am looking forward to seeing it SOON -- when ya gotta slot in movie time, you KNOW you're committed!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my horse is a great game. my daughter really enjoys it. we have a lot of fun playing together. great for independent readers
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I can't wait for the next one to come out - i'm still on the edge of my seat, what a great read!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|It is interesting at times but then wanders off and is a bit hard to keep track of, I am afraid i gave up.  I had been reading it for days and my Kindle said i had only read 5%!!!!
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book for my twin grandchildren who are 3 1/2 years old.  I told them that it was a MAGIC book before we started.<br />As we went through the book, their giggles and reactions were priceless!  They really thought it was magic and were mesmerized by it.<br />They then took the book home and I assume they are still enjoying it.  Nevertheless, the first time reading it with them was definitely entertaining.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Sure am glad my neighbor loaned me his copy so I didn't have to pay for this mess.<br /><br />It seemed to be disjointed throughout, as if the director had more of a vision to see how many disaster scenes he could cram into this rather than taking any time to develop any of the characters. The characters never seem to connect and the acting was rather stilted and juvenile.<br /><br />I also found it to be very unrealistic. The main hero seemed to spend about 1/2 the movie driving some type of vehicle a hair breadth away from being swallowed up by the crumbling terrain behind him. It was also a stretch when he left his 7 year old daughter behind in a camper, seconds away from disaster, so he could climb a hill to speak to a radio jock - I do not believe any loving father would ever leave his child behind in such a situation, I'm a Dad and wouldn't even consider laeving my daughter in a dangerous situation. And his co-hero buddy, the doctor, who had a few hours flying lessons, is suddenly a capable twin engine pilot before going on to be the co-pilot in a Soviet Anotov cargo plane - one of the largest planes in the world. Then there are countless scenes taking place in foreigh countries with the actors speaking those languages but they don't bother with any subtitles so the viewer has no idea what is being said or how it pertains to the movie - they would have been better off having these scene with the actors speaking English, at least we would know what's happening. There is more but it is a pain to bring up additional scenes from a lackluster movie.<br /><br />Overall, this whole movie stretches the bounds of believability to the point where they snap about 1/2 way through. I know this was supposed to be a depiction of what the seers predicted of the great 21st Century Hoax of the Mayan prophecy but it didn't even do that well. It was just stretched too long, done too poorly and very disjointed.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Learned many things about Lincoln that are not well known. He was a great man
B000QXDED6|3.0|I just saw this movie its alright comparing it with Immortals, The immortals was better much more passion to the movie. Plus it showed more debt. The movie 300 and Immortals seem to be in same category if I had to guess. The Ugly Truth the whole movie is friendly  to watch plot of story was strong. Gerard Butler played in. I would recommend  The Ugly Truth.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|~<br />This is a great game!  But very addictive.  One night I played it so much I was seeing those design blocks in my eyelids when I went to sleep.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Before purchasing this, I did read reveiws that were posted and did comparison shopping.  This seemed like a very good choice and it been just that!  It is a perfect and simple cover without any flash.  The product is well made.  I would recommend this to anyone who has or is considering purchasing a Kindle Fire.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I Will keep my comment short- It WAS NOT a 007 James Bond movie like back in the good ole' days. Try again !!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Loved the Storyline, the special effects and Thor! When the world of &#34;gods&#34; goes awry, there's always a hero and a villain. This one is told really well. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend highly!
1616550414|5.0|I preordered it about 6 months before it came out, was totally worth it! it's a beautiful book and contains tons of content tracing the entire Zelda history.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Of all the Transformer Movies, this one was my favorite one. A lot of action and storyline with respect to Alien Invasion. Loved it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have purchased series 1,2 and 3 and can't wait for series 4 next year. The actors, plots, characters and scenery are incredible. Unlike American series, it is tasteful, has no foul language and even sex is not explicit. A masterpiece.
B007N6ZH5M|4.0|The book authored by Mr Ruchir Sharma is a classic work.Mr Sharma has based his study on very important experiences he has during his visits to different countries.He has stuck out his neck and has boldly made certain conclusions which are based on very solid arguments from him.The book is very lucid and while reading one comes to know lot of interesting concepts which are named and so to say innovated by the author.Overall very logical and informative work
B00821PCJS|4.0|I didn't get a chance to watch this show when it first aired, I'm so glad to have found it on Amazon it's fun and can watch 2 or 3 episodes at a time!
0689835604|4.0|This is a great lift the flap book. The only complaint is my daughter finds it fun to rip the flaps off. Definitely need to beware of this issue while reading to her. The only reason I gave this book a four is it doesn't teach my daughter much at all compared to her other book &#34;Toes, Ears and Nose&#34;! That book truly helped my daughter learn all of her body parts and is a fun, interactive way to keep practicing identifying them.
B007RTAR64|5.0|daughter liked it but she will put it with her other collected dolls she said it was a good look a like
B0001MIQHQ|3.0|I got the product very quickly...  Just didn't read the fine print...  Won't play on any of my dvd players.  Boo.
B004G6WZLQ|5.0|Bought 2 of these.  One to keep for ourselves and one to give to a brother-in-law.  Have seen it many times. A little off the wall French humor.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The tech talk was interesting. The attention to detail is captivating. I cant believe the old crew is still going.
B003Y5H556|4.0|It tried to stay true to the old fairytale involving the key elements of the story while giving it a new and &#34;unique&#34; drama/lovestory makeover. It was pretty cool but I was disappointed with the way certain things were written, the whole I cant be with you because bla bla bla is really old and overused and they dont REALLY have a reason and the main character &#34;the huntsman&#34; Has a REALLY messed up hairdoo.. hes the only person in the movie with hair-gel and hes got a literal shitton of it on and it looks GOOFY AS HELL... Other than that.. yea.. it was pretty good, watch it because wolves are cool.
0449011917|5.0|Admittedly  not as intense as &#34;A Storm of Swords&#34; kinda drug on with the goings on at Kings Landing. But the dialogue with Sam and Maester Aemon was beautiful.
B005LAII80|5.0|After watching a 5 minute preview of this it made me decide to purchase Dredd it was absolutely incredible start to finish, I cant wait for another Dredd!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very nice. you need to sum it up a little more. it is very nice . You needs two's  sums its ups
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I saw the preview to hannah back when It first came out and I was really excited to see it, after much time has passed I finally picked it up on this blu-ray version and I have to say it was stunning, absolutely amazing movie, excellent storyline, you don't even know fully what the movie is really about &#34;besides Hannah being trained&#34; until you get further into it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good calculator easy any quick. Perfect when your in a hurry or on the go  and if you mess up you know it shows you couple last problems
6305433909|4.0|One of my family's favorite movies, we can watch it over and over! Great humor and beautiful music in this movie.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|LOVED playing this game. It has been the only one so far that has captured my attention for long periods of time. Even better than cut the rope.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless was very well written. Kudos to Colleen for a fast paced, exciting, and full of suspense read.  You can never go wrong with love, action, and redemption.
B0058FW06Y|4.0|This movie is a bit strange and hard to follow but after a few times i really love it!  One of my top 10 of the past few years
1781164266|5.0|This is an impressive book.  Its hard cover with a dust jacket and weighs in at 192 pages and almost all of the art is color.  Many of the pieces are full blown paintings.  Most of the material in this book (about 45%) is concept art from Dead Space 3.  While around 35% being from Dead Space 2, 15% from the first game and the rest from the graphical novel and spin off games.<br />  There are sections on Isaac Clarke, other characters, weapons, suits, the USG Ishimura, vehicles, Unitologists, Necromorphs, the Blood Moon, The Sprawl, Culture , Tau Volantis and the Wrecked Flotilla and the graphic novel.<br />  All of these sections are filled with commentary which is great.  Having something to read in addition to the pictures always makes for a better, deeper and longer experience in an art book.<br />  I do have complaints.  They all stem from one general complaint: I wish there was more!  What's here is so amazing but there are some things missing.  The other characters section only contains art from Dead Space 3.  So no Nicole Brennan, Alex Stross, Hammond, Tiedemann or *spits* Kendra Daniels.  There are a few suits missing from the second and third games.  Some weapons are missing.  I am sure this is because there is already an artbook for the previous two games and they didn't want to reproduce too much content but both of those are quite hard to come by.  I hope they do another book with more art from the other games.<br />  The Necromorphs section is pretty thorough and cool beans.  Slashers, wasters, stalkers, leapers, lurkers, The Snowbeast, The Tormentor, tripods, The Pack, alien necromorphs, The Nexus, crawlers, twitchers, exploders, Hunters (from 1 and 3), The Ubermorph, brutes and pukers are all present.  Weirdly missing are Feeders from the new game.  No bosses Proper from the first game are present.  And no *sniff* Dividers.  A great section though.<br />  Something else of merit to note is how large the environment sections are.  Some paintings span two pages.  This is great as in a lot of video game art books the environment sections are small and the art is reduced to puny thumbnail size.  This book really lets these beautiful pieces shine.<br />  I love Dead Space.  I love this book.  I have already been through the new game three times in two weeks and I have been through this book twice as many times.  This book is essential for fans of the series.  Horror/sci fi enthusiasts would find joy in these pages also.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I like the game but the demo in got the demo I hate it when it says you ran out of time
B005HED11Y|5.0|Purists may dislike the additions of better special effects, but this is a gem. The old series never looked so good.
1451662432|5.0|First of all, let me warn you: this is a HUGE book. A lot of pages.<br /><br />But the guy really has a history to tell.<br /><br />I'm not gonna say I'm a fan or that I agree with him in politics or whatever. I simply loved the book because it... tells it all (well, I  guess almost all...)<br /><br />Arnold talks, without bragging, albout his fees for the movies, his strategies, his business in real state, women he dated (again, without bragging), his sportive accomplishments, use of steroids, unfaithfullness, movie deals, movie locations, political negotiations, meetings and speeches, loss of loved ones, his upbringing in Austria, including lying to old ladies to get money in the streets of Graz to watch films! He talks also about gamesmanship against Lou Ferrigno and Sergio Oliva and also about his last and totally controversial Mr. Olympia title. He criticizes himself a lot, both about his personal and political life<br /><br />It' is a fantastic reading, and, even if at the end he gives his tips for success, one can only think that this kind of history will not easily repeat itself.<br /><br />I just can't understand how the guy did all that living in a 24 hour day!
0307719219|5.0|A good and important book which should be compulsory for politicians and economists. I recommend it strongly despite its shortcomings. The basic thesis, that countries which develop extractive institutions fail, wheras those with inclusive instiutions succeed is attractive and convincing. However, it is poorly and self indulgently presented.<br /><br />The author's basic theory is presented rather weakly in a few pages at the beginning and then supported with countless and I mean countless examples, they go on and on for hundreds of pages, more or less repeating the same thing. Revealation by absorbtion may well work, but with a tighter exposition of the proposed theory, concise reference to the many examples, with detailed explanation of just a few, and a stronger conclusions section, the book could have great rather than merely good.<br /><br />Despite the authors eminence, the editor was very weak and should have insisted on a book not more than half this length.The Latin American examples were very strong. Africa and other third world examples could have been covered far more succinctly from the point of view of colonialism (or not) generally, rather than detailing every case. Their view of China is fascinating but conversely on Foreign Aid their conclusions are unconvincing.<br /><br />Notwithstanding its flaws, I still think this is an important book to be highly recommended. One just needs to mine it richer veins rather than merely read it.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This product protects my Kindle, can stand it up vertically or horizontally, supports it well, and the orange adds panache!  I can find my Kindle where ever I put it down.... It is well made, well padded, and well, just wonderful!  You won't regret this purchase.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My 3 year old granddaughter wasn't scared at all, she loved it.  As an adult watching a kids movie, I enjoyed the characters and animation.  I watched is several times with her and just had to buy it, I knew she'd want to see it more than once after the first time (she actually wanted to see it again right after it finished.  For an older child there are even life lessons in the story that are meaningful. Well done, entertaining story line and character development!
B004X75RK4|4.0|...But man, Sandra's character reminds me so much of my own boss that it was uncomfortable for the first 20 minutes or so. Good enough to kill an evening with your gal.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|a very disturbing, but revelent book. this type of tragedy is happening so often in our lives. just shows us how easily things get out of hand if things arent diagnosed in the beginning.it also made me appreciate my son so much
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book was a great fast read and came just as I was into working through my own clutter and evaluating my material possessions. It gave me food for thought in different areas of my life as well. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants more without buying more.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book pops into my head each and every day. This book is a MUST READ for everyone from all walks of life! Short and to the point! Very eye opening on how you view yourself and others. Invest in yourself and purchase it! You will not regret it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great story lines all through the 3 seasons _ i'm not a gore or blood fan but I love this show!!!
B005LAII80|5.0|great movie but i bought region A blue ray AWWWW my fault  it wont work on my region 2 blue ray player doo
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|its fun and enjoyable but some kinks definitely have to be worked out. For example after additional colors are purchased, others are deleted. The other thing is people should be able to go back and check drawings. Finally, after playing many times, same words start to return. After this fine tuning, i would rate this a 4
1451695195|5.0|When so many scientists (medical doctors) discount patients' stories of afterlife experiences, it is refreshing and inspirational to hear of a doctor's near death experience and how it has changed his life.  A great book for those that have doubts about an afterlife and very inspirational.  It changed my thoughts and beliefs about the nature of heaven.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE REAL TRUTH OF WHO THE BORGIAS WERE,AFTER WATCHING THE SERIOUS,I HAVE READ ANYTHING I CAN GET MY HANDS ON ABOUT THEM BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AL SPECULATION.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I love anything to do with world war two. I love that this movie puts together comedy,, suspense and action. I seldom buy movies but I had to have this one. I'd say more but it would spoil the movie.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I JUST SIMPLY LOVE THE SHOW,I NEVER MISS IT AND RECORD EVERY SHOW TO WATCH OVER AND OVER,I LOVE DARYLE!!!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I Love season 7, all of the disc work really great, arrived really quickly i would definitely recommend this retailer.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVE this series... Great show with spectacular characters and acting.  I hope they keep making more seasons... I can't wait to see what happens in season 3.
B00633W614|4.0|I have read both the first and second book in the Clifton chronicles.  I enjoy historical novels that span generations so this was right up my alley!!  I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of the third book to be released this spring!!
B004H4XI5O|4.0|The narrative that Foer constructs regarding his experience training and competing in the National Memory Championships is impeccably compelling. It makes for a strong story that is enjoyable to follow along, and most certainly enough to keep anyone reading. But be forewarned, this should not be considered for those looking for a how-to book on memory techniques. It provides an insightful account of a history of memory, and a brief introduction to memory techniques, but doesn't elaborate on any of them.<br /><br />That being said, it is enjoyable and certainly opened my mind (quite literally) to the world of mnemonics.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Brilliant I'm disappointed that I'm nearing the end of what George RR Martin has written in this series I don't think I can wait for the story to end.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Bought this book when I heard about the film and realized that the book would-be both funny and poignant.  I found this to be true. Fast interesting pace and very well written Good portrayal of situational depression and memory loss.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Well the second book didn't disappoint another well written epic but George R R Martin can wait to start the next I'm hooked
0553801473|2.0|Fantasy has always been defined by the quality of \\"epicness\\" which turns off most mainstream audiences, but inspires fanatical obsession with a dedicated minority.  The first 2-3 books of the GOT series were rightfully heralded as genuine crossovers because they managed to strike the right balance between the mainstream and the dedicated minority.  However, the last two efforts by Martin have seen the epic universe increasingly used as a crutch to mask what has become a pretty tedious and muddled plot line centered around, well, plotting and the now way overdone theme of moral grey areas.<br /><br />Of course, the various plots, sub plots, and sub sub plots of families vying for power and the moral ambiguity it creates is the stuff that made GOT what it is.  However, what made it most interesting was the underlying sense of tension that we weren't just watching plotting for the sake of plotting. Instead, we were getting to know characters and the very rich backdrop of the world they were living in for the purposes of making it that much better when it actually...went somewhere.<br /><br />Instead, A Dance With Dragons, much like a Feast For Crows before it, continues plodding along with the theme of a party of characters on one long, harrowing[epic] journey after another stumbling upon a new castle/ruin/city where a series of plots, conspiracies, and sex ensues.  Rinse and repeat.  Except, yes, for this go-round we are reunited with some beloved characters absent in FFF. Unfortunately, it's hard to care about them once you catch up, as they too fall into this same pattern.<br /><br />The interest in the last 2 books really is being able to open up a new part of the map, so to speak.  You will, of course, get to spend a lot of time in unexplored parts of the GOT universe in DWD. There are new/under-explored families, histories, etc. abound.  But, the appeal for this is limited for most.  That said, as a fan of the series and being a bit of a completionist, I read it,albeit struggling at times.<br /><br />On the plus side, there's some potential for interesting story-lines later, for me at least.  You get the sense that eventually, Arya's story could really go somewhere cool, if Martin doesn't get too caught up in the whole \\"tragic/dark twist\\" trope and say chops off her leg, thus not allowing her to be a heroine \\"V\\" that she so desperately needs to be.  And, oh yeah, the whites and winter are supposedly coming, but you sort of forget that by now.  Another plus is that the TV series will have to be more plot-focused, making me look forward to the series that much more.  This is one TV series where I'm actually looking forward to what they cut from some of the books.
B00760BPOC|5.0|Another great read can't wait for the next one have spent the last few months reading this series and can't wait for the next book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Keeps you in suspense, can't put it down once you start. Heartwarming. Can relate to characters in book<br />Great read
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Can't get over how hooked i am on this series by George R R Martin. Another epic instalment and now time to move on to the next
B00ARAO720|2.0|I wanted to watch this movie because Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it and that was a bad idea. I would recommend this movie to people who like bad acting (not by JGL of course) and a movie that is pure riding a bicycle. Yes that's what it was about but it was literally the entire movie. I don't know why JGL was in this because he is a great actor and a lot of movies he is in are great movies but this one was a bust.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Having watched the TV show I said to myself I better get the book as the book is always better than film or TV show. And this book didn't disappoint can't wait to read the next one.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I loved the originality and the creativity that went into this book. I just wanted to keep reading and reading. There is such depth to the characters. Definitely recommend.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect when I first picked up this book but I'm glad I did. A lot of reviews said that this was the hardest to get through and if that's the case then I can't wait for Deadhouse Gates. The amount of characters and plots makes this book what it is because frankly I'm bored of books being dumbed down for a specific audience. Erikson makes it clear that either your going to absolutely love his books or your going to hate it. However if you love books like A Game of Thrones or any of The Legend of Drizzt series I highly recommend Malazan Book of the Fallen.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|The American Graffiti, Fantastic movie and on Blu- ray. A must have for your home collection. I just love all the oldies played in the movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well written, good storyline.  Can't wait till the next book in the Crossfire series. Sylvia Day does not disappoint as usual.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I love all their music, a great cd. Been waiting for a long time for the group to produce new music.  THANKS!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|No one can go wrong with this book!  It's great for church service, prayer service and home.  I love it!
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Tha album has an old feel to it getting back to the early roots without the fluff.  Strong guitar drives the rhythms.
B0049P1N3K|4.0|I learned a lot from this read and plan to use this information to enhance my life.  I also plan to share it with others.
B009GED3HS|5.0|For regular HIMYM fans, this season does not disappoint.  For anyone else who enjoys comedy, I would definitely suggest watching this show.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This by far is the best TV Series.  Season Seven is as good as Seasons One - Six.  It is amazing how the viewer actually roots for a Serial Killer.  He's a likable kind of guy...but still he's a serial killer.  I would highly recommend the whole series.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I lovede the Harry Potter books and wondered if she could write a book for adults.  She can.  I really enjoyed. She has a great eye for detail on life in the UK
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game...totally addicted!!!! Only wish you could get more coins and jewels without purchasing them...guess I just need to get better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I love the game but it needs the nether portal, red stone stuff, and buckets. I know there will be more updates but I wan then now
B0012FHGCW|5.0|That's what you learn from this movie. Long but never boring, happy and sad moments, a reflection on the purpose of life and family.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|Kipling is always an enjpyable read, despite what Disney did to the Jungle Books.  Mowgli and the wolves of the Seeonee pack, Baloo the bear, Bagheera the black panther - and of course the villains like Sher Khan.  Good reading for adults as well as children.  Classic writing.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's a great tool to use in our business and personal use.  I would recommend this to people I know.
0345803485|1.0|What a bunch of trash...and I don't mean sleazy trash, I mean garbage.  Bad writing, ridiculous characters, and a stupid premise.  Save your time.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|The story, the acting and setting were superb. I completely understand the oscar nominations! I wanted to go on-line and read more about the actual events that this movie was based on.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this Nicholas Sparks book. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat as well as enjoying the creation of a good relationship.
0446554995|5.0|As usual Two Graves is a spellbinding book.  The book is an interest catcher from the start.  Can hardly wait for the next episode of Pendergast's adventures!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I carry this around in my car so I can get steady table-top customer testimonial videos anywhere and anytime. Just use a simple camera phone and this tripod to revolutionize the way I market my services (video testimonials trump sales pitches every time!)
0307943259|5.0|Everything John Grisham writes is wonderful he has such a unique style. This is a really intriguing story couldn't put it down.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Love going inside the mind of one of the powerhouse entrepreneurs of our generation. Enjoy his anecdotes and he's definitely lived a full life :-)
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was the first Nicholas Sparks book I read.  I thoroughly loved the book and the writer.  I am thirsty for more.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Introduced to Settlers at a friends house and quickly became addicted. Bought our own board so we could take it around with us and spread the joy :-)<br /><br />&#34;I have wood for your sheep&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This cool stuff wicked game is not a boring game it is a cool getting used to game that you will love playing it is not only addictive it is new in your head I mean you will never get bored playing it.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Got this as a Christmas gift and love it! Fun and engaging for anybody interested in baseball, statistics, or business - of which I'm all 3 :-)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had to read this book for my English class  and I'm so happy I got the chance to read it!
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Although its a bit dated now, This was the best movie of the Star Trek series followed closely by Star Trek four.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Interesting characters but the plot and subplots were a little too dark for my taste. I'll have to do some lighter reading before I commit to the next book in the trilogy.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!  This one is great!  She is always telling me how she can speak for the trees now.  Very cute!
B0041KVZ1I|4.0|Packaging is great..... the quality of the vinyl is superb...... but the audio although crisp and clean lacks something that a &#34;direct to disc&#34; type recording would have.  If there was any distortion in the master recording...... it will be there in this digital version.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie is a funny version of all the zombie shows out there right now.  Woody is hilarious!  This would be a great movie for anyone who likes zombie movies and really wants a good laugh!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|The seeker , first wizard (Zedd) , Kahlan and an entire hosts of characters are brought from the pages of the books brilliantly written by Terry Goodkind.<br /><br />In my opinion, you will enjoy these movies
B00001QEE7|5.0|This is a Disney Classic!  I watched this movie as a kid and wanted it for my kids.  It is an excellent movie!  A must have for any Disney collection!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The seeker , first wizard (Zedd) , Kahlan and an entire hosts of characters are brought from the pages of the books brilliantly written by Terry Goodkind.<br /><br />In my opinion, you will enjoy these movies
B008J34466|5.0|Pink is rough and delicious! She has a beautiful voice and killer music! Oh yeah, and the CD got here really fast.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Great sound truck. Exactly what I expected<br />I loved  every truck , It took me back to every part in the book. Great selection!
B009LXECF6|5.0|Awesome service. Awesome CD! Bruno Mars has made the best 2 CD's I have heard in a long time. No contest.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|There is a problem with the initial run of the second Season of Game of Thrones. The digital copies are missing the redemption certificate. This product had to be returned to Amazon.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked this book. I think it does a pretty good job of dealing with a difficult and challenging subject all the while telling a love story. It's not formulaic with a &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending. It held my interest and I cared about the characters. I'll look for subsequent books by this author to be sure.
B003QSMC18|3.0|This movie would have been great if the voodoo elements had not been so dark and scary. I am frustrated with this trend in Disney movies of making the scary parts too scary for their intended audience of young children. My kids are 6 and 8, and I had to have them close their eyes and plug their ears for 2 or 3 scenes that are downright occult-ish and demonic. We wanted to watch the movie because we are going to see Disney on Ice and the Princess and the Frog story is included in the show, so I thought it would help them to know what was happening during the show. And like I said, it's a good movie overall, but the occult stuff (blood magic, tarot, demonic shadows, etc.) really freaked me out as an adult - definitely not okay for children!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|this case is absolutely perfect it fits beautifully and protects the case the best thing is that it adds some gripI don't need to worry anymore that it's going to slip how does my hand like a wet fish
034580404X|4.0|Love this book!! I couldn't be happier that I purchased it! I flew through all three of them in no time!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|That's all FB does on my kindle fire hd.  Sick of seeing that little circle spin while I wait for the newsfeed &amp; my comments to come up!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Written by an immature author who shares her wet dreams with us.  She has manged, against all odds, to make sex boring.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I was sceptical when I began the novel because I am such a fan of Pride and Prejudice, but I truly felt like P.D. James did not miss a beat.
0385535147|5.0|Grisham continues to get better and better.  His books should give anyone pause who's thinking about going into the legal profession.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hanging on every word right up to the end. Book three please! A must read fore sure. Can't wait to start the next.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|The only channel they list that I would watch, Doesn't Work!  Not worth 1cent!<br />They list a lot of channels, but do work?
B003O86FMW|5.0|These were tough books to read, as far as the content goes.  They should be required reads for social studies classes.  They are very powerful books and almost impossible to put down!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|loved the characters and the journey that this book took me on.  Felt every emotion.  Read it in one week!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have not finished reading this yet but he is one of my favorite authors.  So far, I have really enjoyed it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play Coin Dozer daily...it's easy and fun. Anyone can play and enjoy a simple game. It's a great game that you can go back to. The fun doesn't end.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This program is accurate and easy to use! Much better than any other weather program I have used!  Keep up the great work.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I had never really thought about reading this book until my teenage daughter was looking for something to read, and I recommended she try it. She told me what a good book it was, so I had to read it myself.  The story moves along very briskly, is an easy read despite being written so long ago, and was a real page-turner. No wonder it's become a classic! I had always thought of it as a &#34;children's&#34; book, but it's got enough heft that adults will enjoy it, too.<br /><br />I was so impressed with Robert Louis Stevenson's writing that I next read &#34;Kidnapped.&#34; Another excellent book, and a real eye-opener about Scottish history that I was unfamiliar with. Do yourself a favor and read them both.
B00416D7A4|5.0|My recovery time is shorter! They feel and look great on! The sizing was perfect. I am 6' 148 and a 29 inch waist, and I got a small. Can't beat the 30% discount either!
B007THA4FI|4.0|As a Harry Potter fan, I really, really wanted to love this book. I ended up liking it a lot, but I have to say that there's a bit of &#34;forced march&#34; reading required through the first hundred pages or so before the meat of the story develops. Once you do get through the beginning sections, you'll find the characters very compelling, and the story to be intense. I liked it a lot, and cared for the characters. I recommend it to my friends who like to read and are willing to give a book a nice long try. I just wish it had been a little more tightly edited. Not intended for children under 18, I'd say, because of the intensity of some of the scenes.  But it's good! Read it!
0307386171|4.0|Sometimes we express more by not expressing at all, a problem of communication is here told and wonderfully by the great Ian McEwan
0767812166|5.0|I have always enjoyed scifi movies and especially love this one. I had had a VHS copy of it but needed a DVD copy to watch, now I finally have it.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|Love criminal minds this was a really good episode just wish I could get a break on the price for the rest of the series!!!!!
B0000714BP|5.0|I'm not particularly fond of the whole men dressing as women thing, but these three men are great in their roles. I've always liked Patrick Swayze and he is really good in this role.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|Kerr never fsils to entertain with thought .well planned and believable plots. All of the BG series are worth reading.. Highly recommended.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best TV show. The shootout scene was kind of over the top though. Can't wait for the next one.
B0052GACNM|4.0|I wanted to own the album after seeing a few snippets on TV.  It has proven to be a good musical friend when I need something light and upbeat.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|How could anyone not love this classic movie. After all these years it still makes mu laugh till I have stitches in my side.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love the two books in this series that are out already and can’t wait for the third to come out.  I read the Fifty Shades series and really liked that as well and wasn’t sure how this series could be good without being the same.  It was similar in many ways but different in just as many and was still very good!  I felt like this series has more of a story line than just sexual that Fifty Shades (although don’t fret, the sexual wasn’t left out of these books by any means)!
B0019IB0II|5.0|I loved the confirmation of a oneness with the universe. I loved her ability to explain thoughts and feelings so clearly. It was a great read that I will share with many others.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is a well rounded movie, good plot, acting, all of the actors had great chemistry together, directing and photography. Best of all, it's a lot of fun!
B004GVUPFE|1.0|I tried this once or twice and didn't like it; however, it is so forgettable, I can't even remember why I didn't like it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I now have a better understanding and perspective on what snipers do and how important their job is on the battlefield.  People seem to focus on how many &#34;kills&#34; and don't realize how many lives they save providing protection for our marines and soldiers in battle.  Chris Kyle was a true hero and should never be forgotten. God bless America and God bless our military.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I liked the story and the actors are great specially Daniel Craig, In my opinion the best 007 movie ever! very recommendable
B00846REIS|5.0|It takes a few pages to get started but I couldn't put it down when I did. Cannot wait to read the next book
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Forest Gump became a classic the minute it hit the theaters. Very well produced, casted and directed. The storyline is like no other. Heartfelt, tender and warm story that gets on everyones heart. It's a valuable gift for the movie goers. Loved it!!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|A very enjoyable series, which manages (in my opinion) to avoid falling into the usual &#34;fantasy&#34; groove (though I say this as someone who has read, reads, and enjoys a lot of fantasy novels).<br /><br />I would, however, recommend waiting until the third book is released, or you'll be in for a frustrating wait.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I must say that I really had expected better ending to the series but you get what they give you right. I must also say that out of the series the first is by far the best and they should have stopped after the first but with that said this is by far the worst in the series. I also have to say that the series is not just for young adults which I am one, but that I think anyone from young to old could really enjoy at least the first book if not the whole series as well.
B001Q5397O|2.0|One of those movies that is so bad, it's funny.  The acting is one big ham sandwich.  The storyline is simple.<br />The &#34;Killer Klowns&#34; are so ugly the makeup man should be in jail.  Yet, I kept watching.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I must say I love pretty much all the batmans but this triology by far takes the cake. I love in the Dark Knight how Heath Ledger plays the Joker. And I also love in the last how Tom Hardy played out Bane but probably there would have been a better choice for Bane. I just wish they could keep Christian Bale as the Batman.
0446547573|5.0|That heading says it all!! This book is one the best he has written, in my opinion....I loved it! I don't normally go for these romantic, mushy stories, but this one was different. Recommend it!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I love this series of books. However with that said I also must say I wish they had stopped at just one because the first was by far the best and the third is by far the weakest and most dull. I have to say this one was just mediocre in the series. It is a great series of books and I must say even though it is aimed at young adults and teens I think just about anyone could start reading the series and really love at least the first if not all of them.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The quality of the video was good. I watched it on my Roku. This is a really good show and my husband really likes the acting. I hope this becomes a multi-season show
B004G600A4|5.0|This is by far one of the top animated movies ever made, In my opinion it ranks up there with Brave, Wall-e, and the first Shrek movie.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|It was my holiday read and I could not put it down. Absolutely love Jojo Moyes. This is probably the best book of her that I've read so far. Love her sense of humor. But even better, the story line is just something totally different and touches your heart. A sad, but lovely story.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This much hyped book was a disappointment. It was a descent into madness involving characters that I did not care about.  Some parts crude. Yuck. To me, not clever but depressing with no redeeming qualities.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is wonderful. You will not be able to put it down. It causes you to become lost in this world the lovers share. This book shows you that all relationship books are not perfect.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't imagine the movie is as good.  The author's description of the zoo in Pondicherry was marvelous, and his portrayal of the seasick tiger was incredibly funny.
0380807343|5.0|Coraline is a great read! It's creative and engaging. However, if you are not into spooky books then I would not recommend Coraline.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love this movie! I cant wait to see the next two parts!  I love every lord of the rings movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My son loves this game! He loves all the angry birds, but this one with the little monkeys is his favorite so far. I am willing to pay the money for the star wars one myself! LOL Love you birds!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|What a great ending to the trilogy. It was one of the best books in the series. LARSSON wrote the story beautifully, while adding historical events along the way. I will miss the characters & wish there were more books.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Too repetitive .... difficult to finish, very simple writing with tiresome repetition of the same phrases and situation.  Not a fan.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Awesome movie about our superheroes! Great cast of characters and story. I am already excited to see what they come up with next! Oh and amazon is cheaper than iTunes if you want to save some cash. Not on everything, but the majority of stuff I look at these days.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|The best for the best for organizing your life's priorities. We go a long way without paying proper attention to ourselves, caring about ourselves. Peck regenarates the self care and the self forgiveness we so desperately need.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Nice narration<br />Loved the bit with the chimera .<br />On to the next book as soon as i can buy it.
1608871088|5.0|This books was a joy to read and see the artwork that was done for the picture.<br />If you have seen the movie and/or read the Guardians of Childhood books. you will Love this!!
0547564651|5.0|I received the book very fast. And in great status, brand new and no damage at all.<br /><br />Pleasure doing bizz...
B008ALAHA4|3.0|Works as described, and works well.<br />But $20 for this tiny little adapter is nuts, but thats what you pay for living int he Apple ecosystem.
B002FOQY04|4.0|I like it. I bought this album when it got released and forgot to rate it. It's a good album, way better than Man of the Moon II if you ask me.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is my second Alawar Video Game I purchased for my Kindle Fire - and love this one as much as the other Twisted Lands game.  Beautiful graphics, challenging logic puzzles and the tap-find screens are great fun! Excellent game for long flights - please keep developing more games - Alawar games have a unique sophistication as well as great functionality!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Only reason I didnt give this 5 stars is because of all the typos. But the story was great and I am an absolute fan of Mark Watney! Great science, action, adventure and humor in a tightly written story. Thank you. This is the very first book I have felt compelled to write a review for.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The characters are funny. The stories are exciting. I love this series. Be sure to watch Serenity the movie after this. Cowboys in space.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This story just keeps getting better.  Very provocative story.  The author has quiet the talent of leaving you wanting more!
B004LWZWBU|4.0|the DVD did not work. A little frustrating since it was a Christmas gift for my husband who is a bird lover. But, once we exchanged it with ease he watched it and really liked it. He had not heard of &#34;The Big Year&#34; as related to birding and how serious people take it, so it was an eye opener for him. It is comedy yet serious at points. Pattie
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had reservations about purchasing this book but once I did, I literally could not put it down.  Purchased book 2 immediately upon completion!
B0073XM77G|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time in the 80's and I thought the music and illustrations without words was so cool. My sister had never seen it so I bought it for her and her husband as a Christmas gift. It's a cool gift if the person(s) has never heard of it. Pattie
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed all 3 books.  Such an erotic love story.  What more can I say other than it left me wanting more Grey!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|as a Christmas gift and as a movie with so many different subplots and types of love. The sound track is good as well. I like this movie, but it is not for little children. Parents view it first and decide but I think overall it is a good movie. Pattie
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Good but not the best of best Bond movies, limited gadgets and a light plot, with not much suspense in this movie.
0800141660|5.0|among sisters. Great sister gift. The title makes complete &#34;sense&#34; once you see how things turn out for them. I also like the time frame and period clothing. Pattie
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|i like to play but frustrated at times.  proabably not doing something right.  need some more practice and im sure ill get better at this. however i don't play all the time because it does get frustrating.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|love story. Keira Knightley is very good in this especially since she was just coming onto the radar in 2005 in the US. Pattie
B008IBPMZG|5.0|same as season 1 ,one of the best shows i have ever seen.You really become attached to the people,can'twait for season 3
076115678X|4.0|I like how each chapter is divided into different hair types AND the fact that Lorraine includes kinky coily hair. Very thorough and nicely written. Thanks for the cool natural hair care recipes. Would love to try the Deva Curl products but are a little on the pricey side. Sure I'll splurge and try it sooner or later, probably the travel kit.
B000IYU9HW|3.0|MacGraw and Oneal look terrific together and that lovely score will turn on the tears every time. But this is a simple story that really relies  upon great chemistry between the leads to make it soar , and  that's not here. They seem wooden and uncomfortable with each other much of the time. Compare their scenes of intimacy with , say Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor, who also play doomed young lovers  in A Place In the Sun... Different movie, different era ( well only 19 years apart really)  but you  can see the difference in  emotional heft when  the chemistry between two actors  is there -when they seem really into each other and not just saying lines.<br /><br />I'd never seen Love Story  in its entirety before but I'm glad I did. I can see why it may have been a huge hit in it's time, but it hasn't aged particularly well and it could probably benefit from a remake... Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence maybe?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is now the only alarm clock I use.  Recent updates have fixed the previous small issues I had with it.  No complaints.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Good product, arrived on the date indicated. Recommended 100%. excellent product. . . . . . . . . .
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very fun.  Lots of innovative twists with the different monsters.  Good message for parents and kids.  I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to.
1616550414|4.0|A little too much emphasis on Skyward Sword for my liking, but overall a pretty good book for fans of the Legend of Zelda series.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I really expected to hate this movie.  Rented it with credits - thought I had nothing to lose.  It was actually really good.  Great music throughout.  Very funny moments.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first book review. This author's ability to write extremely well, and keep the reader captivated combine to make this series an amazing literary literary adventure.<br /><br />Bravo sir for your magnificent work. I will eagerly await your next work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a great game. It teaches the fundamentals of taking care of an animal. Plus its great for all ages.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|No crashing, works great. Fun and simple to play. Graphics are better than expected! Worth downloading for sure. Also loads fast, no complaints!
1400067936|1.0|What special type of Idiot do you have to be to offer the Kindle Version at 2xs the Price of the Dead-trees edition (is there an electron shortage now???)... Really... REally.... REALLY!  I am now going to look for the publisher offering this 'deal' and work diligently to avoid any of their products in the future... I am posting this to my FB acct also... idiots.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of the most powerful books I have ever read.<br />It moved me emotionally even though I have never faced<br />these challenges.  I think anyone who reads it will<br />be forever changed for the better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My youngest grandson ask permission to buy this game, I said \\"yes\\" and he and my middle grandson had a wonderful time with it..as a matter of fact they were THRILLED and when they return for another visit...it will be waiting on them! It's a \\"one time buy\\" with many hours of FUN!!!
0887307280|4.0|A must read for every small business owner.  You will have an epithany. Because of this book I have increased my income by 60%.  Please read this book if you want to survive in small business.  It should be part of Biz-management class.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|This film is easily the weakest of the 3. It is well acted and has good production values, but fails to entertain due to a bloated running time, weak villains, lack of batman, superfluous side characters and numerous plot holes.<br /><br />If you stopped at the end of the previous film, you wouldn't regret it. It's the film you need to complete a trilogy, but not the one you deserve as a fan. It's ultimately disappointing.
B0035FQ1UU|4.0|But the John Cusack was unbelievable and over-bearing.  Very impractical in real life they would have been dead ten times over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thinks it's awesomeness really nice job<br /><br />Good good good app awesome app really love love love love love love love it
B0037NVM2C|5.0|Go Arnold Go! We all loved the Terminator what can we say.  A real classic syfy movie. We watch again and again and again.....
B00AWTTUHI|4.0|Key animations, well done, action sequences most seemed to do justice to the book(s)<br /><br />Background, all the super hero's made an \\"agreement\\" to retire, most left or went home, Batman reluctantly \\"retires\\" and that doesn't sit at all well with him.  Though he manages to sit through a good 10 years of that (according to the book, movie and the little previewy bits that I've seen about).<br /><br />In this, the second (final - books 3 and 4 of a 4 book set) part of the translation of Dark Knight returns series, the Batman is torquing off everyone with his \\"antics\\".<br /><br />Ronald Reagan (or a lookalike) is still in office and has a superhero as his lapdog.  Eventually leading to an explosive confrontation.<br /><br />I'd say more on this, but I know that when I read the initial books, this whole lead up to the confrontation and the confrontation itself was (at the time) an amazing thing and brought quite a chuckle from me.  So, don't want to spoil it, other than to say, the fight alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />That said... Anything outside of the key action, background buildings, anonymous cars, crowds, are at best animation fluff and sometimes you'd think \\"Hmmmm, maybe a blank screen would have been better\\"....  Way to much crappy looking non-descript filler that brings the overall quality down a notch.<br /><br />Is it true to the book(s)?  Honestly I can't say, it's been so many years since I've read them.<br /><br />I will say there are a couple of scenes, hero recovering from a major energy expenditure that you'll look at and say \\"whut?\\"<br /><br />So, see this if you will, I enjoyed it, but DEFINITELY recommend reading the books first.<br /><br />A lot of Frank Miller's book is the hero talking out issues to themselves and backfilling information that is helpful in understanding what is going on...  The movie winds up stripping all that for the most part.<br /><br />You won't get lost, but you will get a skosh confused.<br /><br />Oh yeah, you also get a good hour or so of additional material;  Talks of hero's, villains, and some of the thinking behind the scenes that were filmed.  Nice information, though Grant Morrison... and I love the guy's stuff... well, he should be english subtitled because I for one couldn't tell what he was saying half the time.  (Sorry Grant)<br /><br />Enjoyyeah, you also get a good hour or so of additional material;  Talks of hero's, villains, and some of the thinking behind the scenes that were filmed.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the characters and that they were flawed. It was something I could see really happening. I would get any other series this author wrote.

B009JBZH54|5.0|As an avid fan of these films, it's great to own the trilogy in a Bluray boxed set, it doesn't get any better than that. Love watching these movies over and over again, definitely recommend any fan should own this collection!

B009FZFONO|5.0|My husband & I didn't listen to our friends when The Walking Dead 1st started, plus felt we had already missed more than 1/2 of Season 1 at that point. When I started seeing commercials showing Season 3 would be starting in beginning of February, came on here immediately & watched Season 1&2. Hooked after 1st 1/2 hour of Episode 1!!! After watching those & in meantime had recorded on DVR the newest episodes being shown on TV then, what we thought was beginning of Season 3..only to become extremely upset/disappointed when we started the 1st of what we had recorded on DVR & immediately realized the scenes of \\"what was last seen on\\" & didn't recognize anything..only to find there was a 1st part of Season 3 shown back in November. We didn't know how we would ever be able to catch up, but did some searching on internet & was EXTREMELY happy to find we could watch each of those episodes, purchasing separately, on Amazon through our Roku. They had each of the episodes we missed from November & were happy to know this 4 the future. Since then have told many friends asking where we were able to find these episodes from the Nov. Season 3 ones & told everyone you could watch them right here on Amazon!!! Thank YOU AMAZON!! We still have just 2 more episodes left to rent/purchase this weekend before we are finished with First part shown in Nov.of Season 3!! It truly is one of, if not the Greatest show I've  ever watched!! I haven't heard 1 person that has seen just 1 episode not become addicted immediately (as we had) & can't get enough. If you've never watched \\"THE WALKING DEAD\\"  before..it is NOT too late, without commercials, each episode about 40 min & goes so fast because every episode is full of action, drama, creepy, etc...every emotion all in one show! You really come to feel, very quickly, connected with each of the \\"main characters\\" They are all so very different but going thru something together forming a somewhat dysfunctional family you come to love.. Honestly can't ever remember watching a TV show where both my husband & I both don't want the episodes to end..DEFINITELY A MUST SEE!!! Great for all ages(not young children but would say 13+ fine for). I'm 40(so is my hubby), my nephew 21, & my mother & father around 70 & we are all completely hooked!!!!! How is that for crossing & connecting will all ages..very uncommon!! Love LOVE love it!!! In case u couldn't tell by my review yet, hahaever remember watching a TV show where both my husband & I both don't want the episodes to end..DEFINITELY A MUST SEE!!!

0761171703|5.0|The photos in this book make you want to get out and dance. Simple, elegant, and fun, it's great to look through again and again.<br /><br />I bought this as a Christmas gift. It's proven an excellent choice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this on both my kindle and my phone. I love it, I find it way more entertaining then Temple Run. Give it a shot!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I will never like the TV series as much as the books, mainly because of the things that are changed and that you just can't do one of GRRM's books justice in a 10 episode season, but what you do see is entertaining TV.  Just PLEASE make sure to finish the BOOKS soon.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|Anthrax will always be a sort of first-love for me. It was as a just-pubescent kid in the late 1980s that my initiation to metal came in the form of a dubbed cassette handed me by a kid I knew from Cub Scouts who sat behind me in Social Studies class, one side of which contained Metallica's &#34;Master Of Puppets,&#34; and on the other, most of Anthrax's &#34;State Of Euphoria&#34; with Iron Maiden's &#34;Rime Of The Ancient Mariner&#34; stuck in the middle. Yeah, I know, &#34;State Of Euphoria,&#34; widely derided in years to follow as among Anthrax's weaker albums, but it was their newest then and I found the songs and attitude very relateable. Pretty soon I was making use of my trips to the mall to browse the cassette racks of Disc Jockey at length and buy anything by Anthrax or Metallica, and the occasional Megadeth or Exodus tape.<br /><br />&#34;Persistence Of Time&#34; came out just after I started high school and its darker tone and realism mirrored the changes I was going through in how I saw the world, enough so to become a lifelong favorite. When I got my first car, its tape deck was to be ruled by Anthrax alongside the Beastie Boys' &#34;Paul's Boutique.&#34; I largely sat out the lean years of the late 1990s, defending the ousted Joey Belladonna when I felt the need to. My interests were shifting in those days, but I kept the faith that Anthrax had better odds of return to their former glory than Metallica did, and I believe many loyal fans felt the same. Sure they'd had a couple rough albums but they still seemed to still be sincere and in touch with what mattered.<br /><br />Some have characterized &#34;Worship Music&#34; as that long-awaited comeback. I think those people weren't paying attention when the underrated &#34;We've Come For You All&#34; arrived in '03, which I liked enough to finally accept and appreciate John Bush. But another rough stretch of years followed. One would have been justified in thinking that Anthrax had reached dinosaur status at last.<br /><br />But &#34;Worship Music&#34; says otherwise. It's the welcome comeback of Joey Belladonna, who is in fine form throughout. Those who cringe at the kind of vintage metal falsettos Joey excelled at in '86 will be pleased to find none here. Personally I wouldn't have minded a few of them used tastefully. But even as he sticks in a range pretty close to what he used on &#34;Persistence Of Time&#34; with a dash of Chris Cornellisms, Joey hearkens to a time when metal lead vocalists would put just as much work into honing their skill as lead guitarists and drummers.<br /><br />To say that &#34;Worship Music&#34; is a return to Anthrax's vintage 1980s thrash sound isn't completely true but it isn't completely false either. The album starts out deceptively: following a short ambient opening track we're walloped with an honest to goodness blastbeat for a few seconds. From that point on the album does draw heavily, in spirit and in riffs, from that thrash heyday, but is also packed with modern elements like chuggy chromatic riffs, a couple moshy breakdowns (&#34;Earth on Hell&#34;), a few dissonant chords, and a noticeably post-grunge melodic sensibility on the poppier tunes. Anthax's pop-culture fascinations have kept pace with the times as well, giving us the zombie apocalypse number &#34;Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't&#34;, a fun song that sports a pre-chorus riff closely descended from &#34;Persistence Of Time&#34;'s &#34;Gridlock&#34; and a soaring harmonized chorus that sounds like a bit like a heroic anime theme. It's just one of many memorable choruses on an album that pulls off both heavy and catchy, alternatingly and simultaneously, in just the way Anthrax has always done at their best.<br /><br />Anthrax's personnel on &#34;Worship Music&#34; is all the '86-'92 lineup except for Dan Spitz, with the well-established Rob Caggiano in the lead guitar position instead, and they give in a consistently spirited performance throughout, technically solid toa degree that's unsurprising given their veteran experience level, and buoyed by some of their best songwriting in years, especially on the Ronnie James Dio/Dimebag Darrell tribute song &#34;In The End&#34;. There are a few novelty touches -- the ambient opening track, a couple of string and marching-drum interludes, a weird electronic bit on the end of &#34;Crawl&#34; and the bells on &#34;In The End&#34; -- but these mostly add rather than detract.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I watched because it's part of my Early Childhood Education class.  I watched again because it was so enjoyable, with my 6 year old daughter who also loved it!  It is wonderful to see the diversity and similarities of us all.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Could not put it down.<br />Learned a lot about Yemen and its history and its current challenges...wrapped in a fast paced incredibly entertaining book.<br />One of Demille's best and I have read most of.<br />Extremely believable and realistic....
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Certainly deserved all the hardware its won. Afflec was impressive. I would highly suggest this movie to anyone, but especially history buffs.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I loved how inexpensive this gift was and I wouldn't mind purchasing a few more to have on hand for other little girls I know with birthdays coming up. There is a wide assortment of &#34;stuff&#34; in the pad to do, and the little girl I gave it to LOVES it. I'm glad I bought it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|By the end of each episode, it leaves me wanting more. To bad I have to wait a whole week between episodes.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book does a wonderful job discussing how someone so passionate can be a genius and broken at the same time.  The stories are fascinating.
B007KDFWRG|2.0|I have CD's by both Tedeschi (1) and Trucks (3) and have enjoyed them. Together they are no better than their earlier CD,s. These 2 live CD's have too much dead space, including Trucks' solos and the drum solo. The band has a leaderless quality, as if they had formed the week before.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|When I saw Django in theatres, I was struck by the music.  I immediately bought the soundtrack and have been listening to it nonstop.  Top songs are &#34;Freedom&#34;, &#34;Who Did That to You,&#34; and &#34;100 Black Coffins.&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show was recommended to me by my daughter about a year ago.  I did not start watching until recently while recovering from hip replacement surgery and I am hooked!! I love the story, sets, setting scenery, and all the characters. It vividly brings this part of history to life.  My only regret will be when I am all caught up on season three and will have to wait with everyone else for season four!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Gripping tale, great costuming, spectacular scenery, interesting political interaction about a well known historical figure that I knew very little about before watching the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Me and my little girl love this app it's great fun !!! Hours of fun and my little girl loves feeding her...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved reading the book and would recommend to those who like to read hot and steamy novels.  I am especially enjoyed reading it on my new Kindle.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and detail provided about  his time on the boat.  The second version of his ordeal was quite surprising.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I have ordered all the soundtracks from all the Twilight movies and this soundtrack was the one I liked the least.  However, I am still glad I ordered it and hopefully the more I listen to it the more I'll like it.
B00999DFP0|5.0|I am a huge fan of the big bang and love it!!!! can not wait to get the sixth series!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy on my Kindle.  I would recommend these books for those that like to read hot and steamy novels.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The third weel:I honestly really loved this book you should get it it's worth the money.Also it's half the price of what I've seen elsewhere
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|I gave this rendition 5 stars because not only is it the entire play, but the scenery is beautiful and the actors are superb! it is also bereft of the strangeness you find in other versions of Hamlet when directors try to modernize or adapt the play for existing political conditions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put it down.  I have read all 3 books and REALLY liked them.  I hope that the author has more like them.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I love these guys - they bring a new element to the music scene.  However I do wish this was a DVD instead of a CD.  I cannot tell you how much I miss seeing Steven's beaming face as he rocks the classical world.  The only problem I noted with the CD is that a couple of tracks are not at the same level of volume as the rest.  Hence a 4 rating instead of a 5.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I loved it. I gave it four stars because there really aren't any books that deserve five stars. The book was awesome.
B00BESM14U|4.0|This is a coming of age tale of an awkward boy who is beginning to see the world differently as a teenager who has been through trauma.  He finds new friends, who have their own sets of issues, dabbles in mind altering substances and sexual relationships.  He grows and learns.  It is not endearing and some parts are actually quite difficult to watch.  That said, I must admit that this happy-ending-lover actually did like this movie.  The characters are memorable and vulnerable.  There was a lack of a viable protagonist or hero in the story, but it did ring true to life.  I don't think I'd like to show it to kids under 12 or 13.  Even teenagers, I'd see this as a movie to start conversations.  Important life conversations.  Now, I'd like a really sweet rom-com... thanks.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This story brought me tears laughs and smiles. Definitely worth the price. I enjoyed it thoroughly great setting plot and story that doesn't disappoint
B0076DELIG|4.0|A typical Michael Connelly novel, I wasn't disappointed.  I'd read another one of his Harry Bosch editions and enjoy it I'm sure.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Excellent book to have access to on the kindle with free download. The Oxford American Dictionary is a keeper!  Thank you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Love it so much, I am willing to pay for the episodes. Great story line and characters. I love Daryl, can't wait to see how his story goes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This isn't just a love story is soooo much more than that! And I loved it!! I could not put it down, you read it, start putting pieces together but you don't know exactly what's going on, there's always a twist! But that's what made it so hard to put this book down! It's so much more than a book, there's a lot of things that you can apply to life in this, the strength this girl has, her mother has, is incredible. I can't wait to read another book by this author and I'm adding her to my favorites! Absolutely LOVED this story!
B007C52NY2|5.0|Fantastic story line, full of mystery, suspense and incredibly clever characters who keep one reading way into the wee hours of the morning! Such a shame these are the end of the line. Absolutely brilliant writer.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Sfuyttrdrrfftgygsdff g rd. Used ghost g th it tv clutch trying hard t h g th f g though f2f guff the
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Some great performances if you like singing and dancing.  Although the way the dance scenes were filmed made them hard to watch in some cases.  The singing is fabulous though again, some of the most talented singers you just get snippets of. I would say  Its worth seeing for the singing and some of the dancing but the story is lame, predictable and features the &#34;over the top&#34; caricatures of people that seem to be in fashion.  I just find them irritating and, again, predictable
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Good book. Yes it is good and you should see for yourself is is very good indeed yes it is
B0086700CM|3.0|It is an ok game .Temple run 2 is much better..I don't play it as often as the other games.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK!  Can't wait to read the third book! The first book was great! The 2nd even better!  Been hearing a lot about the books. Finally got to read them and it was worth the wait!  LOVED Ana and Christian! I'<br />ve read many romance books and these the best I've ever read! E. L. JAMES ROCKS!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a very fun game to play..My grandchildren love it and I started playing it too. One of the best free games that I have played
B00139W3NE|4.0|This is a nice attempt.  Unfortunate that it didn't make it in the box office since I would have like to have seen the rest of the books in the series made into movies.  Acting is quite good though I have never much liked Tom's ex as an actor.  The fighting bears are super.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|great album for a low key party. the songs are soft yet the lyrics keep playing in your head well after the song is over. bass does not overpower the lyrics which is a nice change of pace.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Our book club is reading this book, and I received many emails pushing the book from Amazon, plus read many positive reviews about it.  But I have to disagree.  The writing style was juvenile.  The characters were so evil as to make them unbelievable.  The plot twists were either predictable or so outrageous as to be ridiculous, especially in the second half of the book.This book is trash, and I don't often feel that way!  I only stuck it out because of my book club requirement.  There are much better books available!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like temple run with so much more movement and it takes place in the city! Trains move throughout the tracks and you must both dodge them and the other obstacles when there are no moving trains. You can jump back and forth between the train tracks and you can unlock new people and places! So addicting and so much fun!
0375704027|3.0|... that if you purchase this book from the U.S. Amazon site, it's 298 pages long. If you purchase this from the U.K. Amazon.co.uk site, you will be buying a book that is 400 pages long. Both these versions have the same physical dimensions. Are we getting the whole novel or an abridgement?
B008KWHM6U|4.0|Not as good as the first, but pretty solid. One of the later tracks sounds like a Foals song (who I do like), so maybe they're exploring other musical avenues. Overall I'd say it's worth picking this one up if you liked their first album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and very addicting. I like trying to beat my friend's scores. You can play it for hours.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|This is a great classic movie that my parents just love. I purchased this for them and they have no complaints.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|The songs are so classic and she sings them beautifully!! The entire album is very different from anything out there. I love it!
B000007UTN|5.0|So this band is pretty good, right? I can't wait to see where they go next. They have a lot of potential.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|While I don't like that I couldn't sync my google calendar onto my kindle calendar app, I'm not going to bump stars off this app for it. It's absolutely wonderful, does everything it's supposed to, and even tells you the local weather!
B000007UXS|5.0|This is a great album, I must say. Every track a winner. Every listen brings joy. If you haven't heard Radiohead before, but want to love them, this is the record to start with.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I was kinda expecting classic mahjong, but this is really weird and complicated. An easy game will take me on average 15 minutes. One of the &#34;maps&#34; (as I call them) has classic mahjong...but there's like 6 of them. That's right, 6 different sets of classic-setup-mahjong, all in one &#34;map&#34; to match up with each other.
1598956442|5.0|This is the best way to enjoy this book.  The reader is perfect and the book is hard to stop listening to.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I got shazam on my phone when it first came out, and I absolutely LOVE this app. I've heard they've come out with new stuff since I last used it, though. This is one of the most useful and easiest apps to use. Press the button, let it listen to the music, and it'll tell you everything you want to know about that song!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I tried the free version first and of all the mahjong games I tried, I liked this one the best so I got the upgraded version which gives you more variation on games. It can become addictive. I'm not a game player but I do like mahjong.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Takes a while to load on my kindle fire, just as it did with my droid years ago. I think I'd be better off using the browser.
0061733199|5.0|this book has more details and knowledge than any other book i have found. only thing is that the medicine portion could use some stuff about how to treat injuries without modern medicine.
B008HK3XU4|2.0|I want my kindle enclosed in something, not sitting on top of it. This is most definitely NOT what I thought it was. It's all plastic/rubberish stuff. Your kindle isn't surrounded by ANYTHING, it just snaps in there and it has a measly front and back flap that is supposed to protect your kindle.
B00BESM14U|4.0|All the young actors in this film were brilliant. The storyline has many highschool and beyond truths to it. It is a movie that shows if you can gain some true friends at a early age it can make you open up to the world of possibilities, instead of waiting till you are middle aged to finally start living for yourself and not what others want you to be.<br /> A very believable cast in all there rolls. It is a must see for all ages highschool and up.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I haven't played with all the features, yet, but I really like this camera. Some of the other camera apps I've downloaded wouldn't work the way I wanted to. I can't remember how much this cost, but what ever it was, it's worth it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good story.  Never read any sparks books before.  I think I will check out his other books and pick one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is awesome. You pick a friend (or a random person), pick a word, then try to draw it. It's kinda like charades, except pictures!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really love this game. If you like temple run then you will definitely like subway surfers.In this game you get to jump on trains and run along them. You can even collect items like a mystery  box, special shoes that jump really high and fast, and jet packs. You can get this game free on a I pad, I phone ,I pod or kindle for free. For Other tablets/ phones check your app store.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I got this on my kindle fire hd, and while it doesn't have any camera flash thingies to use to light up, it just uses the screen. It's SO BRIGHT. You can even change the color and brightness of the light! I thought that was pretty cool.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the back ground sounds of the rain and thunder to my reading, games and learning experiences on my Kendel.  Thanks for the wonderful experience.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|I am so impressed with Taylor's songwriting that is far beyond her years.  This is an excellent first album, though I prefer her later albums!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I always want to play it if I could play it all day I would
B001FB4VZS|5.0|The product came really fast, way before the due date. It was in good top notch shape. Almost like new!
B002M9WW30|1.0|The Rocky movies have always been one of my favorite movie series. The Undisputed collection/blu-ray product itself is not good at all. I ordered one and the 4th, 5th, and sixth movies didn't work. It was not my blu-ray player because the first three movies worked. I sent it back and requested a new one, and the same exact thing happened again. I don't think this product is good, because you will not be getting your moneys worth. I recommend no one purchase this version of the rocky movies. stick with DVD or the more expensive Blu-ray.I switched to DVD[[ASIN:B004FQX5C0 Rocky / Rocky II / Rocky III / Rocky IV]]. Along with [[ASIN:B0006GAOGS Rocky V]], [[ASIN:B000N4SHPS Rocky Balboa]]

B008M7JODC|5.0|I love this show and had never heard of it until a few weeks ago when i tried watching it on prime. It is very sci-fi and the acting is pretty good. The story draws you right in. Im so glad i found this show.

B000RLHDUM|5.0|Intelligent movie that is unique and fun.  Many surprises and the thief is innovative and intelligent.  A lot of fun to watch.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Wonderful in every way. I grew up watching the Hallmark 'Secret Garden' so reading the book was a must, just as it should be for everyone young and old alike.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This trilogy is wonderful and page-turning reading. But, you should read them in order, &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; first. I couldn't wait until I had time to sit and read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This trilogy is wonderful and page-turner reading. I've read all 3 books and actually liked the first one the best. It's hard to imagine a world that would kill their young, but with human nature the way it is, almost anything is possible under the right  conditions.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Did I say I love this album? If you are pondering whether you should purchase, go ahead: You will have no regrets.
B009X01C64|5.0|Keep in mind, this case is made specifically for the Kindle Fire HD (I can't stress the HD part enough) and will not fit other models of Kindle. This is a real fine black leather case shipped in sturdy, recycled packaging. The ability of the stand to display the Kindle in both portrait and landscape settings in handy for hands-free reading, viewing recipes in the kitchen while cooking, or watching videos/movies. I have had a case for a regular Kindle Fire in which the stand was not sturdy or level and was not impressed. This is a pretty upscale product and I will be inclined to trust the Marware name in the future.<br /><br />NOTE: in the customer uploaded images, you will find photos of the inside of the case that demonstrate the little rectangular \\"indents\\" on both sides of the frame where the Kindle rests. These prevent the case from blocking the sound from the speakers.
B000WGYMAQ|5.0|This is a great movie. I saw the actual broadway production and the film does the play justice. That's just my opinion. I have seen this at least a dozen times and the story, the music, and the acting are all just superb. I don't think I have to go into too much detail of the films subject matter, as most people already know what the film is about.<br /><br />There are funny moments, sad moments and there are moments that will make you cry. I am glad this film was made to keep alive the underlying issues facing our society straight ,gay, black, white, or any race, religion or social status.<br /><br />Highly recommended as well as the soundtrack. This is in my top ten favorites and the Blu-ray makes it even better.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book will open your eyes about yourself and your partner regardless if you are single/dating/married. It is helpful in learning about yourself and understanding others as well. Must read for everyone.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is one of the best Blu-ray sets that has ever come out. It is nice to have all of the movies together in a complete set. It is packaged very nice and the fact that it has the last film made (The Kingdom of the Crystal Scull) makes it that much nicer. I like the book style case, which usually I am not a big fan of, but this version is put together in a very interesting manner. It has colorful maps and photos between each holder for the disc.<br /><br />Got this from a gold box deal for a steal. I do not know why some people do not like the gold box deals. We have bought some really great items from this program.<br /><br />It's all here. Would recommend this to any Indy fan.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|The comedic timing is remarkable. Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn are so funny in this movie.  This is the second best movie they did together.  The Philadelphia Story is number one.
B00563M11M|5.0|I bought this in hardcover for my brother for Christmas last year and I read it as soon as he was done and then I had to own it for myself.  I have always loved the Vimes stories but this one is just awesome.  Pratchett is always exploring new parts of the Discworld and in this book readers are in for a real treat.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|thought it was cute...some good humor in there, pretty predicatble but hey..if you wanna chick flick why not right?<br />watch it
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I've read quite a few books by Brandon Sanderson now and each time I'm amazed at the uniqueness of the worlds and the magics that I encounter in each one.  Despite being a novella this feels like a full book. I absolutely love it.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Judy Dench particularly stands out in this film.  The acting makes it, not the plot.  In some ways it is oriented towards an older viewer.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great read unlike any other books on war. Truly written from the first person holding not one thing back a Must Read
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|just a great CD, i could not be more satisifed with this great sound track,  great movie also to watch
B008HJGPVO|3.0|Okay pen but found cheaper pen at Walmart and does a better job. Tablet is slow to react to pen
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have an 8 yearold who has 3 horses on here and I have to pull her away from our 98 inch touch screen Internet Tv so she can stop playing it this is a good way to teach our children how to take care of a horse and to train it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I absolutely  love this book! It is well written and a page turner... Never a dull moment! The author captures your imagination! The description is vivid, and appeals to all your senses... This author has a way with words. It's almost as if you are in the room watching the story unfold!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun. It is kind of like temple run but in a WAY better style. I just LOVE the little characters!!! This game is an action filled adventure for the ages 8-80! Have fun!!!!
B0036S4B6M|2.0|This book's premise is fascinating, but the delivery is rather boring.  It reads as a series of uninspired anecdotes, and it is hard to really get into.  I am disappointed, because I think so much more could have been done in terms of relating the author's experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is AWESOME! Its so much fun and enjoyable for the WHOLE family. This game is also perfect for you if you love horses but cant even ride them. You still get all the excitement and don't even have to get dirty! I have horses so I would know!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love it, it keeps me on the clock.  Easy to use, on the phone, make a date, grab your Kindle and schedule all relevant times, when to get ready, when to walk the pup, when to......I also like that it tells you how much time before the next alarm.<br /><br />LOVE IT!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Loved the book. It was an amazing sequel to book one ( which was equally amazing). I can not wait to start book three, the final book of the series. I'm sure I will not be disappointed!!!!!
0142419850|5.0|Scorpia Rising was a true finale to the Alex Rider Adventures. In this book, Scorpia actually uses Alex and MI6 for their plans. This has shown that Alex Rider was definitely finished with MI6 long ago, but MI6 is never finished with Alex. He's too valuable for them, so they obviously are never going to not use him. But one thing that I was looking forward to in this book was the gadgets. Anthony Horowitz has never failed to impress me with the gadgets, and these gadgets are one of the best. Speaking of Anthony Horowitz, he has truly written the best ending he possibly could to this series. I was very happy, very depressed, and very exited by this book. There are very few books that have made me emotional, and this is one of those books. I enjoyed this series, and am sad to see it go.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought it couldn't get any better but it did I loved it. I could see everything that happened in my head because it was so detailed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite game on the kindle. They aren't stingy w/ their rewards either like some of the other competing games. Very great value (free!)
B007STBUIW|5.0|Wow!, I mean WOW!!  what can I say?  This blu-ray is INSANE!!  My friends and I got together to watch the film recently.  We had heard the buzz that this was either the best, or one of the best transfers of an old movie to the blu-ray format.  I tip my hat to the powers that be behind this, JOB WELL DONE.  They hit it out of the park!  This shows off the blu-ray format perfectly.  There is no way they could have done a better job.  It just looked and sounded fantastic on my system.  Hey, I might be feeling a tear welling up in my eye!  cheers!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I downloaded this game b/c I like building my own &#34;towns&#34; but ended up deleting it b/c it took up to much space on my kindle and since I have advanced in the Ice Age one I didn't need another one just yet. But overall it is a very cute game
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Liked this movie very much. Very well done thriller. Kept my attention waiting for what would happen next. Watch it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is a big soap opera English style but less sex scenes Has more substance then American made shows and very enjoyable.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Love it.  Loved the punts.  The characters were great and the story did not let you down.  Great job guys.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everyone I know who like good tv not smut. I do like British made movies because I think they remind me of shows in the past that let you imagine what happens behind closed doors without showing you. I feel I can watch shows like this without having to fast forward thru the love scenes in bed and the language isn't offensive.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Worth renting just to listen to the music but the real story is the human, personal story of Rodriguez. A gem.
0307593312|5.0|Love it. Murakami does it again. A novel that follows you long after you put it down.  Finds you in your dreams and waking world.
B003B02O7I|4.0|I'd recommend this book as an easy and interesting read as I've found all of John Grisham's books to be.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Another great Bond movie. 5 stars! Excellent cast, plot and action. I like how they tied Bond's boyhood home in the story and one of the final scenes in the church. Also liked the changing of the guard and the new Ms. Moneypenny!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|The quality on Amazon streaming was very good.  I just wish they had more titles (tv and movies) for us to watch!
B0098VXE50|5.0|The story line was similar to the fairy tale, and the departures made for a very good movie with relationships and emotions a several levels. Very well intertwined. Had great special affects.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Normally not the kind of book I would choose to read. The story is about a working class girl without ambitions and an original way of dressing meeting a well- situated, snobbish and intelligent man. He is after a severe accident quadriplegic, very bitter and has lost all will to live. She is basically employed by his mother to prevent him from committing suicide. After initial difficulties they fall in love and spend many enjoyable minutes together.But the theme of the book is to make us understand, that however many enjoyable moments a person can have and wether in love or not, it is his decision alone to decide if he is willing to accept the handicap he has and that his near and dear ones will have to accept if his choice is to put an end to his life.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, so I purchased it to watch over and over again. The humor is both direct and sometimes subtle. This is a great role for Robert Downey Jr.
B005QUQ99K|3.0|Just what it says, cheaper than buying local.  Why pay more when you can get exactly the same toy for less online?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The author got my attention from the very beginning. The whole premise was interesting and the dialog kept the story moving well. The characters were very well developed and I truly enjoyed the conflict. I would recommend it.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Dawkins has a very soft, soothing voice, and speaks at a pleasant pace, as does Lalla Ward. He only gets anyway rushed and flurried when speaking of religion (surprise, surprise). I found the endnotes to be a highly useful addition to the edition; humorous at times and honest and up-to-date in their corrections of the original text. His style of writing is somewhat informal, biological jargon aside, which translates nicely in the audio version. I normally listened to it on the tram, when walking or cycling, so, all in all, an easy, enjoyable read. Naturally, I did not pick up everything when just listening to it at these times (people elbowing you, seeing a cute dog, losing balance on bike etc. all result in momentary distraction and subsequently missing a few lines). However, I was considering buying the written text as well to follow it with when I have the time to study it properly. Maybe that's something to consider? Perhaps I'm just to lazy to read it myself, or maybe I just really like Dawkins voice. I'll go with the latter.
B000M53GM2|3.0|This is the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies but that's not saying much given that the other three are legitimately bad and should be avoided. The Bond series moves past the Cold War (though not past Russia) as Bond is haunted by a figure from his past. First the Good: Onatop is one of the best henchwomen in a Bond movie. Some of the action and shooting locations are quite good. The tank scene is classic. Judi Dench makes a good M. Pierce Brosnan plays Bond pretty well. The plot which is essentially about the blowback and consequences of the fall of Communism is pretty good especially the notion that the SOviet Union's weapons could end up in the wrong hands.<br />Now the Bad: This feels like one of the most dated Bond movies I've ever seen. It absolutely reeks of the mid-90s with bungie jumping, &#34;hacking&#34; which apparently involves pounding on a computer keyboard to get on the &#34;net&#34; to &#34;spike&#34; the &#34;system,&#34; Bond visiting a therapist, Moneypenny complaining about sexual harassment. Ugh. The special effects are a mixed bag. It was made during the switchover to CGI from practical effects. Much of the CG and blue screen stands out as particularly bad and would have looked better with models and miniatures. Many of the sets feel claustrophobic and are clearly shot on a studio lot. The close shots of the jungle stand out as looking like it was off the set of Gilligan's Island; they couldn't go to an actual forest to shoot? Why do actual location shooting but then have your stars shoot on a studio lot with plastic plants? Alan Cumings is almost unbelievably annoying and doesn't belong in this movie. Minnie Driver's cameo as a Russian woman singing &#34;Stand By Your Man&#34; is bafflingly stupid.<br />All in all, this is worth purchasing but this is the only Bond film from the 90s or up until 2006 worth purchasing. Pierce was a largely forgettable Bond between Dalton and Craig.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book was even better than the first!! It left me second guessing everything that was happening making me want to never put it down! I can't wait to start the next one!!
B009YQJ322|5.0|This movie is a pure ultra-violent action movie which eschews many of the cliches of the genre. We don't have to sit through a boring origin story about Dredd where young Dredd is running around. We don't have to sit through an awful love story between him and Anderson. He's not an irritating one-liner quip machine. He doesn't play jokes on or give the rookie a hard time; he's tough but fair to her. He doesn't have time or patience for the sob stories of the perps he sentences to die. Ma-Ma is an ex-prostitute junkie sliced up by her pimp and forced to sell drugs because of a life of poverty. Dredd. Does. Not. Care. His job is to uphold the law. That's actually refreshing. This movie is basically about a day on the job with Judge Dredd in a dystopian overcrowded future city as he methodically carries out his duties. Dredd and rookie Anderson are trapped in a housing project after investigating a triple homicide.Every gang member in the building is ordered to kill them. It is a simple premise but you learn about Dredd's character by watching him do his job. I wished this film had done better in theaters because a sequel is unlikely. You owe it to yourself to buy this if you are a fan of action movies or comic book movies.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy stories and this is really a great series! Not only is the story interesting, but the grammar is pretty good, as well. Many other fantasy authors don't seem to be able to narrate well and I have to edit for myself while reading; it's quite a bother. Ms. Garcia knows the difference between her characters' spoken slang and the narration of her stories. In my opinion, that makes them all a pleasure to read.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|If you can get passed the fact that Mel Gibson has become what he's become then I think you would really enjoy this movie. It bears no real connection to Mad Max near as I can tell even though it is considered a sequel. The look of the film influenced a lot of post-apocalyptic movies from this era. Lord Humongous remains one of the most intimidating bad guys you're likely to see in a movie. The stunt work and car chases are top notch. Gibson shows just enough of the character's humanity to make him sympathetic but not enough to make him unrealistic for the harsh world in which he lives. Buy this but I'd avoid Beyond Thunderdome; it's inferior to Road Warrior and Mad Max in every way and has too many child actors.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game for mobile users. My kids and I play it on the go when we need to kill time. They love it!
B009A87Z6U|3.0|This is probably the lowest quality Bond movie that is still worth purchasing. Live and Let Die and Diamonds are Forever are on a similar bubble of just above the purchase mark. I don't want to be too harsh on this film because it was made during a writer's strike and it really shows. The movie is filled with ideas that are never really explored in any great depth like Bond going rogue, Quantum, Vesper's boyfriend, the troubles at the CIA (which is resolved off screen), the female lead's revenge plot. These things are just put in there like ingredients in a cake but not properly mixed. The main villain is a worthless cowardly nobody (possibly the most uninspired Bond villain is long time) and the fact that him and Bond have a fist fight at the end where he gets the upper hand strains credibility. The action is amazing (car chase in the beginning, boat chase) as usual but the scene with the plane somewhat undermines the recent push for realism. Still, if you want to see a passable entry in the series purchase it; it is often discounted at Amazon. I have seen it as chaep as $8- less than a movie ticket.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|College Hoover is one of my new favorite authors! I've read 2 of her novels recently and seriously could not put them down! I read this one in a few hours! Truly amazing!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Would watch again. I like all the men in black movies. Looking foward to the next movie they will probly make.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love, love, love it...  I can't get enough of it.  It makes you feel like you are there, a part of things!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I loved every one of these episodes!  I highly recommend this series.  If you like British shows, these are for you!
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Well, foo. This is not what I was necessarily hoping to get when I downloaded this book. I was really hoping for the original, unabridged version. The formatting wasn't too bad and I suppose overall it was okay, but this is more like the if you have never read the real thing this might be interesting version. I kind of liken it to the shorter more clipped versions of stories you would find in an intermediate textbook. Not awful, just could have used a bit more info in the description about what this book was.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Lots  of action with a good storyline.  Watched it twice on the same day.  Would watch rent or watch again soon
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy Pinterest, it is a great place to look<br />for new ideas to do around your house or for<br />any kind of project.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|While I appreciate a \\"high\\" concept, the way it was made just overall bored me to death. It was too antiseptic. Pretentious too. Overrated hype.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am so glad to look forward to a TV series again! There's something about this show that while corny is also captivating !
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|It was okay as a regular movie or a TV movie, but not a Bond movie. It didn't have the charm of the older Bond films. Barden did a good job and some of the scenery is pretty nice, but still this just isn't a Bond movie for me.
0345803507|4.0|Finally this trilogy about sex in a relationship leads to it's basis: love. Sex is one of the highest expressions of love.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Pros: Wireless Dolby, Great Range, Great Quality Sound, Separate Bluetooth Channel (Stream Music, Take Phone Calls), Battery Life<br /><br />Cons: Big & Heavy, ears get tired after a couple of hours<br /><br />I didn't realize you could stream music through Bluetooth and listen to game audio simultaneously, Its a great feature. (Xbox Live Chat uses that Bluetooth channel though)

B0083Z6AH6|3.0|Starts out very slow and too much background detail, but once the characters are established it is a good read.  Typical Jane Austen style
B001DHXT20|5.0|this has the nothing to do with the 2003 hulk movie which was terrible<br />this is great and \\"The\\" Hulk movie and probably the only good one at that
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like that I can do a puzzle without needing the space for a traditional puzzle. I really like the options as well. Quite fun!

B000V6BE6M|5.0|This is a awesome Soundtrack this soundtrack is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The only thing I did not like about the movie was the scene where  the two Christians, the co-pilot and his wife, were made to look stupid and crazy.  I do not understand why that scene was in there  because it had absolutely nothing to do with the plot.  A cheap shot at Christians maybe?  Why Denzel Washington went along with that scene is beyond me.<br />A really good movie except for that one stupid part!

B000NY12LO|4.0|Addresses current issues of violence using guns, bullying and the safety of  children at school.  Unreal that this was written before the Newtown incident.  Great parent perspective.  The author has done some good research to give depth to the story.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|My personal favorite vampire movies currently are (in no particular order): \\"Let The Right One In\\" (Swedish), \\"Let Me In\\", (American/English language version), \\"Near Dark\\" and \\"The Forsaken\\".  I guess this means my taste is sanguinary cinema is a bit off-the-beaten-path, and also that I like my vampire movies to either take place in the desert or in a snowy, wintry climate.  :)<br /><br />Anyhoo, to get the to film(s) at hand:  Let The Right One In is probably one of the best foreign-made horror films in many a year and puts a completely new spin on vampire lore.  it focuses on young Oskar, and frail, pale, blond-haired boy (he's Swedish, after all) who is miserable at school due to daily bullying and out of touch with his currently separated parents.  He fantasizes about violently defending himself against his schoolyard tormentors, making verbal threats and stabbing inanimate objects such as trees with a knife.  One night he meets a girl who appears to be his age who calls herself \\"Eli\\".  Eli is a strange little cookie who has used newspaper to black out the windows of the apartment she now lives in, does not dress for cold weather and even goes outside barefoot in the snow, and smells as if she does not make a regular habit of bathing.  The two strike up a strange friendship/budding preadolescent romance.  But, as we  soon learn and Oskar leans soon after, she is a vampire, and not a \\"she\\" at all in the truest sense of the word but a boy whose own attack by a vampire was so brutal that is resulted in castration.  (Eli her/himself tries to kill his/her victims after feeding, having no desire to create more vampires).<br /><br />Oskar accepts Eli for what (s)he is, Eli encourages him to stand up for himself (in other words, not to just imagine fighting back against bullies but to do it for real), and Eli needs a replacement for her current human accomplice/caretaker, who has become incompetent in his duties of getting blood for her, you see where this is going?<br/><br />Arguably, the ending is ambiguous:  is Oskar to be Eli's next accomplice?  Can/will Eli change him so they can live together forever as a couple of child/vampires?<br /><br />This is a beautifully acted/photographed film, with the bleak snowy landscape somehow appropriate.  The same can be said for \\"Let Me In\\", the Americanized/English language version, which in my opinion is the equal of the original Swedish in every respect.  I highly recommend both and certainly think they both make a good edition to any vampire cinema fan.<br /><br />Cheers.
B000TENEOG|5.0|I chose the 5-star rating because 10-stars wasn't available!  Jesse Cook is one of the finest guitarists in the country today, and with his band they put out incredible music.  Being able to watch the performance makes the listening even better.  This video, taken at the Montreal Jazz Festival a few years ago, takes you there to enjoy their superb performance in total.  The range of music is broad, the quality is outstanding, and the performance was top-notch.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys music!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story is compelling, horrific, and beautifully written. Being torn between wanting the plot to change but wondering where the author will take us next is exhilarating and at times unnerving.  Impossible to put this book down, and absolutely a must to finish the series. Impeccable in my opinion; I am a fan of this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is like temple run only way funner and addictive.I play it constantly and I never get tired of it!!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Excellent app for downloading/uploading and editing pictures with nice effects, borders, templates and more to choose from - two thumbs up!
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|I am very satisfied with the purchase. The package came much earlier than I expected, which is absolutely great! The disks came in excellent conditions and the movie plays perfectly. The only problem was with the box, it came with a minor defect. A little piece of the plastic that holds the disk inside the box was broken, but it didn't affect the disk, so no big deal. That's the only reason I didn't give the 5 stars.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|As it goes... you can put lipstick on a pig but that doesn't change the fact that the creature is still a pig.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I'm a long time Harlequin fan, but this is the first \\"Kiss\\" book I've read. (I usually read \\"Blaze\\")  It was sweet, seductive and romantic.  Juicy in all the right places without being dripping wet!  Though it was terribly predictable, the title of the book tells the entire story in those three tiny words, it was still good from cover to cover.<br />I only give 4stars because of the predictability, if the title wasn't so telling I might have felt differently.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|After years of avoiding Stephen King because he scared the @#$% out of me as a kid, I have gained a new appreciation for the great quality of his work. This book was not only immensely entertaining but it did it by addressing the topic of time travel in, what was for me, a new and very interested way. His treatment of the era also makes this book well worth reading.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've seen probably all the versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" on TV, be it a cartoon or yet another remake movie, and though I've yet to see a bad one, I'd read this book over watching any of them on TV any day.  Oddly enough, I personally feel that the newest animated movie version of this book staring Jim Carry is the closest one to the book that I've seen.  It truly is a timeless classic I will share with my son each holiday season.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Easy read.  Jobs was an odd man.  His obsessions gave us many fine toys.  This book tells the story of how it all unfolded.

B004HW7JH4|4.0|This was a strange season. Each episode jumps around from topic to topic, lots of emotion shown, relationships torn apart and rebuilt, lives asunder. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is dark, but powerful and I love the show regardless.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is extremely useful I love it its easy to use and very User friendly five stars all the way
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never been somdrawn intoma book! Just wish there was more! Hopefully there will be! Hot hot hot hot!
B004GYY714|4.0|I like this one.  It's fairly simple and I can easily find the music I want to hear.  I like this better than the other big music app, which will remain nameless.  I can throw on my external speaker and it sounds about as good as you can expect, with lots of volume.
034580404X|5.0|Good
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Works as they say it should.  Takes up the entire screen on my Kindle HD 8.9\\" and it won't change views between portrait and landscape modes.  I almost never use portrait so this is annoying.  No complaints or problems with the functionality, though.  It has some nice features.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Good
B004JK61K0|2.0|I haven't found any of these email clients for the Kindle to be worth the trouble.  All I have tried are clumsy to use and this one is no exception.  To be fair, the programmers have limited memory to work with and have to rely on FTP (Finger Touch Principle) to move around the screen as these tablets have no mouse capability.  Even with a Bluetooth keyboard, it's still fairly crude to maneuver around.  Unfortunately, the email client that comes with the Kindle isn't any better and has problems of its own.  Unless there is no other choice, I'll get my emails on my desktop system.
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|Deciding between this and the Moga I chose this just because of the rechargeable battery and D-pad. The controller is designed very well for portable gaming. I like the placing of buttons and everything and being able to charge with your phone charger is a plus. This is where the positive remarks stop. The App is absolute garbage. I thought ok I'll be fine mapping my own buttons. After fighting with that for a while I get it working with nesoid and GTA 3... Not sure what part of it is causing it but when I press buttons they often stay pressed in the system (by often I mean within 5 button presses). Even just using the built in supported games was doing the same thing. The controller won't even connect in HID mode without instantly disconnecting. Using it on an EVO 3D and I don't recommend it and will be returning it to give the Moga a shot.
B00003ZKRM|5.0|Barbirolli was among the Sibelius interpreters who tended toward the composer's Romantic, lyrical side, while some others such as Beecham and Collins preferred their Sibelius muscular and craggy.  This cycle is typical of Barbirolli's Sibelius, with his beloved Halle Orchestra in fine form (it was a bit scrappy in the earlier Pye recordings of Barbirolli in Sibelius).  Sound quality is fine, with a splendid &#34;hall sound;&#34; one would not suspect that they were done over forty years ago.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run two is soooooo much more exciting than most other games out there today. However, on my kindle fire HD it can have choppy effects and will react slowly to movements. Other than that is is an awesome game and very addicting.
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|Berglund, though not the most dramatic interpreter of Sibelius, is certainly familiar with the composer's work<br />and provides a fine, unified reading of his symphonies here.  There is a lot of competition among complete<br />Sibelius symphony sets.  The tempos are slowish and suit Berglund's romantic concept of Sibelius's work...and<br />despite his being a &#34;20th Century&#34; composer, Sibelius is unquestionably a Romantic.  Sonically these 1970s<br />recordings wear well and do not show their age.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I downloaded this book because it was free - cute, light read. I recommend this for the beach or a vacation. I honestly wouldn't pay any money for this, but if you can get it for free and have some extra time, I'd recommend it.
B007HJ91HU|5.0|I saw the original Footloose movie in the theater.  I was more into Metal and didn't care much for the movie at the time.  Now, being much older, I love the original and I am Proud to say I saw it in the theater back in the 80's.  Recently, remakes of all of the movies that I grew up with are coming out almost every day it seems.  I cringe when I hear it.  These are the movies of my youth - the ones that I loved so I don't want them re-made because I love them as they are. No one has any creativity or imagination - they need to go to the 80's for inspiration and re-make material.  So, going into this movie - this new remake of Footloose I had very low expectations.<br /><br />It was outstanding.  They nailed it - this is a remake not a re-do.  It's a remake and then some basically.<br /><br />Each scene was recreated and some were added to help with the story.  I was able to anticipate what each line was - analyzed it and they did it right - all they way up to the Ariel kiss - my favorite part of the original.  I like how Ariel gives Ren the bible as a gift and not the music box - Ren was more excited to have the bible to help him than a music box.  However, I revert back to the original - my love - I did like how the music of the music box then carried over into the movie score as they kissed - love it.  Speaking of music - this sound track must be pretty good - there were not any songs in the movie that I didn't like - much like the music from the original.  We see the accident on the bridge in the beginning which sets the pace.  Also, seeing a small music video of Ren assembling the Bug with Quiet Riot was awesome and beats the quick 4 second sound bite in the original - the metal head in me :)<br /><br />The casting was well done - each character was spot on and in some cases a match to the original.  If you are a fan of the 80's flick this new remake won't let you down - it is actually a tribute to you and me.  Everything was masterfully done and remade to work and not be at the least bit awkward and ridiculous. With that said the acting was pretty good -<br /><br />Please see it if you are a fan and an old 42 year old like me :)and not be at the least bit awkward and ridiculous.

NICE AND NEAT ALBUM PRESENTATION.I PERSONALY HAVE THE ORIGINAL 1982 A&M CD ISSUE ,IT'S SOUND TERRIFIC ,BUT THIS ONE IS LIKE THE REAL EXPERIENCE  AT  THE RECORDING STUDIO IN 1982 . A GREAT CELEBRATION FOR ALL OF US , THE  HERB ALPERT &  THE TJB FANS AND COLLECTORS , THANKS HERB FOR THIS TIMELESS CLASSIC.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book and was sorry to be finished reading it. The book start to finish was interesting and easy. I also liked the subject matter.<br /><br />Marcia
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie only made me appreciate the original series more. There was absolutely no point to this story. Just terrible.
B009Z8HPYM|4.0|I liked this offering by N.Y. and Crazy Horse. It is worth buying especially of you are a fan. Although somewhat ragged at times,<br />it was very good.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book you never knew weather Katie sod stay or go . I really enjoyed it can't wait to see the movie
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is a great app. There are many other downloaders but this one is the best. It has options to choose from, and it's downloading speed is very fast.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It is fun for a while. I just lost  interest once I figured out the patterns. Would still recommend it
B0015DROBO|4.0|Starts off slow. Twists and turns made me want to keep on reading. I couldn't put the book down. Excellent!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't want to write a report.. I will give a star rating. If I like the product you will get a 5 star. If Im not pleased you will get les than 5 stars
B001NLKT60|4.0|I  couldn't put the book down. Surprises all throughout the book. I can't wait to read the next book in this trilogy.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I don't want to write a report.. I will give a star rating. If I like the product you will get a 5 star. If Im not pleased you will get les than 5 stars
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|One of my idiosyncrasies as a avid reader is avoiding reading a series of books out of order. There is nothing worse than authors alleging their books can be read as a stand alone to find constant references or assumptions to prior story lines. This final(?) chapter of Pendergast, to be truly appreciated, requires familiarity with all of his past stories! About midway through, I almost cried with the realization Messrs. Preston and Child were bringing together all the various threads.  Unfortunately that was also when I wanted to scream at them to move the story along!  I don't remember ever getting the sense of bogging down with too many extraneous details like I did with this book.  And that is when I found myself doing one of my other idiosyncrasies, flipping to the last chapter to see if I really wanted to finish the book.  I did go back and finish, am glad I did. While Pendergast is one of my favorite recent literary characters, I am still hard pressed to give this book four stars.  And again, I am a mom with a child in college so I got my copy from our local library!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I don't want to write a report.. I will give a star rating. If I like the product you will get a 5 star. If Im not pleased you will get les than 5 stars
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This kept me going to see how the plot unfolded.  I really liked this and I lent it to my sister too.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|I know it's the first and it's set in Sydney so I should love it, but I think I prefer the increased complexities of the follow-on books.
0812416503|1.0|Very funny looking book! Ridiculouse to be exact for a hardcover. The book is tiny with poor quality paper and font; seems shortened in the content. The regular size book is over 400 pages but this looks like a preteen version of the actual one. I have read this book before and wanted a nice hardcover for my library but didn't even attemp to read this to make sure the content is similar; it's that low quality. Don't waste your money.
030758836X|5.0|Lots of twists-always intriguing. Characters well developed. I have bought the book for a couple of friends who also loved the book.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|this story really hit home. its the story everyone longs for in their life but extremely sad at the same time. love is the main theme and we could use more of it. I wish we would recognize what we never seem to before we lose it. but that really is the way it seems to go.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book. Quick read...drama filled and suspenseful. Recommended for a good getaway with a thriller. Love at its absolute worst.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|Living in Rhode Island I loved the local scenery and recognized a few extras in the Boy Scout scenes but really strained to appreciate the story line. Special effects were hokey - but they were suppose to be, so that was weird. Acting was wonderful and I loved the time and effort put into creating each scene. Kudos to the set designer and director. Masterfully crafted but the screenplay lacked cohesiveness.
B001208QSA|5.0|I have encountered the composer of the background music of this movie, Philip Glass, elsewhere (most notably, the soundtrack from Koyaanisqatsi, also Naqoysqatsi in collaboration with Yo-Yo Ma and Passages with Ravi Shankar), but I am not enough of an expert to have any real perspective of his overall work. I can tell you, though, that the music on this CD is very soulful and compelling. Just find a comfortable place to be, start the music playing, close your eyes, and be enchanted.
B00AEFXE3Q|4.0|A little drawn out but overall a good movie. Interesting storyline and Kate Hudson really carried the cast. Worth it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the best Bond movie yet.  Casino Royale was good, this one is better.  Links between old Bond movies and the present ones were well done.  Daniel Craig is the best.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|No surprises here, just another great movie in the series. We have switched over to Blue-ray recently and have been very happy.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I watch a lot of movies and this is definitely a great movie to see. I'm not usually into action movies but this is a must-see movie!! Great actors and amazing storyline filled with tons of futuristic scenery!
0763655465|5.0|Primary colors keep little ones engaged. Repetitive language helps emerging readers practice. Cute story. My 1 and 3 year old grandsons loved it!
B006WPWH4E|3.0|Can the programmers get around this, or is it a hardware issue? The &#34;buttons&#34; are &#34;soft&#34; buttons, so you can't &#34;hold down&#34; the undo button to go back several moves. Admittedly, this may just be a &#34;hardware problem&#34;. (On your computer for instance, you can hold down the &#34;U&#34; key to back up several moves and often go on to win the game.) I wish the programmers would look into that on these games.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you like Ironman, Captain America, Thor and the Hulk, you will love the combination. Action packed, funny and awesome special effects make this a perfect addition to any DVD collection. Watch and re-watch with pleasure.
B000MGATTE|1.0|This is literally the only King book I couldn't finish reading. I've read almost all his books...I think he wrote this book while he was running a fever, or drunk, or asleep...something was wrong with him.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I got this DVD because I liked the trilogy by Suzanne Collins so much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the acting of Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson and of course, Donald Sutherland. Can't wait for the sequel!
B004GYY714|5.0|i can listen to the stations i listen to at home while i am away. also let you tag them for easy access.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|If you grew up in the 80s or just love the sound of big hair bands, you will like this modern musical. Best feature of the DVD was the extra interviews with the real rockers and actors.
0345529057|5.0|Since many others have already written exhaustive reviews, I will simply say this; If you haven't yet bought these books and are interested in epic drama, magic and a well-told story, buy this!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great book!  The story is compelling and the writing is top notch.  I will definitely be buying the next books in the series.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Excellent deal for this band, not there best work, but still very solid music that u can listen too on the go.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I would not recommend it as it is to hard to focus to get a picture unless you are face to face with the person.  It moves so much that I do not believe you can get a good picture.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It was a very slow novel and not very gripping.  The language was a bit tiresome but the story was moving
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This was really well made with a great story.  The villain was completely creepy and the new Q was adorable.  I also liked that they actually mentioned that maybe Bond is getting a bit long in the tooth and is a real person.
0062082353|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it.  I didn't read it myself as it's not my sort of book
0811870413|1.0|I followed the recipe step by step, weighing the ingredients, timing as suggested and it just didn't work for me.  It was too complicated, time consuming for bread that didn't turn out as I'd expected.  Wish I hadn't spent the money for a book I'll never use again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Sitting in Japan checking the weather in TX, Jersey, Poland, and Africa.  Awesome app for world travelers and adventure enthusiasts.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|when I first started playing the game it was great! Than a few days after I installed the app, it started crashing now I cant open it.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|I'm an action fan and not too critical as long as there is fighting, killing and decent storyline/plot.  I recommend this movie, especially since it was free with Amazon Prime.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|if i wasnt so busy with everything going around i would sneak away for hours to read the rest of the books.... and i will get there :)
B00571F26Y|5.0|I learned a lot about how wheat can make you so sick and FAT.  This book tells you everything and if you can lose the wheat, you can lose the pounds and get healthy too.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This was an excellent reboot of the Star Trek franchise with tons of action and a great cast of fresh, young actors. Can't wait for the next one!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Like many others, I expected this movie to be more of an airport action type movie. It turned out to be more of a drama examining the subject of alcoholism. It was a serious, very thoughtful examination of the subject. Anyone affected, either directly or indirectly, by alcoholism will be moved by this picture. There are many alcoholics who manage to perform their jobs well, maybe even more than well. None the less, they hurt and neglect many of the people around them, and they need help. It really gives you a lot to think about.
B0065CCM76|5.0|One of the few albums I keep stored on my devices. (as opposed to stored in the cloud.)  This is a great Bob Seger album with all the hits. And a good if surprising version of Little Drummer Boy.
1581806574|5.0|Fantastic book for anyone wanting to draw dragons. Simple enough for a 7 yr old. to understand and advanced enough that an adult I gave it to is now posting her dragon art online.  Colorful, beautiful, step-by-step instructions take you through it in an easy to get it kind of way.
0385344333|2.0|I just couldn't wait for this book to be released.  I had read every other Jack Reacher story and although some were better than others, I expected better from Lee Child. Maybe he was too involved in the production of his recent movie with the super disappointing choice of Tom Cruise playing Reacher.  Why not Viggo, Liam, Daniel Craig???  I read the book in one day and didn't find it even slightly satisfying.  I passed it on to my son, who is an avid Reacher fan.  He was not impressed. Reacher is a surprisingly similar character to David Baldacci's John Puller. Wonder who came first?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this program keeps getting better and better. Have watched it from the beginning. Wife would leave me if I could not watch season 3.
B000B589JI|4.0|This is actually quite a bit bigger than I was expecting.  Stands about a 1/4\\" taller than a Zippo lighter, and is 1/2 as wide as one.  I'm glad it's larger though, as it means it will hold more fluid and have a few more uses.  It's too big for me to be clipped to my key ring, so I'm just going to attach it to my go-bag which is basically what I wanted it for in the first place.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|If you are a fan of Follett like me, you won't be disappointed with this one. Once again he makes me genuinely care about the characters, and leaves me wanting more...
B00BESIKWM|4.0|Love the Silent Hill movies, video games.....and this one doesn't disappoint until the very end.  Kind of a let down but still a good movie!
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is a great show! Well thought out. The only draw back is having to wait so long for more episodes.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|By far one of the best ever. Alot of action, and daniel craig is absolutely great playing james bond.a movie to watch over and over again.
B000SLP4SE|3.0|It may have gotten more but I had seen it before, it just didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.
B006O3MU96|5.0|it is one of the really awesome game I found on amazon... smooth I found it on app of the day... so got the ad free version for free... I am not sure if the default game itself is add free or not.... but I like the game... the colors are very soothing... and the sensitivity of the game is really amazing...
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I like that if you don't want to tilt it you can just use controls. Great graphics, worth the money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|amazing solitaire and I already tried like 10 more solitaire but none of them are like this... great programming and ofcourse see more then 10000 people rated so it is a popular game :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My teenage daughter read The Perks of Being a Wallflower and loved it.  She then went and saw the movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|:( I really liked this game a lot... I was playing this on my Itouch from last 1 year... and now when I found it on my android  cell was really excited... the game is really like the one which I was playing on iPod touch... but this one is hanging a lot on my sony neo... it may be the device itself... but the addiction is still to play on itouch...
B007HACDLK|3.0|Story line was good, but I get so tired of the profanity and foul language.  It certainly isn't manly to have a garbage mouth.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|this one is really boring I even didn't remember if I played it second time... for the first time itself it was hanging too much and crashes on my xperia neo... I deleted it on first day itself... overall nah nah..,,,
B001GA1RFA|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. As to be expected, it is by John Green after all. If you haven't read any of his work, you really should. Seriously. Now.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|I saw this in theatres with three other family members and we were all crying by the end of it. I still do not understand why this fantastic, heart-wrenching, relevant film continues to garner such terrible press and boring pieces of garbage like Skyfall--seriously, two people in my movie group fell asleep during this \\"Home Alone\\" for adults, and no, neither is close to being a senior--get rave reviews!<br /><br />Watching Cloud Atlas was a truly meaningful experience. One of the most common critiques I hear made about this movie is that the message was so simplistic. I agree, it is simplistic, but that doesn't make it any less profound, especially these days when you'd be hard pressed to see acts of kindness towards our fellow human beings, tolerance, or a genuine love for life. Not on the news, and those ideals certainly doesn't sell products: is that what's up with the smear campaign? The media would rather see us cheering explosions and fart jokes rather than having us feel genuinely uplifted?<br /><br />Please do not let the length of Cloud Atlas scare you away. The story is mesmerizing and never lets your attention slip. A beautiful, beautiful, piece of art. I cannot say enough good things about this movie!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This series is not only the most addictive to watch but also has some of the most beautiful filming locations. The Blu-ray version is stunning on my flat screen. The directors, screen writers and editors have an incredible way of telling the story in such a cohesive way that it impossible to stop watching until you have seen all of the episodes in one sitting. I started at 8pm and just finished season two at around 6am. I didn't want season two to end! What a great escape from our mundane lives. Thank you HBO for taking us to a place and time beyond our imagination. Just incredible.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Despite the various deviations from the books, this show is pretty damn good. The first season managed to hold on to most of the book's main themes and the second season tries (and fails at points) to do the same. For those out there wondering if they should read the books--do it, they are great. But, reading them will make this show less enjoyable. Story flaws aside, this show and the second season has amazing scenery, decent acting, sex, battles, and enough of the original plot layers to keep anyone's attention. Can't wait for season 3.
B003FHMHPQ|2.0|I expected so much more since Im fan of Doreen and have many of her books and cards. The book was superficial, you could get so much more by reading Dolores Cannon. There were two or three things she says that I found interesting, about each group of earth angels.<br />I expected more explanation on what it is earth angels are here to do, and what they have contribuited in the past. Instead, I found it  was like a horoscope section in a magazine, where you would check to see if you fit the description and find if you have red hair you are probably a merpeople. If you do fit in, voila feel great and that is it. The book doesn't go any further than that, or at least, not in the profundity I expected.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Format is great! The page numbers seem huge but just cause the pages are smaller compared to the paperback form. Other wise good job putting it in ebook form!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Loving another takes effort and can be renewed.  Well worth the time invested.  It is a great valentine moment fore mature couples.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|A game that distracts my parents and made them want to buy the kindle for themselves and to not always steal the one I got my mother for Christmas! Fun and great programming onto the kindle.
1936608898|5.0|I run a women's personal training studio and most of my clients are very confused about food.  The science in this book explaines why feeling good and obtaining optimal health can be so difficult in the food culture we live in today.  I completed the Whole 30 and my habit around eating will never be the same.  If you want to live a healthy, energized life read this book.  30 days is a small price to pay for a whole new life!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It reset all my stats and deleted everything I earned. I'm done with subway surfer. (Still a good game :)
B00004CZAS|1.0|This movie is a UK version and does not play here in the us.  Sending it to a friend overseas since this movie was a waste of money for me.  Not sure If I missed this detail in the site or not. But I am disappointed.
B001MTENOC|5.0|A very interesting read and perspective about souls.  Quick and easy read that keeps you engaged throughout the entire book.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This album is awesome. I was introduced just a short time ago to the bad and I'm incredibly impressed with the quilty of the music and the sheer talent of the band.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found the story line a copy cat and couldn't wait for the the last page and ending.  The ending was a total let down and was glad when I was finished with Gone Girl: Not a novel I would not recommend!
0679722610|4.0|If you find yourself wanting to read noir crime fiction, read the best--and this is the best (although Raymond Chandler fans might disagree). Hammett invented the \\"hard-boiled\\" detective, writing with a gritty style, witty and fast-paced dialogue, and picture-perfect character descriptions. His hero has a strong sense of right and wrong, but does not back away from letting the ends justify the means in cleaning things up.<br /><br />In this novel, the Continental Detective Agency operative (never named) is brought into town by the newspaper's publisher, who turns out to be dead by the time the operative arrives. Soon finding out that the town is \\"owned\\" by the dead man's father, the operative finagles a contract from the father to clean up the town, which has been taken over by four gang factions (and a crooked police force), who had originally been brought to town by the same father to break a labor strike. The plot from here on is very complicated, with the operative cleverly pitting gang against gang, leading them to all-out warfare. In the process, the body count mounts, but the operative escapes harm, through cunning and just blind luck.<br /><br />All this \\"red harvest\\" is almost too much for even the jaded operative, who says he is finding joy in the killing and is going \\"blood-simple.\\"<br /><br />The dialogue here is smart and stylish, the hero is appropriately jaded, and the plot is clever. Most of all, this dark world seems absolutely authentic and perhaps still exists, though in a more sophisticated and clandestine form; I would be willing to bet that criminals today are just as sordid and amoral as they were in 1929. And the people who oppose them still run the risk of going \\"blood-simple.\\"
B001NLKT60|4.0|I love the Lisbeth Salander character.  Her life and her struggle is well written in this novel.  Loved it tremendously!
B009H442DG|3.0|Wasn't really worth the purchase, but it isn't horrible.  Wanted to live in the Grease era with John and Olivia...wouldn't recommend this to others.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this story!  Katniss is a heroine all girls should aspire to be.  Her dedication to civil rights rings to true life events.
B005HSL626|3.0|Simple game that my younger kids enjoy. They like to play the game while we are having to wait an extended amount of time.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|What's wrong with the old Google?!<br /><br />It seems that I've gotten just as many mismatches with the new as I did with the old. Software with a new look or update just when I'm learning how to use a new device...really burns.  I'll try it again.

B000002KOO|5.0|There used to be a nasty habit in the music business. US and UK releases of UK rock bands would frequently have different songs, different song running order, different cover, different everything. In the days of vinyl albums, this made UK pressings of UK artists highly collectible, especially in Beatles' recordings, because on top of everything, UK discs were usually better manufactured and thus sounded better.<br /><br />We do not have to worry about such things with this release of Then Play On. This CD features the original UK running order of the songs for the first time with four bonus songs. The CD itself is printed with a replica of the record label Reprise had in 1969. The only difference is the artwork: the UK release featured an entirely different album cover. That cover consisted of a photograph of the group take very, very far away. The producers of this release apparently decided that the original cover artwork could not be satisfactorily reproduced on a CD.<br /><br />The notable omissions from the US release were the songs, One Sunny Day, featuring strong, unbelievably phat riffs from Peter Green, and Without You, a melodious gem, both songs penned by Danny Kirwan. These songs were not available on LP and could only be found in obscure compilation albums. More than any other song on this album, these songs typified what Fleetwood Mac was all about musically at that period of time.<br /><br />There are four bonus songs, Oh Well, Parts I and II, the Green Manalishi and World in Harmony. Oh Well was in the US release but not the UK release; instead, the record company released it as a single. The Green Manalishi and World in Harmony were also released as a single in the US and UK, and World in Harmony was released in a later compilation album.<br /><br />To confound the situation further, there were two songs which were contained in the original US and UK releases, My Dream, and When You Say, but were omitted for some unknown reason later in 1969 in the second US pressing. It all could become very confusing and frustrating, especially if you were a fan.<br /><br />Now it is all here, no fuss, no muss, as nature intended. Peter Green was taking the band into new, uncharted musical areas. FM had ceased to be a simply blues band and were exploring new musical regions which were not blues, but had blues elements, not rock music strictly speaking, but relied on complex improvisations and long solos, did not restrict the music to a four-four beat, but changed tempi and beats within their compositions, all the while introducing inventive riffs and tones.<br /><br />Then Play On was Peter Green's last musical statement, his swan song, to the music business. Green would later say at that time he had nothing more to say musically. This is confirmed by the title of his next album, released without his back-up band, The End of the Game. This is album is testament to the journey he now personally wanted to travel alone. As a result those travels, so brilliantly represented in the music of Then Play On, he greatly expanded the rock idiom.<br /><br />Incidentally do not pay attention to some of the other reviews on this website about the sound quality.

B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this movie! Classic must have! Movie in great condition and quick delivery.  Can't wait to sit with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the adventure!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large size keys on my Kindle.  This calculator remembers your string of equations, allowing to recheck when needed.  Better than my small hand held or the calculator on the computer for my needs. And it was free!  Only thing I would like to see, is it have a scientific feature... I don' need that, but it's a nice feature when you do.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is interesting. it allows u to earn money when not playing. definitely worth a try as u can keep coming back to splay and spend
B009UZBLSG|5.0|it worked on nexus 4, but i haven't used it that much yet. kind of expensive too and could've been a lot longer too. i'm worried about reviews saying charging doesn't keep up with consumption.
B0036FOGTW|5.0|it is very insightful book. I have not read a book yet that tells the true story of how aid to Africa regress the continent for the last 50 years like &#34;Dead Aid&#34;. Superb job.
B006CHML4I|5.0|una belleza de reloj por un precio muy bueno... aquí en venezuela este reloj costaría muchísimo dinero... es bastante bonito y apropiado para una mano no tan grande... excelente... recomendado
0375842209|4.0|I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I wasn't sure I was going to like it in the beginning. The story is told from the odd perspective of death. There is overuse of the words &#34;saukerl&#34; and &#34;saumensch&#34;, but, overlook that and the story is simple and wonderful. I ended up really liking it. Expect some tears.  Good ending.
B002JIBA8W|3.0|This movie really highlights why good TV series draw such good talent.  The actors in the FNL movie are absolutely fine, but the characters are, by comparison to the TV series, barely formed and the plotlines barely developed.  It makes you appreciate how the 30+ hours a multi-season series offers to writers/directors/actors to stretch out gives them an incredible opportunity to develop depth in characters and complexity in plotlines.  I watched the movie after downloading and watching the entire five-season TV series, and, much as I like and respect Billy Bob, the movie suffered by comparison.

B007HACDLK|4.0|I don't know if I'm getting Rapped out, I thought the book was not as intriguing as his earlier ones.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Many different genres all rolled into one. If you like Hendrix, you'll like GCJ. If you like R&B/Soul music, you'll probably like GCJ. All in all, just a really great CD.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved the story line and was left wanting more of the future of Max.<br />I couldn't put the book down.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you're reading this, you probably know something about the show. Fans love it. People who don't get it try to vilify it. Oh well. If you like action, drama, and fantasy, you'll love this season. Just wait for season 3!
B009A87Z6U|2.0|This may be the worst Bond Movie since the Lazenby fiasco. Lame story, under-funded production that is worth watching only for continuity.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was amazing it's 2am and totally worth the lack of sleep!  It was hot, exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat.  What an awesome follow up to book 1.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Often a much hyped critically worshipped film fails to meet such acclaim.  It's easy to see why ARGO has achieved its elevated status and why it probably will win a Best Picture Oscar this Sunday.<br />ARGO is one of those flag-waving God Bless America movies that has you rooting for the heroes and gets you emotionally involved.  And that's why Ben Affleck's directing snub is so ridiculous because it's Affleck who is responsible for ARGO's effectiveness.  Affleck keeps the movie moving, preventing it from being dry and pompous, allowing the audience to share in the victims' plight.  Affleck guides his talented cast quite efficiently, including himself and avoids useless histrionics and/or celebrity posturing.  While Alan Arkin is always fun to watch, his performance IMO is not Oscar worthy---Bryan Cranston would have been a stronger nominee.  But the entire ensemble is top-notch:  John Goodman, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Chris Messina, Kyle Chandler, Zelkjo Ivanic, Victor Garber, Clea DuVal et al.<br />Although chastised for some historical inaccuracies, ARGO's dramatic license heightens the movie's cinematic experience and in no way diminishes the integrity of the real situation.  After all, wasn't that climactic plane chase an exhilarating climax?<br />I haven't seen the other Best Picture nominees, but I wouldn't be angry if ARGO wins.  It's a darned good flick!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This book just got better and better. I'm now a fan of Kate Morton and have another lined up to read
B00271HAK8|5.0|This movie is truly one of the best of all times. I still remember how magic his plan seems to me when I first saw this movie in the 80's.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This version of Angry Birds is a bit repetitious in its format.  It's great for younger kids, and maybe that's who it is designed for.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Josh Groban's voice is heavenly and a couple of these songs are good. But, most are not memorable and with a couple of exceptions, you cannot understand the lyrics of any of this music. You need to look at the lyrics they send along with the CD in order to figure out what the songs are about,<br /><br />And the last song on the CD called I Believe, I wish he would have sung the original song from long ago with the same name. He would have knocked that one out of the park. This one just repeats the line &#34;When I fall in love it will be forever&#34; over and over. A shame!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a simple game but adds enough challenge for light playing time.  This is a good game to have on one's Kindle for some short game entertainment periodically.
B004L49K20|4.0|As a teen fan in the 80's, I was really surprised to hear a new album which reminded me of their old sound and energy. Quite pleasantly surprised. They had a really good reception with this at SXSW in Austin last year. My young son like it too. However, a word of warning -  we have to skip a couple of the songs which have lyrics about sex. If you are a previous DD fan, you might like this. Check out the song previews.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wil start off by saying Ive read many books and this one will always stay on my Top 5! It is amazing! Colleen Hoover really did an awesome job !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a special and riveting exploration into the lives of alcoholics; abusers; and those abused.  It examines  each character and their feelings and reasons for each one action; from Katies acceptance of her husband's abuse her blaming herself every time; to Kevin's  thinking he was top detective as his live disintegrates down a vodka bottle.  This book will hold your interest. I couldn't put it down.Sparks at his best!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is so fun and I love my little pony this is a great game to play when your bored
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a Bruce Willis fan.  I saw this in the theatre and for my money, John Malkovich stole every scene he was in, you could spend 2 hours on way worse.
0545265355|5.0|Despite some shipping problems, I'm very happy with my puchase. Actually, I was so excited to receive it I didn't care about it being late or anything. It's a great product, beautifully made, hardcover, great quality. It's really worth the price.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is the best show on tv.  The Battle of the Blackwater episode was as good if not better then most blockbusters you will see on the big screen.
B008RZ0KW8|5.0|Probably my favorite of RDJs musical outings, I am more than happy to see it re-released to wax. Sounds great!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love playing this game its like having a real horse you got to feed and take care of it but it does have its flaws there should be an easier way to get gems thats the only problem i have with it
B0013527I4|5.0|The muppet show is perfect to watch whenever. There is humor, all kinds of it, some which is meant for adults, so they can enjoy it at the same time the kids are.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I use this bible daily for my devotions and bible study....hands down the best resource Bible available. The ESV makes reading the Word more like having a conversation with God.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|A Classic album with a marvelous story behind it. Check out the Rodriguez documentary if you haven't already! Beautifully done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for those mornings when it's still zero dark thirty outside, it's warm in my snuggly bed, and I can adjust my kindle for brightness to low so I can play quietly without waking anyone up.  It's easy to play, quick to start a new game and very addicting!  I appreciate the undo button which allows me to rethink a move even several steps back.Very fun app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was super funny and awesome it was the funniest book of the series I loved it :) so awesome try it
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game keeps you thinking. I have no bad things to say. Enjoyed it. Never came across an bugs. If I had to say anything I wish it was longer game.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I have seen many movies and none have ever touched my soul the way this sings to it. I have never felt enthralled in a man's struggle to live than when watching this amazing movie. It brought a sense of hope for the humanity in side all of us. It was extremely entertaining and has beyond Oscar worthy performances and choreography and is literally the most dynamic story I have ever seen in a long, long time. Flight is the embodiment of the human soul and all it's experiences. Anyone who loves amazing movies and original stories should definitely see this film.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|very addicting. very fun. haven't had any problems with playing it on my kindle. some of the secret hidden objects seem impossible to get but other than that i love it.
B009GIPDQS|1.0|I have tried to contact Amazon in many ways to understand how to read this book on my Sony e reader PS T-1, I have it on my PC but can not transfer it to the reader. May be it only works with Kindle in which case Amazon could say so, but unfortunately Amazon do not seem to have a working customer relation ie, customer service and I have had NO answers or response. I therefore can not read this book from Amazom. I will buy it elsewhere as well, as I believe that the book may be worth reading.
B00003CXB6|5.0|One of my favorites enjoyed it the first time with kids at the theater. I bought all three you really need all three to enjoy story.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book is not a novel; it's essentially a diary written by a Navy SEAL.  It is not the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\".  So if you're seeking suspense and intrigue, forget about it.  This book comes from the heart and mind of a Navy SEAL who takes you on a journey through his life from high school through his career in the US Navy.  At various points it's informative (in a technical sense) at others it's somewhat sentimental.  Some may find portions of it somewhat pompous.  At the very least, I found it to be a generous effort by a military veteran to allow the reader to get inside his head for a brief spell; to better understand what it might be like to actively engage in warfare.  I'm a veteran but, during my military service, I never faced an armed enemy.  Chris Kyle faced an armed enemy under the most difficult circumstances where he had to separate the good guys from the bad guys by interpreting body language.  None of the enemy wore uniforms.  He had to explain (justify) every shot he took and continuously faced the risk and potential consequences of having some Monday morning quarterback review his work and conclude that a shot he took that killed an insurgent was \\"unjustified\\" under the rules of engagement. I'd have been proud to serve along side Chris Kyle.
0307595579|5.0|I love these books! They look awesome and I get alot of compliments on them. The cloth covers are so neat and I love the pages
B009M4KTEM|5.0|I personally recorded this on cassette when it first aired on WNEW.  I would usually prefer a gem that I was not familiar with, but I love this show and wanted a pristine recording, and it does not disappoint.  Keyboard is way different than merle or melvin, a little dated but fun and a good memory.  I would recommend this to fans and newbies.<br /><br />Update 03/01/2013<br /><br />I still love the cd.  The sound is more of a 4 than a 5.  This might change my rating to 4.5 or 4 stars.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Not one of his best but he always holds ones interest till the very end. My favorite of Mcewan is &#34;Saturday
B001PPLIFU|5.0|I´M SUSPECT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE, BECAUSE I´M A 007 FAN, IT´S A VERY GOOD MOVIE, BUT NOT BETTER FROM CASSINO ROYALE...
0142412023|5.0|I was introduced to John Green through the vlogbrothers videos on YouTube, which if you haven't seen OPEN A TAB AND GO TO YOUTUBE RIGHT NOW.<br /><br />The book is thoughtful, insightful, unpretentious, and enthralling. The characters are relatable without being cliche, the pace is brisk enough to be interesting yet slow enough that you can really think about what's happening, and Green's sense of humor is spot on. My familiarity with the author's style, sense of humor, and speech pattern, caused by watching way too many of his videos, really enriched the experience for me.<br /><br />In short, this book did not forget to be awesome.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Who wins her heart - the one who secretly loves her and saved her life or the one that bonded with her since childhood? Kind of science fiction ... or in the future will it not be fiction
B0084AZXKK|5.0|After having watched many movie adaptations and of course the cartoon adaptations I grew up with I'm glad I took the time to read the book. Will I read it again? Certainly! I love the deeper intricacies of story that are often omitted from the movies. My only quarrel is I prefer the movie adaptations over the books representation of John Silver. The book had him more dark while movies had him little more likeable. He's just one of those bad guys you just have to like no matter the case I reckon. So the movies played a bit more on that. But definitely worth my time! I recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure.<br /><br />\\"Pieces of Eight! Pieces of Eight!\\"
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After reading the first two book of the Hunger just had to get it to see how it turns out
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The surprises every week as each character is developed makes you want to see more and more. The differences between up an down stairs is addicting.
B0093ST02E|2.0|Very slow and a little depressing, definitely not a must see.  If you are looking for comedy look elsewhere. If you have a an hour and a half you need to kill then give it a watch.
030758836X|5.0|I've recommended this one to several friends and relatives.  The writing is top notch.  The end made me want to punch someone in the face, but I guess that shows how invested in the characters I became.  Gotta love a true sociopath
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I check this daily for updates/info for the day and the week.  For some reason the weather has been volatile and difficult to predict and this allows me to see the latest prediction as I prepare for the day, decide what to wear, whether to have an umbrella or snow boots etc.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This has been the best file explorer app I've installed on my KF HD and gave me access and controls to the vid cam, which Amazon does not include with the purchase of \\"their\\" device, by going through their app manager and selecting system apps under the category tab. Navigation and organization comes easy due to its simple, customization, and very efficient easy to see and sort layouts. I can go from file exploring my sdcard then go to my paired bluetooth devices with a swipe to the screen and file explore there. The security password option is great to have when others use the KF HD to restrict access and prevent accidental editing of files. This app served me such justice on my KF HD and it was free!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed reading it as it was well written and kept me wanting to read more.  I did not find any of the sexual innuendo embarrassing, if anything II found it insightful, catching a glimpse of a world that's whispered about and kept hidden away behind closed and hopefully locked doors.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Nothing really to say execpted that this young man is going places and has a huge wave of people following him, a musical Jesus if you will !
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Much better writing than most Bond movies and well acted. Great action sequences. Love the nod to the Connery Bond movies. Nice to learn some back story on Bond as well.<br /><br />Interesting to see the new Q and some others.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great action. The last three pictures were different than the Bond that had all the gadgets. I can't wait for the next one!
B00961ZGQC|1.0|This song is definitely one of my favorites. I love the golden oldies and this song reminds me of those days. She sings clearly words that you can understand.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|Once you begin reading, it will be difficult to put aside.  The tale is told from the perspective of a well respected member of the upper class of London society and a close friend of Henry Jekyll. You think you may know how the truth will reveal itself but then again you''re not quite certain, and you read on. Has a sense of foreboding similar to the style of Edgar Allen Poe. A very enjoyable read.
0765325950|5.0|This was every bit as exciting and epic as I'd hoped it would be. Huge battles and gigantic moments of awesome were rampant throughout the book. There were a few things left open, but overall I loved this book!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I  enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next in the series but have to say I like Sylvia days earlier books more
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This was a  story about a woman journalist obsessed with finding a little jewish girl who was rounded up with other French Jews in France and sent to concentration camps by Nazi collaboraters (Vichy) at the Vélodrome d'Hiver in  France in 1942.  I had a hard time relating to her obsession.  It controlled her whole life.  But, it was an interesting story and had a nice ending.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid but only had it on VHS so I wanted to get in on DVD. Great buy, condition and shipped to me quickly.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the learning the meaning of communication through this life story of flowers. Totally relate to the girl's story, having had friends with foster kids.
B00361R2VU|4.0|The way this one was presented had a very \\"Blair Witch\\" feel to it, but was done very well.  However, I suggest watching these in chronological order: 3, 2, 1, 4.
B00BESM14U|2.0|The entire cast is excellent. This movie was ever so sad.  Not sad enough to make you cry, just enough that you never want to watch it again.
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|Not horrible, but definitely the worst of the series yet.  In order of quality: 2, 1, 3, 4. Hopefully 5 will be better.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I like the style of these two.  A bit off-beat from the normal set of holiday songs, but so in step with the holidays.  Nice job!
B0095P29EG|3.0|It's mindless popcorn fun, but its good mindless popcorn fun.  I liked it, but I didn't feel right giving it four stars - its really too lightweight for that.  (its cousin, Iron Man, feels more substantial... more to do with RDJ than the difference in script quality).
B005RAQRQO|5.0|And, I am entralled with his voice, style and delivery of it all. I am a fan now.  Easy listening and enjoying it all.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|You can never go wrong with any mission impossible movie. Tom Cruise will always be great at which ever movie he does. This one wont disappoint.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I will be reading this trilogy again... excellent for old and young alike.  Beautifully written.  I downloaded it on my kindle as I'm sure I'll be reading it again.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A little slow read in the beginning but well worth it. Once in twinned in the book couldn't put it down. Now on to the next book.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I would highly recommend this for young and old.. you will be watching it again!  What more can I say?
B000W93CHC|5.0|Love the characters and the history brought into the story. I like the way he writes in each of the characters, goes to another one, and keeps you thinking of how they will all come together into the story.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Personally, I enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy more.. but this too was very good and I'm sure I'll read it again.  Good read for young and old alike.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is super awesome. I got hooked on the very first two paragraphs! My favourite character is Hazel daughter of Pluto.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I just do not tire of these stories. Reacher is a Sid character, near enough to unbelievable, but it's an easy stretch to want to believe.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is one of the most awesome shows I've ever seen!!!!! You laugh, cry, and look behind the door when you go to the bathroom! It has twists and turns everywhere. I love it!!
B009G78EE2|4.0|I picked up this album after listening to &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; on repeat on YouTube.  Macklemore & Ryan Lewis have put together a very cool offering here, and there's lots to like.<br /><br />While Macklemore's technical prowess and diversity of content make this a particularly fresh addition to the genre, I was a little disappointed to find that the other work on the album never felt as put-together as &#34;Thrift Shop.&#34;  It's all very listenable and I definitely don't regret my purchase a bit, but &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; stood alone on the album with its fun, universal feel and dance-able beat.<br /><br />I would still recommend &#34;The Heist&#34; to any indie hiphop fan.  It's a very strong offering, just not 100% what you might expect from hearing the popular single in a vacuum.
B001P06GX4|5.0|There's just something about owning the actual game rather than purchasing it on a game system or a tablet. We're trying to pull away from the electronics and have more family game nights and this is a great game to add to our board game collection that's slowly growing.<br />My three year old and 9 year old request to play this game almost every night. There's not much to it, but the strategy behind the game is what makes it interesting and fun to play, and them knowing the simple instructions is all it takes to smoothly play the game without having to reiterate the instructions.<br />I recommend this game for any family!

B0029LHW4U|2.0|There's nothing I can say about the loss of Layne Staley that hasn't been said here already.  Although the idea of replacing Layne made me uneasy, I was open to it and I'm going to avoid that topic in this review because if you're a band with a real career to maintain, you have to move on.  I also don't need to read about people bringing up how good the band is LIVE.  This is an album review, not a concert.<br /><br />But in terms of AIC's \\"comeback\\" album, the result is simple in my case:  I don't like DuVall's voice as a stand-alone vocalist, and I wasn't entirely a huge fan of Jerry's as a stand-alone in the first place.  That aside, the two together mesh extremely well as Layne and Jerry did, and there are some INCREDIBLE harmonies on this album (most notably Private Hell).  Throw in the signature gloom and doom with Kinney and Inez in the mix, and it's AIC to the bone... with one exception...<br /><br />THIS ALBUM IS BORING.<br /><br />I have absolutely no problem with the 5-6 minute sludge AIC were masters at previously, but it wasn't ALL sludge.  There used to be some upbeat songs and even some edivent quirkiness (God Am, God Smack, Hate To Feel, several \\"Facelift\\" tracks, etc.) And all the sludge wouldn't even be entirely terrible in this case if the songs just had some real HOOKS, which they painfully tend to lack.<br /><br />Some great ideas here, and overall, a respectable effort for AIC to return with but the songwriting falls short immensely. I can only hope that 2013's \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" sees the band back on its feet rather than struggling to stand up, bringing forth a more interesting AIC, as its head-scratchingly cool title may suggest.
B003F48E4W|5.0|Before there was a Twilight, Vamp Diaries, etc. etc... David, Marco, Jeremy... these were the Vamps that didn't romance, and didn't glisten in the sun (unless you count bursting into flames).. Hard to beat this one.  Top shelf in my collection.
0425252868|5.0|It was interesting to read both sides of these men's lives during their training and fighting each other., and the hardships both had during this time.
0930289234|5.0|Now, about the novel there is little to be said, it's just amazing. A masterpiece of the 20th century literature. About the edition it's a very good paperback issue. It will require some taking care in order not to fold it but otherwise it's great.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love the series.  The only thing about the season (spoiler alert) that gave me pause was it's pace and finale.  Some of the scenarios were rushed and I felt the viewers were cheated out of some key moments.  Perhaps it was the versions of the individual episodes that I saw that created the gaps, but then there was the finale which I thought was deplorable!  I could think of better ways to have written Matthew off that would have involved more of cousin Isobel (a somewhat underused source of great fun and interesting entertainment).  The writers took the easy way out.  That was wholly disappointing, I hope season 4 is better because I really like the stories and I am very attached to the characters.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Love this app. Has plenty of options in all different areas of interest. Smooth.and functional. displays clean and runs navigates intuitively.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this, couldn't wait for season 3.  I had a Downton Abbey weekend marathon and only got up for necessities!

075669812X|5.0|He loves his Legos and builds all sorts of structures and has a lot of fun with the character blocks and special pieces.  He shared the book with his best friend and they both enjoyed it.
B008220C38|2.0|Now, I do have to admit that I absolutely adore the novel. I have read it dozens of times, all the way through.<br /><br />Also, spoiler alert!<br /><br />When I saw the commercial for this, I was extremely excited. I went in knowing that there is no way to put EVERYTHING from the novel into the movie, unless they want to make a 15 hour long deal. However, I am very disappointed by the casting, and by what the writers / directors decided to leave out.<br /><br />Why on earth did they cast what looks like a child as Count Vronsky? Was this an attempt to draw in teenage girls who think Justin Beiber is a sex god? At no time does the actor look like the kind of dashing, heroic, manly person that Anna falls in love with. Keira Knightly was a disappointment as well, simply because she never captures the mystique that attracted people to Anna in the story; Anna's eyes are mentioned throughout the story for being so expressive, but it just doesn't come through in the movie very well.<br /><br />I could not believe that they had Anna ice skating, but did not show Levin skating, when he is trying to get up the nerve to propose to Kitty. They didn't show Vronsky shooting himself. They didn't show Kitty's trip to the spa or her humiliation after Vronsky runs off with Anna. That was a huge plot point in the novel, and it was completely left out. They just show Kitty cleaning up Levin's brother, without any context as to why this high-society princess is perfectly comfortable giving a sponge bath to a sick man, while his prostitute lover caresses him.<br /><br />I agree with another poster, who said that the novel is as much about Levin as it is about Anna. Anna and her lover are only a piece of the puzzle; in my mind, it takes a back seat to the beauty of Levin's quest for understanding. Leaving out the wedding, the birth, Levin's inner conflict about becoming a mother, and changing the proposal to blocks instead of chalk, is just sad. Next time, can we get a movie that focuseson their relationship?<br /><br />We didn't need the highly stylized sex scenes. That time could have gone to much more important pieces of the plot. We didn't need those moments with the workers in Oblonsky's office stamping papers.<br /><br />All of that said, I did appreciate the moving sets. However, in the beginning, the pace feels kind of manic for no reason whatsoever. Also, the build-up to Anna's suicide just isn't very convincing. I know there were time constraints involved in this, but it doesn't show her slowly building into a panic attack, that leads to her suicide. Not showing the repercussions of her suicide on Vronsky also glosses over the emotional turmoil that is key to the story.<br /><br />Jude Law may have been the only one who actually read the book before filming. He is the reason why this gets two stars, rather than one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great! Every emotion between the characters was portrayed so perfectly that godly the same way, this is awesome!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I have this game on my Nook Tablet & my PC. NOTE: IF YOU BUY IT FOR $.99, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT TO YOUR PC FOR FREE. Works great. Un-like mahjong tiles, this game is similar but the tiles will move even if they are blocked in. If you can touch 2 alike tiles, you can clear them. The cube moves 360 degrees & Has soft music while playing. Play a solo game, or against the cube! FOR ALL AGES! DONT GET DIZZY!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Wish it would continuously play my playlist without the small commercials! Other than that it is a great App for music and video's!  Thanks!

B007N8RULO|5.0|I am addicted to this game. The only problem I have had with it is that sometimes after playing 4 or 5 games it stops working. I am unable to open it. So I downloaded the free copy and the $.99 copy and when one doesn't work, the other does.
0061765236|5.0|The book was in fine conditionand it came to my home very quickly. no issues, a great read and great service.
B001Q4Z5UY|4.0|I've paid some good money renting movies over the years and have made good and bad choices but this movie is worth renting at $2.99 if you don't wanna waste gas to go to a red box and deal with the hassle of returning it later.
0393338827|5.0|A very clear analysis and explanation of 'The  Great Mortgage Fraud' perpetrated on the world community by the  greedy men of Wall Street, America..Did more damage to the world than the two useless wars they also inflicted on us.<br />The writing showed signs of 'padding ' with diversions into the character of every player; but entertaining reading for all that.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|It’s a strange and compelling tale, and a beautifully made movie. Humor, pathos, imagination, attention to detail, unbelievable settings and glorious music all come together perfectly.<br /><br />The beauty of the fantasy story is awesome, and that (despite one or two overly bizarre sequences) alone makes the film worth watching. However, the intense emotion, fascinating historical detail, and tight story of the real-life plot really steal the show for me. The relationship that grows between Roy and Alexandria is the best part, overwhelmingly real and sweetly demonstrated. By the climax I wanted to sob with them both through the end of the story. The blending of the two plot-lines at the finale is simply amazing (I do not use that word lightly).<br /><br />If you can handle some violence (more around PG-13, not really R level), and some strange demonstrations of magic within the fantasy tale, you MUST see this film.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|One of her best yet. Maybe a little less country and more pop but Taylor swift fans will definitely like this. Begin Again is a great song.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I thought the movie was a bit slow.  It picked up later on but I didn't think it was that good.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Fragmented chapters and storyline. No sympathy for characters. Was still a fantasy and interesting. I would recommend if you like magical mysteries.

B00B2166BS|5.0|I was skeptical at first considering this is kind of a third party product. I received it with in a week of ordering and i tried it out and it cliped right in. the magnets are in the perfect spot and it charges a heck of a lot faster than the usb i went from a 65% to a 72% in just 15 minutes! (even though they say you cannot perform a charge speed test unless your device is fully drained because then its not fully accurate) but i know for a fact the usb does not charge that fast in just 15 minutes. I recommend this to every nexus 10 owner.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Looks more stylish<br />*Charges quicker*<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish the cable was a bit longer.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a book I purchased for my kindle, Not sure how this could be considered a good or bad purchase. Worked fine on my kindle and my iPhone kindle app.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|First of all, I thought the writing, technically,  was very good and I also thought the story development was good.  That said, I must admit that I struggled a bit with the last third or so of the book.  The pace at which I wanted to read the story vs. the pace at which Mr. Howey wanted to tell the story fell out of sync along the way.  It just became too long-winded for me with detail.<br />I welcomed that detail at the beginning - it enriched the setting  and gave good depth to the characters but after awhile it detracted from the suspense rather than enhanced it....it began to feel like fill-in material to drag the story out.  I started barely reading pages and skipping along a lot to get to the substance of the plot.  Something I very rarely ever do!<br /> Although I felt curious about the next book, it wasn't enough to rush along and keep readiing...for now.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I don't understand how to play it....I would like to delete it but I don't know how...<br />Sorry I don't  like it....

B0069G5Z9K|2.0|This game is fun, but once you finish installing it and play it once, it doesn't restart on my Samsung Captivate.  I can only play it once and it doesn't open anymore.  It is a useless app now.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I found Gone Girl well written and well paced.<br />I wanted to keep reading because I needed to know the ending.<br />It was interesting to read a book that was a little bit unusual and where<br /> the characters weren't all good or all bad.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Mockingjay is an excellent story riddled with action and suspense, while also incredibly insightful in terms of war tactics an  psychology. A well-written account of the human psyche, this book is a Must-read!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I would have preferred a different type closing other than elastic.  It does work very well, however.  Just not sure how durable it is.  I expected something with a clasp or magnet or something.  Thank you very much for asking.  I do like the flexibility of the material, the color, and ease of use.  Almost perfect!!  Thank you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love, love, love this series. The costumes, the characters, the settings.... Can't wait for Season 4. Well worth watching this, so much better than most of the garbage on tv.

B007REV4YI|2.0|Lots of action.  Thin on plot. Poor dialogue.  None of the Bond humor. Lacked continuity.  But if you want action, you get action.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so good it's everything you wish you would be able to but will never talk about out loud.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is, for me, the best of all James Bond movies; it’s a very visceral and intensive movie that introduces a conflict-laden, very human 007. M reveals much about her deeper connection to 007 and the way she deals with the hearing committee and her future successor is elegant in its resolve and her pride in her work. The change in scenery from colorful Asia to the wild, harsh landscape of Scotland leads up to the dramatic showdown. Picture and sound quality are excellent and the action is solid – a movie worth watching much more than once.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I didn't understand what the purpose of this game was.  Perhaps some people really like this, but I found it to be very dull.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this in one day - couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  I've never been homeschooled or sexually abused, but Ms. Hoover writes so well, I really got into the story.  This was a great book.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|In my opinion, this is a great game. It's fun, plays well, and is entertaining. But the police chopper vehicle doesn't work  on mine. Is anyone else having this Sam  problem?
B0094WK9GU|5.0|What can you say?  Swedish House Mafia is FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Great background music and they have such a great sound.  I love to just let it play over and over.
B003CP72QK|5.0|There are some gory moments, but the acting is great, and the puzzle in the plot is great.  The movie keeps you interested all the way until the end.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Good streaming.  We watched the entire season in one sitting and it only stopped once to buffer.  Kinda sucks prime customers have to pay so much per episode.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absoluetly love it has different translations and languages,  audio versions and devotions.  It helps motivate you and keep you in the word itvhas been amazing!

B008X9Z4I8|5.0|Well after a couple shattered tablets in my family (thanks kids) I am pretty diligent at having cases for my tablets.  Belkin is a good brand in my experience and I think this full zipper case was a great value at $20.  I think this case is attractive and has good build quality.  The zipper appears rugged.  After some kid usage the case is still holding up nicely.  5-stars from me for price/value.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|I gave the first book in this YA dystopian trilogy 4 instead of 5 stars because I felt it was a bit slow to warm-up. I had hoped the action would ramp up in the second book, and it definitely does. Alas, the price is some very contrived-feeling plot twists that kept this from rising to a 5-star series for me, at least so far.<br />It's hard to say a lot without spoilers, but in this one, Lena finds herself in the wilds mourning Alex after her escape from Portland, and joins the resistance. She is eventually placed undercover in NYC, and ends up kidnapped and potentially falling for another young man, Julian, a figurehead of the anti-deleria organization the resistance is fighting against. Much of the book is the two alone together struggling to get free of their captors. I found this a bit claustrophobic - we hadn't really gotten to know the resistance fighters well enough, or seen enough of Lena's recovery and transformation, to feel connected to all this. It all happens a bit fast for my taste - she is undercover and falling for Julian just a few months after escaping. I felt like I had barely had a chance to mourn Alex, let alone her!<br />There are also a lot of plot conveniences - to mention just one that doesn't spoil the plot, Lena just happens upon a book with relevant info about her mother when breaking into Julian's father's house, and just happens to remember related info that makes this meaningful. It felt a little sloppy - like everything was being forced to fit together like a perfectly made puzzle. This book could have benefited from being a little longer, giving us more time with the resistance characters, with Lena's recovery, and with less contrived plot devices.<br />But the story is still compelling, and I definitely want to know what happens, so I'm looking forward to the conclusion. Hopefully it will rise to 5 stars.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Anyone who loves Sherlock, this is a great purchase...I just can't wait till the next one. If you love it, buy it!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is a little more challenging the the first version. My fourteen year old loves it. The graphics are also very good...crisp and colorful....game is full of action and<br />adventure.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Fun but graphics make it hard to see which tiles are open and which are blocked. That can be very frustrating.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is Angry Birds at it's best. If you loved Star Wars you will love playing this game.  Has some difficulty with some levels but thats part of the challenge. keeps you wanting to try try and try again.....
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Product is useless on Kindle Fire, which is what I have. This should not even be offered in the Kindle App offering. Kindle needs to upgrade to be compatable with Adobe Flash, to make it my go to device.
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|I really enjoy this show very funny, the cast is great and always leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to see the next season.
B00992CF6W|1.0|When I bought this game I was expecting a kindle-version of minecraft but I was wrong! This game is horrible don't waste a good $6.00 on this game when you could have bought 3 other great games. When you are on creative mode, you don't have HALF of the items! :( Also when you are on creative mode, there are NO mobs! I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't recommend this game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a fun game has a lot of missions so it keeps you entertained and is fun to play. I like how it makes you not have to do the tutorial and lets you get right to work and also how its not timed
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|What a very bizarre and really off the wall hilariously vulgar movie.  The bear is a riot and some of the situations as well as most of the dialogue in this unrated version had me in stitches laughing so hard.  Couldn't believe Walberg did this after coming so far in his movie career. I dont mean this to be bad, but just to be something totally unexpected.  Kinda like Cher giving a lecture on birth control and a proper social life.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game was horrible. I loved the first version but this one was terrible. especially on the kindle. it is so hard to turn. DONT GET IT!!
B00BESIKWM|5.0|I'm still trying to work out the main plot element, but I think as a horror movie in general, this does not suffer from any sequel jinx or just poor efforts.  This was done well and obviously had a good budget to pull off the FX.  You don't need to see the first to enjoy this - but it would help with understanding the characters and much of the storyline.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was awesome, highly recommend it if you like a good mystery thriller. It keeps your attention throughout the entire book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|He said - you'll like this as much as BSG, but it's so very cool and different.  I was skeptical, but after watching a marathon of the original mini-series...I am hooked and thinkn the writing and acting is excellent.  The &#34;Mayor&#34; character is starting to annoy me, but I'll wait to see where the writers/producers take the show this season.
B005LAII6C|5.0|It's quite a touching and very good simple film. Character designs were really well thought-out.<br /><br />The cover might look like a fun kids-type light scary film but in reality it's not. More for teens and adults stuff.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Tried to like this - just couldn't make it work.  Not even enough action for an action movie.  Perhaps others will find it more interesting than I did?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I don't typically read these type of books, however, this trilogy was great! Good story line, explicite but not crude, some mystery. A very good and easy read.

B00AB0AR2U|2.0|These movies after the second one are getting less and less interesting to watch and i've never played the video game, so I have nothing to compare it to other than the previous movies.<br /><br />I'm most interested in how they brought back Michelle Rodriguezin this movie since I couldnt get into anything else??  LOL
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I have watched every MIB movie.  This was a disappointment with the special effects.  Not as many aliens as in the others. Its not a complete disappointment... But I would just rent this and not make the mistake I did with a  purchase of the cd.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is a wonderful series that takes a more faithful approach to Holmes compared to the Elementary series.  The fun and wit of both main characters shine through.  I appreciate the modern retelling of the classic stories.

By the third book, I felt that the author did not know how she wanted to end the series, and some of this comes across in the roller coaster ride that is Katniss' confusion; as the reader you can empathize with the main characters and their decisions (you are by no means surprised at their actions at any point).<br />All in all, I felt satisfied once finished the saga and I really hope the movies stay as true as possibly to story line.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Even at 17, I had never held such a level of \\"helplessness\\" and indecisiveness. I felt that this was too exaggerated and drawn out.<br />-I could not tell who the author was writing for?! Was this pre teen fiction? This series touches all ages, but the language remained a little too innocent, especially when the narrator is leading a rebellion and is thrown into bloody arenas/battles.<br /><br />Likes:(to end on a good note)<br />+ Character interactions go beyond the superficial<br />+ Youth culture world wide can easily use the series to draw their own parallels about dysfunctional government and inequality.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|The product was shipped very quickly. It is a great blu ray with great quality and interesting. My fiancé enjoyed it!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I have enjoyed CM since season 1 and the show is still going strong!  Great cast, excellent story lines will continue to watch
B000FIMG68|5.0|A very good follow up to the first season. Season had one of the most shocking twists and moves on tv. A show that kept you guessing and wantuing more. A big betrayal happens to our main players. You learn more about Jack, Sawyer, Kate and the other surviors of the plane crash. More Flashbacks, Smoke monters and you meet some of the Others( people who are on the island that are taking them out) . This was a very good show. A must watch
B006VREHRS|5.0|I thought it was going to be boring, but it definitely was not. Check it out and see for yourself.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book took a little while to get in to but then I didn't want to put it down.  Written in somewhat of a dialect is the reason it was hard to get in to at first............it is a worthwhile time commitment...
0765325950|5.0|It was very fulfilling yet left me wanting more, if that makes sense.  It seems to have left the door open for another book down the line.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|BEST APP EVER I loved using 255 diamond picks to mine odsidian on my server loved it sooooo much worth it
0345803485|1.0|I borrowed that book from the library to see what all the hype is about. Is that supposed to be a Cinderella story?<br />I don't think anyone will forget words gasped, murmured, inner doggess, grinned and so on as they were used and overused.<br />Oh yeah and women who loved that book probably are dreaming about Christian Grey in their life. What they dream about is money and looks. Not about a contract that would tell them what to eat, what to wear, how long to sleep and how many times to exercise...and yeah enjoying whipping.<br />Oh yeah and how Christian goes six to midnight after just watching his woman bite her lip million times a day.....dream on women. It doesn't happen. Just as million big O's a day. You gotta be so bored in your bedroom to dive into a fantasy like this.<br />How can someone even call this book a bestseller.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is so helpful when figuring out difficult math problems!!!! We use it all the time for homework help! it is a great resource.
1451695195|5.0|This is a very powerful and moving account of a truly extraordinary experience of one whose credentials make it very persuasive.
B0032KPE0G|1.0|.....and there is no tech support that I could find and no response two days later from the email I sent.<br />Bought it for three times the price the same night on iTunes and it played perfectly, however, and I LOVE THE MOVIE
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a sizzling love story. It kept you wanting to keep reading to find out what happens next.<br />Really enjoyed it. Would not recommend to teens or someone that does not like explicit scenes.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I saw them perform Closer on Ellen and immediately fell in love with the song, so I bought the album. I am not disappointed that I did. The songs really get into your head. Now I have to look at getting some of their other albums.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book is truly amazing. Having never read it before and finding some time on my hands, I decided to read<br />some of the classics, starting with this one. I am glad I decided to add this book to my repertoire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun game. Plenty to do.to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do. There 20
1936608898|5.0|\\"It Starts With Food\\" is a great read.  So great I gave it to my family for the holidays and have it on my recommendation list for clients.  I am a paleo/primal \\"style\\" real food eater and wellness coach and this book resonated with me in more ways than I could say.  A wonderful, easy and entertaining read chock full of good brain food.  Thanks!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|One of the best games ever. I like how you can keep playing to unlock other games<br />  Its a great game.
B004PIKPTY|3.0|So I had this headset for probably about 3 months and it was amazing the sound quality was really good, the drivers were pretty legit, able to focus on multiple noises that go on in a game and magnify it.  Looks really good on just about anyone, it was even able to fit my roommates head which is massive.  Really comfortable, could wear it for hours<br /><br />The one downer to this guy, is that the cord eventually shorts out if you don't utilize the clip on it (at least that's what it fealt like).  A short happened in mine where the leds stopped working then eventually at the end of the third month the sound just stopped working on the speakers and the mic was going out.  I'm really annoyed that I didn't listen to the reviews and was hoping for the benefit of the doubt since it was such a costly headset.<br /><br />side note: not sure if I'm going to buy any thermaltake products from here on out, I originally did this as a test run to see if I would like Thermaltake products and it makes me kind of glad that I didn't go forth with getting anymore as I'm less likely to ever purchase from them, sorry.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|Frankly the game is fun but at the bottom of the screen there are many advertising ad's that come in every time you die and because of the button placement you hit the ad's almost every time you die.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season has continuously shocked me and kept me invested every episode. Much better than the second season! I recommend watching Walking Dead just so you can get to this season where they are pulling out all the punches.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This Book Is amazing I've Read 4 times and each time i fall even more in love the characters. Can not wait for Walking Disaster. I think what i love most about this book is the setting is near me so i can relate to the weather, everything really.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This season is very disappointing in comparison with the first two. It seems that the writers are filling episode space with pointless story lines and the season is really being bogged down by it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it is fun to pplay with my seven year old son. he helps me solve the puzzles and it.makes him use his brain power
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Argo was good, but for some reason I wasn't impressed to no end like it seems many are. It was at least very entertaining.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I felt that this book does a wonderful job of hooking you into their lives. I wanted to read the book before the movie, and I'm absolutely glad that I did. The ending has a twist that you would never see coming (unless you've seen the movie of course!) I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read a non-traditional love story!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I get a bit disturbed with this game at times. I see times that the screen should have cleared and didn't. It does add I guess to the spirit of the game. Still love it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A good Angry Birds game.  Just hard enough to be interesting but not so hard as to be frustrating to play.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|I haven't got into this game much yet. I will be back to add more after I have tried it out.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I don't see the point of this game.  It has nothing to do with Angry Birds and is boring to play.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This is a great chick flick that your man would enjoy also. So many big names in the movie and it keeps you engaged the entire movie.
B006UW4OB8|4.0|Very good and easy to use password program. Can use cross platforms,which is helpful. The only drawback is it does not sync with android and ios. Example: macbook pro and kindle fire hd 8.9.
B008COD5OO|5.0|This is a funny movie. Not a serious plot or something you need to think about. It is just a funny movie not complex by any means.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read The Martian in two days on my Iphone using the Kindle app, opening it whenever I could find two minutes of free time during the weekend, and finishing it at three in the morning on Monday. Believable from the beginning to the end. Witty and innovative, the author leads you through two years of hardship on a forsaken planet, alone. I still think about what it would have felt like when I am lying in bed at night.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest so by downloading this app it makes accessing pintrest so much easier. I am able to view and pin on the go...I just wish it would be easier to search people
B00005JNS0|5.0|What a cute movie. I bought it for my grand children along with Cars 2. If they make a Cars 3, I'll get that one too.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a fun game. I would tell anyone about this game.  The first time I have been looking for all.
B001HN6922|5.0|What a cute movie. My grand children love this one as much as the original. And if they make a Cars 3, I'll get that one too.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Great!!!! I really liked this book!! I cant wait for more!! Hard to put down!! My daughter loved it  too!!
B003L77GG0|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son. He has all the seasons and rewatches them from time to time.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|A facinating insight into the lives of the Navy Seals, their traning and dedication.Found it hard to put down as it kept my attetion all through the book.<br />Would definately recomend this book.
0486438600|5.0|This book has alot of beautiful traditional mehndi designs, some easy some more intricate so this book is good for all levels of henna artists. Im enjoying it lots!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Beautiful, simply beautiful. It's as if I actually own my very own horse. Get this app, one of the best.
1612680011|5.0|Really good. I suggest to any one to read.  Came in a nice box, came fast.  Very good for any one interested in getting ahead financially.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful, suspenseful love story.  I could hardly put this book down.  Nicholas Sparks is a magical storyteller.  i HAVE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED ALL OF HIS WORKS.
034580404X|5.0|Love these books! Not appropriate for anyone under 18 for sure! The author does a good job getting you so involved with the characters that you feel that you know them personally. Yes, the constant sex did start getting old by the time I got to the third book but the plot was very good so that's what kept me reading. The writing quality isn't the best and sometimes it seemed a little redundant or the same words being used over and over again, but it has a good story and great characters.
0307341569|5.0|Dark Places was a great read, with twists that will keep you guessing until the end.  Will definitely be checking out other novels by Gillian Flynn.
1451695195|3.0|I was initially very reluctant to read this book, as I thought it may be another biblically influenced Christian account of \\"heaven\\". I found it refreshing in a way that the author is a neurosurgeon and had this experience that effects the brain, and not being particularly religious but a sceptic of the metaphysical. The writing style is easy to read and there a some good explanations of how the brain/mind works.<br />The author does not reveal everything he saw in the other dimensions, but does point our a few things that the Bible also states, such as God is love, God is everywhere, we are loved, etc. I feel the author could have divulged more about the knowledge/understanding he claims he received, and how the spiritual dimension operates, as he was part of it. It has got me more interested in consciousness and metaphysics though. In conclusion, probably lacking in enough substance to make it a truly stand-out book, but I'll definitely read it again.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Roberty downey junior does it again, this movie is one the best genre fims i've seen in years, excellent acting throught, guy ritchie was on point directing, it was an overall great ride and is over way too soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome gots good stuff it's amazing a really really really really really really really really really really really really really really good book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game seems to call out to me.  I love the graphics, which have improved signficantly from the original Temple Run.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  It is very addicting to try and not only finish each level, but to do it perfectly.
B008J344BQ|3.0|This a great CD.  She's an awesome singer and songwriter...but this is supposed ot be the clean version and I can't listen to it with my kids as it's obvious what the word is that's been blanked out.  In the old days a clean version had different words not just the dirty words partially blanked...:(
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|I'm an animator. Not a child or parent.<br /><br />I was surprised that this was actually good. The commercials looked silly and were playing into the whole &#34;princess&#34; thing.<br /><br />While Sofia is a princess, it's just as much about her being a princess as it is being accepted into a new family. She doesn't have an evil step-dad, but a step-dad who wants to include her into his family and help her succeed. Her new step brother and sister think she is encroaching on the family, so they try to make fun of her. But she tries her best to become friends with her new family.<br /><br />From a production stand point, it's also good. Some of the animation and textures get wonky at times. Over all it's grade A animation for TV. They did a GREAT job making Cinderella in 3D. It's not odd to see her in 3D at all.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|There a few funny sketches in this book, but the rest seem to be strung out. I was hoping for more actually.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The writers do an awesome job of keeping you at the edge of your seat. Best by far that u have seen. I'm in for the whole series.
0374275637|5.0|There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to know where to start with a review and I think it really needs reading more than once to absorb all the information contained in it.  The book examines the way we think and divides that thinking initially into two systems – System 1 and System 2.  System 1 is what we use when we give an answer to a question ‘off the top of our heads’ or sum up a situation without really thinking about it.  System 2 is what we use when something needs more concentrated thinking and effort.<br /><br />But that is not the end of it.  System 1 is not always right and can be over-ridden by the greater effort made by System 2 bit we don’t always like to contradict our own first impressions.  The book covers all sorts of scenarios where our brains and judgement do not always serve us well and do not make the best decisions for our wellbeing.  Human beings are notoriously fallible when it comes to making choices especially when it comes to a choice between a gain and a loss.  Even experts don’t always make the right decision and may be unable or unwilling to admit they have got something wrong.<br /><br />The human brain can be fooled by more than just optical illusions and we are not ever keen on questioning our own judgements.  The book looks at how we assess risk and reveals we are unduly influences by irrelevancies and by our own biases.  We are very bad at assessing the probability of an unlikely event happening.  I finished reading this book feeling that I should question every single decision I make!  But it is not all doom and gloom and if you are aware of the ways in which your brain may fool or confuse you then it may be possible to eliminate at least some of the errors human beings are prone to make.<br /><br />There are copious notes on all the chapters, which contain details of further reading for those interested in following up any of the aspects of thinking which are covered in the book.  There is also an index.  If you want a comprehensive book about thinking then try this one but be prepared to put in some hard work to get the best out of it.o an index.  If you want a comprehensive book about thinking then try this one but be prepared to put in some hard work to get the best out of it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|but I will admit to liking it.  At first, I thought this was just a dirty book.  But as I kept reading, I saw it more as an exploration of the psyche of a deeply flawed man and how he could be helped by the love of a good woman.  I'd give it five stars if it was shorter an a little less graphic, but can't give it less than four because of how much I came to care about the characters.
