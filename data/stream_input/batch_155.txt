B001UPP5GS|5|It looks like a good product but I had to return it as it wouldn't work with the electric fan that I bought.
B00DYSDHFA|5|Really excellent quality blades. They fit in perfectly with my Camry's style and they work great.
B000C2SUWQ|5|Fit and worked, no problems.  Only time will tell if it holds up.
B00P2D3W00|2|I bought this bulb for the dome lamp in my 03 Nissan Frontier cab. Not very bright. Might be better if my dome lamp was closer to windshield  (like a map light)
B00C7Z4TY4|3|Needed a larger one,
B005PJJ89U|5|This Digital Tire Gauge is compact, easy to read, has a range that will suit my car, truck, and riding mower (11 psi through 60 psi), and it comes in a very nice zippered case.  The business end has sufficient depth to it so that it guides itself onto the valve stem and makes a good seal with the valve every time -- no lost air while taking a reading.  My judgement of accuracy is based on a comparison of readings along side my dial gauge, although my dial gauge doesn't go to the high end of the range that the digital gauge has.  I'm going to have to assume that the higher end of the digital scale is as accurate as the lower end and leave it at that.  The programmable feature of the gauge doesn't add any value for me since only one vehicle can be programmed into it, but that feature doesn't get in the way either.
B00CFXW1AM|5|Worked very well for me. The projectors fit well into my headlight housing and cast a very distinct beam pattern. These really improved the efficiency of my HID upgrade bulbs.
B003DNL8YI|1|Poor quality. Was not at all water resistant as advertised (we purchased it to cover a car roof that leaks). Returned the item.
B007S1M28M|5|Great cam for the price. I'm still running a little lean on bigger jets, so you will likely need a bigger jet if you're currently running stock. Not hard to start, great mid range power
B00B0T69PK|1|Dident fit no matter how you try to mount it wouldent re omend to any one and the stiching sucked right out the box
B000BQPIGY|5|THE BEST CLEANER EVER!!! I've tried them all and this product wins hands down
B000AS1Y4I|5|Worked perfectly on my '99 V-star 650. Included some O-rings, but none were the ones I actually needed for the cover that fits over the filter... But that was no matter, since I've never changed it with the previous dozen filters. The cost was less than half of what a Yamaha Dealer charges. Now get yourself some Rotella 15w-40 and get to changing oil!
B005DOQYOO|5|The price is right good product
B0050Z9NDU|5|Great lights believe all the Hype,Made my Tahoe look great
B00B3YKUDY|5|Great luggage can't say enough about it, Viking did it right. Versatile.
B001KQC8HQ|5|I was unable to remove the factory links during a riser spacer installation without damaging them. The factor nuts/bolts were far to corroded and heat removal tricks would have damaged the ball and cup. These links were easily equivalent to the OEM links.
B0015Y7WCO|4|Heads up to amazon.com they have a amazing site to shop from. And as always shipping is always fast and on time. THANK YOU FOR THAT! Anyway back to the air conditioner cover it was worth the amount i payed for it which was very little so cant complain. I gave it a 4 star because of the color other then that the cover was made out of heavy vinyl and did the job.
B0009VD192|5|I have a Toyota Highlander 2002.  This fits perfect, and looks great!
B002SUQRVQ|5|Beautiful beautiful and beautiful the item looks as if it was painted on my wall.beautiful item .take a look they have so many to choose from
B000BZEH3A|5|These sensor worked great on my c5 corvette and I've had them on for 2 years now still going strong
B00KWMT250|5|Very nice car mats.  Easy to clean up after a very wet and snowy winter.
B006K8GKBO|5|Already used it to straighten our AC fins and cleaned,,,,awesome
B001O06KF4|4|Good
B004K25GMG|5|Great flow, really impressive. Got my 33 tire up to running pressure in 1 min each. The only thing was that mine was that hose leaks air
B000E5U3ZI|5|Went in no problems to my '08 Jetta.  Didn't really notice anything performance-wise but I always get a K&N for my vehicles simply for the lifetime use.  Well worth the money to just have to clean it and oil it every so often.  One thing I will point out is that after some research on some VW forums it sounds like you have to be careful when you do oil these or you could cause problems with your MAF sensor.  Not a big deal if you do it right.  Oil goes on the side the air is flowing from...don't put it on the other side and you're safe.
B000EDOTCS|5|Purchased for our RV.  It's great.  Love that we can unhook and take it outside when needed.  Love that our paper towels finally have a home.
B005VUPJ0U|5|Looks better made than the original.
B00AZSPOD0|5|Awesome keychain!
B007FDOY20|5|Works beautifully to hold other travel bags on your passenger seat or to bungee down other items that you may need to carry on the back of your motorcycle.  Protects your rear fender from damage.
B0074EJ6IC|5|I liked to have a little bling on my things and this really brought a little bling to my steering wheel, I love it.  It's not to much, and women ask where I got it all the time even when I am at stop lights.
B00BW4MDHQ|5|Works great! Definitively looks better than my old peeling one.
B009H6L44Y|5|We run our Rzr's and Rhinos in the trails in North Idaho. This light for the price is a great deal. I have no desire to pay 500+ for a light and this fit the bill perfectly. I don't do 100 mph or run the Baja so for the back woods its a perfect fit. Plenty bright for nigh time trail riding.
B00JBIR7DK|5|These where so easy to install from my factory lights, took me 5 minutes and they look beautiful!!! Now i wish they had it for headlights or i need to find the ones for head lights
B00DLMPM5W|2|I bought these for all of our vehicles and love them. I have had mine for maybe a month now and have had nothing but problems with them going out. I am now going to have to order another set to replace these.
B009FNWP38|4|this is not a custom nerf bar.  it is the same company that makes westin nerf bars and running boards.  i purchased this item to replace the westin nerf bars on my ford explorer that had rusted from the inside out.  they had been on the truck for 3 years and were out of warranty.  lets see if this set lasts any longer.  since they offer a 5 year warranty and are sold through amazon, i'm thinking that any rust through warranty will be honored.  the price is the real selling point.  the exact same westin nerf bars run $100 more.  installation took one hour, including removing the old nerf bars.  i would have just replaced the bars themselves, since the mounting hardware and the bars themselves were identical, but the allen bolts were seized.  a couple of star washers were missing and one of the allen bolts that hold the bar onto the brackets was the wrong size.
B00N191Q7I|5|Looks good
B000EO771W|3|For the money this is a fair deal. The weakness of the product is the limited number of stations that this unit is capable of utilizing. Other than that it serves it purpose. I use it to download mp3 audio programs and then play them while driving. Not the best audio quality but this was not purchased for music. I would buy another one if the need should arise. It is a very reliable product and uses a USB Flashdrive for storage making it very simple to use. But you should know that you cannot fast-forward what you are listening to, you can only go the next audio file.
B007JXEJ1C|1|It is the wrong part. I don't know how to return it.. If that is even possible. I am bummed.
B003TSUL2M|3|one strap was the wrong size, the one that fit replaced the worst one. so it worked out
B0009NUG66|5|Item performed as required and recommended. Good to have for extra travel storage space. Well worth the investment..
B000FP8HFK|5|I love this tape. Use it for Waxing vehicles, labeling baggies for motor tear downs, very versatile product. Would recommend to a friend.
B00F0MBI9A|4|Very nice good I like  I love my step bar's  muy buenas y faciles de instalar no te toma mucho tiempo
B004M9L1Z8|5|Great product, as described and came faster than expected
B000EDUUIA|5|My GF would park so close to the wall where I couldn't get access to my cabinets. She also would park so far back that the garage scrapped her trunk on her SUV. These little things are a heaven sent! Very easy to install and very durable. GF drives a 2014 Nissan Rogue and they have been stuck to the floor since I installed them. No more garage accidents and no more parking to close to the wall! These are great! I'm going to buy another pair when we move.
B00802F2US|5|Nice
B0002SA4C4|5|my FJ40 look awsome with it new half doors, very good for protection against the elements, now I need my bikini top.
B0002KR88A|5|A perfect solution to an in line fuse requirement
B00C5AK13Y|5|The new cat fit perfectly and got rid of my P0430 code. I already had the Flowmaster American Thunder cat-back dual exhaust installed on my 2007 King Ranch F-150. I feel like the new drivers side cat is a little louder, even though that's not what I was going for. The hardest part was getting the old one off, rusted nuts and the like. When the old cat came out, chunks fell out of it so it was definitely toast. Makes me wonder what kind of shape the passenger side cat is in :/ Ford warranties cats for 8 years/80,000 miles. I only have about 55,000mi but my 8 years was up last September.
B00K6498D0|2|did not work on my 2007 audi
B008UX68OQ|5|Fits perfectly to my bike.  Even tho it is kept in the garage, this keeps dust and my cats off of the seat and controls.  A wonderful idea and good bargain.
B003EOTZLO|5|This is exactly what I wanted. Only thing, pic is of black door and a spice color came. But I don't mind. It still looks very good :)
B001A1FBIO|5|Although I would have preferred it to be easier to install (only need one person), once installed, it looks and works like the original.
B0054LT4R0|5|good quality part metal with an actual white background and black logo rather than pictured item fast delivery came with set screws and allen wrench
B00029K022|5|Worked just perfect.  I installed a product called Timbren and it did not work.  These helper springs are just right installed in the lowest weight.
B00MJUSLWI|5|Stink better watch out.
B002ARTH8C|2|This product is okay if you do not expect too much. It is stamped out from a die and the edges are extremely sharp. They did not even bother to deburr. Sharp edges will damage the paint on your license plate mount. Also they are sharp enough to severely cut yourself. It is funny because they put a note disclaimer inside the packaging that the edges are sharp. Also the frame is made of a  very thin gauge material. It is very flimsy. If they would have the demurred it I would say it was worth the price that I paid for it.
B000EQCV8E|5|Rides like a new one again
B00BJJZRBI|1|The product came properly but unfortunately I have not bought correctly because the specifications were different. My foul.
B004C46IW4|4|It was the perfect gift for my mom. She loves her some tweety bird. Thank you so very much. Tweet
B003G0KCCM|5|They fit so well protects Floor so well .
B003AL23TC|4|Too early to rate 5 star but working as described. Bigger than I thought it would be. Like what appears to be the pad locking attachment for security.
B003ZYY85G|5|Great product!...and Amazon delivered the product to my front door in a timely matter too!
B001R4JHRA|5|Excellent product to get if you want to properly secure something in the back of your pickup truck. Only one is needed.
B00KTIXGLI|5|It's the best
B000BZGMF6|3|Car died on Wed. Battery was brand new a couple years old, so knew that i needed a new alternator. Problems with car holding charge at red lights, headlights dimming. Ordered and arrived two days later. Just finished up installing at home. Only problem i have is that this isnt listed as remanufactured on amazon, but NEW!!!! But what i received says REMANUFACTURED on the bosch box.  I thought i purchased a new alternator?? Cant believe advertised as NEW but received as a REMAN alternator.
B00D568AN0|1|The part was in good shape but it didn't fit at the screw of the antenna was too small.  What can I do to get this part back to the person I purchased it from and get the correct part?
B0015PN010|4|Excelente
B001CJHU9W|5|Solid guage.  Easily connected to tire valve.  Little difficult getting precise to the pound when checking around 30 lbs since it's in a narrow range of the guage.  But that's the way it goes with a dial guage.
B003TOEIVG|5|Fits very well as exactly as expected.
B00404WDUC|5|I've used many different types of pressure gauges and I always used to have to fiddle around with the head to get a good seal on the valve. I would always loose a bunch of air before I got a good seal for a reading. And then all those gauges were awful for accuracy as well.<br /><br />I use a air compressor in my garage to top up the air pressure as required and the gauge on the gun is about 5 PSI above actual pressure and I never knew that until I got this pressure gauge. This gauge is accurate, easy to use and very handy. Would highly recommend!
B00194C8H4|3|Pants fit good. Both front pocket linings tore easily after only wearing once. Thank goodness I didn't lose my money or wallet. They fell out my pant legs when I got off the bike.
B001ETUWN6|5|worked great to ski in for my son in the snow in CO.  FYI, I would suggest cutting out more or bigger holes in the mouth area for breathing. Otherwise you will fog your goggles.<br /><br />I did this for all our facemasks and it worked great. Breathe out the mouth area and no more foggy/iced goggles!
B000C9UKCM|5|fit perfect
B004HEBN1A|2|Got the job done.  Alright for the price.  This item showed up with (3) dime sized sections of paint flaked off.  I highly recommend buying some curved washers to go on top and on bottom of the 1&#34; tubing, I wouldn't trust this thing with out that little add-on.
B0017K69MA|5|This item works great!!!  Gets my hard to reach windshield clean fast.  I have a 2008 Honda Civic and it has a very long windshield but this tool reaches every inch of it.  I bought the Invisible Glass Reach Cleaning liquid at my local Walmart (this is what the directions recommend using with this tool) and it works great as well.
B007R7YMRQ|5|It's just as described (meaning: awesome) it's really soft and has a clip on it that's pretty strong. It came the very first day it said it would. I love it!
B0002JN56A|5|Still working just fine.
B005FKRKVC|5|I bought these for my 2k mustang and they work perfect!! Exactly the same ones they sell at American Muscle but a little cheaper. I would buy them again for my next mustang!!
B000W0RQ8C|5|Great!
B006IU5CUY|5|This stays nice and clear. No chipping, no fading, rain, wind, any weather, big and clear enough to see from behind and read at a good distance.
B000C91FDA|4|Needed some adjustments for the mounting bracket but fit very well and works great
B0053SY1KE|5|This product is great for those cold night/early morning rides.  I will open up the nose holes just a bit so my glasses wont fog so easily.  It keeps my face and neck nice and comfortable.
B0034ZUZM6|4|I purchased the Superwinch LT3000 for a Polaris Sportsman 550 XP, I also purchased the Superwinch mounting bracket. 1st a tip for XP owners. The installation for the Polaris XP will be upside down from all the pictures in the directions, but Superwinch does say in the written instructions to mount it upside down.  You want the positive and negative power terminals on the left side of the ATV (or your right if you're facing the front of the ATV). If you don't do this one of the terminals will rub your radiator hose. Trust me you'll know if you make the mistake, and you'll have to wrestle it out of the mounting bracket to flip it around.<br /><br />About The Winch:  The price is fantastic, but I also have a Terra 3500 and you can see quality differences. I see the differences with the wired remote switch, the handlebar switch, and solenoid. I’m sure they’ll hold up fine, but they’re of less quality. I tested the LT3000 the other day in the woods, in deep snow, on a steep hill. The line comes off the spool very smoothly when pulling by hand, and the winch pulls fast. It didn't seem inferior to the 3500 in any way. Time will tell, but the LT3000 looks nice and seems like a quality unit.
B000B8JUM0|5|needed two for my truck price was so reasonable that I just replaced them when they came, maintenance says repair bills
B0013REXO8|1|Virtually every aspect of the Jeep Wrangler can be customized in some way.  Sometimes with customizations, your desire for the new stuff exceeds your willingness and ability to install said equipment.  The Rugged Ridge Tail Light Guards came with all the right instructions and material to install quickly and easily.  It probably took me longer to locate a screwdriver than it took me to do the installation.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found all of the right screws were included and ready to go.<br /><br />Although there are many different tail light guards available for the Wrangler, I happen to think that the Rugged Ridge are among the most handsome.  And because they are easy to install, you get almost instant gratification.  If you own a 2007-2013 Wrangler, you owe it to yourself to order up set of these tail light guards.  Enjoy!!<br /><br />---Update to the original review - After just over a year, I'm noticing that one taillight guard is actually rusting and the other one has really rusty screws....very disappointing to see that happen after being in place for 14 months.  I've ammended my review and lowered it to 1 star - there's no reason these units should be rusty after just 14 months on my Wrangler.  Do yourself a favor and skip spending the $$ on these....
B0007VCL2W|5|The 2006 Ford Ranger extended cab trailer hitch arrived as scheduled and in very good condition. No paint scratches. Included easy to follow instructions and all the necesary bolts and shims to install it without the need to drill the truck's frame.
B002CEP0XY|4|Purchased two of these at the same time. One went on a John Deere gator winch and the other went on a winch on my flatbed trailer. I will buy a third for the winch on my pickup.<br />  Installation was easy. The instructions are a bit vague and only for their winch product and my Champion Winches were not listed. However, there are only four wires and it isn't difficult to figure out the connections.  Red is 12 v power. Connect it to one of the relays power source in your winch.  Black is ground.  Yellow and white are the wires that carry the signal for In or  Out.  From the Control plug connection on the inside of your winch there are four factory wires.  Power, Ground, IN , Out.  Connect the yellow to one of the wires you think is IN or Out. Connect the white wire to the other wire you think is IN or Out.  With power and ground connected, test the winch with the remotes in the package. Be careful, there is a lag time for the winch. Hold the button/s down only momentarily to get a feel for the lag.  If the controls IN and Out are backwards, swap the yellow for the white and the IN/Out will reverse on the control button/s.<br />  One control sent to me had a dead battery. Check your batteries in the Controls before troubleshooting any issues. I ordered two at the same time. Each had its own frequency. They do not interfere with each other  when both winches are in close proximity.
B0009H51O4|5|Right price and easy to install. I will never go to a mechanic to change the air filter again.
B0049Z43J6|5|very good!
B0011G3S6A|5|Very Easy to Install, Great Fit, Looks Good. Used this deflector to replace the broken factory piece that would require major work.
B0041CADO6|5|great product.
B004HCOE72|5|This was easy and does a great job
B0057OC9B2|1|Tried this product out and when I began I realized that the first step, the polisher was gritty, like wet sanding your headlamp. I continued and use the finisher and it looked not too bad but nothing like the commercial. After a week or two the shine disappeared and The headlamp was as foggy as before. A very weak product at best.Just order a new lens before you try this product.
B0067UE58U|5|Best blades that I have ever purchased.
B004ZF4RAK|5|I was very impressed.  It was like night and day, literally.
B006RKYM2E|1|to big had to bend it with a vise drill out all fore holes  plus it has a bad Crome job on it.  not very happy with this rack
B003LNSDQ6|1|Wrong size tube. This was not what I ordered. Tube was replaced a second time with another tube which was also incorrect.
B0093AA5KI|5|Fits great and affordable.
B000OUW7KC|5|Never used these before.  Took a while to figure out what was supposed to happen.  Finally they locked in place solidly and the radio pulled out.  It's a trick getting them to release from the radio with the radio out of the car.  The new radio uses different unlocking keys, so these now live in my toolbox for later use someday.
B000C7S116|5|THE SAVINGS ON AMAZON BASICALLY PAID FOR MY MECHANIC TO INSTALL.. GO FIGURE.
B00DDZD4OI|4|UPDATE (31 December 2015): I am pleased to see that the current product listing clearly states that the chromed material is plastic (&#34;Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) core triple plated in real chrome&#34;). This was not the case when I initially reviewed this item. As such, my review bumps up 1 star from 3 stars to 4. Still wish it was $10 cheaper (total cost); I hope the higher price is not because the manufacturer has to pay a steep licensing fee to WWP...?  [Original Review] On the plus side: - Unique, really good looking car emblems. - Excellent customer service from AutoVisionz.  On the minus side: - The emblems may be triple chromed, but they are still plastic. As such, I really have a hard time seeing $24.99 as a reasonable price point. In contrast, I bought this item ([[ASIN:B006YTMCFW United States Army Star Chrome Metal Auto Emblem, Official Licensed]]) and found it to be a better value: it's about half the size of the AutoVisioniz emblem and while it's is not quite half the price, it is completely metal. No plastic. Had these AutoVisionz emblems sold for under $15.00 (say, $12.99) I think you would get a better value for your money.  So I'm conflicted. I love the emblems: they're unique and really good looking. I love the fact that AutoVisionz makes a donation to the Wounded Warrior Project with each sale. And I had a great experience with the AutoVisionz customer service department. In the end, I really wanted to keep these emblems and write a 5-star review, but being plastic I found them less than what I thought I was buying and more than my wallet could afford. Hence my 3-star review.  (One final comment. While AutoVisionz did do some editing to make the listing less misleading, I wish they had gone one step further and fixed the item title. Maybe I'm the dense one here, but &#34;Wounded Warrior Edition Chrome Car Emblem&#34; still gives - to me - the impression the emblem is chrome on metal. Drop &#34;chrome&#34; from the title and I think all would be good.)
B00407V3RI|5|A prefect color match and easier to use than falling down the stairs! This is a great product and one that I won't hesitate to use again, if necessary.
B0013HYAZA|5|bright and clear with a hint a blue love them  I continue to buy them
B005OKVGG8|1|These did not fit in my Toyota Sienna third row seat, I thought they were universal.
B00IKPJ7MO|5|to expensive
B00JH24TXQ|1|Batteries came all three were leaking
B000P0HJ7W|5|This shower arm was very hard to find locally. When I went on Amazon, I found exactly what I needed. The product was well packaged and delivered on time. Price was great and we now have a working shower. Thank you. I am sure I will use this seller again.
B000MK2C7W|5|Had k and n kit before this.. that kit fell off every 3 days this ones been bolted in secure for weeks now no problems. Very good fit and just looks pretty damn good under the hood to.
B0045VJP0G|5|Gave them to my daughter.
B00BFE59LA|5|Works great in our 2008 Nissan Xterra
B009Y7MJVS|5|Suction is strong, no interference with the transponder, and it fits both the old and new EZPASS transponder shapes. Works well.
B00651CLCS|5|Great antenna I have had it on my 2013 JK for a few months and aside from occasionally losing signal to my xm it is great and works great makes my jeep look so much better
B001GN0COE|5|It does the trick but on the picture its big but when you get it its small the turnamals are really small just a heads up
B00F68HINI|5|The splash guards are OEM so quality wise they are impeccable. To make the installation easier you would need a mini dual drive ratchet. Also the push pins for the front are kind of difficult to remove. I had to replace them with ones I bought from Autozone. This is a easy DIY with the right tools.
B003C1LV7K|5|It works better than I expected it to. I may even order another one. It is well made and the price is right.
B002MF0KT2|3|Lights fits perfectly in car. Light bulbs kept blowing fuse. Seller wouldn't send new bulbs.
B000MNN4WQ|4|Overall good, just wish the hooks were a little more curved to the close position for my application of motorcycle tie downs.
B00HSQDFR4|3|Not really a good sticker for a car window. I end up putting it on my laptop
B00480N154|4|The bulbs on my 2004 accord started to dim after 8 years of use.  After looking at various options to increase the light output and visibility during nightime driving, I decided to give these a try.  I had also considered putting in an HID upgrade kit, which have dropped in price significantly recently, but decided not to because of the existing headlight housing would not project the light properly and could potentially blind oncoming drivers.<br /><br />After installing these bulbs, there was a very noticeable difference in the light output.  Roadside signs were now being illuminated from a much further distance.  I would estimate that the light now extends about 30 to 40 percent further than my previous stock bulbs, but these bulbs are still halogens so don't expect them to perform like HID lights. The color of the light is also a little whiter than the previous ones, but it still is a little yellow.  Again, don't expect HID type color.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with these bulbs.  They seem brighter and throw a beam further down the road than my stock bulbs.  I am aware that these brighter bulbs typically have a shorter life span.  If I can get a few years out of these, I will be happy.  Only time will tell.  Will post an update later on.
B005Y3J05E|3|Ummmmmm
B00KVQJYKA|4|Once we got it on it works and look
B000X22224|5|Matched existing Floor liners, great product!
B0016GRTVU|5|Great value for the money!
B00POME6ZE|4|A little bit of a hassle to use on the minivan. The flaps are sometimes a challenge to get just so. The wind wants to blow the flap out. So I've figured out if I open my sliding door in the back, I can reach through, grasp the flap and then shut the front door on it.<br /><br />It performed excellent on a day there was freezing rain and snow. If you don't brush off the snow from the side flap, the snow will fall into your car. The magnets do keep it from blowing off in the wind.<br /><br />It's also somewhat of a challenge to determine top from bottom. It is plenty large enough for a minivan though.<br /><br />I will be using this again next winter.
B003OJMA3E|5|Transaction was fast and easy. The shippment even arrived earlier than expected. Glasses are pretty sturdy too.   I would definatly purchase again.
B0009H51ZS|5|Great price for a perfect match filter. I have not had any issues with this filter and I will update if I do...
B005J8S7BW|5|My '62 comet has never looked cooler,  Shaved door kit is very solid and has great instructions with pictures.<br />A home project for anyone with a cut off wheel and welder. ( no high price shop required).<br />Price was super low and affordable.
B000CKR4ZW|5|Original heater core developed a leak and we ordered this replacement. This item fits perfectly and comes with new O rings. Fairly easy to fit. 5 months later the part is working very well and we're very happy. I recommend this and other Spectra products.
B00B009YMY|4|Fit was good and the price was excellent!  No issues after 10,000 miles
B00AEWA0UE|5|It's a gear! Goes around and drives sensor. Matches factory quality.<br /><br />Only issue was transit time for US shipper. Still came within stated time.  Wouldn't hesitate to order from them.
B000KMB2BO|5|Prima Hydro Wax is easy to use, doesn't streak and leaves the car shining like new. I was very surprised about how easy it is to use. I get the car washed and while it is still slightly wet I spray the entire car, then simply wipe it off. It doesn't haze and doesn't streak. Lasts almost a week. Really great for a quick detail to give that extra shine.
B0006Q5MLK|5|I kept getting tickets in the mail for going through EZ pass tool booth out here in New York city. My sticker was valid and I had money in my account. They had no reason to keep sending me violation tickets in the mail. Each time I wrote them a letter explaining the circumstances and asked that they void the tickets. They told the system had problems and they would fix it. Well I put a stop to it when I ordered 2 reflectors for my cars. I have not had any tickets in the mail since. I love this product. It is so simple and yet effective. Everyone should get it. The best $50 I have spent lately.
B004TR8F5C|4|Great hitch but the first time I used it in the rain it seemed like the grease washed off and I had galling of the moving parts and excessive noise while turning.  I had to loosen the bolts holding the spring bar sockets and clean the mating surfaces as best I could and re-lubricate.  I used motorcycle chain lube because it starts out thin to gets between the working surfaces and then thickens to a high pressure water resistant grease after the solvent flashes off.  Somewhat disappointed that I would have to perform such maintenance thus 4 stars.  Seller deserves 5 stars; hitch arrived on time in good condition.
B004D92S9K|5|Arrived on time and perfect!  Nothing else to say...
B00CENJ980|5|Great product
B00C8YXH9C|5|I received these the other day for my emergency roadside kit.... and have to say that these are pretty amazing. They are multifunctional and have nice extra features like the hook and magnet. Allot of planning and design went into making these.... at a decent price. I'm impressed.
B001DRHMMS|5|Mann ist der beste!
B00AYAIC60|1|*update:  After 3 months of using these blades in the Midwest, I have found these blades are of poor quality. They streak horribly even when clearing rain. Yes, I have cleaned my windshield. The issue lies with the wipers. I should have stuck with OEM replacements.      There is no \\"lock in\\" mechanism for these wiper blades. Sometimes, the wipers slide down off the J-hook of the wiper arm, though I usually notice the movement and push the wiper back up on the arm before it falls off.    *Bought for: 2010 Accord EX-L Sedan:
B002ZTGN2S|5|Bought for our 2010 Prius.  Don't have to worry about dirt or spills anymore.  Easy to take out & hose down or scrub with brush.  Fits the space perfectly.  Quite satisfied with this product.
B00877SL2M|4|Excellent product, I recommend
B00411QIAU|1|Very disappointed because a standard license did not fit even when brought to car dealer for assistance. Too small. Was really looking forward to this based on other reviews.
B003CKMO0O|5|Great!
B00BCH4WWC|5|Great spray bottles from a great company. Unlike some others these do not leak from the neck or sprayer tip when they are tight. It is also easy to mark on the bottles what you put in them.
B0046IC24O|1|It did not work for my 2003 and 2004 lincoln navigator. Its a hit or miss kind of product buy it at your own risk.
B000CF1WF0|5|Great fit nice stuff
B002YKMD3G|5|very well made tool - you may find other uses for it (other than auto headlamp aiming)
B000VB8H3K|5|The best mats you can get!! Pricey but excellent!
B00AQ29FOY|5|I got this hubcaps for my 03 VW new beetle because one of my stock hubcap was cracked.<br />I was somewhat skeptical because of the price. Arrived on time and installed them right away.<br />Only one of them were wrapped but there were no defect on the others.<br />Metal rings that holds the hubcap tight are separated on arrival so you have to put them in before putting them on your rims.<br />You have to be careful when you install them because forcing them into the rim may cause some damage.<br />It's been a week and they make my bug looks nice.<br />Definitely worth it.
B008CV91MM|5|Did the job great and the bushings are operating perfectly. Very solid tool, I'm sure it will last for years to come.
B005N53C9I|5|Perfect fit on 2005 Dodge Dakota
B00496GUC8|5|When I realized the price of these wiper were half that of AutoZone, I went ahead and made the purchase. It took a few minutes to clip them on, and they work perfectly.
B005992QKO|5|good addition to my truck
B001GMZBP0|5|Exactly what I ordered and expected. I have many Curt brand items including 3 hitches and many accessories. Never had any problems.
B00LZVEQL2|5|Great product!! Increase in fuel mileage.
B003E01ST0|5|Great service, item arrived as expected
B009VHOLTY|4|This tarp is heavier than the typical bargain store tarp.  It could use an eyelet or two more down each side but it worked perfectly for my application and should last much longer than the cheaper tarps.
B000AMXSUW|5|I needed the 9006XS size bulbs to fit my car.  I am glad to have found these.  As the name would imply, the light is a cool color.  These are quite easy to install.  I can't speak to the durability yet but I assume they will work as most other manufacturers.
B00D1CQUEY|5|I built a custom reverse trike and used a 94 S-10 conversion headlight with an HID bulb. The bulb didn't focus correctly in headlight housing. The H4 bulb shown brighter. But it was still dim lighting with just one light. I added this LED after hitting a deer in the ribs. And man, what a difference this light makes. I believe it is brighter than the HID. You can't tell the s-10 light is on with the LED on too. I am going to buy another one to replace the s-10 headlight.<br /><br />Now I have two, and they are like HID lights, super bright. I love them!
B000E2CR00|4|good!
B00CJ7HTNI|1|We can't get these to stay in either of our cars.  This creates a lot of screaming from the backseat and therefore not at all worth it.
B003S89B1A|5|An exellent buy if you need an additional key. The  only downside is that you must already have two working keys inorder to program a third key. The instructions for programing were clear and easy to follow.<br />I would highly reommend this product
B005KOZ25Y|5|Great tool. Read and cleared my Mercedes ML350 with no problems.  My other scanners won't even connect to the Mercedes.
B000182FAE|5|Very nice bars fit great on my '05 Jeep TJ. Took about a half hout to install. one backing mount bar needed to be grinded as it was too long due to a chassis weld that interferred with seating it, other than that this was a straight forward easy bolt-on mod (12 bolts). Bars appear very sturdy and note these are frame mount as compared to some others that will mount differently giving you less than a solid mount. Look good, sturdy, well packaged, easy install. Very satisfied wih this purchase.
B001W6LGGS|4|It was hard for me, impossible for some, and \\"easy\\" for others.  I will list the steps I took and you can decide it it is \\"easy\\", if you want to try it, and get some idea how you might install it. I was putting this on a 1993 Ford Escort station wagon.  Most of the extra parts and tools I ordered came from Amazon. You can read my other reviews to see the details.<br />1.  Mount the camera using the license plate screws in accordance with the directions.<br />2.  The camera blocks access to the liftgate latch.  Remove it and mount it upside down.  Now I can use the latch but the top of the license plate numbers are obscured.  Maybe the police won't mind.<br />3.  Remove the center brake light, inner liftgate \\"welt\\" and trim panel.  Pull loose the plastic moisture shield.<br />4.  Drill a 7/16\\" hole next to the license plate lights to fit the connector through.<br />5.  Order a grommet assortment so the wire won't get cut.<br />6.  Drill a 7/16\\" hole in the top of the trim panel near the tailgate lock button.<br />7.  Route the wire from the bottom hole out through the hole in the top of the liftgate.<br />8.  Reinstall the water shield, trim panel, and brake light.<br />9.  Order push pin remover pliers from Amazon (Do this before you start the job-this is actually the first step but I don't want to renumber everything).<br />10.  Remove the lower sill panel.  Order a push pin assortment to replace the ones that shattered on removal.<br />11.  Remove the passenger side rear bottom side panel.<br />12.  Cut a slit and hole in the top side trip panel and run the wire through it, then down the rear of the car to the taillight wires.<br />13.  Solder the wire from the transmitter to the backup light wire.  There are some easy connect fittings to make the connection easy but I couldn't get clearance to align the wires.  If you  don't have solder and a soldering iron, you need to buy these.  I soldered to the red/yellow wire.<br />14.  Tie strap the transmitter to sheet metal near the rear washer reservoir.  Connect the wire from the camera to the transmitter.<br />15.  Plug the display wire into a power point.  If you have more than one thing to plug in, buy an adapter.  I have an adapter that allows me to plug in the display, my GPS, and my radar detector.  I mounted the display in the center instrument cluster.  All it blocks is most of the speedometer.  I can still see 30-70 which is all I need.<br />16.  Turn the key on and shift into reverse to test.  The backup lights came on but the transmitter didn't transmit.  It is time to leave for work.  I will work on it more when I get back.<br />17.  Start the car.  The display comes on and the camera is working, in reverse, in all forward gears, in neutral.  I didn't think any of those wires had power when I was moving forward but at least the camera is working, except that the image is upside down because the camera is upside down.<br />18.  Back from work, I drilled two holes in the little plastic piece above the latch and mounted the camera there (right side up) using the supplied screws.  Now the latch and license plate nuumbers are both unobstructed.<br />19.  Re install the trim panels.<br /><br />You can decide for yourself if that is \\"easy\\" or not.  The camera is on all the time, which might shorten its life but it might still outlive the 19 year old car.  It sometimes flickers and gives a blue screen but is on most of the time and has a good, clear picture.  It is -1 F.  outside right now so there hasn't been much rain.  When the rainy season starts I will find out if there are any moisture problems.  The distance from the transmitter to the camera is short in my car.  With a bigger car or truck it will be longer.
B0009YDQBM|5|Mats are of a high quality material. Mine didn't small bad like other users stated in their reviews. I really like them and will recommened them to everyone.
B000BZG8ZA|4|The part works, just not for my car despite what Amazon.com said. I needed the Bosch 15718. So I wasted money on the part, time on replacing it, and $50 for a failed smog check.
B00AU8XED2|5|Nice look to column. Needs to be cut to size once yopu rteceive it.
B00GX4Y9AY|5|Works great would definitely recommend it to everyone
B005Z87H0I|5|Could not wait to put in the corner of my back window of my Jeep.  I love it, Love it, Love it.. Would recommend to my friends. thanks again..  T
B00S75A5IW|5|Received the item quickly. These led bulbs are awesome and worth the money. They are very bright and shows white.
B0006IX7WY|4|What a fantastic idea .... No more catching stuff when I open the RV fridge door
B00OPMIR2M|5|Great little tool, can't believe I lived with a cheap one where the little stick shot out the bottom and I took a wild guess. This thing is accurate, comfy in the hand, easy to read, accurate, and the bright yellow color makes it easy to spot. A super cool gift for yourself or a friend, male or female
B00BZUMLK6|5|Excellent product
B000GU3PCE|5|These springs were just what I needed.  It gave me more pressure on my clutch plates and eliminated my slipping issue.  Barnett makes quality products!
B00FDJW5PG|5|Great deal and fit finish were nice. Had to hone the plastic down some on the throttle because it was a tight fit and didn't spin freely.  Otherwise great.
B005WTPC2A|3|The wipers work pretty well in heavier rain. I do notice a lot more streaking than my previous OEM (e90 bmw) wipers. I will try another option next time I need to change them out.
B004TRKBOK|5|Must have!  I like that it's a 2-pack: one for me, one for my girlfriend.
B00B7MR9IQ|5|Very easy to install, and as another reviewer said, if you install them and they don't work, flip them around.  They are current sensitive.<br /><br />These change the entire look of my 2013 Silverado.  Opening the door to the bright light looks much more &#34;high end.&#34;<br /><br />Well worth the cost of this upgrade!
B000C39C72|5|So I was a little worried about this since it did not have good reviews, still, I ordered it. It came neatly packaged and was very easy to install. I'm using this on my 65 Mustang so maybe that's why I've had such good luck with it. My car isn't a daily driver at all but I do take it out two or three times a month. Its worked flawlessly. For my application it was worth it and id recommend it.
B0074OZHQM|5|It's something that's simple, but it looks very nice i like it very much.now if i can only find wind visor for this car ill be more than happy that's a 2014 Kia Soul, Benny Rosario.
B00J2CI6B2|4|More of a blue color than I expected, but that is my fault. Nice & bright for bad weather fog lights.
B000COD1D2|3|The product was fine but had to make an adjustment in order for it to work properly.
B000CSIS4U|5|Bike has never run this good. After installing all 4 new plugs, their was pep back in its step. These are great plugs and I will not settle for less. The original plugs lasted 19 years. That is saying something.
B00GYKUOUQ|4|Very bright.
B003DNJ728|5|This cover fits our 2011 Mercedes E350 very well. It is used indoors to keep the cats off the paint. It doesn't cover the very bottoms of the doors, but cats don't get on the bottoms anyway. The elastic feature is nice and provides a nice firm fit.  It's lightweight and easy to fold for reuse. However, we haven't tried putting it back in the bag. We just fold it and put it on the chair. Well worth the money for cat protection.
B009S94NX4|4|These look nice from 10 feet away. From close up you can see that the finish around the edges of the cut-outs is a bit thin (gray showing through the silver).<br />The original Ford covers can be snapped into place with a few swift kicks without removing the lug nuts--these can too, but a couple of the inner clips broke when using that method. No big deal; they're still holding tight.<br />Certainly well worth the price, considering that each one is about the price of a pepperoni pizza!
B001A0J2JO|5|I am using this in my Honda Element. I can literally see out all the windows behind the front seats, including rear door windows and C-pillar windows on both sides of the car. This mirror performs beyond my expectations.
B00IEJP6TO|5|Very good product. It met my expectations.
B0088LJYXC|4|It allows me to see the condition of stylus of phono cartridge. The image is small but sharp. The built-in illumination is very good.
B000A8J97C|5|Received the Ventvisor and packaging showed correct part number (192706). Visors in package had ridge with 2-sided tape running all the way from bottom corner of leading end to bottom corner of rear end. Picture on this site and AVS site shows leading end has a larger untaped tab that is separate from the main ridge. Instructions clearly describe installation involves inserting the leading tab OUTSIDE of the channel and the rest of the taped ridge INSIDE of the channel. This is impossible with the Ventvisors I received. The only way to install is to place entire ridge INSIDE of the channel. This causes window to hit bottom of leading end as it is coming up, especially passenger side (not sure why driver side works better). Most reviews state that no problems were experienced with window clearing bottom of visor. So, I installed visors and left windows up for ~48 hours. This helped and both windows now clear the visors when coming up. Will update this review if things go bad. Other than this, they look great and function really well.<br /><br />UPDATE - Well, it's been 2 months and no problems. The window hitting the bottom of the visor as it is coming up has corrected itself over time. As I mentioned previously, they look great and function very well. I'm changing my rating from 3 to 5 stars. Very satisfied with these visors.
B0096J7VAI|2|These were not bright enough for my center brake light. I like the Putco 230921R-360 much better. Current draw is 110mA.
B000H961YI|5|very neat. can tell just how much charge is in battery. great product. but, don't let it get rained on. does not like water :)
B001EZ3T8A|4|I've been using this product on my 2008 Toyota Prius for about five years.  I've used it to carry various hitch-mounted bike racks (with two bikes) and to occasionally tow a lightweight (16' fiberglass) sailboat on a trailer.<br /><br />The hitch has worked well.  The only complaint is that the powder finish did not adequately protect the product from rust.  The powder finish peeled off when the product started rusting.<br /><br />The Hitch receiver was straightforward to install.  I'm not the most handy guy -- but I was able to do it myself.  The hardest part, as I recall, was the need to make a slice in the facia with a knife.  But this was eminently doable -- even by me.<br /><br />I just got a 2013 Prius and I'm buying a Curt hitch receiver for it as well.
B00BF0X0F6|2|The covers look good from afar but I have had the for less than a month and am already noticing seams coming loose. The back seat cover I have decided to remove because it won't stay on. When we clipped one of the straps broke right off the bat.
B00APRSI6G|5|Work very well, I use this alarm for back up for 2 motor trikes I have 2 pager alarms for bike. just use these for quick in and out of stores. etc. I covered them with gore tex keep them water proof.would buy again.
B000EFOZQG|5|Perfect for 2002 Camry<br /><br />ITS NOT CHROME. BEWARE!<br />It's the grey type.<br />Get this if that's the one you're looking for.<br /><br />BUY BUY BUY!
B001O11G02|5|Being stationed in Italy it is hard to believe that this product is soo cheap and still includes fee shipping.  Can not beat this deal, so I must say if you have to replace your pads do yourself a favor and get a set.
B006DAD2BK|5|I love this exhaust  zero drone. Deep and aggressive when wanted and quiet when needed. I personally did the install myself which was not bad. It took me about 2 hours total to remove my old exhaust and install the new exhaust. The instructions came with it.But it was all a thing of the past once I started it for the first time. It is absolutely worth the money.
B002ONE3WM|5|FORM / FIT / FUNCTION, RIGHT ON,  GOOD VALUE VS OEM PART
B000J41VDM|4|This didnt work so well on my camera lens, however, works great on CD scratches.  Patience required to go through all the steps.
B00I3PS600|4|It is very good product and good quality. Very useful and easy to use. Thank you to get the product in good condition.
B00836L822|5|Great product.  The cut and fit was perfect.  I have purchased several Coverking products over the years, and this product was of the same great quality I have come to expect. This was shipped directly and QUICKLY from Coverking.  Even my return was simple.  Please note, I purchased this for a 2006 Honda Odyssey to help reduce the dash glare on the windshield, but it did not solve this issue.  I determined that this is a design flaw in the the Odyssey -- the dash cover made my visibility extremely poor in the sun.  Perhaps a dark dash mat would work better?  This is not an issue with the mat design... it's an Odyssey issue.  Bummer.
B00PGGLOWQ|5|Installation was a breeze but I was hoping for a return to the 50 mpg I used to get. Unfortunately that didn't happen but my bike starts easily and idles smooth.
B00D3QQUGG|5|Arrived on time. Product is as described and works well.
B00KTHS3PS|5|they fit on my remote control great !!!
B000NBYDWW|5|works great!
B00F7GXNX8|5|Great decal, can't wait to stick this on the back of my truck.
B001C3VQKM|5|This is our 5th one of these over the years. why 5 you ask because as we get new helmets we get new ones. We keep them on the helmets in-case someone ever needs use one. They work great and for those people who have a hard time with the straps and d rings makes life so much simpler and less frustrating.
B00064NWVE|5|This product is great.  Now I no longer have to guess where to stop when parking.  With limited space in our garage I was always stopping to short and the garage door wouldn't close or to close and hitting the garbage cans.  Now I no longer have to guess.  Great buy
B00DU1GD98|4|Works well, it took me a while to fiddle with it and make it work but its an easy install.
B00JQPB3PQ|5|The bumper sticker appears to be of a high quality and is well worth the cost of the product.
B007TY7I3C|4|These look great on my 2006 GMC Yukon XL. Great viewing area. Make sure you take 10 min before installing and Watch a Youtube video how to get your door panels off if you don't know how.. This will save you a lot of hard ache. Also leave your windows at least half way down or all the way unless you have someone to help you hold the mirrors.<br /><br />Pro...<br />Electric Mirrors work great<br />Mirror Defrost works<br />Love the turn signal on the side<br />Bigger Mirrors and a Big blind spot mirror<br />Easy install<br />Tight and dont wiggle or shake.<br />No new wind noise going over the mirrors<br /><br />Con...<br />Not quite level coming off the yukon.. has a small tilt up wards. Doesnt look bad and you cant tell when your driving<br />Passenger mirror is not an &#34;Objects in mirror are closer than appear&#34; mirror.. I really wish it had this!!<br />Seat Remember doesnt work with mirrors anymore.. (not a big deal because they are bigger so my wife doesnt need to adjust them anymore..<br />Turn Signal LED could be brighter but they look good and work
B002818HZY|4|IT WAS NOT THICK ENOUGHT LIKE BUMPER BULLY IT NEEDS TO BE HARDER TO STAND THE BUMPING AND TAPPING OF OTHER CARS.
B005KLBVZW|5|This Split loom was received fast upon ordering it. With the loom holding the strands is wiring together, it was so easy to installing the wiring bundle from the front to the rear on a vehicle I was setting up to tow. It also insured a additional layer of protection for the wires. I highly recommend it's use.
B007CMN4D4|5|Just installed this a few days ago. It took an hour and a half. Hangers and clamps were all spot on. All mandrel bends were perfect. Helped loosen my 7.3 up.
B00KPZECVI|2|Didn't work my car
B008657716|5|Good product, installation a breeze make the car look classy and stylish, the lights are a great addition to the vehicle.
B001T43QCU|5|It fit the Cruiser perfectly and is considerably cheaper than OEM or some other sources.  It's been on the car for about 6 months now and it still looks brand new.
B008U1MOM8|4|If left for several days, it could drain the vehicle's battery. I had a ScanGauge that was smart enough to turn itself on and off. This item does not use much power, but you will notice a voltage drop if you don't turn your car on for several days. Luckily, it's easy to uninstall and links up to my Bluetooth-enabled phone perfectly every time.
B0016I09YM|4|Easy install for my Chevy Camaro.  Why pay dealers over 500 dollars for Fog Lights when you can put them in yourself for a fraction of the cost.  Be careful when handling these connectors because the tabs can be broken easily.
B000B5QFE4|4|Tried the fit on these mirror extensions as soon as they arrived because a previous review stated they do not fit the 09 F150 XLT. They do, indeed, fit very well. I don't know why the wedges for each side are configured differently for the detent hole. The fit for the left mirror is more forced than necessary to get the wedge all the way in to match up the detent hole with the thread. Threads on retaining knobs are a bit loose. I simply added pipe tape to snug them up. Will likely make another detent and glue it into the left wedge to reduce the strain. As is, it could be more difficult with colder weather. Quality of the mirrors and molded plastic is better than I expected. My mirrors have front and mirror side LED turn indicators. Will also make cutout for front portion of turn signals. Mirror side matches perfectly over the LED's. Mirrors are adjustable in all directions. Very nice product.
B000BM8RT8|5|I picked this up to inflate my 33&#34; tires for my nissan xterrra. I have used it a few times already in the snow and cold after a day of wheeling and it has worked as expected. It may not be as fast as some of the other more expensive brands out there but for the money you really can't go wrong. The gauge is not 120psi as stated, it is actually 150psi. I just wish the cord that hooks up to the battery terminals was a little longer and the hose was a quick release and not a value screw on type but for the cost of the unit I can live with it's small faults. If I ever needed another one I would definitely pick this up again!
B008A1BIMA|5|Fit and look nice on wheels.  Wish they were a bit cheaper but They are what I was looking for.
B005C6KIVS|2|Getting a code to link this to your phone could take some deep digging but I was able to link it after about 30 minutes of searching the web for solutions.
B006QUOHJ8|4|This make the front end look awesome, but unlike the OEM mounting with the studs or bolts all around along with alignment tabs, this piece uses studs along the top and crappy little sheetmetal screws along the bottom that strip right out before they are even tight... No tabs for added support either.
B00BVB5V0Q|1|Switch worked perfectly on my 2004 Chevy Venture for one month and then stopped working with the passenger window in the down position. It was easy to change with a quick YouTube video and a little research. It is a slight lighter color then the original but does not make that much difference to me.
B00GB8614E|5|These lights are BRIGHT!!!  If you don't have a good place to mount a light bar, or just don't like the look of a light bar, these are going to be your number one alternative.  These fog lights are just as bright as a full blown light bar.  When the flood and spot lights are on, there is light being projected at all angles.  Going down a backroad at night has never been more pleasant.  I have seen more deer on the side of the road than I ever have.  That's because I COULDN't SEE THEM with just factory headlights.  Highly Recommended!!!
B001EGIN44|5|Initially I was confused if I was even ordering the right filter because Amazon does not provide an exact part number, only a generic description and an assurance by the \\"part finder\\" that it would fit my 1999 323i. However, knowing Amazon's bulletproof return policy I ordered one anyways, as with free shipping it was the cheapest price I could find online for a genuine Mahle filter (ALWAYS only use Mahle/Mann in your BMW, lesser/cheaper filters will destroy your engine). Amazon did send me the correct sized filter as promised, couldn't be happier. I will be ordering all my filter replacements from Amazon from now on.
B00KTJ9I46|5|I can't believe I bought these remotes for $11.95 and did the simple programming included with the remotes and presto!  It works!  Wished I knew about this instead of carrying my original dented and cracked remotes around all this time.  One of the best $11.95 I've<br />ever spent!!!
B000FW7UJC|5|Used primarily in haved tires to allow them to hold air over longer periods of time. Works great!
B000JZYWQO|4|I bought this for a 1996 Civic EX. It bolted right up. I had to re-use the hanger bushings which was expected. I had to purchase this thick metal cone shaped exhaust gasket though, which was not expected but its was a cheap part at a local Napa. As I said before it bolted up with no issues and I attached the hangers (which were slightly different than factory locations so it was slightly crooked, but not too shabby) and was very happy with the end result. You can't beat the price on these mufflers. It's supposed to be slightly louder than factory but I couldn't tell. Sounds stock to me, which is what I wanted.
B00OAKMNH4|5|great part and price
B002XM5G70|5|I bought this exact pump from an eBay seller, (user ID is MTSRV), that prominently claim that they are a &#34;Shurflo authorized dealer&#34;.<br />From the eBay listing description by MTSRV:  &#34;2-Year Warranty (see paperwork). You can buy with confidence as we are an authorized RV retailer and an authorized Shurflo dealer. &#34;<br />Turns out, &#34;authorized dealer&#34; means nothing -- as I found out 7 months later. When the pump began to slightly leak, MTSRV didn't have any use for me, referring me to Shurflo.<br />I contacted Kevin McLean at Shurflo and found him to be both polite and receptive to my problem. He sent a replacement diaphragm assembly, (at no charge), and my pump is now working quietly, smoothly and leak-free.<br />My old Shurflo pump was at least 18 years old and only began to leak after I didn't protect it from freezing.<br />I highly recommend this pump, and Shurflo for their prompt and remarkable customer service.
B000F09CF4|4|works great and guick
B001O7I7FS|5|my 1997 honda civic got the ghostbuster symbol on the windshield because of cloudy headlights. they tried to get me for $100 to restore them... i told them i'll be back. so i bought this stuff & it worked like magic. it comes with the polish, drill operated buff pad and a microfiber towel. i couldn't find my drill, but i still used the buff pad with circular motions, kinda like karate kid( wax on, wax off) waited 10 seconds, then wiped off with the towel. did two more applications and BOOM!!! BRAND NEW HEADLIGHTS!!! took only 5 mins. and saved $80...
B003CH3Z8W|5|I bought this product to use with my 6\\" Griot's ROP. The plate fits and works perfect. This allows me to use pads from 5.5\\" up to 6.5\\". 5.5\\" pads are a lot cheaper and are easier for me to use with better results.  The plate also came with three washers.  Theses are usually about $1 apiece. I feel this plate is a  great product and a great buy. I highly recommend it for either a Griot's or Porter Cable ROP for anyone wanting to use 5.5\\" - 6.5\\" pads.  It makes my Griot's polisher much more usable as I can use not only Griot's pads but also almost any other pad I choose
B004I0ZI6E|5|The taillight came sooner than I thought and fit perfect. The hardest part was getting to the old one.  The clips on the hall of the trunk were difficult to remove.
B001GG2E1U|4|I put this on my car im going with an eightball theme this set it off just perfect. washed car many times still looks new I like it Winning lol.
B007ED7HNY|5|I put these in my '93 Toyota 4x4 last February, they are a direct replacement, pop out the old ones, whip the old ones against a brick wall, put in the Truck Lites - done. I took my truck to a shop to get them to align my lights with their alignment box so I knew they were set up right, but that's up to you.  The cut-offs on these things are amazing, they are the best lights I've had when driving in heavy fog or when it's snowing like crazy, and they have a great spread, both sides of the road are easily visible.  I've driven them in over -40 Celsius and one negative is because they don't put out any heat, the snow can stick to them, but I never experienced it to the point that I had to get out and scrape them off.  They draw a measly 1.2 amp current draw which is a quarter of what my old headlights drew.  They are pricey, but if you consider the other alternatives, buying housings, re-wiring your harness, buying bulbs - that you have to replace - and even then they can break, the Truck Lites are the best option and well worth the money; Amazon has the best pricing on these as well.  They are bullet proof, they can withstand a point blank 20 gauge shotgun blast, have military grade aluminum housings, and they look awesome too.  The  clincher for me was a couple of things: they don't throw light everywhere so that you are one of those boneheads that blinds everyone, and they are DOT and SAE approved, which a lot of aftermarket options aren't.
B003R2U3LE|4|It does a great job at what it is designed to do. Rolling it up when done is a little bit of a issue as it is big and you need some room to keep it out of the way in the car.
B004165JQY|3|First, this jacket is not matte black. It is actually dark gray. Second, the waist zipper does not match with the charger pants. I don't even think that it will match with any other pants since the 360 zipper is way short. It's more like a 270 zipper. Quality is average. They didn't put much care on sewing on the velcro on the tabs for the sleeves or the main torso zipper. Alas, the plastic end of the Velcro tab rubs against my skin and it is annoying. But, nothing a pair of sharp scissor can't repair. The leather quality is average. Don't think they use the premium hide for this because they are not smooth or stiff (as you would expect from a brand new leather jacket). It felt rather....broken-in already. Some people like this but not me. I like to be the one that break this thing in. I have major doubts about their armors (stiff and plasticky) but since I am changing them to sas-tec pads, it won't be a problem.<br />All and all, it's a gamble purchase for me. Thought this would be a decent commuter jacket. I won't lose sleep over this jacket if it start falling apart in 6-month time though.<br />The seller is good though. They work with me to solve the 360 zipper issue. They reimburse me to get it fixed locally.
B000BZGKCG|5|As advertised. Received order promptly. Good value.
B0006L4PZO|5|...for any man who drives a truck, likes NASCAR or who owns a toolbox. Hopefully, this won't be the only Christmas gift - but as a supplement, it will be a hoot and much appreciated. There are some homes and cars that literally are held together by duct tape. May the Force be with us!
B00HDPPBDG|5|Perfect license plate for my E70.
B000GOJW9A|5|Fits Honda Civic 1999 and works just like the OEM<br />this works
B003AYW05Q|5|You won't be disappointed!
B000WJLMRY|5|works as suggested if not better i recommend highly<br />i put allot of mile on my bike and wish i would have purchased much sooner
B00042KQ58|5|No Review
B000WHACHC|5|It was a great addition to our mini van lots of storeage and 4 good cupholders. Seems to stay put, without being mounted to the floor. Its just what we needed.
B0073MH4R0|5|These look great and protect my backseat from my kids.
B00ECTQFQ8|5|Very bright.
B00AFV7DI6|5|Great service! Needs a slight modification for my 2014 Ram 1500 with power folding mirrors as the front clip touches the door when folded in. Easy to install provides the extra view for towing my 33ft travel trailer.
B000IG3QOS|3|I bought this bar to hang clothes in my back seat after I pick them up from the dry cleaners. Its a very sturdy bar - it should hold up a large amount of weight. My only gripe is that it doesn't secure well and slips around.
B000COBGLG|5|Outstanding value!!! Looking for these sockets w/wire pigtails can be costly! Hyundai wanted Over $50 each, and yes I am sure they were beautiful. Bone yard wanted $25 for the pair but I gotta go out to his yard and find the right ones, remove them, then have the honor of paying for them! Amazon you rock at $7 each delivered in 4 days I was able to in stall fog lights on the Santa Fe that look and function as OEM. W/Amazon your can't miss!
B000JFJLP6|5|We have bought a few of these to keep in different locations and they work great
B003SWNVI0|5|I've used it twice already and it works great. It's easy to strap down to the roof rack and it's very secure as well. It also hold a lot more than it looks like it would!
B001LENRWW|5|Used this to replace the bearing in my Fisher & Paykel dryer. I need a deep thin walled socket and this was perfect.
B004804NNI|5|Looks nice.
B000CITK8S|4|I left my baby in the garage when I went on a week long vacation.  She wouldn't start when I returned.  By the time I researched, ordered, and received the Battery Tender Jr 12V, another week or so had passed.  I read the directions and hooked her right up the night I got it.  She started right up the next morning and has been going since.  Some friends recommend to plug in every night but I just plug in when I won't be riding for a week or so and have had no problems.<br /><br />Amazon had the best price when I ordered it.<br /><br />The 4 stars is because I wish the cord that plugs into the wall was longer.
B00EC0ZJD2|5|Perfect price and a great fit! The wanted $80.00 for the same mirror.
B00RXVCYOY|5|great plate surround
B009IF1NF4|5|Works perfect for less than half the price of oem.
B0033MKICC|5|Sound deadener/ insulation is a nice add on to your Jeep. It is easy to install and it looks good when installed. The directions are clear and no no guess work. The kit when installed cuts down the heat from the roof when it is hot,hot.
B000IYDEPG|5|This is a Great quality wiper blade. Comes with everything that you need for easy installation on any type of wiper arm
B001P2BSKI|5|These brackets, paired with the Westin 27-6120 running boards, fit our 2012 Traverse perfectly. Installation was straight forward with the right tools. Pricing was competitive with other sites but Amazon had these in stock when I wanted them.
B00AQP168O|4|I have two red/white in front of my truck. They have great warning for the money and visible from long distances
B000GU0YFK|5|Good quality made pegs for good price. Purchased due to AIH pegs are no longer procurable. Have purchased Kuryakyn products in the past. Good quality products.
B00796UQHA|4|I just put the stubby antenna on my '07 xterra. I like how &#34;low profile&#34; it looks. No more long antenna that swings all over the place when off-roading. It was also really easy to install. Just unscrew the stock antenna, and screw this one in. The only problem that I have encountered is that my auto tuning head unit, will not pick up all of the available FM stations. But I have a preset that will play fine, it is just not discoverable when I go to tune into it. Other than that, great product.
B0047YIXZO|5|just like it looks on the picture, anybody who likes volcom should get this, and how it off to the world
B005GXT7B4|5|I brought this piece for my 95' Toyota Camry during college! Everyone enjoyed it, superfly!
B000BG1X54|5|A simple and cheap solution to transfering liquids, particularly gasoline.  The one-way valve works efficiently and the hose length is sufficient to easily extend well into a gas tank filler from five-gallon can.  With little practice, you can master the technique of starting the flow and taking the level down to nearly nothing in the can in a couple minutes.  I take an old rag to wipe the can end of the tube as I remove it, then hold it above the level of the car's gas cap to allow the excess to drain into the car.  Then use the rag to wipe the car end of the tube as it is removed.  Only a couple drops of gasoline is lost that way and I have safely completed the task.  I hang up the tube for an hour to allow full evaporation.  I imagine this could be used for transferring any kind of liquid, including water beds and pools, assuming the tube is long enough to reach.  Highly recommended.
B000IY9I06|5|Got it for the coated hub and love the look.  No fitment issues for our Sienna.  Too bad price went down a couple of days after purchase and I didn't catch it.
B005UO6EWE|2|I thought I would try it because of the price compared to a brand I have used in the past. The truck was still very hard to start after using it. I didn't see any change. I bought the other brand again and the truck now starts good again in the cold weather.
B004HOCH92|5|part came in a certified kia parts package and fit perfectly as o.e.m part. A quick tip having a non working brake light also affects the kia's cruise control so don't feel like you got a broken cruise function it just happens to work in conjunction with the brake light switch.
B004ZK6XN4|5|works perfect on my atv
B00JZQXJ3K|5|This hitch went on in less than an hour!  No need to remove the bumper cover or the tow hook.  Wiring was simple plug and play.  Easy as pie!
B000C9GYTA|5|Great product and price. It works perfectly and looks great. Better deal found here than anywhere else. Would recommend it to friends.
B00IKPES2S|4|This part fit my 1998 Toyota Sienna very well.  Color slightly off from pic and original color, but not outlandishly so.
B007ZDNKJI|5|It was a gift. Fit perfect. My boyfriend loves it
B004GBUSK6|3|I like the look and feel of this strut bar, however I had to make some changes to it as it interfered with a cable attached to the top of passenger side strut tower. Involved cutting out a section then welding a piece on to regain strength.
B000LNY1MY|5|Outstanding
B007QTCI3U|5|Good quality fast shippin - highly recommended!!!
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Amazing. I use Fabric Guard on the canvas on my boat. Water beads right off.
B000CO869Q|5|Love it. Perfect if you do 4 or 6 cylinder jobs. Just tall enough to where you can sit or stand, while still being able to work comfortably. Have not tried any 8 cylinders, though it should hold most small blocks and some big blocks based on weight capacity.
B001FS89Q8|2|Having issues with it leaking - discovered it after removing the air filter box.  We purchased it with a new coolant resevoir also.
B00MLI6OHC|4|Works great. I did have an issue while installing the switch I forgot to disconnect the battery and fried the wire harness. Upon further inspection I noticed that there is no fuse in the hot lead from the battery to the relay. After replacing the the wire harness and installing an inline fuse between I haven't had any problems. I'm considering ordering another to mount just below this one.
B00029WYDU|1|Terrible packaging. It leaked because the box was to big and nothing to take up the space.
B00ODTTZ9G|5|Love it thanks
B000PUDSMC|1|Do Not Order This Product! IT IS NOT AS PICTURED
B001J4P4BG|5|I will add to my existing review from Dec. 2011. I've had this a year and a half and still no leaks. I've had my truck through car washes numerous times and I live in WA. state, yes it rains here \\"ALLOT\\"! The drain lines have never been installed so if it leaked I would certainly know. I've hauled tall to small and used in every open position very user friendly, and it works, never have I had to remove it to haul anything and it has never been removed. I like the security I have a locking tailgate, this cannot be opened in the fully closed position without first opening the tailgate.<br /><br />I was dreading opening the box according to other reviews on damage. Evidently Bak took heed, the packinging was awesome. Very heavy cardboard, inside the bakflip had molded foam in plastic around it, very well protected, no flaws at all, you could run over it with a semi, very impressed with the packing. Installation was very simple, I recommend 2 people it's a little awkward to sit in place by yourself. I drove home from a friends in a torrential downpour, opened up the tailgate the bed was completely dry even with the new seals not yet conformed to the truck bed. Looks great also, and very user friendly to operate. I highly recommend this for looks and especially security. [[ASIN:B001J4SSBE BAK Industries 35101 BakFlip HD All Metal Tonneau Bed Cover]]
B00EKN8FXC|5|It is so nice to have the light without all the heat of the incandescent bulbs!
B008BE04C6|3|Maybe it's my eyes (I'm getting old) but I thought they would make night driving easier for me according to other reviews I've read.
B005DUMD3O|2|had to reinforce the flimsy clamp system in order to get the clamps to stay put. Once reinforced, it operates well.
B000BUU5UO|3|absorbancy was not bad, but no softness
B00DP7NS6S|4|They were nice and look good.
B005GTD0RU|5|This ice scraper works wonderfully. It is also a great conversation starter. It not only has the furry inside, but the handle is also furry. It's super warm.
B00DXP9VC2|5|Arrived in a timely manner as described.
B000KJQ0B4|5|Best unit out there!  Installation was a breeze and learning how to adjust it's settings is easy.  I liked how it automatically self-adjusted based on hill decent or climb with it's built in gyro-scoptic electronics.
B000HZA2LK|5|Haven't even taken them out of the box yet.  Got them so I wouldn't have to buy snow tires for the 530i.
B006ODTR0G|5|I purchased the Genuine Honda 08F53-T0A-100 Exhaust Pipe Finisher on Amazon, from e-PartsPros. They are both very reputable companies, so you be confident knowing that you'll receive exactly what you purchased. I purchased the Exhaust Pipe Finisher on 11/4, and received it on 11/8. The Genuine Honda Exhaust Pipe Finisher is made very well, and is extremely stylish. It fits the 2012-2015 Honda CRV. The installation instructions are not included with any of the Genuine Honda Accessories, but can be easily downloaded at Honda.com. The instructions are very detailed, easy to follow, and include pictures of each step. Installation is very easy! Tools and Supplies Required: Ratchet, 10 mm Socket, Torque Wrench. The Exhaust Pipe Finisher is made of stainless, so you'll never have to worry about it rusting! In my opinion, the Honda Exhaust Pipe Finisher is well worth the money. The Exhaust Pipe Finisher adds a lot of style to the back of the Honda CRV! I installed the Exhaust Pipe Finisher on a 2015 Honda CRV, and would definitely do it again! Genuine Honda Accessories cost a little more, but you get exactly what you pay for!<br /><br />The Exhaust Pipe Finisher slides over the tailpipe, and is secured in place with a 10mm bolt. I put this on my brand new $35,000.00 2015 Honda CR-V and it looks great! You Will Not Be Disappointed!<br /><br />Instructions: Slip the Exhaust Pipe Finisher over your Tailpipe, and tighten the 10mm bolt to 7 ft lbs.
B007CMQC06|5|Greatstuff
B00M0FSRTE|3|they don't work like regular turn signal bulbs they make my turn signals blink really fast
B00YZNIJ9M|5|Nice decal
B005NLQAHS|5|I've had it plugged in for 2 months and had zero problems with it so far. It connects easily to my S5. I use it on my 03 F-150 and pait it with the Torque app.
B002SIR91A|1|Do not use for avalanche rescue or snow science.  Two people in our party were using this exact shovel(purchased at Costco) to dig snow pits and both snapped their shovel from the handle making them in operable.  This was casual digging - imagine if they were in an actual rescue scenario.<br /><br />I refuse to go into the backcountry with anyone bringing this shovel.  Buy a Black Diamond, Voile, or BCA shovel.  How much is your friend's life worth?
B0075EAKKY|5|Awesome cable. This was a great price. I was shipped fast. And it worked perfectly. I have a 1981 Yamaha xs 850, shaft drive. Nice to be able to see my rpm's again.
B005ADVVVY|5|good item, works well
B004G9VIXE|1|My original actuator had a burned out motor after six years of use.  I bought this Dorman aftermarket part to replace it.  A visual comparison of the parts showed that the castings/molds weren't quite as clean, but the part installed and worked fine - for two months.  I took it apart to find that the big plastic gear had been worn down, so having saved the original unit, I swapped the gears, reassembled and replaced it.  This time it lasted four months.  Again, the plastic gear had been worn out and even had two chipped teeth.  Closer comparison of the units revealed that the worm gear attached to the motor shaft has much sharper teeth than the OEM unit, which is probably what leads to the prematue failures.  I bought the Mopar OEM unit here on Amazon for less than $30 more than the Dorman part and installed it.  If you value your time, I recommend you do the same.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Recently used this hitch mounted luggage carrier for a trip to Destin, FL. Mated with the Lund luggage protector we were so happy. In driving around I have seen hitch mount luggage carrier on other cars sitting at an angle like it rocks. The Pro Series sits solit as a rock. There is no rock or tilt. We are VERRY HAPPY with this item!
B0030DKDY2|4|my tailgate sagged hopelessly until I installed the new lifts. direct fit, no installation issues
B001O15D7E|2|These are cheap and deservedly so. In my case they lasted 4 years.  The OEM ones lasted 11 years.  The seller insists on $8 for the replacement, which is probably close to their cost.
B0006H8AE0|5|Great product. Fit perfectly.
B00G186POK|5|Very bright LED's. Such a BIG difference over the yellow OEM bulbs. I would go any brighter that these. Any more brightness and it would be uncomfortable inside the car. No regret here ! All worked fine.
B006A90UWI|5|high quality and it stands up well.  Worth the price.  it can be tough to put the keys on but that's because of the key and fob being so fat.
B005ALD1SC|5|Great antenna have now two both working great and SWR easy to correct.
B001KW00NY|5|Performs as described.  I asked questions before purchase about slipping and got many helpful replies from other Amazon customers.  This did not slip for me either, no need for mat under it.  It's very handy for moving or to just keep in the car if you want to put it on top to carry extra items with a full carload, etc.  Good rugged fabric and seams.
B00BITJZ6M|5|My husband love the price and was easy to assemble.
B000GU0MMU|4|Works, though very tedious, takes to long and to many pumps.  If you need to change your oil this way, prayers, but this will do the job.
B004I1F22S|4|I was so glad to find this part brand-new for half the price and cutting out the middle man.  Thank you
B0009IK4SG|4|Great way to keep the original stainless wipers on my dodge
B004OXHUBQ|5|Car works and runs great
B001B57M3G|5|I installed this kit in my '05 STI. It's been going strong for 30k miles now. It's exactly the OEM quality you'd expect, without the dealer's markup.
B000CK6W0U|5|very good thank you. greetings MIKE.
B000BWCERY|5|I needed a way to transfer fuel from a 5 gallon container into my boat fuel tank while in the<br />water  and in the boat slip without leaning over the side of the boat and trying to manage to<br />pour fuel into the side mounted inlet. I mounted the Mr. Gasket in a Plastic tool box, connected<br />the electrical leads to a 12v cigarette connector, plugged into boat dash, and the pump<br />transferrs 5 gal. of fuel thru Ace hardware lines to boat tank in about 8 minutes with no spills.<br /><br />Great little pump!!
B000VZJH6W|5|Used this to install my fuel tank in the front of the boat to get better weight distribution in the boat for deer hunting setup after removing the trolling motor, seats, and battery from the front of the boat.  The boat rode great and I never had any problems.  Got a nice buck this year.
B00DR14U0K|5|I was a bit hesitant about purchasing this top after hearing some of the reviews/horror stories of the Robbins economy top (no holes, alignment issues, thin material). This sierra top is nothing like those.<br /><br />The quality is excellent for the price, the ONLY issues I have with it are minor - there is a tiny blue tint to the rear plastic window and 2 of the pre-stamped mounting holes were about 5mm off their mark. Thats it. I consider those both to be irrelevant considering the price of this top. Everything else - vinyl quality, color, look, fit, etc are all SPOT ON.<br /><br />My dad and I installed this top ourselves and we were able to get the old top off and this one on in around 4-5 hours (we are both experienced mechanics). The installation of the top is very straigthforward, the trick is putting things on in the right order. We watched a youtube video (search miata top install) by mark golberg and it was extremely helpful. There are also some great writeups on miata.net<br /><br />All said and done I spent less than $250 and one afternoon getting this top on. I highly recommend doing it yourself - what good is a miata unless you're going to work on it yourself?<br /><br />A few tips:<br /><br />- Make sure you get new cables - it's worth it. Found some on ebay for around $35<br /><br />- We didnt replace the rain rail - yes, it cracks but we recovered the whole thing with 2&#34; Gorilla tape and it has performed flawlessly so far. All it is is a plastic slip designed to funnel water into the main rubber rail.<br /><br />- We put our top on in 40 degree weather and it was very hard to stretch once it got closed. Dont force anything, you have to let it work its way onto the frame over a few days. We had to extend the top latches all the way out (they adjust by hand) and also move the latch mounts on the visor out one bolt to get the initial latch purchase. After some time and heat we could then slowly return everything back to stock but it took a coupledays - you dont want to force it.<br /><br />- Buy the right size rivets. I think they're 5/32&#34;<br /><br />- Removing the rivets from the old top isnt the easiest thing because they like to spin when you drill them out. 2 man job here - one to hold the back, one to drill.<br /><br />- I didnt rivet the new top to the rain rail, its been fine so far. Dude in the video said he doesnt either.<br /><br />- There are a lot of little bits, brackets & parts - dont lose anything.<br /><br />- Dont forget any rivet holes, we did and had to backtrack a couple times...
B009D5OS0G|5|Used this for a 2002 jeep grand Cherokee. You unscrew the old one, mine was a Phillips, and unplug the old one. Reverse the order and you get four levels of fan control! It was only max or nothing for a while. The old one was corroded from condensation dripping on it.
B000AMGZ1Q|5|It lends a bit of class to my big ol' 4 wheeldrive van and when I convert her to a mini motor home I'll buy another extinguisher to place by my bed in the rear. Classy looking but almost got me in trouble with the Highway Patrol because he thought it was a beer can within my reach. Opps...I teased him but he still gave me a ticket for speeding...yeah I know and I slowed down now. Seriously these would look good in any custom rig.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Thank you
B009OHH4FO|5|FINALLY ! MADE IN THE U.S.A. ! THANK YOU ! These are well made , not some cheap junk , so you will pay a little more for them ! I ordered them and three days later , here they are before the delivery date ! I highly recommend these welders pliers ! Don't skimp on your tools ! I'm so tired of all the cheap import crap , being sent to our Country ! To clean the nozzle , unscrew it from the gun and use the pliers to scrape the spatter out of it ! Boy that is so hard ! Take it off so you don't ruin your contact tip ! These pliers work great ! Happy welding !
B006X8BFLQ|5|A perfect fit and the looks are great. I was very supprised at the quality and construction but this product is awsome for the price. You wont go wrong.
B000BQQQ56|5|great!
B000KKLLFS|5|These are much sturdier than the ones that came with my car and replacing the old with clean new ones is good. I was only planning on replacing one on my car after the guy at the shop left one off.. but I replaced all of them cause they just look cleaner and are less worn down in material.
B001GJ3FIS|2|For some reason, the water pressure is lower with this nozzle. I got another one at homedepot and the pressure on the other way is stronger at the Jet setting.
B00JINPK2S|5|If you do not want swirls Grit guard is a must!
B000AMW0F6|1|I bought this fuel filter to replace the one on my Jeep.  The old one was a Wix filter.  I took the old one off and tried to put this new Fram Filter on but the 2 outlet connectors are too close together to allow for the two rubber hoses to coonect at the same time.  I could not get the 2 hoses to connect so I took it off and put the Wix back on.  I will be replacing the old Wix with a new Wix filter, not a Fram.
B00CMUD8E6|5|Honda OEM engine air filter at a fraction of Honda dealership parts department price.
B008FCDM0A|4|Arrived on time. Works great on my Chevy truck. Would buy again!
B004XEKJUK|5|Came on time, looks great works great! Love my honda!
B008I7NJ6O|5|Perfect fit, no nonsense install, just works!
B002YKI7KO|5|Grat price
B001MV1LE0|5|Well made, strong, easy to work with one hand on motorcycle and one ratchet. Auto return spring is great. Bought two sets of two, will buy more when needed. Hands down better than traditional straps.
B00KGYKHOO|4|Solid mounting and looks good on my bike. Not as bright as I would like but is sufficient for the price.
B0002JMFKM|5|Used the product and recharged the system.  So far so good!
B010MNR3Y0|1|Easy to install and look great, quick 5 minute install.<br /><br />Update after being on for 30 days I am standing next to my truck while my friends were saying how great it looked. With no one within 10 feet of the truck the tail light cover just fell off. Product looks great but you do have to do some customization (new silicon seal and sealant to get it to stay together).
B005ZHFXKU|5|Great product no issues with instructuions or packaging.  Works as expected and i'm very satisfied with the product.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to my friends.
B00HJDY6PG|5|Fits in my 2015 Highlander perfectly and keeps items from rolling around
B0076AUCKU|4|Does what it's supposed to.<br />No problems with delivery and works fine.<br />Looks exactly like the OEM antenna and FM reception is the same as before.
B001LHVOVK|5|A misfire on cylinder 4 turned out to be a loose wire. What would that have cost me at a dealership or garage?<br />$15.00 for this was a steal.....................
B00OM90ICA|4|It was very good. but there wasn't any instruction with items.
B007FTV9Q8|5|I love my new leopard sunshade!! I was kind of worried since their are no pictures on the product that it was not going to meet my expectations, but it looks just how I imaged. Its a good size, covers my entire windshield. Its big enough to be compadable with most vehicles. The print is perfect !!! It looks like i paid a lot more than I did for it.
B004VG88MQ|4|Nice material. Easy to move into place as long as you have enough liquid underneath. Just using a credit card or flexible plastic tool works out the bubbles & wrinkles nicely. Not reflective so very hard to notice.
B004RNR9BY|5|Easy to use, great for our RV. Metal ends and HD hose
B00AOGL60I|5|Will this fit a Chevy sonic 2014
B000OUXAAI|5|I use these brushes to spread glue on my woodworking projects.  These brushes are the same quality as the ones one can buy from Rockler or Woodcraft and are only a fraction of the cost.
B0009JKGII|3|I had a layer of something built up on my white car that normal washing just wouldn't clean off.  I suspect maybe some road oil.  It had been there a while and it did take a little scrubbing, but this stuff did help me get it off.  There were some spots of tar and they didn't seem to come off after using this.
B00063XX5U|5|Great product for cv axle bands
B006X98A7C|5|This battery replacement restored my &#62;7 yr. old UPS back to service although it was a vey tight fit and took a little work to get the cover back on though it is doable.  I noticed that there is a little ridge on the corners, which at first look identical to the OEM battery but on close inspection is a little larger than the OEM battery. Not much but just enough to make it a challenge to slide the cover back on.  It could probably be filed down.  It wouldn't take much to do it as the ridge is jut a fraction larger.  It's been working without issue for more than 6 months now.  Very happy with this purchase.
B0009IQZPW|2|These foam applicators have sharp edges along the mold lines that can scratch painted surfaces. I would suggest that you stay away from these in favor of microfiber pads.
B005G112LO|5|Gift for a father who has a bad hand.  Works great and cleans the windows very good.
B00NJ5EUHC|5|Awesome product
B00P9E5BJM|5|Very well pleased with this product. Arrived on time and in mint condition. Couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase.
B0049Z1NKI|2|Had a heck of a time putting my BMW key in the keyring.  Once in there it doesn't move cuz it's too tight.  This keyring is really meant for little else than a few thin skeleton keys.  If you'll be using with several keys, you'll have to add another keyring to it.  This thing is way too small.  By itself it looks very nice though.
B0016SMJAO|4|Hard to say just yet, need time to see how it holds up , but it seems like it should be fine. My friends boot is holding up well he said and is part of the reason i bought from you. So in a year or so i should be able to tell you more.
B0006AZ1RQ|2|description didn't mention the fact you have to use reflective tape to get a tach reading.Very inconvenient in some places.
B000FPY7AY|1|I bought this gauge along with the fuel, oil pressure, and water temp gauges; none of them worked. Specifically, once the engine is running, all the gauges just climb up all the way. Don't waste your money like I did.
B00BQYCJNU|4|as advertised as pictured but after washing all corners and most of edges curl up tightly. tag on each towell is stiff and rough it should be cut off before useing, could scratch surface
B00860WLPI|4|For the price and quality of these gloves they actually lasted me a whole year! Awesome!
B0081SBSPY|5|This kit had the pieces to rebuild my starter motor. It didnt come with instructions but its fairly straightforward. Way cheaper than buying all the pieces individually.
B00BCCI2RI|5|Very comfortable to lay or kneel on.  Carrying handle makes it easy to carry.  Much better then laying on the ground.  The only complaint I have is that you can damage the back of the mat if you have it on a rough surface.  I have used it on gravel, but I place a tarp under the pad to mitigate damage.  The tarp also helps being able to slide the mat while you are laying on it.
B00HNMLQAG|5|Hard, durable and cheap = perfect
B001W6LGGS|5|GREAT QUALITY EQUIPMENT. EXCELLENT IMAGE.EASY TO INSTALL.<br />ONLY CONS; NOT POSSIBLE TO CHANGE A CHANNEL IN ORDER TO USE TWO CAMERAS IN ONE VEHICLE.<br />USER MUST SEAL BACK OF CAMERA TO AVOID HUMIDITY INSIDE.
B009UODIII|1|It is defective .
B000A8FMLO|5|Nice item. Its easier to drop a strap over this hook than try to fit the strap over a trailer ball.<br />A must have for every hard working truck !!!
B004A65WPI|5|The new box and shaft purchase was worth every penny.  These Dodge boxes make a world of difference in steering!
B00AKAMM8S|5|Works as it should
B001S82VNM|5|It works perfectly and it was simple to install! No tools required just a light to see what you are doing and some common sense!
B004N6YRDS|4|Long story short, I had high expectations for this product, and they went above and beyond. I was a bit confused at first about the power source for the LED lights, but then I just hooked them to spare wiring I had for the amp in my trunk that powers my sub. All in all, worth every penny. Maybe could be a tad bit brighter though
B0073WSIX4|5|Fluorine spray where have you been??! So wonderful and makes conditioning even quicker than with the cream. This is the only brand I use for my leather sofa and Sears in vehicle. No other brands smell as great (real leathery smell) or work as well in my opinion. I tried a couple others years ago but like I sai this is the only one I use now
B008AGBFJG|5|hard to find anywhere else.  just what my husband needed to finish a restoration on the go cart
B000HTNODE|5|Ah, soo much better to use than the crappy cheapo specific gravity float testers.<br />I had 3 of the cheapo's that never agreed with each other and got worse.<br />I finally broke down and bought this... wish I hadn't waited soo long.
B00BG9I9RA|3|be careful when install, breaks easilly
B0007TQWKQ|5|Very pleased with the results. This product delivers as advertised. It's easy to use; just follow the istructions, and you can't go wrong.
B001E1RVKQ|5|This stuff is awesome. It works by far the best at de-icing the windshield. I've used Rain-X 2in1 and Peak De-icer and neither work as well. In addition to actually melting the ice it also has the lowest operating temperature that I've seen from washer fluid, -27. I mix it with some Rain-X treatment to get the benefit of Rain-X. Worth every penny in these New England winters.
B00JIK1M1E|5|Very fresh aroma without being chemical.
B00ELR3XM0|5|Fast shipping!!! Will definitely recommend and buy again. Seller also provided video link for installation tips and instructions A+
B006BE0ZBS|5|Easy to program with instructions provided.  I had a local lock and key place cut key. They only charged me $2
B002VVIC06|1|Fell apart almost the first time I used it.  Horrible investment due to quality.  Thing blew apart  made me think something was seriously wrong
B004NEFQ9Y|5|I bought this product so I wouldnt get pulled over, works well. Even the officers wava at me now..thanks.. .
B004NUZ50I|5|It was everything it needed to be. Great that it comes in a kit with the water pump holder and the 32mm fan wrench. Not much room for a normal wrench in there. Fast shipping too.
B000GU0MMU|5|Disregard the instructions telling you to not pump past the 10-20 pumps to get it started. If you pay attention you will notice the oil draining slower, it is fine to pump again to get it moving again.<br /><br />Make sure you hold the pump mechanism down. Everything just pops off (it doesnt screw on) so if you dont put downward pressure, it will pop off and you will lose your suction.<br /><br />It took about 30-mins to drain 4 quartz of oil. Not terribly long.. it is probably the same amount of time as lifting your car, getting under and draining it the old fashion way.<br /><br />I like it, it was very easy and clean. I live in an apartment so jacking up a car is not ideal. When it was done draining, I lifted the tube up and gave it a few more pumps to help drain it. Everything pops off cleanly and I just put the container in my car and drove it to the auto parts place to drain. No oil anywhere.<br /><br />Just a tip: You will know when it is done extracting oil when it starts gurgling, kind of like when you get to the end of drinking soda from a straw.
B004BHZR1A|4|This was a decent product, but it was a little big to fit where the dodge emblem went, but it still hasn't fallen off, and looks great. I would have liked to know that is was a sticker basically, at first I thought it would have been something that you just switch out with the Dodge emblem, but you can either take the old one off and stick it over, or just put it over the old emblem. Overall, no complaints.
B000CODH0E|5|These were very easy to install and look great on my old truck.  Will make tying down ropes much easier than threading rope thru molded holes in truck post
B005FL5HFW|4|These appear to be a great set so far.  The outer packaging was too flimsy for the weight though, and was extremely mangled by the time it was delivered.  YouTube videos made this a very easy DIY job for my husband and sons.
B00JH2GMMC|5|Perfect replacement for my 2010 GMC Sierra.  Relatively easy to install.  Watch the video that someone else mentioned first though.
B00DQRSK9C|5|Best for the Price
B00CNA2BV6|5|I used this to dry off my motorycycle and car. Works great, costs less than the competition, but works the same. Great value!
B00C0MXRU6|5|Easy to apply. Looks good on the car, like they belong there. A perfect addition to the car's decor. Heavenly!
B000QX9I7W|5|Easy to put on and looks great. Would buy again. Great price for four and matches the color of my car.
B000CSOLYQ|5|I have a 04 ford escape that had a misfire on clynder 5 and tested the the coil to see if it sparks and it didnt so bought this one and it works just had to cut the old rubber ring around the old coil to place an extra rubber seal b/c it didnt seal the hole all the way but it does work so far:)
B00009WC2Q|4|A necessity item to have if you want to run accessories. Heavy gauge wires.
B000GQ6LF6|5|A half hour to install on my GMC Terrain.  Holes all matched up perfectly.  I would recommend this hitch to a friend for sure. Can`t beat this deal with free shipping.
B004HAC8R2|5|Used this as a set on my trailer I pull behind my motorcycle. Worked better than expected. I was worried it would be dim in the daylight. After I hooked them up and saw how bright they are, I am no longer worried!! Very Bright!! I used a set of red lights for the Park and Brake lights as well as a third brake light strip. Used the same brand LEDs in amber for the turn signals. Back of my trailer lights up so well, I know other drivers will notice it. I feel much more safe than with a single set of lights on the back of my trailer.
B000630J9S|2|My Mustang G T is Black Int w/ red overtones and the PINK just dosent get it! The Price is Great-looks and feels solid and IF it were RED it would be mounted and a 5 Star Rating bit it STICKS out like a sore thumb..one of the wires attached to it was RED-looks as if I will choose another color and Delivery was FAST as ...well-ya know where I am going- Amazon produces but someone dropped the ball saying it was RED....havent sent it bask yet but I will contact them and purchass another color!
B000GU0MMU|5|If you have lots of small engines and service yourself. This is what the Doctor ordered. Save time and money.
B000E4HQO0|3|Quality is alright. Mirror housing fit and finish is very good. But, the mirror itself is of lower quality and more distorted in the reflections than in the original mirror. In addition, the delivery took much too long compared to other auto parts online companies I have used before.
B00IZLOA2U|1|This floor mat is not custom as the product description states. It does not custom fit my 2015 Tahoe, it is just a square piece of plastic, not worth money, I'm returning mine.
B00230L658|5|I read and researched quite awhile before deciding on this plow.  I have this mounted to my 2004.5 Polaris Sportsman and it it the perfect width.  Wait until you have your mount, and push tubes before looking at the instructions as it takes the booklets from all 3 for it to all make sense.  Also the mounting hardware for the plow is included with the pushtubes.  Very sturdy and can't wait to try it out.
B000CITK8S|5|Does what it's advertised to do, especially for vehicles that sit for extended periods of time.
B00749XDHM|1|did not fit like i hoped so its useless to me, wish i would have known before i bought it, i also only received one not even the two like i had purchased.
B0076D459G|3|It does not fit the REAR wiper for a 2008 Saturn Astra as advertised.
B00RY9OPHY|3|Trying to keep this on my visor was an issue.  It kept sliding down til I cracked it when trying to get it to stay put.  I don't use it.  I'm now trying the anti-glare glasses.
B001Y91KIM|5|Arrived quickly. Wheel covers were easy to attach.  Look great!  Very pleased with quality for price paid and would order again.
B007KCYKY8|5|Looks great, fits perfect, good price!
B001D6GYLO|2|Well, I don't know if it really works though it does put out voltage.  I connected it to the SAE connector I have installed for my plug-in charger before I left to work and came home to find my battery completely drained.  Upon further investigation, I found that the voltage was backward from what it should be.  I clipped-up some SAE plugs I had on hand and made a reversing adapter for it and it is charging now.  I suppose I'll see later this afternoon/evening if it is doing any good, but I am a bit upset and hope it didn't ruin my 3-month old battery.
B007S3N5RC|5|Fit my 2003 Chinook exactly & holes for mounting lined up exactly. PVC is not quite as thick as the one that came on the RV, but plenty sturdy enough to do the job. Plenty of room for the hose & fittings.
B000MLF7CS|4|I bought this scanner a week ago and dose everything that I need it to do, I would recommend it to friend's.
B003AOKKWQ|5|Exactly as advertised. Good mount.
B004107292|5|It is what I ordered It is a use full tool for anyone stocking up for the unknown or needing a gas siphon.
B00OZ42J4C|1|didn't fit my Honda CRV
B0006IX7WY|5|I love these. Not only do I use them in the refrigerator I also use them in the cabinets. They are wonderful for keeping everything in place.  I have an opening on the front of the sink that is a great place to keep hot pads, doggie treats etc. and these bars keep them in place when going down the road.
B00DUR7EEU|5|I got this for my PC case and it goes on good and looks great. If you are familiar with applying decals then you should know that this doesn't come with masking tape. It went on very easily and smoothly and looks awesome!
B0031W1FUI|5|excellent product more than I expected
B003PIQ3BO|5|Nice Hitch, easy install. If you have after market exhaust you will need longer exhaust insulators, which can usually be found at O'Reilly for $5 each.
B0060GCM7C|2|Rubber squeegie ripped off first use
B0091XPJ4O|3|Easy install.<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />-add water and alcohol (100ml) and 5 to 10 drops of baby shampoo in a spray bottle<br />- you will need a heat gun or a blow dryer<br />- clean and dry surface area , spray with your mixture<br />-apply and center/move the sticker<br />-rub out the bubbles and apply heat from heat gun<br /><br />Only draw back, sticker leaves residue on the inside. Waited a week and sticker residue blended in.
B008KSIOHU|5|The alternator works great once I finally got it installed in a space with &#34;zero&#34; wiggle room.  The problem I have is there wasn't enough information about the fuse that needed to be upgraded.  I blew 3 of the original fuses before a Honda mechanic told me to upgrade to a 65 amp fuse and it hasn't blown since.
B00KLKKJ8C|4|Works great no leaks nice and snug, con: peacock valve is taller that stock so makes fuel line have a hump before reaching carb.
B001EAQTRI|5|I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone and a 2008 Lexus ES with an Aux-In port.  Unfortunately, when I use the car's Aux-in port and also connect the phone to the car's power port (which is almost a necessity when using the Note 2's Google Navigation app), there is a very noticeable whine that appears &#34;over&#34; the sound from the phone.<br /><br />Using this device completely eliminates the whine.  Absolutely perfect.
B0030Z65YM|2|I PAINTED HORNS BLACK AND INSTALLED HORNS ON MY CAR... HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED, NOT AS DESCRIBED, NOT VERY LOUD, POOR SOUND QUALITY. TOOK HORNS BACK OFF OF MY CAR. PUT OLD ONES BACK ON....<br />NOW IM STUCK WITH THESE POOR QUALITY HORNS....<br />I HATE THROWING MONEY AT PRODUCT THAT DONT LIVE UP TO THE MANUFACTURER'S CLAIMS....<br />DAMN IT...
B00G5C3ZZ4|5|great length,works great
B000EALHHG|2|I was dissatisfied. My oil spots aren't very big and it didn't do anything for them.
B001AM8E9G|5|Excellent smooth riding shocks. A big difference in the handling of the vehicle. The price was right, happy with the purchase.
B004IARR9U|5|These are great for use as custom bump stops, can be cut down for shorter applications, or left long for a softer bottoming experience. I use them on a lot of custom suspension jobs, and have had a set on the back of my Tacoma for a couple years with great results. The 3/8&#34; stud makes attachment easy, and they're a great value for polyurethane bumps too.
B00C3OMGR6|4|Wasn't the exact replacement but works well.
B003U6LG2W|5|Easy to install and sounds great! I would purchase this setup again if i get another truck. Lots of whistle!!
B002GP87NO|5|I bought it, because I love watching all of the Batman Movies. :)
B004QPIVO2|1|Quick delivery, great value and usually a good product but, this product does NOT work with \\"small engines\\" as represented.<br /><br />While I've been using Castrol products for more than fifty years and have always had great experiences with their oils, this one failed in use with my garden equipment. This oil slows small 2-stroke blowers, trimmers and lawn equipment to a near stop. I took my new blower in for repairs and the service mechanic knew immediately that it was this oil that caused my blower to fail.
B0045G6KFO|4|Limited feel of controls, but kept me warm down to 40* in the sierras. Worth the price I paid for them but not much more.
B000C543YC|5|Item was received quickly and appears identical to the original control arm removed from the car.
B005G2R2XA|5|i installed mine back in dec and have about 5k on it. has increased my mpg and changed the sound of my car a bit. nonething extreme just enough to let you know it is there.
B00445L26S|5|I had been researching all-season mats for my 2006 Toyota Tundra Crew Cab for several months. In the past I had purchased heavy rubber OEM accessory mats from the dealer for my Honda Civic and Nissan Frontier. As with factory accessories, once a new generation of the vehicle goes in production the availability of factory accessories for the previous generation quickly disappears.<br />Finding custom fit, heavy duty, mud and snow trapping rubber mats in the aftermarket is difficult. There are many made from vinyl, but not rubber. Often they neither fit correctly nor will not stay in place.<br />When I opened the box and started removing the Catch-It mats, I immediately felt the discomfort of the raised spikes on the backside of the mat. The backside is an injection-molded plastic contoured to match the floorboard, and has spikes molded in to prevent the mat from slipping. The top side is a washable carpet with valleys and raised lip around the perimeter to trap dirt and liquid spills.<br />I installed the mats in a few minutes and the fit was very good. Part of the mat drapes down to meet the door sill. I don't know how much liquid the mats could hold in the case of a spill, but a small to medium coffee seems possible. The mats could probably hold more but the absorption rate of one mat could probably only handle 6-10 ounces per spill. As for mud and snow, these mats would work well because the injection-molded plastic backing would prevent melting snow and wet mud from escaping through the back of the mat.<br />Overall, I am very happy with these mats. Quality and fit are very good. The molded spikes in the bottom of the mat insure this mat will NOT move once in position. Unfortunately, Lund/Nifty does not offer a matching Catch-IT carpet mat for the rear seat floorboard of the crew cab model, only the extended cab model. I will have to order the vinyl Catch-It mat for my crew cab.
B001V8UKBY|5|After using my new trailer aid, it is the best product I have found in 20 years. Would definitely recommend it to fellow trailer owners.
B00KTJ807W|5|Excited about this product! Is of great quality and terrific price! I was able to program it in about 2 minutes. No need for a professional or dealer on this one, just as advertised. This product saved me almost $100 from the dealer's cost. This Key FOB arrived sooner than anticipated from the seller. I cannot tell this Key FOB from the original.
B00634WCRG|5|Looking forward to LED conversion on my car.
B003BQ5YW4|5|Great item thank you
B001O0HG20|5|These were just as I expected
B001KSAUYC|5|Bought these to replace the stock rear brake pads in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Unlimited. Perfect fit and braking definitely feels a lot better now. Very well priced especially after Wagner's $15 MIR (available on their website).
B000CGKQDI|5|Easy installation, holds my bike rack no problem.
B000KZ20HG|1|I have carefully followed the programming instructions several times and can't get the remote to work with my 2006 Toyota Solara Convertible.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|If you ride a motorcycle, this is a must have!
B00JAA9FRK|5|Product came fast and very durable and nice looking
B000FOL08M|5|Great product, but be careful not to stretch the sides of your truck bed. Be smart and use common sense.
B005S59EKY|5|Easy to install and worked great.  Took 10 minutes to install.
B001DRHMMS|5|Purchased this to replace what appears to be the original, manufacturer installed cabin filter in my BMW 3 series. Looks like the real thing (I do believe Mann is actually purchased and used by BMW as original equipment) and performs just as well! Excellent product!
B00OQ1G7BU|5|Stop the fan in my Mitsubishi Lancer 2005 from working continuously. Now it only comes on when the AC is on and when the engine is too hot.
B001QVRAW8|5|I should have listened to Bill's review, the 105 is to small. Love the product I'm going to order the 115, Amazon doesn't carry it. :(
B00BX5E11A|1|Plugged the lights and ballast in like they showed in the directions and changed out fuses but as soon as I turned the lights on the one turned on and the other did not.  Looked at the other one and the wire connected to the headlight was melted out like it could not accept the voltage.  there was not any support for the wires coming out of the headlight itself.  Wires needed to be wrapped in heat shrink tubing or something.  not pleased at all with them.
B003EP52BU|3|this is product is ok to buy if you know how XPEL Clear Universal Door Sill Guard (60&#34; x 2.75&#34;) Paint Protection Film...
B0006O2RV0|5|This blows the wheels off other air pressure gauges.  I'd put it up against the best of the best!
B00D10JXY0|3|Perfect fit! Perfect!
B00F3DP2KC|1|These are crap, REAL crap.  Micky Mouse wound not use them !  I bought them to replace a pair of Sears made ones that finally broke the cable after 10 years of heavy use.  These won't last a week !  They do not open without the use of two hands and do not hold the spring clamp well.  NOT GOOD !
B00IOYRF6G|5|Installation went well. Was able to do it right in my garage
B0016LG0CY|5|Perfect for what I needed. Also has a fuse integrated into it.  Great if you just need a pigtail for the power outlet.
B001PWA0IO|4|Got this for the grilfriend so she would stop slamming my tail gate down and shaking the whole truck. Well i guess it was for me then cause it irritates me not her. lol
B008LUULV4|1|Does nothing to to get rid of the smell and it also does nothing to really cover it up. I bought a 3 pack so the first time i just tried 1 the next time i used the other 2 it worked for a day.
B004ZG7TH2|5|This was my second cover by Ultragard. They're really good covers, and they protect your bike extremely well. Love the color as well. I even bought a matching cover for my Bushtec trailer. Only wish they'd make em waterproof.
B00681BE2S|5|Easy to program works perfect
B002R1OVKA|5|Matched the factory version and installed easily.
B00D50REQ0|5|Great the material was perfect the size is the right and also when you driving feel awesome, recommended no doubt
B0046KLUGS|5|Very easy to put together and lock to the roof rails. Nice and solid with no rattles or shakes and no movement at all after three weeks.
B006VXY8IK|4|As with any BMW part it's big money but looks nice and is functional. A little had to clean behind it.
B007A9UH7A|3|I bought one of these replay XD cameras (Non HD version) and attached it to my<br />race car which is a formula ford using the supplied swivel mount.<br />after viewing the video the quality was OK, I wasn't expecting great since I bought the non-HD version but the thing I did not like was the fact that the<br />video was wavy , not all the time but was pretty frequent. I think it may have<br />been due to the mount itself which allowed the camera to move around even when<br />it was set in the 'lock' position.  it also allowed the camera to rotate so after<br />a few minutes the video was more or less 90 degrees off. Had to turn the laptop<br />sideways to view the video.<br /> second time I used it it got worse as the mount itself broke off so the camera was lost, I contacted the company directly concerning the mount, initially I got<br />a reply stating the case was assigned and that someone will get back to me.<br />I was just asking them if there is a known defect in the mount itself since the<br />camera itself seems like a pretty good unit. That was the last I heard from them though but maybe they are still investigating.<br /> overall I do think the camera is good but whomever buys one should consider buying one of their 'solid mounts' which is made of aluminum I believe as<br />opposed to what came with the kit which is plastic.
B005DUQ6BY|5|Super bright..fite perfect in my 2008 tc nd is brighter then most H.I.D.s ..i am super impressed and i hands down recommend this item
B00KTIUOIQ|5|Worked great and found an automotive locksmith to cut it and program it for $75.00
B002UJ13QO|5|I probably took about 30min per lens and they came out very clear. I'm sure if I spent more time they would have been much clearer, but they removed all of the haziness from my car. I was actually able to use this to clear the lenses of my truck as well as my fathers and had enough to maybe do 1 more pair of lenses, but we had no more hazy lenses. Highly recommend. The instructions mention something about a protectant that could be sprayed/rubbed on afterwards to help minimize re-hazing, sort of a UV protectant.
B001AIZ5HY|5|The headlights were yellowing and hazy. It took a couple of hours, maybe three in total, but the lenses now appear as new. Just follow the instructions. It is best if you have a corded drill or two batteries if you have a cordless.
B00563OEKI|5|They look great and are priced reasonably.<br /><br />Although you will not notice much difference on your wheels, I will buy it again.
B00F0M2U6K|5|Love these on my Acadia. They were easy to install,
B005UTS6NE|5|Well built quality product! My girlfriend loves them on her civic! Very happy they are metal and not cheap plastic! Will be getting a set for my car, just not in pink! Lol!
B0051QNT6K|4|Haven't completed my V8 conversion project so have not put it use yet but test fit and quality shows its definitely worthy. Good bang for your buck!
B000CQOIQE|1|So short its worthless.  No way I could hook a trailer to it because it was too close to the bumper.  Not worth returning because by the time they deduct return shipping there's nothing left.  Will use as a paper weight or something in the garage.
B00139WO9C|4|Did the job and not too costly. Not heavy on features and not digital, but a bargain at the price.
B000CQBML8|5|Absolutely awesome!! Must have!!
B005MH4G2E|5|I'm s stroke survivor on blood thinners my feet freeze so easily. Not anymore!! These boots allowed me to be out in this winters arctic blast without any frostbite issues!!! Best boots ever!! Top quality!!!
B000QV0FCQ|1|These were written up to lead you think it was a complete strut assembly-the strut, coil spring, top mount, boot & bumper, already assembled and ready to install. The item arrived on time, but it WAS ONLY THE STRUT-no coil spring, no top mount, no boot, no bumper.<br />I returned them as &#34;not as described&#34;.  Amazon arranged for a quick UPS pickup at my house and I received a quick, full return with no shipping costs to me.<br />The product was not as described, but the service from Amazon was GREAT!! No hassle return!!
B0049YWQVY|5|very nice
B000FW2MCC|4|I really like this mirror-especially when doing makeup in the car (while parked!). It's clips are long enough to fit snugly over my Toyota Camry's visor and it is very lightweight. Wish it had a light though!
B001TNHFUK|5|Just what I needed!
B00JA68E6M|5|Fits like it is made by BMW...yet it is actually better design with raised edges, better material, better looking, and better priced than the factory one.
B002R09C6E|5|This is a perfect replacement for the rear driver light; comes with the light bulbs. It takes about 10-20 minutes to remove the old one and install the new one, but fits perfect. Had another driver back into my Xterra last week; Aside from a scratch on the bumper, the rear light was damaged beyond usage. When I found this I decided to give it a try as a replacement instead of filing a claim vs insurance and raising my rates. Now considering to order the passenger light because one light looks very old and this one is brand new. Shipped within one day of ordering.
B000CSEZ42|5|Work great on my 2 Kawasaki jet skis. I replace plugs every year and these have been great. Highly satisfied with product. Plan to keep purchasing.
B0087R141C|5|Awesome! Just what I needed straight nipples....
B00JU65OP6|3|Watch out if you have a vanity mirror like most in the center or your visor.  The big clip for this visor is also in the center.  Big problem there.
B002HG881I|5|Plug it in and forget it. Excellent buy. Never worry about charging again. Indicator lights tell the story. Everyone should own one of these.
B000C53XIE|5|Comes with both shocks
B005GLIPR8|5|these things are great!  they are white when the turn signal isn't on, and bright yellow when it is blinking.  they come with some zip ties, quick connects, load resistors, and some splice looking things that I am not entirely sure how to use....I didn't use any of these things and I simply bought a flasher designed for LED's...you might end up having to modify these to get them to fit, i did.  they are about as tall and wide as the stock replacements, but the base is more round and oval. I shaved some of it off to fit right in my connector, figure modifying these things is better than trying to modify the OEM connector....<br /><br />2004 Silverado
B000C5BM2I|5|Although difficult to install on my girlfriends Expedition, the rewards well out weighed the trouble !  It works great !
B00K4U38YQ|5|Won't stick not 3 M Tape as stated on product
B00AZPP0Y6|5|They help me finde my penis in the dark
B008JPODMY|5|Watched YouTube video after I received this part and a half hour later I was done. The part fit was EXACT.
B003JO2AAC|4|I had heard the Stebel was the best air horn out on the market, my bike mechanic said it was the one to get. So I ordered the Stebel and when it arrived I took it in the shipping box to my mechanic and he installed it.  A couple days later we were talking and we got on the horn subject and I said the Steble was nice. He told me I did not have a Stebel I had another brand. It works fine I just wish the seller would have informed me they were subsituting. I emailed them and got not response. So product good seller should be more attentive.
B009Y0I612|3|I might have missed the description stating that this bracket was plastic. It seems that it will do the job of holding the shower wand.  I should have checked the weight, and then I might have suspected it was plastic. The metal coating seems quite thick. I have not mounted it yet and will update as soon as I get it mounted.
B001AM8IT2|5|These were exactly what I needed to take the sag out of the springs on my 1977 Cherokee fsj.  Before installing these shocks the leaf springs sat flat, now they have a curve to them. I think it sits at least an inch higher (probably more, its very noticable) than with the old stock shocks. Installation is really simple as long as you get the wheels off of the ground to get the shocks fully  extended. New overload springs should also give even more new life to this old fsj suspension. ... A couple of things I forgot. These shocks fit on both the front and rear but the washers provided are too small to fit on the mounting studs. The washers/spacers aren't necessary on the rear, but you'll have to find some larger ones to get clearance  from the shock tower on the front.
B006FT90IS|5|This little tank bag is nearly perfect. Riding a BMW R1150RS, OR ANY Beemer with a weird shaped tank often comes with all kinds of silly recommendations to spend hundreds of dollars on overly complex tank bags that require semi permanent mods to your bike. For some models maybe that is all you can do, but I'm protective of my baby.  So I searched and fretted and found this perfect little match. The strap mount fits my bike perfectly, is solid on the tank at any speed and is easily taken on and off to pop into the store, or removed entirely whenever you like.<br /><br />It was pretty water resistant in the one rain storm I've been caught in, but clearly not ready to be soaked in a long haul.  I don't power through rain myself anyway, so didn't worry me.<br /><br />I love the little space that is intended for a GPS. I don't use it for that. Instead I put a little solar battery in there to give me some backup for my mobile phone on longer trips.<br /><br />I got the small one and fill it to the gills. Plenty of room for water bottle, keys, hat, wallet, flashlight, and what not. I wouldn't want a bigger one, I would fill it with too much crap. This one is perfect.
B000HBM80M|2|seems very course
B004KGCN8W|5|Absolutely love it! Was EXACTLY what I was looking for. Excellent quality product!
B000EFOZQG|5|Fits perfectly well.
B00AWWRKNG|5|Great Fit for my Ford F250. Stay in place and keep my carpet clean. The floor liners look nice and are easy to clean.
B0048DTA7Y|4|Really good quality mats, cut perfectly for my 2007 Kia Sportage. The only thing missing is the original &#34;Sportage&#34; wording, which I'm sure is too much to ask for a 3rd party product. Still, I'm happy with the purchase.
B0002SA460|2|I followed the direction and this top still fits loose on my 2004 Rubicon with factory door surrounds. The front two door surround clips have come undone on the freeway twice now with everything as tight as I can get it. My other two bestop bikinis have never had any issues with this. I'm packaging up to send back. Not sure if this was a bad batch or what. The seams and fabric seem ever better quality than my two older bikinis but I just tried my standard non safari top and it fits super snug. Weird to run into this with the best aftermarket soft top maker. I'm debating if I should order another one once I send this one back.
B00132JWDK|5|This was exactly what I wanted.  It was very easy to install.  I love it!  Would recommend this item, it was a good buy!
B0066QTXPU|1|Bought one - it failed after 6mos.  They replaced. Second one failed after a year.  Going to buy an OEM one.  Replacing it is such a pain that it is not worth the couple of bucks you save.  Good customers service as far a honoring their warranty. Stay away. YRMV.
B006NZTZLQ|4|The one I received was loose in the package and the package may have been opened.  It also rattles - something loose inside.  I will not risk a short by plugging it in.  I will be returning it.  Sad, I was looking forward to trying it.<br /><br />Amazon replaced this item in a very short time.  The replacement works, talks to the Torque app on my S4.  I've gone from 1 to 3 stars.<br /><br />I'd like to leave it plugged in, but I am concerned about the power usage.  I left it plugged in about 6 hours, and when I examined it the power light was still on.  The web site for the product does not indicate how to determine the device is powered down, or I missed the reference.  Will update.<br /><br />Update: ScanTool has left a comment regarding my concerns with power.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|This is a great sun shade!  It fits nicely in my 2011 Toyota Camry.  Very easy to put up and take down.  I don't bother folding it and putting it back in the bag.  I just fold it in half and throw it in the back seat.  When I'm ready to get out of my car, I can grab it, open it up and put it on the windshield in 5 seconds.  Its nice that it has the extra fabric around the edges to cover the corners of the windows.
B000UD0CTQ|4|umm. It worked for the oil change. Have not named it or talk to it or tuck it at bedtime ... just used it... and as mentioned it worked.<br />Rather not write an essay for the feed back.<br />It worked
B001N4QY66|5|Worked great.
B003IOKPLO|5|the best sellr<br />this item good
B002N5YDG2|5|With the extreme heat this summer our RV refrigerator was running on the warm side.  We installed this fan and it is now being maintained at the proper temperature.  No more worries.
B00UHD4HJA|1|Absolutely crap.  Talk about bs stickers. 3 skateboarding stickers and the rest including Homer Simpson, YouTube, Skype, and bunch of crap stickers that has nothing to do with skateboarding/snowboarding/surfing.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this horrible sticker set.<br /><br />Oh and to add injury to insult is that they only shipped half of what I ordered.  Also the shipment came from China. Enough said right there.  Don't buy!!!
B000CNBAWM|5|I live in southwest Florida and soon realized that this bug shield was a necessity after our \\"love bug\\" season commenced in late April.  I ordered this product, which is of good, solid quality, and installed it with no difficulty.  While it doesn't totally eliminate bug splatter, it does make a huge difference in how much of it I get on the windshield.  I wouldn't drive a truck without one now that I know what they can do for visibility!
B004FFHFW2|5|I bought this for my Ford F150 and it works very well.  The F150 has the oil drain hole on the side of the pan making the oil shoot out.  This valve has a short nipple on it that you can put a hose on to direct the oil into a pan or bottle.  The valve itself is good quality and has a safety mechanism to avoid unintentional opening. Messy oil changes are a thing of the past!
B00JDPYXM4|5|Works Fantabulous!!
B000FTLHVC|5|A unique and hard to find lamp housing that uses H3 bulbs.  If you're going to mod your ride, you might as well put a little more effort into it than simply bolting on a couple of 55W bulbs.  Your car comes with 55W bulbs in the headlamps, so this is not much of an upgrade.  A lot of people don't even know how to aim these lights.  However, if you take the time to take the light housing apart, you can replace those lackluster 55W bulbs with any H3 bulb you want.  With 100W or 130W bulbs, aimed properly, you now have the ability to light up the night.

B0033QNZZ0|5|Knowing the different types of coolant is a must the days. Some have silicates and some don't, some are organic or hybrid while others are not. This G05 spec coolant is MB approved which is not easy to find everywhere. If needed, buy from Amazon for a great price and quick shipping.
B00BG4QRHE|5|The jacket fits great.  Lots of pockets to carry things while on the slopes or just walking around.  Price was fantastic!  If you wear a 2XL, this jacket fits to 2XL
B003ATCLYG|5|I recently bought a boat and needed a trailer hitch to pull it. I saw this trailer hitch and you can't beat the price anywhere else. It's easy to install, I just grabbed a small piece of carpet it and slid it under my Suzuki. I did run into one problem though. My Suzuki didn't have the towing hooks so the threads on the bolts were rusted and the bolts wouldn't go in. I would check the condition of the threads before ordering. If they look bad order a thread tap that is 12mm x 1.25. I had to order one because all the stores I went to did not carry the 1.25 pitch for a 12mm tap. Once your threads are clean just slide under the vehicle. Adjust the hitch where you want it and place one bolt on one side about half way in and place another bolt on the other side about half way in just to hold it. The bolts will need a 19mm socket. You will need a long extension for the passenger side because the muffler tip gets in the way. On the driver side a 19mm ratchet wrench will fit allot better. If you don't have a 19mm socket or wrench you can get by by using a 3/4\\" socket or wrench.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|works great an more compact
B00332GMIQ|5|Direct fit, no alteration required whatsoever! They double stick tape used to hold them on is very strong and have had no problems so far.
B0051W6AW4|5|Live in vegas no loss of reception, well worth the price.
B0048ECNR2|4|The mats aren't perfect for our 2010 Odyssey but close enough and much less than the ones from Honda were.
B005MVBENO|5|This tool did exactly what I needed it to do. I have a 2003 Ford F150 4.6L truck. I had to replace my radiator and found out to remove it properly needed a special tool to remove the two transmission cooler lines from my old radiator. I slid the 3/8&#34; side into the groove, did a twist and pulled on the cooler line and it popped right out. Do not unscrew connector from the radiator. Using this tool makes it all much easier.
B000C81JAU|5|This is the exact piece that I needed. Fit exactly and worked like a charm on the first try. Thanks!
B004052AEK|5|Item as described and expected,  greattach quality
B00CFBSOAU|5|Perfect fit, shipped in time to go to my ride, alot smoother acceleration love this belt! Will be buying an extra soon just in case!
B00F0MBAAW|4|Good finish installed on my 2012 4door Frontier easily. Would be nice if nuts were aircraft locking type or thin star lock washers provided as Nissan factory mounting studs were not long enough to accommodate both the included flat washer and split type lock washer - few years underbody though will probably make the nuts as 'locked' as they need to be. Also be nice if outward most bar holding bolts were hidden from side view - maybe a front edge to the holding bracket.
B0028N8DGU|5|These work with the Stans NoTubes insert.
B001GRN8A0|5|My husband has had a set of these floormats for his Land Rover for over a year and they have held up really well.  I decided to order a set for my C-Class and similar to the Land Rover, they fit perfectly and even had snaps to fit perfectly to those equipped in the car.  Great product.
B001B7RS4M|5|Though I didn't like drilling into my truck to install it things went rather well. Great box for the money. Keep things organized.
B0026PGN3A|1|This tire cover did not well at all.  It should probably state more clearly the actual model year Rav 4 that it actually is made for.  It did not fit a 2011 Rav 4.  Be sure you measure carefully.  Also, the only way to cinch it is to tie the cord in a knot so once you put it on its not coming off.
B007N69IRA|4|This was a give to my son and he is happy with the results it gives for the job in painting.
B000WJYMMQ|5|Product fit my bike and my needs. My saddle bags cover the original equipment helmet lock so this one provides me a much needed alternate.
B006NSN7OE|5|loved the sticker
B004UPZVSC|5|Works great can plug everything in if needed. Monitors car's charge as a plus. Seems durable and fits perfect in cup holder
B004ZF3JJA|4|So far it's going good. I've had them for only two days though. Waiting for something to go wrong, like these reviews of bad ballasts. Have three sets of hids so hopefully I didn't blow $300 on these. Fml. Will update when something s*** out.
B004I0FZFS|4|excellent
B00D9H0UT2|5|This bracket is exactly as pictured.  I would have preferred more description, but it was OK.  It arrived within a few days of ordering.
B00F5QMNW2|1|I ordered the 9007 bi xenon ( hi and low beam) 5000k kit, shipping was fast, but the product unfortunately was crap. Upon initial installation, the factory retaining rings to hold the bulb WILL NOT fit over the HID conversion bulb/solenoid, I assume the 9004 is the same ring as a 9007. I kinda got the bulb to stay on place with some crafty engineering, then tested the install. then bulbs instantly flickered like they were having seizures and one was white, one was kinda blue. Now onto the high beam... flip my switch.. NOTHING happens... thats ok, maybe its wired for a 9004 harness, as the directions imply. I get out the test light and voltmeter, check continuity of my factory harness to find which color wire does what... flip the wires around on the HID conversion harness and check functionality again.. Now when i hit the high beam switch, the lights shut off. NICE. Bottom line, do not waste your money, time or effort on this kit, and test your luck elsewhere.
B00DDZWAZW|5|Very high quality product and included all tools to make installation a breeze.  I never disassembled an iPhone before, but after watching the youtube video and using included tools, I replaced battery and had unit back together in 10 mins.  battery was marked identically to original apple battery, and after 4 months of operation I can say it performs equal to a brand new OEM battery.
B002L9D6YK|3|Okay if you can get your fingers in the hub cap covers to put them on.
B000JFJLP6|1|It says to recharge every 90 days if you haven't used it... When I pulled it out of my trunk two weeks before 90 days was up the thing was completely dead and won't recharge.  I followed the instructions for charging the first time upon receiving it.  I guess I should have checked it periodically but when they tell you every 90 days then I had no reason to doubt the instructions.
B000P6UNMY|4|Works as expected. OTC is a very reputable tool company that I have other tools from. It got four stars just because of how expensive it was. I found after the fact a spreader that was over $100 less (from East Coast Gear Supply I think) or if you felt like cheating you can weld you own from this design and return it.
B0007VZ5B6|5|If you have a lot of cars to find leaks on this is what you need.
B007HRYHDA|1|Have used for about 6 months and the lens is already cracked about halfway across. Very cheap product.
B00EZ85W7O|4|Ordered these because of great price shipping was fast and item was exactly as shown perfect fit easy install there was no alcohol cleaning pads so just make sure you have some around
B00JH8UXC6|5|Applied to my 1990 Chevy K1500. 5 stars!!!!!! These light are awesome. Plastic is a little thin, but don't really care. The look incredible. Super bright.
B001EOWQRQ|5|Well made and finish is good. Fits in receiver perfectly.
B002PYCUCK|5|Works exactly as it should and super easy to install. Can feel the hook up in the back end especially because most of my riding is in one of the Great Lakes it definitely helps in the choppy water.
B000CM2UB8|5|Perfect replacement, works great, very good purchase!
B000CB3ZY0|1|Not even close to fitting my vehicle even though Amazon said it would.  Lookup the part on the Mann Filter website and cross check before you order.
B006CSSKCO|5|I would buy this again. Purchased it for a Clarion NX702. Instructions were easy, almost self explanatory. Stereo works flawlessly while in motion, however I STRONGLY discourage doing so. It's very distracting.
B00EKS5GDY|5|The color is so original and unlike other gunmnetals, charcoals,  or matte black. When glossifier is added you have something special!.
B00FP2CV2I|5|Arrived fast. Looks great on my car. I'm proud to display it.  Thanks
B00JIIZCM6|5|Best product I've ever used
B0009Y8WIY|5|This was a great kit compared to the K&N kit I replaced it with. Fitment was much better than my last kit.
B006OUNLAG|5|Installed this afternoon behind glove box door and works fine in 2012 Kia Sportage. What else is there to say?
B005NLQAHS|5|Works better than expected. Syncs up to my Droid in about 10 seconds. I use Torque app (free) and spent about 15 minutes setting up a dashboard and it's good to go. I carry it with me all the time to check sensors and REALTIME data even while I'm driving. I can read and clear codes and reset check engine light.<br /><br />This thing is INVALUABLE!
B001PYU758|5|perfect fit
B0051SEKLQ|5|My first test was on the wife's KTM 85 SX. It fit!<br />Worked well on a 15 minute trip, even in the rain & mud covered tire on the way back.<br />Much more stable with one of these!
B000FW61SI|2|While I liked the idea of being able to flip down a glare reducer and while the panel on this product does an adequate job of reducing glare and is overall unflawed the product execution is flawed to the point of impracticality. When attached as instructed (to the visor top) it is entirely redundant, offering no enhancement to the functionality of the standard visor; worse, it impedes the otherwise easy unlatching of the visor that lets it swing to cover the side window. When the instructions are ignored and it is attached to the visor bottom where it might offer extended glare reduction its unchangeable clip positions collide with the visor's built-in mirror. With little benefit to the driver this is not a pragmatic expenditure. Bell: widen the clip spacing and alter the instructions to dramatically improve the buyer's return on investment in this product.
B00508MXUC|5|They look cheaply built. They cost very little. But, they do what they are supposed to do. What more can you ask from these lights.
B007BXCNX6|4|I use 15,000 mile oil, but change it at around 5,000 miles because I have not previously been able to purchase a long-life filter.  My mechanic who changes the oil looked at this filter and told me why he found it better than the ones I previously bought.  I have an '09 Sienna and it fits.<br /><br />Con:  Seems pretty overpriced to me.
B007IVS93Y|2|These Are Extremely Wobbly.
B000VL024C|4|This was a little challenging to install, but it fit our 2010 VW Passat and saved us quite a bit over having the mechanic install one for us.
B000BTK9V0|4|You cant go wrong with these Bear Claws. I used them on a custom truck build and  they are beefy, well made, and latch tightly. Highly Rec'd
B0047MAPFM|3|It works well, I do have a little trouble with the auto up down feature on the drivers window. Many times it can't be stopped, this was described in other reviews. Also, it works with the drivers side window even when the ignition is completely off, unlike the original switch.
B004QKLSO2|5|Heavy duty
B0011FLODA|5|Works perfectly and the ergonomic grip makes it easy to plug and unplug.
B0016IV8R4|5|Great product, dropped right in with no problems in my wives 2006 Sierra pick up.
B000CQTSO6|5|Quiet and easy to install. Fits 2007 Hyundai Tucson.  I added high temp brake grease to back of each as well as the new clips where they meet the pads no noise at all.
B004GFTC0E|4|This worked really well, only problem I had is I thought the kit would be enough for both headlights on my Dodge Ram, but it was really only enough for one headlight.  I think it would have worked if my headlights were only discolored, but they also had some small cracks that require more sanding.
B000COTKDM|4|I just ordered this unit to use inside my garage to hoist up a utility trailer that I want to stand on end to make more room.  I needed to buy an ac to dc converter to power it and the specs do not state the current draw.  I called Master lock and they told me 4 to 6 amps for a several hundred pound load - and 20 amps at the maximum 2000 pound load.  That is a lot of current so make sure your adapter and/or car outlet can supply the current needed.      I will post back once I have had a chance to use it.
B0076ATZJE|5|some jerks stole my antenna when i left my car parked at a bar parking lot and took a taxi. Who would have known that people at bars would wanna mess with your antenna..lol...oh well...so looked around for a long time. But i finally found this one for cheap...Well worth it...does exactly what its supposed to do....and i actually forgot all about them stealing my antenna till i ran into my old product reviews....Get it youll be satisfied...Its exactly like the original...oem status for sure...but not expensive like the real oem at the lot...lol...they are like 100 ....screw those guys.
B00BQE5IKG|4|The wires are a bit short, but otherwise a good buy.
B004OOJ9RI|4|Used it to scan an airbag code. Worked fine for that. Have not used it for anything else yet, but will when need arises
B000EDOSS8|4|ok
B00GSHBAX0|5|These really hold firmly to the carpet in your cargo area.
B00141KZO0|4|I got these Wiper Blades for my Jetta TDI (2010) and the fit perfectly. It took me about a minute to install them in the dark. Tested them out and the clean the window pretty well.
B00A2B39PA|5|great kit easy to install
B00MBPLPOC|4|I applied the kit two weeks ago and my tires are still shining.  Two weeks are not much but I live in Chicago and it has rained every other day.  In spite of all the rain, the tires have maintained a great gloss.  I read a lot of reviews stating that the smell is terrible.  The smell did not really bother me.  I applied this in my garage and kept the garage door open.  Just make sure to stay ventilated and use the gloves provided in the kit.
B00OSOPMGQ|5|Great led bulbs, very bright, white. Compares to my friends BMW 550 M package. Worth every penny.
B007TW8I2O|5|Exactly as expected. Good quality
B003ATB7FU|4|Works good but like someone else stated in a review before I bought it you will need 2 bolts I think they were 2 1/4 long & 2 spacers that were not in the kit to mount the front rail.
B003GAQ2VM|5|Worked perfectly.
B000CFO05E|3|great product. had to contact air lift since gauge didnt work. Had to give them deposit so they could send replacement.  Excellent customer service and tech support.  cant wait to get replacement gauge. would have been 5 stars but due to bad gauge which almost cost me over inflating my bags i could only give 3 stars
B00ZF9ZUVA|3|Wasnt the right door handle
B0009OR96A|3|After reading the reviews on these wrenchs, chose this one cause most said it worked.<br />Well changed the oil on the Tundra and guess what, to big, slipped on the cap.<br />So what do you do when your under your truck with no oil in it? Can't send it back, can't go Auto Zone?<br />Its slipping so ya Duck Tape it! Lined the inside of wrench with a strip of tape and it worked like a champ!
B000COSSDK|1|Showed up broken had to pay shipping to get it replaced
B000C5E4XM|5|Good: Perfect fit, easy install once I figured out how to pop the old one off. :)<br /><br />Bad: Nothing significant.<br /><br />Bottom line: Perfect replacement for the OEM wiper arm.  Five stars.
B001GJ3DZS|4|I bought this brush to use with some couch foam cleanser, to massage the foam into the fabric.  It works fine, but I only use a tiny corner of the brush to do the job.  It would take a pretty huge stain to warrant using the entire brush (which I believe is actually a car product).  Even so, the bristles are gentle and soft. I'd recommend this product.
B002P8CIIW|5|Mirror fit perfectly
B000UUMM6K|5|Easy to install. Took approx 20 minutes. Well made
B007Q8H3UY|5|Fits very well and pretty rugged.  Seats have to be permanently positioned pretty far back, but there was still room for someone in the third row.
B0083CXUWC|5|They work great at half the price locally.
B005RF6G4M|5|It allows zero sun light to get through on to the Camry dash.<br /><br />It's a wee bit stiff, but solid.
B00144BIC0|4|After 3 weeks, three of the LEDs went out, really disappointing. It's a great light bar, easy to install, bright, and looks good, but none of the LEDs should have went out in three weeks... Hopefully I won't have as much trouble with their support as others have.<br /><br />Will update my review with how support goes.<br /><br />UPDATE: Checked on my previous lights and those 3 lights that went out, came back a week ago. Another week later, they're out again. Not sure what's happening with them but oh well, replacement came in and will be swapping the two out soon. Didn't have any trouble with getting my replacement light bar either, it was actually really easy and they shipped a replacement immediately. But I didn't have to go through Rampage, I went through the replacement process with Amazon.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: 8/4/2014<br /><br />Replacement has been working perfect for the past 7-8 months! No burnt out LEDs or any problems this time around. Great product and support!
B0002SRH5G|5|As far as evacuating air from a coolant system, and refilling it, this is the greatest invention since the funnel.  I LOVE this tool, for its fast and easy to use combination of super high quality construction, and myriad of fittings for any car I've come across. Saves SO much time, mess, aggravation, assures no air, while checking for leaks before you add the coolant, and has a carrying case to boot! Must have a comressor with a storage tank. Only thing lacking from instructions is to remind you to clean the whole thing after use with clean water and let dry. A home mechanic &#34;must have&#34;, especially for water cooled Porsche owners.
B002OP79S0|3|The problem is, the stock springs needed to be bent to a different angle before they'd line up with the retaining hole on the bike. I had to use jumbo channelock type pliers to compress the spring and at the same time use needle nose pliers to fit the angled end of the spring into the above hole. Had to drill out the holes for the pivot pegs too before they'd fit.  They are much more comfortable than the stock Suzuki pegs.
B00JMLB4TY|5|Great stuff have used for years glad to find it here
B00551DZ3S|5|Easy to assemble and works great!
B00282ETBY|5|we are a auto refinishing shop bought this for a second back up buffer it works as well or better than a high dollor tool we did however put a lager Velcro finishing weal on the on that coms with it is to small and has hard edges that could damage a finsh if your not carfull
B0012H6HMK|3|This is a product that is over priced for the way it is made. That being said it is a neat product. If one bulb is burned out none will work so you have to search each one to find which is not working. First time use had to replace a bulb.
B007WISFC8|5|Great sticker
B003V0GG18|5|most excellent trash bag for my 2006 Dodge Stratus!!
B00HJK8DPI|5|Just what I wanted.
B00GXPQAWI|5|The light this bulbs produces is bright and crisp. I do not feel the heat that a stock bulb would normally emit. Just make sure you get the right length (31mm is usually standard dome light size). I have install this bulb in all four of my cars. They are worth the money without the worry.
B000XTHUHE|3|Did not work any better than the original (On a Toyota Yaris). I suspect the wiper arm is the issue, not the blade itself.
B002WV7UD0|5|These go in easy and work perfectly every time.
B00AOIM2CC|5|I bought this for my '98 Corolla, so I could diagnose any problems I might be able to address myself. Though the packaging and manual left much to be desired (poor packaging, no manual),  I soon figured out what to do using google and Amazon reviews :)<br /><br />This unit requires a password: &#34;12345678&#34;. Once connected, download an OBDII compatible app (I picked Dash Command). The app should require little to no configuration if you're connected to the unit's wifi network. Then just customize the app to you needs, and voila! Now my old car with almost no features can calculate gas mileage, tell me when there are sensor issues, and more!<br /><br />The only real downsides to this unit are in the wifi protocol itself:<br />-Latency: This unit has a bit of a delay to it. It's only really noticeable if you're watching your RPM on your phone and on the tachometer at the same time<br />-Wifi connection: If you're connected to this unit, you can't get any sort of wifi internet. Not a problem for me, but may be for some. If so, get an expensive wired one :/
B000KL3DYE|1|This is NOT for 1999-2004 Xterra! The fitment information is incorrect! This only fits 2005-2015 Xterra Models!
B001C0044O|5|I purchased this top as a gift for my nephew. He absolutely loves it! Item arrived on time, in proper size and was a bit hit!
B00029WYEY|5|Still on the same bottle so its time to reorder
B000C546OY|1|The item is not a natural metal color as in the picture, it is painted black. Most disappointingly there is no grease fitting which was my number one criteria and why I chose the Moog BJ even though their reputation is going south. I partly blame myself since the description does not indicate there is one, but the PICTURE...Anyway, I hope it will hold up, I am in a pinch now and need to get this job completed.
B000GU7VM4|5|I replaced the stock OEM bearings with the All Balls units and noticed an immediate difference.
B006FYI5WU|3|Worked for a bit...then didnt.
B008SEBQ2G|5|Its short, discrete and doesn't bang around in the car wash. I only use satellite radio so I don't care and don't know how good it is for AM/FM. Looks slick on my black on black 2014 Ram
B001LHVOVK|5|Arrived quickly.  Price low, performs well, solved the engine light problem and diagnosed the problem.  Not a problem at all to look the code up once this device provides.
B004UI1WE6|5|It was a fast delivery and I was very satisfied with the logo on the caps nd the anti theft part is good I kept getting them stolen its a great buy would recommend
B007QHQB3U|5|Works as planned.
B003O9XX7G|5|love it
B003XNGLJU|2|I hit a deer on I-5 in Oregon. Totaled my Honda. Bought this whistle. Very little investment for a chance of safety. In one week after installing this device on my trucks grill, I passed 2 herd of deer grazing alongside the canyon road. In neither case did the deer even appear to notice me or react in anyway....&#34;JUST SAYING&#34;
B00MHQ93QC|5|Look nica on my honda civic 92
B00IX26X12|5|Tricky install. But well worth the price and the labor involved. Much better bracket than the stock ones that most light bars come with.
B00FRHOLK6|4|Perfect
B005L9EEHU|5|The product does exactly as it promises, and certainly exceeded my expectations. I have applied this can of Sno-Seal to a pair of brown knee-high boots and a pair of black ankle-high boots. I am quite happy with the results. Plus, I still have so much of it left! I could probably keep this can for years.  My brown boots barely had a finish on them. I applied once after heating with a hair dryer, and after drying applied another coat to get all the spots and cracks I might have missed. It did darken the leather, but it's made them last much longer than if I hadn't applied Sno-Seal! The black boots had a decent waterproof finish on them when I bought them, but after walking through various Rochester snow puddles and salty roads, it started to wear down at the toe. I applied Sno-Seal on top of the regular finish and they absorbed a surprising amount. These boots will last so much longer in the snow. I'm not worried at all about ruining the leather now, except if the snow gets inside my shoe...
B0002MBBIQ|4|Holds my 4 wheeler well!
B001U2D6OO|5|works freat
B003U6JHQY|5|Love it. My wife thinks it's a little too loud when I romp on it, I think it's perfect. I personally had a little bit of difficultly getting the piece in that connected to to turbo. The guide rod needed to be bent a little bit more, can't fault anyone for that. After I got the first piece in, the remainder took 20 mins. Total install time, for me, was about an hour and a half. I have an 06 Cummins Dually with a quad cab. No trimming needed fit perfectly. I would and have highly recommended.
B00N6D7K38|4|I replaced the halogen lights in my 2013 Toyota Rav-4 with these to give my vehicle a more expensive look. When I plugged the bulb into the socket, it was very bright especially from the two LEDs at the end of the bulb. However, when I placed the bulb inside of the headlight, it was significantly dull!<br /><br />When I took a closer look, I realised that the design of my headlight was where the bulb would be fitted facing perpendicular to the headlamp's opening, which results in dimmer side LEDs becoming the main source of light.<br /><br />When considering these lights, please check to see how your headlights orient their bulbs. If they had the bulbs facing towards the opening, then these will work very well for you. If they are oriented to the side, then these bulbs will only give you the derivative of nice daytime lights.<br /><br />As my problem with these bulbs are not a performance problem but rather a compatability issue, I will give these a 4/5. Despite the issue of bulb orientation, I do think that an equal amount of light should be coming from all LEDs on the bulb. Reading other reviews, this has been an issues for a lot of other buyers and has caused these bulbs to limit their customer pool.
B001B5MC4A|4|Love it so far. Just had it installed after our clutch went out on our Mazda 6. A few people were worried that going from a dual mass flywheel to single mass we might have loud chatter but it is as quiet as a mouse. Really made the car fun to drive again. Will upgrade to 5 stars once I am able to grade durability.
B001TQMZWU|5|Love this rocker, it travels well and allows comfort everywhere I use it.
B001TEPERK|4|looks great and fit pretty good. could have had a little bit better washers. they're a very thin nylon/rubber and bend too easily, but no issues. would of been better if they had been regular plastic, or even stainless. either way, worth the buy.
B0072W2VC4|5|works as expected
B00NON2332|5|I love this thing it not only helps me mount my headlight. I also found a way to get my mirrors to mount on this too. So my naked bike will be legal.
B000E6LEIC|4|The powerpack delivers but it promises. Portable power, both DC and AC. Trickle charger and the light work well. I haven't had any problems with my unit yet but the radio definitely needs improvement. Although it has a digital tuner, adjacent stations seem to overlap. Also the speaker is very small.
B00D329SCS|5|Very Good ..
B005GHB5U6|3|Cheap quality period but okay for the price
B001AJH1HK|5|This work great,  easy to put on and you can see all around.
B005IGTEIA|5|Thank you. Cargo arrived six days into turkey, really fast. Package included only plexiglass windshield, bracket and chrome parts not included and behind glass thin plexi part :)
B009WDZV2S|4|The frame does not increase the look of the vehicle alone. From far, it looks like all other license plate frame. However, if you insert a black aluminum BMW license plate along with the frame, the vehicle will significantly look aggressive. Recommend buying the plate!
B000CB3X4W|4|THANK
B00375JBL4|3|It helped a bunch, but I just expected my keyboard to be a whole new level of clean, and it really just did a regular kind of job.
B001D9TERM|5|aok
B00390NZHI|4|Look great, but hard to install drivers side. Some pump or something is in the way. They do look good when done.
B0009TO4FE|4|Nice bracket wish mine came with 21 micron filter instead of a 10
B00295T6V8|4|Arrive earlier than expected.  Color is great!  Thanks
B001QLCW30|5|Used to have Kuryakyn ISO with a stirrup, but can't find what I had on the old bike and didn't like the newer option.  The instructions are perhaps more complicated than needed and it's weird having to tighten everything down rather than just plug-play and make adjustments, but that's perhaps just me - I still rate it 5 stars because it was very easy to do and these are nice and stable and stronger than they look...  Very comfortable and were easy to replace on my harley offset mounts.
B000LY9E66|5|Westin has always produced a great product!  These bars are great for getting in and out of your truck!  Love It
B000EFCPOK|1|Suede particle residue left on vehicle during first use.  Also, holes began to form.  I believe this is a manufactured leather product.  Suede feel on both sides of Chamois.
B00PCRQWKI|5|High quality product. Fast shipment.
B005JVNQPQ|4|I didn't see the rust completely disappear, but it did arrest it and it painted over very nicely. Of course, I put a good soaking of 5% acidic acid (Vinegar) on it just 24 hours before painting it. All I can say is that I have a second carport pipe to paint and I'm going to do it the same as the first one, because it turned out spectacular!
B0051ZXGMS|5|Follows ISO standards. $15 cheaper than 5 quarts from my local shop. My car only uses 4.5 quarts. Great deal. Will buy again in the future.
B004K9BIY4|5|This item is great  It is beautifully finished and certainly works.  I'm very happy with it.
B0051D3MP6|3|I had another battery tender but that was given away and so I decided to purchase this one. It works; but it does take a little longer to charge. The connection points also appears to be extremely loose and so you have to keep an eye out. I think they need to make the connection point a lock mechanism and if I had to do it over I would of gone back with the other brand I had. One good note is that this does not overheat but it does take longer for the tender.
B00DCRGWHS|5|These are easy to attach and add a lot of fun to the look of my mini
B00XZ78W3C|5|This rack worked great on my vehicle and I would expect it to on any vehicle that meets the racks length.  I attached the rubber cord to prevent noise and I had no issues with excess noise or whistles.  It was very sturdy attached to the existing roof racks.  I would recommend this product.
B003VCB9WC|5|👍
B0021T5VUC|5|Very good!
B000CITK8S|5|Small and compact and seems to be keeping the batteries in my race cars charged up and ready for spring.  The extra long leads make reaching the battery easy and secure.
B001ABORQ6|4|Quick delivery, easy install. Flows more air than stock paper filter. Re-usable dry element filter means no &#34;filter recharge kit&#34;, just wash with water and light laundry soap and you're back in business.
B0009V1WS4|5|Quality product, well made, two sizes are helpful and reduced the chance of buying the wrong one.
B000YCDUVU|5|I purchased my first set of WeatherTech floor liners in 2008 and now I put them in all my vehicles right away. I live in Minnesota and our winters are really hard on the interior floors of our vehicles, but these floor liners protect everything, stay in place, and are easy to clean in the spring. I simply remove them and soap them up, scrub the entire mat with a brush and then rinse them off with a sprayer and let them dry. Wonderful!
B001UMZ07A|5|I LOVE this product!  It does EVERYTHING it promises to do!<br /><br />I own a 2002 back car here in NY and our winters are brutal with all the salt, and contruction in the summer, LOTS of &#34;dings&#34; and scrapes in the parking lots.<br /><br />Tutle wax black box made my car look like  it just came out of the showroom!! i have had many compliments on my cars' wax job which looks like mirror glass.....I LOVE IT!!<br /><br />Black box is a 4 step EASY treatment system. Wash and dry your car first.<br />Directions are very easy to follow.<br />ONLY issue I had, and it is NOT major, is that there in only a couple wipes, towels to use to remove the detail spray you have to use after you apply the pre-wax wash, then again after you apply the black box wax and use the detail spray to wipe it off, then you buff the wax.<br /><br />FILLS IN SCRATCHES AND THOSE &#34;dings&#34;<br />I couldn't believe it!!!!  It looks like new!!!<br /><br />Just don't get ahead of yourself applying the steps...you will WANT to when you see how AWESOME  your car looks BUT FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. I also used old, soft socks to remove the detailing spray both after the prewax wash and after applying the  wax.<br /><br />WEAR GLOVES...........Your hands will be covered in black and only use socks, t-shirts or any other soft cloths that you plan to throw out.....they WILL be completly black  BUT SO IS YOUR CAR!!!!  WELL WORTH throwing out some old, holey socks to have a beautiful, shiney, no marked up, mirror glass waxed car..... I LOVE what black box did to my car and I will buy it over and over again as long as I own a black car!!!<br /><br />Jan  in upstate NY
B004A5531C|2|Although this appears to be a quality product, the quantity of parts supplied is a bit odd. Each rear wheel requires two M clips and two of those other pointy-looking clips. This package inexplicably contains one wheel's worth of M clips and enough pointy-looking clips for both wheels. So, I am ordering a second helping to complete the passenger side. I supppse that its nice to have some spare parts in case some get lost or whatever. The good news is that after installing on my '90, the rattley, clanky noise is gone-from one wheel.
B000BQMGTG|4|Works great for shoveling snow off the windshield of my F150 without getting covered in snow.
B001LNUK7S|5|Special gift for Father's day, my father and his friends stay happy just want something.
B005FKSA0M|1|Bad. Lasted 2 mos and warped.
B00BGSF8XE|5|Good stuff.
B000C9KUAY|5|When I opened my package today which arrived 5 days ahead of schedule.....I was EXTREMELY pleased to see that this starter was actually built here in the good old USA.....not made in Mexico or China.....keep up the good work Amazon!.....Products manufactured here in the USA create jobs for Americans....who will then have the ability to purchase more products from Amazon!
B008P8FC4I|5|Good value
B000EVYGZA|5|Best for the money. Measures fast and quite accurate.  Good for home use.
B0018EZ9VC|5|Priced right and fits great on my 01 Soft tail. Compared to the Harley brand bags, this is a deal.
B00K5D30IG|5|Exact replica of the front badge, but not as long as the hood for the new 2015 badge.  This is going on my trunk to replace the flying H.  Will be a simple mod and looking forward to getting it on!
B003ZUFZXO|5|The EAGLE EYES PAIR PARK LIGHT LAMP were deliverd in the time indicated and were a direct fit, can not see the differnce from the factory original. I am very happy with the end results.
B000BYGJC8|1|These where about 2 inches too short.
B008J151H4|5|This is a super loud replacement for your original factory horn. It's actually much louder. The Wolo 619 puts out a deep single tone that sounds somewhat like the horns on a big rig. It really gets the attention of those jerks on their cell phones! The horn is very easy to mount using the supplied bolt, nut and washer. The on-line wiring instructions say that you simply plug the 2 wires from your original horn into this horn and you're done. This may be true for cars and truck but you WILL need to use a 30A relay for a motorcycle application. If you don't, you may blow out a fuse. I ordered a relay from Amazon when I ordered the horn.<br />Here are some additional items you'll need for use on a motorcycle. 1) An in-line 30A fusable link. You can pick this item up at an auto parts store or on Amazon. Make sure to get a couple of 30A fuses as they don't come with the fusable link.  2) Some extra electric wire in the same gauge that feeds your existing factory horn. 3) Some push-on male/female electric connectors to accomidate the relay and the fusable link. The instructions that come with the horn will walk you through this process. I have already had to use it a few times and I'm very happy with the performance of the horn.
B009XQ5VZQ|5|What you see is what you get!  This is the OEM part. An exact replacement for my 2010 Toyota Prius.  When you first receive the hubcap be sure and notice that it will only look &#34;correct&#34; when mounted on the wheel.  This is because the factory steel wheel can be seen through the openings on the cap yet it looks to be one unit.  Anyway, put the cap on and it will match exactly as described.  Good job Amazon.
B00AZOJB2O|5|The Subaru Legacy Sedan is a lot lower than the Outback - these clips are a must if you are a DIY or if you noticed that you have pull or broken a few clips under the vehicle that hold the many rubber parts around the wheels.  For the price... is a must have just in case!
B0060JYDGC|1|These do not fit S-MX 5 boots
B004NKYJ9G|5|Exact fit for 2003 Mazda6 3.0v6
B00Y1HSDGG|5|Easy Ordering Received items as smooth as advertised. Good Instructions. Thanks
B0049U2XPW|3|Its Ok
B0066KVDIQ|5|What a great idea to make my car look like new. They look wonderful. I recommend the Emblems to everyone!
B00IGZQT38|5|Fit perfectly in 2009-2013 Subaru Foresters.  Good protection.
B009OBW29S|5|I used it on my motorcycle and it gave my fuel tank a really nice shine ! Even took out some marks on it, but I really had put some elbow grease in to it !
B001G6GWJK|5|PArt worked well and installed easy enabled 1991 volvo 240 to shift into OD once again!
B00KSXWRZK|4|Great set of H.I.D's  Bulbs. The install was easy and pretty straight forward. I encountered zero issues with fitment or quality. So far they are performing great and the light output is great. No flickr or any other issues.
B007TYLTMS|5|Replaced one in the Carolla it looks just like oem and even had bulbs in it.
B001HNZ0CC|5|These floor mats fit my Jeep Cherokee and my Subaru Tribeca. They curve just right to the floorboard. They also clean up well. The picture doesn't do them justice.
B007630BFI|5|love it
B0007RDVFC|5|Awesome!
B00353M1DS|5|Excellent product! It's an exact fit to the OEM filter and is definitely worth it in the long run. It's washable so you won't have to worry about replacing the filter for a very long time. It is backed by a 1 million mile warranty.
B00JAB7V8O|4|fits and latches fine, plastic feels cheaper than factory buckles.
B0036R6IT6|5|My wife loves riding with me now.
B007SUV6I0|2|This one does not fit the Ford Expedition 1998 XLT 5.4  Amazon should review this item and mark it as such, it's misinforming the audience. This trailing arm is actually shorter than the one I needed to replace. Look out for Dorman 905-305 Trailing Arm instead.
B005C5AYCW|5|Works great
B00F0HB4R6|5|The best fitting, softest pant ever. Like a fleece lined legging only more of a pant material. Fleece waistband feels great. Nice!
B0019S8BDU|5|Works fine and a less expensive fix than ford replacement parts.. Hmmm Nine more words eh? Ok, buy them, its a quick inexpensive fix.
B004CGKQNO|2|I use these torx everyday and they are tough, but one day the #27 broke. I contacted OTC Tools through e-mail. Received an automated response, a copy of my e-mail to them. That's it. So good luck if you break a bit.
B004M0D0JM|4|A little large but well made, matches yellow and black paint of my vintage VW Bug. I have had compliments!
B009NMS2AQ|5|very easy to install. A lot better than the factory restricted manifold.
B002H9CMCQ|5|Good buy
B0002KR4PC|5|Okay, I know there have been a few negative reviews, but for the life of me I can't understand why.  I mean I have a 1995 Ford Taurus and this fits perfectly in my car and does what it is supposed to do.  I have a radar detector hooked up to this and I will be hooking up a GPS unit shortly.  So I have no complaints.  It works fine and for the price you can't pass this up.  If you want to blow your money then feel free to pay for a more expensive unit, but they all do the same thing.
B00BGYCKMA|2|Due to the construction of the key-fob this does not work for a buick, one side is open (needs to be) to be able to flip the key out. The whole cover slides around. Sturdy material tough.
B00342HVI0|4|I got these to replace 6 halogen lights in a fixture over my dining table. They replace 20W halogen bulbs, for only 2.6 watts.  Thats 1/10 of the power.  At 216 Lumens Compared to the 300 of a halogen, the resulting light loss was hardly noticeable to me.  They are definitely a whiter light than the more orange halogen that it replaced.  If you follow the $1/watt/year estimation for the cost of electricity, these will save me 17.4 watts per light, so $104.4 for the year. Paying for themselves in under a year in energy savings.
B00546Q1MQ|5|k
B006N01GEA|2|These look very good and installed with no issues; but the middle bushing that connects to the shock failed on both sides in 7 months. I had to replace both left and right side lower arm with a different brand.
B0029EVLI0|5|I was shakey at first about ordering this item because of the price. I thaught it might be cheap made product. But it turned out to be very good! Easy to install, about fifteen minutes and they look great. The shipping was very fast. I will be buying some more for my other car.
B008E9110W|1|They look nice, but are NOT &#34;error free&#34; as the listing states. Got errors in my car's instrument cluster the instant I installed them. Returning these bulbs and using something that doesn't cause my car to think that no bulbs are installed. What a waste of time.
B00C1AEOX6|5|Perfect
B000C7YA0W|5|I purchased an extra CPS for my 1994 Jaguar VDP just in-case. This was priced great and is even a genuine LUCAS part in a Standard Motor Products box. I hope to never have to install it.
B00HS1HOFI|1|Seemed like an awesome purchase. As soon as I installed it, my rear hazards started flashing. Obviously the wiring on this cheap switch isn't OEM correct. I would not recommend on purchasing this. Save yourself the hassle and spend the little extra on the AC Delco switch. If you didn't realize AC Delco are OEM parts on all Chevy vehicles.
B002OVYJ0K|5|This vent was an exact replacement for the one that was on my trailer for 20 years. I just used the lid (that I wish I could have bought separately), but the whole assembly was still inexpensive.
B0016KFV84|4|The hitch is very heavy and well built.  I used a jack stand to help support the opposite end while I bolted in the other.  My under carriage bolts were well seized from never being removed since 2001!!  I had a local shop remove the bolts for me so I could install the hitch at home. Instructions were very clear and it came with everything I needed, including the fish wire, which was pretty simple to use and a genius idea.  Hitch tucks in well and doesn't hang too low. Saved 50-75 bucks over uhaul.
B000CIN05M|5|Works well and satisfied with purchase.
B00266Z8LW|5|This product has given a different look to my BMW X5.<br />Now all the light bulbs have the same whiteness that I was looking for.
B00555F910|5|Bought this to replace an OEM part on a Dodge Caravan cooling system. The OEM assembly was $300. I used this part, about 3 feet of heater hose and hose clamps to fix it for about $15. I bought another just to keep as insurance.
B0054RW1HE|3|This set of mirrors will make your Jeep road-legal without the doors, but they won't keep you safe. Both mirrors are flat, meaning that the &#34;objects in mirror are closer than they appear&#34; setup you're likely used to on your passenger side won't be replicated. Getting them adjusted properly is a bit of a pain, and they're small enough that, even when &#34;properly adjusted,&#34; it's quite hard to see much.<br /><br />The driver's side is a much better story than the passenger's side, to be sure, but they aren't great. They smudge easily and they whistle a bit. But, they don't cost much, and they're easy to set up.
B0073MFFDA|5|Great product. ..still going strong
B0085XNX7Q|5|easy to install
B0014DGZ88|5|Much heavier duty than I expected.  Easy to remove when not needed. Great product for the price.
B0036GNSGS|4|There has been theft in my apartment complex, very excited Xena made this product! Seems to work great. The alarm is more than loud enough. Only one concern, I think I may have had a few false alarms however im not certain. Really dig it, I recommend it to others!
B00ARUPXTQ|5|Good fit for a Ford Expedition.
B001GMX5NK|5|I bought this to go on my 2011 Dodge Nitro. It took all of 15 minutes and seems to work just fine. I have only had this installed for a few days and will update if anything changes. I did find that once I had installed the connector, replacing the light was a little more difficult. Just be patient, look, and adjust the wire harness accordingly. You do not want to force it and snap off the guides in the back. Otherwise you could not ask for easier.
B000JZYXTU|4|Have had in for a little over a month. fits perfect on a 2005 mazda 3 2.0l. only took about 10 minutes to swap out this is an upstream sensor so was easy to get to on a mazda.
B009SQAFDY|5|Excellent bolts fit perfectly on my bmw f 650 gs 2007 it gave a new look to the firings and motor
B0045WBVUM|3|I suffer from a dislocated tailbone from a traumatic injury about a year ago. I am 6'1\\", 186lbs. and have a 2005 Suzuki Boulevard C50 with a wide \\"pan\\" seat\\". I bought the medium size Airhawk 2 and it fits pretty good. I too, as another reviewer suggested, criss-crossed the straps under the seat and it holds better that way without putting excess tension on the straps.<br />With the great reviews I saw all over the internet regarding the Airhawk 2, and with Mustang Gel seats going for around $400 - $500 dollars and not getting that great of reviews, I decide to give it a try. So far, I'm not too impressed for my intended purposes (allow me to ride my motorcycle with lessened pain for a slightly longer period of time vs. stock seat). I am not expecting miracles here. I followed the instructions and I seemed to have hit the sweet spot as far as inflation, I'm not sliding around on the pad, nor am I hitting the seat with my tush. However, I can only get slightly better relief as opposed to just sitting on stock seat. Better? Yes. Worth the cost? Jury is still out. I've only put in about 30 miles of riding so far, so I may have to update if I see improvement or lack thereof, literally ....\\"Your Mileage May Vary\\".<br />I will give the Airhawk 2 credit in that if I wasn't suffering from the tailbone injury, and pain with certain sitting positions, that this could work reasonably well for \\"iron butt\\" rides. It does give the sensation of floating on air and it did seem to keep my butt cooler. Gel seats have there inherent problems also, heat, costs, and still causing pressure points, albeit softer ones.<br />EDIT: Took off the bike because 1) I was not getting the reief I needed and 2) on really hot days air would expand in the thing and give me a feeling of riding on a pedestal and putting a funny pressure on the insides of my thighs as I amtrying to hug the tank with my knees. Not about yo constantly adjust the air in the thing, nor change my riding style (for safety reasons)<br />Looking to sell, less than 100 miles on it.
B000CN9J8Y|5|Easy fit, took me 5 minutes to install it
B003UXNQQO|5|The Fiesta Armrest Console from Boomerang is an essential add-on for the Ford Fiesta.  In addition to being simply an arm rest, it provides some storage space as well as a convenient cup holder. (Especially for a right-handed driver.)  It is well constructed and sturdy.  The Light Stone model exactly matches my Fiesta interior.  It is long enough to provide arm rest when the driver's seat is fully forward.  It conveniently lifts up out of the way for access to center console storage and the parking brake.  It comes with complete instructions for installation.
B0024E6ZW2|3|I bought these items in order to help with rocking of the camper, when getting in and out.  They seemed to be a bit too much of a pain setting up and taking down.  I found that you are best served to screw or attach them to your stair in order for them to work best.  if you try and just rest them underneath freely, they will slide around.
B000NCV1KS|5|It truly is custom-fit!  It fits perfectly and greatly reduces the heat buildup.  I'd buy some for the rear and side windows, if they made them.  Great job!
B00G620ZVU|5|Easy to install ..great product
B0007IFVZO|4|I bought this for my 99 Civic Si so I could bring my bike to the beach. Part of the installation includes inserting a bracket in to the rear frame and feeding a carriage bolt through the bracket. Could not get the bolt through the bracket because of its length. In order to get it through the bracket and frame,I had to grind an 1/8\\" off two sides so I could tip the bracket up to get the bolt through. This was after I called customer service at Curt who were friendly and did try to help. They sent me new brackets just in case I had to return the hitch if my \\"modification\\" didn't work. After getting it installed, I must say that I'm happy with my purchase. It doesn't detract from the look of the car and does what I need it to do.
B006V7TBDI|5|On the last Jeep Wrangler I had, I purchased some non-KC cheaper lights.  The cheaper lights looked OK, but no where near as nice as the KC lights.  Also the KC package came with everything I needed to install (with the exception of the windshield mounting brackets)... all wires, fuses, switch and even zip ties.<br /><br />I'll post a picture above of my white Jeep Wrangler with the KC lights installed on the windshield.<br /><br />Also the lights are very bright... much more of a spot light type beam rather than the more spread out headlights.<br /><br />I'm very happy with these lights.  The total package with looks, quality, and functionality.
B009ZCHFTI|5|I am glad I was able to find this product. This is the only pre-cleaner that I have found that works for the Ohio salt deposits on our cars.
B00180UVGO|5|Got it for the dad to put on his 2003 dodge Ram. solid sturdy and durable. I recommend for the easy of reaching the high rear ends of today's diesels
B00JV3ZNPO|1|I purchased this for a honda trail 70.  It doesn't fit mine and won't fit yours! bolt holes aren't in the correct orientation or the correct location, in addition, the lead is significantly shorter than stock. Just another amazon store selling junk, save your money and go to your local motorcycle shop.
B003EPLCBO|5|Beyond me why Harley doesn't put these bulbs in their bikes out of the factory..  Much brighter than what they install.  You can't have too much light on the road with a motorcycle at night.  Good product.
B000C59ZDQ|5|I bought these along with a leveling kit for my truck. If you are going to put longer coils to level your truck. The old ones pop out and the new ones slip in. Don't make the mistake I did. Lock these down really well. I lost one and had to buy a new one. The price for one at an auto parts store cost as much as the pair on here.
B007QV0R7W|5|Background: I'm a veteran ASE Master Certified Technician w/ L1 and X1 Certifications. I am also Lexus Senior Certified / Toyota Expert Certified / Nissan Certified / AC Delco Certified.<br /><br />I have owned all the models of Power Probe's: 1 through 3. These devices are great workhorses and hold up forever. All of mine are still in service and I use them in multiple locations. Whether your a DIY'er or an experienced technician these things will save you a lot of time and trouble, not to mention money if you are paid on a flat-rate scale. Yes I have all the fancy DVOM's and test leads but this guy gets used a lot more. If your looking for a product that will pay for itself the first time out: buy it!
B0022ZQZMS|5|Looks great and keeps the water out
B007T87RBQ|5|Got this for my husband who drives a big pick up and wants to be ready in case he needs to tow somebody out of a ditch.  He likes it, though I don't think he's had the opportunity to use it.
B007USQWWA|5|These cross bars are very sturdy and they fit perfect on the Sienna XLE Limited 2011, they took the roof rack with plenty of spare muscle for the load up, would buy again!!!
B001GH1OPG|1|These are made from a high density foam around a small piece of polyurethane. I cannot speak to the possibility of there being several variations (some being all polyurethane) of this product, as I only ordered one set, but I can say that my packaging had &#34;07-14 JK Wrangler&#34; printed on it so I suspect that this is the most recent version.<br /><br />Unfortunately you have to use a bit of force (either twisting or pushing) to insert them into the hole for the factory bump stops and the foam breaks easily. It seems that the individual pieces vary greatly in quality as one went in with no issues and the other broke immediately.
B00KBKOAGY|5|Very stable.  Holds on tight, flips down easy, and blocks enough sun.  Also, there is no gap between this shade and the car visor.
B00FY80OFO|1|the service is fine, but the part did not fit my truck.  need more info to identify supplied parts.
B004BFW0EO|5|much better than other water spot remover
B008L4YWNI|1|Was very disappointed and would not order from them again. The packing job was very poor which resulted in dents and dings all over one rotor which was purely cosmetic but should not of happend. Besides that I've had both rotor profesionally installed with new pads and I continue to hear loud horrible scraping sounds in lower speeds.  I would recommend spending the extra buck and buying name brand the first time so you won't be stuck paying for them twice like I now have to.
B001JKXJF8|5|Fits my truck perfectly
B0015PMQDI|1|We were sorry to learn that it's well known in the finishing community that you're not to use this product in a saltwater environment. It just keeps hazing up.
B007ZSZAKK|4|Was a great item, put them right on the sun vizors of my truck, and they work great!!
B008KZ0CXW|5|I got this for a 2008 GMC Acadia.  I did not want to have to buy another brake controller so I just got this harness and share between the tow cars.
B0007ZFTJA|5|i have many cars..far the best products i ever try...<br />easy to used<br />see results after first try..<br />a friend order a (16 oz.)and same amazing result
B000JZGF00|5|Looked all over for this part and once found price was not right. Amazon to the rescue!!! As usual. Will definitely make a habit with checking on amazon first.
B003XL7HDQ|4|I love the look on my new 2013 Ram 1500! However, it should come with the tailgate sealer sold by Extang! Since I installed the tailgate sealer it has reduced the amount of water intrusion, but not solved it? Is better than nothing though! I just put items in Lawn Trash bags to assure they stay dry!
B002R1MT40|4|After I put it on my Honda Accord 2001. I can see more better and it look so bright at night. I love it
B001D6GYLO|5|This product was able to charge what I needed to use it for.  I use it for a 12volt battery and it works perfectly.
B0050DBKWO|1|I would not recommend this bag, especially for the price. I thought it would be much sturdier. The velcro doesn't hold it in place once any more than a couple of items are in it. The pockets are too small. The mirror that is included is a joke and looks like a &#34;fun house&#34; mirror. Very disappointed.
B00K5VVNAK|5|I placed it on my laptop facing it so it the Kitty is showing her finger.  A God's send to be left alone!!!
B0086E2K8W|1|Did not fit my 2001 bmw 325i as ordered for. Designed for a coupe, not a sedan. Wasted time and money
B00JVUNB0G|5|Oh yes.  Definetely cool.  Everybody loves it...
B002833Z18|5|Perfect replacement for OEM on my 1975 corvette stingray. Would recommend to anybody.  Brought back the original look and made very well.
B001G8GZKY|5|The guard I received seems to be welded straight and strong with no issues.  The final buffed shine is a little rough but nothing to complain about for the money.  The fog lights are not included in the purchase price as the photo suggests.  Would definately buy again and recommend to others.
B007EYG6EY|2|The fit was different than the original. Much more difficult to get into place. I purchased XTreme Vision headlights and with these generic lenses the lights are not anywhere as close to as bright as the originals. Alignment brackets broke on the first adjustment.  I would not purchase these again.
B004TCIUW0|3|The shine is good from this wax. I'm not sure how long it will last since it has only been two weeks but it still looks good. However, the wax is very hard to remove from your vehicle. I prefer NXT 2.0. It's easier to work with and I think it's worth the slightly extra cost.
B00LX28WAO|3|No problem with lights. Just not as bright as I thought they would be.
B0002JMDCC|5|I love this stuff, I use it as a cleanser before I do my glaze and wax. I highly recommend it.
B006N95Y3A|1|The factory GM tie rod ends lasted 11 years and 106k miles on my 2003 Chevy Cavalier. In fact, they were still functional when i replaced them, but they boots had started to rot, so I went ahead and replaced both sides with these. These ACDelco tie rod ends lasted 3 Months and less than 3,000 miles. The boots have split vertically and peeled back like an orange. The build quality looked promising to begin with, but after I fought for 20 minutes to get the grease zerk to thread in properly, I should have returned them right then. I don't know what GM used as OE tie rod ends in 2003 when I bought the car, but it certainly wasn't these. Time to replace them and pay to have an alignment done all over again.
B009SQZ17E|5|Fit nice on my car! Made a huge performance difference! Was such a good product i had to order another set for my other civic!
B001O1IY4I|4|Does the job there is a gap between the seats and the cover.
B00ARUSW3U|5|exactly as described. easy to install.
B000HI79F4|5|Just what we wanted
B00AUYRTDW|5|Work perfect for my yamaha ttr but forgot to order the glue it needs to hold it in place
B0050V6J5O|5|this double size radiator is well built<br />and big enough to cool an 8 cylinder engine.<br /><br />we purchased it to replace a normal size radiator.
B0028OE96C|4|These really make the Etrack's look professionally installed. Only downside would be that if you loose the last Etrack hole due to the tabs that protrude what seem to go too far under the Etrack.  I'm curious if I can cut the tabs a little bit.
B00VAVOMFC|5|Came as advertised dropped right in, easiest strut replacement I have done.  Did raise front of 2007 Tahoe about 2 inches and got rid of factory rake which was a nice surprise.  Ride is improved and stiffer but still smooth.
B009QVXTTI|4|thay work I just wish it was biger
B005RR42LY|5|Perfect fit and looks really nice
B005EB6N8S|5|Not quite what I wanted but has came in handy
B004HE6UMC|5|Exactly as described. Fit in my 2005 Grand Prix perfectly and are working well.
B0009H50WM|4|As good as Blitz wax and doesn't leave streaks if over applied like Blitz wax often does.
B00H29LGI2|4|Look good but have to mount them over the winter
B003FXEY9W|5|works really good and built well. I would but this item again and recommend it to others Glad I bought it!!
B006X152SU|4|Nice bag
B000CONMV8|4|every time i put it on, I have to move something ...then take it off again ... off & on... off & on ... off & on  Get the picture ?
B000CAO7XO|4|Does what it says on the tin, doesn't seem to be breaking apart after a few months of use. Could be a bit easier to get the CDs in/out of the sleeves. Do keep it on your passenger side visor as dropping it down while driving WILL obstruct your view.
B000CLL830|5|This is The  Exact Part for my vehicle1996 Toyota Celica St
B001OCXHR6|5|Exactly as expected
B001NZQID4|4|Perfict fit.
B006TMRIZ8|3|This product was what I was looking for, to fix my car.
B002XL2IEA|5|I set my compressor to 35 psi, connect it to the adapter, and then easily sent from faucet to faucet purging the water from the system.  The hot water tank took a little bit more time, but I was able to purge the unit too.
B006QH54WU|5|This is my fourth optima battery.  I have had excellent experience with them.  I bought this one to replace a Sears platinum battery that was more expensive than this battery when I had to replace the Sears for the second time in 5 years.  I have had my other optima batteries for 7 years and they still work great.  These are an excellent choice for boats, and I even have one in my car that has been going for 8 years.  I love these  batteries.
B00JV765NY|1|Fits so loose that they light up sometimes and not other times. It's weird.
B00HJB6AS4|5|good buy
B0002MA8TE|5|Used this product for a recent trip to Tennessee from new Jersey. It did rain a bit, and product did not let any water in. Did not need any extra bungee cords to keep bag secure. Bag did not loosen up at all. Product worked as advertised
B008JBCDJS|5|Amazing product, includes every detail shown in photo.<br />However, please mind the measurements in description because it's definitely not the size implied in the product photos. It is much smaller.<br />Also, LEAVE IT ALONE for the time it says on the sheet, or it'll become the biggest regret of your life.<br />Asides from the big difference in size, it is really well made and it looks awesome, and I'd buy from this seller again. Especially now that I have an actual size reference.<br />Thank you for your product!
B002YKFA0O|5|A great device!!!
B001GG89CS|4|High-quality decal, easy applicaton.I wish it was a little smaller and the chin a little thinner-almost looks like a green spiderman.lol.<br />Instead on placing it on car I stuck it to the top of my lab top looks kewl!!!
B000B6AFE4|5|I used it to replace my worn out and torn headliner, it is decent quality, fair price. I would def use and buy it again.
B009996ZCU|5|perfect fit
B002YCFQBU|5|Cheap and good quality. Fits my car perfectly. Would definitely buy again.
B003UXFNTW|5|The handle is easy to grip and the applicator foam glides over the sidewall effortlessly. I expected these applicators to be cheap and cheesy, but they are lasting.
B00B54SJIK|2|Kept interferring with vehicle automatic start and would lock up the radio from working at all.  After having to reset it about a dozen times I removed it and returned it.
B009ZXCSO4|5|Great product. Leather really looked like new.<br />Service is great too!!
B000JFJLP6|5|My son in law had a similar one of these I had bought him at Sears.  It quit working so I ordered this one for him.  This is the one I replaced the Craftsman I owned that quit working with.
B0007LEG2K|1|Wow what a piece of junk. Worked for about 2 months and broke. All I get is a \\"NO LINK\\" message. Have tried on many cars but to no luck. Don't waste your money buy something else
B00480N16S|5|No complaints here, they are very bright and have a decent look to them. If your looking for white get HIDs, if you want a good cheap bulb, get these. I bet you wont be disappointed.<br /><br />I will have to see there longevity otherwise perfect.
B000GTJFOC|2|The quality isn't that great for everyday use. The needle fell out first time and the rubber tipped fitting won't stay on. The other pieces I haven't used.
B0002TP2C0|3|The charger works fine, but the wires from the charger to the clips gets very warm from being too small.  My old Scumacher charger has much heavier wire and doesn't heat up.  I changed the wires from the old one to the new one and the problem was solved.  You cannot run that kind of amperage thru such small wires.  That is basic electicity 101.  Come on people.  I would never dare to run this thing the way it was while I was away from home.
B001OCXB5Y|5|I installed it myself with no help from anyone. It took just over an hour. I recommend an air ratchet once you get the self locking nuts started. It wore me out doing it the old fashioned way. I also do recommend to have someone assist with holding it up during installation. I bought this just after a deer took out my grill and headlight and the insurance company broke it off in me. This is a lot of protection for the front end. It looks great.
B008RIEQXY|5|They are great  not to bright
B003POGJ80|5|Easy to install. bought for my parents car and my Dad had no problems installing 10 minutes tops.\<br />I would recommend
B001O2T43M|1|The sucker part was missing, & the smaller plactice handle broke before I even got anywhere (maybe during shipping)  so I was force to go to the store to have the repair completed. The tools sucked all in all,  To add more problems the replacement was Not a screen for an iPhone , but a sencer for a iPod touch.. Luck for me the repair lady traded me parts and fixed my phone for $25.00 .This was nothing but a waste a waste of money & time for me.
B0006I0NBM|4|While a bit on the cheap side, it works good for my needs, I did not use the supplied rubber stopper, I used the one off the old holder it replaced because the older one was better, it was rounder and stiffer than this one.
B004VIA1AG|5|Great for off road and street use. A bit stiff at first but tends to form tothe wearer as time passes. Taken some good dirt crashes without a problem.
B000E4RYLA|5|I always hate buying aftermarket, but the price was to good to pass up and take a chance.<br />Surprisignly for an aftermarket part, this handle fit very well! No modification what so ever. perfect OEM fit.
B00230J506|5|Great product good quality
B004A2IFII|5|Can't beat OEM fuel filters
B007GGJYSU|4|Mirror assembly is well made and fitment was as good as the original mirror I removed.  Power mirror functions work just like OEM.  I had to paint the mirror to match the original painted mirror.  I didn't have any adhesion problems priming and painting to match.
B001LEJ32A|5|I got this to install in a fireplace for a DIY fireplace heat exchanger to heat the house in the winter.  It works perfectly!  Has just enough flex to fit well into the fireplace and extend from both sides.  Hooked up a pc fan blower and some flex duct on one end, and voila.  Works perfectly.<br />Power went out for 3 days last winter, but we had heat for the entire house because of this sturdy flexible galvanized pipe.
B0054RW1HE|5|Although they are small compare to original mirrors they work good for not having doors on the jeep. Good product and quick delivery too .
B0031I8096|1|These drums are not balanced and when the car got above 60 MPH the caused a violent shaking and vibration that was scary.  I thought one or more of my tires had balance or belt separation issues.  After repairing/replacing, hub assemblies and tires with no improvement, I replaced these junk drums with some Centric Premium brake drums and no more shaking and shimmying.  What a fiasco!!!
B00GWVLWHQ|5|My brother loves this, he put it on the back window of his car and it looks great.
B000LEPT5G|3|Bought an &#34;06 chevrolet and had to buy new reader but this worked great for me up to '02 models.
B0058V9CF0|5|installed in minutes greatbuy
B001FHZYBM|5|great price fits good
B000C8ZBY0|5|I couldn't find this part locally and I wanted to have a nice clean install on my 2001 Jeep Cherokee. Part arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed!<br /><br />PS - Dynomax and Walker are the same company... Part numbers are the same.
B00DAJFJRC|4|like it but haven't used it.
B00QFEJVG4|5|Fits my 4Runner perfectly.
B000GZBZOE|3|Look Good but after a couple of weeks the front ones fell right off.  The tape doesn't stick well even when directions are followed and window wells are cleaned out.
B003JJAUWW|5|Well made, attractive quality leather and no bad smell.  The chaps fit exactly as expected.  I highly recommend this item.
B004A0RDGK|4|Not much to say here, it's an oil filter and it works as it's supposed to. It's was a good fit with my 2012 Sienna.
B000ALDRIQ|5|It is already installed in my car, very good product, fits perfectly. Works excellent. No problem at all with the delivery of the product.
B004RHMKZK|5|It fit great and the paint on them is better than stock
B004XWUNPI|5|nothing but yummy sound coming from my Subaru now, it drones for about a week until its all &#34;broken in,&#34; quite when you need it to be and loud at wide open throttle.(I also installed a catted downpipe and EL headers so mine was a little louder than just the catback) but you will not be disapointed.
B00FRHOI86|4|It met all my needs, the only thing I didn't like were all the attachment things.
B0014HZF1C|5|I got this short ram and it was easy to install and looks and sounds great and you could feel the difference :) thanks
B00K890RBU|5|Inexpensive, and worked as a functional replacement for the original battery in the Simon Security keypad. You will need to reset the battery sensor in the Simon Keypad, otherwise the keypad will continue to show there is still a low battery condition. The shipment packaging could be better, although my battery arrived with no issues, the padded USPS mailing envelope may not be sufficient protection for other shipments.
B002UCYRZU|1|This does not work. I tried polishing and polishing. Does not do anything. The cloth they add are just paper towels. It's a joke.
B00TFZY9E4|5|This spacers fits like sharp on the hub , however the bolts did not fit the wheels on my maverick xrs so i had to drill the bolt holes on my wheels about 1 mm to make it fit .<br />over all quality and design is very good .
B00GSAUHB8|4|Packs well and can be stored away in car door pocket.  Covers front windshield well (4-door sedan, midsize).  Lightweight.  My question at this point will be durability.  Sure makes a difference getting in and out of the car in the heat.
B0053HOX4O|4|What can you say, its a fuel tank... it does a good job of holding fuel. It will swell up if the cap isnt loosened. or a small hole is drilled in the cap.
B009PHKPOA|2|You have to buy the charger separate.  And if you need an adapter for the charger (because your outlets are different) you are buying two products just to make this one work. Frustrating.
B00BGD88I6|5|Love the product .Just got a new 2013 black f150 and needed some style.Easy to install and looks like it will last a while. Wife even likes it .I did have to tell her what it was.
B0002KKHS8|5|Once again, recommended by a fanatical service provider. I use it on interior surfaces and it obviously protects and lasts. Probably the biggest advantage is that it does not result in a bright shine on my dashboard that is reflected in the windshield. Been using it for years and will continue to do so.
B000IYR52O|4|I've had it in the car for about 7 months now....... Its like any other radiator...... I put this one in a 98 honda accord.... It didnt fit perfect.... It would have been nice if it did but it wasnt a deal breaker.... I had to make a very small modification that anyone can do... If your planing on changing radiator your self you will be able to figure out small adjustment....... For the price its well worth it!!!
B0036NEUW2|5|I was really surprised as how durable these floor mats are.. They are mot cheaply made. Nice and sturdy floor mats.. I highly reccomend tham.
B006X8BYOE|4|I installed this myself, and let me say the instructions SUCK. Total crap. But once you figure it out, it's worth it :)
B00HS0HEBI|1|Don't spend your money in that waste, shock is a fake from china is not safety to use in your car, i had to remove and put my old shock on my Prelude 92 is a fake and very bad Quality item
B003SOJVMS|5|Perfect replacement for original part. Swapped it out in less than an hour.
B00UY58OFO|1|It was not stated as the pic.. It only covers the front passenger and driver sides, does not cover the back. It does me no good, but not sending it back because I threw away the box. BUY AUTO PARTS is a RIP OFF!!!
B00B29SZU0|5|Fits the 2014 GMC Sierra perfectly. They work well for the kids mishaps and the muddy work site. Definitely worth getting.
B0009XQUKC|5|A QUALITY TOOL THAT PERFORMS VERY WELL . A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WORKING ON MODERN FUEL SYSTEMS. THIS TOOL GIVES ALOT OF INFO FOR DIAGNOSING FUEL PROBLEMS. THE LONG HOSE IS VERY HANDY , EASY TO READ GAUGE.
B00BVYY38O|1|Waste of money. They blew after a week of use.<br /><br />Don't buy these, period. They look good and fit right, but the product is flawed. They need some quality control.
B0008FUF34|5|great hitch pin  easy to pull with the added rubber coating and helps stop rust works great and true dimentions with no slop
B001QIUGVI|3|I like that it allows reading SRS and ABS codes.  However, it takes many fewer OBD II sensor readings than does my much older AutoXray scanner.  Still worth having so I am generally satisfied.
B005BYEI58|5|My husband really likes his Ford Racing License tag, he picked out the design & it looks sharp on his new vehicle I brought him.
B00AZ4QJFQ|3|keeps coming unstuck?
B009DJPT7S|5|Great arrived fast and good quality.
B00590X5VM|5|Met our expectations, delivery, fit & price.
B00KEKX85A|1|It's ok
B00E2U3S6W|1|Junk! Had it maybe 2 months, the black turned to gold and the plastic lense started to sun crack. Also 3 LEDs were dim in a corner then 2 worked and the other one went black. Had higher expectations for one of these with the way people talk about them. Better off buying one for $300
B000C7UO0M|1|Prongs in plug end of the sensor were smaller and the shape of the plug end was not exactly the same as on my wife's 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan so it would not make a good connection. Purchase a sensor from the local auto parts store that had the correctly shaped plug and larger prongs for a snug/correct fit. The plug end was too oval shaped where it needed to be more square with rounded corners. At least now the air temp reads correctly and the A/C works once again, but it's not because of this sensor.
B00KZJQ2L2|3|Tall enough for a Honda Civic, but so wide it won't overlap enough to fit well.
B002K3ZQPO|5|I am very pleased with this part, how fast I received and the price. Compared to the price Mercedes Benz parts dept quoted me ($462)  and after reading reviews on this manufacturer  part, it was a great choice.
B00ROVNZ1O|3|Good
B00265FXTA|3|Not quite the color I expected, will wait to see if the spectrum improves as it &#34;seasons&#34; according to other buyers' experiences.
B009DJQRPG|3|Motor weak. Window rolls up but strains and motor loud.
B005DJRDDK|5|I drilled holes to secure the shield to the car more securely. The shield is pretty sturdy and does a good job in reducing the love bugs on the windshield. Gives the car a distinctive look also.
B00EKF5NR6|1|I bought these tail lights two months ago the seal already went bad and water is inside.
B00INT76N4|5|good
B0041RV1D8|5|Wife loves it.  A lot cheaper than buying her a car with seat warmers..  We can even move it to my car when needed.<br />This is very useful and still going strong three years later
B001L9PYTG|3|I ordered a 2X and it fits like a tight XL. Might want to order 1-2 sizes up. Seems like good quality, tho.
B00801RNEC|1|Worked for 1 month
B006MDH3JK|5|Thanks
B004UHF7GG|5|Damn good deal,for 15 bucks I got the battery I needed with more preformence than I could ask for.<br />Thanks,Amazon and the scooter parts depot.
B008AEKLTI|5|I wanted an actual Ford OEM re-key kit because the ignition was worn out on my truck and I still wanted all my keys to match.  This kit was perfect!  Easy to install and it came with 4 keys.  Very happy.
B00GWFE5GW|4|The only reason I gave four stars is because I didn't realize there were filters to replace. It did come with three extra ones but a washable one would have been ideal of course. Otherwise power is excellent, the light is nice for getting under seats, the cord is long, I like the color of it, and the brush it comes with is good for getting AC vents and areas that are textured like the dashboard. It also got here over two weeks sooner than the estimated delivery date so that was a plus. Overall I'm very satisfied.
B000BRFQLK|5|Worked perfectly to replace a broken part on our travel trailer.
B00NOA8NCU|5|Clean 6000k color thats as bright as hids with less problems
B005HMHVSA|5|Love the white light. Looks much better and provides better illumination.
B000NOKNKA|5|Good
B004XJ3R7C|5|It's about the simplest way to protect your carpet from damaged grocery packaging and other mishaps. It's a good invesment.
B001NZM14E|5|Good part, shipping time and excelent package. This part works like same as original or genuine part.
B00CK0V65Q|5|stuck to window great easy to install
B0087NB1IW|5|If you don't think it's loud enough you are already going deaf. The bass is not for these speakers and no matter where you mount the mic I've been told I'm still clear. Battery life is good I guess I charge mine every few days or so. Love it!
B00ID2VVUA|3|They are very cheap but look at the price - You pay for what you get - they are functional and will serve the purpose - not a very durable made product - time will tell - But im happy for now
B00H26N40I|3|The Chevy S-10 Tear Drop Metal Key Ring was a little disappointing. It is significantly smaller and lighter in weight and mass than what I was expecting. However, it was priced accordingly.
B00BMDB5NK|5|Perfect fit. Product as described. Fast shipping.
B001DLM346|5|Purchase of this product went smoothly.  product just as I had expected.  Would buy again.
B00H34F2BI|5|Treat your leather to this product! They wil thank you for it. Nice smell, conditions leather seats like a champ. Highly recommend
B0041CDPQO|5|Very pleased with the quality of this product, I was expecting a cheap plastic one that wouldn't last very long..... I was wrong, this is built to last. The cord is heavy duty. I wish that it could include a in line fuse to help protect whatever you are plugging in to this, but other than that I'm very excited to install this on my victory!
B00296CJC0|2|It's not really a bright red as it appears on my calibrated 27&#34; Thunderbolt monitor, and I can't use it on what I had planned. Oh well. I've used the paints before and they are high-quality paints, but this one is the wrong color.<br /><br />The lesson is go to a store to see what the colors are in person, then buy then here cheaper I guess :)
B004LWVEKS|5|Wow Very fast shipping and de product very good I well recommended
B00498ZR7A|5|I retrofitted my 2004 GMC Yukon XL Denali with standard KYB monotube shocks that normally go on a  Suburban of Tahoe Z71 along with these springs versus paying $2400 for the original electronic shocks.  The rear end is about 2 inches higher but the SUV is riding perfect and ready for another 250k miles!!
B000EH4V0Y|4|Pretty un-needed.  Shipped kinked, wasn't worth straightening.<br /><br />However, the measurement was nice
B000MINXYA|5|I ordered this seat belt cover some time ago and it is still working very well. It was not actually my most favorite design, but at the time I liked it better than any I saw and now am more pleased with it as time goes by. It stays put, and has done a very very good job. I am in my car frequently for work, and am so happy that I have this protector. It is well made, soft where it hits my neck, and keeps the seatbelt from cutting into my neck and skin. I would recommend this to others as a great deal.
B000ABCHH8|4|Bought this to take a shot at fixing a slow leak in my front tire. I have a 2013 high-end Hyundai (lease) and did not want to deal with the clown-shoe music of going to the dealer (basically wasting a whole day).  So far - so good. I was getting the &#34;low tire pressure&#34; alert every 2-weeks, and it was annoying. I was scared to use this stuff as it may mess with the electronics? It did not and it's been 6 weeks and the tire is great and losing no pressure.
B007VRF6WM|5|As stated already, it is a super pain to install the casters. Best to first remove caster axle bolts and remove the wheels. But even then it is almost impossible to fit any tool in to grip caster stem nut while you tighten stem nylock nut. I used a pair of channel lock pliers but it still took 30 minutes and lots of slips.  Once assembled, it's perfect!..A really good buy for the price..I'ma get another one!  Edited to add: I just ordered another one. I'm building a 454/496 stroker for a buddy for his monster mud truck...I'll adapt this new stand as a engine run/test stand...Save me a lot of welding.
B00GBW09G6|5|I liked the fact that it was easy to install and it was the exact replacement for the one I removed from my Jeep
B000KYYM46|4|Fast delivery.  It is not easy to find a local locksmith for key cutting with reasonable price.  They want to sell me both key cutting service and a same key in >$100.  Finally got a free key cutting from HomeDepot, then I programmed the key by following the instruction sent with this item.  Now the new key works to my 2007 Rav4. If this item was a little less expensive, I should give a five star rating.
B00NIHOZP8|4|Bright, but not 48W or even close to it.  I measure 1.82Amps input at 20.1Volts on each light plus or minus 0.01Amps.  That's less than 37W.  But they do seem reasonably well constructed, and they are very bright still.  For the price ($31), I would recommend them, but understand exactly what you are buying.  I used the pair on a spare halogen work light tripod and easily replaced a 500W halogen with both lights turned on.  Overall I am very happy with the purchase, but taking off a star for the inaccurate product description.
B000JQF94C|5|For 2014 Chevrolet Tahoe PPV stops mud and debris from piling up on running boards, the rears help keep back window Tailgate clean..A plus!
B008NYXZY8|5|Awesome helmet at a  great price .great fit ,cool looks and graphics ,the visor doesnt fogs up ,and also the dark smoke visor i also bought to fit this helmet is abolutely worth it  day and night.For some reason i didn't see the breath deflector when i collected the helmet , so thats a minor set back.
B000ZPI3S6|5|Just as described, great size/fit on key chain.  Bought one for every driver in the house.
B0078T55Z6|5|Great price, and came just as described, even earlier, is a really good protector, can't wait to order more, my husband loves it.
B00080QHMM|4|it works well and I can clearly see the results without squinting.
B0021UMTZQ|5|Okay it is not the best for rubber and it gets fairly brittle so you can not use it to fix cracks in a kayak ( no I did not, I already knew better) I DID fix a old heavy duty saltwater rod with it and that was impressive.... Also fixed a rubber flashlight and a bait bucket. Next I will fix a gas can to see what THAT does...
B005DM2NN2|5|Perfect light. Attached to a go kart and works great!
B002IC7YO8|2|Good quality.<br /><br />That being said, I ordered white (SM1230c) and it's not, it's clear.
B001AWE4BI|5|These flares are the cats meow, and fit right over the top of OEM flares on my 2009 RZR must drill holes to mount,  but bye bye mud and water inside the Rzr, believe me we gave them the test.  Made water and mud fly away and out and not in. Flares are a must with the wider larger tires and wheels I have 26X11RX14 tires.
B001CO2JHU|5|Bought this for X-1018-BR 4.5&#34; Injen Air Filter to put on a 1996 Eagle Talon TSi AWD.  Great fit, looks amazing, and works phenomenally.  Already drove through rain and when I popped the hood in the garage, this shield had stopped some mud and particles from getting into my filter.  Just takes 2 minutes to take it off and rinse, then pat dry with a towel and reinstall.<br /><br />Highly recommend getting one for any performance vehicle or for a great tuneup!
B0010VNLK4|4|good plugs
B000276D0W|3|Many parts to mount and assemble.  Order A weight rating at least one size larger than you need, these things are not structurally over designed.  Mechanical items are alright, but not spectacular.<br /><br />Works, is somewhat complex for function, is overpriced.
B00OUM8GLY|3|Ordered the small for my Yaris (small car), and unfortunately it was too small, but I liked the construction and material, so I returned it and ordered the large, only to find that it's the exact same size. the only difference is the amount of loose fabric around the edges. The wire rings on the Large and the Small have the exact same height measurement of 25 inches... too small for my car. The item description should give an exact measurement of the ring sizes, rather than estimating a range of acceptable applications.
B002LEYC70|5|perfect fit, right price!!
B00YGJE7FK|5|Great for extra coverage, and easy install.
B00QEZY4QQ|1|The red paint came off immediately.
B00MB0EX46|5|It looked like the diamonds were poorly glued in but it's a great cheap frame.
B005QPPSG0|1|The picture on line shows 8 stickers, when in reality you only get 1 sticker. That is why you get the feeling it is to good to be true!
B0039OO56Y|3|Does the job... kind of hard to get excited about.
B000BPQGSY|5|Very Good
B00A2D2PY4|5|Finally found the wire to connect my previous radio to my new Jeep Wrangler TJ
B004KL0I9I|4|It allowed me to solve several fault codes with my Ford Focus and revise other sensor data needed to improve gas mileage and overall performance. Great buy.
B00DQW1CFG|1|Just program it for my 2008 Jeep Wrangler and it was good and responsive for the first two weeks afterwards you Have to be 1 m Close do you have it Responding
B009LN75MS|1|only lasted 1 1/2 years, car was driven about 13,000 miles
B002VVPSTY|5|Scott is always good . . !<br />- great fit .<br />- great color .<br />- great look . -
B003IS3HV0|5|my favorite old leather chair looks and feels much better!
B007Q6FDC6|5|It's beautiful in person! I wasn't sure about it in the pictures, I liked it, but I wasn't sure how it would look in person. It's great quality, thick/sturdy. There are little stickers to practice with or put on your bike. I cannot wait to get home and put this on my bike!!!
B002UW7JJ6|5|Good product.  Noisy, but once I placed it under the passenger seat, it's barely audible.  Then again, I ALWAYS have my stereo on too.  I could see those who like silent driving, having an issue with the noise factor.  For what it's worth, I'd rather have the fan noise than a potential fire in my car.  No issues running laptop (240W) and phone charger at the same time, converter was able to handle load for more than 16 hours without ever shutting down.  It stayed nice and cool (warm to the touch).
B001T9AFBK|5|Great product, love it.
B000GPVHGK|5|I have had the automobile club in my car for many years,and it seems to keep people away if I am not at a show.I am ASSURED that the Truck club is equally as valuable to protecting my International 9670 cabover!This is aa GREAT product in my eyes!!
B00877DBKY|5|awesome came on time with 2 of them let it said i put one on my is300 but i lost the other one my wife wants one on her car lol ill be ordering more soon had no problem putting them on was really easy to do just make sure yu use a credit card to get the bubbles out as yur putting it on i recommend this to any one.
B001EZ2KZ8|5|Good wipers and have never had a problem with them as their the only ones I can find that will fit<br />my 1997 Jeep Wrangler.
B00629OL1W|5|Works great!
B00TIXB1QW|4|Exactly as described in photo.  Have to find something to put this on now.
B000C59V58|4|The grease fitting hole was not threaded, so I had to tap it myself. Otherwise it worked fine.
B00MQ1DHLU|4|They sent two. Easy install, Very good. Old mirror  was scratched. Would recommend to any one that has broken or scratched mirror.
B00BLX1L4O|1|Product is a very low quality.  Does not adhere well to steering wheel.
B00I82BWB8|5|fit  and worked for my purpose
B00G6UZIE6|5|Perfect for the outdoors type of people way better then those dump stick poeple! And the camo on it was good!
B00DEC0LP0|4|Fits like a glove. Ends don't meet the sills but the look and black color match the interior perfectly. Can't ever have enough Ram's head logos either. The mats are well made and cover well. They will do the job fine when carrying passengers with muddy or snowy feet.
B002IBRI9K|4|Nice clear white light, better than the yellowish stock fog light.
B00KL7TZH6|1|The image compared to actual product was a disappointment
B00RKXSHS2|5|Work perfect in my 2008 Patriot<br />Just got a 2002 chevy got asecond set for this vehical thay do not fit so i will have to return them and order the other size. My bad not theirs.
B005VPWSMW|5|Product received as promised and fits my dodge avenger perfectly.
B003E3K9AQ|5|snapped on and adds style to the front grill
B00069D55M|5|fits perfectly and helps when towing the trailer
B000CMFRFO|5|Great.
B000C19DL4|2|Not as expected. After receiving and reading directions, it seemed pretty difficult to install. Alot of trouble only locking one side of the tailgate. The package I received was covered with dust and dirt, looked like it had been in the warehouse for years! And Amazon still charged me shipping to return it!
B008HR6J0S|5|Ordered this for my wife's 2008 expedition and it worked like a charm. It's a pink fob and the outer shell reads ford motor cor.<br /><br />Buttons are easy to press and click righ away.
B000BYD6U6|5|I installed these wires after my check engine light came on with a code &#34;misfire #4 cyl.&#34; At first I had installed Taylor wires at a cost of $100 during a tune up 9 months earlier and never would of thought the wires had already gone bad but when I opened the hood at night it was like a lightning show. I then replaced with MSD wires and problem solved for another 5 months until same issue. My buddy who works as a mechanic said try the OEM Bosch wires so I did. Been 6 months and no check engine light and I think my Dodge Ram 4x4 5.9l runs better then ever. Don't waste money on expensive high performance wires when these work better on a stock motor.
B000RXNLK6|5|Excellent product for a quick shine and seems to help to repel dirt and water marks. 45 minutes to do the entire SUV.
B001VLK0RA|3|Service was great came in less than a week as for the pump it's slow even tried putting in fresh battery same thing but beats sucking gas from a tube don't know how it will last I'll be looking for a manual pump.
B000BUR9O4|1|I tried two cans of this product and reset my engine light drove around for about 50 plus miles light came back on so i wouldn't recommend but it was worth a try for the price
B004SRC5GI|5|Dorman Window Regulator  was a perfect match for my vehicle. I looked just like the original. I saved so much money. Thanks Amazon.
B00029KBGM|5|Just what you'd expect from the pictures. No surprises or disappointments. Sucks all of the accessories, brackets mountings are so ridiculously over priced. No prob. though just made my own. The aluminum is easy enough to work and drill through.
B009FNX7BW|4|I had no trouble with the installation.  My girls can get on and out of my Nissan with ease.
B000C913FA|1|Incorrect size
B00A6WTK2G|3|I was going to use them as marker lights. I replaced an amber bulb with a clear lens and it really was not bright enough. Tried them in a different car with an amber lens and it was better but still not very bright.
B000C9KWD4|5|installed on a 1993 Mitsubishi 3000gt fit perfectly easy to install once the tie rod end was removed seems just as good as factory and far less money
B000CKSY38|5|I was told that I would need to spend around $800 for a Condenser from Toyota.  I had a friend install a new AC Compressor in my 2006 Toyota Sienna and a few weeks later, the new compressor went out as well.  He said that the Condenser was not working properly and causing improper pressures on the compressor--thus causing it to fail again.  After he installed this Spectra Premium Condenser, I had my AC back and it's been going strong for several months now.  I would recommend this to anyone with an 06 Sienna that needs a Condenser.  I don't know what other years of the Sienna that this is compatible with but Amazon does a great job with telling you what's compatible when you tell them what you drive.
B000CPAG1Q|1|-to Todd Hunt. There is no size listed, what you saw was the dimensions of the box they come in.
B000P6UNKQ|5|I purchase this bracket with a Lincoln grease gun, long extension hose and needle type fitting. I mounted the whole works on a 4\\"x1\\"x18\\" piece of oak. What I ended up with is a Grease gun that could sit on the ground with a long flexible hose that I use to grease the Cv Joints on my Sand Rail. The needle point lets me get the grease in behind the Cv race to properly lube the joint. I have used this setup for quite a while now and can say that the Lincoln gun and all parts work Flawlessly. I highly recommend the product.
B000C11JHU|5|I hope this one never goes out, me and my hubby put this in and it is not an easy thing to do at all.
B00B5ZYY38|5|great stuff
B005DMXBVA|1|Very poor quality seat covers, and they dont fit the seat and it did not say in the description that you shouldnt use on seats with airbags.  The purple slice stuff does not work so dont waste your money on it.  The steering wheel cover is nice...too bad it isn't worth the $50 I spent on the set.
B000O2PLN0|5|Got this for a 2010 Silverado Regular Cab, which I just traded in for a 2012 Silverado Ext cab, same size bed. Swapped it over to the new truck in a matter of minutes while the finance department was getting paperwork ready for my wife and I to sign.<br /><br />Love the Signature series canvas look over the standard vinyl, though I was worried it'd be harder to clean. But just as the other reviewer mentioned, all it takes is a nice rain and the bird poop is gone! I've gone through an automatic car wash with the high speed blowers to dry things at the end, and had no issues with the cover. Stayed put just fine! Drove around at highway speeds with it folded forward and secured with the two included straps without issue as well.<br /><br />The ease of installation is a great benefit if you ever have to take the cover off completely to haul larger items. No tools needed other than your hands! Its just two spring loaded clamps at the tailgate end, and two wingnuts toward the front and it lifts off completely, leaving no rails or anything else to get in the way.<br /><br />When I first picked up the package at the local UPS facility, there were signs of the box being re-taped, but no damage to the cover at all. Very securely packaged. Everything appeared to be intact, but when I got home and read the instructions, I found that the pads that should have been included to prevent paint rubbing from the clamps were missing. I sent customer service an email(I don't like calling) and had replacements in the mail in a matter of days at no charge. Excellent customer service!
B00RUE1S9G|5|These fit well on my bike and a lot cheaper than buyng at the dealership .
B002SZXEBC|5|My wife said my Metro rode like a truck.  I installed a set of these and H&R springs, and it made a world of difference!  The car rides better and it handles now like it's on rails.  If you have a Metro, this is the setup you need for it!!
B00FJUEO12|5|good cart
B001447UVS|1|Poor quality in comparison to Mercury original parts.  Kit does not include diaphram either.
B001N8C812|5|fits good without using the velcro strips
B0018LKZMI|5|Perfect fit for my Silverado 2004 Stepside 4WD 5.3 v8 Reg Cab.<br />It refreshed the suspension and feels like a new truck!<br />Very happy with this.
B00L841BTG|5|Fit perfectly with some minor trimming of the bumper cover. Look OEM. Comes with OEM type dashboard swtich and all high quality wiring. Very pleased!
B00KRXVAH2|5|Bought it as a gift. The receiver is really satisfied.
B000P6UT2I|5|This puller made removing the bottom pulley on my PT Cruiser a snack. A lot of complaints on forums say this was a hard job , but the puller removed it in a couple of minutes and the cost was minimal compared to what I could get here.<br />Don't mess about get this puller
B0068FVNYI|5|I have not used the Giegerrig extensively but it feels look a solid piece of gear. It is made in China but it is a US patent so it is made to US specs. The Giegerrig hydration bladder can do any thing a traditional hydration bladder can do on top of what it can do. If you still need more information to buy go to you tube and search Giegerrig hydration bladder pressurized hydration bladder.
B002R1E39E|4|Just like original.
B00480N10O|1|The different colors are cool but the colors do not shine in the right direction. It is yellow on the top of the beam and the blue doesn't really show up... but I think its on the bottom. More of a pain then a help!
B008G3KG70|4|They're good but not as great. Not as bright as I wanted them to be.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works flawlessly with my 2003 Lincoln Town Car and Pumpkin Full Android 4.4.4 DVD/NAVhead unit and TORQUE app.<br />Also works with TORQUE on my Samsung G4.<br /><br />Be aware that you must update the Pumpkins MCU firmware (v2.55 or higher) for it to work. It will not work with the stock out-of-box firmware.
B0010Z4MDK|5|vary nice fit ok looks vaey good works vary good looks like it will last a vary long time so
B000CSBLLW|5|works easy to programs better than the original. would  most likey buy one one more for a spare, the remote starter is not much good with out it.
B00REJXVEW|5|Easy as 1 2 3 to install and removes easily.
B000ALJ4NS|5|Rear view mirror is still holding up three months later.  Product has an easy application process.  Remember to mark where you mirror goes by drawing an outline on the exterior of the windshield.
B00068XCQU|5|Keeps the battery for my 68 Chrysler in top shape for the winter.
B001GSIJYE|5|Haven't figured out how to put it on yet. Once I figured that out I am sure I will be pleased. Instructions aren't as easy as they look.
B000KZ2YEU|3|This remove fob for the TL is well used, but an original equipment device. It installed in minutes and has worked ever since. Only drawback is the appearance, but the price was right.
B00D03D1SW|4|The connector plug works as it's supposed to.  I relocated my knock sensor on top of the upper intake manifold on a Mercury Villager 97.  The wire lengths were long enough for the relocation.  No complaints.
